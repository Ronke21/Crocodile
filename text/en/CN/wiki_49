<text>The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM; , &quot;&quot;) is an opposition group in Sudan founded by Khalil Ibrahim. Gibril Ibrahim has led the group since January 2012 after the death of Khalil, his brother, in December 2011. The JEM supported the removal of President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir and nation-wide government reform.

==Formation and organization==

The Justice and Equality Movement trace their origin to the writers of &quot;The Black Book: Imbalance of Power and Wealth in the Sudan&quot;, a manuscript published in 2000 that details what it views as the structural inequality in the country; the JEM&#x27;s founder, Khalil Ibrahim, was one of the authors. 

The JEM claims to number around 35,000 with an ethnically diverse membership. According to critics it is not the &quot;rainbow of tribes&quot; it claims to be, as most JEM members, including its leader, are from the Zaghawa tribe. The JEM is part of the Sudan Revolutionary Front (SRF), an alliance of groups opposed to the Government of Sudan.

==History of attacks==
===Raids on Haskanita===
In the September and October 2007 raids on Haskanita JEM units attacked the African Union Mission in Sudan. Three JEM leaders, Bahr Idriss Abu Garda, Abdallah Banda Abakaer Nourain and Saleh Mohammed Jerbo Jamus, were charged by the International Criminal Court (ICC) of war crimes. The case against Garda was dropped due to lack of evidence and the case against Jerbo was dropped after his presumed death on 19 April 2013. , Banda was considered a fugitive by the ICC.

===Oilfield attacks and anti-government operations===
In October 2007, the JEM attacked the Defra oilfield in the Kordofan region of Sudan. The Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company, a Chinese-led consortium, controls the field. The next month, a group of 135 Chinese engineers arrived in Darfur to work on the Defra field. Ibrahim told reporters, &quot;We oppose them coming because the Chinese are not interested in human rights. [They are] just interested in Sudan&#x27;s resources.&quot; The JEM claims that the revenue from oil sold to China funds the Sudanese government and the Janjaweed militia.

On the morning of December 11, 2007, Khalil Ibrahim claimed that JEM forces fought and defeated Sudanese government troops guarding a Chinese-run oilfield in the Kordofan region. Khartoum officials, however, denied that any oil fields had come under attack. Ibrahim said that the attack was part of a JEM campaign to rid Sudan of Chinese-run oilfields and stated that &quot;[The JEM] want all Chinese companies to leave. They have been warned many times. They should not be there.&quot;

===2008–2013 Khartoum attack and continued battles===
In May 2008, JEM engaged in its most famous operation against the Sudanese government when it attacked the Sudanese capital of Khartoum. JEM&#x27;s advance recorded many impressive gains which included temporarily controlling the city of Omdurman, the airport at the Wadi Sayedna military base, north of Khartoum, and three bridges leading into the capital. The operation ended with heavy battles in the western part of the Sudanese capital that included the government&#x27;s use of army helicopters to repel the JEM advance. Following this battle, Eltahir Elfaki, the General Secretary of JEM&#x27;s legislative council, vowed that the war would henceforth be fought across the country, saying that &quot;We haven&#x27;t changed our tactics. From the beginning, Jem is a national movement and it has a national agenda.&quot; Khalil Ibrahim declared that &quot;This is just the start of a process and the end is the termination of this regime&quot;.

In April 2013, JEM and its allies in the Sudan Revolutionary Front engaged in many successful attacks against Sudanese government forces. In a raid coordinated between all the parties of the SRF that included the use of 20 vehicles, the opposition forces briefly held the strategic city of Um Rawaba in North Kordofan, located south of Khartoum. As part of the offensive, JEM and the SRF also gained control of Abu Korshola, a strategic town of 40,000 in South Kordofan. In its bid to retake control, the Sudanese Armed Forces engaged in indiscriminate air raid campaigns. On May 27, the opposition forces withdrew in order to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered to the area&#x27;s residents. During 2013, opposition forces continued to engage in offensive operations, leading to dozens of casualties for Sudanese forces around Abu Korshola.

==August 2020 peace agreement==
The Justice and Equality Movement signed a peace agreement with the Transitional Government of Sudan on 31 August 2020 and will now participate in the transition to democracy in Sudan through peaceful means. Under the terms of the agreement, the factions that signed will be entitled to three seats on the sovereignty council, a total of five ministers in the transitional cabinet and a quarter of seats in the transitional legislature. At a regional level, signatories will be entitled between 30 and 40% of the seats on transitional legislatures of their home states or regions.

<doc id="1246507" wikidata="Q7873186" url="?curid=1246507" title="USS Queen of the West">
<text>The USS &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was a sidewheel steamer ram ship and the flagship of the United States Ram Fleet and the Mississippi Marine Brigade. It was built at Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1854. It served as a commercial steamer until purchased by Colonel Charles Ellet Jr. in 1862 and converted for use as a ram ship. The ship operated in conjunction with the Mississippi River Squadron during the Union brown-water navy battle against the Confederate River Defense Fleet for control of the Mississippi River and its tributaries during the American Civil War.

The ship played a critical role in the Union Navy victory at the First Battle of Memphis and sank the Confederate flagship . In actions south of Vicksburg, Mississippi, she severely damaged the CSS &quot;City of Vicksburg&quot; and captured four transport ships supplying Confederate forces.

On February 14, 1863, the USS &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was captured by Confederate forces on the Red River, repaired and returned to service as the CSS &quot;Queen of the West&quot;. Together with the , it was used to force the surrender of the on the Mississippi River.

On April 11, 1863, she was attacked and destroyed on the Atchafalaya River by the USS &quot;Estrella&quot;, USS &quot;Calhoun&quot; and USS &quot;Arizona&quot;.

==Service as USS &quot;Queen of the West&quot;==

The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was built in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1854 and served as a commercial steamer. She was purchased by Charles Ellet, Jr. in 1862 due to her speed and converted for usage as a ram ship. The hull was reinforced, the forward end filled with hard oak wood, the steam-engine secured and the pilot house protected by thick wooden planks. Three longitudinal bulkheads were added and supported with iron bars. A central beam was installed from bow to stern and iron peaks were installed on the bow. A large ornamental &quot;Q&quot; was installed in the support cables between the twin chimney stacks. She was originally not equipped with any guns. The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was designated as Colonel Ellet&#x27;s flagship of the United States Ram Fleet.

On May 25, the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; and the ram fleet joined the Mississippi River Squadron, led by Charles H. Davis, on the Mississippi River north of Fort Pillow. Davis had little faith in the effectiveness of the rams but allowed the fleet to accompany his gunboats down the river to Memphis.

===First Battle of Memphis===

On June 6, Colonel Charles Ellet, Jr. led the ram ships in the First Battle of Memphis as captain of the &quot;Queen of the West&quot;. Ellet had not coordinated a plan of attack with Davis and when the flotilla approached Confederate forces, the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; and the USS &quot;Monarch&quot; steamed ahead of Davis&#x27; gunboats. The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; rammed and sank the Confederate flagship . After the collision, the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; came under attack from the and the CSS &quot;Beauregard&quot;. The attack sheared off one of the paddle wheels from the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; and forced her to ground on the riverbank. Ellet was wounded in the knee by a Confederate sharpshooter during the battle. His wound was the only serious casualty received on the Union side during the battle. Ellet died 15 days from a blood infection due to the injury. Ellet&#x27;s brother, Alfred W. Ellet took command of the ram fleet and his son Charles Rivers Ellet became captain of the &quot;Queen of the West&quot;.

===Actions near Vicksburg===

On July 15, the &quot;Queen of the West&quot;, , and engaged the Confederate ironclad ram in the Yazoo River. The &quot;Arkansas&quot; was heavily damaged but escaped into the Mississippi and took refuge under the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Mississippi. On July 22, &quot;Queen of the West&quot; and attacked &quot;Arkansas&quot;, despite the batteries at Vicksburg. The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; rammed the &quot;Arkansas&quot; but inflicted only minor damage and rejoined the Mississippi River Squadron ships above Vicksburg.

The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; continued to support operations against Vicksburg. On September 19, while escorting two transport barges, the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; had a short engagement with Confederate infantry and artillery on the Mississippi River above Bolivar, Mississippi. The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; also conducted operations in the Yazoo River clearing mines and engaging Confederate batteries.

In November 1862, the Mississippi Marine Brigade, an amphibious raiding unit, was organized by Alfred W. Ellet. The ram fleet including the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was incorporated as a part of the brigade. On November 5, Charles Rivers Ellet was promoted to the rank of colonel and assigned command of the ram fleet.

On December 12, 1862, the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was one of the ships that accompanied the up the Yazoo River. The &quot;Cairo&quot; was struck by a &#x27;torpedo&#x27; or naval mine and began to sink rapidly. The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was able to rescue part of the crew from the &quot;Cairo&quot; before it sank.

On February 2, 1863, Charles Rivers Ellet was ordered by Admiral David Dixon Porter to run the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; past the batteries at Vicksburg, Mississippi to support Admiral David Farragut below the city. The boat was equipped with a 30-pounder bow gun, three 12-pounder howitzers, cotton bales and wooden sheathing for protection. Ellet intended to &quot;run the gauntlet&quot; of Vicksburg by cover of night, however delays resulted in passage of the guns at daybreak. The guns at Vicksburg fired for 50 minutes straight. The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; took 12 hits and lost a gun but made it past the batteries with minimal damage. The run provided the Union forces with insight as to where the guns at Vicksburg were positioned.
Once past the batteries, the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; found the &quot;City of&quot; &quot;Vicksburg&quot; docked, rammed her, and set her ablaze with turpentine-soaked balls fired from the forward gun. The &quot;City of Vicksburg&quot; was severely damaged but not destroyed. The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; had to disengage before destroying the &quot;City of Vicksburg&quot; due to enemy fire which set the cotton bales aboard the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; ablaze.

The Union forces supplied the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; with fuel by floating an unmanned coal barge filled with 20,000 bushels of coal past the Vicksburg batteries at night. The barge went unnoticed by the Confederate forces and floated downriver 10 miles before being intercepted by the &quot;Queen of the West&quot;. The barge provided the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; with enough fuel to continue her mission.

On February 3, the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; captured three Confederate transport ships - the CSS &quot;A.W. Baker&quot;, CSS &quot;Moro&quot; and CSS &quot;Berwick Bay&quot;. The &quot;Moro&quot; was empty of cargo since it had just dropped off supplies at Port Hudson, Louisiana. The other two ships were laden with food supplies headed toward Vicksburg.

The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; rendezvoused with the &quot;De Soto&quot; and on February 12, both ships went down the Atchafalaya River to Simmesport, Louisiana in search of Confederate forces. The crew went ashore, destroyed all supplies found and looted the residential area. On the way back up the Mississippi River, the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; received Confederate gun fire and the 1st mate was injured. In retaliation, Ellet and his crew burned three plantations that were believed to be the residences of those that injured the 1st mate.

===Loss of the Queen of the West===

On February 14, the &quot;Queen of the West&quot; and &quot;De Soto&quot; went up the Red River and captured the steamboat Era No. 5 carrying 4,500 bushels of corn. The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; continued upstream to investigate reports of steamships at Gordon&#x27;s Landing near Marksville, Louisiana. She came under heavy fire by the shore batteries of Fort DeRussy and was run aground onto the right bank by her pilot instead of backing down river as ordered. She was directly in the sight of Confederate guns, which pounded her until Ellet ordered &quot;abandon ship&quot;. Ellet and the crew escaped and floated downstream on bales of cotton and were rescued by the &quot;De Soto&quot;. The &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was not burned out of concern for the 1st mate, who was wounded and could not be moved. The USS &quot;Queen of the West&quot; was captured, repaired and re-entered into service as the CSS &quot;Queen of the West&quot; by the Confederate forces.

==Service as CSS &quot;Queen of the West&quot;==

In conjunction with the Confederate ram, , she forced the surrender of in the Mississippi River below Vicksburg on February 24. On April 11, 1863, she was attacked on the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana by Union ships , , and . A shell from &quot;Calhoun&quot; set fire to &quot;Queen of the West&quot;&#x27;s cotton, and her burning wreck drifted down the river for several hours before she grounded and exploded. 90 members of the Confederate crew were captured and 26 killed.

<doc id="1246524" wikidata="Q1638139" url="?curid=1246524" title="Hunter Liggett">
<text>Hunter Liggett (March 21, 1857 − December 30, 1935) was a senior United States Army officer. His 42 years of military service spanned the period from the Indian campaigns to the trench warfare of World War I. Additionally, he also identified possible invasion sites in Luzon, particularly Lingayen Gulf, which were used during World War II in 1941 by the Japanese and in 1945 by the United States.

==Early life ==
Liggett was born on March 21, 1857, in Reading, Pennsylvania. He attended, and later graduated, from the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, as a second lieutenant in 1879. Among his classmates included several general officers of the future, such as William D. Beach, John S. Mallory, James A. Irons, Lloyd M. Brett, Albert L. Mills, John A. Johnston, Henry A. Greene, Frederick S. Foltz and Samuel W. Miller.

After his graduation, he was assigned to the 5th Infantry, where he served in both the Montana and Dakota territories, as well as Texas and Florida, during which time he reached the rank of captain.

Liggett&#x27;s field service in the American west, the Spanish–American War, and the Philippine–American War honed his skills as a military leader. In 1907, he assumed command of a battalion of the 13th Infantry Regiment at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. From 1909 to 1914, he served as student, faculty member, and president at the Army War College, receiving a promotion to brigadier general in February 1913.

Liggett&#x27;s services in the Philippines included setting up a staff ride in 1914 to study possible invasion sites on Luzon. He was assisted in this by his aide-de-camp, Captain George C. Marshall. The staff ride established that the most likely invasion route would be through Lingayen Gulf and that this would be all but unstoppable unless the US dramatically increased its army and navy forces in the Philippines. In 1941, the Japanese invaded through Lingayen Gulf, as the United States did in turn in 1945.

==World War I==

Success in brigade commands in Texas and in the Philippines led to his promotion to major general, and selection as commander of the 41st Division in April 1917. The division served in France as part of the American Expeditionary Force. When his division was disestablished, he took command of I Corps.

Under Liggett&#x27;s leadership, the I Corps participated in the Second Battle of the Marne and in the reduction of the Saint-Mihiel salient. In October 1918, as commander of the First United States Army with the rank of lieutenant general in the national army, he directed the final phases of the Meuse-Argonne offensive and the pursuit of German forces until the armistice. After commanding the post-war Army of Occupation, Liggett returned to his permanent rank of major general, and retired in 1921.

Throughout most of this period, Liggett&#x27;s aide-de-camp was James Garesche Ord, a major general in World War II.

==Retirement and death==
Liggett wrote about his war time experiences in &quot;A.E.F.: Ten Years Ago in France&quot; (1928). In 1930, Congress passed a law permitting World War I general officers to retire at the highest rank they had held, and Liggett was promoted to lieutenant general on the retired list. He died December 30, 1935, in San Francisco, California, and is interred at the San Francisco National Cemetery.

In his honor, the United States Army named a base on California&#x27;s central coast, Fort Hunter Liggett.

Liggett Hall is a regimental-sized barracks building constructed at Fort Jay on Governors Island in New York Harbor. Completed in 1930, it was thought to be the largest building constructed by the U.S. Army and was the largest structure built under the supervision of the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps. It was superseded by the Pentagon, constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1943.

The was a passenger ship that was transferred to the Army and renamed Hunter Liggett in February 1939. The ship transported personnel and supplies until May 27, 1941, when she was turned over to the Navy. Converted to Navy use at Brooklyn Navy Yard, she re-commissioned as AP-27 June 9, 1941, and then again reclassified APA-14 February 1, 1943, for the United States Coast Guard.

<doc id="1246527" wikidata="Q5486966" url="?curid=1246527" title="HMS Ambuscade (1913)">
<text>HMS &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was an of the Royal Navy and was launched in 1913. She served throughout the First World War, forming part of the Grand Fleet and taking part at the Battle of Jutland, serving in the Dover Patrol and spending the latter part of the war as a convoy escort. She was sold for scrapping in 1921.

==Construction==
&quot;Ambuscade&quot; was one of three s ordered from John Brown &amp; Company of Clydebank as part of the 1911–1912 shipbuilding programme for the Royal Navy. In all, 20 &quot;Acasta&quot;-class ships were ordered as part of this programme, of which 12, including &quot;Ambuscade&quot;, were to the standard Admiralty design with the other eight ships to their builder&#x27;s own designs. She was laid down, as yard number 411, on 7 March 1912 and launched on 25 January 1913. In 1912, as part of a general reorganisation of the Royal Navy&#x27;s destroyers into alphabetical classes, the &quot;Acasta&quot;s became the K class, and in 1913, it was decided to switch to names beginning with the class letter, with &quot;Ambuscade&quot; being allocated the name &quot;Keith&quot;, but this plan was abandoned for the class and &quot;Ambuscade&quot; completed under her original name in June 1913.

&quot;Ambuscade&quot; was long between perpendiculars and overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Four Yarrow boilers fed steam to direct drive Brown-Curtis steam turbines rated at and driving two shafts. This gave a speed of . The ships had a crew of 73 officers and ratings.

The ship&#x27;s main gun armament consisted of three BL Mk VIII guns, with 120 rounds of ammunition carried per gun. Two  torpedo tubes were fitted, while two reload torpedoes could be carried. The ship was fitted with a 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; anti-aircraft autocannon during the First World War, while in 1918 the torpedo tubes (and possibly one of the 4-inch guns) was removed to allow a heavy depth charge armament to be carried.

==Service==

On commissioning, &quot;Ambuscade&quot;, with her sister ships, joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla of the Royal Navy Home Fleet, based at Portsmouth. On the outbreak of the First World War, the 4th Flotilla, including &quot;Ambuscade&quot;, became part of the Grand Fleet.

On 15 December 1914, German battlecruisers, supported by the battleships of the main German High Seas Fleet set out on a raid against the coastal towns of Scarborough, Whitby and Hartlepool, with the intent of drawing out units of the British Grand Fleet, where they could be engaged by the battleships of the High Seas Fleet. The British, aware from radio intercepts that the Germans were planning a raid with their battlecruisers (but not that they were supported by the whole of the High Seas Fleet), sent out the battlecruiser squadron under Vice Admiral David Beatty with four battlecruisers and the Second Battle Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral Sir George Warrender, with six battleships, to oppose the raid. &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was one of seven destroyers that sailed in support of the British battlecruiser squadron. At 05:15 on 16 December, the lead ship of the British destroyers, , spotted a German destroyer, (part of the screen of the High Seas Fleet) and set off with the other destroyers in pursuit of the German ship. In a brief exchange of fire, &quot;V155&quot; hit &quot;Lynx&quot; twice, with &quot;Lynx&quot; turning away due to a jammed propeller, and then hit &quot;Ambuscade&quot; once below the waterline, forcing her to drop out of line with heavy flooding. Clashes between the British destroyers and the destroyers and cruisers of the High Seas Fleet&#x27;s screen continued, causing further serious damage to &quot;Lynx&quot; and to , but the encounters caused Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, fearing that the whole Grand Fleet was at sea, to withdraw.

On 21 April 1916, the Grand Fleet sailed on a sortie where it would patrol off the Danish coast with the intention of distracting German attention from Russian minelaying operations in the Baltic Sea. Heavy fog was encountered, however, and &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was involved in a collision with the destroyers and &quot;Hardy&quot;, with &quot;Ardent&quot; being damaged severely enough that she had to be towed stern first back to port, while collisions also occurred between the battlecruisers and , and between the battleship and a neutral merchant ship.

&quot;Ambuscade&quot; took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May/1 June 1916, sailing under the command of Commander Gordon A. Coles as one of 19 ships of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla in support of the Grand Fleet. During the fleet action on the evening of 31 May, the 4th Flotilla was deployed on the port side of the battleships of the Grand Fleet, on the unengaged side. During the night, the 4th Flotilla, including &quot;Ambuscade&quot;, took part in a series of attacks against the escaping German fleet. In the first attack (at about 23:30 hr), the flotilla encountered German battleships and cruisers, with the flotilla leader being badly damaged by German shells (mainly from the battleship ) and later sinking, while collided with the German battleship and the German cruiser was rammed by the battleship , with &quot;Elbing&quot; later being scuttled. None of the nine torpedoes fired by the 4th Flotilla in that attack hit. Shortly afterwards (about 23:50), the flotilla, now led by again encountered the same group of battleships and cruisers. &quot;Broke&quot; was badly damaged by fire from the cruiser and &quot;Westfalen&quot;, and collided with the destroyer , which was also rammed by and was later scuttled. &quot;Rostock&quot; was hit by a single torpedo, fired by &quot;Ambuscade&quot; or &quot;Contest&quot;, and was also later scuttled. At about 00:10 hr, a third attack was made, with being sunk and being damaged, with none of the five torpedoes fired by the British destroyers, including &quot;Ambuscade&quot;″s last, striking home. By now, the flotilla had completely split up, but was to lose a fourth ship when &quot;Ardent&quot;, mistaking the German ships for British ships, was sunk by fire from German battleships.

The 4th Flotilla, including &quot;Ambuscade&quot;, left the Grand Fleet and moved to the Humber in July 1916, with the role of protecting British minesweepers and deterring German minelayers off the East coast of England. Late in the year, in a response to the Battle of Dover Strait, where a raid by German torpedo boats on the Dover Strait resulted in the loss of the destroyer , several drifters, it was decided to strengthen British naval forces in the English Channel. The 4th Flotilla was transferred to Portsmouth for anti-submarine operations while &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was one of five destroyers that were transferred from the 4th to the 6th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Dover Patrol, to reinforce the defences of the Dover Strait. &quot;Ambuscade&quot; joined the 6th Flotilla on 21 November 1916. On the night of 25/26 February 1917, German torpedo boats attempted another raid against the Dover Barrage and Allied shipping in the Dover Straits, with one flotilla attacking the Barrage and a half flotilla of torpedo boats operating off the Kent coast. &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was one of a group of destroyers and cruisers protecting shipping anchored in the Downs. The German force sent against the Downs was spotted near the north entrance to the Downs, prior to shelling Margate and Westgate-on-Sea. While the division of ships including &quot;Ambuscade&quot; sortied against this force, they did not manage to find the German force. The southern German force withdrew following an exchange of gunfire with the destroyer . &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was again part of the force protecting the Downs when the Germans raided again on the night of 17/18 March 1917. Again, the German plan involved multiple attacks, against the Dover Barrage and off the Kent coast. The destroyer was sunk during the German attack against the Barrage, with being torpedoed but surviving when investigating the attack. The northern German force torpedoed and sunk a merchant ship () anchored outside the entrance to the Downs, and then shelled Ramsgate and Broadstairs before withdrawing. They were spotted by the British torpedo boat which signaled for help, summoning the naval force protecting the Downs, including &quot;Ambuscade&quot;, but again the German force managed to escape without being engaged.

On 4 April 1917 &quot;Ambuscade&quot; left the 6th Flotilla, rejoining the 4th Flotilla, now based at Devonport and employed on convoy escort duties. On 14 May 1918, &quot;Ambuscade&quot;, on patrol with and , detected a possible submarine contact with her hydrophone. She and &quot;Cockatrice&quot; attacked with depth charges with no apparent result. &quot;Ambuscade&quot; was still part of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla in August 1918, but by the end of the war had joined the Northern Patrol Force based at Dundee. By June 1919, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; had been reduced to reserve at Devonport.

==Disposal==
She was sold for scrap to Petersen &amp; Albeck of Denmark on 6 September 1921.

<text>Clarence Walton Lillehei (October 23, 1918 – July 5, 1999), was an American surgeon who pioneered open-heart surgery, as well as numerous techniques, equipment and prostheses for cardiothoracic surgery.

==Background==
Clarence (often called &quot;Walt&quot;) Lillehei was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Clarence Ingvald Lillehei (1892-1973) and Elizabeth Lillian (Walton) Lillehei (1891-1973). He attended West High School in Minneapolis in 1935. He attended the University of Minnesota at the age of 17. He earned four degrees at the University of Minnesota: a B.S. (with distinction) in 1939, an M.D. (Alpha Omega Alpha) in 1942, a M.S. in physiology in 1951, and a Ph.D. in surgery in 1951.

==Career==
In 1944, Alfred Blalock at Johns Hopkins Hospital began successfully performing surgery on the great vessels around the heart to relieve the symptoms of tetralogy of Fallot, demonstrating that heart surgery could be possible. Lillehei participated in the first successful surgical repair of the heart on 2 September 1952. That historic operation, using hypothermia, was led by his longtime friend and colleague, F. John Lewis. Lillehei was a professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Minnesota from 1951 to 1967.

Hypothermia gave only a relatively brief time, up to 10 minutes, during which surgery could be performed and was therefore not suited for complex congenital defects within the heart. To resolve this problem, Lillehei performed operations using cross-circulation, in which a donor was hooked up nearby to take up the pumping and oxygenation functions of the patient who was being operated on. Using this technique, Lillehei led the team that performed successful repair of a ventricular septal defect on March 26, 1954. Although the repair was successful, the patient, 13-month-old Gregory Glidden, died 11 days later of suspected pneumonia. Lillehei and his team continued to use cross-circulation for a total of 44 open-heart operations in the following year, of which 32 patients survived. These operations included the first repairs of the atrioventricular canal and tetralogy of Fallot.

Lillehei cooperated with Professor Moshe Gueron and Professor Morris J. Levy, who were both considered among &quot;The Cardiology Founders of Israel&quot; by doing the first cardiac puncture catheterization, which was used on 80 patients in 1964.

In 1958, Lillehei was responsible for the world&#x27;s first use of a small, external, portable, battery-powered pacemaker. It was invented at his behest by Earl Bakken, whose then-small company, Medtronic, designed and repaired electronics for the University of Minnesota hospital. After the introduction of the first widely used prosthetic heart valves by Albert Starr in 1961, Lillehei also developed and implanted several innovative designs: the Lillehei-Nakib toroidal disc (1966), the Lillehei-Kaster pivoting disc (1967), and the Kalke-Lillehei rigid bileaflet prosthesis (1968).

As a dedicated educator, Lillehei trained more than 150 cardiac surgeons from 40 nations, including Norman Shumway and Christiaan Barnard, who formed half of the quartet which pioneered heart transplantation (the others being Richard Lower and Adrian Kantrowitz). In 1967, he was appointed Lewis Atterbury Stimson professor and chairman of the surgery department at Cornell Medical Center, New York. He returned to St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1975, where he became the director of medical affairs at St. Jude Medical. He was also named a clinical professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Minnesota.

==Honors==
Lillehei&#x27;s honors include the Bronze Star for World War II service in Italy, the 1955 Lasker Award, the Order of Health Merit Jose Fernandez Madrid by the government of Colombia in 1959, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1968, induction in 1993 into the Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame, and the 1996 Harvey Prize in Science and Technology. In 1966-67, he served as president of the American College of Cardiology.

==Personal life==
In 1946, Lillehei was married to Katherine Ruth (Lindberg) Lillehei (1921-2012) with whom he had four children. He died in 1999 and was buried at Fort Snelling National Cemetery.

His youngest brother, Richard C. Lillehei, was a notable transplant surgeon in his own right, having participated in the world&#x27;s first successful transplant of a pancreas in 1966 and the first known human transplant of the small and large intestines.

<text>A modal frame in music is &quot;a number of types permeating and unifying African, European, and American song&quot; and melody. It may also be called a melodic mode. &quot;Mode&quot; and &quot;frame&quot; are used interchangeably in this context without reference to scalar or rhythmic modes. Melodic modes define and generate melodies that are not determined by harmony, but purely by melody. A note frame, is a melodic mode that is atonic (without a tonic), or has an unstable tonic.

Modal frames may be defined by their:

*floor note: the bottom of the frame, felt to be the lowest note, though isolated notes may go lower,
*ceiling note: the top of the frame,
*central note: the center around which other notes cluster or gravitate,
*upper or lower focus: portion of the mode on which the melody temporarily dwells, and can also defined by melody types, such as:
**[[chant]] tunes: (Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;)
**axial tunes: (&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, &quot;Peggy Sue&quot;, Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Can I Get A Witness&quot;, and Roy Milton&#x27;s &quot;Do the Hucklebuck&quot;)
**oscillating: (Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot;)
**open/closed: (Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Hey Bo Diddley&quot;)
**[[melodic motion|terrace]]
**[[#Shout-and-fall|shout-and-fall]]
**[[#Ladder of thirds|ladder of thirds]]

&lt;score sound=1&gt;\relative c&quot; { \repeat volta 1 { \time 2/2 \tempo 2 = 60 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t c2 a ^&quot;↓&quot; c a ^&quot;↓&quot;} } \addlyrics { Chel -- sea Chel -- sea } &lt;/score&gt;
&quot;Chel-sea&quot; football crowd chant: minor third.

Further defined features include:
*melodic dissonance: the quality of a note that is modally unstable and attracted to other more important tones in a non-harmonic way
*melodic triad: arpeggiated triads in a melody. A non-harmonic arpeggio is most commonly a melodic triad, it is an arpeggio the notes of which do not appear in the harmony of the accompaniment.
*level: a temporary modal frame contrasted with another built on a different foundation note. A change in levels is called a shift.
*co-tonic: a melodic tonic different from and as important as the harmonic tonic
*secondary tonic: a melodic tonic different from but subordinate to the harmonic tonic
*pendular third: alternating notes a third apart, most often a neutral, see double tonic

==Shout-and-fall==
Shout-and-fall or tumbling strain is a modal frame, &quot;very common in Afro-American-derived styles&quot; and featured in songs such as &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot;.

&quot;Gesturally, it suggests &#x27;affective outpouring&#x27;, &#x27;self-offering of the body&#x27;, &#x27;emptying and relaxation&#x27;.&quot; The frame may be thought of as a deep structure common to the varied surface structures of songs in which it occurs.

==Ladder of thirds==
A ladder of thirds (coined by van der Merwe 1989, adapted from Curt Sachs) is similar to the circle of fifths, though a ladder of thirds differs in being composed of thirds, major or minor, and may or may not circle back to its starting note and thus may or may not be an interval cycle.

Triadic chords may be considered as part of a ladder of thirds.

It is a modal frame found in Blues and British folk music. Though a pentatonic scale is often analyzed as a portion of the circle of fifths, the blues scale and melodies in that scale come &quot;into being through piling up thirds below and/or above a tonic or central note.&quot;

They are &quot;commonplace in post-rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll popular music – and also appear in earlier tunes&quot;. Examples include The Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; and The Who&#x27;s &quot;My Generation&quot;, Ben Harney&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;ve Been A Good Old Wagon&quot; (1895) and Ben Bernie et al.&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; (1925).

===Example===
The modal frame of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; features a ladder of thirds axially centered on G with a ceiling note of B and floor note of E[] (the low C being a passing tone):

According to Middleton, the song, &quot;at first glance major-key-with-modal-touches&quot;, reveals through its &quot;Line of Latent Mode&quot; &quot;a deep kinship with typical blues melodic structures: it is centred on three of the notes of the minor-pentatonic mode [on C: C, E-flat, F, G, B-flat] (E-G-B), with the contradictory major seventh (B) set against that. Moreover, the &quot;shape&quot; assumed by these notes – the modal &quot;frame&quot; – as well as the abstract scale they represent, is revealed, too; and this – an initial, repeated circling round the dominant (G), with an excursion to its minor third (B), &#x27;answered&#x27; by a fall to the &#x27;symmetrical&#x27; minor third of the tonic (E) – is a common pattern in blues.&quot;

<doc id="1246555" wikidata="Q1926416" url="?curid=1246555" title="Wychwood Brewery">
<text>Wychwood Brewery was a brewery and pub chain based in Witney, Oxfordshire, England. the brand is currently owned by Marston&#x27;s Brewery. Hobgoblin, a 5.2% abv brown ale, was the company&#x27;s flagship brand.

Wychwood Brewery produced around 50,000 barrels () of cask ale each year, and was the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest brewer of organic ales. Wychwood filtered and bottled beers are exported all over the world by their export partners Sovereign Beverage Company, to countries including North America, Germany, Sweden, France, Australia, Russia, Japan, Israel and Singapore.
The brewery was known for its character-based label artwork, inspired by the myths and legends surrounding the ancient Wychwood Forest.

Carlsberg Marston’s Brewing Company (CMBC) closed the brewery in November 2023.

== History ==
The brewery was sited at the old Eagle Maltings, built in 1841 to malt barley for Clinch&#x27;s brewery which had an estate of seventy-one pubs in Southern England. In 1961, Courage bought Clinch&#x27;s for its pub estate and closed down the brewery.

In 1983, part of the original Clinch&#x27;s Eagle Brewery site was rented by Paddy Glenny, but named the brewing company Glenny Brewery. Chris Moss took his interest in exchange for a debt from Paddy and took over after Paddy Kenny moved away. In 1990, the Eagle was renamed the Wychwood Brewery after the ancient Wychwood Forest which borders Witney, at the same time the brewery moved to the Two Rivers Industrial estate still in Witney. 

In 1993, 3i became a key investor in the business. In 1994 the brewery was moved back to the site taking on more of the old site. 

In 2001, managing director Chris Moss died. 3i put the business up for sale. The brewery was acquired in 2002 by Refresh UK and its 29 Hobgoblin pubs were acquired by Balaclava. The Hobgoblin pubs went through difficult times with new owner Balaclava falling into administration in 2003, which was then acquired by Pubs &#x27;N&#x27; Bars plc. Pubs &#x27;N&#x27; Bars then itself fell into administration in 2009. The pubs were sold off separately, losing their Hobgoblin branding.

In 2008, Marston&#x27;s bought Refresh UK including Wychwood Brewery. Marston&#x27;s brewing operations, including Wychwood Brewery, were merged with Carlsberg UK to form Carlsberg Marston’s Brewing Company in 2020.

In September 2023 Carlsberg Marston’s Brewing Company announced its proposal to close Wychwood Brewery in November 2023 in order to &quot;consolidate our brewing network&quot; amid an &quot;incredibly competitive&quot; UK ale market and a &quot;turbulent economic outlook&quot;. At the time of the announcement the brewery employed six people. In November 2023 the closure went ahead as announced.

==Beers==

===Hobgoblin===
Hobgoblin was the best-known and most popular beer brewed at Wychwood Brewery and was created by Chris Moss. It continues to be marketed in the wake of Wychwood Brewery&#x27;s closure. It is 5.2% abv in bottles, 4.5% in cans and 4.5% (previously 5.0%, and before that 5.6%, and originally 6.5%) on cask, and is described by Wychwood as a &quot;Ruby beer&quot;. Jeremy Moss, Wychwood&#x27;s head brewer, describes the drink as &quot;full bodied and well balanced with a chocolate toffee malt flavour, moderate bitterness and a distinctive fruity character with a ruby red glow&quot;. It was the first bottled beer in the UK to feature an illustrated label, as opposed to a simple text-based one, and it is currently the second best-selling bottled ale in the UK.

During a meeting at the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit, Prime Minister David Cameron and President Barack Obama gave each other bottles of beer from their respective home towns/cities, with Cameron presenting Obama with twelve bottles of Hobgoblin, which is brewed in his Witney constituency. In return Obama gave Cameron 24 bottles of Goose Island beer, from Goose Island Brewery. The President remarked that he would drink his beer chilled, as opposed to the optimal room temperature (15.5 °C/59.9 °F) at which strong ale should be drunk, prompting Wychwood to create a T-shirt in their online store reading &quot;What&#x27;s the matter Obama, afraid you might taste something?&quot;.

===King Goblin===
King Goblin, essentially a stronger and more flavourful variety of Hobgoblin, is a 6.6% abv &quot;Special Reserve&quot; ale. To date it is available bottled in Asda, Sainsburys, Morrisons and Tesco supermarkets, Draeger&#x27;s supermarkets in the US, in &quot;Broken English&quot; shops in Berlin, and on draught during &quot;real ale&quot; festivals at Wetherspoons pubs.

== Brakspear ==
Wychwood took over the brewing of the newly acquired Brakspear beers in October 2002. The new Brakspear brewery was integrated into an expansion of the Wychwood plant, and includes parts of the copper (boiling vessel), as well as some of the fermenting vessels which themselves had been refurbished at Henley. There was only one brewhouse at Witney but two separate fermenting rooms for the separate Wychwood and Brakspear beers. The original Brakspear brewery site in Henley was converted into a boutique hotel.

== Hatherwood ==
Using the name Hatherwood Brewery, Wychwood brewed beers exclusively for the supermarket Lidl. These include:
* Golden Goose
* Ruby Rooster 
* Green Gecko
* Amber Adder
* Purple Panther (porter, 5% ABV)
* Gnarly Fox
* Total Legend (golden ale, 4.5% ABV)

<doc id="1246559" wikidata="Q4874550" url="?curid=1246559" title="Baykok">
<text>The baykok (or pau&#x27;guk, paguk, baguck; bakaak in the Ojibwe language and pakàk in the Algonquin language) is a malevolent spirit from the mythology of the Ojibway nation.

==In traditional culture==

The Baykok is a character from the Anishinaabe &quot;aadizookaan&quot; (traditional stories). It is said to fly through the forests of the Great Lakes region. The cries of Baykok are also described as being shrill. Described as &quot;Death&quot; in &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, it is said to appear as an extremely emaciated skeleton-like figure, with thin translucent skin and glowing red points for eyes. The Baykok only preys upon warriors, but does so ruthlessly, using invisible arrows or beating its prey to death with a club. The Baykok, after paralyzing or killing its prey, then devours the liver of its victim. Baykok was also said to approach a sleeping hunter, gently cut an opening in the chest and remove a piece of the stomach, without waking the victim. 

The word &quot;bakaak&quot; in the Anishinaabe language means &quot;skeleton&quot; in the sense of &quot;bones draped in skin&quot; rather than &quot;bare-bones&quot;, such that it lends itself to words like &quot;bakaakadozo&quot;, meaning &quot;to be thin/skinny/poor&quot;, and &quot;bakaakadwengwe&quot;, meaning &quot;to have a lean/thin face&quot;. The name &quot;Bakaak&quot; occasionally appears as &quot;Bekaak&quot; (reflected in English as &quot;Baykok&quot;), which may be a shortening of &quot;bekaakadwaabewizid&quot;, meaning &quot;an extremely thin being&quot;.

The description of &quot;Bakaak&quot;&#x27;s shrill cries (&quot;bagakwewewin&quot;, literally meaning &quot;clear/distinct cries&quot;) is a pun of its name. The method the &quot;Bakaak&quot; uses to subdue its victim is another pun of its name: the word for &quot;to beat using a club&quot; is &quot;baagaakwaa&#x27;ige&quot;. A similar construct is found in the name for the basketry splints called &quot;baagaako&#x27;igan&quot;, prepared by pounding black ash. Yet another pun on the name is the way the &quot;Bakaak&quot; &quot;flings its victim&#x27;s chest open&quot; (&quot;baakaakwaakiganezh&quot;) to devour the victim&#x27;s liver.

==In popular culture==

First introduced to the non-Anishinaabe public through &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, the baykok is occasionally referenced in modern fiction. Elliot James&#x27; novel &quot;Daring&quot; features a bakaak which hunts werewolves.

The Bakaak is depicted as a race of primordial homonins that preyed upon early humans in Gemma Files&#x27;s short story &quot;Grave Goods&quot;.

The Baykok also appears in the Japanese franchise of role-playing games &quot;Megami Tensei&quot;, in the first two installments of the Shin Megami Tensei series as a demon enemy.

Baykok is depicted in the Minecraft mod Totemic, where it is a skeleton boss with high health and a powerful bow that fires invisible arrows, and must be summoned using a ritual.

The Baykok is a variety of undead creature in the Pathfinder RPG.

<text>IPUMS, originally the &quot;Integrated Public Use Microdata Series&quot;, is the world&#x27;s largest individual-level population database. IPUMS consists of microdata samples from United States &quot;(IPUMS-USA)&quot; and international &quot;(IPUMS-International)&quot; census records, as well as data from U.S. and international surveys. The records are converted into a consistent format and made available to researchers through a web-based data dissemination and analysis system.

IPUMS is housed at the Institute for Social Research and Data Innovation (ISRDI), an interdisciplinary research center at the University of Minnesota, under the direction of Professor Steven Ruggles.

== Description ==

IPUMS includes all persons enumerated in the United States Censuses from 1850 to 1950 (though, the 1890 census is missing because it was destroyed in a fire) and from the American Community Survey since 2000 and the Current Population Survey since 1962. IPUMS includes household-level data for United States Censuses from 1790 to 1840, due to the first six censuses only including the name of the head of household, with tallied household totals following. IPUMS provides consistent variable names, coding schemes, and documentation across all the samples, facilitating the analysis of long-term change.

IPUMS-International includes countries from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America for 1960 forward. The database currently includes more than a billion individuals enumerated in 365 censuses from 94 countries around the world. IPUMS-International converts census microdata for multiple countries into a consistent format, allowing for comparisons across countries and time periods.

<text>Maria de Jesus Simões Barroso Soares, (Fuseta, 2 May 1925 – Lisbon, 7 July 2015) was a Portuguese actress, teacher and political and social activist, having been one of the founders of the Socialist Party (PS), in Germany, in 1973. As the wife of the 17th President of Portugal, Mário Soares, she was the first-lady of the country between 1986 and 1996.

== Family ==

Barroso was the daughter of military Alfredo José Barroso (Alvor, 15 April 1887 - Campo Grande, Lisbon, 14 January 1970) and Maria da Encarnação Simões, born in Coimbra, they married in Alvor in 1912. She&#x27;s the paternal granddaughter of José Barroso de Sousa and his wife Maria de Jesus Barroso and the maternal granddaughter of Manuel dos Santos and his wife Maria da Rainha Santa.

She was the paternal aunt of Alfredo Barroso and the maternal aunt of Mário Barroso, Eduardo Barroso and Graça Barroso.

== Biography ==
She came from a big family - she was the fifth of seven siblings - Maria de Jesus Barroso was there for the family&#x27;s move, from Fuseta to Setúbal and, then, from Setúbal to Lisbon. Her father, an opposer to the dictatorship, was arrested in the Lisbon Penitentiary and was deported to the Azores, where he was jailed in the Angra do Heroísmo Fort. After her primary education, that she did in Setúbal and Lisbon, she attended the secondary schools of D. Filipa de Lencastre and Pedro Nunes.

In her adolescence she gained an interest for theater and the art of spoken poetry, what led her to attend the Course of Dramatic Art in the National Conservatory Theater School. She ended her studies in 1943. She was a director and teacher of &quot;Art of Saying&quot; in the &quot;Colégio Moderno&quot;, replacing Manuel Lereno. Through the actor Assis Pacheco she enters the prestigious theater company Rey Colaço-Robles Monteiro, based in the D. Maria II National Theatre, replacing Maria Lalande. She debuted in 1944 in &quot;Aparências&quot; (Appearances), of Jacinto Benavente, directed by Palmira Bastos, and had prominent interpretation in &quot;Benilde ou a Virgem Mãe&quot; (Benilde or the Virgin Mother) of José Régio. Circa 1946, after acting in Coimbra &quot;A Casa da Bernarda Alba&quot; (The House of Bernarda Alba), of Federico García Lorca, she&#x27;s prevented from remaining in that company by interference of PIDE.

While being an actress, Barroso continued her studies in the Faculty of Arts, Lisbon, where she would obtain a degree in Historical and Philosophical Sciences, in 1951. It was in college that she met Mário Soares, whom she would marry on 22 February 1949, by proxy (but registered at the 3rd Conservatory of the Civil Register of Lisbon). Soares was then jailed for political reasons. With Soares, Barroso had two children, politician João Soares, born 1949, and psychologist Isabel Barroso Soares, born 1951, who manages the Colégio Moderno in Lisbon.

After being stopped from working in theater, Barroso would also be forbidden by the government to be a teacher. She applied for an internship for admission to teach, not having been accepted in a public school, choosing to do an internship in &quot;Colégio Moderno&quot;, ran by her father-in-law João Soares. After two years, however, her license to teach in private schools would be revoked by the National Education Ministry. She would manage the family school and only after the Carnation Revolution would she, legally, act as its director.

She would return to acting, in &quot;Antígona&quot; (1965) in the Villaret Theater, and in cinema, with the emergency of the &quot;Cinema Novo Português&quot;, acting in Paulo Soares da Rocha&#x27;s movie, &quot;Mudar de Vida&quot; (To Change Life), debuting in 1966. In the 70s and 80s she acted in Manoel de Oliveira&#x27;s movies (1985 - &quot;Le Soulier de Satin&quot;, 1979 - &quot;Amor de Perdição&quot;, 1975 - &quot;Benilde ou a Virgem Mãe&quot;).

In 1968, Barroso accompanies her husband when he is deported to São Tomé, where she is again prevented from teaching. Later, in the 70s, when the Marcello Caetano government allows Soares to exile in Paris, Barroso returns to Portugal, continuing to manage the family school.

In 1969, Barroso ran as a deputy for the CEUD (Electoral Commission of Democratic Unity), led by Mário Soares, and where Catholics and monarchists involved in the democratic opposition to the regime would insert themselves. In 1973, she participated in the III Congress of Democratic Oopposition, in Aveiro, being the only women to intervene in the opening session.

She was one of the seven people to vote against the transformation of the Portuguese Socialist Action, against the official stand of Mário Soares.

After the Carnation Revolution, Barroso was elected as a deputy of the Assembly of the Republic, successively, for Santarém, Porto, and Faro, in the legislatures started in 1976, 1979, 1980 and 1983.

Although not as politically involved as her husband, Maria Barroso was a founding member of the Socialist Party in Bad Münstereifel, Germany in 1973.

In 1986, Soares is elected President of the Republic and Barroso takes on the role of First Lady of Portugal (1986- 1996). As the First Lady, her intervention was directed towards the defense of the family sense and fighting against social exclusion and all forms of violence, participating in numerous initiatives in Portugal and other Portuguese speaking countries. In 1990, she created the Mozambique Emergency movement, granting, in the following year, the scripture of the Association for the Study and Prevention of Violence. In 1995, she presided over the opening of the cycle of realizations for the International Year of Fighting against racism, xenophobia, antisemitism and social exclusion.

After leaving the Belém Palace, in 1997, she became the president of the Portuguese Red Cross, position she held until 2003. She was also a founding partner and president of the Administration Council of ONGD, since 1994 until her death, and also presided over the Aristides Sousa Mendes Foundation.

She was awarded a &quot;Honoris Causa&quot; doctorate by the Lesley University (23 May 1994), by the University of Aveiro (16 December 1996), by the University of Lisbon (3 November 1999) and by the &quot;Universidade Lusófona&quot; in 2012. She was an honorary professor of the Society of International Studies of Madrid. And also received a Grand Cross of the Order of Liberty on 7 March 1997.

She was a member of the Portuguese National Theater Company and one of the most famous theater and cinema actresses in Portugal. In April 2000 she read the poetry of Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen at the United Nations in New York in homage to Aristides Sousa Mendes. She was involved in activities aimed at supporting the areas of culture, education and family, childhood, social solidarity, female dimension, health, the integration of the disabled and the prevention of violence.

==Illness and death==
On 25 June 2015, Maria Barroso came under medical care at Lisbon’s Red Cross Hospital after falling at home. She was transported to the hospital by her nephew Eduardo Barroso, a well-known hepato-biliary surgeon, walking in by her own foot. An initial CT scan revealed nothing serious; however, her condition worsened during the subsequent hours, and new exams revealed an extensive intracranial hemorrhage. She entered a deep coma, and Eduardo Barroso classified the situation as &quot;critical&quot; and &quot;most likely irreversible&quot;. She died in the morning of 7 July 2015.

<text>Mount Pleasant station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line, serving the town of Mount Pleasant, New York. It serves two adjacent cemeteries, Gate of Heaven and Kensico, the latter of which had its own station until the mid-1980s. There is one train in each direction on weekdays and three trains in each direction on weekends. The station exists largely to serve visitors of those buried in the cemetery, in turn there is no parking available at the station and it is not intended as a commuter station.

The station is located in the Zone 5 Metro-North fare zone.

On February 3, 2015, the Valhalla train crash occurred south of the station, in which a Metro-North train crashed into a Mercedes-Benz SUV at Commerce Street near the Taconic State Parkway. The crash caused 6 deaths and at least 15 injuries, including 7 serious injuries.

The station is the least used station on Metro-North, with only 13 passengers per week in 2018.

==Station layout==
 The station has two offset high-level side platforms, each about 50 feet long, and can fit half a car. They are accessible to only one door of a train. When trains stop here, usually the first or last car receives and discharges passengers.

<text>Manfred: A dramatic poem is a closet drama written in 1816–1817 by Lord Byron. It contains supernatural elements, in keeping with the popularity of the ghost story in England at the time. It is a typical example of Gothic fiction.

Byron commenced this work in late 1816, a few months after the famous ghost-story sessions with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley that provided the initial impetus for &quot;Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus&quot;. The supernatural references are made clear throughout the poem.

&quot;Manfred&quot; was adapted musically by Robert Schumann in 1852, in a composition entitled &quot;Manfred: Dramatic Poem with Music in Three Parts&quot;, and in 1885 by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in his &quot;Manfred Symphony&quot;. Friedrich Nietzsche was inspired by the poem&#x27;s depiction of a super-human being to compose a piano score in 1872 based on it, &quot;Manfred Meditation&quot;.

==Background==
Byron wrote this &quot;metaphysical drama&quot;, as he called it, after his marriage to Annabella Millbanke failed because of a scandal due to charges of sexual improprieties and an incestuous affair between Byron and his half-sister, Augusta Leigh. Attacked by the press and ostracised by London society, Byron fled England for Switzerland in 1816 and never returned. At the time, he was living at the Villa Diodati in Switzerland.

Because &quot;Manfred&quot; was written immediately after this, and because it regards a main character tortured by his own sense of guilt for an unmentionable offence, some critics consider it to be autobiographical, or even confessional. The unnamed, but forbidden, nature of Manfred&#x27;s relationship to Astarte is believed to represent Byron&#x27;s relationship with his half-sister Augusta.

Most of &quot;Manfred&quot; was written on a tour through the Bernese Alps in September 1816. The third act was rewritten in February 1817, since Byron was not happy with its first version.

==Plot==
Manfred is a Faustian noble living in the Bernese Alps. Internally tortured by some mysterious guilt, which has to do with the death of his most beloved, Astarte, he uses his mastery of language and spell-casting to summon seven spirits, from whom he seeks forgetfulness. The spirits, who rule the various components of the corporeal world, are unable to control past events and thus cannot grant Manfred&#x27;s plea. For some time, fate prevents him from escaping his guilt through suicide.

At the end, Manfred dies, defying religious temptations of redemption from sin. Throughout the poem he succeeds in challenging all of the authoritative powers he faces, and chooses death over submitting to the powerful spirits. Manfred directs his final words to the Abbot, remarking, &quot;Old man! &#x27;tis not so difficult to die&quot;. &quot;The unconquerable individual to the end, Manfred gives his soul to neither heaven nor hell, only to death.&quot;

==Critique==
Published in June 1817, &quot;Manfred&quot; has as its epigraph the famous saying from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;: &quot;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.&quot; It seems to be strongly influenced by Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, which Byron probably read in translation (although he claimed never to have read it).

In September 1817, John Neal accused Byron of &quot;egotism, contradiction, and affection&quot; in authoring &quot;Manfred&quot;, claiming that &quot;Byron was made for crime, not vice.&quot; Aside from pointing out the poem&#x27;s absurdities, Neal nevertheless offered high praise and claimed of one verse that &quot;our language does not furnish a more delicate, beautiful, mellow, and quiet picture.&quot;

&quot;Manfred&quot; has as its theme defiant humanism, represented by the hero’s refusal to bow to supernatural authority. Peter L. Thorslev Jr. notes that Manfred conceals behind a Gothic exterior the tender heart of the Hero of Sensibility; but as a rebel, like Satan, Cain, and Prometheus, he embodies Romantic self-assertion.

==Characters==
==In performance==
&quot;Manfred&quot; was not originally intended for stage performance; it was written to be a dramatic poem or, as Byron called it, a &quot;metaphysical&quot; drama. It has received much more attention on stage for its musical treatments by Tchaikovsky and Schumann than it has on its own dramatic terms. Nevertheless, &quot;Manfred&quot; was later famously played by Samuel Phelps.

There are no recorded full stagings in Britain in the twentieth century, but readings are more popular, partly because of the difficulty of staging a play set in the Alps, partly because of the work&#x27;s nature as a closet drama that was never actually intended for the stage in the first place. The exceptional size of the role of Manfred also makes the play difficult to cast. There was a production on BBC Radio 3 in 1988, however, which starred Ronald Pickup as Manfred. A new production, adapted and directed by Pauline Harris with original music composed and performed by Olly Fox and starring Joseph Millson as Manfred, was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 8 January 2017 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of &quot;Manfred&quot;″s completion.

==Manfred in literature==
The character Manfred was mentioned by Alexandre Dumas, &quot;père&quot; in his novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, where the Count declares: &quot;No, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting Manfred. I wish my life to be free and open.&quot; Indeed, the Count of Monte Cristo is quite similar to Manfred, in that he wants to keep his past a secret, feels superior to social conventions, and is following an agenda that runs counter to the social mores.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky mentions the poem in &quot;Notes from Underground&quot; when the narrator states, &quot;I received countless millions and immediately gave them away for the benefit of humanity, at the same moment confessing before the crowd all my infamies, which, of course, were not mere infamies, but also contained within them a wealth of &#x27;the lofty and the beautiful&#x27; of something Manfred-like&quot; (Dostoyevsky, page 57. Bantam Books 2005)

Herman Melville references the poem twice in &quot;Mardi&quot; (1849): in Chapter 4 describing being up in the foremast-head: &quot;Now this standing upon a bit of stick 100 feet aloft for hours at a time, swiftly sailing over the sea, is very much like crossing the Channel in a balloon. Manfred-like, you talk to the clouds: you have a fellow feeling for the sun.&quot;; and in Chapter 11 wondering at a character&#x27;s gravity: &quot;It was inconceivable, that his reveries were Manfred-like and exalted, reminiscent of unutterable deeds, too mysterious even to be indicated by the remotest of hints.&quot; The whale-boat used to escape in the beginning is named &quot;Chamois,&quot; referring explicitly to the goat-antelope creature, and likely also alluding to the hunter in Manfred.

In Act II of &quot;Ivanov (play)&quot; by Anton Chekhov, Ivanov compares himself to Manfred, saying: “I could die of shame at the thought that I, a healthy, strong man, have turned into some sort of Hamlet, or Manfred, or superfluous man—God only knows what! (Chekhov 40)” (Chekhov, Anton. The Major Plays. 1964. Translated by Ann Dunnigan, Signet Classics, 2006.)

On page 61 of &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; by Thomas Pynchon, Di Presso seems to refer (perhaps by accident) to Metzger as Manfred.

Manfred&#x27;s oft-quoted speech from Act II Scene 1 which begins &quot;Think&#x27;st thou existence doth depend on time?&quot; is quoted on page 351 of &quot;The Masters of Solitude&quot; by Marvin Kaye and Parke Godwin.

&quot;In Memory of My Feelings&quot;, the poem by Frank O&#x27;Hara, includes the line &quot;Manfred climbs to my nape,/ speaks, but I do not hear him,/ I&#x27;m too blue.&quot;

In &quot;Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell&quot; by Susanna Clarke, Byron is said to have written &quot;Manfred&quot; after meeting the magician Jonathan Strange and finding him most disagreeable. It is suggested that he wrote it because he was so disappointed with Strange that he created a magician more to his liking.

The final scene of &quot;Daisy Miller&quot; by Henry James is set in the Colosseum of Rome. James mentions that, before entering the Colosseum, his protagonist Winterbourne loudly quotes Manfred&#x27;s monologue on the Colosseum (Act III, Scene IV).

==Other references to &quot;Manfred&quot;==
In the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera &quot;Patience,&quot; Manfred is referenced in Colonel Calverley&#x27;s patter song &quot;If you want a receipt for that popular mystery&quot; (A Heavy Dragoon), listing one ingredient as &quot;a little of Manfred but not very much of him&quot;.

German gothic metal band The Vision Bleak extensively quote from &quot;Manfred&quot; in their song &quot;A Curse of the Grandest Kind&quot;, on their 2010 album &quot;Set Sail to Mystery&quot;

Big Finish&#x27;s &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; references the tale in an audio production, &quot;Dress Me in Dark Dreams&quot;. Edith Collins seeks to re-read the poem after some lines are stuck in her head.

Christopher Tin and Shoji Kameda (as &quot;Stereo Alchemy &quot;) used the text of &quot;Manfred&quot; as the basis for the lyrics to &quot;Monster of the Sky&quot; on their album &quot;God of Love&quot;

Manfred Township, Minnesota is named after &quot;Manfred&quot;

<text>HMS &quot;Hedingham Castle&quot; was a of the Royal Navy named after Hedingham Castle in Essex.

She was originally to have been called &quot;Gorey Castle&quot; (after Mont Orgueil in Jersey). She was launched at John Crown &amp; Sons Ltd in Sunderland on 30 October 1944. In World War II she served as a convoy escort.

In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and was broken up at Granton in April 1958.

Another Castle-class corvette was originally to have been called &quot;Hedingham Castle&quot; but she was reallocated to the Royal Canadian Navy before launching and renamed .

She plays in the film &quot;Seagulls Over Sorrento&quot; (also called &quot;Crest of the Wave&quot;) (Roy Boulting – 1954).

<doc id="1246630" wikidata="Q640068" url="?curid=1246630" title="Phytochemistry">
<text>Phytochemistry is the study of phytochemicals, which are chemicals derived from plants. Phytochemists strive to describe the structures of the large number of secondary metabolites found in plants, the functions of these compounds in human and plant biology, and the biosynthesis of these compounds. Plants synthesize phytochemicals for many reasons, including to protect themselves against insect attacks and plant diseases. The compounds found in plants are of many kinds, but most can be grouped into four major biosynthetic classes: alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, polyketides, and terpenoids.

Phytochemistry can be considered a subfield of botany or chemistry. Activities can be led in botanical gardens or in the wild with the aid of ethnobotany. Phytochemical studies directed toward human (i.e. drug discovery) use may fall under the discipline of pharmacognosy, whereas phytochemical studies focused on the ecological functions and evolution of phytochemicals likely fall under the discipline of chemical ecology. Phytochemistry also has relevance to the field of plant physiology.

== Techniques ==
Techniques commonly used in the field of phytochemistry are extraction, isolation, and structural elucidation (MS,1D and 2D NMR) of natural products, as well as various chromatography techniques (MPLC, HPLC, and LC-MS).

== Phytochemicals ==

Many plants produce chemical compounds for defence against herbivores. The major classes of pharmacologically active phytochemicals are described below, with examples of medicinal plants that contain them. Human settlements are often surrounded by weeds containing phytochemicals, such as nettle, dandelion and chickweed.

Many phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein, and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds and are not useful in drug discovery.

===Alkaloids===
Alkaloids are bitter-tasting chemicals, widespread in nature, and often toxic. There are several classes with different modes of action as drugs, both recreational and pharmaceutical. Medicines of different classes include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine (all from nightshade), the traditional medicine berberine (from plants such as &quot;Berberis&quot; and &quot;Mahonia&quot;), caffeine (&quot;Coffea&quot;), cocaine (&quot;Coca&quot;), ephedrine (&quot;Ephedra&quot;), morphine (opium poppy), nicotine (tobacco), reserpine (&quot;Rauvolfia serpentina&quot;), quinidine and quinine (&quot;Cinchona&quot;), vincamine (&quot;Vinca minor&quot;), and vincristine (&quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot;).

===Glycosides===
Anthraquinone glycosides are found in senna, rhubarb, and &quot;Aloe&quot;.

The cardiac glycosides are phytochemicals from plants including foxglove and lily of the valley. They include digoxin and digitoxin which act as diuretics.

===Polyphenols===
Polyphenols of several classes are widespread in plants, including anthocyanins, phytoestrogens, and tannins. Polyphenols are secondary metabolites produced by almost every part of plants, including fruits, flowers, leaves and bark.

===Terpenes===
Terpenes and terpenoids of many kinds are found in resinous plants such as the conifers. They are aromatic and serve to repel herbivores. Their scent makes them useful in essential oils, whether for perfumes such as rose and lavender, or for aromatherapy. Some have had medicinal uses: thymol is an antiseptic and was once used as a vermifuge (anti-worm medicine).

==Genetics==
Contrary to bacteria and fungi, most plant metabolic pathways are not grouped into biosynthetic gene clusters, but instead are scattered as individual genes. Some exceptions have been discovered: steroidal glycoalkaloids in &quot;Solanum&quot;, polyketides in Pooideae, benzoxazinoids in &quot;Zea mays&quot;, triterpenes in &quot;Avena sativa&quot;, Cucurbitaceae, &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, and momilactone diterpenes in &quot;Oryza sativa&quot;.

<doc id="1246637" wikidata="Q121957" url="?curid=1246637" title="Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko">
<text>Prince Jan Duklan Maurycy Paweł Puzyna de Kosielsko (13 September 1842 – 8 September 1911) was a Polish Roman Catholic Cardinal who was auxiliary bishop of Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine) from 1886 to 1895, and the bishop of Kraków from 1895 until his death in 1911. Named a Cardinal in 1901, he was known for his conservative views and authoritarianism.

==Biography==
Puzyna was born in 1842 in what was then a part of the Austrian Empire and former part of the Kingdom of Poland, in the diocese of Lwów. He earned a doctorate in law from the University of Lwów on 24 June 1870. He began a career in civil administration, but decided to embrace an ecclesiastical career. Ordained a priest on 1 December 1878, he was a vicar (assistant pastor) at Przeworsk, and then became a Canon of the Cathedral of Przemyśl. He was named auxiliary bishop of the Latin-rite Archbishop of Lwów and titular bishop of Memphis on 26 February 1886. He was consecrated a bishop on 25 March of that same year by Mieczysław Halka-Ledóchowski, with Archbishop Franziskus von Paula Graf von Schönborn of Prague and Archbishop Joseph Sembratovych of Ukrainian rite Lwów. He was translated to the Archdiocese of Kraków on 22 January 1895.

On 15 April 1901, Puzyna was created a cardinal-priest, with the title of Santi Vitale, Valeria, Gervasio e Protasio by Pope Leo XIII. He received his red hat on 9 June 1902.

During the conclave of 1903, acting on behalf of his Sovereign, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, he presented a veto against the election of Cardinal Mariano Rampolla. Puzyna wanted to avoid the election of Rampolla, who was sympathetic to Russia and Germany. Among other things, Rampolla sought to curry favor with Russia by abolishing the Polish language and instituting Russian in the Russian partition&#x27;s Catholic churches. These were ethnic and linguistic considerations.

Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, too, did not wish to see Rampolla elected to the Chair of Peter. He held a grudge against Rampolla for opposing a proper burial for his son Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, upon Rudolf&#x27;s suicide. Rampolla also openly supported political forces in Austria that were hostile to the Emperor. The Emperor therefore authorized the Cardinal to present the veto in his name. 

On his way to the conclave, Puzyna met in Vienna with the Emperor and proposed that the Emperor present his veto, &quot;jus exclusivae&quot;, against Cardinal Rampolla. The Emperor subscribed to the idea, and Puzyna presented the veto on the third day of the conclave, in the name of His Apostolic Majesty Francis Joseph, Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary. When the veto was read, Cardinal Luigi Oreglia di Santo Stefano, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, replied, &quot;This communication cannot be received officially or unofficially. No cardinal is to give any consideration to this &#x27;veto&#x27; and all are to continue to vote according to their conscience.&quot; In other words, the attempt at a veto was rejected. It was the last time such a veto was used. The veto, although not recognized by canon law, and as such non-binding, still carried much political weight, as the cardinals feared opposing the manifest will of one of the Christian monarchs. 

The veto, once conceded by tradition to the Emperor, the King of France and the King of Spain, was abolished by the newly elected Pope Pius X, who imposed the penalty of excommunication upon anyone who would dare to introduce a veto, or otherwise interfere in the election of the Roman Pontiff. Pope Pius X further decreed that all cardinals should take an oath at the beginning of the conclave, promising not to aid any civil power in an attempt to influence the election of the pope.

Puzyna was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary in 1904. He was a member of the Sacred Congregation Consistorial, the SC of Bishops and Regulars, the SC of the Index, the SC of Indulgences and Relics, and the SC of Studies.

Jan Cardinal Puzyna de Kosielsko died in Kraków in 1911, five days before his 69th birthday.

<text>Vítor Manuel Ribeiro Constâncio (born 12 October 1943) is a Portuguese economist and academic who most recently served as Vice President of the European Central Bank, from 2010 to 2018. He previously served as Minister of Finance in 1978 and Governor of the Bank of Portugal from 1985 to 1986 and from 2000 to 2010.

Since June 2018 he has been a professor at the School of Economics &amp; Business Administration of the University of Navarra.

==Education==
Constâncio graduated in economics from the Technical University of Lisbon (now called the University of Lisbon) in 1965 and obtained a master&#x27;s degree at the University of Bristol in 1973-1974. 

==Career==
===Academic career and national public office===
Constâncio was Assistant Professor in Economics at the Technical University of Lisbon from 1965 to 1973.

From 1974 to 1975, he was Secretary of State for Planning in the I and II Provisional Government of Portugal, and Secretary of State for Budget and Planning in 1976 in the IV Provisional Government. This was directly in the wake of the Carnation Revolution. He then became Minister of Finance from January to August 1978 in the II Constitutional Government of Portugal, and is therefore until now the youngest Portuguese Finance Minister since the revolution. In 1980-1981, he was a professor at the Portuguese Catholic University.

Constâncio was secretary-general of the Socialist Party from 1986 to 1989. He lost the legislative elections of 19 July 1987, but remained in office. He resigned the following year, being replaced by Jorge Sampaio. 

Constâncio was governor of the Banco de Portugal, the Portuguese central bank, for the first time in 1985–86, having been appointed vice-governor in 1977, in 1979, and in the period from 1981 to 1984.

From 1993 to 1994, Constâncio served as chairman of Lisboa 94, the entity in charge of organizing the commemorative events of Lisbon as European Capital of Culture.

Between 1995 and 1999, Constâncio was a member of the Portuguese Council of State. During the same period, he served as Member of the Board (Executive Director) of Banco Português de Investimento (BPI), a leading private Portuguese banking group, with responsibility for Budget, Accounting and Control of Financial Market Risks. In this capacity, he represented BPI as non-executive member of the board of Portugal Telecom and subsequently as non-executive member of the Board of Energias de Portugal.

Constâncio served once more as governor of the Banco de Portugal from 2000 to 2010, having been re-appointed in 2006. Under his presidency the Bank of Portugal spent one third of its original holdings of 600 tons of gold to 400 tons, approximately.

While in office, he advocated salaries stagnation or increases below inflation, as a way to increase the Portuguese economy&#x27;s competitiveness. In 2005, Constâncio enraged right-wing politicians when he reviewed the previous conservative government&#x27;s figures and revised the deficit up from around 3% to 6.8%. Two Portuguese banks (Banco Português de Negócios (BPN) and Banco Privado Português (BPP)) had been accumulating losses for years due to bad investments, embezzlement and accounting fraud. The Portuguese Central Bank, led by Constâncio, was criticized for having allowed this situation for years.

===European Central Bank, 2010–2018===
Constâncio was first mentioned as a potential vice president of the European Central Bank in 2002, to replace Christian Noyer. At the time, he cited family reasons for refusing to run for the post.

Constâncio was eventually appointed vice president of European Central Bank in 2010, for an eight-year mandate. At the time, he was chosen by Eurozone finance ministers ahead of Peter Praet, director of the National Bank of Belgium, and Yves Mersch, the governor of the Bank of Luxembourg, to replace Lucas Papademos of Greece. During his time at the ECB, he developed a reputation as an inflation dove who often emphasised the need for economic growth.

Shortly after, on 6 April 2011, the Portuguese Government, facing increasing difficulties in securing its financing needs in the international financial markets, formally requested international financial assistance leading to a €78 billion program with equal participation of the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, European Financial Stability Facility and International Monetary Fund.

In June 2018, at the end of his term of office, he was replaced as ECB vice president by Luis de Guindos.

===Post European Central Bank===
Since June 2018 he has been a professor at the School of Economics &amp; Business Administration of the University of Navarra.

== Personal life ==
In 1968 he married Maria José Pardana. They have one son and one daughter.

<text>Maxima Caesariensis (Latin for &quot;The Caesarian province of Maximus&quot;), also known as Britannia Maxima, was one of the provinces of the Diocese of &quot;the Britains&quot; created during the Diocletian Reforms at the end of the 3rd century. It was probably created after the defeat of the usurper Allectus by Constantius Chlorus in AD 296 and was mentioned in the Verona List of the Roman provinces. Its position and capital remain uncertain, although it was probably adjacent to Flavia Caesariensis. On the basis of its governor&#x27;s eventual consular rank, it is now usually considered to have consisted of Augusta or Londinium (London) and southeastern England.


==History==
Following the Roman conquest of Britain, Britain was administered as a single province from Camulodunum (Colchester) and then Londinium (London) until the Severan Reforms following the revolt of its governor Clodius Albinus. These divided the territory into Upper and Lower Britain (&quot;Britannia Superior&quot; and &quot;Inferior&quot;), whose respective capitals were at Londinium and Eboracum (York). During the first phases of the Diocletian Reforms, Britain was under the control of the Allectus&#x27;s Britannic Empire as part of the Carausian Revolt. At some point after the territory was retaken by Constantius Chlorus in AD 296, the Diocese of the Britains (with its vicar at Londinium) was formed and made a part of Prefecture of Gaul. The Britains were divided among three, four, or five provinces, which seem to have borne the names Prima, Secunda, Maxima Caesariensis, and (possibly) Flavia Caesariensis and Valentia.

The placement and capitals of these late British provinces are uncertain, although the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; lists the governor of Maxima (originally an equestrian &quot;praeses&quot;) as having been elevated to consular rank. Scholars usually associate this with the administration at Londinium, which was also the capital of the diocesan vicar.

Describing the metropolitan sees of the early British church established by SS Fagan and &quot;Duvian&quot;, Gerald of Wales placed &quot;Maximia&quot; in Eboracum (York) and Londinium in Flavia, saying the former was named for the emperor Maximus. William Camden followed him and this placement was generally accepted after the appearance of Charles Bertram&#x27;s highly-influential 1740s forgery &quot;The Description of Britain&quot;, which gave Maxima borders from the Humber and Mersey to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall; this work was debunked over the course of the mid-19th century.

Modern scholars are uncertain whether the province was named for the western senior emperor Valerius Maximian or the eastern junior emperor Galerius Maximian. Birley has argued that Maxima and Flavia originally consisted of a single province, which received the name &quot;Britannia Caesariensis&quot; as a mark of favour for support against the rebel Allectus in 296. Although Flavia is usually thought to have been formed from the old province of Lower Britain, Birley proposes that Upper Britain was divided in two (between Prima and Caesariensis) and then three (Prima, Maxima, and Flavia). This repeats Camden&#x27;s earlier theory (relying on Sextus Rufus) that Maxima was formed first and Flavia followed sometime after.

<doc id="1246647" wikidata="Q425767" url="?curid=1246647" title="White Carniola">
<text>White Carniola (; ; or &quot;Weiße Mark&quot;) is a traditional region in southeastern Slovenia on the border with Croatia. Due to its smallness, it is often considered a subunit of the broader Lower Carniola region, although with distinctive cultural, linguistic, and historical features.

Due to its proximity with Croatia, White Carniola shares many cultural and linguistic features with the neighboring Kajkavian Croatian areas. It is generally considered the Slovenian region with the closest cultural affinity with other South Slavic territories. It was part of Slavonia until the 12th century, after which it shared the historical fate with the Windic March and Lower Carniola to the north. During the 19th century, it was one of the regions with the highest emigration rate in the Slovene Lands, and the Austrian Empire in general. During World War II, it was an important center of anti-Fascist resistance in Slovenia.

==Geography==
The area is confined by the Gorjanci and Kočevski Rog mountain ranges in the north and west and the Kolpa River in the south and east, which also forms part of the border between Slovenia and Croatia. As the area could only be reached from northern Lower Carniola by mountain passes, the inhabitants cultivate a certain distinctness.

The region corresponds to the present-day municipalities of Metlika, Črnomelj and Semič. The terrain is characterised by low karst hills and extensive birch forests. The main river is the Kolpa with its Lahinja, Dobličica and Krupa tributaries.

White Carniola is known for Grič and Kanižarica pottery from clay with a distinct calcite content, as well as for high-quality wines, such as &quot;metliška črnina&quot; (a dark red wine), &quot;belokranjec&quot; (a white wine), and &quot;modra frankinja&quot; (i.e. Blaufränkisch).
== Tradition ==
A distinguishing part of White Carniola is its folk heritage. It still has many folklore events, which show traditional local costumes, music, played on a regionally known instrument called tamburica, and a circle dance, called &quot;belokranjsko kolo&quot;. A distinctive feature is also the &quot;pisanica&quot;, a coloured Easter egg decorated in a characteristic manner using beeswax that is found nowhere else in Slovenia. &quot;Belokranjska pogača&quot; (White Carniola flatbread) has recently been granted the European Union&#x27;s Traditional Speciality Guaranteed designation.

==Name==
The name &quot;Bela krajina&quot; literally means &#x27;White March&#x27;. The noun &quot;krajina&quot; or &#x27;march&#x27; refers to a border territory organized for military defense. The adjective &quot;bela&quot; &#x27;white&#x27; may refer to the deciduous trees (especially birch trees) in the area in comparison to &quot;black&quot; (i.e. coniferous) trees in the neighboring Kočevje area. It may also be an old designation for &#x27;west&#x27;, referring to the western location of the region in comparison to the Croatian Military Frontier (). Non-linguistic explanations connect the designation &quot;bela&quot; with the traditional white linen clothing of the population. The names &quot;Bela krajina&quot; and &quot;Belokranjci&quot; (explained in relation to white clothing) first emerged in the first half of the 19th century as the area was earlier (from at least the 13th century) known as &quot;Metlika&quot;. The English name &quot;White Carniola&quot; derives from the German designation &quot;Weißkrain&quot;, which is the result of a hypercorrection based on the adjective &quot;belokrajnski&quot; (understood as a dialect metathesis of *&quot;belokranjski&quot;) (cf. also German &quot;Dürrenkrain&quot;, English: &quot;Dry Carniola&quot;, for Slovene &quot;Suha krajina&quot;, literally &#x27;dry region&#x27;).

==History==
===Middle Ages===
In the early 12th century, the area was part of the disputed border region between the March of Carniola, established by the Holy Roman Empire in the northwest, and the Kingdom of Hungary in the east and southeast. From about 1127 the local counts of Višnja Gora (Weichselberg) backed by the Spanheim margraves and the Salzburg archbishops crossed the Gorjanci Mountains and marched against the Hungarian and Croatian forces, which they pushed beyond the Kolpa River down to Bregana.

The Counts of Weichselberg, who traced their lineage to Saint Hemma of Gurk, established their residence at Metlika (Möttling), and therefore in contemporary sources their lands were also referred to as the County of Möttling (Metlika). After the line became extinct in 1209, the possessions passed to the Carniolan margraves from the House of Andechs, the self-styled Dukes of Merania. In 1229, the area was passed as a dowry of Agnes of Merania to Frederick II of Austria, the last Babenberg ruler, and after his death to Agnes&#x27;s second husband Ulrich of Spanheim, lord of Carniola and duke of Carinthia. After Ulrich&#x27;s death in 1269, all of his possessions were inherited by his cousin Ottokar II of Bohemia, who was however defeated by Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf of Habsburg and his allies in 1278. Rudolf gave the County of Metlika as a fief to his ally Albert I of Gorizia, together with the eastern portion of the neighboring Windic March. Under his descendant Albert III of Gorizia, these two adjacent areas were united in what became known as the &quot;County in the (Windic) March and in Metlika&quot;, and became officially a separate estate of the Holy Roman Empire in 1368. After Albert&#x27;s death in 1374, the county was acquired by Archduke Rudolf IV of Austria for the House of Habsburg, who confirmed its privileges, thus maintaining it separate from the Duchy of Carniola. The county was soon leased out to the House of Celje, which acquired full rights of the lords of the land in 1443. It remained part of the Celje domains until their extinction in 1457, whereafter it reverted to the Habsburgs, who gradually incorporated it into Carniola.

===Early modern period===
With the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, groups of Serbs and Croats fled to the north or west; of the western migrational groups, some settled in White Carniola and Žumberak. Vlachs and Uskoks, including both ethnic Croats and Serbs, came to White Carniola and Žumberak from Croatia and Bosnia. The Habsburg commanders brought from Bosnia, later and from parts of Croatia and Dalmatia hundreds or thousands of families and settled them in area which covers White Carniola, across the Žumberak Mountains all the way to Vinica. In September 1597, with the fall of Slatina, some 1,700 Uskoks with their wives and children settled in Carniola, bringing some 4,000 sheep with them. The following year, with the conquest of Cernik, some 500 Uskok families settled in Carniola.

In his 1689 work &quot;The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola&quot;, the historian Johann Weikhard von Valvasor described the language, clothing, and customs of the people of White Carniola region as Croatian. The self-identification of students on the university registers in Graz and Vienna between 1643 and 1712 shows that as many as 88% of students from White Carniola identified as Croats, and only 12% as Carniolans. The provincial designation &#x27;Croats&#x27; (&quot;Crovathen/Crobathen&quot;) was used for White Carniola in 1709, and the name &#x27;Croats&#x27; for the inhabitants of White Carniola is found in 1725 in a report by a doctor named Zalokar from Novo Mesto. The dialect of the parish of Vinica in far southern White Carniola was marked as Croatian in 1795.

==Buildings==
===Castles===

Several castles were built in the border region, especially during the Ottoman Wars from the 15th century onwards, as in Črnomelj, Gradac and Vinica. The remains of the large fortress in Pobrežje were destroyed in World War II.

==Culture==
Based on surnames found in White Carniola, it may be concluded that their ancestors were Serbs and Croats. In old folk poetry of White Carniola, Serbian hero Prince Marko is often mentioned, sung in &quot;clean Shtokavian&quot;. A small Serb community exists in White Carniola.

<doc id="1246649" wikidata="Q318750" url="?curid=1246649" title="Stephen Hillenburg">
<text>Stephen McDannell Hillenburg (August 21, 1961 – November 26, 2018) was an American animator, voice actor, and marine biology educator. Hillenburg was best known for creating the animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; for Nickelodeon in 1999. Serving as the showrunner for its first three seasons, and again from season nine until his death, the show has become the fifth-longest-running American animated series. He also provided the original voice of Patchy the Pirate&#x27;s pet, Potty the Parrot.

Born in Lawton, Oklahoma and raised in Anaheim, California, Hillenburg became fascinated with the ocean as a child and developed an interest in art. He started his professional career in 1984, instructing marine biology at the Orange County Marine Institute, where he wrote and illustrated &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot;, an informative picture book about tide-pool animals, which he used to educate his students. After two years of teaching, he enrolled at California Institute of the Arts in 1989 to pursue a career in animation. He was later offered a job on the Nickelodeon animated television series &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; (19931996) following the success of his 1992 short films &quot;The Green Beret&quot; and &quot;Wormholes&quot;, which were made as part of his studies.

In 1994, Hillenburg began developing &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot; characters and concepts for what became &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, which has aired continuously since 1999. He also directed &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; (2004), which he originally intended to be the series finale. He then resigned as showrunner, but remained credited as executive producer on subsequent seasons (even after his death). He later resumed creating short films with &quot;Hollywood Blvd., USA&quot; (2013). He co-wrote the story for the second film adaptation of the series, &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot; (2015), and received a posthumous executive producer credit for the third film, &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot; (2020).

Besides his two Emmy Awards and six Annie Awards for &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, Hillenburg also received other recognitions, such as an accolade from Heal the Bay for his efforts in elevating marine life awareness and the Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society. Hillenburg announced he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2017, but stated he would continue working on &quot;SpongeBob&quot; for as long as possible. He died from the disease on November 26, 2018, at the age of 57.

==Early life and education==
Stephen McDannell Hillenburg was born on August21, 1961 at Fort Sill, a United States Army post in Lawton, Oklahoma, where his father, Kelly N. Hillenburg Jr. (1936–2006), worked for the U.S. military and was a Methodist. His mother, Nancy (née Dufour), taught visually impaired students and came from a Methodist family. When he was a year old, the family moved to Orange County, California, where his father began a career as a draftsman and designer in the aerospace industry. His younger brother, Bryan, eventually became a draftsman/designer as well.

When an interviewer asked Hillenburg to describe himself as a child, he replied that he was &quot;probably well-meaning and naive like all kids.&quot; His passion for sea life can be traced to his childhood, when films by Jacques Cousteau, a French oceanographer, made a strong impression on him. Hillenburg said that Cousteau &quot;provided a view into that world&quot;, which he had not known existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that &quot;should have been left there and that ended up dying and smelling really bad.&quot;

Hillenburg also developed his interest in art at a young age. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration which he drew in third grade, depicting &quot;a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting&quot;, brought him the first praise for his artwork, when his teacher commended it. &quot;Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that was in the middle of [the Vietnam War]. She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, &#x27;oh my gosh, look at that&#x27;&quot;, Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew he &quot;had some [creative] skill&quot;. He asserted that his artistry came from his mother&#x27;s side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was &quot;really, really gifted&quot; and a &quot;great painter&quot;. In the 1970s, someone took Hillenburg to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He was &quot;knocked out&quot; by the foreign animated films, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen&#x27;s &quot;The Killing of an Egg&quot; (1977). &quot;That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on,&quot; he recounted.
He attended Savanna High School in Anaheim, describing himself as a &quot;band geek&quot; who played the trumpet. At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time; Hillenburg took part in a &quot;dive program&quot; at Woods Coves in Laguna Beach, as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna. This experience, as well as subsequent dives, reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college: &quot;The switch clicked and I decided I wanted to be a marine biologist, but I also liked being an artist.&quot; Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise, saying: &quot;You should just draw fish.&quot; However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by &quot;making weird, little paintings&quot;. During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler at a fast-food seafood restaurant in Maine. (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants&#x27;s occupation in the television series.)

Hillenburg went to Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, as a marine-science major. He minored in art, and said that &quot;[he] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt.&quot; In 1984, he earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in natural-resource planning and interpretation, with an emphasis on marine resources. He intended to take a master&#x27;s degree, but said it would be in art: &quot;Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art.&quot;

==Early career==

After graduating from college, Hillenburg held various jobs in 1984, including as a park service attendant in Utah and an art director in San Francisco, before landing the job he wanted: teaching children. He hoped to work in a national park on the coast, and eventually found a job at the Orange County Marine Institute (now the Ocean Institute), an organization in Dana Point, California, dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history. Hillenburg was a marine biology teacher there for three years: &quot;We taught tide-pool ecology, nautical history, diversity and adaptation. Working there, I saw how enamored kids are with undersea life, especially with tide-pool creatures.&quot; He stayed at the Dana Point Marina and was also a staff artist. Although &quot;[i]t was a great experience&quot; for him, he realized he was more interested in art than his chosen profession.

While working there, one of the educational directors asked him if he would be interested in creating an educational comic book about the animal life of tidal pools. He created a comic called &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot;, which he used to teach his students. It featured anthropomorphic forms of sea life, many of which would evolve into &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; charactersincluding &quot;Bob the Sponge&quot;, the comic&#x27;s co-host, who resembled a realistic sea sponge, as opposed to his later SpongeBob SquarePants character, a sea sponge whose stylized square shape resembles a kitchen sponge. He tried to get the comic published, but the publishers he approached turned him down.

During this time, Hillenburg also started attending animation festivals such as the International Tournée of Animation and Spike and Mike&#x27;s Festival of Animation, where student films from the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts) were shown. He determined that he wanted to pursue a career in that field. He had planned to take a master&#x27;s degree in art, but instead of &quot;going back to school for painting&quot;, he left his job in 1987 to become an animator.

Hillenburg enrolled in CalArts&#x27;s Experimental Animation Program in 1989. About this decision, he said: &quot;Changing careers like that is scary, but the irony is that animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle.&quot; He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considered his &quot;Art Dad&quot; and mentor. Impressed by &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot;, Engel accepted him into the program. Hillenburg said, &quot;[Engel] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, &#x27;Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.&#x27; I don&#x27;t have any [prior experience in] animation really.&quot; Hillenburg graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation. During his time at CalArts, he briefly drew comics for the surfing magazine &quot;KEMA&quot; in 1990.

==Animation career==
===Early works===

Hillenburg made his first animated works, short films &quot;The Green Beret&quot; (1991) and &quot;Wormholes&quot; (1992), while at CalArts. &quot;The Green Beret&quot; was about a physically challenged Girl Scout with enormous fists who toppled houses and destroyed neighborhoods while trying to sell Girl Scout cookies. &quot;Wormholes&quot; was his seven-minute thesis film, about the theory of relativity. He described the latter as &quot;a poetic animated film based on relativistic phenomena&quot; in his grant proposal in 1991 to the Princess Grace Foundation, which assists emerging artists in American theater, dance, and film. The foundation agreed to fund the effort, providing Hillenburg with a Graduate Film Scholarship. &quot;It meant a lot,&quot; he said in 2003. &quot;They funded one of the projects I&#x27;m most proud of, even with &quot;SpongeBob&quot;. It provided me the opportunity just to make a film that was personal, and what I would call independent, and free of some of the commercial needs.&quot; &quot;Wormholes&quot; was shown at several international animation festivals, including the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, the Hiroshima International Animation Festival, the Los Angeles International Animation Celebration, the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, and the Ottawa International Animation Festival, where it won Best Concept. &quot;LA Weekly&quot; called the film &quot;road-trippy&quot; and &quot;&quot;Zap&quot;-comical&quot;, while Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;inventive&quot;.

Hillenburg explained that &quot;anything goes&quot; in experimental animation. Although this allowed him to explore alternatives to conventional methods of filmmaking, he still ventured to employ &quot;an industry style&quot;; he preferred to traditionally animate his films (where each frame is drawn by hand) rather than, for instance, make cartoons &quot;by filming piles of sand changing&quot;. He made at least one other short film as an animation student, but its title is unspecified.

===&quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;===
Hillenburg&#x27;s first professional job in the animation business was as a director on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; (19931996), Nickelodeon&#x27;s first in-house cartoon production. He &quot;ended up finding work in the industry and got a job&quot; at the television network after he met the show&#x27;s creator, Joe Murray, at the 1992 Ottawa International Animation Festival, where &quot;Wormholes&quot; and Murray&#x27;s &quot;My Dog Zero&quot; were both in competition. Murray, who was looking for people to direct &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; at the time, saw Hillenburg&#x27;s film and offered him a directorial role on the television series. He &quot;[had] friends that [gave him] a hard time about [the offer]. ... but doors opened when [he] stepped into the animation world,&quot; so he accepted it. He &quot;was planning on being a starving artist&quot;: &quot;[I spent] several thousand dollars to make a film and [realized] I may not make it backI had loans out. Fortunately, Joe Murray saw my film... and he took a huge chance,&quot; Hillenburg related.

Hillenburg worked closely with Murray on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; for its whole run on the air. Aside from directing, he also produced, wrote and storyboarded for some episodes, and served as the executive story editor. In particular, the third season episode &quot;Fish-N-Chumps&quot; was co-written and directed by Hillenburg, and involved Rocko, Heffer, and Filburt going on a fishing trip, oblivious to the fact that a pair of anthropomorphic sea creatures are attempting to catch them from underwater; this would foreshadow his later work with &quot;SpongeBob&quot;. In 1995, during the fourth and final season of &quot;Rocko&quot;, Hillenburg was promoted to creative director, where he helped oversee pre- and post-production. Working on the series enabled him to repay his loans. He later related that he &quot;learned a great deal about writing and producing animation for TV&quot; from his stint on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;.

===&quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;===
====Creation====
Some evidence shows that the idea for &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; dates back to 1986, during Hillenburg&#x27;s time at the Orange County Marine Institute. He indicated that children&#x27;s television series such as &quot;The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse&quot; (19871988) and &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; (19861991) &quot;sparked something in [him].&quot; He continued, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if this is true for everybody else, but it always seems like, for me, I&#x27;ll start thinking about something and it takes about ten years to actually have it happen, or have someone else believe in it... It took me a few years to get [&quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;] together.&quot;

During the production of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, Martin Olson, one of the writers, read &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot; and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, he had not even considered creating his own series: &quot;After watching Joe [Murray] tear his hair out a lot, dealing with all the problems that came up, I thought I would never want to produce a show of my own.&quot; However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach: &quot;For all those years it seemed like I was doing these two totally separate things. I wondered what it all meant. I didn&#x27;t see a synthesis. It was great when [my two interests] all came together in [a show]. I felt relieved that I hadn&#x27;t wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to do something else. It has been pretty rewarding,&quot; Hillenburg said in 2002. He said that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the Santa Monica Freeway one day.
As he was developing the show&#x27;s concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching experience at the Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, cyclops copepod and sponges. It came to him that the series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: &quot;I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays.&quot; It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, &quot;something that was fantastic but believable.&quot; He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: &quot;I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it&#x27;s a funny animal, a strange one.&quot; In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot;, including Bob the Sponge, who resembles a realistic sea sponge; at first, Hillenburg continued this design because it &quot;was the correct thing to do biologically as a marine-science teacher.&quot; In determining the new character&#x27;s personality, he drew inspiration from innocent, childlike figures that he enjoyed, such as Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jerry Lewis, Pee-wee Herman, Abbott and Costello, and The Three Stooges. While Hillenburg &quot;retained the idea of a living sea sponge,&quot; he soon considered giving the character a square shape (like a kitchen sponge), and realized that this idea would match the character&#x27;s square personality perfectly: &quot;[I]t looked so funny. I think as far as cartoon language goes he was easier to recognize. He seemed to fit the character type I was looking fora somewhat nerdy, squeaky clean .&quot; To voice the central character of the series, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had begun with his role in &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;. Elements of Kenny&#x27;s own personality were employed in further developing the character.

While pitching the cartoon to executives at Nickelodeon, Hillenburg donned a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an &quot;underwater terrarium with models of the characters&quot;, and played Hawaiian music to set the theme. Nickelodeon executive Eric Coleman described the setup as &quot;pretty amazing&quot;. Although Derek Drymon, creative director of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, described the pitch as stressful, he said it went &quot;very well&quot;. Nickelodeon approved and gave Hillenburg money to produce the show.

====Broadcast====
&quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; is Nickelodeon&#x27;s first original Saturday-morning cartoon. It first aired as a preview on May 1, 1999, and officially premiered on July 17 of the same year. Hillenburg noted that the show&#x27;s premise &quot;is that innocence prevailswhich I don&#x27;t think it always does in real life.&quot; It has received positive reviews from critics, and has been noted for its appeal to different age groups. James Poniewozik of &quot;Time&quot; magazine described the titular character as &quot;the anti-Bart Simpson, temperamentally and physically: his head is as squared-off and neat as Bart&#x27;s is unruly, and he has a personality to matchconscientious, optimistic and blind to the faults in the world and those around him.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Joyce Millman said that the show &quot;is clever without being impenetrable to young viewers and goofy without boring grown-ups to tears. It&#x27;s the most charming toon on television, and one of the weirdest [...].Like &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, SpongeBob joyfully dances on the fine line between childhood and adulthood, guilelessness and camp, the warped and the sweet.&quot;

&quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; was an immediate hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook &quot;Pokémon&quot; (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children&#x27;s series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children&#x27;s series on television. Nickelodeon began adding &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change increased the number of older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show&#x27;s total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: &quot;I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can&#x27;t anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it&#x27;s appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience.&quot; &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; has gone on to become the longest-running series on Nickelodeon. &quot;Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. It never was possible to conceive that [...].I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it,&quot; Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show&#x27;s tenth anniversary. Its popularity has made it a media franchise, which is the most-distributed property of MTV Networks. , it has generated $25 billion in merchandising revenue.

====Departure====
In 2002, Hillenburg halted production of the show after the third season was completed to focus on the making of &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; which was released in 2004: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to try and do a movie and the series at the same time. We have 60 episodes and that is probably as many as [Nickelodeon] really needs. It is a standard number for a show like this. I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on doing a good job on the movie,&quot; he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero&#x27;s quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the production of &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, his mentor Jules Engel died at the age of 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory. He said that Engel &quot;truly was the most influential artistic person in [his] life.&quot; &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; grossed $140 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics. The review-aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes rates it 68 percent positive based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. Its consensus states in summary, &quot;Surreally goofy and entertaining for both children and their parents.&quot;
After completing the film, Hillenburg wanted to end the series &quot;so [it] wouldn&#x27;t jump the shark.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;re working on episodes 40 through 60 right now, and I always looked at that as a typical run for an animated show. [&quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;] lasted about that long, for example. And I thought now was a good time to step aside and look at a different project. I personally think it&#x27;s good not to go to the point where people don&#x27;t want to see your show anymore,&quot; Hillenburg said in 2002. However, Nickelodeon wanted to produce more episodes: &quot;The show was such a cash cow for the station that it couldn&#x27;t afford not to,&quot; storyboard director Sam Henderson observed. Initially Hillenburg doubted that the network would continue the show without him, saying: &quot;I think [Nickelodeon executives] respect that my contribution is important. I think they would want to maintain the original concept and quality.&quot; Consequently, he resigned as the showrunner and appointed his trusted staff member Paul Tibbitt to the role. Although he no longer had a direct involvement producing &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, he retained his position as an executive producer and maintained an advisory role, reviewing each episode. Tibbitt started out as a supervising producer but rose up to executive producer when Hillenburg went into semi-retirement in 2004. While he was on the show, he voiced Potty the Parrot and sat in with Derek Drymon at the record studio to direct the voice actors while they were recording. During the fourth season, Tibbitt took on voicing for Potty, while Andrea Romano replaced the two as the voice director.

In 2014, Tibbitt announced on his Twitter account that Hillenburg would return to the show. However, he did not specify what position the former showrunner would hold. As early as 2012, Hillenburg had already been contributing to another film based on the series, which was first reported in 2011 and officially announced the following year, with Tibbitt as director. Tibbitt also wrote the story with Hillenburg, who &quot;[had] been in the studio everyday working with [the crew].&quot; Besides writing, Hillenburg also executive-produced. He said in 2014: &quot;Actually when [the film] wraps, I want to get back to the show. ...it is getting harder and harder to come up with stories. So Paul [Tibbitt] and I are really going to brainstorm and come up with fresh material.&quot; Called &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot;, the second film adaptation was released in 2015 to positive critical reception, currently holding a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 80 percent and an average rating of 6.5/10. It earned $323.4 million worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film based on an animated television show, behind &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; (2007).

===Other pursuits===
In 1998, Hillenburg formed Inc., a television and film production company, which produces &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and related media. From 2011 to 2018, the company published &quot;SpongeBob Comics&quot;, a comic-book series based on the cartoon. Hillenburg announced the venture in a 2011 press release, where he said, &quot;I&#x27;m hoping that fans will enjoy finally having a &quot;SpongeBob&quot; comic book from me.&quot; Various cartoonists, including James Kochalka, Hilary Barta, Graham Annable, Gregg Schigiel, and Jacob Chabot, have contributed to issues of the comic.

According to Jeff Lenburg, in his book &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Animated Cartoons&quot;, Hillenburg was co-writing and co-directing a second animated feature film based on Rob Zombie&#x27;s comic-book series, &quot;The Haunted World of El Superbeasto&quot;, which was slated for a 2006 release. He helped to write &quot;Diggs Tailwagger&quot;, a 2007 pilot by Derek Drymon.

In 2010, he began working on &quot;Hollywood Blvd., USA&quot;, a new short film for animation festivals. In making the two-minute film, he videotaped people walking and animated them in walk cycles. Hillenburg said in 2012, &quot;I hope to get [the film] done. It takes forever.&quot; He was aiming to finish it that fall. In 2013, three years after production began, &quot;Hollywood Blvd., USA&quot; was released to festivals. Hillenburg characterized it as a &quot;personal film&quot; and said that &quot;it&#x27;s not a narrative. It&#x27;s just really about people in our town.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1998, Hillenburg married Karen Jean Umland, a Southern Californian chef who teaches at the New School of Cooking in Culver City. He deemed her the funniest person he knew, and the character of Karen Plankton was named after her. Also in 1998, their son was born. Hillenburg formerly resided in Hollywood and Pasadena, and lived with his family in San Marino, California until his death. His hobbies included surfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, swimming, and performing &quot;noisy rock music&quot; on his guitar. He jammed with his son, who is a drummer, which Hillenburg called &quot;a great way to bond with each other.&quot; He also enjoyed birdwatching at home, but said that he was always &quot;an ocean freak&quot;.

According to his colleagues, he was &quot;a perfectionist workaholic&quot;, and was also known for his private nature. Julia Pistor, co-producer of &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, noted that Hillenburg was &quot;very shy&quot;. She said: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t want people to know about his life or family. He&#x27;s just a really funny, down-to-earth guy with a dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our corporate integrity.&quot; Hillenburg said about himself: &quot;I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like people, but I like having my privacy.&quot;

Hillenburg&#x27;s graphic influences were George Herriman, E. C. Segar, Bill Watterson, Dr. Seuss, Max Fleischer, Chuck Jones, Tex Avery, Bob Clampett, Jay Ward, Jules Engel, Matt Groening, Joe Murray and John Kricfalusi; the latter was inspired to have many close-up shots in several SpongeBob episodes to have grotesque and extremely detailed drawings. He had also cited Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Laurel &amp; Hardy, The Three Stooges, W.C. Fields, Jerry Lewis, Jacques Cousteau, Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;The Muppets&quot; and Paul Reubens&#x27;s &quot;Pee-wee Herman&quot;. 

===Philanthropy===
Hillenburg, with his wife Karen, endowed numerous projects and organizations through the United Plankton Charitable Trust, which they established in 2005, naming after Hillenburg&#x27;s United Plankton Pictures. It supports areas of their personal interest, giving under $500,000 annually . Grantees include large, established arts-related organizations such as the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Society for the Activation of Social Space through Art and Sound, in which Karen is co-chair. Health accounts for most of their grantmaking; they had gifted Planned Parenthood (where Karen has been on the board of directors ) and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, among other national health organizations.

In education, they have donated to schools, including the Polytechnic School in Pasadena (which their son attended), CalArts, and Humboldt State University. Donations to the latter helped fund the HSU Marine Lab and the Stephen Hillenburg Marine Science Research Award Endowment, which the couple created in 2018 to support the university&#x27;s marine-science research students. The previous year, the Princess Grace Foundation introduced the Stephen Hillenburg Animation Scholarship, an annual grant from the Hillenburgs to emerging animators.

==Illness and death==
Hillenburg disclosed to &quot;Variety&quot; magazine in March 2017 that he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease), though he continued to work on &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; for as long as he was able. He added: &quot;My family and I are grateful for the outpouring of love and support. We ask that our sincere request for privacy be honored during this time.&quot; Hillenburg was in the early stages of the disease at the time, according to a source close to him. During his last days as executive producer, he had difficulty speaking, and it ultimately got to the point where he stopped going to his office due to the progression of the illness.

Hillenburg died on November 26, 2018, at the age of 57. According to his death certificate obtained by &quot;TMZ&quot;, he died at his home in San Marino, California. It also states that his body was cremated, and that his ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California the next day.

==Legacy==
During the halftime show for Super Bowl LIII, the performing band Maroon 5 arranged to use a clip from the &quot;SpongeBob&quot; episode &quot;Band Geeks&quot; (which uses the song &quot;Sweet Victory&quot; as part of a spoof of a football halftime show) during their show as a means to pay tribute to Hillenburg. A full clip of the &quot;Sweet Victory&quot; song, including a dedication to Hillenburg, was played inside Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The song was later included in a promo for ViacomCBS&#x27;s Paramount+ streaming service during Super Bowl LV. A full, all-CGI version was broadcast before Nickelodeon&#x27;s broadcast of Super Bowl LVIII.

The TV special &quot;SpongeBob&#x27;s Big Birthday Blowout&quot; and the theatrical film &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot; which he worked on, are dedicated to his memory.

The day after Super Bowl LIII, the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League uploaded on their Twitter page a modified version of the full &quot;Sweet Victory&quot; sequence, in which the band&#x27;s uniforms were altered from red to green to match the Stars&#x27;s colors, with the title &quot;The #SuperBowl halftime show fans deserve&quot;. The Stars&#x27;s video had previously been shown during their February 1 game against the Minnesota Wild.

In 2019, a spin-off of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Kamp Koral&quot;, began production, featuring younger versions of the characters attending summer camp. Former showrunner Paul Tibbitt stated that Hillenburg would have disliked the idea; he commented, &quot;Steve would always say to me, &#x27;You know, one of these days, they&#x27;re going to want to make &quot;SpongeBob Babies&quot;. That&#x27;s when I&#x27;m out of here. Tibbitt also released a statement stating, &quot;I do not mean any disrespect to my colleagues who are working on this show ... [but] they all know full well Steve would have hated this.&quot; The concept of &quot;Kamp Koral&quot; came from a season 12 meeting in October 2018, a month before Hillenburg died. Hillenburg is credited as the creator of &quot;Kamp Koral&quot;, and is credited on other spin-offs as the characters&#x27; creator.

==Awards and honors==

In 1992, one of Hillenburg&#x27;s early works, &quot;Wormholes&quot;, won for Best Concept at the Ottawa International Animation Festival. For &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, Hillenburg was nominated for 17 Emmy Awards, winning in the categories of Outstanding Special Class Animated Program and Outstanding Sound Editing – Animation in 2010 and 2014, respectively. The show has also received several other awards and nominations, including 17 Annie Award nominations, winning six times, as well as winning two British Academy Children&#x27;s Awards, out of four nominations. In 2002, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; won its first TCA Award for Outstanding Achievement in Children&#x27;s Programming nomination.

In 2001, Heal the Bay, an environmental nonprofit organization, honored Hillenburg with its Walk the Talk award. He was recognized for raising public awareness of marine life through &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. The following year, Hillenburg was given the Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society, and the Princess Grace Statue Award from the Princess Grace Foundation. In 2018, Hillenburg received the Winsor McCay Award at the 45th Annie Awards, and a special recognition at the 45th Daytime Emmy Awards &quot;for his contribution and impact made in the animation field and within the broadcast industry.&quot;

The marine demosponge species &quot;Clathria hillenburgi&quot;, known from mangrove habitats off the coast of Paraíba, Brazil, was named in honor of Stephen Hillenburg.

On November 18, 2021, Hillenburg was honored with a bench and historical plaque at his alma mater Savannah High School in Anaheim, California. The project was a collaboration between the Hillenburg family, Anaheim Historical Society, and YouTube personality Griffin Hansen. Karen Hillenburg specifically chose a bright yellow bench that &quot;she thought perfectly captured her husband&#x27;s warmth and goofiness&quot;. The memorial was dedicated one day before Savanna High School&#x27;s 60th anniversary at a school-wide assembly hosted by Hansen and principal Michael Pooley. The event was attended by Karen and Clay Hillenburg, as well as members of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;&#x27; cast and crew including Tom Kenny, Jill Talley, Rodger Bumpass, Bill Fagerbakke, Clancy Brown, Mr. Lawrence, Marc Ceccarelli, and Derek Drymon.

<text>The House of Puzyna is a Rurikid princely house, now already living in Poland for several centuries. Originally they were from Ruthenia and the region of Smolensk. Their most prominent members lived in the early 20th century.

During the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, they were counted as Litvin princes, the highest nobility of Lithuania. Of Ruthenian origin.

== History ==
Mostly because the archival documentation of the 14th century is weak, thanks to Mongol depredations, their precise lineage from Rurik is under shroud. Their tradition, as well as that of the family of Oginskis, refer to them being descended from rulers of the principality of Kozelsk.
Several versions of their precise Rurikid origins have been presented.

The Rurikid dynasty&#x27;s branch of Kozelsk flourished in the 14th century. As one of the Oka principalities in the region of Upper Oka, near Smolensk. These princes were said to be descended from Saint Michael of Chernihiv who was martyred in 1246. (It is generally in published family trees that their one forefather was St.Michael&#x27;s descendant prince Tit - but nothing more is actually known of this Tit than merely his name, without even explicit attestation of his patronymic, and names of one or more of his historically attested sons, and that in those generations his family -branch- held Kozelsk and Karachev. We can be relatively certain of this Tit&#x27;s existence because at least one son of his in mid-14th century carried the patronymic &#x27;Titovich&#x27; in his near-contemporary documentation.)
Better historical sources know the early forefathers of the Puzyna and Oginskis, princes bynamed Hlazyna and Gluszonek who were magnates in the region of Smolensk in the late 15th century.
These princes Hlazyna would thus have been descendants of some branch of Dukes of Kozelsk.

In 1408 the Duke of Kozelsk held Rzhev, had the town built. He was possibly merely a kinsman of the Oginski and Puzyna ancestors, and not their direct forefather, as the Kozelsk family seems to have developed several branches already prior to that date.

* There are historically weak beliefs that the Puzyna were branched from the Oginskis by the somewhat unhistorical brothers Grigor &#x27;the fire&#x27; (for his hot temper) and Valadimir &#x27;the bubble&#x27; (for being obese), allegedly respectively forefathers of the Oginski and the Puzyna, who would have been sons of a prince Tit or a prince Juri or a prince Tit-Juri, of Kozelsk, one allegedly in the 15th generation from Rurik. However, sources contemporary to those centuries do not mention such things (source: Rodoslovtsah). These still have found their way to a lot of genealogies (compare for example the publications of Peter V Dolgorukov). Quite possibly, this another, later Tit is just a genealogically invented ghost of the real Tit whose existence is known from his son&#x27;s patronymic.

In 1486, boyar Dmitrijus Ivanovicius Hlushonokas received the manor and fief of Oginty in Zhizhmorski, Lithuania proper. His descendants became known as Oginskis, the Lithuanian branch of the Hlazyna. Prince Teodoras Bogdanaitis appears as the first of this lineage with the byname Oginski.

In the early 16th century, Dmitrijus&#x27; younger brother, the Belarusian prince Ivan Ivanovich Hluszonak was contemporary of king Sigismund I of Poland as well as his official, and his son prince Timofej Ivanovich was known with byname &#x27;puzyna&#x27;. It was this branch which developed to the lineage of Puzyna. Vasilij Ivanovich received from king in 1516 the estate of Nosov in Melnitski (&quot;Археографический сборник документов, относящихся к истории Северо-Западной Руси&quot;, t. 3, №4, p. 4-5). It seems that these persons are present in later generations of Puzyna in the works of Dolgorukov, as well as in the findings of the Polish Jesuit Andrzej Pezharski, in his book &#x27;Annibal ad Portas&#x27;.
The name of Puzyna appears to have been found in chronicles in the 16th century.

So, the two bynames (Oginskis and Puzyna) actually formed only in later generations of the two brothers, and not yet to the two brothers themselves. But it has been easy although mistaken to try to make already two brothers to carry the nicknames. Since bynames of the real historically attested brothers Dimitrijus and Ivan were actually not such, this has presumably led to confusions about what were the first names of the two brothers who started the branches, some thus picking up the unhistorical names Grigor and Valadimir, as well as the &#x27;mythical&#x27; forefather name Tit (who was real person in the ancestry but farther back) as their father.

These two brothers (Dimitrijus, Ivan) were sons of prince Ivan Vasilievich, son of one Vasili Hlazyna, a Ruthenian princely magnate in region of Smolensk. All in all, prince Ivan Vasilievich had five sons: Dmitri, Ivan, Leo, Michael and Andrew, according to Ptashitski.

Vasili Hlazyna&#x27;s other son (according to S L Ptashitski) was prince Olehno Vasilievich, who fled to Moscow and thus left Belarusia-Lithuania.

The princes of Puzyna have as their earliest historically attested patrilineal forefather the said Vasili Hlazyna in the mid-15th century - just as the record-harmed Mongol-domination epoch was over. In light of strict research, there is not an attested lineage back to Rurikids. They just appear from post-Mongol mists of history.
However, the princely title which was accorded to the family, speaks for a Rurikid patriline.
The Rurikid DNA project by Y DNA evidence has proven that the Puzyna belong to the patriline of the Rurikids. The tradition being Rurikid is correct.

<text>A council circle is a distinctive feature at the center of some tribal communities in North America. The historical function of the council circles is debated. Some suggest that the talking circles are ceremonial, and others support a hypothesis that they were places for political discussion that suggest aboriginal democracy.

In current use, the council circle is often synonymous with the talking circle, and is a means of group communication that promotes input from all the members. The practice has been adopted by people of many cultures. A talking stick, or other significant or impromptu object, is passed around the circle, and only the circle member holding the stick is allowed to speak, though he or she may allow others to interject.

Talking sticks in the context of the council circle may have been used pre-historically by indigenous peoples to create egalitarian forums. Photographs show that some talking sticks were very tall, suggesting that circle participants would have stood when speaking.

<doc id="1246675" wikidata="Q628723" url="?curid=1246675" title="Dead time">
<text>For detection systems that record discrete events, such as particle and nuclear detectors, the dead time is the time after each event during which the system is not able to record another event.
An everyday life example of this is what happens when someone takes a photo using a flash – another picture cannot be taken immediately afterward because the flash needs a few seconds to recharge. In addition to lowering the detection efficiency, dead times can have other effects, such as creating possible exploits in quantum cryptography.

==Overview==
The total dead time of a detection system is usually due to the contributions of the intrinsic dead time of the detector (for example the ion drift time in a gaseous ionization detector), of the analog front end (for example the shaping time of a spectroscopy amplifier) and of the data acquisition (the conversion time of the analog-to-digital converters and the readout and storage times).

The intrinsic dead time of a detector is often due to its physical characteristics; for example a spark chamber is &quot;dead&quot; until the potential between the plates recovers above a high enough value. In other cases the detector, after a first event, is still &quot;live&quot; and does produce a signal for the successive event, but the signal is such that the detector readout is unable to discriminate and separate them, resulting in an event loss or in a so-called &quot;pile-up&quot; event where, for example, a (possibly partial) sum of the deposited energies from the two events is recorded instead. In some cases this can be minimised by an appropriate design, but often only at the expense of other properties like energy resolution.

The analog electronics can also introduce dead time; in particular a shaping spectroscopy amplifier needs to integrate a fast rise, slow fall signal over the longest possible time (usually 0.5–10 microseconds) to attain the best possible resolution, such that the user needs to choose a compromise between event rate and resolution.

Trigger logic is another possible source of dead time; beyond the proper time of the signal processing, spurious triggers caused by noise need to be taken into account.

Finally, digitisation, readout and storage of the event, especially in detection systems with large number of channels like those used in modern High Energy Physics experiments, also contribute to the total dead time. To alleviate the issue, medium and large experiments use sophisticated pipelining and multi-level trigger logic to reduce the readout rates.

From the total time a detection system is running, the dead time must be subtracted to obtain the live time.

==Paralyzable and non-paralyzable behaviour==
A detector, or detection system, can be characterized by a &quot;paralyzable&quot; or &quot;non-paralyzable&quot; behaviour.
In a non-paralyzable detector, an event happening during the dead time is simply lost, so that with an increasing event rate the detector will reach a saturation rate equal to the inverse of the dead time. In a paralyzable detector, an event happening during the dead time will not just be missed, but will restart the dead time, so that with increasing rate the detector will reach a saturation point where it will be incapable of recording any event at all. A semi-paralyzable detector exhibits an intermediate behaviour, in which the event arriving during dead time does extend it, but not by the full amount, resulting in a detection rate that decreases when the event rate approaches saturation.

== Analysis ==
It will be assumed that the events are occurring randomly with an average frequency of &quot;f&quot;. That is, they constitute a Poisson process. The probability that an event will occur in an infinitesimal time interval &quot;dt&quot; is then &quot;f dt&quot;. It follows that the probability &quot;P(t)&quot; that an event will occur at time &quot;t&quot;  to &quot;t+dt&quot; with no events occurring between &quot;t=0&quot; and time &quot;t&quot;  is given by the exponential distribution (Lucke 1974, Meeks 2008):

:formula_1

The expected time between events is then

:formula_2

=== Non-paralyzable analysis ===
For the non-paralyzable case, with a dead time of formula_3, the probability of measuring an event between formula_4 and formula_5 is zero. Otherwise the probabilities of measurement are the same as the event probabilities. The probability of measuring an event at time &quot;t&quot; with no intervening measurements is then given by an exponential distribution shifted by formula_3:

:formula_7 for formula_8

:formula_9 for formula_10

The expected time between measurements is then

:formula_11

In other words, if formula_12 counts are recorded during a particular time interval formula_13 and the dead time is known, the actual number of events (&quot;N&quot;) may be estimated by 

:formula_14

If the dead time is not known, a statistical analysis can yield the correct count. For example, (Meeks 2008), if formula_15 are a set of intervals between measurements, then the formula_15 will have a shifted exponential distribution, but if a fixed value &quot;D&quot; is subtracted from each interval, with negative values discarded, the distribution will be exponential as long as &quot;D&quot; is greater than the dead time formula_3. For an exponential distribution, the following relationship holds:

:formula_18

where &quot;n&quot; is any integer. If the above function is estimated for many measured intervals with various values of &quot;D&quot; subtracted (and for various values of &quot;n&quot;) it should be found that for values of &quot;D&quot; above a certain threshold, the above equation will be nearly true, and the count rate derived from these modified intervals will be equal to the true count rate.

==Time-To-Count==
With a modern microprocessor based ratemeter one technique for measuring field strength with detectors (e.g., Geiger–Müller tubes) with a recovery time is Time-To-Count. In this technique, the detector is armed at the same time a counter is started. When a strike occurs, the counter is stopped. If this happens many times in a certain time period (e.g., two seconds), then the mean time between strikes can be determined, and thus the count rate. Live time, dead time, and total time are thus measured, not estimated. This technique is used quite widely in radiation monitoring systems used in nuclear power generating stations.

<text>Edge is a multi-format video game magazine published by Future plc. It is a UK-based magazine and publishes 13 issues annually. The magazine was launched by Steve Jarratt. It has also released foreign editions in Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.

== History ==
The magazine was launched in October 1993 by Steve Jarratt, a long-time video games journalist who has launched several other magazines for Future.

The artwork for the cover of the magazine&#x27;s 100th issue was specially provided by Shigeru Miyamoto. The 200th issue was released in March 2009 with 200 different covers, each commemorating a single game; 199 variants were in general circulation, and one was exclusive to subscribers. Only 200 magazines were printed with each cover, sufficient to more than satisfy &quot;Edge&quot;″s circulation of 28,898.

In October 2003, the then-editor of &quot;Edge&quot;, João Diniz-Sanches, left the magazine along with deputy editor David McCarthy and other staff writers. After the walkout, the editorship of &quot;Edge&quot; passed back to Tony Mott, who had been editor prior to Diniz-Sanches. The only team member to remain was Margaret Robertson, who in 2006 replaced Mott as editor. In May 2007, Robertson stepped down as editor and was replaced by Tony Mott, taking over as editor for the third time. Alex Wiltshire was the magazine&#x27;s editor from May 2012 to March 2013, followed by Nathan Brown. Jen Simpkins took over the editor&#x27;s role from Nathan Brown in April 2020.

Between 1995 and 2002, some of the content from the UK edition of &quot;Edge&quot; was published in the United States as &quot;Next Generation&quot;. In 2007, Future&#x27;s US subsidiary, Future US began re-publishing selected recent &quot;Edge&quot; features on the &quot;Next Generation&quot; website; the &quot;Edge&quot; website and blog were subsequently incorporated into the &quot;NextGen&quot; site. In July 2008, the whole site was rebranded under the &quot;Edge&quot; title, as that was the senior of the two brands. In May 2014 it was reported that Future intended to close the websites of &quot;Edge&quot;, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; and their other videogame publications; in December 2014, it was confirmed that the &quot;C&amp;VG&quot; website would close and its content would instead be published at GamesRadar, and in January 2015, it was announced that the same would happen to the &quot;Edge&quot; website. Between 2015 and 2018, &quot;Edge&quot; articles were occasionally republished on &quot;Kotaku UK&quot;.

&quot;Edge&quot; has been redesigned three times since the magazine launched. The first redesign occurred in 1999; the second in 2004; and the third in 2011. The first redesign altered the magazine&#x27;s dimensions to be wider than the original shape. The latest design changes the magazine&#x27;s physical dimensions for the second time, and introduces a higher quality of paper stock than was previously used.

==Features==
Each issue includes a &quot;Making-of&quot; article on a particular game, usually including an interview with one of the original developers. Issue 143 introduced the &quot;Time Extend&quot; series of retrospective articles. Like the &quot;making-of&quot; series, each focuses on a single game and, with the benefit of hindsight, gives an in-depth examination of its most interesting or innovative attributes.

&quot;Codeshop&quot; examines more technical subjects such as 3D modelling programs or physics middleware, while &quot;Studio Profile&quot; and &quot;University Profile&quot; are single-page summaries (&quot;like Top Trumps, but for game dev&quot;) of particular developers or publishers, and game-related courses at higher education institutions.

Although an overall list of contributors is printed in each issue&#x27;s indicia, the magazine typically has not used bylines to credit individual writers to specific reviews and articles, instead only referring to the anonymous &quot;Edge&quot; as a whole. Since 2014, some contributed features are credited with a byline. The magazine&#x27;s regular columnists have been consistently credited throughout the magazine&#x27;s run. The current columnists are James Leach, Clint Hocking and Tadhg Kelly. In addition, several columnists appear toward the beginning of the magazine to talk about the game industry as a whole, rather than focusing on specific game design topics. They are &quot;Trigger Happy&quot; author Steven Poole, Leigh Alexander, and Brian Howe, whose parody article section &quot;You&#x27;re Playing It Wrong&quot; began with the new redesign.

Previous columnists have included Paul Rose (&quot;Mr Biffo&quot;, the founder of &quot;Digitiser&quot;), Toshihiro Nagoshi of Sega&#x27;s Amusement Vision, author Tim Guest (whose column on MMOs preceded the publication of his book &quot;Second Lives&quot;), N&#x27;Gai Croal, and game developer Jeff Minter. In addition, numerous columns were published anonymously under the pseudonym &quot;RedEye&quot;, and several Japanese writers contributed to a regular feature called &quot;Something About Japan&quot;.

James Hutchinson&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Crashlander&quot; was featured in &quot;Edge&quot; between issues 143 and 193.

==Scoring==
&quot;Edge&quot; scores games on a ten-point scale, from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 10, with five as ostensibly the average rating. For much of the magazine&#x27;s run, the magazine&#x27;s review policy stated that the scores broadly correspond to one of the following &quot;sentiments&quot;:

#disastrous
#appalling
#severely flawed
#disappointing
#average
#competent
#distinguished
#excellent
#astounding
#revolutionary

However, with issue 143 the scoring system was changed to a simple list of &quot;10 = ten, 9 = nine...&quot; and so on, a tongue-in-cheek reference to people who read too much into review scores. It was almost three years before &quot;Edge&quot; gave a game a rating of ten out of ten, and to date the score has been given to twenty-seven games:


In contrast, only two titles have received a one-out-of-ten rating, &quot;Kabuki Warriors&quot; and &quot;FlatOut 3: Chaos &amp; Destruction&quot;.

===Retrospective awards===
In a December 2002 retro gaming special, &quot;Edge&quot; retrospectively awarded ten-out-of-ten ratings to two titles released before the magazine&#x27;s launch:

*&quot;Elite&quot; (originally released in 1984)
*&quot;Exile&quot; (originally released in 1988)

&quot;Edge&quot; also awarded a 10/10 score in one of the regular retrospective reviews in the magazine&#x27;s normal run:

*&quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (originally released in 1985)

In &quot;Edge&quot;″s 10th anniversary issue in 2003, &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; (1997) was included as one of the magazine&#x27;s top ten shooters, along with a note that it was perhaps &quot;the only other game&quot; that should have received a ten out of ten rating. The game had originally been awarded a nine out of ten, with the magazine later stating that &quot;a ten was considered, but eventually rejected&quot;.

&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, which came second in &quot;Edge Presents The 100 Best Videogames&quot;, originally obtained a nine, but according to the &quot;100 Best Videogames&quot; issue, it came &quot;as near as dammit to the sixth (at the time) &quot;Edge&quot; ten&quot;.

The 20th anniversary issue (E258) published in August 2013 carried a feature called &quot;The Ten Amendments&quot;, in which the following seven games&#x27; scores were retrospectively adjusted to ten-out-of-ten. A rationale was provided for each.

*&quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; (Nintendo 64)
*&quot;Advance Wars&quot; (Game Boy Advance)
*&quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; (GameCube)
*&quot;Drop7&quot; (iOS, Android)
*&quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3)
*&quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot; (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Arcade)
*&quot;Dark Souls&quot; (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows)

==Special issues==
A number of &quot;Edge&quot; special editions were published in the UK. These included:

;&quot;1996 essential hardware guide&quot; (1996)
:Special edition issue focussing on PS1, Saturn, Ultra 64, PC CD-ROM, 3DO, M2, Atari Jaguar, Amiga, Virtual Boy, Mega Drive, Super Nintendo. This was the first special edition produced, the front and spine displaying Premiere Issue.
;&quot;Essential hardware guide 2000&quot; (2000)
: Special edition featuring the top ten formats ever, Sir Clive revisits the ZX Spectrum and sections on Xbox, PSOne, PS2, Dreamcast, Gamecube, GScube, Game Boy Color, PC, Game Boy Advance, Wonderswan Color, Ericsson R380s, Palm IIIc and GP32.
;&quot;The 100 most significant reviews from the first 100 issues&quot; (2001)
:A collection of reprints of notable reviews from the magazine&#x27;s history, along with retrospective commentary on each game. In addition to reviews of popular titles (including the three &quot;ten out of ten&quot; scores that had been awarded during that period), it also included &quot;Edge&quot;&#x27;s comments on notable hyped disappointments such as &quot;Rise of the Robots&quot; and &quot;Daikatana&quot;. The issue also included an index of the content of those 100 issues of the magazine.
;&quot;Retro: The guide to classic videogame playing and collecting&quot; (2002)
:This retrogaming-themed special issue applied the format of the standard edition of &quot;Edge&quot; to classic video games. This was the most fully formed of the &quot;Edge&quot; specials, being an edition that only featured new material.
;&quot;Retro: &#x27;The making of...&#x27; special&quot; (2002)
: The second edition in the Retro series was a collection of &quot;Making of&quot; features, most of which had run previously in the main magazine. These features usually contained interviews with the makers of classic video games talking about the process involved in their title&#x27;s creation.
;&quot;Edge presents Equip: PlayStation 2 edition&quot;
;&quot;Edge presents Equip: GameCube edition&quot;
;&quot;Edge presents Equip: PC edition&quot;
;&quot;Edge presents Equip: Xbox edition&quot;
:Each Equip issue discussed the state of a particular games platform, looking back on significant releases with the benefit of hindsight and outlining future developments. For example, the GameCube issue featured lengthy retrospectives on &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot; and &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, plus a feature on upcoming titles that would use the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable.
;&quot;Specials issue ten: &quot;Retro: The Collector&#x27;s Series&quot;&quot;: This final edition in the Retro series reprinted all of the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Series&quot; of articles from the main magazine. Each feature focused on a specific video game console of yesteryear and examined its history and the collectors market surrounding its rare or collectable games. Unusually for &quot;Edge&quot;, the majority of these articles were written by one video games journalist: Simon Parkin, a long-time freelance contributor to the magazine.
;&quot;Edge presents FILE Volume 1 - Issues 1-12: The birth of a new generation&quot; (2006)
;&quot;Edge presents FILE Volume 2 - Issues 13-24: The new generation shows its strength&quot; (2007)
;&quot;Edge presents FILE Volume 3 - Issues 25-36: Videogame culture enters a new era&quot; (2007)
:Three &quot;File&quot; editions reprinted selected content originally published between 1993 and 1996 in &quot;Edge&quot; issues 1–36. Each volume of &quot;File&quot; covered 12 issues.
;&quot;Edge presents... The Art Of Videogames&quot; (2007)
:This went on sale 26 April 2007 showcasing the visual aspect of gaming.
;&quot;Edge presents... The 100 Best Videogames&quot; (2007)
:On sale from 3 July 2007. The list was compiled through a combination of suggestions from &quot;Edge&quot; readers, &quot;Edge&quot; staff and additional &quot;industry experts&quot;. Each game in the list had a retrospective article, a full-page illustration, and a sidebar listing readers&#x27; comments. In addition, the volume contained reprints of the magazine&#x27;s previous &quot;Top 100&quot; lists from 2000 (issue 80) and 2003 (issue 128). The top 10 of &quot;Edge Presents The 100 Best Videogames&quot; were:
:# &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;
:# &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;
:# &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;
:# &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;
:# &quot;Super Mario World&quot;
:# &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;
:# &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;
:# &quot;Tetris&quot;
:# &quot;Super Metroid&quot;
;&quot;An Edge Special Edition - &quot;the 100 greatest videogames&quot;&quot; (2015)
:The issue has a similar format to the previous volume in that each game in the list has a retrospective article accompanied by a full-page illustration (often a piece of concept art from the game). The list was composed solely by &quot;Edge&quot; staff; there are no sidebars with readers&#x27; comments. The &quot;Top 100&quot; lists contained in the 2007 volume were not reprinted.
:The criteria &quot;Edge&quot; used when compiling the list were simple: games from any platform were eligible, series featuring straight-up sequels could only include a single entry, and the games in the list &quot;had to stand up today rather than making the cut for reasons of nostalgia or historic significance.&quot;
:The top 10 of &quot;the 100 greatest videogames&quot; were:
:# &quot;Dark Souls&quot;
:# &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;
:# &quot;The Last of Us&quot;
:# &quot;Bloodborne&quot;
:# &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;
:# &quot;Tetris&quot;
:# &quot;Super Mario Galaxy 2&quot;
:# &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;
:# &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;
:# &quot;Minecraft&quot;
;&quot;An Edge Special Edition - &quot;the 100 greatest videogames&quot;&quot; (2017)
:# &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&quot;
:# Dark Souls (video game)
:# &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;
:# &quot;The Last of Us&quot;
:# &quot;Bloodborne&quot;

==Foreign editions==

===Australia===
An Australian edition was briefly published in early 2004, for less than six months. The Australian edition consisted mostly of content from the UK edition, along with news on the local games industry.

===Brazil===
The Brazilian edition was launched in Brazil in May 2009. It includes articles translated from the UK magazine alongside original local content. The magazine was cancelled in November 2010, with 18 issues.

===France===
A translated selection of articles are published with the French magazine .
In 2017, La Financière de Loisirs licensed the title for France, starting with a 200 pages special issue about popular games that changed the gaming industry, as well AAA as indies.

===Germany===
In November 2005, a German translation was launched by the publishing house Computec Media AG. The German edition was thinner than the English original, the covers were slightly changed and the ratings raised. In January 2007 it was changed to a bi-monthly schedule and in July 2007 it was finally shut down.

===Italian===

In October 2004, an Italian localised edition was launched under the name &quot;Videogiochi&quot; and published by Future Italy. In December 2006, Future Italy was sold to Sprea Editori which renamed it &quot;Game Pro&quot; in May 2007. Last issue: September 2009.

===Spanish===
A localised edition of &quot;Edge&quot; was launched in Spain on 15 April 2006 by publisher Globus, which shares some staff from the &quot;On/Off&quot; editorial, a Globus magazine about DVD video and consumer technology, not in any way related to video games. It lacks some articles contained in the UK edition, such as the &quot;Virtua Fighter 5&quot; story which was omitted from the corresponding Spanish edition.

At the end of May 2009, a post in the official &quot;Edge&quot; Spanish forums made by the main administrator, stated that Globus was about to close its video game division, which meant the closure of the Spanish edition of &quot;Edge&quot; and &quot;NGamer&quot;.

In October 2017, a new official &quot;Edge&quot; Spanish edition is released. A new number comes every two months.

<text>Paloalto is a rock band formed in Los Angeles, California. The band is not named after the city Palo Alto, but rather the lead singer and frontman James Grundler&#x27;s preschool. Their debut album was released on Rick Rubin&#x27;s American Recordings label and was produced by Rubin. Their second album, &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, reached #14 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart in 2003, on the strength of the song &quot;Breathe In&quot;, which had been featured on The O.C. The song &quot;Try&quot; was the theme song on the 2003 Warner Brothers show &quot;Tarzan&quot;.

After the band dissolved, Grundler formed a new band called Golden State. As of 2021, Grundler is still actively releasing new material under Golden State.

Paloalto has occasionally played a few reunion shows in the 2010s. On August 15, 2014, the band performed a reunion show at The Viper Room in West Hollywood, California. To commemorate the event, Grundler released the single “Don’t Give Up Before You Start”, the first release under the Paloalto name in over ten years. In 2018, the band performed live again supporting Walking Papers.

<text>The Chinese alligator (; ), also known as the Yangtze alligator (), China alligator, or historically the muddy dragon, is a crocodilian endemic to China. It and the American alligator (&quot;A. mississippiensis&quot;) are the only living species in the genus &quot;Alligator&quot; of the family Alligatoridae. Dark gray or black in color with a fully armored body, the Chinese alligator grows to in length and weighs as an adult. It brumates in burrows in winter and is nocturnal in summer. Mating occurs in early summer, with females most commonly producing 20–30 eggs, which are smaller than those of any other crocodilian. The species is an opportunistic feeder, primarily eating fish and invertebrates. A vocal species, adults bellow during the mating season and young vocalize to communicate with their parents and other juveniles. Captive specimens have reached age 70, and wild specimens can live past 50.

Living in bodies of fresh water, the Chinese alligator&#x27;s range is restricted to six regions in the province of Anhui, as well as possibly the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Originally living as far away from its current range as Japan, the species previously had a wide range and population, but beginning in 6000 BC, multiple threats, such as habitat destruction, caused the species&#x27; population and range to decline. The population in the wild was about 1,000 in the 1970s, decreased to below 130 in 2001, and grew after 2003, with its population being about 300 as of 2017. Listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, multiple conservation actions have been taking place for this species.

The Chinese alligator has been a part of Chinese literature since the third century. In the late 13th century, Marco Polo became the first person outside of China to write about it. In some writings, the Chinese alligator has been associated with the Chinese dragon. Many pieces of evidence suggest that the Chinese alligator was an inspiration for the Chinese dragon.

== History and taxonomy ==
The oldest definitive record of the Chinese alligator is from the late Pliocene of Japan, around 3 million years old. Pleistocene fossils show that its range was once much more extensive, extending northwards to Shandong and southwards to the Taiwan Strait.

Chinese alligators were mentioned in Chinese literature very early; for example, in the Classic of Poetry, whose poems were composed between the 11th and 7th centuries BCE. Marco Polo was the first person outside of China to write about the alligator, when he came to China and saw it in the late 1200s. He said that the alligator lived in &quot;caverns&quot; in the day and hunted at night, and that humans targeted its meat and skin, with its gall bladder having multiple medical purposes. He stated that it was found in lakes, rivers, and springs in the province &quot;Karazan&quot;. In 1656, Martino Martini, a priest, wrote that the Chinese alligator lived in the river Yangtze and was &quot;much feared by the local residents&quot;. Unlike Polo, Martini wrote his description using information from Chinese literature. Chinese alligators were later thought to give Buddhist priests merit if the priests were to buy alligators held in captivity and release them. In 1869, Robert Swinhoe saw a Chinese alligator in an exhibit in Shanghai and wrote the following year:

=== Classification ===
The Chinese alligator was scientifically described by French naturalist Albert-Auguste Fauvel in 1879 as &quot;Alligator sinensis&quot;; though Fauvel only noticed mentions of them in Chinese literature since about 222–227 CE. The genus &quot;Alligator&quot; had previously contained only the American alligator since its creation in 1807. Fauvel wrote a detailed description of the species in a book titled &quot;Alligators in China: Their History, Description &amp; Identification&quot;, including information about its historical account. In 1947, it was suggested to group the Chinese alligator in a separate genus from its American relative, due to the Chinese alligator&#x27;s bony plate on its upper eyelid. This bony plate is present in caimans, but is rarely present in the American alligator. At the time, the plate was thought to not appear in the American alligator at all. This produced the belief that the Chinese alligator&#x27;s relationship with other crocodilians was between caimans and American alligators. Paulus Edward Pieris Deraniyagala described the genus &quot;Caigator&quot; the same year, which only contained the Chinese alligator, making its scientific name &quot;Caigator sinensis&quot;. However, paleontology has shown that the Chinese alligator has evolved from other now-extinct members of the genus &quot;Alligator&quot;. This and the fact that the American alligator does infrequently have a bony plate on its eyelid have caused &quot;Caigator sinensis&quot; to now be classified as a synonym of &quot;Alligator sinensis&quot;. There is still not a consensus among biologists that the American and Chinese alligators belong to the same genus, despite multiple studies comparing the biochemistry, histology, and various other aspects of the two crocodilians.

The evolutionary relationships of alligators can be shown in the cladogram below:
=== Etymology ===
The genus, &quot;Alligator&quot;, is based on the Spanish word . The specific name, &quot;sinensis&quot;, is from the Latin plural possessive , meaning &quot;belonging to China&quot;.

== Description ==
One of the smallest species of crocodilians, the Chinese alligator attains a length of and weight of as an adult. Females are roughly three-quarters the length of males. It is less than half the size of the American alligator, which typically grows to a length of for males and for females. Reports are known of alligators in China reaching in past centuries, but these are no longer thought to be accurate. The largest reported female measured and weighed , while the largest reported male measured and weighed .

The Chinese alligator is almost completely black or dark gray in color as an adult. It has a short and broad snout, which points slightly upwards and narrows at the end. Its head is robust, more so than that of the American alligator, with a bony septum dividing its nostrils. It has 72–76 teeth, of which 13–14 are maxillary, five premaxillary, and 18–19 mandibular. Four specimens measuring in length and weighing had a bite force of . Unlike the American alligator, the Chinese alligator is fully armored, including its belly. It contains up to 17 rows of scales across its body, which are soft on its belly and side and rougher on its back. Its upper eyelids have bony plates on them, a feature usually not present in the American alligator. Its tail is wider than that of the American alligator. It does not have webbed feet, in contrast to the American alligator, which has extensive webbing on its toes.

== Ecology ==
The Chinese alligator brumates in burrows during winter. After this period of dormancy, it frequently spends time in the sun before summer begins. It is nocturnal throughout summer, feeding at night and sheltering in the daytime, to avoid both humans and the summer heat. This behavior gives it the ability to live in areas where humans are common. A docile species, it generally does not intentionally hurt humans.

=== Burrowing ===
This alligator brumates from late October to mid-April, emerging in early May. It constructs its burrows next to ponds and other small bodies of water, using its head and front legs to dig into the ground. They can be large and complex, containing multiple rooms, water pools, and entrances. Most of them are long, with each room having enough space for alligators to turn around after entering. Outside of winter, the burrows serve as retreat sites for the alligators and in summer are where they take shelter in the daytime. The temperature inside them is never colder than . The burrows can be problematic for farmers, as they cause destruction of farm dykes.

=== Life cycle ===
The breeding season of the Chinese alligator is early summer, with the rate of mating being highest in mid-June. The alligator breeds earlier in the year if temperatures are higher. During the time of mating, males commonly search around ponds to find a mate and both male and female specimens are often aggressive to each other. The species exhibits polygamy, with single males mating with multiple females and/or a single female mating with several males. A study of 50 clutches showed multiple paternity in 60% of them, with up to three males contributing. Nests are typically built about 2–3 weeks after mating, from July to late August. Constructed by the females, they are composed of rotting plants, such as leaves, and are high. Females prefer to assemble them in areas that have a thick canopy and are far from human disturbance. Because islands frequently satisfy both of these conditions, they are often used as nesting sites. Nests are always near water sources. Individuals often return to the same nesting site yearly, although intraspecific competition and environmental changes can force them to change nesting sites.

Generally laid at night, mating typically produces 20–30 eggs, although according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), clutch size ranges between 10 and 40 eggs. After the eggs are laid, the females sometimes leave the nest, but other times stay to protect the eggs. The eggs are about in length, in diameter, and in weight, making them smaller than the eggs of any other crocodilian. They are typically incubated for about 70 days. On average, the temperature of incubation is , including the day and night. This temperature controls whether a young alligator will be male or female (temperature-dependent sex determination), a feature present in many other reptiles. A higher incubation temperature also increases the hatching rate. Young hatch in September, assisted by their mothers.

Newborn alligators, like their eggs, are the smallest of any crocodilian, with a length of and weight of . Unlike adults, they have light speckles on their bodies and heads. Mothers help them leave the nest and bring them to the water after hatching. They grow very little in their first year, due to being able to feed for only about 2 months after hatching before the winter. A 2002 study showed that the Chinese alligator is two-thirds the length of the American alligator and one-half its weight at birth, but is one-half its length and one-tenth its weight after one year. Young depend on their mothers to protect them during their first winter, as their small size makes them an easy prey target.

The alligator grows quickly in its first few years, with its growth rate slowing at age five. According to the National Zoological Park, females reach maturity roughly four to five years after birth, although other sources estimate that they mature at age six to seven. It can live to over 50 years, and has been known to reach age 70 in captivity. It cannot breed past its 50s.

=== Feeding ===
The Chinese alligator is an opportunistic feeder, meaning that it can prey on a variety of different animals depending on what is available. It is a carnivore, mostly eating fish and invertebrates, such as crustaceans, insects, mussels, clams, and snails. When possible, it eats rodents, other small mammals, and aquatic birds as well. It has dull teeth, which allow it to eat prey with shells more easily. There is some speculation that they may prey on turtles as well. A study of the alligator in 1985 showed that snails were the most common animal in its diet at 63%, with 65% of that being river snails and 35% spiral-shelled snails. According to the survey, its diet also contained 16% rabbits, 8.3% mollusks, and 4.1% shrimp, with the remaining 6.8% being frogs, fish, and insects.

=== Vocalization ===
The Chinese alligator is a vocal species, making many different sounds in multiple situations. When communicating with nearby alligators, it produces sounds such as head slapping, hissing, and whining, which have a low sound pressure level (SPL). To communicate long-distance, it produces bellows, which have a high SPL. All of these sounds have a low frequency of less than 500 hertz, due to the alligator&#x27;s densely vegetated habitat, which allow the sounds to spread across a greater area.

Both sexes participate in bellowing choruses during the mating season as adults. Lasting an average of 10 minutes, the alligators remain still for the entirety of the chorus, with both sexes responding equally in rough unison. The main purpose of these bellows is to call out to alligator specimens to collect at a specific pond, where individuals choose mates and engage in copulation. Alligators may also bellow to publicize their size, a behavior which occurs in multiple other vertebrates. The size of a specimen is a significant factor for mating; females only mate with males larger than themselves. Bellowing is most common at 6:00–7:00 am and 11:00–12:00 am CST. Although these bellows occur most frequently during the mating season, adults also bellow throughout the rest of the year.

Young Chinese alligators often communicate with each other and their parents using vocal signals to &quot;maintain group cohesion&quot;. Young also make sounds when in danger, which alert adults to help and caution nearby young of the threat. Embryos produce distinctive sounds inside their eggs, which alert the adult female that the nest is ready to be opened. These vocalizations are high-pitched, while their danger calls are louder.

== Distribution and population ==
The modern range of the Chinese alligator is extremely restricted. Historically, the alligator was widely distributed in the Yangtze river system. By the late 1980s, it was restricted to small ponds in six counties in the southeastern part of Anhui province; and since of 2015, the IUCN estimates the area of occupation at about . It is the only species in the family Alligatoridae that lives in the Eastern Hemisphere.

=== Habitat ===

The habitat of the Chinese alligator is bodies of fresh water, particularly wetlands and ponds, in areas transitioning between subtropical and temperate climates. It lives at the base of mountains, in areas where grass and shrubs are common. Habitat loss has also forced it to live at higher elevations than it prefers, where the weather is colder and the soil is unfit for burrow digging. Crocodilian conservationist John Thorbjarnarson observed a female who had to build her nest of pine needles rather than the usual plants; the eggs died due to the pine needles not being able to warm them properly.

=== Population and range trend ===
The oldest record of the Chinese alligator is a skeleton fragment found in western Japan. The fossil is estimated to be from the late Pliocene period, 3 million years ago (Mya). The skeleton showed that the species was larger at the time than it is currently, with a total length of at least . Alligators are believed to have moved into various parts of Japan either before 25 Mya or after 10 Mya and were extirpated from there during the Plio-Pleistocene period, due to Japan&#x27;s increased isolation from the continent and harsh climate conditions.

The population of the Chinese alligator began to decline in 5000 BC, when human civilization started to grow in China, after having been very abundant in the lower Yangtze area. This area was one of the first places in the world to farm rice, causing much of the alligator&#x27;s habitat to be destroyed in favor of rice farms. In the 1700s, much of the Chinese alligator&#x27;s habitat was replaced with farming fields after a large number of people had moved into the area. By the 20th century, its range was reduced to a few small areas around the Yangtze. In the 1950s, the alligator was in three distinct areas: the southern area of the Yangtze (Chang Jiang) from Pengze to the western shore of Lake Tai (Tai Hu), the mountainous regions of southern Anhui, and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, primarily in lakes, streams, and marshes. By the 1970s, it was restricted to small parts of southern Anhui and Zhejiang, at which time the population was about 1,000.

In 1998, the population of the Chinese alligator was the lowest it had ever been; the largest area it lived in was a small pond along the Yangtze surrounded by farmland, which held 11 alligators. In 1999, the Wildlife Conservation Society estimated that 130–150 individuals were left in the wild. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the population was less than 130 in 2001; at this time, alligators sometimes wandered around to look for a suitable habitat, but were unsuccessful due to their habitat having been turned into rice fields. In 2003, the population began to gradually increase after having been roughly stable between 1998 and 2003. A survey of the population by the Anhui National Nature Reserve for Chinese Alligator (ANNRCA) in 2005 deduced that between 92 and 114 adults and 66 young remained in the wild. The survey reasoned that the species&#x27; population was growing in four sites, but stable in the rest of the alligator&#x27;s range. A 2012 journal article estimated the population at the time to be 120–150. A 2015 survey observed 64 individuals, of which 32 were adults, estimating that the total number of adults was 68–86 and the total population 136–173. Wang Renping, the head of the ANNRCA, stated in 2017 that about 300 specimens existed in the wild, some of which had been born captive and reintroduced to the wild. As of 2018 the population is not considered to be further declining.
Due to the low wild population of the Chinese alligator, high inbreeding is a major concern threatening their chances for long-term survival.

=== Reasons for population decline ===
Considered to be one of the most endangered crocodilians in the world, the Chinese alligator&#x27;s biggest threats in the late 20th century were human killing and habitat loss. A majority of the species&#x27; wetland habitats were destroyed to construct rice paddies and dams. During the 1970s and 1980s, humans sometimes killed the alligators, because they believed they were pests, out of fear, or for their meat. Their meat was thought to have the ability to cure colds and prevent cancer and their organs were sold for medicinal purposes. In several restaurants and food centers in China&#x27;s more prosperous areas, young alligators were allowed to roam free with their mouths taped shut, and were subsequently killed for human consumption, served as a dish of rice, vegetables, and chopped up alligator flesh. In the late 20th century, people living in the range of the Chinese alligator ate its meat due to believing that it was dragon meat.

The Yangtze was flooded in the winter of 1957, which is believed to have caused many Chinese alligators to drown. Rats, which this species eat, have been poisoned by farmers, so were also a cause for the diminishing of the species. The organochlorine compound sodium pentachlorophenate was used to kill snails in agricultural fields starting in 1958, which incidentally poisoned the alligators as well. Other factors that led to the endangerment of the alligator include natural disasters and geographic separation.

== Status and conservation ==
In its native country, the Chinese alligator has been listed as a Class I endangered species since 1972, which gives it the highest possible degree of legal protection and makes killing or capturing the species in the wild forbidden. It is listed as a CITES Appendix I species and an endangered species by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. Following six assessments as endangered from 1982 to 1994, it is classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List as of 2017. In 1982, the Anhui National Nature Reserve for Chinese Alligator (ANNRCA) was created, a reserve spanning across the entire range of the Chinese alligator, now covering an area of .

=== In captivity ===

As of 2016, at least 20,000 Chinese alligators are living in captivity due to captive-breeding programs, the first initiated in the 1970s. Captive-born Chinese alligators have been reintroduced into their native range, boosting the wild population. Six specimens were released from captivity in 2007, followed by six more in June 2015. As of June 2016, the largest group of Chinese alligators to have been released in the wild was when 18 specimens were reintroduced to Langxi County, part of the species&#x27; native habitat, on May 22, 2016. These releases have proven successful, with individuals adapting well to a life in the wild and breeding. A year after the 2007 release, 16 young alligators were found living in the wild. 60 alligator eggs were observed in 2016, distributed in three nests at a wetland park. Although a typhoon in September the same year flooded and eliminated two of the nests, three hatchlings were found in the same area several days after.

==== China ====
The two largest breeding centers for the Chinese alligator are in, or near, the areas where Chinese alligators are still found in the wild. The Anhui Research Center for Chinese Alligator Reproduction (ARCCAR) is the largest of them, housing roughly 15,000 Chinese alligators as of 2016. The center is from the city of Xuancheng, where it makes use of a series of ponds in a small valley. Founded in 1979, the ARCCAR was stocked with 212 alligators collected from the wild over the first decade after its establishment, and received alligator eggs collected by the area&#x27;s residents and the ARCCAR&#x27;s own staff from the nests of wild alligators as well. In 1988, the first eggs by human-bred alligators were laid. The reserve decided to reintroduce some of its alligators in the wild in 2001, which was carried out in 2003 when three alligators were released. The alligator breeding was so successful that the ARCCAR began to use the alligators for local meat consumption and live animals for the European pet market, with the profits from these activities continuing to fund the breeding centers.

The other major breeding center for the species is the Changxing Chinese Alligator Nature Reserve (CCANR) or Changxing Nature Reserve and Breeding Center for Chinese Alligators (CNRBRCCA), in Changxing County, Zhejiang, about east of the ARCCAR. Originally known as the Yinjiabian Alligator Conservation Area (尹家边扬子鳄保护区), the breeding center was established in 1982. Unlike the ARCCAR, where alligator eggs are collected by the center&#x27;s staff for incubation in controlled condition, the CCANR allows eggs to hatch naturally. According to a 2013 official report, the CCANR housed almost 4,000 alligators, including 2,089 young (1–3 years old), 1,598 juveniles (4–12 years old), and 248 adults (13+ years old). By 2016, 5,500 specimens were housed at the center.

In 2003, the ARCCAR received a donation of $1.2 million from the State Forestry and Grassland Administration of China (SFGA) and $740,000 from the government of Anhui. This allowed the organization to create two new breeding areas to hold the alligators, each, as well as heighten the existing fence. The same year, the CCANR received a donation of $600,000 from the SFGA and $800,000 from the government of Changxing, enabling it to reinstate wetlands for the alligators and enhance its facilities. Both the ARCCAR and the CCANR position themselves as tourist attractions, where paying visitors can view alligators and learn about them.

Multiple other breeding facilities that house the Chinese alligator exist in various provinces of China, as well as private breeding farms and museums.

==== Foreign countries ====

The Chinese alligator is also kept and bred at many zoos and aquariums in North America and Europe. Some individuals bred there have been returned to China for reintroduction to the wild. The first time the alligators were ever transported internationally is believed to have been when several were taken from China to the United States in the 1950s. In November 2017, four Chinese alligators were transported from their natural habitat in China to Shizuoka, Japan.

Among the North American zoos and aquariums keeping this species are the Bronx Zoo, Cincinnati Zoo, Great Plains Zoo, Sedgwick County Zoo, Philadelphia Zoo, San Diego Zoo, Santa Barbara Zoo, Smithsonian National Zoological Park, and St. Louis Zoo. In Europe, about 25 zoos and aquariums keep the species, such as the Barcelona Zoo (Spain), Parque de las Ciencias (Granada)  (Spain), Bioparco di Roma (Italy), Crocodile Zoo (Denmark), Moscow Zoo (Russia), Pairi Daiza (Belgium), Paradise Wildlife Park (England), Parken Zoo (Sweden), Prague Zoo (Czech Republic), Tallinn Zoo (Estonia) and Tierpark Berlin (Germany).

== Chinese dragon association ==

Some writers have suggested that the Chinese alligator was the inspiration for the Chinese dragon. This theory was widespread in the early 1900s, and the idea was later revisited by John Thorbjarnarson and Xiaoming Wang. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the association with the &quot;beneficent&quot; mythological creature is an advantage for the species.

The Chinese dragon is portrayed as a symbol of &quot;royal power and good fortune&quot;, frequently helping and saving people. It is able to swim in water or air. The relatively harmless nature of the Chinese alligator is believed to have been an influence for the helpful nature of the dragon. The fact that the alligator ends its brumation when the rainy season begins and returns to its burrows when the rainwater in rivers recedes, as well as the fact that it lives in bodies of water, may be the reason for the dragon&#x27;s portrayal as a water-related mythological creature. Alligator drums may have been used to simulate the species&#x27; vocalizations during the mating season, which humans associated with the dragon&#x27;s &quot;power of summoning rainclouds&quot;.

<text>Whanganui Collegiate School (formerly Wanganui Collegiate School; see here) is a state-integrated, coeducational, day and boarding, secondary school in Whanganui, Manawatū-Whanganui region, New Zealand. The school is affiliated to the Anglican church.

== About ==
Whanganui Collegiate School was founded as Wanganui Collegiate School in 1854 thanks to a land grant in 1852 by the Governor of New Zealand, Sir George Grey, to the Bishop of New Zealand, George Augustus Selwyn, for the purpose of establishing a school.

Sir George Grey, during his times as governor in South Africa, Australia and New Zealand is also affiliated with the establishment of other educational institutions such as Auckland Grammar School in Auckland, New Zealand, Grey College in Bloemfontein, South Africa, and Grey High School in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

The school moved to its current site in 1911. It was originally a boys-only school but in 1991 began admitting girls at senior levels and went fully co-educational in 1999. The school celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2004.

St George’s School moved to the Collegiate campus in 2010. The combined schools provide primary education for day students on the St George’s campus, and secondary education for day and boarding students on the Collegiate campus.

Collegiate is an International Member of The Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference (HMC) which represents heads of the leading independent schools in Ireland, the United Kingdom and international schools mainly from the Commonwealth. Whanganui Collegiate is one of only three member schools in New Zealand.

Since 2019, Collegiate has been one of three Round Square schools in New Zealand along with King&#x27;s College and Christ&#x27;s College.

Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, spent two terms in 1982 at the school as a junior master during his gap year.

In November 2012, it was announced that the school would integrate into the state system effective January 2013, after requiring a $3.8 million bailout from the government to stay afloat.

In January 2019, the Whanganui Collegiate School Board of Trustees and Whanganui College Board of Trustees unanimously voted to add an &#x27;h&#x27; to the spelling of &#x27;Wanganui&#x27;, following other local organisations and secondary schools after the Whanganui District was similarly renamed in November 2015.

In mid-2023, it was announced that Whanganui Collegiate School would replace NCEA Level 1 with Cambridge IGCSE from 2024.

== School life ==
As a boarding school, the house system plays a significant role in student life. Each house (of which there are 6 in total; four for boys and two for girls) accommodates approximately 80 students, and each has its own Housemaster, Assistant Housemaster and Matron. The school houses are named Harvey which is named after Reverend B. W. (Bache Wright) Harvey, Hadfield which is named after Octavius Hadfield, Grey which is named after George Grey, Selwyn which is named after George Selwyn, Godwin and Bishops.

The school grounds also host numerous sporting facilities, including the Izard Gymnasium, High Performance Cricket Centre, a water surface hockey turf, a full-sized Cross Country Course and many team sports fields. The nearby Whanganui River is used by students for rowing training and competitions; rowing being one of the sports in which Collegiate has traditionally excelled, having won the Maadi Cup 17 times, a national record. The Collegiate women&#x27;s squad had a particularly strong year in 2006 when it won the most prestigious women&#x27;s race in the lower north Island, the Levin Jubilee Trophy, for the first time. Unfortunately, such success could not be replicated on the national stage, with the u18 girls eight only managing bronze in the penultimate race of the 2007 Maadi Cup. The school also hosts the nationally popular Whanganui Cricket Festival each year which sees over 1000 cricketers display their skills throughout the month of January.

Since 1925, the school&#x27;s &#x27;First XV&#x27; rugby team has played Christ&#x27;s College, Wellington College and Nelson College in an annual quadrangular rugby tournament, this Tournament is played at a different school every year playing at Collegiate once every four years. In recent times, this tournament has been dominated by Wellington College. Whanganui Collegiate last won in 1991.

Since 1994, The New Zealand Opera School has been hosted at Collegiate by Donald Trott.

<text>The Rektoratskirche St. Karl Borromäus, known as the , is a Baroque church in the Karlsplatz in Vienna, Austria. The church is dedicated to Saint Charles Borromeo, a leading figure of the Counter-Reformation.

Located on the border of Wieden and the Innere Stadt, the city centre, it is one of the most important Baroque churches north of the Alps and one of Vienna&#x27;s most popular landmarks.

== History ==
In 1713, one year after the last major plague epidemic in Vienna, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, pledged to build a church dedicated to his namesake patron saint, Charles Borromeo, who was revered as a healer for plague sufferers. An architectural competition was announced, in which Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach won over competitors including Ferdinando Galli-Bibiena and Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. Construction began in 1716 under the supervision of Anton Erhard Martinelli. After J.B. Fischer&#x27;s death in 1723, his son, Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach, completed the construction in 1737 with modifications to the original plans. The church originally possessed a direct line of sight to the Hofburg and was also, until 1918, the imperial patron parish church.

As a master of historic architecture, the elder Fischer von Erlach united the most diverse of elements. The façade in the centre, which leads to the porch, corresponds to a Greek temple portico. The two flanking columns, crafted by Lorenzo Mattielli, were inspired by Trajan&#x27;s Column in Rome. Next to those, two tower pavilions extend out and show the influence of the Roman baroque (Bernini and Borromini). Above the entrance, a dome rises up above a high drum, which the younger J.E. Fischer shortened and partly altered.

Adjacent to the church was the &quot;Spitaler Gottesacker&quot; cemetery. Composer Antonio Vivaldi was buried there on July 28, 1741, but his grave has been lost over time. The church hosts regular Vivaldi concerts in his honour.

Hedy Lamarr, then aged 19, married Friedrich Mandl, aged 32, a businessman and Austrofascist, in the chapel of the church on 10 August 1933. With over 200 prominent guests attending, Lamarr wore &quot;a black-and-white print dress&quot; and carried &quot;a bouquet of white orchids.&quot;

Since the restoration of Karlsplatz as an architectural ensemble in the late 1980s, the church has garnered fame because of its dome and its two flanking columns of bas-reliefs, as well as its role as an architectural counterweight to the buildings of the Musikverein and of the Vienna University of Technology. The church is cared for by the Knights of the Cross with the Red Star, and has long been the parish church and seat of the Catholic student ministry of the Vienna University of Technology.

==Iconography==
The iconographical program of the church originated from the imperial official Carl Gustav Heraeus and connects Saint Charles Borromeo with his imperial benefactor. The relief on the pediment above the entrance with the cardinal virtues and the figure of the patron on its apex point to the motivation of the donation. This sculpture group continues onto the attic story as well. The attic is also one of the elements which the younger Fischer introduced. The columns display scenes from the life of Charles Borromeo in a spiral relief and are intended to recall the two columns, Boaz and Jachim, that stood in front of the Temple at Jerusalem. They also recall the Pillars of Hercules and act as symbols of imperial power. The entrance is flanked by angels from the Old and New Testaments.

This program continues in the interior as well, above all in the dome fresco by Johann Michael Rottmayr of Salzburg and Gaetano Fanti, which displays an intercession of Charles Borromeo, supported by the Virgin Mary. Surrounding this scene are the cardinal virtues. The frescos in a number of side chapels are attributed to Daniel Gran.

The high altarpiece portraying the ascension of the saint was conceptualized by the elder Fischer and executed by Ferdinand Maxmilian Brokoff. The altar paintings in the side chapels are by various artists, including Daniel Gran, Sebastiano Ricci, Martino Altomonte and Jakob van Schuppen. A wooden statue of St. Anthony by Josef Josephu is also on display.

As strong effect emanates from the directing of light and architectural grouping, in particular the arch openings of the main axis. The color scheme is characterized by marble with sparring and conscious use of gold leaf. The large round glass window high above the main altar with the Hebrew Tetragrammaton/Yahweh symbolizes God&#x27;s omnipotence and simultaneously, through its warm yellow tone, God&#x27;s love. Below is a representation of Apotheosis of Saint Charles Borromeo.

Next to the structures at Schönbrunn Palace, which maintain this form but are more fragmented, the church is Fischer&#x27;s greatest work. It is also an expression of the Austrian &quot;joie de vivre&quot; stemming from the victorious end of the Turkish Wars.

==Pulpit==
The pulpit of the church was probably designed by Fischer von Erlach the Younger, and its execution may have been carried out by the French furniture maker Claude Le Fort du Plessy in 1735, although no surviving documents confirm their authorship or the construction of the church furniture. It is a wooden structure with rich floral, vegetal, rosette and rocaille ornaments, the finer carvings made of hard walnut, in a gold and brown colour scheme. The abat-voix forms a theatrical canopy, featuring two putti holding a cross and a chalice with a host, with a flaming urn at the top. Around 1860, the abat-voix was enlarged. A wide rim was added, distorting the original proportions, obscuring the elegant swirling lines, and creating a top-heavy effect. Between 2006 and 2007, this rim was removed after extensive debate, and the pulpit was restored. The missing canopy carvings were reconstructed, restoring the structure&#x27;s original appearance.

<text>The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) in charge of international health cooperation in the Americas. It fosters technical cooperation among member countries to fight communicable and noncommunicable diseases, strengthen health systems, and respond to emergencies and disasters. 

PAHO has 35 Member States and four Associate Members in the region. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., PAHO is the regional office for the World Health Organization in the Americas, and the health organization of the Inter-American System. It is known in Latin America as the OPS () or OPAS ().

== Description ==

PAHO has scientific and technical expertise at its headquarters, in its 27 country offices, and its three Pan American centers, all working with the countries of the americas in dealing with priority health issues. The health authorities of PAHO&#x27;s Member States set PAHO&#x27;s technical and administrative policies through its governing bodies. The PAHO Member States include all 35 countries in the Americas; Puerto Rico is an associate member. France, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are the participating states, and Portugal and Spain are the observer states.

The Organization&#x27;s mission is to strengthen national and local health systems and improve the health of the peoples of the Americas, in collaboration with Ministries of Health, other government and international agencies, nongovernmental organizations, universities, social security agencies, community groups, and many others.

PAHO promotes universal health coverage and universal access to health and strengthening of health systems based on primary health care strategies. It assists countries in fighting infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera, dengue, HIV and tuberculosis as well as the region&#x27;s growing epidemic of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. PAHO engages in technical cooperation with ministries of health and facilitates coordination with other sectors to promote health in all policies. PAHO also promotes the use of research evidence to inform health care decisions and policymaking through the implementation of knowledge translation strategies such as the Evidence-Informed Policy Network (EVIPNet). Through the Elimination Initiative, it targets HIV/AIDS.

Specific initiatives spearheaded by PAHO include the expanded program on immunization, which played a major role in the elimination of smallpox and polio from the Americas; the Tobacco-Free Americas initiative; the Regional Coalition for Water and Sanitation to Eliminate Cholera in Hispaniola; the Salt Smart Consortium; the Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization; and a blood safety initiative that seeks to improve blood safety and efficiency by helping countries reach 100% blood supplies from unpaid voluntary donors.

The Pan American approach is a part of PAHO history and the spirit of pan-americanism continues to stimulate technical cooperation among countries in health. PAHO has helped countries work together toward common goals, and to initiate multi-country health ventures in Central America, the Caribbean, the Andean Region, and the Southern Cone. Experience has shown practical benefits such as the solidarity that helped Central America after hurricane Mitch, and there are numerous other examples. Health collaboration found expression at the highest political level when American heads of state in their Summit in Santiago accepted a health initiative called &quot;Health Technology Linking the Americas&quot;.

The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean joined together over 20 years ago to buy vaccines through a revolving fund. These are among the Organization&#x27;s most notable successes, starting with the eradication of smallpox from the Americas in 1973, a triumph followed five years later by global eradication of the dreaded disease.

A major effort committing the Americas to embark on polio eradication in 1985 succeeded in September 1994, when a distinguished International Commission declared the Americas officially polio-free. The last case of polio in the Americas was identified on August 23, 1991, in a young boy named Luis Fermín Tenorio Cortez, in Junín, Peru. Since then, despite intensive surveillance, no cases of polio have been detected anywhere in the Americas, and the World Health Organization is now working toward the goal of eradicating polio globally. PAHO assists the countries in mobilizing the necessary resources to provide immunization and treatment services for all vaccine-preventable diseases. PAHO is close to accomplishing the goal of eliminating measles from this hemisphere and is pressing on with the introduction of new vaccines that are currently available, such as &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; B. to reduce meningitis and respiratory infections. PAHO works to reduce the toll of death and illness from diarrheal diseases, including cholera, through case management and oral rehydration therapy to prevent deaths from dehydration, and to provide adequate diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory infections, thus saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children each year.

The Organization provides technical collaboration in a variety of specialized public health fields and organizes emergency preparedness and disaster relief coordination. It supports efforts to strengthen national health systems, develop national health research systems, control malaria, Chagas&#x27; disease, urban rabies, leprosy, and other diseases that affect the people of the Americas. PAHO collaborates with governments, other agencies, and private groups to address major nutritional problems including protein-energy malnutrition, and is now working to eliminate iodine and vitamin A deficiencies.

PAHO engages in and facilitates health promotion to help countries deal with health problems typical of development and urbanization, especially non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, accidents, smoking, addiction to drugs and alcohol, and injuries among others. Beyond health promotion, PAHO also addresses health systems and quality of care issues in support of national efforts to respond to the NCD pandemic. The Organization also executes projects for other United Nations agencies, for international organizations such as the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, for official development cooperation agencies of various governments, and for philanthropic foundations.

The Organization recognizes the role of the private sector in the delivery of services and fosters dialogue and partnerships with the Ministries of Health. In addition to its core budget financed by quota contributions from its Member Governments, PAHO also seeks outside funding to help implement special programs and initiatives in response to vital health needs. Voluntary tax-deductible contributions for PAHO health and education projects in the Americas may be made to the PAHO Foundation.

Dr. Jarbas Barbosa of Brazil was elected as PAHO Director on September 28, 2022, and took office on January 31, 2023. PAHO&#x27;s Deputy Director is Dr. Mary Lou Valdez, of the United States, and the Assistant Director is Marcos Espinal, from the Dominican Republic.

==History==

The organization was founded in December 1902. It was originally called the Pan-American Sanitary Bureau. It has been described as the world&#x27;s first international public health organization.

In 1949, PAHO and WHO signed an agreement making PAHO the American Regional Office (AMRO) of WHO. Today the usual phrasing is &quot;Regional Office for the Americas&quot;. The first hemisphere-wide effort to eradicate smallpox was made in 1950 by the PAHO. The campaign was successful in eliminating smallpox from all countries of the Americas except Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador.

In October 2024, health authorities in the Americas expanded PAHO&#x27;s funding to help the Organization accelerate access to health technologies, particularly in response to public health emergencies and disease outbreaks.

==Headquarters building==

In March 1960, President Eisenhower signed into law a bill passed by the U.S. Congress authorizing the U.S. government to purchase and donate a lot for the PAHO headquarters in Washington, D.C. After a competitive bid, in October 1961, the PAHO declared Uruguayan architect Román Fresnedo Siri the winner of its competition. At the ceremony announcing him as a winner, the organization&#x27;s Director Abraham Horwitz said &quot;this beautiful building will become a monument to the ideal of better health for the peoples of the Americas.&quot; He described the winning design as one of &quot;both grace and utility&quot;, and said, &quot;it reflects the high ideals of the Pan-American spirit in an age when we must move ahead to build a better future for our peoples.&quot;

The building was designed in a modernist style. Constructed in 1965, the exterior features 29 round bronze seals of the founding nations of the Pan American Health Organization, designed by American sculptor Michael Lantz. In 1993 the seals were surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Save Outdoor Sculpture! program and were described as needing conservation treatment.

Constructed of reinforced concrete over a steel frame with an exterior of glass and marble, the building is one of Washington&#x27;s most recognized examples of midcentury modern architecture. The building is divided into two distinct volumes: a gracefully curved ten-story building that hosts the organization&#x27;s main offices, and an adjoining four-story cylindrical annex that serves as the congress hall for formal assemblies of the PAHO member state delegates, as well as other meetings and events. It is surrounded by George Washington University to the north and east, the Columbia Plaza office/residential complex to the west, and the State Department to the south across the E street expressway underpass.

<doc id="1246708" wikidata="Q7393660" url="?curid=1246708" title="SS Empire Rest">
<text>SS &quot;Empire Rest&quot; was a convoy rescue ship built for the Royal Navy during World War II, originally laid down as the &quot;Rayleigh Castle&quot;. Post-war she served as a transport ship until 1948, was sold in 1951, and scrapped in 1952.

==Design and description==
The Castle-class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding Flower class, enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The convoy rescue conversions had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a tonnage of . The ships were powered by a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The convoy rescue ships were given an armament of a single 12-pounder () anti-aircraft (AA) guns and five Oerlikon AA guns on single mounts.

==Construction and career==
The ship was ordered from Ferguson Brothers (Port Glasgow) Ltd. of Port Glasgow on 9 December 1942 as a Castle-class corvette. She was laid down in 1943 and launched on 19 June 1944 as &quot;Rayleigh Castle&quot; (K695), but further work was then cancelled, and she was completed as a convoy rescue ship on 26 October 1944. Under the ownership of the Ministry of War Transport, and managed by the Ellerman City Line, she sailed on eleven convoys between November 1944 and June 1945, but made no rescues. In November 1945 she sailed to Kiel to repatriate Royal Navy personnel, and was also employed as an transport ship in the Mediterranean in 1947, taking illegal Jewish immigrants from Haifa to internment camps on Cyprus in October that year.

In July 1948 she was laid up at Falmouth, Cornwall, and offered for sale in October 1949. She was eventually bought by Lloyds Albert Yard &amp; Motor Boat Packet Services Ltd. in October 1951. She arrived at Thos. W. Ward of Briton Ferry, Wales, for scrapping on 6 June 1952.

===Convoys===
&quot;Empire Rest&quot; sailed on the following convoys:

<text>The National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA), located in Washington, D.C., is &quot;the first museum in the world solely dedicated&quot; to championing women through the arts. NMWA was incorporated in 1981 by Wallace and Wilhelmina Holladay. Since opening in 1987, the museum has acquired a collection of more than 6,000 works by more than 1,000 artists, ranging from the 16th century to today. The collection includes works by Mary Cassatt, Alma Woodsey Thomas, Élisabeth Louise Vigée-LeBrun, and Amy Sherald. NMWA also holds the only painting by Frida Kahlo in Washington, D.C., &quot;Self-Portrait Dedicated to Leon Trotsky&quot;.

The museum occupies an old Masonic Temple, a building listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. In 2021 the museum temporarily closed to undergo a $66 million transformative renovation. The museum reopened to the public on October 21, 2023.

==History==
The museum was founded to reform traditional histories of art. It is dedicated to discovering and making known women artists who have been overlooked, erased, or unacknowledged, and assuring the place of women in contemporary art. The museum&#x27;s founder, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay, and her husband Wallace F. Holladay began collecting art in the 1960s, just as scholars were beginning to discuss the under-representation of women in museum collections and major art exhibitions.

Impressed by a 17th-century Flemish still life painting by Clara Peeters that they saw in Europe, they sought out information on Peeters and found that the definitive art history texts referenced neither her nor any other woman artist. They became committed to collecting artwork by women and eventually to creating a museum and research center.

The NMWA was incorporated in December 1981 as a private, non-profit museum, and the Holladay donation became the core of the institution&#x27;s permanent collection. After purchasing and extensively renovating a former Masonic Temple, NMWA opened in April 1987 with the inaugural exhibition &quot;American Women Artists, 1830–1930&quot;. 

To underscore its commitment to increasing the attention given to women in all disciplines, NMWA commissioned Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Ellen Taaffe Zwilich to write &quot;Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra&quot; inspired by five paintings from the permanent collection, for an opening concert. As of 2022, Director Susan Fisher Sterling heads a staff of more than 50 people.

===Building===
In 1983, NMWA purchased a landmark former Masonic temple in the Renaissance Revival style to house its works, under its first director Anne-Imelda Radice. After extensive renovations that included the addition of the two dramatic marble stairways linking the first floor and mezzanine, the museum opened to the public on April 7, 1987.

In November 1997, the Elisabeth A. Kasser Wing was opened, adding two new galleries, a larger museum shop, and a reception room. The entire facility is now 84,110 square feet (7,814 m2). 

The museum closed in August 2021 for a major renovation. Key improvements include enlarged gallery space, a new destination for researchers and education programs, enhanced amenities and accessibility for visitors as well as infrastructure and storage upgrades to improve the long-term conservation and security of the museum&#x27;s collection. Following the $66 million renovation, the museum reopened to the public on October 21, 2023. 

===Wilhelmina Cole Holladay===

Wilhelmina Cole Holladay was the founder and chair of the Board of the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Since her discovery that women artists have historically been omitted from collegiate art history texts, Wilhelmina Cole Holladay made it her mission to bring to the forefront the accomplishments of women through collecting, exhibiting and researching women artists of all nationalities and time periods.

Holladay created individual committees of over 1,000 volunteers from 27 states and seven countries, to give educational opportunities to children through collaborations with schools and other community groups, as well as provided opportunities for adults to participate and encourage art in local communities across the globe.

Wilhelmina Cole Holladay&#x27;s interest in art was sparked as a student at Elmira College in New York, where she studied art history, followed by graduate work at the University of Paris. She is listed in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who of American Women&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in American Art&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the World&quot;, and she held many honorary degrees and achievement awards for her work in the arts community. In 2006 she received the National Medal of Arts from the United States and the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; from the French government. In 2007 Holladay received the Gold Medal for the Arts from the National Arts Club in New York City. Holladay died on March 6, 2021, at her home in Washington, D.C. She was 98.

===New York Avenue Sculpture Project===

The museum sponsored a series of installations on New York Avenue in Washington, DC from 13th Street to 9th Street, in the heart of Mount Vernon Square. The point of the effort was to bring &quot;character&quot; to an area where &quot;there is a lot of good stuff going on,&quot; due to revitalization programs in the neighborhood.

Niki de Saint Phalle&#x27;s works, four in total, were the first in a series of installations. The installation of de Saint Phalle&#x27;s iconic pop art works was meant as a contrast to the traditional sculpture that graces the streets and squares of Washington. All five major median strips were made into &quot;sculpture islands,&quot; as described by National Museum of Women in the Art&#x27;s director Susan Fisher Sterling. Another inspiration for the project came from the lack of innovative contemporary art in Washington, encouraging the evolution of the area.

The project was sponsored by Medda Gudelsky, the D.C. Downtown B.I.D., the Philip L. Graham Fund, the Homer and Martha Gudelsky Family Foundation, members of the museum, and the D.C. Department of Transportation. The works remained up for one year.

==Collection==
The collection currently contains more than 4,500 works in a variety of styles and media, spanning from the 16th century to present day. Among the earliest works is Lavinia Fontana’s &quot;Portrait of a Noblewoman&quot;, ca. 1580. There are also a number of special collections, including 18th-century botanical prints, works by British and Irish women silversmiths from the 17th–19th centuries, and more than 1,000 unique and limited edition artists’ books.

Nearly 1,000 artists are represented, including Анна Абазиева, Magdalena Abakanowicz, Lynda Benglis, Rosa Bonheur, Chakaia Booker, Louise Bourgeois, Lola Alvarez Bravo, Rosalba Carriera, Mary Cassatt, Elizabeth Catlett, Judy Chicago, Camille Claudel, Louisa Courtauld, Petah Coyne, Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Elaine de Kooning, Lesley Dill, Helen Frankenthaler, Sonia Gechtoff, Marguerite Gérard, Nan Goldin, Nancy Graves, Grace Hartigan, Frida Kahlo, Angelica Kauffman, Käthe Kollwitz, Lee Krasner, Justine Kurland, Bettye Lane, Marie Laurencin, Hung Liu, Judith Leyster, Maria Martinez, Maria Sibylla Merian, Evelyn Metzger, Joan Mitchell, Gabriele Münter, Elizabeth Murray, Alice Neel, Louise Nevelson, Sarah Miriam Peale, Clara Peeters, Lilla Cabot Perry, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Mary Troby, Rachel Ruysch, Elisabetta Sirani, Joan Snyder, Lilly Martin Spencer, Alma Thomas, Suzanne Valadon, Amy Sherald, and Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun.

== Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center ==
The Betty Boyd Dettre Library and Research Center (LRC) provides researchers with information about women visual artists from all time periods and nationalities. It is open to scholars, students, researchers, curators, museum professionals, and the general public. The LRC collection includes 18,500 volumes of books and exhibition catalogues, 50 periodical titles, and research files on 18,000 individual women artists. These files include resumes, correspondence, reproductions, articles, and other ephemeral materials. The Arts and Entertainment Network Media Library holds approximately 500 videos, DVDs, audio tapes, and other audiovisual materials, including examples of video art, interviews with women artists, documentaries, and films directed by women.

Also available to researchers are The Nelleke Nix and Marianne Huber Collection: The Frida Kahlo Papers consists of more than 360 unpublished letters, postcards, notes, clippings, printed matter, and drawings relating to the artist&#x27;s life and work. The LRC also holds artist Judy Chicago’s visual archives.

In spring 2007, the LRC launched &quot;Clara: Database of Women Artists,&quot; a user-friendly searchable interface for biographic information on close to 18,000 historic and contemporary women artists from around the world. Since integrated within the NMWA web site, Clara has been decommissioned and is in the process of being moved.

<doc id="1246718" wikidata="Q1783121" url="?curid=1246718" title="Organic matter">
<text>Organic matter, organic material, or natural organic matter refers to the large source of carbon-based compounds found within natural and engineered, terrestrial, and aquatic environments. It is matter composed of organic compounds that have come from the feces and remains of organisms such as plants and animals. Organic molecules can also be made by chemical reactions that do not involve life. Basic structures are created from cellulose, tannin, cutin, and lignin, along with other various proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Organic matter is very important in the movement of nutrients in the environment and plays a role in water retention on the surface of the planet.

==Formation==
Living organisms are composed of organic compounds. In life, they secrete or excrete organic material into their environment, shed body parts such as leaves and roots and after organisms die, their bodies are broken down by bacterial and fungal action. Larger molecules of organic matter can be formed from the polymerization of different parts of already broken down matter. The composition of natural organic matter depends on its origin, transformation mode, age, and existing environment, thus its bio-physicochemical functions and properties vary with different environments.

==Natural ecosystem functions==
Organic matter is common throughout the ecosystem and is cycled through decomposition processes by soil microbial communities that are crucial for nutrient availability. After degrading and reacting, it can move into soil and mainstream water via waterflow. Organic matter provides nutrition to living organisms. Organic matter acts as a buffer in aqueous solutions to maintain a neutral pH in the environment. The buffer acting component has been proposed to be relevant for neutralizing acid rain.

==Source cycle==
Some organic matter not already in the soil comes from groundwater. When the groundwater saturates the soil or sediment around it, organic matter can freely move between the phases. Groundwater has its own sources of natural organic matter including:
* organic matter deposits, such as kerogen and coal.
* soil and sediment organic matter.
* organic matter infiltrating into the subsurface from rivers, lakes, and marine systems.&quot;

Organisms decompose into organic matter, which is then transported and recycled. Not all biomass migrates, some is rather stationary, turning only over the course of millions of years.

==Soil organic matter==

The organic matter in soil derives from plants, animals and microorganisms. In a forest, for example, leaf litter and woody materials fall to the forest floor. This is sometimes referred to as organic material. When it decays to the point in which it is no longer recognizable, it is called soil organic matter. When the organic matter has broken down into a stable substance that resists further decomposition it is called humus. Thus soil organic matter comprises all of the organic matter in the soil exclusive of the material that has not decayed.

An important property of soil organic matter is that it improves the capacity of a soil to hold water and nutrients, and allows their slow release, thereby improving the conditions for plant growth. Another advantage of humus is that it helps the soil to stick together which allows nematodes, or microscopic bacteria, to easily decay the nutrients in the soil.

There are several ways to quickly increase the amount of humus. Combining compost, plant or animal materials/waste, or green manure with soil will increase the amount of humus in the soil.
# Compost: decomposed organic material.
# Plant and animal material and waste: dead plants or plant waste such as leaves or bush and tree trimmings, or animal manure.
# Green manure: plants or plant material that is grown for the sole purpose of being incorporated with soil.

These three materials supply nematodes and bacteria with nutrients for them to thrive and produce more humus, which will give plants enough nutrients to survive and grow.

Soil organic matter is crucial to all ecology and to all agriculture, but it is especially emphasized in organic farming, where it is relied upon especially heavily.

===Priming effect===
The &quot;priming effect&quot; is characterized by intense changes in the natural process of soil organic matter (SOM) turnover, resulting from relatively moderate intervention with the soil. The phenomenon is generally caused by either pulsed or continuous changes to inputs of fresh organic matter (FOM). Priming effects usually result in an acceleration of mineralization due to a &quot;trigger&quot; such as the FOM inputs. The cause of this increase in decomposition has often been attributed to an increase in microbial activity resulting from higher energy and nutrient availability released from the FOM. After the input of FOM, specialized microorganisms are believed to grow quickly and only decompose this newly added organic matter. The turnover rate of SOM in these areas is at least one order of magnitude higher than the bulk soil.

Other soil treatments, besides organic matter inputs, which lead to this short-term change in turnover rates, include &quot;input of mineral fertilizer, exudation of organic substances by roots, mere mechanical treatment of soil or its drying and rewetting.&quot;

Priming effects can be either &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; depending on the reaction of the soil with the added substance. A positive priming effect results in the acceleration of mineralization while a negative priming effect results in immobilization, leading to N unavailability. Although most changes have been documented in C and N pools, the priming effect can also be found in phosphorus and sulfur, as well as other nutrients.

Löhnis was the first to discover the priming effect phenomenon in 1926 through his studies of green manure decomposition and its effects on legume plants in soil. He noticed that when adding fresh organic residues to the soil, it resulted in intensified mineralization by the humus N. It was not until 1953, though, that the term &quot;priming effect&quot; was given by Bingeman in his paper titled, &quot;The effect of the addition of organic material on the decomposition of an organic soil&quot;. Several other terms had been used before &quot;priming effect&quot; was coined, including priming action, added nitrogen interaction (ANI), extra N and additional N. Despite these early contributions, the concept of the priming effect was widely disregarded until about the 1980s-1990s.

The priming effect has been found in many different studies and is regarded as a common occurrence, appearing in most plant soil systems. However, the mechanisms which lead to the priming effect are more complex than originally thought, and still remain generally misunderstood.

Although there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the reason for the priming effect, a few &quot;undisputed facts&quot; have emerged from the collection of recent research:
# The priming effect can arise either instantaneously or very shortly (potentially days or weeks) after the addition of a substance is made to the soil.
# The priming effect is larger in soils that are rich in C and N as compared to those poor in these nutrients.
# Real priming effects have not been observed in sterile environments.
# The size of the priming effect increases as the amount of added treatment to the soil increases.

Recent findings suggest that the same priming effect mechanisms acting in soil systems may also be present in aquatic environments, which suggests a need for broader considerations of this phenomenon in the future.

==Decomposition==
One suitable definition of organic matter is biological material in the process of decaying or decomposing, such as humus. A closer look at the biological material in the process of decaying reveals so-called organic compounds (biological molecules) in the process of breaking up (disintegrating).

The main processes by which soil molecules disintegrate are by bacterial or fungal enzymatic catalysis. If bacteria or fungi were not present on Earth, the process of decomposition would have proceeded much slower.

Various factors impact the decomposition of organic matter including its chemical properties and other environmental parameters. Metabolic capabilities of the microbial communities play a crucial role on decomposition since they are highly connected with the energy availability and processing. In terrestrial ecosystems the energy status of soil organic matter has been shown to affect microbial substrate preferences. Some organic matter pools may be energetically favorable for the microbial communities resulting in their fast oxidation and decomposition, in comparison with other pools where microbial degraders get less return from the energy they invest. By extension, soil microorganisms preferentially mineralize high-energy organic matter, avoiding decomposing less energetically dense organic matter.

==Organic chemistry==
Measurements of organic matter generally measure only organic compounds or carbon, and so are only an approximation of the level of once living or decomposed matter. Some definitions of organic matter likewise only consider &quot;organic matter&quot; to refer to only the carbon content or organic compounds and do not consider the origins or decomposition of the matter. In this sense, not all organic compounds are created by living organisms, and living organisms do not only leave behind organic material. A clam&#x27;s shell, for example, while biotic, does not contain much organic carbon, so it may not be considered organic matter in this sense. Conversely, urea is one of many organic compounds that can be synthesized without any biological activity.

Organic matter is heterogeneous and very complex. Generally, organic matter, in terms of weight, is:
* 45–55% carbon
* 35–45% oxygen
* 3–5% hydrogen
* 1–4% nitrogen

The molecular weights of these compounds can vary drastically, depending on if they repolymerize or not, from 200 to 20,000 amu. Up to one-third of the carbon present is in aromatic compounds in which the carbon atoms form usually six-membered rings. These rings are very stable due to resonance stabilization, so they are challenging to break down. The aromatic rings are also susceptible to electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks from other electron-donating or electron-accepting material, which explains the possible polymerization to create larger molecules of organic matter.

Some reactions occur with organic matter and other materials in the soil to create compounds never seen before. Unfortunately, it is challenging to characterize these because so little is known about natural organic matter in the first place. Research is currently being done to determine more about these new compounds and how many are being formed.

==Aquatic==
Aquatic organic matter can be further divided into two components: (1) dissolved organic matter (DOM), measured as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) or dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and (2) particulate organic matter (POM). They are typically differentiated by that which can pass through a 0.45 micrometre filter (DOM), and that which cannot (POM).

===Detection===
Organic matter is important in water and wastewater treatment and recycling, natural aquatic ecosystems, aquaculture, and environmental rehabilitation. It is, therefore, important to have reliable methods of detection and characterisation, for both short- and long-term monitoring. Various analytical detection methods for organic matter have existed for up to decades to describe and characterise organic matter. These include, but are not limited to: total and dissolved organic carbon, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, UV-Visible spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Each of these methods has its advantages and limitations.

===Water purification===
The same capability of natural organic matter that helps with water retention in the soil creates problems for current water purification methods. In water, organic matter can still bind to metal ions and minerals. The purification process does not necessarily stop these bound molecules but does not cause harm to any humans, animals, or plants. However, because of the high reactivity of organic matter, by-products that do not contain nutrients can be made. These by-products can induce biofouling, which essentially clogs water filtration systems in water purification facilities, as the by-products are larger than membrane pore sizes. This clogging problem can be treated by chlorine disinfection (chlorination), which can break down residual material that clogs systems. However, chlorination can form disinfection by-products.

Water with organic matter can be disinfected with ozone-initiated radical reactions. The ozone (three oxygens) has powerful oxidation characteristics. It can form hydroxyl radicals (OH) when it decomposes, which will react with the organic matter to shut down the problem of biofouling.

==Vitalism==

The equation of &quot;organic&quot; with living organisms comes from the now-abandoned idea of vitalism, which attributed a special force to life that alone could create organic substances. This idea was first questioned after Friedrich Wöhler artificially synthesized urea in 1828.

<text>The Battle of Cowpens was a military engagement during the American Revolutionary War fought on January 17, 1781, near the town of Cowpens, South Carolina. American Patriot forces, estimated at 2,000 militia and regulars under Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, faced 1,000 British troops under Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton.

The American victory was the worst loss suffered by British units since General John Burgoyne surrendered to General Horatio Gates at Saratoga in 1777. The British campaigned southward because of higher British support, or Toryism, in the south, however pro-independence enthusiasm surged when news of the battle spread. Tactically, Cowpens demonstrated that American Patriot militia, when properly led, could inflict heavy casualties on Britain&#x27;s best-trained troops.

Morgan&#x27;s militia disbanded after the battle, leaving 550 soldiers under his command. British General Charles Cornwallis pursued Morgan during December 1780 and January 1781 with his army of 2,500 men. Morgan evaded Cornwallis and joined General Nathanael Greene’s army near Greensboro, North Carolina, in early February, setting the stage for the Battle of Guilford Court House.

==Background==
On October 14, 1780, Continental Army commander General George Washington chose Nathanael Greene, a Rhode Island Quaker officer, to be commander of the Southern Department of the Continental forces. Greene&#x27;s task was not an easy one. In 1780 the Carolinas had been the scene of a long string of disasters for the Continental Army, the worst being the capture of one American army under General Benjamin Lincoln in May 1780 at the siege of Charleston. The British then occupied the city, the largest in the South and the capital of South Carolina. Later that year, a Colonial army commanded by General Horatio Gates was defeated at the Battle of Camden. A victory of colonial militia over their Loyalist counterparts at the Battle of Kings Mountain on the northwest frontier in October had bought time, but the British still occupied most of South Carolina. When Greene took command, the southern army numbered 2,307 men on paper (1,482 present), of whom 949 were Continental regulars, mostly of the famous and highly trained &quot;Maryland Line&quot; regiment.

On December 3, Brigadier General Daniel Morgan reported for duty to Greene&#x27;s headquarters at Charlotte, North Carolina. At the start of the American Revolution, Morgan—whose military experience dated to the French and Indian War (1754–1763)—had served at the siege of Boston in 1775. Later he participated in the 1775 invasion of Canada and its climactic battle, the Battle of Quebec. That battle ended in defeat and Morgan&#x27;s capture by the British. Morgan was exchanged in January 1777 and placed by Washington in command of a picked force of 500 trained riflemen, known as Morgan&#x27;s Riflemen. Morgan and his men played a key role in the 1777 victory at Saratoga, which proved to be a turning point of the entire war. Bitter after being passed over for promotion and plagued by severe attacks of sciatica, Morgan left the army in 1779. A year later, he was promoted to brigadier general and returned to service in the Southern Department.

Greene decided that his weak army could not meet the British in a stand-up fight. He made the unconventional decision to divide his army, sending a detachment west of the Catawba River to raise the morale of the locals and find supplies beyond the limited amounts available around Charlotte. Greene gave Morgan command of this wing and instructed him to join with the militia west of the Catawba and take command of them. Morgan headed west on December 21, charged with taking position between the Broad and Pacolet rivers and protecting the civilians in that area. He had 600 men, some 400 of whom were Continentals, mostly from Delaware and Maryland. The rest were Virginia militia who had experience as Continentals. By Christmas Day, Morgan had reached the Pacolet. He was joined by 60 more South Carolina militiamen led by the experienced guerrilla partisan Andrew Pickens. Other militia from Georgia and the Carolinas joined Morgan&#x27;s camp.

Meanwhile, Lord Cornwallis was planning to return to North Carolina and conduct the invasion that he had postponed after the defeat at Kings Mountain. Morgan&#x27;s force represented a threat to his left. Additionally, Cornwallis received incorrect intelligence claiming that Morgan was going to attack the important British fort of American Loyalists at Ninety Six, South Carolina. Seeking to save the fort and defeat Morgan&#x27;s command, Cornwallis on January 1, 1781, with a follow-up message on January 2 ordered cavalry (dragoons) commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton to the west.
Tarleton was 26 years old and had enjoyed a spectacular career in his service with the British in the colonies. In December 1776, he and a small party surprised and captured Colonial General Charles Lee in New Jersey. He served with distinction at the siege of Charleston and the Battle of Camden. Commanding the British Legion—a mixed infantry/cavalry force composed of American Loyalists who constituted some of the best British troops in the Carolinas—Tarleton won victories at Monck&#x27;s Corner and Fishing Creek. He became infamous among colonists after his victory at the Battle of Waxhaws, where his men had killed American soldiers after they had surrendered. In Tarleton&#x27;s account published in the British Isles in 1781, he said that his horse had been shot from under him during the initial charge and his men, thinking him dead, engaged in &quot;a vindictive asperity not easily restrained&quot;.

Tarleton and the Legion marched to Ninety Six. After learning Morgan was not there, Tarleton asked for reinforcements of British regulars, which Cornwallis sent. Tarleton set out with his enlarged command to drive Morgan across the Broad River. On January 12 he received accurate news of Morgan&#x27;s location and continued with hard marching, building boats to cross rivers that were flooding with winter rains. Receiving word that Tarleton was in hot pursuit, Morgan retreated north to avoid being trapped between Tarleton and Cornwallis.

By the afternoon of January 16, Morgan was approaching the Broad River, which was high with flood waters and reported difficult to cross. He knew Tarleton was close behind. By nightfall, he had reached a place called locally &quot;Hannah&#x27;s Cowpens&quot;, a well-known grazing area for local cattle. Pickens, who had been patrolling, arrived that night to join Morgan with his large body of irregular militia. Morgan decided to stand and fight rather than continue to retreat and risk being caught by Tarleton while fording the Broad. Learning of Morgan&#x27;s location, Tarleton pushed his troops, marching at 3 a.m. instead of camping for the night.

==Prelude==

===Continental force===
The size of the American force at Cowpens remains in dispute. Morgan claims in his official report to have had about 800 men at Cowpens, which is substantially supported by historian John Buchanan, whose estimate is between 800 and 1,000 men. In contrast, historian Lawrence E. Babits in his detailed study of the battle offers an alternate estimate, contending that the strength of Morgan&#x27;s command on the day of the battle was closer to 1,900, composed of:
*A battalion of Continental infantry under Lieutenant Colonel John Eager Howard of Baltimore, with one company from Delaware (&quot;Delaware Line&quot;), one from Virginia, and three from the famous stalwart &quot;Maryland Line&quot; regiment, each with a strength of 60 men (300)
*A company of Virginia state militia troops under Captain John Lawson (75)
*A company of South Carolina state troops under Captain Joseph Pickens (60)
*A small company of North Carolina state troops under Captain Henry Connelly (number not given)
*A Virginia militia battalion under Frank Triplett (160)
*Three companies of Virginia militia under Major David Campbell (50)
*A battalion of North Carolina militia under Colonel Joseph McDowell (260–285)
*A brigade of four battalions of South Carolina militia under Colonel Andrew Pickens, comprising a three-company battalion of the Spartan Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Roebuck, a four-company battalion of the Spartan Regiment under Colonel John Thomas, five companies of the Little River Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Hayes, and seven companies of the Fair Forest Regiment under Colonel Thomas Brandon. Babits states that this battalion &quot;ranged in size from 120 to more than 250 men&quot;. If Roebuck&#x27;s three companies numbered 120 and Brandon&#x27;s seven companies numbered 250, then Thomas&#x27;s four companies probably numbered about 160 and Hayes&#x27;s five companies about 200, for a total of 730.
*Three small companies of Georgia militia commanded by Major Cunningham who numbered 55
*A detachment of the 1st and 3rd Continental Light Dragoons under Lieutenant Colonel William Washington (82), who was a second cousin of George Washington.
*Detachments of state dragoons from North Carolina and Virginia (30)
*A detachment of South Carolina state dragoons, with a few mounted Georgians, commanded by Major James McCall (25)
*A company of newly raised volunteers from the local South Carolina militia commanded by Major Benjamin Jolly (45)

Babits&#x27;s figures can be summarized as follows: 82 Continental light dragoons, 55 state dragoons, 45 militia dragoons, 300 Continental infantry, about 150 state infantry, and 1,255–1,280 militia infantry, for a total of 1,887–1,912 officers and men. Broken down by state, there were about 855 South Carolinians, 442 Virginians, 290–315 North Carolinians, 180 Marylanders, 60 Georgians, and 60 Delawareans.

Morgan&#x27;s forces were strengthened by these core elements of relatively seasoned troops. His Continentals were veterans (Marylanders from the 1776 Battle of Brooklyn), as were many of his militia, which included some Overmountain Men who had fought at the Battle of Musgrove Mill and the Battle of Kings Mountain. The experienced British forces (and particularly their relatively young commander) were accustomed, especially in the Southern Theater, to easily routing often &quot;green&quot; militia, and could have underestimated the opposition.

===British force===
Tarleton&#x27;s force included:
*The British Legion: 250 cavalry and 200 infantry,
*A troop of the 17th Light Dragoons (50),
*A battery of the Royal Artillery (24) with two 3-pounder cannons
*7th Regiment of Foot (Royal Fusiliers) (177)
*Light infantry company of the 16th Regiment of Foot (42)
*71st Regiment of Foot (Fraser&#x27;s Highlanders) under Major Arthur MacArthur (334)
*Light company of the Loyalist Prince of Wales&#x27;s American Regiment (31)
*A company of Loyalist guides (50)
A total of over 1,150 officers and men.

Broken down by troop classification, there were 300 cavalry, 553 regulars, 231 provincials, 24 artillerymen, and 50 militia. From these numbers, nearly half of Tarleton&#x27;s force were Provincial troops recruited from the Loyalist population of the colonies (481 out of 1,158). Tarleton&#x27;s regular troops from the Royal Artillery, 17th Light Dragoons, and the 7th, 16th, and 71st Regiments of Foot were reliable and seasoned soldiers. Tarleton&#x27;s own Provincial unit, the British Legion, had established a fierce reputation as formidable pursuers, being used to great effect at Waxhaws and Camden, but they had an uncertain reputation when facing determined opposition.

===Morgan&#x27;s plan===
Morgan turned to his advantage the terrain of Cowpens, the varying reliability of his troops, his expectations of his opponent, and the time available before Tarleton&#x27;s arrival. He knew that untrained militiamen, which comprised a large portion of his force, were generally unreliable in a pitched battle. In the past, they had routed at the first hint of defeat and abandoned the regulars. For instance, the Battle of Camden had ended in disaster when the militia, which comprised half of the American force, broke and ran as soon as the fighting started, leaving the American flank exposed. To eliminate that possibility, he defied convention by placing his army between the Broad and Pacolet rivers, thus making escape impossible if the army was routed. Selecting a low hill as the center of his position, he placed his Continental infantry on it, deliberately leaving his flanks exposed to his opponent. With a ravine on their right flank and a creek on their left flank, Morgan reasoned his forces were sufficiently protected against possible British flanking maneuvers at the beginning of the battle.

Morgan surmised that Tarleton would be highly confident and attack him head-on, without pausing to devise a more subtle plan. He therefore arranged his forces to encourage this presupposed impetuosity of his opponent by establishing three lines of soldiers: one of sharpshooters, one of militia, and a main line of regulars and experienced militia. The first line was composed of 150 select riflemen from North Carolina (under McDowell) and Georgia (under Cunningham). The second line consisted of 300 militiamen under the command of Pickens. The effect was the conspicuous placement of weak militia in the center-front in order to encourage Tarleton to attack there. The skirmishers and militia would screen the veteran Continental regulars while inflicting casualties as the British advanced. Morgan asked the militia to fire two volleys, something they could do, and then withdraw to the left and re-form in the rear behind the third line, under the cover of reserve light dragoons commanded by Washington and McCall. The withdrawal of the militia was in effect a feigned retreat which would further embolden Tarleton. The third line, on the hill, was manned by Morgan&#x27;s most seasoned troops: around 550 Continental regulars including the Maryland Line and Delaware Line, supported by experienced militiamen from Georgia and Virginia. Howard commanded the Continental regulars, while Tate and Triplett commanded the experienced militia. The third line could be expected to stand and hold against the British force. Morgan expected that the British advance uphill would be disorganized, weakened both physically and psychologically by the first two lines, before engaging the third. The third line would also withdraw a short distance to add to the appearance of a rout.

Morgan, in arranging his battle lines at Cowpens, proposed &quot;to turn a weakness into a strength&quot; according to historian Alan Pell Crawford. Anticipating the tendency for militia units to break ranks in the face of British bayonet charges, Morgan made a virtue out of a vice: &quot;His plan is studied to this day.&quot; In developing his tactics at Cowpens, as historian John Buchanan wrote, Morgan may have been &quot;the only general in the American Revolution, on either side, to produce a significant original tactical thought&quot;.

===Tarleton&#x27;s approach===
At 2:00 a.m. on January 17 Tarleton roused his troops and continued his march to Cowpens. Babits states &quot;in the five days before Cowpens, the British were subjected to stress that could only be alleviated by rest and proper diet. ...In the forty-eight hours before the battle, the British ran out of food and had less than four hours&#x27; sleep&quot;. Over the whole period, Tarleton&#x27;s brigade did a great deal of rapid marching across difficult terrain. Babits concludes that they reached the battlefield exhausted and malnourished. Tarleton sensed victory, and nothing would persuade him to delay. His Tory scouts had told him of the countryside Morgan was fighting on, and he was certain of success because Morgan&#x27;s soldiers, mostly militiamen, seemed to be caught between mostly experienced British troops and a flooding river. As soon as he reached the spot, Tarleton formed a battle line, which consisted of dragoons on his flanks, with his two grasshopper cannons in between the British Regulars and American Loyalists.

Tarleton&#x27;s plan was simple and direct. Most of his infantry (including that of the Legion) would be assembled in linear formation and move directly upon Morgan. The right and left flanks of this line would be protected by dragoon units. In reserve was the 250-man battalion of 71st Highlanders commanded by MacArthur, a professional soldier of long experience who had served in the Dutch Scotch Brigade. Tarleton kept his 200-man cavalry contingent of his Legion ready to be unleashed when the Americans broke and ran.

==Battle==


=== British attack ===
A few minutes before sunrise, Tarleton&#x27;s vanguard emerged from the woods in front of the American position. Tarleton ordered his dragoons to attack the first line of skirmishers, who opened fire and shot 15 dragoons. When the dragoons promptly retreated, he immediately ordered an infantry charge, without pausing to study the American deployment or to allow the rest of his infantry and his cavalry reserve to make it out of the woods. Tarleton attacked the skirmish line without pausing, deploying his main body and his two grasshopper cannons. The American skirmishers kept firing as they withdrew to join the second line manned by Pickens&#x27;s irregular militia. The British attacked again, this time reaching the militiamen, who (as ordered) poured two volleys into the enemy, especially targeting commanders. The British—with 40% of their casualties being officers—were astonished and confused. They reorganized and continued to advance. Tarleton ordered one of his officers, Ogilvie, to charge with some dragoons into the &quot;defeated&quot; Americans. His men moved forward in regular formation and were momentarily paused by the militia musket fire but continued to advance. Pickens&#x27;s militia seemed to &quot;flee&quot; as usual, around the American left to the rear as planned after getting off their second volley.

Taking the withdrawal of the first two lines as a full-blown retreat, the British advanced headlong into the third and final line of disciplined Maryland and Delaware regulars which awaited them on the hill. The 71st Highlanders were ordered to flank the American right. Howard spotted the flanking movement and ordered the Virginia militiamen manning the American right to turn and face the Scots. However, in the noise of battle, Howard&#x27;s order was misunderstood, and the militiamen began to withdraw. It was now 7:45 am, and the British had been fighting for nearly an hour. They were tired and disorganized, but they saw the Virginia militia on the rebels&#x27; right withdrawing and believed the Americans were on the run. They charged, breaking formation and advancing in a chaotic mass. 

=== Patriot counterattack ===
Morgan ordered a volley. Howard&#x27;s &quot;fleeing&quot; militia suddenly stopped their withdrawal and made an about-face. The Virginians fired into the British at a range of no more than 30 yards, with massive effect, causing the confused British to lurch to a halt. Howard shouted, &quot;Charge bayonets!&quot; The Continentals in the center, as ordered, mounted a bayonet charge. Tarleton&#x27;s force, faced with a terrible surprise, began to collapse; some men surrendering on the spot, while others turned and ran. Howard&#x27;s men charged forward and seized the two British grasshopper cannons. Washington&#x27;s cavalry came around from behind the opposite American left to hit the British on their right flank and rear. Pickens&#x27;s militia, having now reorganized, charged out from behind the hill, completing a 360-degree circle around the American position to hit the 71st Highlanders on the British left flank and rear. Howard ordered the Virginia militia, whose withdrawal had brought on the British ill-fated charge, to turn about and attack the Scots from the other direction.

The shock of the sudden charge, coupled with the reappearance of the American militiamen on the left flank where Tarleton&#x27;s exhausted men expected to see their own cavalry, proved too much for the British. Nearly half of the British and Loyalist infantrymen fell to the ground whether they were wounded or not. Their will to fight was gone. Babits diagnoses &quot;combat shock&quot; as the cause for this abrupt British collapse—the effects of exhaustion, hunger, and demoralization suddenly catching up with them. Caught in a double envelopment that has been compared with the Battle of Cannae in ancient times, many of the British surrendered.

When Tarleton&#x27;s right flank and center line collapsed, only a minority of the 71st Highlanders were putting up a fight against part of Howard&#x27;s line. Tarleton, realizing how desperate his situation was, rode back to his sole remaining intact unit, the British Legion cavalry. He ordered them to charge, but they instead fled the field. The Highlanders, surrounded by militia and Continentals, surrendered. Desperate to save something, Tarleton found about 40 cavalrymen and with them tried to retrieve his two cannons, but they had been captured, and he too retreated from the field. Although their charge was initially effective, the dragoons, numbering about 50, were quickly surprised and outnumbered by Washington&#x27;s concealed cavalry, and they were driven back in disarray. 

Washington was in close pursuit of the retreating Tarleton and found himself somewhat isolated. He was attacked by the British commander and two of his men. Tarleton was stopped by Washington, who attacked him with his sword, calling out, &quot;Where is now the boasting, Tarleton?&quot; A cornet of the 17th Light Dragoons, Thomas Patterson, rode up to strike Washington but was shot by Washington&#x27;s orderly trumpeter. Washington had broken his sword off near the handguard while slashing at an officer near Tarleton who was then shot by the orderly. Sergeant Major Perry deflected the saber of the other British officer and wounded him, saving Washington&#x27;s life Washington survived this assault and in the process wounded Tarleton on his right hand with a sabre blow, while Tarleton creased Washington&#x27;s knee with a pistol shot that also wounded his horse.

It was now 8:00 a.m., and the battle had lasted approximately one hour. Washington pursued Tarleton for 16 miles but gave up the chase when he came to the plantation of local planter Adam Goudylock near Thicketty Creek. Tarleton was able to escape capture by forcing Goudylock to serve as guide.

==Aftermath==

Morgan&#x27;s army took 712 prisoners, which included 200 wounded. Even worse for the British, the loss (especially the British regulars and the dragoons) constituted the best of Cornwallis&#x27;s army. Additionally, 110 British soldiers were killed in action, and every artilleryman was either killed or incapacitated by wounds. Tarleton suffered an 86 percent casualty rate, and his brigade had been wiped out as a fighting force. Howard quoted McArthur of the 71st Highlanders, now a prisoner of the Americans, as saying &quot;he was an officer before Tarleton was born; that the best troops in the service were put under &#x27;that boy&#x27; to be sacrificed.&quot; An American prisoner later recounted that when Tarleton reached Cornwallis and reported the disaster, Cornwallis placed his sword tip on the ground and leaned on it until the blade snapped.

Babits has demonstrated that Morgan&#x27;s official report of 73 casualties appears to have only included his Continental troops. From surviving records, Babits identifed by name 128 Colonial soldiers who were either killed or wounded at Cowpens. He also presents an entry in the North Carolina state records that shows 68 Continental and 80 militia casualties. It would appear that both the number of Morgan&#x27;s casualties and the total strength of his force were about double what he officially reported.

Tarleton&#x27;s apparent recklessness in pushing his command so hard in pursuit of Morgan may be explained by the fact that, up until Cowpens, every battle that he and his British Legion had fought in the South had been a relatively easy victory. He appears to have been so concerned with pursuing Morgan that he quite forgot that it was necessary for his men to be in a fit condition to fight once they caught him, though Cornwallis did press Tarleton to take aggressive action.

Coming in the wake of the American debacle at Camden, Cowpens was a surprising victory and a turning point that affected the psychology of the entire war—&quot;spiriting up the people&quot;, not only those of the backcountry Carolinas, but those in all the Southern states. As it was, the Americans were encouraged to fight further, and the Loyalists and British were demoralized. Furthermore, its strategic result—the destruction of an important part of the British army in the South—was crucial toward ending the war. Along with the British defeat at Kings Mountain, Cowpens was a serious blow to Cornwallis, who might have defeated much of the remaining resistance in South Carolina had Tarleton won at Cowpens. Instead, the battle set in motion a series of events leading to the end of the war. Cornwallis abandoned his pacification efforts in South Carolina, stripped his army of its excess baggage, and pursued Greene&#x27;s force into North Carolina. Skirmishes occurred at the Catawba River (Battle of Cowan&#x27;s Ford on February 1, 1781) and other fords. Yet, after a long chase Cornwallis met Greene at the Battle of Guilford Court House, winning a victory but so weakening his army that he withdrew to Wilmington to rest and refit. Later, when Cornwallis went into Virginia, Washington and his French ally Rochambeau, seized this opportunity to trap and defeat him in the Battle of Yorktown, which caused the British to give up their efforts to defeat the Americans.
In the opinion of John Marshall, &quot;Seldom has a battle, in which greater numbers were not engaged, been so important in its consequences as that of Cowpens.&quot; It gave Greene his chance to conduct a campaign of &quot;dazzling shiftiness&quot; that led Cornwallis by &quot;an unbroken chain of consequences to the catastrophe at Yorktown which finally separated America from the British crown&quot;.

<text>Atacamite is a copper halide mineral: a copper(II) chloride hydroxide with formula Cu2Cl(OH)3. It was first described for deposits in the Atacama Desert of Chile in 1802 by Dmitri de Gallitzin. The Atacama Desert is also the namesake of the mineral.

== Occurrence ==
Atacamite is polymorphous with botallackite, clinoatacamite, and paratacamite. Atacamite is a comparatively rare mineral, formed from primary copper minerals in the oxidation or weathering zone of arid climates. It has also been reported as a volcanic sublimate from fumarole deposits, as sulfide alteration products in black smokers. The mineral has also been found naturally on oxidized copper deposits in Chile, China, Russia, Czech Republic, Arizona, and Australia. It occurs in association with cuprite, brochantite, linarite, caledonite, malachite, chrysocolla and its polymorphs.

=== Synthetic Occurrence ===
Atacamite has been discovered in the patina of the Statue of Liberty, and as alteration of ancient bronze and copper artifacts. The mineral has been found as a pigment in sculpture, manuscripts, maps, and frescoes discovered in Eurasia, Russia, and Persia.

=== Biomineral === 
Atacamite occurs as a biomineral in the jaws of bloodworms.

<text>B&#x27;wana Beast (Michael Payson &quot;Mike&quot; Maxwell) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is an African-themed hero who can communicate with and fuse animals.

B&#x27;wana Beast has also appeared in various media outside comics. Kevin Michael Richardson and Peter Onorati voice the character in &quot;&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; respectively.

==Publication history==
Created by Bob Haney and Mike Sekowsky, B&#x27;wana Beast made his first appearance in &quot;Showcase&quot; #66 (January 1967).
The character was an attempt to capitalize on Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; Tarzan, borrowing the African jungle setting and &quot;Tarzan yell&quot; which was created in the Johnny Weissmuller incarnation of Tarzan.

==Fictional character biography==
Michael Maxwell is a ranger in Zambezi&#x27;s nature preserves who crashes on Mount Kilimanjaro after his plane is struck by lightning. He and his companions take refuge in the cavern home of Djuba, a mutant red gorilla. After drinking the cavern&#x27;s mineral-rich water, Maxwell gains superhuman strength and defeats Djuba.

Acknowledging Maxwell as its master, Djuba gives him a mystical helmet that enables him to communicate with and fuse animals. Later, S.T.A.R. Labs scientists infect B&#x27;wana Beast and Djuba with anthrax. Djuba dies, but Animal Man cures B&#x27;wana Beast by enhancing his immune system. In &quot;Animal Man&quot; #13 (July 1989), Maxwell retires and gives his helmet and elixir to South African activist Dominic Mndawe, who becomes Freedom Beast.

Mike Maxwell returns in &quot;Animal Man&quot; #47 (May 1992), where the Antagon entity possesses him and transforms him into Shining Man. He wreaks havoc on Earth before being killed in a fight with Metaman.

In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, B&#x27;wana Beast is a rejected Justice League International applicant whose abilities are derived from the Red, a mystical force connecting animal life.

==Powers and abilities==
B&#x27;wana Beast drinks an elixir that gives him superhuman strength, speed, hunting and tracking abilities. He also wears an ancient helmet that allows him to communicate with animals and merge them to form Chimeras.

<doc id="1246738" wikidata="Q2916933" url="?curid=1246738" title="Pinus remota">
<text>Pinus remota, commonly known as the Texas pinyon or papershell pinyon, is a pine in the pinyon pine group, native to southwestern Texas and northeastern Mexico. It can be distinguished from other pinyon species by its thin-walled seeds, which made it especially attractive as a food to Indians and Mexicans living where it grew. Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca noted that the papershell pinon was an important food for the Indians in 1536.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus remota&quot; is a small tree or large shrub, reaching 3–10 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 40 cm. The bark is thick, rough, and scaly. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in mixed pairs and threes (mostly pairs), slender, 3–5 cm long, and dull gray-green, with stomata on both inner and outer surfaces. The cones are squat globose, 3–5 cm long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18–20 months old, with only a small number of thin scales, with typically 5-12 fertile scales.

The cones open to 4–6 cm broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds measure 10–12 mm long, with a very thin shell, a white endosperm, and a vestigial 1–2 mm wing; they are dispersed by the Woodhouse&#x27;s scrub jay, which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and able to grow into new trees.

==Taxonomy==
Texas pinyon was previously included in Mexican pinyon, only being discovered as distinct in 1966 when US botanist Elbert L. Little noticed that the seed shells of some pinyons in Texas were very thin compared to many others. He treated it as a variety of Mexican pinyon, Pinus cembroides var. &quot;remota&quot;. Subsequent research found other differences, and it is now usually treated as a distinct species, probably more closely related to the Colorado pinyon &quot;P. edulis&quot;, which shares thin seed shells and needles mostly in pairs. Texas pinyon differs from both Mexican and Colorado pinyons in the very small, recessed umbo on the cone scales (larger and knob-like on other pinyons).

==Distribution and habitat==
The range is in western Texas, United States, on the south edge of the Edwards Plateau and the hills between Fort Stockton and Presidio, and in northeastern Mexico, mainly in Coahuila but also just into Chihuahua and Nuevo León. It occurs at low to moderate altitudes, from 450–700 m on the Edwards Plateau and from 1200–1800 m in the rest of its range. It is scarce, with small, scattered populations usually on dry, rocky sites and arroyos where bare rock lowers the likelihood of wildfire spreading easily.

== Uses ==
The edible seeds are occasionally collected like those of other pinyons, and sold as pine nuts. However, in its barren, dry habitat, infrequent and small crops are normal, reducing its economic value. It is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree, where its remarkable tolerance of drought and even semi-desert conditions makes it valuable in hot, dry areas.

==The papershell piñón and Cabeza de Vaca==
Pinus remota has importance in determining the route of Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca, the first European to explore Texas and the northern part of Mexico. Writing an account of his experiences, Cabeza de Vaca said that in 1535 the Indians of the region through which he was passing gave him and his companions pine nuts to eat which were &quot;better than those of Castile [Spain], because they have very thin shells.&quot;

In attempting to determine the route followed by Cabeza de Vaca from near the area of Galveston, Texas on the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean coast of Mexico, several scholars, notably Cleve Hallenbeck in 1940, believed that the statement by Cabeza de Vaca referred to the seeds of Pinus edulis, the Colorado piñón, which is found in the mountains of southern New Mexico and adjacent Texas—but not in northeastern Mexico. The Mexican piñón (Pinus cembroides) found in Mexico has thick shells, rather than the thin shells described by Cabeza de Vaca. Therefore, Hallenbeck concluded on the basis of the range of piñón species that Cabeza de Vaca had traversed Texas westward from near Galveston to southernmost New Mexico and crossed the Rio Grande river near El Paso, Texas.

To the contrary, Alex D. Krieger in a doctoral dissertation (1961) proposed instead that Cabeza De Vaca had traversed the coast of Texas, crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico and turned northwest, passing near present-day Monclova, Mexico and proceeding through Mexico to meet the Rio Grande again near present-day Presidio, Texas. Krieger&#x27;s trans-Mexican route for Cabeza de Vaca was dismissed by proponents of a trans-Texas route because no piñón with thin shelled seeds was known to be native to northern Mexico.

However, in 1966, botanist Elbert L. Little first described a subspecies of the Mexican piñón with &quot;thin shelled seeds&quot; and in 1979 the thin-shelled piñón was proposed to be considered as a separate species with the name &quot;Pinus remota&quot; or papershell piñón. In 1996, scholars traveled to the Monclova, Mexico area and collected specimens of the papershell piñón, thus proving that Cabeza de Vaca might have encountered thin-shelled piñón seeds in Mexico as well as in Texas. The trans-Mexico route of Cabeza de Vaca, proposed by Krieger, now has the support of many scholars.

<text>Sydney 2000 is the official video game of the Games of the XXVII Olympiad, hosted by Sydney, Australia in 2000.

==Gameplay==

Although the button mashing-laden gameplay has not changed from previous games, the main competition itself become more complex with the inclusion of the Virtual Gym and a complete Olympics qualifying tour, composed by four stages, and the player can only run for the medals of the events they qualified for. While some of the events are the women&#x27;s, each event is only set to one gender: it is not possible to run the women&#x27;s 100 m hurdles or the men&#x27;s high jump.

Individually, there is not much difference in gameplay from previous games: two action buttons control speed a third performs an extra action, such as jumping, passing a hurdle, setting the angle and releasing the hammer or javelin, or touching the wall. All events rely on this formula, except Skeet, K1 Slalom, and diving (which uses &quot;click-a-long&quot; rather than the freeform jumping of &quot;Olympic Gold&quot;). Chase Cycling also requires pacing by the player, or the final cyclist will run out of long pace before the final sprint.

The biggest difference from previous games in the series lies in the Olympic mode: instead of starting in the Olympics, the player must improve and qualify an athlete for the event. Each event has four stages (Open Trials, Invitation Event, The Championship, and Olympic Class), and for each stage the player must complete minigames in the Cyber Gym that range from running on a treadmill, climbing a pole, squats or reaction training, for a total of 20 minigames. Completing a Cyber Gym game improves the athlete in one of the three ratings temporarily, and to earn the new capacities definitively, the athlete must complete an event with a certain score. After the player is happy with the athlete&#x27;s development, they can try to qualify for the next stage by running against other athletes at the same level. Although it is possible to compete in the Olympics as soon as the athlete reaches the Olympic Class, to get a perfect athlete (with 100% on all ratings) one must complete all minigames, including those on Olympic Class. As the game relies mostly on athletes&#x27; ratings, even players with lower button presses per minute can make World Record times without serious effort as long as they passed all the mini games. Other modes include an arcade mode, training and head to head, where two players can compete with their Olympic mode trained athletes. There are four difficulty levels.

Although generally stable, the game lacks tweaking in some events: the High jump uses men&#x27;s results, and while some events such as the 100 m sprint and triple jump are quite easy, others such as the javelin and hammer throw require much training.

==Reception==
&quot;Sydney 2000&quot; received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the Dreamcast and PlayStation versions were ported for release and published by Capcom on 26 October 2000, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 27 out of 40 for the former, and 26 out of 40 for the latter. &quot;GameZone&quot; gave the PC version a score of nine out of ten and said, &quot;The graphical quality of this program makes it a sure-fire winner. What it lacks in some areas, it makes up for in others. If you are a fan of Olympic-style action, this is a must-have.&quot; However, &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; gave it one-and-a-half stars out of five and said that it was &quot;a prime example of a game that should have stayed where it belonged--on the consoles,&quot; and that the game &quot;simply isn&#x27;t much fun; most of the time, it isn&#x27;t any fun at all. It feels more like work than a good time and that&#x27;s never a good recipe for success.&quot;

&quot;Edge&quot; gave the Dreamcast and PC versions each a score of seven out of ten, saying that the game was &quot;as faithful an exponent of [the key-bashing dynamic] as any of &quot;Decathlon&quot;″s distant children.&quot; Colin Williamson of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; criticised the button mashing-gameplay and frustration game control of the latter version, and stated, &quot;All in all, &quot;Sydney&quot;″s quality is disturbingly inconsistent, and there are, sadly, more bad games than good in this particular collection. If you want to recreate the Olympic experience, break into the local high school track and run a few laps, or hop into the La-Z-Boy with a big tub of popcorn and leave it to the professionals.&quot; Kevin Rice of &quot;NextGen&quot; called the former version &quot;A weekend rental at best. It&#x27;s somewhat amusing to relive childhood memories of the local arcade, but the game&#x27;s lack of depth and repetitive game mechanics grow old quickly.&quot;

Cheat Monkey of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of the PlayStation version, &quot;If you&#x27;re hankering for some Olympic competition and want to go beyond the standard track and field events, &quot;Sydney 2000&quot; is a decent pick. It&#x27;s not a gold medal winner, but it finishes the PlayStation invitational with a bronze.&quot; He then said of the Dreamcast version, &quot;Overall, &quot;Sydney 2000&quot; for the Dreamcast is a better game than the PlayStation version in more ways than one, but it&#x27;s still held to a bronze medal finish in the sports games category. If you&#x27;ve got Olympic fever, &quot;Sydney 2000&quot; will carry the torch for you, but only so far.&quot; Brian Wright, however, said of the PC version, &quot;It seems that as long as computers continue to exist, companies will continue to release decathlon-style games. The button-mashing game mechanics may appeal to novice gamers or those on a nostalgia kick, but the familiar and repetitive gameplay means that &quot;Sydney 2000&quot; doesn&#x27;t get the gold.&quot;

<text>&quot;Rappaccini&#x27;s Daughter&quot; is a Gothic short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne first published in the December 1844 issue of &quot;The United States Magazine and Democratic Review&quot; in New York, and later in various collections. It is about Giacomo Rappaccini, a medical researcher in Padua who grows a garden of poisonous plants. He brings up his daughter to tend the plants, and she becomes resistant to the poisons, but in the process she herself becomes poisonous to others. The traditional story of a poisonous maiden has been traced back to India, and Hawthorne&#x27;s version has been adopted in contemporary works.

==Plot summary==
The story is set in Padua, Italy, in a distant and unspecified past, possibly in the sixteenth century, after the Paduan Botanical Garden had been founded.

Giovanni Guasconti, a young student recently arrived from Naples, Southern Italy, to study at the University of Padua, is renting a room in an ancient building that still exhibits the Coat of Arms of the once-great, long since extinct Scrovegni family. Giovanni has studied Dante Alighieri&#x27;s Divine Comedy and remembers that an ancestor of the Scrovegni, Reginaldo degli Scrovegni, appears in Dante&#x27;s Hell, as a usurer and a sinner against Nature and Art ().

From his quarters, Giovanni looks at Beatrice, the beautiful daughter of Dr. Giacomo Rappaccini, a botanist who works in isolation. Beatrice is confined to the lush and locked gardens, which are filled with exotic poisonous plants grown by her father.

Having fallen in love, Giovanni enters the garden and secretly meets with Beatrice a number of times, while ignoring his mentor, Professor Pietro Baglioni. Professor Baglioni is a rival of Dr. Rappaccini and he warns Giovanni that Rappaccini is devious and that he and his work should be avoided.

Giovanni notices Beatrice&#x27;s strangely intimate relationship with the plants as well as the withering of fresh regular flowers and the death of an insect when exposed to her skin or breath. On one occasion, Beatrice embraces a plant in a way that she seems part of the plant itself; then she talks to the plant, &quot;Give me thy breath, my sister, for I am faint with common air.&quot;

Giovanni eventually realizes that Beatrice, having been raised in the presence of poison, has developed an immunity and has become poisonous herself. A gentle touch of her hand leaves a purple print on his wrist. Beatrice urges Giovanni to look past her poisonous exterior and see her pure and innocent essence, creating great feelings of doubt and confusion in Giovanni.

In the end, Giovanni becomes poisonous himself: insects die when they come into contact with his breath. Giovanni is troubled by this, which he sees as a curse, and he blames Beatrice.

Professor Baglioni gives him an antidote to cure Beatrice and free her from her father&#x27;s cruel experiment. However, when Beatrice drinks the antidote, she becomes sick and dies.

Before realizing that Beatrice is dying, Dr. Rappaccini excitedly welcomes the love between his two creatures, his daughter and her suitor, Giovanni, who has been transformed so that he can now be a true and worthy companion to Beatrice.

While Beatrice is dying, Professor Baglioni looks down from a window into the garden and triumphantly shouts &quot;Rappaccini! Rappaccini! and is THIS the upshot of your experiment!&quot;

==Interpretations==

The story has parallels with that of Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis, possibly with Dr. Rappaccini representing God (or a man playing God), Beatrice and Giovanni respectively representing Adam and Eve (with reversed gender roles) and Professor Baglioni representing Satan (or, alternatively, God). It is relevant to note that Giovanni/Eve offers Beatrice/Adam the antidote, suggesting that both should drink of it, but only Beatrice/Adam does so. The story would then represent the fall from grace, the expulsion from the Garden of Eden, and the introduction of the original sin.

According to one possible interpretation, the moral of the story is that mortals should not attempt to play God: Beatrice dies for the sins of her father, Dr. Rappaccini, whose experiments aimed at interfering with the laws of Nature. According to an opposite interpretation, Giovanni is not able to accept the gift that Beatrice brings, and her uniqueness: in the attempt to make her normal, he loses her and her love.

==Genre==

&quot;Rappaccini&#x27;s Daughter&quot; is a Gothic story.

Beatrice is socially and physically isolated from the rest of the world. Due to supernatural causes or due to Dr Rappaccini&#x27;s mysterious scientific experiments, she seems to belong to the garden only, a flower among flowers: she lives a happy life until she meets Giovanni, with whom she falls in love. How Beatrice becomes poisonous remains without logical explanation. Although she is innocent and pure, Giovanni is convinced that she is corrupted or cursed by her poisonousness, and that she needs to be saved. Although in distress, Beatrice accepts to drink the antidote for the sake of Giovanni and dies like the heroine of a tragic romance.

Dr. Rappaccini remains a mysterious character, described only by his rival/enemy Professor Baglioni. Dr. Rappaccini is represented as a Faustian/diabolical figure, unnaturally ambitious and with cruel hidden motivations. Only at the end his intentions are revealed: he created the garden for his daughter and her future suitor, hoping to place them above all other creatures, just like God had created the Garden of Eden for Adam and Eve.

The end of the story leaves the reader shocked and filled with horror as well as confused about the ambiguity in meaning and moral of the story.

Further Gothic elements are the theme of morality, the great deal of symbolism, the description of strong emotions (love, jealousy, ambition), the setting in a distant past, in a place with a possibly dark history.

==Sources==

The name of Rappaccini&#x27;s daughter is a reference to Dante&#x27;s Beatrice, allegory of Divine Wisdom and Divine Grace: the name means &quot;&quot;she who brings bliss&quot;, &quot;she who makes blessed&quot;&quot;. Dante meets her in the Garden of Eden, while a hundred angels scatter flowers above and around her ().

According to Octavio Paz, the sources of Hawthorne&#x27;s story lie in Ancient India. In the play &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot;, one of two political rivals employs the gift of a visha kanya, a beautiful girl who is fed on poison. This theme of a woman transformed into a phial of venom is popular in Indian literature and appears in the Puranas. From India, the story passed to the West and contributed to the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot;, among other texts. In the 17th century, Robert Burton picked up the tale in &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot; and gave it a historical character: the Indian king Porus sends Alexander the Great a girl brimming with poison.

In Hawthorne&#x27;s story, the character Pietro Baglioni draws a parallel between Beatrice&#x27;s fate and an old story of a poisonous Indian girl presented to Alexander, a tale that appears to be based on the Burton/Browne story. Also, the University of Padua is famed for its vast botanical garden, which was founded in 1545. But whether the garden actually influenced Hawthorne in writing &quot;Rappaccini&#x27;s Daughter&quot; is not known.

It is also possible that Hawthorne was inspired by the character Elizabeth&#x27;s grotesque revenge in the 1833 novel &quot;The Down-Easters&quot; by fellow New Englander John Neal. The two authors first connected when Neal&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Yankee&quot; published the first substantial praise of Hawthorne&#x27;s work in 1828.

==Style==
Hawthorne begins the story with reference to the writings of the fictional writer &#x27;Monsieur Aubépine&#x27;, named after the French name of the hawthorn plant. He both praises and criticizes the author&#x27;s style and intent. This introduction aims to establish a tone of uncertainty and confusion, throwing off expectations and establishing the theme of the interrelationship of perception, reality and fantasy. He lists texts by M. de l&#x27;Aubépine, some of which translate into Hawthorne&#x27;s own works as follows:
* &quot;Contes deux fois racontés&quot; is &quot;Twice-Told Tales&quot;.
* &quot;Le Voyage céleste à chemin de fer&quot; is &quot;The Celestial Railroad&quot;.
* &quot;Le Nouveau Père Adam et la Nouvelle Mère Eve&quot; is &quot;The New Adam and Eve&quot;.
* &quot;Rodéric ou le Serpent à l&#x27;estomac&quot; is &quot;Egotism; or, The Bosom-Serpent&quot;.
* &quot;Le Culte de feu&quot; is &quot;Fire Worship&quot;.
* &quot;L&#x27;Artiste du beau&quot; is &quot;The Artist of the Beautiful or the Mechanical Butterfly.&quot;

The narrator says the text was translated from &quot;Beatrice ou la Belle Empoisonneuse&quot; which translates to &quot;Beatrice or the Beautiful Poisoner&quot; and was published in &quot;La Revue Anti-Aristocratique&quot; (&quot;The Anti-Aristocratic Review&quot;).

<doc id="1246762" wikidata="Q1750071" url="?curid=1246762" title="Rywin affair">
<text>The Rywin affair () was a corruption scandal in Poland, which began in late 2002 while the post-communist government of the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) was in power. It is named after Polish film producer Lew Rywin, who was a key figure.

== Chain of events ==
On 22 July 2002, Lew Rywin called at the office of Adam Michnik, editor of Poland&#x27;s largest daily newspaper, &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;. Rywin sought a bribe of 17.5 million USD to arrange a change to a draft law aimed at limiting the print media&#x27;s influence on radio and television, which would have been in Michnik&#x27;s favour; the original draft would have prevented the paper&#x27;s publishing house, Agora S.A. from taking over the private TV station Polsat or the second channel of Poland&#x27;s public TV broadcaster Telewizja Polska. Rywin said he was acting on behalf of what he called a &quot;group in power&quot; which wanted to remain anonymous but possibly included then prime minister Leszek Miller of the post-communist Alliance of the Democratic Left.

Michnik secretly recorded the conversation and started investigations to establish the identity of the &quot;group in power&quot;. He also arranged a meeting between Miller, Rywin, and himself in Miller&#x27;s office. When Miller denied any involvement in the deal Rywin had put forward, according to the others present, Rywin lost his composure and even spoke of committing suicide. Rywin himself later claimed to have been under the influence of alcohol.

Only after &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;″s investigations had remained inconclusive, on 27 December 2002 – six months after the incident, which cast some doubts on the real role of the newspaper in the affair – the paper printed the partial record of Michnik&#x27;s conversation with Rywin, igniting the scandal. However, other papers had reported parts of the story earlier (e.g. weekly magazine &quot;Wprost&quot;)

In January 2003, the Polish parliament (Sejm) created a special committee to conduct an investigation into the circumstances of the affair. A separate penal prosecution resulted in Rywin being sentenced to two years in prison and a 100,000 złoty fine on 26 April 2004 for fraud, as the court concluded that the &quot;group in power&quot; did not exist and Rywin had been acting on his own initiative. On 10 December 2004, the Warsaw court of appeals repealed this sentence, sentencing Rywin to a reduced term of two years for &quot;paid protection&quot; on behalf of a still anonymous group.

==Contradictory conclusions==
In the meantime, the protracted hearings of the Sejm&#x27;s special committee continued. On April 5, 2004 the committee officially finished proceedings. With a majority vote supported by the SLD and Samoobrona deputies to the committee, it came to the same conclusion as the penal court, according to which Rywin had been acting completely on his own.

However, the dissenting minority, including committee chairman Tomasz Nałęcz, refused to back the report and began to compile minority reports. The Sejm then had to decide whether to accept the committee&#x27;s official final report or one of the various minority reports as the outcome of the investigation. On September 24, 2004, the Sejm unexpectedly voted to accept the minority report that most radically departed from the majority report, and named the following people as the masterminds behind Rywin&#x27;s mission:
*prime minister Leszek Miller (stepped down in May 2004)
*, deputy minister of culture in Miller&#x27;s government, who was also in charge of the amendment of the law that could have benefited Agora S.A.
*Włodzimierz Czarzasty, another high-ranking SLD media policy-maker 
*, head of the Polish national public TV broadcaster Telewizja Polska, the second channel of which was proposed to be privatized and a possible target for an Agora S.A. takeover
*, Miller&#x27;s Chief of Cabinet, later in charge of the Polish EU membership referendum as minister without portfolio.

==Long-term impact on political culture==
Former dissident Adam Michnik&#x27;s reputation was damaged, as he was suspected to be more deeply entangled in the scandal, although in what way remains unclear. His friendly relations with members of the former communist political establishment were exposed. This increased the numbers of Poles who are convinced that politicians and opinion-leaders are involved with the large-scale shadow economy.

The right-wing party Law and Justice, whose defining themes are the fight against crime and corruption, benefited from the affair, which raised its public profile. The party&#x27;s deputy Zbigniew Ziobro authored the radical minority report which the Sejm passed.

The scandal was a major factor in the SLD&#x27;s severe defeat at the 2005 elections. It declined to the point that it was swept out of the Sejm altogether in 2015. The party returned to the legislature four years later, and has since renamed itself New Left. The party would not return to government until 2023, when it became a junior partner in a broad pro-European coalition headed by Donald Tusk.

<doc id="1246766" wikidata="Q177411" url="?curid=1246766" title="Jean Giono">
<text>Jean Giono (30 March 1895 – 8 October 1970) was a French writer who wrote works of fiction mostly set in the Provence region of France.

==First period==
Jean Giono was born to a family of modest means, his father a cobbler of Piedmontese descent and his mother a laundry woman. He spent the majority of his life in Manosque, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. Forced by family needs to leave school at the age of sixteen and get a job in a bank, he nevertheless continued to read voraciously, in particular the great classic works of literature including the Bible, Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, the works of Virgil, and the &quot;Tragiques&quot; of Agrippa d&#x27;Aubigné. He continued to work at the bank until he was called up for military service at the outbreak of World War I. He took part in the Battle of Verdun. The horrors he experienced on the front lines turned him into an ardent and lifelong pacifist. In 1919, he returned to the bank, and a year later, married a childhood friend with whom he had two children. Following the success of his first published novel, &quot;Colline&quot; (1929) (which won him the Prix Brentano earned $1,000, and drew an English translation of the book), he left the bank in 1930 to devote himself to writing on a full-time basis.

&quot;Colline&quot; was followed by two more novels heavily influenced by Virgil and Homer, &quot;Un de Baumugnes&quot; (1929) and &quot;Regain&quot; (1930), the three together comprising the famous “Pan trilogy”, so-called because in it Giono depicts the natural world as being imbued with the power of the Greek god Pan. The other novels Giono published during the nineteen-thirties on the whole continued in the same vein—set in Provence, with peasants as protagonists, and displaying a pantheistic view of nature. Marcel Pagnol based three of his films on Giono&#x27;s work of this period: &quot;Regain&quot;, starring Fernandel and with music by Honegger; &quot;Angèle&quot;, and &quot;La Femme du boulanger&quot;, with the actor Raimu.

Throughout the nineteen-thirties, Giono expressed the pacifism he had adopted as a result of his experiences during World War I in novels such as &quot;Le grand troupeau&quot; (1931), and pamphlets such as &quot;Refus d’obéissance&quot; (1937), and the &quot;Lettre aux paysans sur la pauvreté et la paix&quot; (1938). This in turn resulted in his forming a relationship with a group of like-minded people including Lucien Jacques and Henri Fluchère among others, who gathered each year in the hamlet of Contadour, and whose pacifist writings were published as the &quot;Cahiers du Contadour&quot;.

In 1937, he famously asked, &quot;What is the worst that can happen if Germany invades France?&quot;

==Transition==

The end of the nineteen-thirties brought a crisis in Giono&#x27;s life. As far as his writing was concerned, he had come to feel that it was time to stop “doing Giono” (&quot;faire du Giono&quot;), and to take his work in a new direction. At the same time it was becoming apparent that his work for pacifism was a failure, and that another war was inevitable and fast approaching. The declaration of war on 1 September 1939 came while the Contadoureans were assembled for their annual reunion. The result of Giono&#x27;s former peace-making efforts was that he was briefly imprisoned as a Nazi sympathiser before the proceedings were dropped without any charges being laid.

The subsequent period of renewal saw the self-educated Giono now turn to Stendhal as a literary model in the same way as previously he had been influenced by the Classics. His novels thus began to be set in a specific time and place, confronting the protagonists with specific politics, issues, causes and events, in contrast with the timelessness of his earlier work. He also adopted the Stendhalian narrative technique of letting the reader into the experience of the protagonist by means of the interior monologue, whereas the dominant technique of his earlier novels had been that of the omniscient narrator.

He similarly formed the ambition of writing a sequence of ten novels inspired by Balzac’s &quot;Comédie humaine&quot;, in which he would depict characters from all strata of society rather than peasants, and compare and contrast different moments in history by depicting the experiences of members of the same family in times a hundred years apart. This project was never realised, with only the four &quot;Hussard&quot; novels, (&quot;Angelo&quot; (1958), &quot;Le Hussard sur le Toit&quot; (1951), &quot;Le Bonheur fou&quot; (1957), &quot;Mort d’un personnage&quot; (1948)) actually completed according to plan, but it is echoed in Giono&#x27;s postwar work in the dichotomy between historical novels set in the mid-nineteenth century, and contemporary novels set in the mid-twentieth. His newfound interest in history even led to his writing an actual history book, &quot;Le Désastre de Pavie&quot; (1963).

As he began to focus on the human being rather than the natural world, his understanding of psychology and motivation was also influenced by the writings of Niccolò Machiavelli, whose analysis helped him to articulate a much darker view of human nature in his later years, and about whom he wrote the article &quot;Monsieur Machiavel, ou le coeur humain dévoilé&quot; (1951).

In 1944, when France was liberated, Giono was again accused of collaboration with the Nazis, and was again imprisoned for five months before he was freed without charges ever being made. This led to his being blacklisted, so that for three years he was barred from publication. It was during this period of ostracism that he began in 1945 to write &quot;Angelo&quot;, metaphorically the laboratory in which he experimented, tested and attempted to integrate his new approach to his work. It contains not only a first version of the story of Angélo Pardi that took its final form in &quot;Le Hussard sur le toit&quot; and &quot;Le Bonheur fou&quot;, but also the nucleus of many other works of his second period, and makes use of new narrative techniques he developed further in other novels. He ultimately set it aside, no doubt considering it too derivative, and moved on to the other projects it gave rise to.

==Second period==

The first major novel of his second period to be published was &quot;Un roi sans divertissement&quot; (published in 1947, and made into a successful film for which Giono himself wrote the screenplay, in 1963). It takes the form of a detective story set in Haute Provence in the early nineteenth century, and reveals Giono&#x27;s new pessimism about human nature in that the policeman is forced to the realisation that he himself is capable of being as evil as the murderer he is tracking. Stylistically brilliant, it consists of the juxtaposed accounts of events as told by the different people affected, devoid of explanation, from which the reader must piece together the meaning.

The most famous novel of his second period is &quot;Le Hussard sur le toit&quot;, the first part of the definitive version of the story of Angélo Pardi he had sketched in &quot;Angelo&quot;. It was published in 1951, and made into a film by Jean-Paul Rappeneau starring Juliette Binoche in 1995. Angélo, like Stendhal&#x27;s Fabrice del Dongo&quot; (La Chartreuse de Parme)&quot; on whom he is modeled, is a chivalrous romantic whose quest constitutes an inquiry into the nature of happiness, while the cholera epidemic he finds himself confronted with in Provence in 1832 is an allegory for the wars that had so deeply affected Giono. In structure it is a picaresque series of episodes, full of evocative descriptions of the country. Its sequel, &quot;Le Bonheur fou&quot; (The Straw Man) (1957) follows Angélo in the Italy of the 1848 revolution.

&quot;Les Ames fortes&quot; (1950), filmed by Raoul Ruiz in 2001, is another of the masterpieces of this period. As dark as &quot;Un Roi sans divertissement&quot;, it examines the depths a person can sink to in greed, grasping self-interest and the exploitation of others. Also as in &quot;Un Roi sans divertissement&quot;, the story is again told purely in the words of the protagonists, without the intervention of a narrator or comment from the author, thus forcing readers to reach their own conclusions. &quot;Les Grands chemins&quot; (1951), considerably less dark, deals with the nature of the road, gambling, the lie, and friendship, again in a first-person narration entirely in the voice of the protagonist and devoid of explanation or elucidation from the author.

Also worthy of mention is his &quot;Voyage en Italie&quot; (1953). Neither a travel guide nor a straightforward account of a trip as the name suggests, this is a highly personal account of Giono&#x27;s experiences and of the people he meets and sees that tells the reader more about Giono than about Italy.

Outside France, Giono&#x27;s best-known work is probably the short story &quot;The Man who Planted Trees&quot; (and 1987 film version). This optimistic tale of a man who brings a deserted valley back to life by planting trees reflects Giono&#x27;s long-standing love of the natural world, an attitude that made him a precursor to the modern ecological movement. He thus declined to receive any royalties from this text, and granted free use to anyone who wanted to distribute or translate it. The French forestry authority (ONF) initiated a project named &quot;Giono&quot; in 2013. A small plot of beech trees of more southerly genetics was planted as an assisted migration experiment for climate change adaptation on the former World War I battlefield in Verdun. As of 2024, the beech saplings are growing well. 

In his later years, Giono was honoured with the Prince Rainier of Monaco literary prize in 1953, awarded for his lifetime achievements, was elected to the Académie Goncourt in 1954, and became a member of the &quot;Conseil Littéraire&quot; of Monaco in 1963.

Giono died of a heart attack in 1970.

The Collège Jean Giono in Nice is named after him, as are streets in Cannes and Fréjus.

<doc id="1246776" wikidata="Q1534925" url="?curid=1246776" title="The Matches">
<text>The Matches are an American rock band from Oakland, California, active from 1997 to 2009. Formed as the Locals, the group changed their name after five years to avoid conflict with a Chicago band of the same name. As the Matches, they self-released their debut album &quot;E. Von Dahl Killed the Locals&quot; in 2003, then signed to Epitaph Records who re-released it the following year. &quot;Decomposer&quot; followed in 2006, seeing the band move from their pop punk roots in a more idiosyncratic direction with contributions from nine different record producers; it reached no. 18 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Independent Albums chart. With their third album, &quot;A Band in Hope&quot; (2008), their sound became even more heavily layered and experimental; it was their only release to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching no. 179.

The band went on hiatus in 2009, releasing a digital album of previously unreleased songs, previously released B-sides and bonus tracks, and demos. Between 2014 and 2018 they reunited several times for shows and tours celebrating the ten year anniversaries of each of their studio albums, resulting in three live albums and a new single. A documentary film about the band, titled &quot;Bleeding Audio&quot;, premiered at film festivals in 2020.

==History==
===The Locals (1997–2002)===
Bishop O&#x27;Dowd High School sophomores Matt Esposito (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Justin San Souci (bass guitar, backing vocals) and freshman Matt Whalen (drums, percussion) started the band in 1997. Sophomore Shawn Harris (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) saw them play at the school talent show and soon joined them: &quot;I offered to play second guitar and add some original songs to the mix, and we spent the next four years getting noise complaints from neighbors.&quot; The four named their band the Locals. In 2000 they came to the attention of Miles Hurwitz, former assistant publisher of &quot;BAM&quot;, through his eighth-grade son. He attended one of their practices, later saying that &quot;I saw a spark — talent, vocal charm, hook-tinged material, musical accomplishment and much potential. And much to be improved.&quot; Hurwitz, 28 years the bands members&#x27; senior, became their manager. He would play a critical role in their career, co-writing their songs with Harris and other band members, producing some of their tracks, directing some of their music videos, and participating in creative decisions including planning the group&#x27;s image, wardrobe, and photographs. In their later album credits, the band nicknamed him &quot;The Wizard&quot;. &quot;Miles kept us together,&quot; said Harris in 2008; &quot;We didn&#x27;t know we could be in a band. We didn&#x27;t know how to make that jump [...] We&#x27;ll work with him forever. He&#x27;s an integral part of our equation.&quot;

After graduating, Esposito left the band to attend the United States Naval Academy, and was replaced by Jon Devoto. The Locals self-released a six-song demo and a three-song EP. The band members took jobs as kitchen hands at historic San Francisco music venue the Fillmore, where they would watch bands perform weekly; Harris worked as a cook while Whalen and San Souci were servers, hoping that this would get their band an opportunity to perform there. They took vocal lessons, and Hurwitz expanded their musical palette by having them listen to albums by Elvis Costello, Joe Jackson, and Bob Dylan. &quot;He was a history teacher for a while,&quot; said Harris; &quot;He made what we were doing seem more important and relevant. Subtly at first and then more and more, that set us apart from the other bands in the genre we play in.&quot;

The Locals built up a following in the East Bay. Not readily accepted by the entrenched punk rock scene based around the 924 Gilman Street venue in Berkeley, they instead become popular at Oakland all ages venue iMusicast, where they launched a series of shows called &quot;L3: Live, Loud, and Local&quot;. &quot;We could barely play,&quot; said Harris in 2016; &quot;like we broke all of our amps at every show, I spent more time crowd surfing than playing my guitar. I couldn&#x27;t really tell you how to play a power chord at the time; we barely could play. But we put on this show that people came to and they freaked out, so I started focusing on lyrics and making songs have more substantial content.&quot; They engaged in what they called &quot;commo promo&quot; tactics (short for &quot;commotion promotion&quot;), playing brief, unannounced acoustic sets outside schools, dormitories, shopping malls, restaurants, and music venues such as Slim&#x27;s. They would go to local high schools, enter classes that were in session, toss stacks of flyers in the air, and run through the halls strumming their guitars and singing their songs until they were chased off campus. These tactics were successful in drawing hundreds of young fans to their shows. &quot;We didn&#x27;t mean to start a completely different scene,&quot; recalled Harris a few years later, &quot;but we ended up doing so. While I love punk rock, I also don&#x27;t love punk rock. I think it&#x27;s just as much of a dick as it is a savior. I love Bad Religion and Rancid and Green Day, but I&#x27;m not gonna throw my fist up in the air for the institution of punk rock.&quot;

In late 2002 the group was contacted by a Chicago band also called the Locals, led by frontwoman Yvonne Doll, threatening a lawsuit if they did not change their name. They complied, renaming themselves the Matches.

===&quot;E. Von Dahl Killed the Locals&quot; (2003–2005)===
The Matches recorded their debut album, &quot;E. Von Dahl Killed the Locals&quot;, in a series of basements and living rooms and self-released it in February 2003. The title was a tongue-in-cheek reference to Yvonne Doll and the band&#x27;s forced name change. Harris and San Souci created the album&#x27;s artwork (Harris also co-designed the artwork for Earlimart&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Treble &amp; Tremble&quot;). Through self-promotion and performances with bands including Reel Big Fish, Lit, and Zebrahead, the Matches gained attention for their energetic live shows and sold over 4,000 copies of the album without the support of a record label. A show at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California on October 21, 2003 was filmed, and released the following July as part of Kung Fu Records&#x27; live concert DVD series &quot;The Show Must Go Off!&quot; The band contributed the song &quot;December Is for Cynics&quot; to the compilation &quot;A Santa Cause: It&#x27;s a Punk Rock Christmas&quot;, released in November 2003.

By year&#x27;s end, the Matches had signed to Epitaph Records. The label had &quot;E. Von Dahl Killed the Locals&quot; re-mixed by Joe Barresi and re-released it in May 2004 with a slightly altered track list. The Matches performed on that summer&#x27;s Warped Tour, which they would repeat in the three subsequent years. They appeared, along with the A.K.A.s, as guests on the Dwarves track &quot;Kids Today&quot; on the compilation &quot;Rock Against Bush, Vol. 2&quot;, released in August 2004. That November, a music video was released for the song &quot;Chain Me Free&quot;, and the band went on tour opening for Yellowcard.

At this time, the Matches&#x27; music was rooted in pop punk. Reviewing the re-release of &quot;E. Von Dahl Killed the Locals&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that the band &quot;join the long list of punk-pop bands that have made their clichéd mark on today&#x27;s music scene&quot; and &quot;wear the influences of Green Day and Rancid proudly.&quot; The &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; called it &quot;an energetic romp through the same ideas lots of pop-punk bands romp through: broken relationships, boredom, depression, the lure of the road&quot;, while AllMusic remarked that the band was &quot;young enough not to raise eyebrows at the punk-pop kiddie park. But they have a better grasp of dynamics than much of their peer group&quot;.

The Matches teamed up with Zebrahead for a cover version of Oingo Boingo&#x27;s rendition of the Willie Dixon song &quot;Violent Love&quot;, released in May 2005 on &quot;Dead Bands Party: A Tribute to Oingo Boingo&quot;. That July saw the release of &quot;Takeover Records 3-Way Issue No. 2&quot;, a split album which they shared with Near Miss and Reeve Oliver, with each band contributing three tracks. Harris and San Souci created the artwork for the album (they would later co-create the artwork for Newbury Park group Stole Your Woman&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;The Scene&quot;). The Matches played the Warped Tour again that summer. Harris began illustrating with Melbourne-based artist Emilee Seymour; together they formed the design firm Oxen, creating the artwork for the next two Matches albums as well as for Epitaph labelmates Matchbook Romance&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Voices&quot;.

===&quot;Decomposer&quot; and &quot;A Band in Hope&quot; (2006–2008)===
The Matches made a guest appearance on MC Lars&#x27;s album &quot;The Graduate&quot;, released in March 2006, performing on the track &quot;Hot Topic Is Not Punk Rock&quot;. After a stint on that year&#x27;s Warped Tour, their second album, &quot;Decomposer&quot;, was released on Epitaph that September. The album was recorded at various studios with nine different producers, including Hurwitz, Matt Rad, Mark Hoppus of Blink-182, Tim Armstrong of Rancid, Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, Nick Hexum of 311, and John Feldmann of Goldfinger. It built on their prior pop punk sound, adding idiosyncratic elements of pop, rock, punk, and electronics. Singles were released for the songs &quot;You (Don&#x27;t) Know Me&quot; and &quot;Salty Eyes&quot;, and music videos for &quot;Papercut Skin&quot; and &quot;Salty Eyes&quot;. Hurwitz directed and came up with the concept for the &quot;Salty Eyes&quot; video, an homage to the D. A. Pennebaker film &quot;Dont Look Back&quot; (1967), in which Bob Dylan&#x27;s song &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; plays while Dylan holds up and discards cue cards with selected words and phrases from the lyrics; in their video, the Matches replaced the cue cards with old television sets, creating a chaotic scene. A few weeks after its release, &quot;Decomposer&quot; peaked at number 18 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Independent Albums chart. Extensive touring followed: By March 2008, the Matches had done four tours of Australia (including that year&#x27;s Soundwave festival), seven of Europe (including their first headlining club tour of the United Kingdom), and three Warped Tours.

Their third album, &quot;A Band in Hope&quot;, was released in March 2008. Like the previous album, &quot;A Band In Hope&quot; was the result of the band&#x27;s collaboration with several different producers: Tim Armstrong, Mike Green, John Feldmann, Nick Hexum, Miles Hurwitz, John Paulsen and Paul Ruxton. The band embarked on that spring&#x27;s Alternative Press Tour with All Time Low, The Rocket Summer, and Forever the Sickest Kids to support it. The album found the band moving further away from pop punk, incorporating elements of album-oriented rock, mainstream Top 40 paradigms, and alternative rock. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;a tidy mass of musical ideas — metal, glam and punk all mingle, lots of vocals, textured, carefully layered sound, sometimes like a pocket-size Queen.&quot; Meanwhile &quot;PunkNews&quot; stated plainly, &quot;This album is epic. There is so much growth in both their musicianship and lyrics that it&#x27;s hard to believe that this is the same band that released their last two albums.&quot; An AllMusic review also drew a comparison to Queen, as well as to Andrew Lloyd Webber, saying &quot;the Matches don&#x27;t seem to know exactly what they&#x27;re doing [...] big chunks of &quot;A Band in Hope&quot; are almost shockingly unexpected, verging at times on just plain weird.&quot; On that note, &quot;The Flat Hat&quot; noted: &quot;what seems like the emergence of a different band on each track ... might sound like a recipe for disaster. It isn’t. The album’s thumping drums, clean guitars and soaring vocals will stop you in your tracks.&quot; This writer also asked whether &quot;operatic falsettos, erupting in a fury of crashing thunder and straight up Les Mis-style gang vocals [might be] Cheesy?&quot; and concluded &quot;Sure, but tell that to your fist, because it’ll still be raised high.&quot; Reflecting on the album a year and half later, Harris remarked that &quot;on &quot;Decomposer&quot; and &quot;A Band in Hope&quot;, we played around with a lot of studio tricks—especially &quot;Decomposer&quot;, which was us learning about a bunch of studio tricks. And then on &quot;A Band in Hope&quot;, we got carried away a number of times.&quot; &quot;Wake the Sun&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s single, and music videos were released for it and &quot;Yankee in a Chip Shop&quot;. According to Harris, Epitaph did not expect the album to perform well commercially, but opted to release it anyway. It ultimately reached number 24 on the Independent Albums chart, number 179 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and number 99 on Australia&#x27;s ARIA Charts.

===Hiatus and &quot;Album 4&quot; (2009–2013)===

Founding bassist Justin San Souci left the Matches in July 2008; he went on to become a concept artist for a video game company. He was replaced by Dylan Rowe, who toured with the band that fall. Creative differences were forming between the band members: A year later, lead guitarist Jon Devoto stated that he had wanted the band&#x27;s new music to be &quot;a little more straightforward. A little bit less quirky, indefinable. I want to keep the element of cleverness to a certain point, because that was one of the best points about us, our cleverness and all that. But there was also a point where every song was completely different and I think we lost a lot of opportunities with that.&quot; Harris stated that &quot;There were really conflicting views within the band as to what the direction should be. For me, the direction has always been, &#x27;Well, I wanna do what is fun when it comes to music and hopefully other people find what I find fun and enjoyable also fun and enjoyable.&#x27; There were definitely heated debates over, first off, how commercial a song should be, and second off, over what makes a song commercial in the first place.&quot; Their recording contract with Epitaph fulfilled, the band began writing and recording demos for a potential fourth album, but found these differences difficult to overcome. Harris later reflected:

We got really ambitious, and part of that paid off in a great way, because we were really creative, and we experimented with all types of music and different producers and became this weird, arty pop-punk band. But at the same time, we got wrapped up in [the industry]: &quot;You need to play for more people, you need to play for more people, you need to play for more people. You need to impress promoters.&quot; We tried to be bigger than we should&#x27;ve been. When I look at the appeal of the band originally—being this sort of homespun, DIY pop-punk band who put on their own shows and make their own clothes—we were like your friend&#x27;s band, but your friend&#x27;s &quot;good&quot; band. Our fans liked being around us. As things progressed, there was more of a separation between us as performers and our fans. Even the sound of the music became less like you&#x27;re talking to your friends and more sort of ambitiously epic, maybe. I think we always retained that conversational style, but it was really all we were at the beginning. I&#x27;m not saying we lost that completely, but it got swept up in us trying to be a bigger band. I think the appeal for our band might&#x27;ve been that we were your friend&#x27;s band.

Hurwitz sent the band&#x27;s new demos out to major record labels, attempting to get them a new recording contract, but the labels wanted them to alter the songs to make them more marketable. &quot;There seemed to be some kind of core ideology that was sort of at risk of being compromised from within and without&quot;, said Harris, who at the same time had begun working on a new musical project with Jake Grigg of Australian band Something with Numbers. Devoto, meanwhile, had been working on his own material which Hurwitz helped him develop into an acoustic project. Additionally, the impact of the Great Recession affected the band&#x27;s ability to tour: with their extensive touring schedules, they would stay with friends or with their parents when home, but as fuel prices and other costs increased, they could no longer break even on tours and were starting to accrue debt. They decided to stay home and record, and only tour when it would be lucrative, but such opportunities became fewer and further between. &quot;So we were home longer and longer,&quot; said Harris, &quot;which meant we were homeless longer and longer or crashing at our parents&#x27; longer and longer.&quot;

The Matches announced a hiatus on July 9, 2009. On August 12, they released their fourth album, &quot;The Matches Album 4, Unreleased; Graphics? Title? Or Not Needed?,&quot; recorded at Talking House Productions studios and produced by John Paulsen, with two tracks produced by Miles Hurwitz. The album comprised previously unreleased songs, previously released B-sides and bonus tracks, and the band&#x27;s most recent demos, and was described in the release notes as &quot;the final original recordings from the Matches prior to their hiatus.&quot; The title was the subject line of an email from Hurwitz asking about the proposed album. &quot;The album name is basically making fun of our manager&#x27;s verbose e-mails&quot;, said Harris; &quot;[The title] was just the subject header [of his e-mail], and it had all these semicolons and like a four-way conjunction, so we just sent back the shortest e-mail saying, &#x27;That&#x27;s the title.&#x27; He tried to get us to change it a number of times, but we were like, &#x27;Nope. That&#x27;s it. The band played a pair of sold out farewell shows on August 22 at the Troubadour in West Hollywood and August 23 at the Fillmore in San Francisco. Harris said of the latter that &quot;the final show was I think the Matches&#x27; best show. We sold out the Fillmore which is where I used to make nachos as a kid—it was one of my first jobs. It was a really weird, full-circle vindication of a dream. It was a really nice goodbye.&quot;

With the Matches on hiatus, Devoto fleshed out his acoustic project into a full band called Bird by Bird, while Harris and Grigg named their project Maniac. Between 2010 and 2011 Bird by Bird released two EPs and one full studio album titled &quot;While You Sleep.&quot; Maniac released one EP and one album. Harris then started a new project, Fortress Social Club, who released two albums and an EP in 2013; he followed that project with a solo effort under the name St. Ranger, releasing several singles and one full studio album titled &quot;Leaves L.A.,&quot; which was recorded while traveling with his wife across the U.S. in an Airstream trailer. Harris also continued to work as a visual artist, contributing to the album artwork of Bayside&#x27;s &quot;Shudder&quot; (2008) and Milo Greene&#x27;s &quot;Milo Greene&quot; (2012) and &quot;Control&quot; (2015), and finding critical success as illustrator and writer/illustrator of numerous children&#x27;s books including &quot;Her Right Foot,&quot; What Can A Citizen Do?, &quot;Have You Ever Seen a Flower,&quot; &quot;The First Cat in Space Ate Pizza,&quot; and &quot;The First Cat in Space and the Soup of Doom.&quot; After The Matches went on hiatus, Matt Whalen attended Columbia University and received his JD from The University of Texas School of Law, and is a practicing attorney.

===Reunions (2014–2018)===
In January 2014, Shawn Harris, Justin San Souci, Matt Whalen, and Jon Devoto met while all were back in Oakland. Their licensing deal with Epitaph Records for &quot;E. Von Dahl Killed the Locals&quot; had expired, so they decided to re-release it themselves as an LP record (the original releases had been in compact disc format) to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Epitaph release. They began teasing the release through social media, prompting inquiries and demand for a reunion concert. That May, they announced a one-time reunion show to take place in November at Slim&#x27;s in San Francisco. It sold out immediately, as did a second date added at Slim&#x27;s and a third at the Great American Music Hall. Due to the unexpected demand, further reunion shows were added in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. The re-release of &quot;E. Von Dahl Killed the Locals&quot; came out that September as a two-disc package, including both the original self-released version of the album and the re-mixed Epitaph version. The band ended up performing nine sold out shows in the United States, playing the album in its entirety as well as some later songs. Two performances at the Troubadour in Los Angeles were recorded, and released as the live album &quot;10YearsEVDKTL&quot; in December. This was followed by a five-date tour of Australia in January 2015.

In October 2015 the Matches released a new single, &quot;Life of a Match&quot;, with &quot;Crucial Comeback Song (Mary Claire)&quot; as the B-side. Harris and San Souci created the artwork for the single. A music video for &quot;Life of a Match&quot; was released, consisting of snippets of other bands&#x27; music videos as well as the Matches&#x27; own past ones. The band played two shows at the Fillmore that December. Harris started a solo surf rock project called St. Ranger, releasing the album &quot;Leaves L.A.&quot; in February 2016. Later that year, to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of &quot;Decomposer&quot;, the Matches re-released the album as a double LP; the second disc, titled &quot;Precomposer&quot;, consisted of demos the band had recorded while writing the album. That April they released an animated music video for the &quot;Decomposer&quot; song &quot;Little Maggots&quot;; they had begun work on the video in 2006 but left it unfinished. In May and June the Matches played three shows in Australia and five in the United States, performing &quot;Decomposer&quot; in full. A performance at the Teragram Ballroom in Los Angeles was recorded, and released digitally as the live album &quot;Recomposer&quot;.

The band next reconvened in 2018 for the ten year anniversary of &quot;A Band in Hope&quot;. As with their previous two records, they re-released the album as a double LP; the second disc, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Shake My Hand with Your Sunglasses On&quot;, collected demos and unreleased tracks associated with the album. The Matches played six shows in the United States performing &quot;A Band in Hope&quot; in full, and released a digital live album titled &quot;Aband1nh0pe&quot;. Meanwhile, filmmaker Chelsea Christer, who had filmed interviews with the band members to promote their 2014 reunion, expanded upon her footage to create a documentary film about the band, titled &quot;Bleeding Audio&quot;. The documentary, which features interviews with Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman, Tom Higgenson of Plain White T&#x27;s, and Justin Pierre of Motion City Soundtrack, finished filming in 2016. It was screened at several film festivals in 2020.

The production company released it unofficially.

<text>CSS &quot;Raleigh&quot; was originally a small, iron-hulled, propeller-driven towing steamer operating on the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal. She was taken over by the State of North Carolina in May 1861, and transferred to the Confederate States the following July. Her commanding officer during 1861–1862 was Lieutenant Joseph W. Alexander. Her entire service was in coastal waters of North Carolina and Virginia and in the James River as part of the James River Squadron.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; supported Fort Hatteras and Fort Clark on August 28–29, 1861; took part in an expedition on October 1 to capture United States Army steamer &quot;Fanny&quot; with valuable stores on board; and accompanied CSS &quot;Sea Bird&quot; when she reconnoitered Pamlico Sound on January 20, 1862. She was also active in defense of Roanoke Island against an amphibious assault by overwhelming Federal forces on February 7–8, 1862, and at Elizabeth City, North Carolina 2 days later. Thence &quot;Raleigh&quot; escaped through Dismal Swamp Canal to Norfolk, Virginia.

On March 8–9, 1862, &quot;Raleigh&quot; was tender to CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; during the historic Battle of Hampton Roads, for which she received the thanks of the Confederate Congress.

With the Federal recapture of Norfolk Navy Yard in May 1862, &quot;Raleigh&quot; steamed up the James River, but thereafter a shortage of crew members restricted her to flag-of-truce or patrol service.

&quot;Raleigh&quot;, renamed &quot;Roanoke&quot; near the end of the war, was destroyed by the Confederates on April 4, 1865 upon the evacuation of Richmond, Virginia.

== Commanders ==
The commanders of the CSS &quot;Raleigh&quot; were:

* Lieutenant Joseph W. Alexander (1861–1862)
* Lieutenant Maxwell T. Clarke (1863-June 1864)
* Lieutenant Mortimer Murray Benton (during June 1864)
* Master&#x27;s Mate A.E. Albertson (July 31, 1864-)
* Acting Master W. Frank Shippey (October–December 1864)
* Lieutenant William Wonder Pollock (January 1865-end of war)

The story reflects the aspirations and dreams of today&#x27;s youth, as they battle it out with conventions and norms to carve their own niche in the world. The screenplay and dialogues of the initial episodes were penned by Arif Ali and Sanyukta Chaudhuri.

==Plot==
The story revolves around a young girl named Pooja Mehta, who hails from a conservative middle-class Gujarati household in Mumbai. Pooja dreams of becoming a successful film director and idolises Karan Johar.

To realise her dream, Pooja secretly joins a coveted film studies course at the trendy St. Martin&#x27;s College, keeping her father in the dark. At the college, the simple and straightforward Pooja instantly comes face to face with the hip and high-class students of St. Martins&#x27;s and is made intensely aware of her middle-class looks and attitude. She is ill-treated by the well-to-do English speaking students who label her as &#x27;vernacular&#x27; as she speaks in her Gujarati tone and accent. The story revolves around her college life as she gradually wins over her classmates, makes new friends and successfully completes her course.

Later, the story shifts to Pooja&#x27;s life after college as she starts the new chapter in her life as an independent working woman. Her sister, Poornima falls in love with and marries Ronit. Young and rich businessman Ashmit woos Pooja and they get married. Pooja soon discovers that Ashmit, supposedly Ronit&#x27;s step-brother, is in fact an impostor who kills Poornima to keep his secret safe. Eventually, Ashmit is arrested and is sent to prison.

<doc id="1246785" wikidata="Q333653" url="?curid=1246785" title="Quim Monzó">
<text>Joaquim Monzó i Gómez (born 15 March 1952), also known as Quim Monzó (), is a contemporary Spanish writer of novels, short stories and discursive prose, mostly in Catalan. In the early 1970s, Monzó reported from Vietnam, Cambodia, Northern Ireland and East Africa for the Barcelona newspaper &quot;Tele/eXpres&quot;. He was one of the members of the Catalan literary collective, &quot;Ofèlia Dracs&quot;. He lives in Barcelona and publishes regularly in &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;.

His fiction is characterized by an awareness of pop culture and irony. His other prose maintains this humor. One collection of his essays, &quot;Catorze ciutats comptant-hi Brooklyn&quot;, is notable for its account of New York City in the days immediately following September 11. In collaboration with Cuca Canals, he wrote the dialogue for Bigas Luna&#x27;s &quot;Jamón, jamón&quot;. He has also written &quot;El tango de Don Joan&quot;, with Jérôme Savary.

In 2007 he wrote and read the opening speech at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the year in which Catalan culture was the guest. Monzó designed an acclaimed lecture written as if it were a short story, thus differing completely from a traditional speech. From December 2009 to April 2010 there took place in the Arts Santa Mònica Gallery in Barcelona a great retrospective exhibition on his life and his work, called &quot;Monzó&quot;.

<text>Mosses from an Old Manse is a short story collection by Nathaniel Hawthorne, first published in 1846.

==Background and publication history==
The collection includes several previously published short stories, and was named in honor of The Old Manse where Hawthorne and his wife lived for the first three years of their marriage. The first edition was published in 1846.

Hawthorne seems to have been paid $75 for the publication.

==Analysis==
Many of the tales collected in &quot;Mosses from an Old Manse&quot; are allegories and, typical of Hawthorne, focus on the negative side of human nature. Hawthorne&#x27;s friend Herman Melville noted this aspect in his review &quot;Hawthorne and His Mosses&quot;:
William Henry Channing noted in his review of the collection, in &quot;The Harbinger&quot;, its author &quot;had been baptized in the deep waters of &quot;Tragedy&quot;&quot;, and his work was dark with only brief moments of &quot;serene brightness&quot; which was never brighter than &quot;dusky twilight&quot;.

==Critical reception==
After the book&#x27;s first publication, Hawthorne sent copies to critics including Margaret Fuller, Rufus Wilmot Griswold, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry Theodore Tuckerman. Poe responded with a lengthy review in which he praised Hawthorne&#x27;s writing but faulted him for associating with New England journals, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the Transcendentalists. He wrote, &quot;Let him mend his pen, get a bottle of visible ink, come out from the Old Manse, cut Mr. Alcott, hang (if possible) the editor of &#x27;The Dial,&#x27; and throw out of the window to the pigs all his odd numbers of the &quot;North American Review&quot;.&quot; 
A young Walt Whitman wrote that Hawthorne was underpaid, and it was unfair that his book competed with imported European books. He asked, &quot;Shall real American genius shiver with neglect while the public runs after this foreign trash?&quot; Generally, most contemporary critics praised the collection and considered it better than Hawthorne&#x27;s earlier collection, &quot;Twice-Told Tales&quot;.

Regarding the second edition, published in 1854, Hawthorne wrote to publisher James T. Fields that he no longer understood the messages he was sending in these stories. He shared, &quot;I remember that I always had a meaning—or, at least, thought I had&quot;, and noted &quot;Upon my honor, I am not quite sure that I entirely comprehend my own meaning in some of these blasted allegories... I am a good deal changed since those times; and to tell you the truth, my past self is not very much to my taste, as I see in this book.&quot;

<doc id="1246795" wikidata="Q858157" url="?curid=1246795" title="German folklore">
<text>German folklore is the folk tradition which has developed in Germany over a number of centuries. Seeing as Germany was divided into numerous polities for most of its history, this term might both refer to the folklore of Germany proper and of all German-speaking countries, this wider definition including folklore of Austria and Liechtenstein as well as the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Italy.

== Characteristics ==
It shares many characteristics with Nordic folklore and English folklore due to their origins in a common Germanic mythology. It reflects a similar mix of influences: a pre-Christian pantheon and other beings equivalent to those of Norse mythology; magical characters (sometimes recognizably pre-Christian) associated with Christian festivals, and various regional &#x27;character&#x27; stories.

As in Scandinavia, when belief in the old gods disappeared, remnants of the mythos persisted: There are:
* Frau Holle or Perchta, a &quot;supernatural&quot; patron of spinning and leader of the Wild Hunt (in German folklore preceded by an old man, Honest Eckart, who warns others of its approach) or of the Heimchen
* solitary wild huntsmen such as the ewiger Jäger or the Türst
* the Lorelei, a dangerous Rhine siren derived from 19th-century literature, among other nixies such as the Rhinemaidens
* the Weiße Frauen and Witte Wiwer, white female spirits
* the Doppelgänger, supernatural beings said to resemble the exactly similar appearance of determined person
* the giant Rübezahl
* the mining sprite Bergmönch
* wood sprites such as the tiny Moss people and their matriarch Buschgroßmutter, or the man-eating Fänggen
* nightmare-causing Alp, mare, and Drude
* the banshee Klagmuhme
* undead Nachzehrer and Wiedergänger
* ghostly Feuermann, Hemann, and Uhaml
* changeling legends
and many more generic entities such as the elf, dwarf, Kobold (with variants such as Bieresel, Gütel, Heinzelmännchen, Jack o&#x27; the bowl, and Niß Puk), Klabautermann, Schrat, Wild man, Drak, Aufhocker, Ork, poltergeist, bogeyman, Will-o&#x27;-the-wisp, various Feldgeister, and Erlking. Famous individual Kobolds are King Goldemar, Hinzelmann, Hödekin, and Petermännchen.

There further are mythical animals such as Bahkauv, Beerwolf, Elwetritsch, Erdhenne, lindworm, Nachtkrapp, Rasselbock, Tatzelwurm, and Wolpertinger, or mythical plants such as Alraune and Irrwurz.

Popular folklore includes Krampus, Belsnickel, and Knecht Ruprecht, a rough companion to Santa Claus; the Lutzelfrau, a Yule witch who must be appeased with small presents; the Christkind; the Osterhase (Easter Hare – the original Easter Bunny); and Walpurgisnacht, a spring festival derived from pagan customs.

Character folklore includes the stories of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, the Godfather Death, the trickster hero Till Eulenspiegel, the Town Musicians of Bremen and Faust.

== History ==
Documentation and preservation of folklore in the states that formally united as Germany in 1871 was initially fostered in the 18th and 19th centuries. As early as 1851, author Bernhard Baader published a collection of folklore research obtained by oral history, called &quot;Volkssagen aus dem Lande Baden und den angrenzenden Gegenden&quot;. The Saxon author Johann Karl August Musäus (1735–1787) was another early collector.

Study was further promoted by the Prussian poet and philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder. His belief in the role of folklore in ethnic nationalism – a folklore of Germany as a nation rather than of disunited German-speaking peoples – inspired the Brothers Grimm, Goethe and others. For instance, folklore elements, such as the Rhine Maidens and the Grimms&#x27; &quot;The Story of a Boy Who Went Forth to Learn Fear&quot;, formed part of the source material for Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen.

Some of the works of Washington Irving – notably &quot;Rip van Winkle&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; – are based on German folktales.

Within Germany, the nationalistic aspect was further emphasized during the National Socialist era. James R. Dow has written that under National Socialism, &quot;folklore became a propaganda instrument of anti-democratic, anti-socialist, and extremely inhumane terrorist policies&quot;. Folklore studies, &quot;Volkskunde&quot;, were co-opted as a political tool, to seek out traditional customs to support the idea of historical continuity with a Germanic culture. Anti-Semitic folklore such as the blood libel legend was also emphasized.

<text>The marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is a small seabird from the North Pacific. It is a member of the family Alcidae, which includes auklets, guillemots, murres and puffins. It nests in old-growth forests or on the ground at higher latitudes where trees cannot grow. Its population has declined since humans began logging its nest trees in the latter half of the 19th century. The decline of the marbled murrelet and its association with old-growth forests—at least in the southern part of its range—have made it a flagship species in the forest protection movement.

==Taxonomy==
The marbled murrelet was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the grebes and loons in the genus &quot;Colymbus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Colymbus marmoratus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;marbled murrelet&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1785 by both the English ornithologist John Latham and by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant. Both authors mention the two specimens in the Leverian Museum that had been collected in Prince William Sound during James Cook&#x27;s third voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Cook described the birds in his account of the voyage.
It is about the size of a partridge; has a short, black, compressed bill; with the head and upper part of the neck of a brown black; the rest of a deep brown, obscurely waved with black, except the underpart, which is entirely of a blackish cast, very minutely varied with white; the other (perhaps the female) is blacker above, and whiter below. The marbled murrelet is now one of three species placed in the genus &quot;Brachyramphus&quot; that was introduced in 1837 by the German born naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt. The genus name combines Ancient Greek &quot;brakhus&quot; meaning &quot;short&quot; with &quot;rhamphos&quot; meaning &quot;bill&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;marmoratus&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;marbled&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The long-billed murrelet was formerly considered conspecific with the marbled murrelet. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 1998 found that the mitochondrial DNA variation was greater between these two forms than between the marbled murrelet and Kittlitz&#x27;s murrelet.

==Description==

The marbled murrelet is a small (25 cm), chunky auk with a slender black bill. It has pointed wings and plumage that varies by season. The non-breeding plumage is typically white underneath with a black crown, nape, wings and back. The bird closely resembles its congener, the long-billed murrelet; in fact, these species were considered conspecific up until 1998. In breeding plumage, both have a brown mottled body and face. The long-billed has a pale white throat which is lacking in the marbled. In winter plumage, the marbled murrelet has a white neck collar, absent in long-billed. The marbled murrelet is shorter-billed and slightly smaller than the long-billed murrelet.

==Distribution and habitat==
Marbled murrelets occur in summer from Alaska&#x27;s Kenai Peninsula, Barren islands, and Aleutian Islands south along the coast of North America to Point Sal, Santa Barbara County, in south-central California. They winter mostly within the same general area, except that they tend to vacate the most northern sections of their range, especially where ice forms on the surface of the fiords. They have been recorded as far south as Imperial Beach of San Diego County, California.

They are coastal birds that occur mainly near saltwater within 1.2 miles (2 km) of shore. However, they have been found up to 59 miles (95 km) inland in Washington, 35 miles (56 km) inland in Oregon, 22 miles (37 km) inland in northern California, and 11 miles (18 km) inland in central California. Over 90% of all marbled murrelet observations in the northern Washington Cascades were within 37 miles (60 km) of the coast. In Oregon, they are observed most often within 12 miles (20 km) of the ocean. Many marbled murrelets regularly visit coastal lakes. Most lakes used by the birds are within 12 miles (20 km) of the ocean, but a few birds have been found at lakes as far inland as 47 miles (75 km). All lakes used by marbled murrelets occur within potential nesting habitat.

===Nesting habitat===
From southeast Alaska southward, marbled murrelets use mature or old-growth forest stands near the coastline for nesting. These forests are generally characterized by large trees (&gt;32 inches [80 cm] diameter at breast height (d.b.h.)), a multistoried canopy, moderate to high canopy closure or an open crown canopy, large snags, and numerous downed snags in all stages of decay. Marbled murrelets tend to nest in the oldest trees in the stand. In Oregon, forests begin to exhibit old-growth characteristics at about 175 to 250 years of age. Moss, on which marbled murrelets nest, forms on the limbs of Douglas-fir that are more than 150 years old.

The four tree nests found before 1990 shared the following characteristics: (1) located in a large tree (&gt;47 inches [120 cm] d.b.h.) with an open crown structure, (2) on a moss-covered limb that is camouflaged, partially shaded, and approximately horizontal with a diameter (including associated moss) of at least 14 inches (36 cm), and (3) located within the middle or lower part of a live crown. However, Marshall stated that because of their low aerial buoyancy marbled murrelets often nest high in the treetops or on steep slopes. Habitat must be sufficiently open to allow for easy flight. All marbled murrelet nests found in Washington, Oregon, and California were located in old-growth trees that ranged from 38 inches (88 cm) d.b.h. to 210 inches (533 cm) d.b.h. with a mean of 80 inches (203 cm) d.b.h. Nests were located high above the ground and had good overhead protection but allowed easy access to the exterior forest. It was initially believed that marbled murrelets might use the same nest in successive years but there has been little evidence of this.

Stand size is also important in nest sites. Marbled murrelets more commonly occupy stands greater than 500 acres (202 ha) than stands less than 100 acres (40 ha). However, they may nest in remnant old-growth trees or groves that are surrounded by younger trees. In California, marbled murrelets are usually absent from stands less than 60 acres (24 ha) in size. In Washington, marbled murrelets are found more often when old-growth and mature forests make up over 30% of the landscape. Fewer marbled murrelets are found when clearcut and meadow areas make up more than 25% of the landscape. Concentrations of marbled murrelets offshore are almost always adjacent to old-growth or mature forests onshore, although marbled murrelets may not use the interior of dense stands.

Where large trees are absent in the northern parts of marbled murrelet range, marbled murrelets nest in depressions on the ground, in rock cavities on the ground, or on rock outcrops. Marbled murrelets are both ground nesters and tree nesters where forests and treeless areas meet.

In northern regions where coniferous forests nest sites are unavailable, marbled murrelets occupy alpine or tundra near the ocean. In Washington and Oregon, they commonly nest in Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;) dominated stands. They also select stands dominated by mountain hemlock (&quot;Tsuga mertensiana&quot;), western redcedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;), and Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;) for nesting. In California, nests are most often located in redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) dominated stands with scattered Sitka spruce, western hemlock (&quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot;) and Douglas-fir. Marbled murrelets also occur in stands dominated by Port-Orford-cedar (&quot;Chamaecyparis lawsoniana&quot;).

===Foraging habitat===
Marbled murrelets forage in the ocean near shore and in inland saltwater areas such as bays, sounds, and saltwater passageways. Some also forage on inland freshwater lakes. Flocks of 50 or more birds have been observed near freshwater lakes. Subadults occur at sea throughout the summer. Marbled murrelets feed within 1,640 feet (500 m) of shore.

===Winter habitat===

Marbled murrelet winter habitat is the same as the nesting and foraging habitat. During the winter marbled murrelets use inland old-growth or mature sites for roosting, courtship, and investigating nest sites. The use of inland lakes during the nonbreeding season occurs in conjunction with visits to nesting areas.

==Behavior==
===Food and feeding===
The marbled murrelet feeds at sea both in pelagic offshore areas (often associating with upwellings) and inshore in protected bays and fiords. The bird has not been known to wander from the Pacific coast of North America, all inland and eastern &quot;Brachyramphus&quot; records being of the closely related long-billed murrelet.

They feed below the water surface on small fish and invertebrates. Some principal foods include sand lance (&quot;Ammodytes hexapterus&quot;), Pacific herring (&quot;Clupea haringus&quot;), capelin (&quot;Mallotus villosus&quot;), shiner perch, and the invertebrates &quot;Euphausia pacifica&quot; and &quot;Thysanoessa spinifera&quot;.

They often forage in pairs but do not feed in large flocks as do other alcids. Loose aggregations of 500 or more birds occasionally occur in winter. Subadults feed singly; but in early July, when pairs of adults are still feeding young, mixed flocks begin to form. Marbled murrelets feed during the day and at night.

===Breeding===

The nesting behavior of the marbled murrelet is unusual, since unlike most alcids it does not nest in colonies on cliffs or in burrows, but on branches of old-growth and mature conifers such as western hemlock, Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir and coastal redwood, as far as 80 km inland. It lays one egg on a platform of lichen or moss on these branches (less often on the ground). In northern populations, murrelets nest on the ground among rocks, as do other related murrelet species. The egg is incubated for a month, then fed for around 40 days until the chick is able to fledge. Adults fly from ocean feeding areas to inland nest sites, mostly at dusk and dawn. They feed nestlings at least once and sometimes twice per day or night. Usually only one fish is carried to the young. The chick then leaves the nest and flies unaccompanied to the sea. Breeding success is low and chick mortality high.

Marbled murrelets do not breed until they are at least two years old. They nest from mid-April to late September. Peak activity occurs from mid-June to late July in California, and the second week of July to mid-August in Oregon. Marbled murrelets are semicolonial in nesting habits. Two nests found in Washington were located only 150 feet (46 m) apart. Not all mature adults nest every year. The clutch is a single egg. The nestlings fledge in 28 days. The young remain in the nest longer than other alcids and molt into their juvenile plumage before leaving the nest. Fledglings fly directly from the nest to the ocean.

==Predators==
Steller&#x27;s jays (&quot;Cyanocitta stelleri&quot;) and common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;) prey on marbled murrelet eggs and nestlings.

== Status and Conservation ==

=== Status ===
The marbled murrelet is considered globally endangered. The IUCN Red List lists their population as declining. 

=== Conservation ===
Marbled murrelet populations are affected by many environmental processes. Cooler ocean temperatures along with high availability of their prey increases their reproductive success. Loss of their nesting habitat in old-growth trees along with the warming ocean temperatures have serious negative impacts on murrelet populations. Human activity such as commercial fishing, increased boat traffic and pollution decrease the Marbled murrelet non-breeding distribution. Conservation of their inland nesting habitat and their marine breeding and foraging habitats is therefore important.

The Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) aims at stabilizing the marbled murrelet population via maintaining and increasing their nesting habitat. The population was monitored from 2000 to 2018 and was found to have declined in Washington but increased in Oregon and northern California. This decline in the north could be attributed to habitat loss, long nest-to-sea commutes, or poor foraging habitats in Washington.

Scientists at Redwood National Park have established a connection between human presence in marbled murrelet territory and corvid predation of marbled murrelet chicks.

<text>Leonid Fyodorovich Myasin (), better known in the West by the French transliteration as Léonide Massine (15 March 1979), was a Russian choreographer and ballet dancer. Massine created the world&#x27;s first symphonic ballet, &quot;Les Présages&quot;, and many others in the same vein. Besides his &quot;symphonic ballets,&quot; Massine choreographed many other popular works during his long career, some of which were serious and dramatic, and others lighthearted and romantic. He created some of his most famous roles in his own comic works, among them the Can-Can Dancer in &quot;La Boutique fantasque&quot; (1919), the Hussar in &quot;Le Beau Danube&quot; (1924), and, perhaps best known of all, the Peruvian in &quot;Gaîté Parisienne&quot; (1938). Today his oeuvre is represented by his son Lorca Massine, who stages his works around the world.

== Early life and education ==
Massine was born into a musical family on 9 August 1896 in Moscow, Russia. His mother was a soprano in the Bolshoi Theater Chorus and his father played the French horn in the Bolshoi Theater Orchestra. Leonid was one of five children. He had three brothers, Mikhail, Gregori, and Konstantin — as well as one sister — Raissa. Due to their small age difference, Leonid and Konstantin were very close during childhood. Beginning when Leonid was seven, the Massine family spent most summers at their summer &quot;dacha&quot; in Zvenigorod-Moskovsky.

In 1904, Leonid successfully auditioned for the Moscow Imperial Theater School. At only eight years old, he began his formal dance training. The next year, the director of the Bolshoi Theater, Alexander Gorsky, was looking for a small boy to play the role of Chernomor in the ballet &quot;Ruslan and Ludmilla.&quot; Leonid was selected for the role. This performance and rehearsal period ignited his lifelong passion for acting. Leonid was selected for three more professional roles at the Bolshoi and Maly Theaters through the 1908–1909 season.

In 1909, Konstantin was killed during a hunting accident. Leonid never seemed to fully recover from the shock and devastation of this personal tragedy.

In August 1913, Massine graduated from the Moscow Imperial Theater School and almost immediately joined the Bolshoi Ballet. In December of the same year, Sergei Diaghilev came to Moscow in search of a dancer for a new production of &quot;The Legend of Joseph.&quot; His favorite Vaslav Nijinsky had originally been cast in the role, but Diaghilev terminated Nijinsky&#x27;s contract upon his marriage to Romola de Pulszky. Diaghilev was attracted to Massine&#x27;s onstage presence and acting, and invited him to audition for the choreographer, Mikhail Fokine. After the audition in St. Petersburg, Massine joined Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes.

== Ballets Russes ==
From 1915 to 1921 Massine was the principal choreographer of Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes.

Following the departure of Vaslav Nijinsky, the company&#x27;s first male star, Massine became the preeminent male star and took over Nijinsky&#x27;s roles. His first ballet, in 1915, called &quot;Le Soleil de Nuit&quot;, used Russian folklore elements. 
The ballet &quot;Parade&quot; premiered at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, on 18 May 1917. The ballet is based on a libretto by Jean Cocteau. &quot;Parade&quot; is about a group of circus performers trying to lure a reluctant audience into the tent before the show begins. The sets and costume designs were by Pablo Picasso, who designed large cubist structures for the dancers to wear. The score was composed by Erik Satie, who used sounds from an airplane&#x27;s engine, pistol shots, and a ship&#x27;s siren to accompany the music.
&quot;Le Tricorn,&quot; better known as &quot;The Three Cornered Hat,&quot; premiered at the Alhambra Theater in London, on 22 July 1919. Manuel de Falla composed the score and Pablo Picasso designed the sets and costumes. Massine&#x27;s collaborators, all Spanish, helped to make this ballet more authentic to its subject matter. &quot;Le Tricorn&quot; was a triumphant success. The story was inspired by the novel &quot;El sombrero de tres picos&quot; (1874) by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón. In order to authentically depict the Spanish character dances, Massine carefully studied the authentic Spanish character dance style.

== Col. de Basil&#x27;s Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo ==
When George Balanchine left de Basil&#x27;s company in 1933, Massine replaced him as resident choreographer. Massine&#x27;s ballets during this period were reminiscent of Fyodor Lopukhov&#x27;s Tanzsymphonia, in that an emphasis on the music drove the choreography. He continued to use symphonic music by well-known composers.

In 1932 he created &quot;&quot; to libretto by Boris Kochno, scenic design was by Joan Miró. In 1933, Massine created the world&#x27;s first symphonic ballet, &quot;Les Présages&quot;, using Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Symphony No. 5. This caused a furor amongst musical purists, who objected to a serious symphonic work being used as the basis of a ballet. Undeterred, Massine continued work on &quot;Choreartium,&quot; set to Brahms&#x27; Fourth Symphony, which had its premiere on 24 October 1933 at the Alhambra Theatre in London. Massine also choreographed a ballet to Hector Berlioz&#x27;s 1830 &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot; and danced the role of The Young Musician with Tamara Toumanova as The Beloved at its premiere at Covent Garden, London, on 24 July 1936 with Colonel Wassily de Basil&#x27;s Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.

== Massine &amp; Blum&#x27;s Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo ==
Leaving Col. de Basil&#x27;s company, in 1937 Massine and René Blum (himself a former associate of de Basil&#x27;s) acquired financing from Julius Fleischmann, Jr.&#x27;s World Art, Inc. to create a new ballet company, with Massine as the resident choreographer. Massine soon discovered that the ballets he had choreographed while under contract with Col. de Basil were owned by his company. Massine sued Col. de Basil in London to regain the intellectual property rights to his own works. He also sued to claim the &quot;Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo&quot; name. The jury decided that Col. de Basil owned Massine&#x27;s ballets created between 1932 and 1937, but not those created before 1932. It also ruled that both successor companies could use the name &quot;Ballet Russe&quot; — but only Massine &amp; Blum&#x27;s company could be called &quot;Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo&quot;. Col. de Basil finally settled on the &quot;Original Ballet Russe&quot;.

The new Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo debuted in 1938; Massine choreographed &quot;Gaîté Parisienne&quot;, set to music by Jacques Offenbach, which premiered on 5 April at the Théâtre de Monte Carlo. &quot;Gaîté Parisienne&quot; was one of Massine&#x27;s most celebrated works during this time. Instead of a whole, singular composition for the score, Offenbach created a series of divertissements. This allowed Massine to use a wide variety of dancers and tempi, all while conveying a single narrative. Massine revived the piece for American Ballet Theatre in 1970. Lorca Massine and Susanna della Pietra mounted an additional revival for ABT in 1988. In this production, the costumes were designed by Christian Lacroix, who created animated and eccentric costumes based on his own 1987 haute couture collection.

A month after premiering &quot;Gaîté Parisienne&quot; Massine produced &quot;Seventh Symphony,&quot; to Beethoven&#x27;s score. It premiered on 5 May 1938 in Monte Carlo, with Alicia Markova, Nini Theilade, Frederic Franklin, and Igor Youskevitch as the principal dancers.

Massine left Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1943.

==San Francisco Bay Area==
In 1977 Massine moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to begin a series of choreographic workshops, as well as revive his work &quot;Le Beau Danube&quot; for the Marin Ballet. At the same time, Massine was working on plans for &quot;Parisina,&quot; which was to be performed by Natalia Makarova. However, Makarova began to suspect her part was originated on another dancer and pulled out of the project. Massine was appointed resident choreographer of the Marin Ballet. He began work on a new production of &quot;The Nutcracker,&quot; which was never seen outside the studio.

== Film work ==
Massine appeared in two feature-length films by the British directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger: &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (1951). He also had a cameo appearance in Powell&#x27;s later film &quot;Honeymoon&quot; (1959). Massine starred in several films of ballet short subjects. For Warner Brothers, he starred with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in a short Technicolor film of his ballet &quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot;, entitled &quot;Spanish Fiesta&quot; (1942). He choreographed and danced in the 1947 20th Century Fox color film &quot;Carnival in Costa Rica&quot;, and also choreographed and appeared as Pulcinella in the film &quot;Carosello Napoletano&quot;.
In 1941, Warner Bros made an attempt at a film version of the ballet of &quot;Gaîté Parisienne,&quot; entitled &quot;The Gay Parisian.&quot; The attempt was not well received, partly due to the fact that the signature role, played by Alexandra Danilova in the original work, was recast with a lesser dancer, Milada Mladova.

== Personal life ==
In his youth, Massine was the protégé and lover of Diaghilev. In later life he enjoyed numerous love affairs with beautiful women and had four wives. His first two wives, Vera Savina (née Vera Clark) and Eugenia Delarova, were both ballet dancers. With his third wife, Tatiana Orlova, he had two children, a son, Leonide Massine II (who later changed his name to &quot;Lorca Massine&quot;), and a daughter, Tatiania. He and Orlova divorced in 1968. He subsequently married Hannelore Holtwick, with whom he had two sons, Peter and Theodor, and made his home in Borken, West Germany, where he died on 15 March 1979.

In 1968 Massine published his autobiography, entitled &quot;My Life in Ballet&quot;.

== Awards ==
Massine was inducted into the National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame in 2002.

<doc id="1246806" wikidata="Q565543" url="?curid=1246806" title="Hieronymus Praetorius">
<text>Hieronymus Praetorius (10 August 1560 – 27 January 1629) was a Northern German composer and organist of the late Renaissance and early Baroque whose polychoral motets in 8 to 20 voices are intricate and vividly expressive. Some of his organ music survives in the Visby Orgel-Tabulatur, which dates from 1611. (He was not related to the prolific Michael Praetorius, known as a theorist and for &quot;Terpsichore&quot;, but the large Praetorius family tree produced many distinguished musicians during the 16th and 17th centuries.)

==Life==
He was born in Hamburg and spent most of his life there. He studied organ with his father (Jacob Praetorius, the elder (1520-1586), also a composer), before moving to Cologne for further study. In 1580 he became organist in Erfurt but remained there only two years. After returning to Hamburg in 1582 he worked with his father as assistant organist at Sankt Jacobi, becoming principal organist in 1586 when his father died, a post he retained until his own death 43 years later. His son, Jacob, was born that same year, and was also destined to become a composer. His younger son Johann was also a composer and organist. In 1596 Hieronymus visited Gröningen where he met Michael Praetorius and Hans Leo Hassler; presumably he became acquainted with their music and, through them, the music of the contemporary Venetian School.

==Music and influence==

Praetorius wrote Masses and ten settings of the Magnificat in addition to the mostly Latin polychoral motets. Much of his music uses voices divided into several groups, probably the first of its kind in Northern Germany in polychoral style; choir sizes range from 8 to 20, with the voices divided into two, three or four groups. Praetorius must have had sophisticated musicians at his disposal, considering both the amount and the difficulty of music he wrote for these ensembles. While progressive in writing in the Venetian style, he was conservative in using Latin and avoiding the basso continuo, which was eagerly adopted by many other contemporary German composers. Most of his vocal music is &quot;a cappella&quot;. 

Praetorius was also the first composer to compile a collection of four-part German chorales with organ accompaniment, a sound which was to become a standard in Protestant churches for several centuries. The music in the collection was compiled from four churches in Hamburg; 21 of the 88 settings are of his own composition. Some of his organ compositions survive, including nine settings of the Magnificat, which are in a highly contrapuntal cantus firmus style. In addition to these settings, numerous anonymous pieces in north German collections of the time are now attributed with reasonable certainty to Hieronymus Praetorius.

<text>A humidifier is a household appliance or device designed to increase the moisture level in the air within a room or an enclosed space. It achieves this by emitting water droplets or steam into the surrounding air, thereby raising the humidity.

In the home, point-of-use humidifiers are commonly used to humidify a single room, while whole-house or furnace humidifiers, which connect to a home&#x27;s HVAC system, provide humidity to the entire house. Medical ventilators often include humidifiers for increased patient comfort. Large humidifiers are used in commercial, institutional, or industrial contexts, often as part of a larger HVAC system.

==Overview==

===Humidification calculation===
: Humidity per hour: X = &quot;Air changes per hour (ACPH) * M³ * density of air * humidity ratio&quot;
:: Humidity per day: X * 24

* The air changes per hour (ACPH) ranges wildly based on:
** Ventilation: Values may be obtained from the HVAC maintainer that routinely (typically every third year or so) tests the ventilation of the residence.
** Insulation leakage: Measured with a standard blower door test.
* Cubic meters: The volume of the room, excluding the bathroom that should be kept closed since it ventilates humidity.
* Density of air: Typically 1.2 for dry air.
* Humidity
** Current relative humidity: 20%
** Humidity needed to reach 55%: 35%
*** Humidity ratio for 35%: 0.0051

For example, a typical modern apartment of with closed windows (wood isolation) may consume to raise the relative humidity from 20% to 55%: 24 * 1,53 L/h (2*1×125×1.2×0.0051):
* Air changes per hour
** Ventilation: 2
** Insulation leakage: 1 (a few windows)
* Cubic meters: 125 m3 (50 m2 * 2.5 m height)
* Density of air: Typically 1.2 for dry air.
* Humidity
** Current relative humidity: 20%
** Humidity needed to reach 55%: 35%
*** Humidity ratio for 35%: 0.0051

===Prevention of low indoor humidity===
Low humidity may occur in hot, dry desert climates, or indoors in artificially heated spaces. In winter, especially when cold outside air is heated indoors, the humidity may drop to as low as 10–20%. A relative humidity of 30% to 50% is recommended for most homes.

====Health treatment====
* Prevention of dermatitis: Low humidity can cause adverse health effects and may cause atopic dermatitis, and seborrhoeic dermatitis.
** Management of hair loss: Commonly, patients with seborrhoeic dermatitis experience mild redness, scaly skin lesions and in some cases hair loss.
* Prevention of dry mucous membranes and cough: By drying out mucous membranes such as the lining of the nose and throat, it may also lead to a snoring problem, and can cause respiratory distress.
* Prevention of dry eye syndrome.
* Improved apparent temperature: The heat index and humidex measure the effect of humidity on the perception of temperatures above . In humid conditions, the air feels much hotter, because less perspiration evaporates from the skin.

====Improved climate for material====
Low humidity can affect wooden furniture, causing shrinkage and loose joints or cracking of pieces. Books, papers, and artworks may shrink or warp and become brittle in very low humidity.

In addition, static electricity may become a problem in conditions of low humidity, destroying semiconductor devices, causing static cling of textiles, and causing dust and small particles to stick stubbornly to electrically charged surfaces.

===Negative impact of overuse of humidifiers===
An indoor relative humidity of less than 51% resulted in significant reductions in mite and allergen levels. Overuse of a humidifier can raise the relative humidity to excessive levels, promoting the growth of dust mites and mold, and can also cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis (humidifier lung). A properly installed and located hygrostat should be used to monitor and control humidity levels automatically, or a well-informed and conscientious human operator must constantly check for correct humidity levels.

A humidity below 50% can prevent water condensation on building materials.

A dehumidifier can be used to balance the humidity.

== Humidifiers ==
Industrial humidifiers are used when a specific humidity level must be maintained to prevent static electricity buildup, preserve material properties, and ensure a comfortable and healthy environment for workers or residents.

Static problems are prevalent in industries such as packaging, printing, paper, plastics, textiles, electronics, automotive manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. Friction can produce static buildup and sparks when humidity is below 45% relative humidity (RH). Between 45% and 55% RH, static builds up at reduced levels, while humidity above 55% RH ensures that static will never build up. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) has traditionally recommended a range of 45–55% RH in data centers to prevent sparks that can damage IT equipment. Humidifiers are also used by manufacturers of semiconductors and in hospital operating rooms.

Printers and paper manufacturers use humidifiers to prevent shrinkage and paper curl. Humidifiers are needed in cold storage rooms to preserve the freshness of food against the dryness caused by hot temperatures. Art museums use humidifiers to protect sensitive works of art, especially in exhibition galleries, where they combat the dryness caused by heating for the comfort of visitors during winter.

== Natural humidifiers ==
Natural humidifiers don&#x27;t use or need a demineralization filter because the water is slowly evaporated which leaves the mineral deposit at the bottom of the container. However, natural humidifiers raise the humidity very slowly even if their water surface area is large.

===Common sources===
* Human water losses, both respiratory, and insensible water loss like sweat, range in average 0.75 L/d in sedentary adults. However, most people do not spend most of the day at home.
* Houseplants may also be used as natural humidifiers, especially if they are placed in fabric flowerpots, since they evaporate water into the air through transpiration. Care must still be taken to prevent bacteria or mold in the soil from growing to excessive levels, or from dispersing into the air. The presence of sciarids (like fungus gnats) in houseplants may indicate overwatering.
* Hanging laundry will increase the humidity.

===Homemade===
One type of evaporative humidifier makes use of just a reservoir and . Sometimes called a &quot;natural humidifier&quot;, these are usually non-commercial devices that can be assembled at little or no cost.

One version of a natural humidifier uses a stainless steel bowl, partially filled with water, covered by a towel. A waterproof weight is used to sink the towel in the center of the bowl. There is no need for a fan, because the water spreads through the towel by capillary action and the towel surface area is large enough to provide for rapid evaporation. The stainless steel bowl is much easier to clean than typical humidifier water tanks. This, in combination with daily or every other day replacement of the towel and periodic laundering, can control the problem of mold and bacteria.

==Electric humidifiers==

===Evaporative humidifiers ===
An &quot;evaporative&quot;, &quot;cool moisture&quot;, or &quot;wick humidifier&quot;, consists of just three basic parts: a reservoir, a wick, and a fan.

The wick is made of a porous material that absorbs water from the reservoir and provides a larger surface area for it to evaporate from. The fan is adjacent to the wick and blows air onto the wet wick to aid in the evaporation of the water. Evaporation from the wick is dependent on relative humidity. A room with low humidity will have a higher evaporation rate compared to a room with high humidity. Therefore, this type of humidifier is partially self-regulating; as the humidity of the room increases, the water vapor output naturally decreases.

These wicks become moldy if they are not dried out completely between fillings, and become saturated with mineral deposits over time. They regularly need rinsing or replacement; if this does not happen, air cannot pass through them, and humidifier stops humidifying the area it is in and the water in the tank remains at the same level.

Evaporative humidifiers function similarly to evaporative coolers.

===Impeller humidifiers ===
Impeller humidifiers (a type of cool mist humidifier) are usually noisier than others. It uses a rotating disc to fling water at a diffuser, which breaks the water into fine droplets that float into the air. The water supply must be kept scrupulously clean, or there is a risk of spreading bacteria or mold into the air.

===Ultrasonic humidifiers ===

An ultrasonic humidifier uses a ceramic diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency to create water droplets that silently exit the humidifier in the form of cool fog. Usually the mist gets forced out by a tiny fan, while some ultra mini models have no fans. The models without fans are meant mainly for personal use. Ultrasonic humidifiers use a piezoelectric transducer to create a high frequency (1-2 MHz) mechanical oscillation in a film of water. This forms an extremely fine mist of droplets about one micron in diameter, that is quickly evaporated into the air flow.

Unlike the humidifiers that boil water, these water droplets will contain any impurities that are in the reservoir, including minerals from hard water (which then forms a difficult-to-remove sticky white dust on nearby objects and furniture). Any pathogens growing in the stagnant tank will also be dispersed in the air. Ultrasonic humidifiers should be cleaned regularly to prevent bacterial contamination from being spread throughout the air.

The amount of minerals and other materials can be greatly reduced by using distilled water. Special disposable demineralization cartridges may also reduce the amount of airborne material, but the EPA warns, &quot;the ability of these devices to remove minerals may vary widely.&quot; The mineral dust may have negative health effects. Wick humidifiers trap the mineral deposits in the wick; vaporizer types tend to collect minerals on or around the heating element and require regular cleaning with vinegar or citric acid to control buildup.

===Steam Humidifiers===
Steam humidifiers, or warm mist humidifiers, are equipped with a heating element.

A medicated inhalant can also be added to the steam vapor to help reduce cough. Vaporizers may be healthier than cool mist types of humidifiers because steam is less likely to convey mineral impurities or microorganisms from the standing water in the reservoir. However, boiling water requires significantly more energy than other techniques. The heat source in poorly designed humidifiers can overheat, causing the product to melt, leak, and start fires.

==== Tanks ====
The water is usually supplied by manually filling the unit on a periodic basis.

Top fill: A top fill tank has a hole at the top to make it convenient to refill the tank on daily basis.

Bottom fill: Bottom filled humidifiers has removable water tank, often attached with a replaceable demineralization filter. Both the cap and the filter are often universal, which means that they can be switched between many tank cap humidifiers.
Tank cap-based humidifiers are more inconvenient to fill than top fill tanks, because the demineralization filter has to be unscrewed and screwed back on a daily basis. Also, water drops from the tank attachment may get in contact with the hygrometer, which will make it harder to operate properly if they are not operated with caution.

=== Cleaning ===
Ultrasonic wave nebulizers trap the mineral deposits over time, even if filters are used, and require cleaning with vinegar or citric acid to control buildup. It is easy to remove the buildup from the nebulizer in humidifiers with removable base parts. Other models must be screwed. Some models require monthly maintenance, while other models may run for years unmaintained.

==== Activated charcoal filter ====
Some humidifiers have an activated charcoal filter to reduce contaminants.

==== Demineralization filter ====
Humidity with mineral deposits build up on furniture, and static objects like computer monitors, TVs, etc.

Most models with heating elements come with replacement demineralization filters (cartridges, or plastic foam, for the tank, and fabric near the heater in the reservoir) to reduce the amount of minerals entering the system. The cost of these filters is about $10–15 per cartridge or 10-pack for plastic foam, or fabric filters. Cartridges may last for 6 months, and plastic foam/fabric filters may last one month, if the humidifier is frequently used. Cartridges can be used for most humidifiers, but some models have a proprietary format.

Some humidifiers (for example, some cold mist humidifiers) don&#x27;t come with any filters at all.

Clogged filters should be replaced when they cannot deliver water, which is indicated with a &quot;no water&quot; icon/alert signal in modern humidifiers. A manual way to figure out if a filter is clogged is to shake it, if the content of it (even if wet) doesn&#x27;t move around, then it&#x27;s unlikely that sufficient water will pass through.

==== Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) ====
Some humidifiers have an integrated ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) feature.

==== Water ionizer ====
Some humidifiers have an integrated water ionizer.

===Maintenance===
A torx screwdriver is often needed to open consumer electronics.

Humidifiers with a centrifugal fan may become noisy due to build up which cannot effectively be removed with vinegar for example. However, the fan can be replaced, and the model name of the fan and its specifications can be figured out by disassembling the humidifier and detaching it.

== Fixed-installation humidifiers ==
For buildings with a forced-air furnace, a humidifier may be installed into the furnace. They can also protect wooden objects, antiques and other furnishings which may be sensitive to damage from overly dry air. In colder months, they may provide modest energy savings, since as humidity increases, occupants may feel warm at a lower temperature.

Bypass humidifiers are connected between the heated and cold air return ducts, using the pressure difference between these ducts to cause some heated air to make a bypass through the humidifier and return to the furnace.

Any humidifiers should usually be disabled during the summer months if air conditioning is used; air conditioners partially function to reducing indoor humidity, and having a humidifier continue to operate will waste significant amounts of energy.

=== Drums ===
Drum style (bypass) uses a pipe to bring water directly to a reservoir (a pan) attached to the furnace. The water level in the pan is controlled by a float valve, similar to a small toilet tank float. The wick is typically a foam pad mounted on a drum and attached to a small motor; hot air enters the drum at one end and is forced to leave through the sides of the drum. When the hygrostat calls for humidity, the motor is turned on causing the drum to rotate slowly through the pan of water and preventing the foam pad from drying out.
:Advantages include:
:* Low cost
:* Inexpensive maintenance (drum-style pads are cheap and readily available)
:Disadvantages include:
:* Requirement for frequent (approximately monthly) inspections of cleanliness and pad condition
:* Water evaporation even when humidification is not required (due to the pan of water which remains exposed to a high velocity air stream)
:* Mold growth in the pan full of water (this problem is exacerbated by the large quantity of air, inevitably carrying mold spores, passing through the humidifier whether in use or not).

For the latter reason especially, drum-style humidifiers should always be turned off at the water supply during summer (air conditioning) months, and should always be used with high quality furnace air filters (MERV ratings as high as possible to ensure small numbers of mold spores reaching the humidifier pan) when the water supply is turned on.

=== Disc wheels ===
A disc wheel style (bypass) is very similar in design to the drum style humidifiers; this type of furnace humidifier replaces the foam drumming with a number of plastic discs with small grooves on both sides. This allows for a very large evaporative surface area, without requiring a great deal of space. Unlike the drum style humidifiers, the disc wheel does not need regular replacement.

:Advantages include:
:* Very low maintenance (basin of humidifier should be cleaned out periodically, unless an automatic flushing device is installed)
:* No regular replacement of parts necessary
:* Higher output due to large evaporative surface area
:* Can be installed in hard water situations
:* Maintains efficiency throughout lifespans

:Disadvantages include:
:* Higher price
:* Water evaporation even when humidification is not required (due to the pan of water which remains exposed to a high velocity air stream)

=== Bypass flow-through ===
Bypass flow-through style (bypass – also known as &quot;biscuit style&quot; or many other, similar variant names) uses a pipe to bring water directly to an electrically controlled valve at the top of the humidifier. Air passes through an aluminum &quot;biscuit&quot; (often called a pad; the term &quot;biscuit&quot; emphasizes the solid rather than foamy form) which is similar to a piece of extremely coarse steel wool. The &quot;biscuit&quot; has a coating of a matte ceramic, resulting in an extremely large surface area within a small space. When the hygrostat calls for humidity, the valve is opened and causes a spray of water onto the &quot;biscuit&quot;. Hot air is passed through the &quot;biscuit&quot;, causing the water to evaporate from the pad and be carried into the building.
:Advantages include:
:* Reduced maintenance (new &quot;biscuit&quot; is needed only when clogged with dust or mineral deposits, typically once per year)
:* Lack of a pan of potentially stagnant water to serve as a breeding ground for mold as with a drum-style humidifier
:* No incidental humidification caused by a constantly replenished pan of water in a high velocity air stream
:* Reduced requirement for expensive air filters
:* Uses little electricity
:Disadvantages include:
:* A somewhat higher purchase price
:* Manufacturer and model-specific replacement biscuits (versus the relatively generic drum-style pads) may be more expensive and difficult to find
:* For most models, a portion of the water supplied to the unit is not evaporated. This can generate a considerable amount of waste water containing residual minerals, which does require connection to a drain. There is a limited selection of drain-less models that recirculate water, but mineral buildup must then be removed manually on a periodic basis.

=== Spray mist ===
Spray mist type uses a pipe, usually a small plastic one, to bring water directly to an electrically controlled valve (atomizer-this forces the water through a tiny orifice causing it to break up into tiny particles) in the humidifier. Water mist is sprayed directly into the supply air, and the mist is carried into the premises by the air flow.
:Advantages include:
:* Simpler than bypass types to install, requiring a single cut hole for installation, no additional ducting.
:* Uses little electricity.
:* Small, compact unit which fits where other types cannot. (Approximately square.)
:* Because it does not require bypass ducting it does not undermine the pressure separation (and therefore, blower efficiency) of the return and supply ducts.
:* Does not require use of moisture pads (on-going expense).
:* Highly efficient usage of water. Does not generate waste water, and does not require separate connection to a drain.
:* Requires little maintenance. Periodic cleaning of nozzle may be required in hard water environments.
:* Lack of a pan of potentially stagnant water to serve as a breeding ground for mold as with a drum-style humidifier.
:Disadvantages include:
:* Spray nozzle can become clogged in hard water situations, necessitating the use of water filter, periodic cleaning of nozzle, or nozzle replacement.
:* Disperses any minerals in the water into the airstream.

== Invention ==
On July 27, 1962, Raymond Banks applied for a patent for a room humidifier. The patent was granted on November 3, 1964, to the inventor and originally assigned to Walton Labs, Inc.

=== Additional types ===
There are many different types of Plant and Home Humidifiers which can help maintain the humidity level of the home as required.

Additional types include non-bypass flow-through (fan augmented), steam, impeller or centrifugal atomizer, and under duct designs.

== Problems ==
The U.S. EPA provides detailed information about health risks as well as recommended maintenance procedures. If the tap water contains a lot of minerals (also known as &quot;hard water&quot;) then the ultrasonic or impeller humidifiers will produce a &quot;white dust&quot; (calcium is the most common mineral in tap water), which usually settles onto furniture, and is attracted to static electricity generating devices such as CRT monitors. The white dust can be prevented by using distilled water, or a demineralization cartridge in ultrasonic humidifiers. Bottled waters labeled &quot;natural&quot;, &quot;artesian&quot;, or &quot;spring&quot; may still have their original mineral content. The EPA reports that ultrasonic and impeller humidifiers spread the most mineral deposits and microorganisms, while evaporative and steam humidifers can allow the growth of microorganisms but generally disperse less of them into the air.,

In addition, a stuck or malfunctioning water supply valve can deliver large amounts of water, causing extensive water damage if undetected for any period of time. A water alarm, possibly with an automatic water shutoff, can help prevent this malfunction from causing major problems.

From 2006 to 2011, the disinfectant polyhexamethylene guanidine and other toxic materials were used as a cleaning agent for humidifier water tanks in Korea, leading to severe lung disease. Eighty children died of the disorder and nine adults either died or needed lung transplants. In the two years following the banning of cleaning chemicals for humidifier tanks, there were no new cases.

<doc id="1246814" wikidata="Q1147529" url="?curid=1246814" title="Music for the Royal Fireworks">
<text>The Music for the Royal Fireworks (HWV 351) is a suite in D major for wind instruments composed by George Frideric Handel in 1749 under contract of George II of Great Britain for the fireworks in London&#x27;s Green Park on 27 April 1749. The music celebrates the end of the War of the Austrian Succession and the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) in 1748. The work was very popular when first performed and following Handel&#x27;s death.

== Rehearsal and final production ==
During the preparations, Handel and John Montagu, Duke of Montagu, the Master-General of the Ordnance and the officer responsible for the Royal Fireworks, had an argument about adding violins. The duke made clear to Handel that King George had a preference for only martial instruments (winds and percussion), and hoped there would be &quot;no fiddles&quot;. Handel omitted the string instruments against his will. Also, against Handel&#x27;s will, there was a full rehearsal of the music in Vauxhall Gardens and not in Green Park. On 21 April 1749 an audience, claimed to be over twelve thousand people, each paying two shillings and six pence (half a crown) rushed to get there, causing a three-hour traffic jam of carriages on London Bridge, the only vehicular route to the area south of the river.

Six days later, on 27 April, the musicians performed in a specially constructed building designed by Servandoni, a theatre designer, assisted by four Italians. Andrea Casali and Andrea Soldi designed the decorations. The fireworks themselves were devised and controlled by Gaetano Ruggieri and Giuseppe Sarti, both from Bologna. Charles Frederick was the controller, captain Thomas Desaguliers was the chief fire master. The display was not as successful as the music itself: the weather was rainy, causing many misfires, and in the middle of the show the right pavilion caught fire. Also, a woman&#x27;s clothes were set on fire by a stray rocket and other fireworks burned two soldiers and blinded a third. Yet another soldier had his hand blown off during an earlier rehearsal for the 101 cannon which were used during the event.

== Music and instrumentation ==

&quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot; opens with a French overture and includes a bourrée and two minuets. The work is in five movements:
#Overture (Adagio – Allegro – Lentement – Allegro)
#Bourrée
#&quot;La Paix&quot; (Largo alla siciliana)
#&quot;La Réjouissance&quot; (Allegro)
#Menuets I and II

It was scored for a large wind band ensemble consisting of 24 oboes, 12 bassoons and a contrabassoon (originally serpent, later scratched out), nine natural trumpets, nine natural horns, three pairs of kettledrums, and side drums which were given only the direction to play &quot;ad libitum&quot;; no side drum parts were written by Handel. Handel was specific about the numbers of instruments to each written part. In the overture there are assigned three players to each of the three trumpet parts; the 24 oboes are divided 12, 8 and 4; and the 12 bassoons are divided 8 and 4. The side drums were instructed when to play in &quot;La Réjouissance&quot; and the second &quot;Menuet&quot;, but very likely also played in the &quot;Ouverture&quot;.

Handel re-scored the suite for full orchestra for a performance on 27 May in the Foundling Hospital. Handel noted in the score that the violins were to play the oboe parts, the cellos and double basses the bassoon part, and the violas either a lower wind or bass part. The instruments from the original band instrumentation play all the movements in the revised orchestral edition except the &quot;Bourrée&quot; and the first &quot;Menuet&quot;, which are played by the oboes, bassoons, and strings alone.

== Recordings ==
There are many recordings of &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot;. Handel&#x27;s &quot;Water Music&quot;, although it was composed more than thirty years earlier, is often paired with the &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot; as both were written for outdoor performance. 
Older recordings tend to use arrangements of Handel&#x27;s score for the modern orchestra, for example, the arrangements by Hamilton Harty (1923) and Leopold Stokowski. Charles Mackerras´ 1959 recording for Pye Records marked a return to Handel&#x27;s orchestration. 
More recent recordings tend to use more historically informed performance methods appropriate for baroque music and often use authentic instruments.

There are also arrangements for pipe organ, alone or with brass. In 1970, José Feliciano recorded for his &quot;Fireworks&quot; LP part of the work transcribed for classical guitar by himself.

This music was performed under the baton of Andrew Davis for the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II on 1 June 2002, at the Buckingham Palace gardens, complete with fireworks.

<text>Cape Cod Bay is a large bay of the Atlantic Ocean adjacent to the U.S. state of Massachusetts. Measuring below a line drawn from Brant Rock in Marshfield to Race Point in Provincetown, Massachusetts, it is enclosed by Cape Cod to the south and east, and Plymouth County, Massachusetts, to the west. To the north of Cape Cod Bay lie Massachusetts Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. Cape Cod Bay is the southernmost extremity of the Gulf of Maine. Cape Cod Bay is one of the bays adjacent to Massachusetts that give it the name Bay State. The others are Narragansett Bay, Buzzards Bay, and Massachusetts Bay.

==History==
In 1524, Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazzano was the first European to discover Cape Cod Bay, his claim proved by a map of 1529 which clearly outlined Cape Cod. In 1620, the Pilgrims first sheltered in Provincetown Harbor where they signed the Mayflower Compact, the first democratic document signed in the New World.

==Geology==
Most of Cape Cod is composed of glacially derived rocks, sands, and gravels. The last glacial period ended about 12,000 years ago. During the end of the last glaciation, Cape Cod Bay was probably a large freshwater lake with drainages across Cape Cod in places like Bass River and Orleans Harbor. The Provincetown Spit, i.e., the land north of High Head in North Truro, was formed by marine deposits over the last 5,000-8,000 years. These deposits created Provincetown Harbor, a large, bowl-shaped section of Cape Cod Bay. Generally, currents in the Bay move in a counter-clockwise fashion, moving south from Boston, to Plymouth then east and then north to Provincetown. Strong tides flow water into the Bay, cleansing the system with nutrient-rich sea water and maintaining a well-mixed marine environment that helps to maintain a generally healthy and productive system by exchanging roughly 9.3% of the total bay water volume on a regular basis. Surface water stratification and mixing have a distinct seasonal cycle in the Bay. In the winter, the density of bay water is nearly the same from top to bottom, allowing it to mix readily and become nutrient-rich all around. Stratification occurs when the surface water becomes warmer and less thick than the deeper water in the spring, summer, and early fall. Because the water is stratified and rich in nutrients in the spring, biological productivity in the bay is at its peak.

Since 1914, Cape Cod Bay has been connected to Buzzards Bay by the Cape Cod Canal, which divides the upper cape towns of Bourne and Sandwich.

==Ecology==
The sea life of Cape Cod Bay is quite varied and healthy. Fish that call the bay home include Bluefin Tuna, Striped Bass, Bluefish, Flounder, and Atlantic Mackerel. Sea mammals also live in Cape Cod Bay (seals, dolphins and whales). Cape Cod Bay has a diverse range of coastal and marine ecosystems, making it ecologically rich. Beaches, marshes, and offshore water provide critical habitats for plant and animal ecosystems, including commercially valuable fin-fish and shellfish, as well as endangered marine animals and birds. The bay&#x27;s natural resources are used by endangered bird species like the Roseate Tern and the Piping Plover. The North Atlantic right whale, which is severely endangered, feeds in Cape Cod Bay. From April to December, humpback whales travel to Cape Cod Bay and nearby seas to feast on schooling fish.

The Pilgrims shot at a whale unsuccessfully while they were anchored in Provincetown Harbor in 1620.

== Water resources ==
Cape Cod has abundant water resources. These resources include both saltwater and freshwater. Below is a list of the most important resources.

=== Coastal waters ===
The Atlantic Ocean, Nantucket Sound, Vineyard Sound, Buzzards Bay, and Cape Cod Bay form a 559-mile coastline that surrounds the majority fr of the Cape. There are 53 saltwater embayments along this extensive stretch of coastline, each of which is formed by a depression or dip in the coastline that forms a bay abutting the ocean. Estuaries are where rivers and the sea meet. Freshwater, brackish, tidal wetlands, and tidal channels are all found in estuaries. Rivers, streams, and groundwater pour into the ocean&#x27;s estuaries and embayments on Cape Cod.

=== Freshwater bodies ===
The Cape is home to more than a thousand lakes. Nearly 11,000 acres are covered by 996 freshwater ponds and lakes, with individual ponds and lakes ranging in size from less than one acre to 735 acres and 166 &quot;big ponds&quot; of 10 acres or more. Groundwater supplies the Cape&#x27;s ponds and lakes. Groundwater can flow into and out of ponds thanks to the Cape&#x27;s sandy soils. As a result, pond pollution is likely to pollute groundwater and vice versa.

=== Groundwater ===
The Cape&#x27;s lifeline is groundwater. Rain and melting snow swiftly sink into the sandy soils, where it pools to form a massive subterranean groundwater reservoir beneath the majority of the Cape. Groundwater continues to flow into and out of ponds, feeding streams, and flowing towards the coast, finding sea level when it enters our estuaries and embayments, as water seeks the lowest elevation. Drinking water comes entirely from groundwater. This sole-source aquifer, which is protected by local, regional, state, and federal restrictions, provides all of the Cape&#x27;s drinking water.

=== Watersheds ===
Watersheds connect nearly all of the Cape&#x27;s waters, fetching water and releasing it into the ocean. There are 101 watersheds on Cape Cod that discharge into the ocean. 53 of them flow into embayments, which are vulnerable to nitrogen contamination, while the others discharge directly into the ocean. The Cape Cod Commission produced a regional framework for protecting and improving water quality and tracks progress in implementation through the Section 208 Water Quality Management Plan for Cape Cod.

==Fishing==
Cape Cod Bay is a world class fishing destination for many anglers. Popular fishing methods used to fish Cape Cod bay include trolling, live bait fishing, light tackle fishing, and fly fishing. Fisherman typically fish off the coast of the South Shore (Massachusetts) and inner cape for fish such as Blue Fish, Cod, Flounder, Striped Bass, Bonito, Tuna, Mackerel, Pollock, Haddock, and even Sharks.

Fishing season typically takes place between May and October. Although plenty of fisherman prefer to fish from shore rather than a boat, Massachusetts requires a Recreational Saltwater Fishing Permit for anyone 16 years of age or older.

Many coastal towns have fishing piers, and boat charters that provide daily trips into Cape Cod Bay to catch fish. The most popular bait used is sea clams, and live mackerel.

== Threats to Cape Cod Bay ==

=== Pollution and water quality ===
Per the Cape Cod Commission, the bay is experiencing water problems. Although nutrients like nitrogen are an important aspect of aquatic ecosystems, excessive amounts can damage water systems. Cape Cod&#x27;s estuaries are vulnerable to the effects of excess nitrogen due to a number of factors. Nitrogen is poisoning the saltwater barrier that has characterized the peninsula. On Cape Cod, centralized wastewater treatment plants are not extensively employed due to the expense and challenges associated with widely spread housing, as well as huge seasonal fluctuations in population due to summer tourists. Typical backyard sewage systems, which are not aimed at eliminating nitrogen, are responsible for an estimated 80% percent nitrogen dumping on Cape Cod Bay. The circumstances it generates devastate animal habitat and frequently violate water quality requirements, resulting in fish kills and decreased shellfisheries, among other things. The consequences of this pollution must be carefully managed. Another big issue affecting our coastal waters is polluted runoff. Contaminants collected up in precipitation and melting snow are eventually dumped into the bay, resulting in this sort of pollution. Fertilizers and other lawn and garden chemicals, pet waste, salt from streets, and oil and gasoline leaking from autos are all possible contaminants picked up in runoff.

=== Harmful Algal and Cyanobacteria blooms ===
Pollution&#x27;s effects have already been seen in our coastal waters. Excess nutrient input from both point and non-point sources leads to high levels of plant growth, in addition to the direct, harmful impacts of pollution. This process, known as eutrophication, is taking place in Cape Cod Bay to some extent. In the bay, excess nutrients originate mainly from human sources and activities, such as waste systems for example. With the harmful increase of these nutrients comes an increase in algae and bacteria. Phaeocystis blooms are common in Cape Cod Bay during the spring. A bloom of this phytoplankton has far-reaching consequences, including out-competing other beneficial phytoplankton species, impacting zooplankton growth and productivity, and killing off fish species. Alexandrium, another species found in Cape Cod Bay, is responsible for red tides, which bring in harmful toxins, and has been the cause of death for fish, birds, mammals, and sometimes humans as a result. Shellfish that consume toxic phytoplankton become hazardous themselves, posing a risk to humans who consume infected shellfish and wreaking havoc on the shellfishing business. It is important to control HAB&#x27;s and bacterial communities. Algal blooms deplete oxygen in the water, release toxins, and produce a terrible taste and odor. Algae will continue to grow if not treated, disturbing an ecosystem&#x27;s natural equilibrium, and can severely deplete water quality, potentially causing illness in our biological communities and humans.

==Brewster Flats==

The Brewster Flats () are tidal flats on Cape Cod Bay, particularly near the town of Brewster, and are a unique environment. They are the widest expanse of tidal flats in North America, rivaled in the western hemisphere only by a similar expanse in Brazil.

<doc id="1246818" wikidata="Q460072" url="?curid=1246818" title="Flag of the Commonwealth of Nations">
<text>The flag of the Commonwealth of Nations is the official flag used by and representing the Commonwealth of Nations. Its current design dates to 2013, a modification of a design adopted in 1976.

==Description==
The flag consists of the Commonwealth symbol in gold on a blue field. The symbol centres on a globe, representing the global nature of the Commonwealth and the breadth of its membership.

==History==

The flag developed from car pennants produced for the first time at the 1973 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, held in Ottawa, Ontario. The initiative for its design is credited to two Canadians: the first Commonwealth Secretary-General, Arnold Smith; and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. It was officially adopted on 26 March 1976.

===Original design===

The original design featured a globe surrounded by 64 radiating, approximately quadrilateral, sunrays, which form a &#x27;C&#x27; for &#x27;Commonwealth&#x27;. The number of sunrays did not represent the number of member states (there have never been 64 members); instead, the large number represented the many ways in which the Commonwealth cooperates around the world. This flag used Pantone 286.

===2013 redesign===
In 2013, the globe was tilted, and the number of sunrays reduced to 34. The colourings used in the flag were also slightly modified. The standard proportions of the flag are 3:5; however, a 1:2 version appears in countries whose flags use a 1:2 ratio, such as Australia and the UK. This flag used Pantone 280.

==Usage==
The flag of the Commonwealth of Nations is flown at Marlborough House, London, the headquarters of the Commonwealth Secretariat, throughout the year, and for a limited period at other venues where Commonwealth meetings, events, or visits are taking place (for example, Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings). The Canadian federal government does not stipulate that the flag be flown for Commonwealth Day, instead directing that the British Union Jack (officially called the Royal Union Flag) be flown at federal installations which have a second flagpole.

Former Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon encourages the flying of the Commonwealth flag on Commonwealth Day, and the Office of the Secretary-General notes that &quot;it is not the case that the Union Jack – or the flag of any other member country for that matter – is a substitute for the Commonwealth flag which represents the association of 53 members and their peoples.&quot;

Elsewhere, the Commonwealth flag is flown at the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh on Commonwealth Day, from the fourth flagpole in addition to the Union Flag, the Scottish saltire and the European Union flag which all fly daily. Since 2002 the Commonwealth flag has been flown alongside the Union Flag, over the Northern Ireland Assembly&#x27;s home at Parliament Buildings Stormont every Commonwealth Day. It is also flown on Commonwealth Day in the territory of Gibraltar, from the third flagpole alongside the Union Flag and the Flag of Gibraltar, which fly on the roof of No. 6 Convent Place, the office of the Chief Minister of Gibraltar.

On 28 September 2016, the Welsh Conservative AM in the National Assembly for Wales Mohammad Asghar suggested that once the United Kingdom left the European Union, the Welsh Assembly should replace the EU Flag alongside the Union Flag and the Welsh Flag. It has been suggested that the Flag of the Commonwealth be the replacement. On 31 January 2020, Brexit was marked at the Gibraltar border with the lowering of the EU flag and the raising of the Commonwealth flag in its place.

==Commonwealth Games==
A ceremonial flag is used at the Commonwealth Games, the design of which has changed considerably over the years.

<doc id="1246822" wikidata="Q172457" url="?curid=1246822" title="MBTA Commuter Rail">
<text>The MBTA Commuter Rail system serves as the commuter rail arm of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority&#x27;s (MBTA&#x27;s) transportation coverage of Greater Boston in the United States. Trains run over of track on 12 lines to 137 stations. It is operated under contract by Keolis.

In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of , making it the fifth-busiest commuter rail system in the U.S., behind the three New York-area systems and the Chicago-area system. The line&#x27;s characteristic purple-trimmed coaches operate as far south as North Kingstown, Rhode Island, and as far north as Newburyport and as far west as Fitchburg, both in Massachusetts.

Trains originate at two major terminals in Boston – South Station and North Station. The only connection between the two halves of the system is the non-revenue Grand Junction Branch. The North–South Rail Link is a proposed tunnel between North Station and South Station to allow through-running service.

== Service ==
===Lines===
The system consists of twelve lines – four of which have branches – radiating from downtown Boston. Eight &quot;southside&quot; lines terminate at South Station, with four (Framingham/Worcester, Needham, Franklin/Foxboro, and Providence/Stoughton) also running through Back Bay station. Four &quot;northside&quot; lines terminate at North Station. The Kingston Line and Middleborough/Lakeville Line are often grouped together as the Old Colony Lines. The lines vary in length from the Fairmount Line to the Providence/Stoughton Line, with typical lengths in the range. The system has of revenue trackage and covers roughly the eastern third of Massachusetts plus central Rhode Island.

Most lines do not share trackage outside the Boston terminal areas, with several exceptions. The Providence/Stoughton Line and Franklin/Foxboro Line both use the Northeast Corridor between and South Station, with the Needham Line also sharing the tracks between and South Station. The Old Colony Lines and the Greenbush Line all use the Old Colony mainline between South Station and Braintree. The Haverhill Line and Newburyport/Rockport Line share tracks between North Station and near . A small number of Haverhill Line trains use the inner Lowell Line and the Wildcat Branch, while some Franklin/Foxboro Line trains (including all weekend trains) use the Fairmount Line rather than the Northeast Corridor. Several Amtrak intercity routes run on MBTA tracks: the and over the Providence/Stoughton Line, the over the Framingham/Worcester Line, and the over portions of the Lowell and Haverhill lines. Private companies also operate freight service over much of the system (see ).

===Stations===
, there are 137 active stations – 55 northside and 82 southside. One additional station, , is temporarily closed due to reconstruction of an adjacent bridge. Five additional stations (, , , , and ) are indefinitely closed due to service cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six additional stations are under construction as part of the South Coast Rail project; several other stations are planned. South Station, North Station, and Back Bay all have MBTA subway and Amtrak connections; nine other stations have subway connections, and six others have Amtrak connections.

Stations range in size from small platforms like to the sprawling downtown terminals. Most stations outside downtown Boston have one or two side platforms or a single island platform. Standard MBTA platforms are about long – enough for a nine-car train – and a minimum of wide for side platforms and wide for island platforms. 112 active stations are accessible, including all terminals and all stations with rapid transit connections; 25 are not. The MBTA uses -high platforms for accessible level boarding, as is standard in the northeastern United States. Some accessible stations have full-length high platforms for accessible boarding on all cars; others only have &quot;mini-high&quot; platforms about long – which allow for level boarding on two cars – with the rest of the platform length not accessible.

===Operations===
The MBTA Commuter Rail system is operated by Keolis Commuter Services – a subsidiary of French company Keolis – under contract to the MBTA. The MBTA owns all passenger equipment and most stations. Most trackage is also owned by the MBTA. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (parent agency of the MBTA) owns several portions of the Framingham/Worcester Line as well as the Grand Junction Branch, which is used for non-revenue equipment moves between the northside and southside lines. Pan Am Southern owns the section of the Fitchburg Line between and Wachusett, while Amtrak owns the section of the Northeast Corridor (used by the Providence/Stoughton Line) in Rhode Island.

Most lines operate on regular headways, though some have additional service at peak hours. Service levels vary by lines: the Greenbush and Kingston lines have 13 round trips on weekdays, while the Providence/Stoughton Line has 37. Running times vary from 30 minutes on the Fairmount Line to nearly 120 minutes for some Providence/Stoughton Line trips, with 60–75 minutes typical. Most trains stop at all stations on the line; some stations have limited service, and peak-hour express trains operate on several lines. Several lines additionally have some short turn service. The CapeFlyer, a seasonal weekend-only service to Cape Cod, operates using MBTA equipment over the Middleborough/Lakeville Line plus the Cape Main Line (which is not otherwise used by the MBTA). Special express service to Foxboro station is operated during New England Patriots home games and some other events at Gillette Stadium. It runs from South Station via the Franklin/Foxboro Line, and from Providence via the Providence/Stoughton Line. During the winter, one &quot;ski train&quot; round trip of the Fitchburg Line operates with a bicycle car on weekends and Wednesday evenings, with a shuttle bus to Wachusett Mountain.

All MBTA commuter rail service is provided by push-pull trains powered by diesel locomotives (see ). Maximum speed for trains is , though some lines have lower limits. The entire system is signalled and operates with Positive Train Control using the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System. All lines have cab signals for automatic train control. The MBTA is a member of the Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee (NORAC) and uses its operating rules. Most portions of the system operate under NORAC rules 261 and 562, which allow bidirectional train movements on every track (such as an express train passing a local train in the same direction). Most lines are either double track, or single track with passing sidings; portions of the Northeast Corridor have three or four tracks.

==== Freight service ====

Freight service is operated over most of the MBTA Commuter Rail system by several private railroads. CSX Transportation operates freight on most southside lines, of which the outer portion of the Worcester Line has the most freight traffic. Massachusetts Coastal Railroad operates south of Middleborough on the Middleborough/Lakeville Line, as well as on future South Coast Rail trackage. The Fore River Railroad operates between Braintree Yard and East Braintree on the Old Colony mainline and the Greenbush Line. The Providence and Worcester Railroad shares tracks with Providence/Stoughton Line trains between Providence and Wickford Junction; it uses a freight-only track between Providence and Central Falls. No freight operates on the Needham Line, the Northeast Corridor between Readville and Back Bay, the Old Colony mainline between Boston and the Greenbush Line junction in Braintree, the Plymouth/Kingston Line, and most of the Greenbush Line.

CSX also operates on most northside lines; prior to its 2022 purchase by CSX, Pan Am Railways operated over these lines. The Berkshire and Eastern Railroad (formerly Pan Am Southern) operates over the Fitchburg Line west of Ayer. Their combined Freight Main Line between Mechanicville, New York, and Mattawamkeag, Maine, shares tracks with sections of the Fitchburg, Lowell, and Haverhill lines. No freight service is operated over the Newburyport/Rockport Line north of .

Weight limits and loading gauge vary across the system. The full Framingham/Worcester line is rated for car weights of , sections of lines that are part of the Freight Main Line for , and other lines for lower weights. The western portion of the Framingham/Worcester Line and the southern section of the Providence/Stoughton line can accommodate cars up to (AAR Plate H or Plate K). The Fitchburg Line west of Ayer can accommodate cars up to (AAR Plate J), while most of the other northside lines can accommodate up to (AAR Plate F). The inner Fitchburg and Newburyport/Rockport Lines, and the southside except for the outer Framingham/Worcester Line, have height restrictions smaller than Plate F.
=== Fares ===

MBTA Commuter Rail uses a zone fare system, with fares increasing with distance. Zone 1A includes the downtown terminals and other inner core stations up to about from downtown. Ten additional zones, numbered 1 through 10, extend outwards from Boston. Each zone is about 5 miles, with most outer terminals in zones 6 through 8. Only two stations use further zones: in Zone 9, and in Zone 10. Zone 1A fares are identical to MBTA subway fares (though subway passes on CharlieCards are not accepted, except for Fairmount Line stations that have CharlieCard validator machines). , one-way fares within Zone 1A are $2.40, while fares between further zones and Zone 1A range from $6.50 for Zone 1 to $13.25 for Zone 10. Trips that do not enter Zone 1A have less expensive interzone fares; , these range from $2.75 for travel within a single zone to $7.25 for travel between Zone 1 and Zone 10.

Fares can be purchased on the MBTA mTicket app, at automatic vending machines located at major stations, from businesses near some stations, or from conductors on board trains. Discounted passes include monthly passes (with or without free transfer to other MBTA services), &quot;flex passes&quot; valid for five 24-hour periods, and $10 passes offering unlimited travel on a single weekend. As with other MBTA services, discounted fares and passes are available for several groups including disabled passengers, passengers over age 65, and students attending certain schools. Foxboro special event services and the CapeFlyer have separate fares; regular MBTA fares and passes are not valid. Fares are collected by train conductors; while fare evasion is explicitly illegal under state law, it is not criminal. Faregates have also been installed at North Station, with plans for installation at Back Bay and South Station. The second-generation MBTA fare collection system, planned for completion in 2025, will standardize fare media across modes and allow uses of CharlieCards for all commuter rail trips.

== History ==
===Early history===

Eight intercity mainlines radiating from Boston opened between 1834 and 1855: the Boston and Worcester Railroad (B&amp;W) in 1834–35, Boston and Providence Railroad (B&amp;P) in 1834–35, Boston and Lowell Railroad (B&amp;L) in 1835, Eastern Railroad in 1838–1840, Fitchburg Railroad in 1843–45, Boston and Maine Railroad (B&amp;M) in 1845, Old Colony Railroad and Fall River Railroad in 1845–46, and Norfolk County Railroad in 1849–55. Commuter rail service allowing suburban residents to work in Boston began with the B&amp;W in 1834; by the 1860s, commuting was possible on the eight mainlines and a number of branch lines. Mergers prior to the 1880s were primarily acquisitions of branch lines and consolidations with connecting lines: the B&amp;A merged with the Western Railroad in 1874 to become the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&amp;A), the Fall River Railroad and several other lines merged into the Old Colony Railroad, and the Norfolk County Railroad eventually became part of the New York and New England Railroad (NY&amp;NE). The narrow gauge Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad (BRB&amp;L) opened in 1875, competing with the inner portion of the Eastern Railroad. Unlike the other lines, it never built rails into downtown Boston, and instead relied on a ferry connection from East Boston.

The B&amp;M obtained control of the Eastern in 1883, the B&amp;L in 1887, and the Fitchburg in 1900, giving it a near-monopoly on rail service north of Boston. North Union Station was built in 1893 to provide a union station for northside service; it was replaced by North Station in 1928. The Old Colony obtained control of the B&amp;P in 1888; the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad acquired the Old Colony in 1893 to obtain access to Boston. The New Haven also acquired the New England Railroad (successor to the NY&amp;NE) in 1898. South Station opened in 1899 as a union station for the southside lines (New Haven and B&amp;A). The New York Central and Hudson River Railroad – which later became the New York Central) (NYC) – leased the B&amp;A in 1900; this brought all Boston commuter service save the BRB&amp;L under the control of three large multi-state railroads.

The three railroads all planned electrification of some suburban lines in the early 20th century. The New Haven tested electrification on small parts of the Old Colony system, but never followed through on its plans to electrify South Station and the inner section of the ex-B&amp;P. Despite a study to electrify the mainline to plus the Highland branch, the NYC only electrified the short Lower Falls Branch. Quadruple-tracking and electrification of part of the ex-Eastern Railroad was planned by the B&amp;M around 1910 when it was briefly under control of the New Haven, but this fell through when they separated. Service levels on the three major railroads peaked around 1910 and began to decline from streetcar and later auto competition in the 1910s. The independent BRB&amp;L electrified its mainline and single branch line in 1928 and increased service to near-rapid transit levels. Two Old Colony branches were converted to an extension of Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) rapid transit in the 1920s.

Service levels declined more significantly during the 1930s; the 88 stations case resulted in the New Haven closing dozens of suburban stations and several lines in 1938. The BRB&amp;L ceased all operations in 1940. Ridership increased during World War II but decreased soon afterwards, prompting further cuts. The railroads converted from steam to diesel in the 1950s. All three purchased substantial fleets of Budd Rail Diesel Cars, which lowered operating costs – but not enough to save most branch lines. A 1945–47 state report proposed suburban extensions of the rapid transit system, largely using railroad rights-of-way, with the expectation that most commuter rail service would be cut back to the rapid transit terminals or abandoned entirely. Prompted by the report, part of the BRB&amp;L was reactivated as rapid transit in 1952–54 by BERy successor Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), and the Highland branch was converted to a rapid streetcar line in 1958–59.

=== Consolidation under MBTA control ===
The three railroads all made major cuts to suburban service in 1958–1960 as commuters began using new expressways. The B&amp;M became unprofitable in 1958 and moved to shed its money-losing passenger operations. Four branch lines were cut that May, and most stations in the MTA service area were closed; three more branches closed in 1959. The New Haven experimentally increased Old Colony Division service for several years in the 1950s, but new management soon sought to reduce costs. Service to and was cut in 1958; a one-year state subsidy was given for the remaining Old Colony service, which ended in 1959 after the Southeast Expressway opened. The inner portion of the B&amp;A was reduced from four to two tracks in 1959 for construction of the Massachusetts Turnpike, with several inner stations closed; all local stops west of Framingham were closed in 1960. The New Haven filed for bankruptcy for the last time in 1961. Faced with the imminent threat of losing what service remained, public opinion began to support subsidies for commuter rail.

The state Mass Transportation Commission (MTC), formed in 1959 to coordinate transportation and land use, held a series of experiments to determine how fares and service levels affected ridership. This included a trial on the MTA bus network, as well as a $4 million test from January 1963 to March 1964 on New Haven and B&amp;M lines. (The NYC, uninterested in its commuter service, declined to participate.) The MTC found that higher frequency was most important to attract additional ridership; lower fares would attract additional riders, while even higher fares would not result in the services becoming profitable. At the recommendation of the MTC, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was created on August 3, 1964, with a 78-municipality funding and service district. The MBTA was to build rapid transit extensions (as planned in 1947) along some lines, with the others to be subsidized or allowed to be discontinued. Most remaining lines ran to points outside the funding district; those outlying municipalities were expected to reach their own subsidy agreements with the railroads.

On December 14, 1964, the MBTA reached a subsidy agreement with the B&amp;M. The agreement only covered in-district services; on January 5, 1965, the B&amp;M discontinued interstate service except for single commuter round trips from Dover and Concord, New Hampshire; Portsmouth service was cut back to a single round trip. Subsidies began for six lines on January 18; all out-of-district service to , , , , and was discontinued except for three single round trips. Agreements were reached to restore most out-of-district service; after delays due to a lawsuit by the competing Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway, full service returned to , Lowell, Ipswich, and Rockport on June 28. On June 30, 1967, the B&amp;M discontinued the Concord trip; the Dover trip was cut back to Haverhill with local subsidies. In 1969, the B&amp;M averaged 24,000 weekday passengers, with a yearly deficit of $3.2 million (equivalent to million in ). The single daily trip on the Central Mass Branch ended on January 26, 1971.

On July 28, 1965, the MBTA signed an agreement with the New Haven Railroad to purchase of the former Old Colony mainline from Fort Point Channel to South Braintree in order to construct a new rapid transit line along the corridor. The line was expected to be completed within two years. The agreement also provided for the MBTA to subsidize commuter service on the railroad&#x27;s remaining commuter rail lines for $1.2 million (equivalent to million in ) annually. Subsidies for the Needham, Millis, Dedham, and Franklin lines began on April 24, 1966, as the New Haven had Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) permission to discontinue them otherwise. Three out-of-district stations were cut, while Franklin subsidized its station. The Millis and Dedham lines were discontinued on April 21, 1967. The NYC and the Pennsylvania Railroad merged to form Penn Central on February 1, 1968; the New Haven joined at the end of the year. Penn Central declared bankruptcy in 1970. Amtrak took over most intercity passenger service in the US on May 1, 1971, including New York–Boston trains.

The state agreed in December 1971 to purchase of Penn Central rights of way to prevent them being sold off in bankruptcy. The MBTA purchased the lines effective January 27, 1973. They included almost all the lines with passenger service: the Attleboro Line and Stoughton Branch, Franklin Branch, Needham Branch, and the –Framingham portion of the Worcester Main Line. (The inner section of that line was already owned by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority.) The purchase also included several freight-only or abandoned lines, including the Old Colony mainline between Braintree and Brockton. Subsidies began for the Framingham Line in January 1973, for and stations in June 1973, and all Providence/Stoughton Line service on September 28, 1976. The MBTA purchased the B&amp;M Western Route between Somerville and Wilmington Junction in September 1973 for construction of the Haymarket North Extension.

From 1967 to 1973, a series of state appropriations covered 90–100% of outside-of-district subsidy. This was reduced to 50% in January 1974, substantially increasing the cost of these municipalities. This resulted in several cuts as municipalities refused the higher subsidies: Ayer service was cut to on March 1, 1975; the single Newburyport trip ended on April 1, 1976; and the single Haverhill trip ended on April 2, 1976 (North Andover and Andover having previously ended subsidies.) The single round trip to , never subsidized, was cut to Framingham on October 27, 1975. Amtrak began running the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; over that route four days later, restoring rail service to Worcester. State subsidies were increased back to 75% in June 1976 to prevent further cuts.

=== Combined operations ===

Rapid transit extension was slower than expected; by 1971, the only extension in service was the first portion of the Red Line Braintree Branch on the Old Colony mainline. In 1972, as part of a funding shift from highways to transit, Governor Francis Sargent initiated a Commuter Rail Improvement Program. On October 8, 1974, the MBTA began using purple to represent the commuter rail system, as had been done in 1965 with the rapid transit lines. MBTA maps began showing the B&amp;M and Penn Central lines as a single system. Penn Central became Conrail on April 1, 1976; the MBTA purchased most of their commuter rolling stock at that time. After delays due to the B&amp;M bankruptcy, the MBTA purchased the B&amp;M commuter equipment, maintenance facility, and of right of way on December 27, 1976. This included all lines with passenger service, as well as a number of freight-only or abandoned lines. This also marked the start of a five-year contract for the B&amp;M to operate the service, replacing a series of one-year contracts. After acquiring the B&amp;M and Penn Central rolling stock, the MBTA painted it with purple, yellow, silver, and black to create a visual identity.

Federal subsidies allowed MBTA subsidies to Penn Central to remain the same until March 1977, when a large increase was expected. Since it owned the tracks and equipment, the MBTA bid out the operating contract, which was won by the B&amp;M. The B&amp;M began operating the southside lines on March 15, 1977; for the first time, all Boston commuter service was operated by one entity. Although all operation was subsidized by this time, a small number of cuts took place. The lightly used Lexington Branch closed after a snowstorm on January 10, 1977. Declining subsidies from Rhode Island resulted in off-peak service being cut back to in April 1979, with peak service cut on February 20, 1981. Woburn Branch service ended on January 30, 1981, amid state budget cuts.

However, the energy crises of the 1970s and the formation of regional transit authorities prompted some expansions and improvements. $70 million in reconstruction work (equivalent to million in ) on the Franklin Line and several northside lines, partially funded by the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, began in 1977 under the Commuter Rail Improvement Program. Service to Haverhill resumed on December 17, 1979, and to and on January 13, 1980. Federally-funded experimental service to Nashua, Manchester, and Concord, New Hampshire ran from January 28, 1980, to March 1, 1981. Little-used stations continued to be closed until the 1980s, but several infill stations were opened, including in 1981, in 1982, in 1984, and in 1985. The MBTA also began replacing the aging Rail Diesel Cars and other equipment; 18 EMD F40PH diesel locomotives and 60 passenger cars arrived between 1978 and 1980.

Several major disruptions occurred in the mid-1980s. On January 20, 1984, a fire destroyed the wooden approach trestles to the North Station drawbridges. The four northside lines used temporary terminals with rapid transit connections while the trestles were rebuilt. Another bridge fire between Beverly and Salem on November 16, 1984, isolated part of the Ipswich/Rockport Line from the rest of the system. Service to North Station resumed on April 20, 1985; service to Ipswich and Rockport resumed on December 1, 1985.

Guilford Transportation Industries purchased the B&amp;M in 1983. This did not initially affect commuter rail operations. Guilford&#x27;s attempts to regain profitability, which included reducing employee headcount and pay, soon soured labor relations. This resulted in two strikes by Guilford employees; the first shut down the commuter rail system from March 21 to May 12, 1986. Local media was critical of Guilford during the strike; the company did not bid for a renewal of the commuter rail operating contract, which expired at the end of 1986. Amtrak won the contract for commuter rail operations and took over the system on January 1, 1987. Gardner service was cut back to Fitchburg at that time due to a dispute between Amtrak, Guilford, and the MBTA.

=== Expansions ===
The late 1980s saw the beginning of substantial expansion of the system. The Southwest Corridor project was completed in 1987 with a new below-ground alignment for commuter rail, Amtrak, and Orange Line trains. Back Bay and stations were completely rebuilt as transfer stations, and opened to serve the growing Longwood Medical Area. The Needham Line, closed since 1979 for construction, was reopened. The Attleboro and Franklin lines had been diverted over the previously freight-only Dorchester Branch during construction; after they returned to the Southwest Corridor, a shuttle service was retained as the Fairmount Line. Peak-hour service to Providence resumed in 1988 (with off-peak and weekend service later added); was added in 1990 as a park-and-ride station to replace . The Franklin Line was extended to in 1988; infill stations in that era included in 1988 to serve Boston Red Sox games at Fenway Park, and in 1990.

Massachusetts had state accessibility laws since 1977 – prior to 1990 federal legislation. At times, the MBTA clashed with state regulators: several stations including West Natick and Chelsea were built without accessible platforms despite state rules; the latter resulted in fines from the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board (MAAB). The opening of South Attleboro was delayed by the MAAB because of the MBTA&#x27;s refusal to build full-length high-level platforms. However, the MBTA did slowly increase accessibility of the system. Most Ipswich/Rockport line stations were made accessible during the 1984–85 closure, and renovations followed at other stations. South Station was made accessible in the late 1980s, Back Bay during the Southwest Corridor project, and North Station in the early 1990s, providing accessibility at the main downtown Boston stations. By 1992, 44 commuter rail stations were accessible.

In 1991, the state agreed to build a set of transit projects as part of the settlement of a lawsuit by the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) over auto emissions from the Central Artery/Tunnel Project (Big Dig). Among these project were extensions of the Framingham Line to Worcester and the Ipswich/Rockport Line to Newburyport, restoration of the Old Colony Lines, and addition of 20,000 park and ride spaces outside the urban core. Peak-hour service to Worcester began in 1994, followed by off-peak and weekend service; four intermediate stations were added in 2000 and 2002. Service on the Old Colony Lines (Middleborough/Lakeville Line and Kingston/Plymouth Line) began in 1997. and opened in 1998. The MBTA Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, which replaced the ex-B&amp;M Boston Engine Terminal, was completed in 1998.

Two tenders were submitted in 2003, one from GTI and another from the newly formed Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad Company (MBCR), a partnership between Connex (later Veolia), Bombardier Transportation and Alternate Concepts, Inc. MBCR won the contract, and took over the MBTA Commuter Rail operation from Amtrak in July 2003. The MBCR contract originally expired in July 2008 but had an additional five-year option; it was later extended three years to July 2011 and then another two to July 2013. After concerns about on-time performance, the 2011 extension increased the fine for late trains from $100 to $300.

The MBTA considered running the service directly rather than contracting it out, but this &quot;public option&quot; was rejected in 2012. In August 2012, MBCR and Keolis were the two bidders for the contract. On January 8, 2014, the MBTA awarded Keolis the contract for $2.68 billion over eight years, with the possibility of two two-year extensions that could bring the total price to $4.3 billion. Keolis took over the operations on July 1, 2014. Keolis lost $29.3 million in its first year of operation. In June 2020, the MBTA extended the contract through at least 2025.

Free Wi-Fi internet service was piloted in January 2008 on the Worcester Line, where 45 coaches were fitted with routers which connected to cellular data networks. This was the first Wi-Fi available on a commuter rail service in the United States. The program was considered successful; in December 2008, the MBTA announced that Wi-Fi would be available on all trains by mid-2009. In July 2014, the MBTA announced that a private company would be building a new network by 2016 to replace the 2008-built network. The MBTA would not pay for the new network; the company would have a two-tier model with a fee for higher bandwidth. The MBTA canceled the plan in August 2017 due to local opposition to the erection of 320 monopoles, each tall, as well as the need to focus on more critical projects like the Green Line Extension. By that time, the 2008-built system was largely unusable to the decommissioning of 3G networks. Mobile ticketing was introduced on the northside lines on November 12, 2012, and on the southside lines on November 28.

Positive Train Control was implemented on the entire system per a federal mandate, which required installation by the end of 2018 with the possibility of a two-year extension. Construction began in 2017. The final segment of the system to have Positive Train Control activated was the inner Worcester Line on August 15, 2020. Most of the southside lines already had cab signals for automatic train control (ATC) prior to PTC implementation, but the northside lines did not. Cab signals on the southside were completed in 2020. Temporary bus replacements for several lines took place between 2017 and 2022 during PTC and ATC construction and testing. PTC implementation, including cab signals on the northside, was completed in January 2025.

*The Greenbush Line opened in 2007.
*The Riverside-Framingham section was sold to the MBTA in 1976 as part of their larger acquisition of PC commuter assets, but the section past Framingham remained in Conrail control. In September 2009, Conrail successor CSX Transportation and the Commonwealth finalized a agreement to purchase CSX&#x27;s Framingham to Worcester tracks, as well as the Grand Junction Railroad plus lines which will be part of the South Coast Rail project, to improve service on the Framingham/Worcester Line. After several years of construction and negotiations, ownership of the line was transferred to the commonwealth on October 4, 2012, with increased service on the outer section of the line beginning several weeks later.
*As Big Dig mitigation, MBTA rebuilt existing stations and added 4 new stations along the Fairmount Line. The first of these, Talbot Avenue, opened on November 12, 2012, followed by Newmarket and Four Corners/Geneva on July 1, 2013. Blue Hill Avenue station was opened on February 25, 2019, after many delays.
*Service along the Providence/Stoughton Line was extended further south to T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island in December 2010 and to Wickford Junction in North Kingston in April 2012. This represents the first commuter service in Rhode Island south of Providence since 1981.
*In 2013, the CapeFLYER service began running from South Station to Hyannis on summer weekends – the first direct service from Boston to Cape Cod since 1959. Though officially a Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority service, the CapeFLYER uses MBTA equipment. 
*A 4-mile extension of the Fitchburg Line to Wachusett station opened on September 30, 2016.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====
Weekday service was substantially cut on March 17, 2020, due to reduced ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 22, service was increased to 85% of normal weekday levels. Changes effective November 2 reduced peak service and increased off-peak service, providing more consistent midday headways on some lines; Foxboro pilot service was suspended.

In November 2020, as part of service cuts during the pandemic, the MBTA proposed to close six low-ridership stations. On December 14, the MBTA Board voted to enact a more limited set of cuts, including indefinitely closing five stations. That day, temporary reduced schedules were again put into place, with four of the five stations (, , , and ) not served.

On January 23, 2021, reduced schedules based on the December 14 vote went into place, with no weekend service on seven lines. Service changes on April 5, 2021, increased midday service on most lines as part of a transition to a regional rail model. Weekend service on the seven lines resumed on July 3, 2021. Ridership dropped substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, with daily boardings just 12,800 during the first quarter of 2021. Ridership rose to 47,100 average weekday boardings in the first quarter of 2022, and 85,000 (69% of 2018 ridership) in October 2022. Limited Foxboro service resumed in May 2022; full pilot service began that September. The service was made permanent effective October 2, 2023.

In April 2024, the MBTA extended the Keolis contract by one year to June 30, 2027, at which time a successor contract will take effect. Silver Hill station reopened on November 18, 2024. In December 2024, the MBTA indicated that the next contract may be split into separate contracts for train maintenance, infrastructure maintenance, operations, and dispatching.

== Rolling stock ==

All MBTA commuter rail service is provided by push-pull trains powered by diesel locomotives with a cab car on the opposite end. The locomotive is usually on the end facing away from Boston so that diesel exhaust does not enter the passenger concourses at North Station and South Station. Trains typically have four to eight coaches (with six the most common) and seat between 400 and 1,400 passengers. Approximately 62 trainsets are needed for weekday service.

The primary heavy maintenance facility is the MBTA Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, located in the Inner Belt District in Somerville. It is also used for midday and overnight storage of trains on the northside lines. Southampton Street Yard and the Readville Interim Layover facility are used for light maintenance and layover service. Various other layover facilities are used for midday and overnight storage; most are located near the outer ends of the lines. Some maintenance and storage of MBTA equipment is contracted out to the Seaview Transportation Company in North Kingstown, Rhode Island.

Several additional yards are under construction or planned. Two layovers are under construction for South Coast Rail, with service planned for mid-2025, and the Haverhill Line layover at is proposed for relocation later in the 2020s. A new midday layover yard at the former Beacon Park Yard is planned to be constructed by 2032 as part of the realignment of I-90. A large midday and overnight layover yard, which would support expanded service including regional rail and electrification, is planned at Widett Circle near South Station. The MBTA also plans to construct a southside maintenance and layover facility at in 2023–2028, replacing the existing layover yard there, as the Grand Junction Branch will be closed for several years during the I-90 project.

=== Locomotive fleet ===
, the MBTA owned 109 locomotives. Of these, 87 were in active passenger service. Eleven were undergoing rebuild, six awaiting repairs, and five retired or out of service. All passenger locomotives are equipped with head end power. Rebuilding of 37 F40PH-2C and F40PHM-2C locomotives to F40PH-3C class by MotivePower (MPI) began in 2017; other older locomotives are also being rebuilt by MPI or in-house.

=== Coach fleet ===
, the MBTA owned 552 coaches. Of these, 448 were in active service, three being repaired or overhauled, and 101 stored pending disposition or reuse. Coaches whose designations start with BTC (Blind Trailer Coach) are conventional coaches, while those starting with CTC (Control Trailer Coach) are cab cars. Coaches acquired before 1990 were single-level cars with 88 to 127 seats; those since are bilevel cars with 173 to 185 seats. Some coaches are equipped with electronic doors for use on the Old Colony Lines and Greenbush Line, which have full-length high-level platforms at all stops. All BTC-3, CTC-3, BTC-4C, and BTC-4D coaches have restrooms. During winter months, a Ski Train serving Wachusett Mountain runs on the Fitchburg Line, using a coach car which is equipped for carrying bicycles or skis. Three converted coaches – a bike car and two cafe cars – are reserved for the CapeFLYER.

The agency issued a $279 million contract (total project cost of $345 million) for 80 additional Rotem bilevel coaches in September 2019, with delivery expected from September 2022 to June 2024. The contract was later modified to 83 coaches, of which 43 are cab cars. The first four of the 83 bilevel cars arrived in June 2022 and entered service in 2023. In May 2024, the MBTA exercised an option order for 41 additional trailer coaches at a cost of $203 million, with deliveries to begin in mid-2026. An $165 million option for 39 additional coaches (29 trailers and 10 cab cars), which would allow the retirement of all remaining single-level equipment, was exercised in November 2024 with deliveries to begin in 2027.

=== Retired equipment ===

As the MBTA assumed control of the commuter rail during the 1970s, it inherited various equipment from predecessor railroads. The 1976 purchase of B&amp;M and Penn Central equipment included 94 Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs) – 86 from the B&amp;M and eight from Penn Central – plus 116 Penn Central coaches and 25 Penn Central E8 and GP9 diesel locomotives. Although the MBTA purchased some new equipment in 1978–1980, large locomotive and coach fleets were not purchased until the late 1980s, so the first decade of combined operations used a variety of secondhand equipment in addition to that acquired in 1976:
*Four ALCO PA locomotives leased from the Delaware and Hudson Railway in 1978
*48 coaches leased from GO Transit in 1978–1980. 51 coaches (some of which were in the previous group) were leased in 1984–85.
*19 EMD GP7 locomotives leased from the B&amp;M in 1978–1982
*24 RDCs acquired or leased from MARC, SEPTA, and New Jersey Transit between 1983 and 1987
*11 EMD GP9 locomotives acquired from the Burlington Northern Railroad and SEMTA in 1983–1986
*One EMD SW9 locomotive acquired from the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad in 1984
Most of the secondhand and inherited equipment was retired between 1979 and 1989. 33 ex-B&amp;M RDCs were converted to locomotive-hauled coaches (designated BTC-2 and CTC-2) in 1980 and 1982; they were retired by 1989. This left all MBTA service operated by locomotives and coaches purchased new by the MBTA. At several points since, the MBTA or its contract operator has temporarily leased locomotives when needed. Some passenger equipment acquired new by the MBTA has been retired:
*18 EMD F40PH locomotives (1000–1017), built 1978–1980 and last ran in 2015
*19 EMD FP10 locomotives (1100–1114 and 1150–1153), rebuilt 1979 from Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad locomotives and last ran in 1991

== Expansion projects ==
=== Regional Rail Modernization Program ===

The MBTA plans to convert the system from diesel-powered commuter rail – which is primarily designed for Boston-centric trips at peak hours – to an electric regional rail system with frequent all-day service. A previous attempt at regional rail was made in 2012–2015 with a procurement for diesel multiple units for a new hybrid rail service labeled the Indigo Line, which proposed increased service on the Fairmount Line, new Track 61 service, and several other suburban lines within the Greater Boston periphery. The DMU procurement as well as the Indigo Line proposal was canceled in 2015.

Between 2018 and 2019, the MBTA conducted an internal study of regional rail alternatives known as Rail Vision. The study assessed domestic and international peer rail systems that the MBTA could model electric service from, as well as outlined service alternatives on a line-by-line basis. The first phase of this transformation focused on electrifying the Providence Line, the Fairmount Line, and the Rockport Line through Chelsea, Revere, and Lynn. Later in 2019, the MBTA contracted Network Rail Consulting, the international consulting arm of Network Rail, to assist with regional rail planning.

Despite approval by the FMCB, planning for regional rail largely stagnated into the early 2020s, with only noncommittal plans for several electrification pilots. By mid-2022, lawmakers and environmental advocacy groups had criticized recent MBTA proposals for not adhering to previously set rail initiatives. Several preliminary projects, including planning for a new layover facility – but not actual electrification – were scheduled for fiscal years 2023 to 2027. Early-action regional rail projects including designs for power systems, substations, signal upgrades, and track improvements along with the procurement of 25 EMUs are planned for fiscal years 2025 to 2029. In June 2022, the MBTA indicated plans to purchase battery electric multiple units, with catenary for charging on part of the network. This was intended to reduce the amount of catenary installation required, avoid reconstructions of overhead bridges, and avoid poor existing power grids on some branch lines. The assessment called for electric service on the Providence/Stoughton Line and Fairmount Line by 2028–29, followed by the Newburyport/Rockport Line in 2031; all lines would be electrified by 2050.

In December 2023, Keolis solicited a proposal to procure BEMUs and implement 20-minute headways on the Fairmount Line by 2027 as leverage for contract renewal; the MBTA issued a notice of due diligence. The MBTA board approved the $54 million Fairmount Line proposal from Keolis in July 2024, with the new equipment to enter service in early 2028. Keolis will construct a light maintenance facility for BEMUs as part of the contract. By the mid-2020s, the MBTA had adapted short-term plans for regional rail to instead optimize diesel-hauled operations for increased services on select corridors, with electrification being implemented later after 2030 (with the exception of the Fairmount Line). Initial steps were taken previously in fall 2020 when some peak service was moved to midday, and in April 2021 when 9 of the 15 lines were moved to clock-face scheduling.
=== North–South Rail Link ===
No direct connection exists between the two downtown commuter rail terminals; passengers must use the MBTA subway or other modes to transfer between the two halves of the system. (For non-revenue transfers of equipment, the MBTA and Amtrak use the Grand Junction Branch.) The proposed North–South Rail Link would add a new rail tunnel under downtown Boston to allow through-running service, with new underground stations at South Station, North Station, and possibly a new Central Station. A feasibility study was conducted in 2018.

=== South Coast Rail ===

The South Coast Rail project is under construction to extend service to the South Coast cities of Taunton, Fall River, and New Bedford, which were last served by commuter service in 1958. A full planning process was held from 1990 until its suspension in 2002. Planning restarted in 2007, with environmental documentation completed in August 2013. Plans were modified into two phases in 2017 due to an increase in costs. Phase I construction to run diesel service as an extension of the Middleborough/Lakeville Line via the Middleboro Secondary took place from 2020 to 2024. , Phase 1 service is expected to begin on March 24, 2025. Phase II, proposed for completion by 2030, would extend the Stoughton Branch of the Providence/Stoughton Line over a reactivated line with electric service.

=== Other extensions ===
Two extensions of existing lines have been studied in the 2020s:
*Extension of the Middleborough/Lakeville Line to Buzzards Bay or Sagamore (both in Bourne) to serve Cape Cod was studied in 1997, and extension to Buzzards Bay was again studied in 2007. The extension was again proposed after the 2013 introduction of the CapeFLYER. The town of Bourne voted in 2015 to join the MBTA district. MassDOT began planning a possible commuter rail trial service in October 2015. The proposed service, which was to have shuttle trains between Bourne and operated by Massachusetts Coastal Railroad, was rejected by the MBTA Fiscal Management and Control Board in April 2016. Middleborough station, which will replace Middleborough/Lakeville in 2023 when South Coast Rail service begins, was built with space for a potential future platform for shuttle trains. A 2021 study analyzed two alternatives for service to Buzzards Bay or Bourne station. Middleborough–Buzzards Bay shuttle service with 7 daily round trips was expected to have 1,710 total daily boardings, while Middleborough–Bourne service with 10 daily round trips (including two off-peak Boston–Bourne round trips) was expected to have 2,540 total daily boardings.
*Extension of the Lowell Line to Manchester and Nashua, New Hampshire has been proposed since the 1980–81 pilot service. The extension has been a politically contentious issue at the state level in New Hampshire, with Democratic politicians supporting the service and Republican politicians opposing it. A 2014 alternatives analysis recommended several possible services, including commuter rail to Nashua or Manchester or intercity rail to Concord, for further evaluation. Engineering and design work for commuter service to Manchester began in late 2020, and was completed in February 2023. In August 2023, New Hampshire Governor candidate Joyce Craig made a public statement endorsing the project as part of her campaign.

Several other extensions of existing lines and restoration of service to disused lines have been studied in the past:

*Extension of the Providence/Stoughton Line to Westerly, Rhode Island (studied in 2001 and 2017)
*Extension of the Franklin Line to Milford (studied in 1997) or Woonsocket, Rhode Island (studied in 2007)
*Restoration of service on the Millis Branch to (studied in 1998)
*Restoration of service on the Milford Branch to Milford (studied in 1990 and 1997)
*Restoration of service on the Fitchburg Secondary to Marlborough (studied in 1990) or Northborough/I-290 (studied in 2002)
*Rerouting of some Framingham/Worcester Line service to North Station via the Grand Junction Branch (studied in 2012)
*Restoration of service on the Central Mass Branch to Berlin/I-495 (studied in 1996)
*Restoration of service on the Lexington Branch to (studied in 1985)
*Extension of the Fitchburg Line to (studied in 2005)
*Extension of the Haverhill Line to Plaistow, New Hampshire (studied in 2015)
*Extension of the Newburyport/Rockport Line to Portsmouth, New Hampshire (studied in 1988 and 1999)
*Restoration of service on the Peabody Branch between and Danvers (studied in 2004)
*Restoration of service on the Manchester and Lawrence Branch between Lawrence, Massachusetts and Manchester, New Hampshire (studied in 2009)
=== Infill stations ===

Several infill stations on existing lines are proposed:
*West Station is a proposed Framingham/Worcester Line station to serve the Beacon Park Yard redevelopment.
*South Salem station is a proposed Newburyport/Rockport Line station near Salem State University.

=== Station renovations ===
Several station renovations for accessibility, expanded service, and/or repairs are under construction or planned:
*Natick Center station is being rebuilt for accessibility, with completion expected in May 2025.
*Winchester Center station is being rebuilt for accessibility. The station was temporarily closed in January 2021 due to structural deterioration; the rebuilt station partially opened on October 1, 2024, with the remaining portion to open in July 2025.
*A new island platform at Worcester Union Station was opened on July 1, 2024, with the project expected to be fully complete in August 2025.
*Design work for reconstruction of South Attleboro station for accessibility was completed in April 2022, though construction work has not been funded. The station was temporarily closed on February 26, 2021, due to structural deterioration; limited service resumed on May 20, 2024.
*Reconstruction of for accessibility began in 2024 and is expected to be complete in early 2025.
*Reconstruction of is planned. The station was temporarily closed in October 2022 due to structural deterioration; interim platforms opened in December 2023.
*Reconstruction of , , and for accessibility and increased capacity are planned. In November 2024, the state committed to the reconstruction of Newtonville station.
*In 2024, the MBTA tested a temporary freestanding accessible platform design at Beverly Depot. These platforms do not require alterations to the existing platforms, thus skirting federal rules requiring full accessibility renovations when stations are modified, and were intended to provide interim accessibility at lower cost pending full reconstruction. Construction of interim platforms at , , , and began in 2024; all are expected to be complete in February 2025. The first, Wellesley Square, opened on February 17, 2025. Eight more stations are planned to receive the platforms; the second group will be , , , , and .

<text>KNBC (channel 4) is a television station in Los Angeles, California, United States, serving as the West Coast flagship station of the NBC network. It is owned and operated by the network&#x27;s NBC Owned Television Stations division alongside Corona-licensed Telemundo outlet KVEA (channel 52). The two stations share studios at the Brokaw News Center in the northwest corner of the Universal Studios Hollywood lot off Lankershim Boulevard in Universal City; KNBC&#x27;s transmitter is located on Mount Wilson.

==History==
Channel 4 first went on the air as KNBH (standing for &quot;NBC Hollywood&quot;) on January 16, 1949. It was the second-to-last VHF station in Los Angeles to debut, and the last of NBC&#x27;s five original owned-and-operated stations to sign on. Unlike the other four, KNBH was the only NBC-owned television station that did not benefit from having a sister radio station. Though the NBC Radio Network had long been affiliated with KFI in Los Angeles, that relationship did not extend into television when KFI-TV (channel 9, now KCAL-TV) signed on in August 1948. When KNBH signed on, it marked the debut of NBC programs on the West Coast. Channel 4 originally broadcast from the NBC Radio City Studios on Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in Hollywood.

The station changed its callsign to KRCA (for NBC&#x27;s then-parent company, the Radio Corporation of America) on October 18, 1954. The call letters were changed again on November 11, 1962, when NBC moved the KNBC identity from its San Francisco radio station (which became KNBR) and applied it to channel 4 in Los Angeles. That call letter change coincided with the station&#x27;s physical relocation from NBC Radio City to the network&#x27;s color broadcast studio facility in suburban Burbank. NBC Color City, as it was then known, had been in operation since March 1955, and was at least four to five times larger than Radio City, and could easily accommodate KNBC&#x27;s locally produced studio programming. NBC Radio&#x27;s West Coast operations eventually followed channel 4 to Burbank not too long after.

===KNBC===
The station officially modified its callsign to KNBC-TV in August 1986, shortly after NBC and RCA were purchased by General Electric; the -TV suffix was dropped effective September 6, 1995.

On October 11, 2007, NBCUniversal announced that it would put its Burbank studios up for sale and construct a new, all-digital facility near the Universal Studios Hollywood backlot in Universal City, to merge all of NBCUniversal&#x27;s West Coast operations (including KNBC, KVEA and NBC News&#x27; Los Angeles bureau) into one area. The studio opened on February 1, 2014. Shortly thereafter, NBCUniversal named the new broadcast center in honor of former KNBC and NBC News anchor/reporter Tom Brokaw, christened the Brokaw News Center.

In fall 2007 with the rollout of digital broadcasting, the station began airing a 24/7 newschannel News Raw on the .2 subchannel.

KNBC ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 36, using virtual channel 4. Since the station qualified for the nightlight clause in the DTV Delay Act, it was required to keep its analog signal on for two weeks from June 12 to 26, 2009 to inform viewers of the digital television transition, consisting of a loop of digital transition public service announcements, while the digital channel was used for normal programming.

On January 1, 2014, Universal Sports transitioned into a cable- and satellite-exclusive service, causing its affiliates (such as KNBC) to replace the network and remove the channel from their digital signals entirely.

===NBC California Nonstop===
KNBC operated NBC California Nonstop, a collaboration between KNBC and two other NBC-owned stations in California (KNSD in San Diego and KNTV in San Jose) which launched on May 3, 2011, and replaced programming from NBC Plus on the second digital subchannels of all three stations. In the case of KNBC, it was the second news-oriented digital channel operated by the station, as digital channel 4.2 featured a rolling news format under the name NewsRaw (which moved from digital channel 4.4 upon Weather Plus&#x27; shutdown on December 1, 2008), before the launch of California Nonstop. Each station produced a local newscast at 7 p.m. that was tailored to their respective market. For the Los Angeles feed of the channel, Colleen Williams anchored the hour-long &quot;Nonstop News LA&quot;. NBC California Nonstop ended on December 20, 2012, when Cozi TV was launched.

==Programming==
===Sports programming===
The station has had a long history of carrying Los Angeles sports teams via NBC Sports. The station aired select Dodgers games from their arrival in Los Angeles in 1958 until 1989 (and games featuring the California Angels from their establishment in 1961 to 1989) via NBC&#x27;s Major League Baseball broadcast contract; this included the Dodgers&#x27; World Series victories in 1959, 1963, 1965 and 1988. Channel 4 was the station of record for the NFL&#x27;s Raiders during their tenure in Los Angeles from 1982 to 1994, and also aired any Lakers and Clippers games that were part of the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot;. This included the Lakers championships in 2000, 2001 and 2002 (game 4 of the 2002 series was the last NBA game aired on NBC) and the team&#x27;s appearance in 1991. Additionally, it served as the home station for the Rose Bowl Game in Pasadena from its first telecast in 1952 until 1988.

KNBC also provided local coverage of Super Bowl VII, which was hosted at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (and was the first Super Bowl televised in the host city), as well as Super Bowls XI, XVII, and XXVII, which were hosted at the Rose Bowl. Furthermore, the station provided local coverage of Super Bowl LVI, which was held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood and won by the Rams. The first Super Bowl, which was also held at the Coliseum and broadcast on both NBC and CBS, did not air on KNBC or KNXT (channel 2, now KCBS-TV), due to the NFL&#x27;s blackout policy of the time, which did not allow home telecasts of games regardless of whether they were sold out, including playoffs and the league championship game, and that policy extended to the host cities for the first six Super Bowls—Los Angeles, Miami (II, III, V), and New Orleans (IV and VI). The American Football League, before its merger with the NFL starting with the 1970 season, also had a similar home blackout policy to the NFL&#x27;s, and starting with the 1973 season, home games were allowed to be televised in the local market, so long as the game sold out 72 hours in advance (the blackout rules were lifted completely in 2015). This allowed KNBC to televise any Los Angeles Rams inter-conference home games via NBC&#x27;s AFC Sunday afternoon package if the game was sold out in advance; the first such game was the final home game of the 1973 season, as the Rams hosted the Cleveland Browns at the Coliseum on December 16.

Until 2021, the station aired select games involving the Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks via NBC&#x27;s broadcast contract with the NHL, including Stanley Cup Finals victories in 2007 for the Ducks, and 2012 and 2014 for the Kings. Today, KNBC carries any Rams and/or Chargers games that are chosen for &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; (the station previously aired any Rams home inter-conference games from 1973 to 1994 when NBC had the AFC broadcast package), including the Rams&#x27; victory in Super Bowl LVI (notably as the second NFL team to play in and win a Super Bowl at its home stadium, although the Rams were designated as the visiting team). It will also be the home station when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics and will share the Universal Studios lot with international broadcasters covering the Games.

Since 2024, the station aired select college football games involving the UCLA Bruins and USC Trojans as part of &quot;Big Ten Saturday Night&quot;.

===News operation===

As of 2022, KNBC broadcasts 44 hours, 25 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 35 minutes each weekday, three hours on Saturdays, and hours on Sundays). The station&#x27;s newscasts have historically more of a &quot;serious&quot; tone covering issues (such as politics, government, education, and the economy) than other Los Angeles area newscasts. In 2010, the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California found KNBC to have the least coverage of crime and the second-highest coverage of local government and sports and weather, compared to other Los Angeles stations. As part of a 2012 investment by parent company Comcast, KNBC&#x27;s newscasts added 18 employees and produced more enterprise reporting. The station runs a special hour-long newscast on Sunday nights during the NFL season where &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; telecasts preempt the 6 p.m. newscast. On election nights, KNBC runs a special extended edition of its 11 p.m. newscast to show early election results.
In April 1968. channel 4 revamped its news programs into the &quot;KNBC News Service&quot; (stylized on the air as &quot;KNBC Newservice&quot;) which, when combined with the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;, comprised the first 2½ hour-long block of early-evening local and national news on a major-market television station in the United States. The &quot;KNBC Newservice&quot; lasted until March 1976, when the newscasts adopted the &quot;NewsCenter 4&quot; title. NBC made similar changes to newscasts in other markets around the same time, and channel 4 shared the &quot;NewsCenter&quot; branding with sister stations WNBC-TV in New York City, WRC-TV in Washington, D.C., and WMAQ-TV in Chicago. KNBC&#x27;s newscasts were the last to drop the &quot;NewsCenter&quot; moniker, rebranding to &quot;News 4 LA&quot; in July 1982 as the station also launched a new hour-long newscast at 4 pm. The branding changed once more to &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; in August 1985. While KNBC became known on-air as &quot;NBC 4&quot; in 1995, the &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; branding was so well established in Southern California that the title was retained for 26 years until 2011, when it became &quot;NBC 4 News&quot;.

For most of the last 30 years, KNBC has waged a spirited battle with KABC-TV for the top-rated local newscast in Southern California, becoming a three-way race with KCBS-TV&#x27;s ratings resurgence in 2006. Throughout the late 1980s and into the early 2000s, KNBC&#x27;s newscasts were the most-watched in the region, beating out every other station viewership-wise, which coincided with NBC&#x27;s overall ratings at the time. Channel 4&#x27;s 11 p.m. newscast currently sits in the first place (adults 25–54) and has been for nine months straight; most of the station&#x27;s other newscasts, including its once-popular morning news program, &quot;Today in L.A.&quot;, the area&#x27;s first local morning newscast (which debuted in 1986), now is battling for second place.

For many years, KNBC produced a late afternoon newscast at 4 pm, which was dropped in 2002, in favor of &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; (that program moved to KCBS-TV in 2004, and was replaced by &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; through the end of the show&#x27;s run in 2022). The station also had an hour-long 11 a.m. newscast, which later was trimmed to a half-hour before ultimately being canceled at the start of the 2010 Winter Olympics. The station revived its midday newscast as a half-hour program at noon in early 2012, which expanded to one hour that September. KNBC became the fifth station in the Los Angeles market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition on July 14, 2008 (Spanish-language sister station KVEA and former sister KWHY-TV also converted their newscasts to HD at the same time). On December 6, 2011, KNBC entered into a partnership with public radio station KPCC as part of a larger effort by NBCUniversal to partner with non-profit news organizations following its acquisition by Comcast.

In 2006, KNBC launched a local news channel on digital channel 4.4 called &quot;News Raw&quot;, that provided hourly news updates, additional information on breaking news stories, and previewed news stories scheduled to air on the main channel&#x27;s newscasts. After Universal Sports was launched in 2008, &quot;News Raw&quot; became a part-time channel, and was later dropped when KNBC expanded Universal Sports programming on the former subchannel to 24 hours a day. Mekahlo Medina, the host of &quot;News Raw&quot;, has received national attention for his integration of social media into local newscasts.
In summer 2016, changes were brought to KNBC&#x27;s daytime lineup which led to the restoration of the 4 p.m. newscast, allowing the station to complete with KCBS-TV and its sister independent station KCAL-TV (which moved its 4 p.m. newscast from KCBS-TV in 2002) and KABC-TV (which began airing its 4 p.m. newscast into the period in September 1980). On July 24, 2016, KNBC became the tenth (and final) NBC-owned station and the third (and final) owned station in the West Coast to use its &quot;Look N&quot; graphics that is first implemented by the NBC O&amp;Os in the East Coast in summer of that year; also its mic flags were updated, the color scheme was now blue with a white 4 instead of its white with a blue 4 color scheme; before this, KNBC along with sister stations KNTV and KNSD revamped their websites on July 1, 2016. In July 2016, KNBC entered into a partnership agreement with Cumulus Media—owned KABC radio to carry the simulcasts of the first half-hour of &quot;Today in L.A.&quot; morning newscasts and the station&#x27;s 6 p.m. weeknight newscasts; additionally, some of the station&#x27;s on-air talent occasionally appeared as guests on KABC&#x27;s programs.

On July 31, 2017, KNBC began its expansion of &quot;Today in L.A.&quot; morning newscast, an extra half-hour was added to begin its start time to 4 am; additionally, became the second station in Los Angeles and Southern California to expand it to the time period, following KTLA who began expanding its morning newscast to their time period in 2012.

On January 2, 2019, it was announced that the station&#x27;s hour-long midday newscast will be cutting to a half-hour along with its in-state sister stations KNTV and KNSD in favor of the brand new lifestyle show &quot;California Live&quot; beginning January 7.

On June 7, 2021, KNBC premiered a new 30-minute 7 p.m. newscast.

In January 2022, KNBC announced that they will plan to launch a new streaming channel for NBCUniversal&#x27;s streaming service Peacock, under the name of &quot;NBC LA News&quot;; this comes following the announcement they would have a simultaneous rollout of streaming news channels starting with its sister stations in Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia and Boston launching on January 20; the said channel was launched on March 17, 2022.

On September 12, 2022, KNBC premiered a new 30-minute 3 p.m. newscast, followed by &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;.

====News team====
KNBC has had a very stable news team over the years: weeknight anchor Colleen Williams (who also occasionally reports for MSNBC and NBC News) and sports anchor Fred Roggin (also has the nickname &quot;The Dean of L.A. Sports&quot; and serves as a commentator for NBC&#x27;s Olympics coverage) have each been at the station at least thirty years or more. Former chief weathercaster Fritz Coleman (who like Roggin, has also occasionally appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and once hosted a late-night variety show for KNBC called &quot;It&#x27;s Fritz&quot; from 1989 to the early 1990s) worked at the station from 1982 until his June 2020 retirement. Former anchor Paul Moyer worked two stints at channel 4; first from 1972 to 1979 (when he began a 13-year run at rival KABC-TV) and from July 1992 until his April 2009 retirement. Like Moyer, anchor Chuck Henry was also a mainstay at KABC-TV, before making the move to channel 4 in January 1994. Kelly Lange, Stu Nahan, John Schubeck, Tritia Toyota, Jess Marlow, David Sheehan, John Beard and Nick Clooney are other notables who have worked on KNBC&#x27;s newscasts in the past. Another KNBC alum of note is consumer reporter David Horowitz, whose long-running syndicated series, &quot;Fight Back!&quot;, began on channel 4 and was produced and distributed by NBC and Group W. In 1987 during an afternoon newscast, a gun-wielding mental patient gained access to NBC Studios and took Horowitz hostage live on-air. With the gun pressed to his side, Horowitz calmly read the gunman&#x27;s statements on camera. The man, identified as Gary Stollman, was caught with a toy gun and was arrested by local police. It led Horowitz to start a successful campaign to ban &quot;look-alike&quot; toy guns in several states, including California and New York.

Tom Brokaw began his NBC career as an anchor and reporter at KNBC in 1966, staying until he went over to national work for NBC News in 1973. Other notables who have worked at KNBC early in their careers prior to joining the network include Bryant Gumbel, Ross Porter, Pat Sajak, Kent Shocknek, Bob Abernethy, Keith Morrison and Tom Snyder.

<text>Patrick Scott (24 January 1921 – 14 February 2014) was an Irish artist.

Patrick Scott was born in Kilbrittain, County Cork, in 1921, and had his first exhibition in 1944, but trained as an architect and did not become a full-time artist until 1960. He worked for fifteen years for the Irish architect Michael Scott, assisting, for example, in the design of Busáras, the central bus station in Dublin. He was also responsible for the black and orange livery of Irish intercity trains.

Scott was perhaps best known for his &quot;gold paintings&quot;, abstracts incorporating geometrical forms in gold leaf against a pale tempura background. He also produced tapestries and carpets.

His paintings are in several important collections including the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He won the Guggenheim Award in 1960, represented Ireland in the 1960 Venice Biennale, the Douglas Hyde Gallery held a major retrospective of his work in 1981 and the Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin held a major survey in 2002. His works are distinguished by their purity and sense of calm, reflecting his interest in Zen Buddhism.

In October 2013, Scott wed his companion of 30 years, Eric Pearce, in a civil ceremony at the Dublin Registry Office.

On 11 July 2007, Scott, who was a founding member of Aosdána, was conferred with the title of Saoi, the highest honour that can be bestowed upon an Irish artist. The President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, made the presentation, placing a gold torc, the symbol of the office of Saoi, around his neck. No more than seven living members may hold this honour at any one time.

Scott died on 14 February 2014 at the age of 93. He was survived by his partner.

In January 2021 An Post issued a special stamp featuring Scott&#x27;s work for the centenary of his birth.
