<text>TFO is a Canadian French language educational television channel and media organization serving the province of Ontario. It is operated by the Ontario French-language Educational Communications Authority (OTELFO), a Crown corporation owned by the Government of Ontario and trading as Groupe Média TFO. It is the only French-language television service in Canada that operates entirely outside Quebec. The network airs cultural programming, including blocks of French-language children&#x27;s programs, along with original series, documentaries, and films.

The network was first established in 1987 as La Chaîne TVO, a spin-off of the provincial English-language public broadcaster TVO, later re-branding as TFO in 1997. The network operated under the auspices of TVO until 2007, when it was spun off into an autonomous agency.

TFO is available on multichannel television providers throughout Ontario; all cable and IPTV providers in the province are required to carry it on their basic tier. TFO is also carried nationally on the Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct satellite television services. The network previously broadcast over-the-air in some communities in Eastern and Northern Ontario with significant Franco-Ontarian populations; these transmitters ceased operations in 2012.

==History==
When TVO (then known as TVOntario) launched in 1970, it aired French-language programming on Sundays from noon until sign-off. By the 1980s, the provincial government concluded that a separate francophone educational network was needed to prevent the &quot;ghettoization&quot; of the Franco-Ontarian community.

In 1985, the Ontario Ministry of Municipal and Cultural Affairs, together with Communications Canada, approved the creation of an Ontario-based French-language educational television network. At the time, the only portions of Ontario with access to a dedicated francophone educational television service were the National Capital Region and the Ottawa Valley, which were served by Radio-Québec outlet CIVO-TV in Hull. In 1986, the new network received its broadcast licence from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). On January 1, 1987, this network was officially launched by the Ontario Educational Communications Authority under the name La Chaîne TVO (primarily known on-air as La Chaîne). In 1997, La Chaîne was renamed TFO (short for Télévision française de l&#x27;Ontario). The company would remain a part of TVO until 2007 when it was transferred to the Ontario French-language Educational Communications Authority, a separate crown corporation. It is the only French-language television broadcaster in Canada headquartered outside Quebec.

For the first decade of La Chaîne&#x27;s operations, TVO&#x27;s existing practice of broadcasting in French on Sundays continued, and La Chaîne aired English-language programming during the same time block. This was because La Chaîne was only available on cable at first, and the government wanted to ensure that Franco-Ontarian viewers without cable still had access to a block of French-language programming while making English TVO programs available on La Chaîne for those who wanted them. As transmitters were added in several French-speaking communities, the practice was discontinued in the mid-1990s.
In addition to being carried throughout Ontario on cable and via over-the-air transmitters in some communities, in October 1997 TFO began broadcasting in New Brunswick via select cable companies in that province. New Brunswick was the first jurisdiction other than Ontario where TFO was offered. TFO would later be broadcast into parts of Quebec as well. In 1998, the station began broadcasting nationally via both national satellite companies, Bell ExpressVu and Star Choice, now known as Bell Satellite TV and Shaw Direct, respectively. In August 2008, Star Choice removed TFO from its lineup. In 1999, TFO&#x27;s parent company at the time, The Ontario Educational Communications Authority, applied to the CRTC for mandatory carriage of TFO in the province of Quebec, in addition to a carriage fee, which other over-the-air services do not receive. However, the CRTC denied its application in March 2000. That year Jacques Bensimon, co-founder of the network and managing director of the network since 1986 (before it became its own channel), resigned from the position. Over his tenure, he formed relationships between TFO and French-language networks in Europe, in order to share content. This included co-producing content with the BBC, France 2 and Channel 4 in the UK.


As part of a restructuring of TVO announced by the McGuinty government on June 29, 2006, TFO was taken over by a new, separate provincial Crown corporation, the Ontario French-Language Educational Communications Authority (&quot;Office des télécommunications éducatives de langue française de l’Ontario&quot; or &quot;OTÉLFO&quot;) in 2007, with separate management and its own budget. Although the licence transfer was not officially approved by the CRTC until June 28, 2007, TFO nonetheless announced its autonomy from TVO effective April 1. GroupeMédia TFO is funded mainly by the Government of Ontario, through the Ministry of Education, with an annual budget of $31 million. Additional contributions have been made by the Government of Manitoba since the channel was added to cable services in that province in 2010.

In 2010, then TFO CEO Claudette Paquin was awarded the Commissioner of Official Language&#x27;s Award of Excellence – Promotion of Linguistic Duality for her leadership in TFO&#x27;s transition to more autonomy, and the work the channel has done to promote the development of the Franco-Ontarian community.

In April 2016, TFO announced that it had established a partnership with Louisiana Public Broadcasting to syndicate 14 hours per-week of French-language children&#x27;s programming to the broadcaster&#x27;s LPB2 service. The partnership is designed to appeal to Louisiana&#x27;s strong French heritage and French immersion programs.

In December 2024, Xavier Brassard-Bédard, a former chief editor and director of TVA Nouvelles and LCN, was appointed as TFO&#x27;s new chief executive officer.

==Television and web programming==
At its launch in 1987, the channel&#x27;s programming schedule included both original programming produced by the network, such as the educational comedy series &quot;17, rue Laurier&quot;, the health series &quot;La santé contagieuse&quot; and the newsmagazine series &quot;M.E.M.O.&quot;, and acquired programming from both Quebec and France, such as the children&#x27;s series &quot;Passe-Partout&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;île aux enfants&quot; and the talk show &quot;Apostrophes&quot;. It also aired a francophone dub of the 1970s English Canadian children&#x27;s series &quot;Matt and Jenny&quot;, under the title &quot;La route de l&#x27;amitié&quot;.

===Main shows===
GroupeMédia TFO broadcasts educational and cultural content for all of its audiences (children, youth, and adults). Programs that TFO produces include &quot;Mini TFO&quot; (for pre-school children), &quot;Mégallô&quot; (for children ages 9 to 12), &quot;RelieF&quot; (a political, social, and cultural program aired live Monday through Thursday), the sitcom &quot;Météo+&quot;, and Ruby TFO, a Web/TV magazine for women. TFO&#x27;s prime time programming includes documentaries and dramatic series, along with unique French-language film programming, including feature-length art films and films from around the world. &quot;CinéTFO&quot; is the network&#x27;s nightly showing of French-language cinema.

===Music programming===
&quot;BRBR&quot; is another music show, featuring reviews, interviews, and performances from French-speaking artists. The concerts take place in downtown Toronto and Montreal in front of live crowds. The show has been nominated for several Gemini Awards. In October 2013 &quot;BRBR&quot; teamed with Deezer to launch an online radio station dedicated to the music of Francophone Canadians. Other music programming includes the series &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot;, which shows the backstage, studio, and other parts of the music industry generally hidden from the public eye. TFO also broadcasts the singing competition reality show &quot;JAM&quot;.

===Mini TFO===
Mini TFO provides YouTube channels for young children, receiving 25 million views between its launch and October 2014 - the second most views of any children&#x27;s channel in the world. TFO has also focused on mobile broadcasting, developing several apps for children&#x27;s use. Other apps are developed to provide parents with a rating and research mechanism when deciding between programming and apps developed for child viewers or educational use - such as EduLulu. In 2013 Mini TFO also opened the Mini TFO Centre for Early Childhood Education at Collège Boréal. The channel also sponsors live tours of its affiliated acts, specifically in remote areas of Ontario. Children&#x27;s programming on TFO is integrated into its web programming, which includes mobile applications designed for child development. TFO also produces reality television shows featuring kids, including the &quot;Amazing Race&quot; style series &quot;Les Jumelles&quot; where local kids compete against each other in teams of two.

The TFO website also provides curriculum support, pedagogical guides, and 4,000 different educational programs (1600 available for free). TFO itself has training programs to teach educators how to use video materials in the classroom, attended by 2,000 teachers per year. TFO is Canada&#x27;s largest producer and distributor of French-language educational products.

==Former transmitters==
From 1989 to 2012, TFO operated several over-the-air transmitters in predominantly francophone areas of Eastern and Northern Ontario. These transmitters had the callsign CHLF-TV, followed by a number to denote their status as rebroadcasters. Besides Sudbury, Hawkesbury, Temiskaming Shores and Pembroke, TFO otherwise transmitted over the air mainly in isolated portions of Northern Ontario without access to cable.

As part of the transfer of TFO to its own management in 2007, the transmitters in Sultan, Oba and Jogues were taken out of service. On July 31, 2012, TFO shut down its transmitters in Sudbury, Hawkesbury, Pembroke and Lac-Sainte-Thérèse, as TVO, which owned the towers, was shutting down and decommissioning all its analog transmitters on that day. As of December 2012, the station no longer has any over-the-air transmitters as evidenced by the disappearance from Industry Canada&#x27;s TV spectrum database of TFO&#x27;s over-the-air transmitters.

<text>Transvision Vamp were an English pop rock band. Formed in 1986 by Nick Christian Sayer and Wendy James, the band enjoyed chart success in the late 1980s, particularly in 1989. James, the lead singer and focal-point of the group, attracted media attention with her sexually charged and rebellious image. The band had 10 UK chart hits and also enjoyed considerable success in Australia. Transvision Vamp&#x27;s top single was 1989&#x27;s &quot;Baby I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, which reached number three in the UK and Australian charts.

== Career ==

The band&#x27;s original line-up was James, Sayer, Dave Parsons (bass), Tex Axile (keyboards) and Pol Burton (drums). Sayer was originally in an early Punk band formed in 1977 and based in Bexhill-on-Sea called The Plastics, later Plastix, playing gigs in Hastings, Eastbourne, Brighton and in London at The Roxy. When The Plastix split Nick and the drummer Mark Storr Hoggins joined the Brighton band, Midnight and the Lemon Boys who supported U2 on their first UK tour in 1979. Parsons and Axile had also both been in punk bands prior to joining the band; Parsons in The Partisans, and Axile in various bands, most notably The Moors Murderers and X-Ray Spex offshoot Agent Orange.

Transvision Vamp were signed by MCA in December 1986 with the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Revolution Baby&quot;, being released the following year. It stalled at number 77 in the UK in September 1987. A cover of the Holly and the Italians&#x27; song, &quot;Tell That Girl to Shut Up&quot;, was released as the band&#x27;s second single in March 1988, reaching 45 on the UK Singles Chart. The single became the band&#x27;s only charting entry on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it peaked at 87.

Transvision Vamp&#x27;s third single, &quot;I Want Your Love&quot;, with its pop/punk crossover appeal, became the band&#x27;s first major hit, topping the Norwegian singles chart, and peaking within the top 10 in the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland. The next single was a re-release of &quot;Revolution Baby&quot;, which rose to number 30 in the UK, 17 in Ireland, 24 in Australia and New Zealand. The fourth single, &quot;Sister Moon&quot;, narrowly missed the UK top 40 at number 41.

In October 1988 the band released their debut album, &quot;Pop Art&quot;. It was a major success in the UK where it stayed on the album chart for 32 weeks, peaking at number 4. The album achieved a similar level of success in Australia, where it was certified platinum, and placed as the 25th highest-selling album of 1989. The album also did well in Switzerland (number 20) and Sweden (number 25).

1989 proved to be Transvision Vamp&#x27;s most successful year, with the release of the single &quot;Baby I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; which peaked at number three in both the UK and Australia, making it the band&#x27;s most successful single in both countries. In Australia, the song spent 20 weeks in the top 50. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Velveteen&quot;, was released shortly after, debuting atop the UK Albums Chart and remaining on the chart for 26 weeks. &quot;Velveteen&quot; also reached number two on the Australian Albums Chart, spending 25 weeks in the top 100, becoming the 39th best selling album of the year. &quot;Velveteen&quot; was also a significant success in New Zealand (reaching number 12), and parts of Europe, including Switzerland, Germany and Norway, where it entered the top twenty. The other singles from &quot;Velveteen&quot;: &quot;The Only One&quot;, &quot;Landslide of Love&quot; and &quot;Born to Be Sold&quot; all peaked within the top 30 in the UK, and the top 20 in Ireland.

In June 1991, MCA refused to release Transvision Vamp&#x27;s third album &quot;Little Magnets Versus the Bubble of Babble&quot; in the UK, reportedly disliking the direction of the music and after the two singles released from the album didn&#x27;t chart as highly as previous singles on the UK charts. The album was, however, released in New Zealand, where it reached number 14, and in Australia, where it peaked at number 25 and spent 3 months in the ARIA top 100 albums chart. It was also released in Sweden and reached number 27. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;(I Just Wanna) B with U&quot;, peaked at number 16 in Australia, and charted at number 30 in the UK also entering the Irish top 30. The second single released from the album, &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot;, entered the top 40 in New Zealand and just missed the UK top 40 at number 41; it became the band&#x27;s final single release. A third single from the album, &quot;Twangy Wigout&quot; was planned and promo copies were issued but it was shelved by their label after disputes. Of the third album, James has stated &quot;it came out in America. But then we decided to split up, during which time the English record label had said they weren&#x27;t convinced about this record, we&#x27;re going to hold off on it and see how well it does in other countries first. By the time they were ready to release it, we&#x27;d already decided to split up, and so it never came out.&quot;

The group officially disbanded in February 1992 following a statement from MCA. Wendy James launched her solo career in 1993 with the Elvis Costello-written album &quot;Now Ain&#x27;t the Time for Your Tears&quot;.

== Post-Vamp activities ==
Anthony Doughty (Tex Axile) joined a band called &#x27;Max&#x27; with Matthew Ashman, Kevin Mooney, John Reynolds and John Keogh in which he played keyboards. They released a Trevor Horn-produced album &quot;Silence Running&quot; in 1992. Keogh died soon after the release and Ashman a couple of years later. Doughty continues to release solo albums on his own label.

Dave Parsons joined British post-grunge band Bush, who would achieve commercial success in the 1990s.

Wendy James embarked on a solo career, with limited commercial success. Although her 1993 album &quot;Now Ain&#x27;t the Time for Your Tears&quot; (written by Elvis Costello) reached number 43 on the UK Albums Chart, none of the three singles released from it entered the UK Top 30. The lead single, &quot;The Nameless One&quot;, reached 34 on the UK Singles Chart, while the second single, &quot;London&#x27;s Brilliant&quot;, peaked at only number 62 And the third single, &quot;Do You Know What I&#x27;m Saying?&quot;, reached number 78 in the UK. MCA and James parted company in August of that same year.

A follow-up solo album, recorded for One Little Indian Records, was not released. In 2004, James formed a band named Racine, with which she released two albums. Neither album charted anywhere. A single, &quot;Grease Monkey&quot;, charted at number 114 in the UK in April 2005. Racine broke up and closed down their official band site in December 2008.

<text>Melbourn () is a large, clustered village in the far south-west of Cambridgeshire, England. Its traditional high street is bypassed by the A10, intersecting the settlement&#x27;s other main axis exactly northwest of the traditional focal point of Royston, Hertfordshire, the nearest larger settlement. It has over 4,600 inhabitants and is in the South Cambridgeshire district.

The Prime Meridian passes to the west of Melbourn.

==History==
The parish has a long history of occupation, stemming from the presence of springs at Melbourn Bury and the several ancient trackways that cross the parish; the Icknield Way runs to the south of the parish and Ashwell Street and the Roman Cambridge-Royston road are also believed to follow prehistoric trackways. Pottery and burial finds show evidence of Bronze Age residents, and a Roman settlement has been found at the north-east edge of the village. Excavations in the 1950s discovered 28 graves from a 7th-century Christian burial site close to Ashwell Street.

Melbourn appears in five entries in Domesday Book.
The name &quot;Melbourn&quot; comes from &quot;Meldeburn&quot;, the &quot;stream of a man named Melde&quot;.

==Church==

The finding of a Saxon cemetery shows that Christianity has been present in Melbourn since the 7th century. The village also probably had an 11th-century chapel but the first record of a church is from 1152. The present church, dedicated to All Saints, is Grade II* listed. R.R. Rowe conducted a major restoration in 1882 but the church includes sections of the 13th-century building, including the chancel arch and sections of the tower. The font is 11th century.

==Village life==
It has a primary school and a secondary school, Melbourn Village College. There is also a well-known science park. There is a butcher&#x27;s, a co-op food shop, five hairdressers, a barber shop, two estate agents, two pubs, a newsagent, a sub-post office, two garages and three churches (Anglican, Baptist and URC). Sheene Mill, on the River Mel northwest of the village, is now a hotel and restaurant, formerly owned by the television chef Steven Saunders.

The nearest railway station is , in the neighbouring village, which opened in 1851 on the Cambridge line.

===Pubs===
Melbourn was much visited by travellers by the 17th century and is listed as having an inn in 1622. By the late 18th century the village supported three: the &quot;Dog&quot;, of unknown history, the &quot;Red Lion&quot;, that closed towards the end of the 19th century, and the &quot;Hoops&quot;, that closed in the early 20th century. In 1865 the village had 11 inns and pubs, including the &quot;Black Horse&quot;, the &quot;Star&quot;, the &quot;White Lion&quot;, the &quot;Anchor&quot;, the &quot;Carriers Arm&quot;s and the &quot;Red Cow&quot;. The &quot;Rose Inn&quot; and the &quot;Coach and Horses&quot; opened in around 1850.

The oldest of the two present public houses is the &quot;Dolphin&quot;, which dates from 1818. The other is the &quot;Black Horse&quot;.

<text>Rebecca is a 1938 Gothic novel by the English author Daphne du Maurier. It depicts an unnamed young woman who impetuously marries a wealthy widower, before discovering that both he and his household are haunted by the memory of his late first wife, the title character.

A bestseller which has never gone out of print, &quot;Rebecca&quot; sold 2.8 million copies between its publication in 1938 and 1965. It has been adapted numerous times for stage and screen, including a 1939 play by du Maurier herself, the film &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), directed by Alfred Hitchcock, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and the 2020 remake directed by Ben Wheatley for Netflix. The story has been adapted as a musical.

The novel is remembered especially for the character Mrs Danvers, the West Country estate Manderley, and its opening line: &quot;Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again.&quot;

==Plot==
While working as the companion to a rich American woman on holiday in Monte Carlo, the unnamed narrator, a naïve young woman in her early 20s, becomes acquainted with a wealthy Englishman, Maxim de Winter, a 42-year-old widower. After a fortnight of courtship, she agrees to marry him and, after the wedding and honeymoon, accompanies him to his mansion in Cornwall, the beautiful estate Manderley.

Mrs Danvers, the sinister housekeeper, was profoundly devoted to the first Mrs de Winter, Rebecca, who died in a sailing accident about a year before Maxim and the second Mrs de Winter met. She continually attempts to undermine the narrator psychologically, subtly suggesting to her that she will never attain the beauty, urbanity, and charm her predecessor possessed. When the narrator makes small requests, Mrs Danvers and the other staff describe how Rebecca ran Manderley when she was alive. Cowed by Mrs Danvers&#x27; imposing manner and the other members of West Country society&#x27;s unwavering reverence for Rebecca, the narrator becomes isolated.

The narrator is soon convinced that Maxim regrets his impetuous decision to marry her, and that he is still deeply in love with the seemingly perfect Rebecca. At the pressing of neighbours, Manderley hosts a costume ball, a custom Rebecca had instated. On the suggestion of Mrs Danvers, the narrator wears a replica of the dress shown in a portrait of one of the house&#x27;s former inhabitants, ignorant of the fact that Rebecca had worn the same costume to much acclaim shortly before her death. When the narrator enters the hall and Maxim sees the dress, he angrily orders her to change.

Shortly after the ball, Mrs Danvers reveals her contempt for the narrator, believing she is trying to replace Rebecca, and reveals her deep, unhealthy obsession with the dead woman. Mrs Danvers tries to get the narrator to commit suicide by encouraging her to jump out of the window. However, she is interrupted before the narrator does so by the disturbance caused by a nearby shipwreck. A diver investigating the wrecked ship&#x27;s hull condition also discovers the remains of Rebecca&#x27;s sailing boat, with her decomposed body still on board, despite Maxim having identified another body that had washed ashore two months after Rebecca&#x27;s death.

This discovery causes Maxim to confess to the narrator that his marriage to Rebecca was a sham. Rebecca, Maxim reveals, was a cruel and selfish woman who took many lovers while manipulating everyone around her into believing her to be the perfect wife and a paragon of virtue. On the night of her death, she taunted Maxim with the prospect of having another man&#x27;s child, which she would raise under the pretense that it was Maxim&#x27;s, and he would be unable to prove otherwise. Enraged, Maxim shot and killed Rebecca. He then disposed of her body by placing it in her boat and sinking it at sea. The narrator is relieved to hear that Maxim has always loved her and never Rebecca.

Rebecca&#x27;s boat is raised, and it is discovered to have been deliberately sunk. An inquest brings a verdict of suicide. However, Rebecca&#x27;s first cousin and lover, Jack Favell, attempts to blackmail Maxim, claiming she could not have intended suicide based on a note she sent to him the night she died. It is revealed that Rebecca had had an appointment with a doctor in London shortly before her death, which the narrator suspects was to confirm a pregnancy. When the doctor is found, he reveals that Rebecca had cancer and would have died within a few months. Furthermore, due to the malformation of her uterus, she could never have been pregnant. Maxim assumes that Rebecca, knowing that she would die, manipulated him into killing her quickly. Mrs Danvers had said after the inquiry that Rebecca feared nothing except dying a lingering death.

On hearing that Mrs Danvers has abruptly disappeared from Manderley, Maxim feels a great sense of foreboding and insists on driving through the night to return home. Before they come in sight of the house, it is clear from a glow on the horizon and wind-borne ashes that it is ablaze.

==Characters==
===Principal characters===
* The Narrator/the Second Mrs de Winter: A timid, naïve, middle-class woman in her early twenties, who enjoys sketching. Neither the narrator&#x27;s first nor maiden name is revealed. She is referred to as &quot;my wife&quot;, &quot;Mrs de Winter&quot;, &quot;my dear&quot;, and so on. The one time she is introduced with a name is during a fancy dress ball, in which she dresses as a de Winter ancestor and is introduced as &quot;Caroline de Winter&quot;, although this is clearly not her own name. She signs her name as &quot;Mrs M. de Winter&quot;, using Maxim&#x27;s initial. Early in the novel she receives a letter and remarks that her name was correctly spelled, which is &quot;an unusual thing,&quot; suggesting her name is uncommon, foreign or complex. While courting her, Maxim compliments her on her &quot;lovely and unusual name&quot;. Despite her timidity, she matures throughout the events of the novel, refusing to be a victim of Rebecca&#x27;s phantom-like influence any longer and becoming a strong, assertive woman in her own right.
* Maximilian &quot;Maxim&quot; de Winter: The reserved, unemotional owner of Manderley. He marries his new wife after a brief courtship, yet displays little affection toward her after the marriage. Emotionally scarred by his traumatic marriage to Rebecca, his distance toward his new wife causes her to fear he regrets his marriage to her and is still haunted by Rebecca&#x27;s death. Maxim killed Rebecca after she taunted him with the prospect of having a lover&#x27;s child that he would have to raise as his own. He eventually reveals to his new wife that he never loved Rebecca, but not until several months of marriage have passed.
* Mrs Danvers: The cold, overbearing housekeeper of Manderley. Danvers was Rebecca&#x27;s family maid when she was a child and has lived with her for years. She is unhealthily obsessed with Rebecca and preserving Rebecca&#x27;s memory. She resents the new Mrs de Winter, convinced she is trying to &quot;take Rebecca&#x27;s place&quot;. She tries to undermine the new Mrs de Winter, but her efforts fail. After her scheme is ruined, Mrs Danvers apparently burns Manderley to the ground, preferring to destroy it than allow Maxim to share his home with another lover and wife. She is nicknamed Danny which is derived from her last name; her first name being unknown or unimportant, but in Sally Beauman&#x27;s sequel &quot;Rebecca&#x27;s Tale&quot; it was said to be Edith. 
* Rebecca de Winter: The unseen, deceased title character, who has been dead for less than a year. A famous beauty, and on the surface a devoted wife and perfect hostess, Rebecca was actually unfaithful to her husband Maxim. Her lingering presence overwhelms Manderley, dominating the visitors, the staff and the new Mrs de Winter. Through dialogue, it is slowly revealed that Rebecca possessed the signs of a psychopath: habitual lying, superficial charm, expert manipulation, no conscience and no remorse. She was also revealed to be somewhat sadistic—Danvers tells a story of Rebecca, during her teenage years, cruelly whipping a horse until it bled.

===Minor characters===
* Frank Crawley: The hard-working, dutiful agent of Manderley. He is said to be Maxim&#x27;s trusted advisor and faithful confidant. He soon becomes a good friend to the second Mrs de Winter, and helps her in the self-doubt of her ability to rule Manderley as its mistress. Rebecca attempted to seduce him in the past.
* Beatrice Lacy (formerly de Winter): Maxim&#x27;s wilful and quick-witted sister, who develops an immediate fondness for the new Mrs de Winter. Prior to the novel, she had married Giles Lacy. She is one of the few people, along with her brother, who knew Rebecca&#x27;s true, vile nature, and was one of her victims: Beatrice&#x27;s husband was seduced by her. She and Giles have a son, Roger.
* Giles Lacy: The slightly slow-witted husband of Beatrice, and Maxim&#x27;s brother-in-law. He was one of the many men who fell for Rebecca&#x27;s charms.
* Frith: The middle-aged, kind and devoted butler at Manderley. He already worked for the de Winters when Maxim was a boy.
* Robert: A footman.
* Mrs Van Hopper: The narrator&#x27;s employer at the beginning of the novel, an obnoxious, overbearing American woman who relentlessly pursues wealthy and famous guests at the various hotels she stays at in order to latch on to their fame and boost her own status through association.
* Clarice: Mrs de Winter&#x27;s young maid. She excitedly aided the narrator fitting her gown for the fancy dress ball. 
* Jack Favell: Rebecca&#x27;s disreputable first cousin and her most frequent lover. He and Rebecca grew up together and he shares many of her worst traits. He is strongly disliked by Maxim and several other characters. Since Rebecca&#x27;s death, he remains in touch with Mrs Danvers, whom he calls &quot;Danny&quot;, just as Rebecca had done.
* Gran: Maxim and Beatrice&#x27;s senile 86-year-old maternal grandmother, who was largely responsible for their upbringing but is now an invalid. Mrs de Winter accompanies Beatrice on a visit in order to meet Gran, who is unable to understand that Rebecca is dead and Maxim has remarried. She continually asks about Rebecca, which leads to Beatrice cutting their visit short.
* Colonel Julyan: The investigator in the inquest into the cause of Rebecca&#x27;s death, and Favell&#x27;s subsequent accusation of Maxim. He ultimately aids Maxim in avoiding prosecution, despite suspecting the truth.
* Dr Baker: A doctor, who specializes in gynaecology. A few hours before her death, Rebecca went to see him in secret, when he diagnosed her with an unspecified type of cancer.

==Locations==
* The fictional Hôtel Côte d&#x27;Azur, Monte Carlo
* The fictional Manderley, a country estate which du Maurier&#x27;s editor noted &quot;is as much an atmosphere as a tangible erection of stones and mortar&quot;
* a fictional hotel somewhere overseas with a warm climate, where the Maxim and his second wife temporarily live after Manderley was burnt

==Development==
In 1937, Daphne du Maurier signed a three-book deal with Victor Gollancz and accepted an advance of £1,000. A 2008 article in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; indicates she had been toying with the theme of jealousy for the five years since her marriage in 1932. She started &quot;sluggishly&quot; and wrote a desperate apology to Gollancz: &quot;The first 15,000 words I tore up in disgust and this literary miscarriage has cast me down rather.&quot;

Her husband, Tommy &quot;Boy&quot; Browning, was Lieutenant Colonel of the Grenadier Guards and they were posted to Alexandria, Egypt, with the Second Battalion, leaving Britain on 30 July 1937. Gollancz expected her manuscript on their return to Britain in December but she wrote that she was &quot;ashamed to tell you that progress is slow on the new novel...There is little likelihood of my bringing back a finished manuscript in December.&quot;

On returning to Britain in December 1937, du Maurier decided to spend Christmas away from her family to write the book and she successfully delivered it to her publisher less than four months later. Du Maurier described the plot as &quot;a sinister tale about a woman who marries a widower...Psychological and rather macabre.&quot;

===Derivation and inspiration===
Some commentators have noted parallels with Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Another of du Maurier&#x27;s works, &quot;Jamaica Inn,&quot; is also linked to one of the Brontë sisters&#x27; works, Emily&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.

While du Maurier &quot;categorised &quot;Rebecca&quot; as a study in jealousy ... she admitted its origins in her own life to few.&quot; Her husband had been previously engaged to Jan Ricardo, a glamorous dark-haired figure. Du Maurier was apparently haunted by the suspicion that Browning remained attracted to Ricardo. In &quot;The Rebecca Notebook&quot; of 1981, du Maurier recalled the novel&#x27;s gestation: &quot;Seeds began to drop. A beautiful home ... a first wife ... jealousy, a wreck, perhaps at sea, near to the house ... But something terrible would have to happen, I did not know what...&quot; In her preliminary notes for the novel, she wrote: &quot;I want to build up the character of the first [wife] in the mind of the second...until wife 2 is haunted day and night...a tragedy is looming very close and CRASH! BANG! something happens.&quot;

Like Rebecca and Maximilian de Winter, du Maurier and her husband were not faithful to one another. Jan Ricardo eventually died by suicide during the Second World War, throwing herself under a train.

Du Maurier commented publicly in her lifetime that the book was based on her own memories of Menabilly and Cornwall, as well as her relationship with her father. The depictions of Manderly may have been influenced by du Maurier&#x27;s childhood visits to Milton Hall, Cambridgeshire (then in Northamptonshire) home of the Wentworth-Fitzwilliam family.

===Plagiarism allegations===
Shortly after &quot;Rebecca&quot; was published in Brazil, critic Álvaro Lins pointed out many resemblances between du Maurier&#x27;s book and the work of Brazilian writer Carolina Nabuco. Nabuco&#x27;s &quot;A Sucessora&quot; (&quot;The Successor&quot;), published in 1934, has a main plot similar to &quot;Rebecca&quot;, for example a young woman marrying a widower and the strange presence of the first wife—plot features also shared with the far older &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Nina Auerbach alleged in her book &quot;Daphne du Maurier, Haunted Heiress&quot;, that du Maurier read the English version of the Brazilian book when the first drafts were sent to the same publisher as hers in order to be published in England, and based her famous best-seller on it.

Immediately following a 1941 article in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; highlighting the two novels&#x27; many similarities, du Maurier issued a rebuttal in a letter to the editor. According to Nabuco&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Eight Decades&quot;, she (Nabuco) refused to sign an agreement brought to her by a United Artists&#x27; representative in which she would concede that the similarities between her book and the movie were mere coincidence. A further, ironic complication in Nabuco&#x27;s allegations is the similarity between her novel and the novel &quot;Encarnação&quot;, written by José de Alencar, one of Brazil&#x27;s most celebrated novelists of the nineteenth century, and published posthumously in 1893.

In 1944, according to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, du Maurier; her U.S. publishers Doubleday; and United Artists, distributors of the film adaptation, were sued for plagiarism by Edwina Levin MacDonald who alleged that du Maurier had copied her 1927 novel &quot;Blind Windows&quot;, and sought an undisclosed amount of accounting and damages. The complaint was eventually dismissed on 14 January 1948.

==Publishing history==
Du Maurier delivered the manuscript to her publisher, Victor Gollancz, in April 1938. On receipt, the book was read in Gollancz&#x27;s office, and her &quot;editor, Norman Collins, reported simply: &#x27;The new Daphne du Maurier contains everything that the public could want.&#x27;&quot; Gollancz&#x27;s &quot;reaction to &quot;Rebecca&quot; was relief and jubilation&quot; and &quot;a &#x27;rollicking success&#x27; was predicted by him.&quot; He &quot;did not hang around&quot; and &quot;ordered a first print run of 20,000 copies and within a month &quot;Rebecca&quot; had sold more than twice that number.&quot; The novel has been continuously in print since 1938 and in 1993 &quot;du Maurier&#x27;s US publishers Avon estimated ongoing monthly paperback sales of &quot;Rebecca&quot; at more than 4,000 copies.&quot;

===Promotion===
Du Maurier &quot;did several radio interviews with BBC and other stations&quot; and &quot;attended Foyle&#x27;s Literary Lunch&quot; in August 1938 while &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;, and &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot; published articles on du Maurier.

===Print history===
&quot;Rebecca&quot; is listed in the 20th-Century American Bestsellers descriptive bibliography database maintained by the University of Illinois. The entry, by Katherine Huber, provided the detailed information on the English and American editions as well as translations listed below.

== Critical Reception and Awards ==
&quot;The Times&quot; stated that &quot;the material is of the humblest ... nothing in this is beyond the novelette.&quot; In the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; of 14 September 1938, V.S. Pritchett predicted the novel &quot;would be here today, gone tomorrow.&quot;

More recently, in a column for &quot;The Independent&quot;, the critics Ceri Radford and Chris Harvey recommended the book and argued that &quot;Rebecca&quot; is a &quot;marvellously gothic tale&quot; with a good dose of atmospheric and psychological horror.

Few critics saw in the novel what the author wanted them to see: the exploration of the relationship between a man who is powerful and a woman who is not.

In the U.S., du Maurier won the National Book Award for favourite novel of 1938, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 14 on the UK survey The Big Read.

In 2017, it was voted the UK&#x27;s favourite book of the past 225 years in a poll by bookseller W H Smith. Other novels in the shortlist were &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; by Charlotte Brontë, and &quot;1984&quot; by George Orwell.

On 5 November 2019, the BBC News listed &quot;Rebecca&quot; on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels.

==Adaptations==
===Film===
The best known of the theatrical film adaptations is the Academy Award–winning 1940 Alfred Hitchcock film version &quot;Rebecca&quot;, the first film Hitchcock made under his contract with David O. Selznick. The film, which starred Laurence Olivier as Maxim, Joan Fontaine as his wife, and Dame Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers, was based on the novel. However, the Hollywood Production Code required that if Maxim had murdered his wife, he would have to be punished for his crime. Therefore, the key turning point of the novel—the revelation that Maxim, in fact, murdered Rebecca—was altered so that Rebecca&#x27;s death was accidental. This change had not been made in Orson Welles&#x27; previous radio play which included a promotion of the film. At the end of the film version, Mrs Danvers perishes in the fire, which she had started. The film quickly became a classic, and at the time, was a major technical achievement in film-making.

An Indian film adaptation titled &quot;Kohraa&quot; followed in 1964, directed by Biren Nag, written by Dhruva Chatterjee, and starring Waheeda Rehman, Biswajeet and Lalita Pawar.

In 2020, there was a Netflix adaptation, directed by Ben Wheatley and written by Jane Goldman, starring Lily James as the second Mrs de Winter, Armie Hammer as Maxim, and Kristin Scott Thomas as Mrs Danvers.

===Television===
&quot;Rebecca&quot; was adapted for &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot; (10 October 1948), with Mary Anderson and Bramwell Fletcher; &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; (22 May 1950), with Barbara Bel Geddes and Peter Cookson; and &quot;Broadway Television Theatre&quot; (1 September 1952), with Patricia Breslin and Scott Forbes.

&quot;Theatre &#x27;62&quot; presented an NBC-TV adaptation starring James Mason as Maxim, Joan Hackett as the second Mrs de Winter, and Nina Foch as Mrs Danvers.

&quot;Rebecca&quot;, a 1979 BBC adaptation, was directed by Simon Langton and starred Jeremy Brett as Maxim, Joanna David as the second Mrs de Winter, and Anna Massey (Jeremy Brett&#x27;s former wife) as Mrs Danvers. It ran for four 55-minute episodes. It was broadcast in the United States on PBS as part of its &quot;Mystery!&quot; series.

&quot;Rebecca&quot;, a 1997 Carlton Television drama serial, starred Emilia Fox (Joanna David&#x27;s daughter, in the same role played by her mother in 1979), Charles Dance as de Winter, and Dame Diana Rigg as Mrs Danvers. It was directed by Jim O&#x27;Brien, with a screenplay by Arthur Hopcraft. It was broadcast in the United States by PBS as part of &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. This adaptation is noteworthy for featuring an appearance by Rebecca, played by Lucy Cohu. It also shows Maxim saving Mrs Danvers from the fire, ending with an epilogue showing Maxim and the second Mrs de Winter relaxing abroad, as she explains what she and Maxim do with their days now they are unlikely ever to return to Manderley.

In 2008, a two-part Italian TV adaption, loosely based on the novel and named &quot;Rebecca, la prima moglie&quot;, aired on the national public broadcaster RAI. The episodes feature Alessio Boni as Maxim de Winter, Cristiana Capotondi as Jennifer de Winter and Mariangela Melato as Mrs Danvers. The mini-series was filmed in Trieste.

&quot;Noor Pur Ki Rani&quot;, an Urdu language Pakistani drama television series adaptation directed by Haissam Hussain and dramatized by Pakistani writer and author Samira Fazal, was broadcast on Hum TV in 2009. The main role was played by Sanam Baloch.

===Radio===
The first adaptation of &quot;Rebecca&quot; for any medium was presented 9 December 1938, by Orson Welles, as the debut program of his live CBS Radio series &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; (the sponsored continuation of &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;). Introducing the story, Welles refers to the forthcoming motion picture adaptation by David O. Selznick; at the conclusion of the show he interviews Daphne du Maurier in London via shortwave radio. The novel was adapted by Howard E. Koch. Welles and Margaret Sullavan starred as Max de Winter and the second Mrs de Winter. Other cast included Mildred Natwick (Mrs Danvers), Ray Collins (Frank Crawley), George Coulouris (Captain Searle), Frank Readick (as Ben), Alfred Shirley (Frith), Eustace Wyatt (Coroner) and Agnes Moorehead (Mrs Van Hopper). Bernard Herrmann composed and conducted the score, which later formed the basis of his score for the 1943 film &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.

&quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; presented half-hour adaptions with Joan Fontaine, her husband at the time Brian Aherne, and Agnes Moorehead (31 May 1943), and with Loretta Young, John Lund and Agnes Moorehead (18 November 1948). Joan Fontaine and Joseph Cotten performed a half-hour adaptation 1 October 1946 on &quot;The Cresta Blanca Hollywood Players&quot;.

&quot;The Lux Radio Theatre&quot; presented hour-long adaptations with Ronald Colman, Ida Lupino and Judith Anderson (3 February 1941), and with Laurence Olivier, Vivien Leigh and Betty Blythe (6 November 1950). These were tie-ins to the Hitchcock film, and perpetuated the censorship of the novel which the Hays Office had imposed on that film, although Orson Welles&#x27; radio version which predated the film (and including a promotion for the film) was faithful to the original, asserting that Max de Winter had deliberately murdered Rebecca.

===Theatre===
Du Maurier herself adapted &quot;Rebecca&quot; as a stage play in 1939; it had a successful London run in 1940 of over 350 performances. The popular Talking Books for the blind edition read by Barbara Caruso is based on this stage adaptation; it differs materially from the novel in many respects and includes a change to the original conclusion of the novel.

A Broadway stage adaptation starring Diana Barrymore, Bramwell Fletcher and Florence Reed ran 18 January – 3 February 1945, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre.

The stage adaptation of &quot;Rebecca&quot; was produced by the Brunton Theatre Company in Musselburgh, under the direction of Charles Nowosielski, in January and February 1990.

The book has also been adapted into a German-language musical, &quot;Rebecca&quot;, which opened in Vienna in 2006 and ran for three years.

===Opera===
&quot;Rebecca&quot; was adapted as an opera with music by Wilfred Josephs, premiered by Opera North in Leeds, England, 15 October 1983.

==Sequels and related works==
The novel has inspired three additional books approved by the du Maurier estate:
* &quot;Mrs de Winter&quot; (1993) by Susan Hill. ()
* &quot;The Other Rebecca&quot; (1996) by Maureen Freely. ()
* &quot;Rebecca&#x27;s Tale&quot; (2001) by Sally Beauman ()
In addition, a number of fan fiction websites feature sequels, prequels, and adaptations of this novel.

==As a code key in World War II==
One edition of the book was used by the Germans in World War II as the key to a book code. Sentences would be made using single words in the book, referred to by page number, line and position in the line. One copy was kept at Rommel&#x27;s headquarters, and the other was carried by German Abwehr agents infiltrated into Cairo after crossing Egypt by car, guided by Count László Almásy. This code never was used, however, because the radio section of the headquarters was captured in a skirmish and hence the Germans suspected that the code was compromised.

This use of the book is referred to in Ken Follett&#x27;s novel &quot;The Key to Rebecca&quot;—where a (fictional) spy does use it to pass critical information to Rommel. This use was also referenced in Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;The English Patient&quot;.

==Notable cultural references==
===Literature===
The character of Mrs Danvers is alluded to numerous times throughout Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;. In the book, Mrs Danvers serves as something of a bogeyman for the main character Mike Noonan.

In Jasper Fforde&#x27;s &quot;Thursday Next&quot; series, thousands of Mrs Danvers clones are created.

===Television===

The 1970 Parallel Time storyline of the Gothic soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; was heavily inspired by &quot;Rebecca&quot; including the costume ball scene. The second &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; motion picture &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot; also took inspiration from the novel.

The film was parodied on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; in a 1972 skit called &quot;Rebecky&quot;, with Carol Burnett as the heroine, Daphne; Harvey Korman as Max &quot;de Wintry&quot; and in the guise of Mother Marcus as Rebecky de Wintry; and Vicki Lawrence as Mrs Dampers.

Another parody of the story is found in the second series of the sketch show &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot; from 2008. The sketch, which stars Robert Webb as Maxim, David Mitchell as Mrs Danvers, and Jo Neary as Rebecca, explores an alternate approach to a filmatization of the novel. Here, the story is narrated by Rebecca, who is haunted by the household&#x27;s anticipation of a second Mrs De Winter.

The plots of some Latin-American soap operas have also been inspired by the novel, such as &quot;Manuela&quot; (Argentina), &quot;Infierno en el paraíso&quot; (Mexico), the Venezuelan telenovela &quot;Julia&quot; and its remake &quot;El Fantasma de Elena&quot; on Telemundo, and &quot;La Sombra de Belinda&quot; a telenovela from Puerto Rico.

===Music===
Meg &amp; Dia&#x27;s Meg Frampton penned a song titled &quot;Rebecca&quot;, inspired by the novel.

Kansas alumnus Steve Walsh&#x27;s solo recording &quot;Glossolalia&quot; includes a song titled &quot;Rebecca&quot; with the lyrics: &quot;I suppose I was the lucky one, returning like a wayward son to Manderley, I&#x27;d never be the same...&quot;

Steve Hackett included a song titled &quot;Rebecca&quot; on his album &quot;To Watch the Storms&quot;.

Taylor Swift&#x27;s song &quot;Tolerate It&quot;, featured on her album &quot;Evermore&quot;, is inspired by the novel.

===Fashion===
In 2013, Devon watchmakers Du Maurier Watches, founded by the grandson of Daphne du Maurier, released a limited edition collection of two watches inspired by the characters from the novel—The Rebecca and The Maxim.

<text>Immer heiterer (&#x27;More and More Cheerful&#x27;) op. 235 is a waltz written by Johann Strauss II in 1860 for the Vienna Carnival Fasching. The waltz was marked as &quot;im ländlerstil&quot; which meant that it was to be performed in the same style as the ländler.

The work was first performed at the genial &#x27;Strauss Ball&#x27; in the famous &#x27;Sperl&#x27; ballroom in Vienna&#x27;s Leopoldstadt and was popular when first performed although its &#x27;twin&#x27; work, which is the compelling Accelerationen op. 234 won much acclaim.

The most significant section of the waltz can be heard in the coda (tail-piece) where Strauss called for the members of the orchestra to give a chorus of laughter in spirit of the work.

<text>Tyskie () is a Polish brand of beer. Its name comes from the brewery located in Tychy. In modern day, it is brewed by the Grolsche Bierbrouwerij in the Netherlands, part of the Asahi Group Holdings which added the Tyskie brand to its world wide holdings in 2017.

==Beers==
The main brands are Tyskie Gronie (pale lager).

==History==
The brewery is one of the oldest in Europe. Beer has been produced in Tychy continuously for almost 400 years. From 1629, the brewery, then known in German as the &quot;Fürstliche Brauerei Tichau&quot; (Princely Brewery Tychy), was in the ownership of the noble . From 1861, the brewery became known as the &quot;Fürstliche Brauerei in Tichau&quot; (Princely Brewery in Tychy) and came under the management of from the German princely (German &quot;Fürsten&quot;) House of Pless. Between 1918 and 1939, the brewery merged with neighbouring competing companies, but came under provisional administration of the Polish state intermittently from 1934 due to unpaid taxes. During World War II, the brewery was put under the management of the occupying authorities.

==Types of beer produced==
In its beginnings, the brewery produced three kinds of beer: mailings, yeast and tableware. Only the high quality beer was intended for sale, and the other two were a beer allowance drunk mainly by brewers and their families. In the early nineteenth century the brewery produced only two beverages: beer and Bavarian malt, both top-fermenting. Bavarian malt with a classical composition, saturated color was brown, sweet, and low-hopped. The standard favorite was the dark niskoekstraktowe, weak and only for immediate consumption. After the expansion of the brewery in the nineteenth century and the introduction of bottom-fermenting, they started to produce Tyskie lager, a relatively short Bavarian beer. The first beers were light and were sold under the Książęce brand. In the interwar period, popular brands from Tyskie were the Książęce Tyskie Pilsen (Princely Tychy Pilsner), the Książęce Tyskie Export, the Książęce Tyskie Beer full, and Tyskie Porter.

==Export==
Tyskie is one of the leading brands of beer in Poland, with around 18% of the Polish market. Tyskie also has a large export distribution through its parent company. The main export brands are Tyskie Gronie, a 5.0% pale lager Tyskie Gronie is 5.2% ABV in produced by Tychy Brewery Princely.
Tyskie Gronie (abv 5.0%) is also brewed and canned by the Grolsche brewery in Enschede, Netherlands, for the UK market (imported by Asahi UK Ltd).

==Marketing==
Tyskie bottles are known for their distinctive white packaging. The label depicts a royal crown to commemorate John III Sobieski king of Poland, who was born in 1629, the same year the family von Promnitz established a brewery in the town of Tychy.

==Tourism==
In 2004, the Tyskie Brewing Museum was founded on the brewery premises in Tychy. The Tyskie Brewing Museum represents an important &quot;anchor point&quot; of the European Route of Industrial Heritage in Poland.

==Honors==

In 2002, Tyskie Gronie won The Brewing Industry International Awards, receiving the two most prestigious awards - Gold Medal and Grand Prix.

In 2005 in Munich at a global beer fair hosted by Drink Tec, Tyskie again received the Grand Prix.

In 2011 Tyskie received the Gold Medal du Monde Selection – International Institute for Quality Selections.

<text>David Newton Eagleson (October 4, 1924 – May 23, 2003) was an American lawyer who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of California from 1987 to 1991.

==Biography==
Eagleson was born in Los Angeles, California, and educated in the public schools. After serving in World War II, Eagleson earned his law degree from the USC Law School in 1950. On June 6, 1951, he was admitted to the State Bar of California. Eagleson then practiced law in Long Beach, California for 20 years.

In December 1970, Governor Ronald Reagan appointed Eagleson to the Los Angeles County Superior Court, where from 1980 to 1981 he served as presiding judge. From 1979 to 1980, he was president of the California Judges Association. In November 1981, Governor George Deukmejian named Eagleson as an associate justice to the Court of Appeal, Second District, Division Five.

In March 1987, Governor Deukmejian appointed Eagleson as an associate justice to the Supreme Court. A conservative Republican, Eagleson was elevated to the high court after voters removed liberal Chief Justice Rose Bird and two of her allies from the Court in the 1986 general election as a result of the trio&#x27;s opposition to capital punishment. Eagleson tended to uphold capital sentences. During his four years on the court, Eagleson wrote 54 majority opinions. Among Eagleson&#x27;s notable opinions is &quot;Thing v. La Chusa&quot; (1989), which sharply limited the availability of the cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress in California.

After stepping down from the high court, Eagleson practiced as a mediator and arbitrator in Los Angeles.

==Personal life==
On May 16, 1953, Eagleson married Virginia Mae Brown, and they had two daughters, Elizabeth K. Eagleson, an attorney, and Victoria Eagleson, who both reside in Southern California. Beth, in her eulogy for her father delivered before the court on which he once served, cited &quot;Thing&quot; as the opinion most representative of her father&#x27;s voice and philosophy:

<doc id="1259785" wikidata="Q204212" url="?curid=1259785" title="Rebecca (1940 film)">
<text>Rebecca is a 1940 American romantic psychological thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It was Hitchcock&#x27;s first American project, and his first film under contract with producer David O. Selznick. The screenplay by Robert E. Sherwood and Joan Harrison, and adaptation by Philip MacDonald and Michael Hogan, were based on the 1938 novel of the same name by Daphne du Maurier.

The film stars Laurence Olivier as the brooding, aristocratic widower Maxim de Winter and Joan Fontaine as the young, never-named woman who becomes his second wife, with Judith Anderson, George Sanders and Gladys Cooper in supporting roles. The film is a gothic tale shot in black-and-white. Maxim de Winter&#x27;s first wife Rebecca, who died before the events of the film, is never seen. Her reputation and recollections of her, however, are a constant presence in the lives of Maxim, his new wife and the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.

&quot;Rebecca&quot; was theatrically released on April 12, 1940, to critical and commercial success. It received eleven nominations at the 13th Academy Awards, more than any other film that year. It won two awards; Best Picture, and Best Cinematography, becoming the only film directed by Hitchcock to win the former award. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

On the French Riviera, Maxim de Winter stands at a cliff edge, seemingly contemplating suicide. A young woman shouts at him to stop him in his tracks, but he curtly asks her to walk on.

Later, at a Monte Carlo hotel, the same young woman, serving as a paid companion to the pompous aging Mrs. Van Hopper, again encounters the debonair widower de Winter. Aspiring to social prominence, Mrs. Van Hopper is obsequious to the aristocratic de Winter, but is soon confined to her room due to illness. Maxim invites the companion on excursions, which she conceals from her employer as tennis lessons, and the young woman soon becomes infatuated, though puzzled by such attention. On her recovery, Mrs. Van Hopper decides to leave Monte Carlo; her companion furtively informs Maxim of her departure, and Maxim unexpectedly proposes marriage. After being informed of the proposal by Maxim, a shocked Mrs. Van Hopper privately tells her companion that Maxim is marrying her as a desperate distraction because he is still tormented by thoughts of his beloved dead wife, Rebecca. She asserts that her companion is ill-prepared to be the second Mrs. de Winter and cannot hope to succeed as the mistress of the stately Manderley.

Maxim brings his new bride back to Manderley, his grand mansion by the sea in Cornwall. Manderley is dominated by its austere housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, a cold and unyielding woman who had once been a confidante of the first Mrs. de Winter. Danvers harbors a deep resentment for the new Mrs. de Winter, whom she views as a usurper. Danvers feeds the bride&#x27;s insecurity by showing her Rebecca&#x27;s grand bedroom suite, left untouched and off-limits to the new wife, and by retaining items throughout the house that carry Rebecca&#x27;s monogram.

Eventually, constant reminders of Rebecca&#x27;s glamour and sophistication convince the new Mrs. de Winter that Maxim is still in love with his tragically drowned first wife, which could explain his restlessness and irrational outbursts of anger. She tries to assert her new role by holding a costume party as Maxim and Rebecca had done annually. Danvers suggests she copy the dress that one of Maxim&#x27;s ancestors is seen wearing in a portrait. However, when she appears in the costume, Maxim is appalled as Rebecca had worn an identical dress at her last ball, just before her death.

When Mrs. de Winter confronts Danvers about this, Danvers tells her she can never take Rebecca&#x27;s place and tries to persuade her to jump to her death from the second-story window of Rebecca&#x27;s room. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a ship has run aground due to the fog and, during the rescue of its crew, a sunken boat with Rebecca&#x27;s body in it has been discovered.

Maxim now confesses to his new wife that his first marriage had been a sham from the start. Rebecca had declared that she had no intention of keeping to her vows but would pretend to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. When Rebecca implied she was pregnant by her cousin and lover, Jack Favell, she taunted Maxim that the estate might pass to someone other than Maxim&#x27;s line. During a heated argument, Rebecca fell, struck her head, and died. Afraid he would be blamed for her death, Maxim took the body out in a boat which he then scuttled; some days later, he identified another body that washed ashore as Rebecca&#x27;s.

The crisis causes the second Mrs. de Winter to shed her naïve ways. When the inquest considers the possibility of suicide, Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim, threatening to reveal a letter from Rebecca hinting at a pregnancy that made suicide improbable. When Maxim informs the police of the attempted blackmail, they must investigate Favell&#x27;s accusations that Maxim murdered Rebecca. Further investigation with a doctor, however, reveals that Rebecca was not pregnant but terminally ill due to cancer, so the suicide verdict stands. Maxim realizes Rebecca had been trying to goad him into killing her to ruin him.

As a free man, Maxim returns home to see Manderley on fire, set ablaze by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. All escape except Danvers, who dies when the ceiling collapses on her.

==Cast==
Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo appearance, a signature feature of his films, takes place near the end; he is seen walking, back turned to the audience, outside a phone box just after Jack Favell completes a call.

==Preproduction==
In 1938, Hitchcock read the galley proofs of &quot;Rebecca&quot; whilst filming &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, an adaptation of another Daphne du Maurier novel. Hitchcock considered independently purchasing the film rights, but was unable to match the high amounts offered by major studios. The high projected sales figures for the novel made &quot;Rebecca&quot; a highly desirable property, and the rights ultimately went to Selznick International for $50,000 - the same price Selznick had paid for Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Selznick officially assigned Hitchcock to direct the adaptation in September 1938.

Hitchcock and David O. Selznick clashed over the adaptation of &quot;Rebecca&quot;, with Selznick favouring fidelity to the novel while Hitchcock wished to make changes, particularly hoping to add some dynamism to the character of the second Mrs. de Winter.

Selznick first offered the job of writing the screenplay to Daphne du Maurier, but she declined. Selznick unsuccessfully pitched a number of writers to Hitchcock to script &quot;Rebecca&quot; including Clemence Dane, John Balderston, Ben Hecht, and Hugh Walpole. By November 1938, Selznick eventually agreed to pay Hitchcock $5,000 to write an initial outline. Hitchcock worked with his wife, Alma Hitchcock, assistant Joan Harrison, and British writer Michael Hogan to produce a 45-page double-spaced &quot;storyline&quot; which he submitted to Selznick on 3 June 1939. Selznick responded with a lengthy memo, describing himself as &quot;shocked beyond words&quot; and criticizing the ways in which the treatment diverged from the source material. Of the unnamed protagonist, Selznick wrote:

Every little thing that the girl does in the book, her reactions of running away from the guests, and the tiny things that indicate her nervousness and her self-consciousness and her gaucherie are all so brilliant in the book that every woman who has read it has adored the girl and has understood her psychology... We have removed all the subtleties and substituted big broad strokes.

In response to Selznick&#x27;s notes, Hitchcock, with Joan Harrison and Scottish writer Philip MacDonald, began work on a new treatment which hewed closer to du Maurier&#x27;s novel. A first script was completed on 29 July 1939. In the final weeks before shooting was to begin, Selznick hired Robert E. Sherwood to make some final revisions to the script and rework the story&#x27;s climax, paying him $15,000. A final shooting script was dated September 7. Charles Bennett, who was in close contact with Hitchcock and Selznick at the time they were working on &quot;Rebecca&quot;, stated that the final script was &quot;ninety percent the work of Michael Hogan, although some rewrites were done by Joan. Very little, at the end, was contributed by the one who is most famous and therefore most credited, Sherwood&quot;.

Although Selznick insisted that the film be faithful to the novel, Hitchcock did make some other changes, though not as many as he had made in a previously rejected screenplay, in which he altered virtually the entire story. In the novel, Mrs. Danvers is something of a jealous mother figure, and her past is mentioned in the book. In the film, Mrs. Danvers is a much younger character (Judith Anderson would have been about 42 at the time of shooting), and her past is not revealed at all. The only thing known about her in the film is that she came to Manderley when Rebecca was a bride.

===Casting===
The process of casting &quot;Rebecca&quot; occurred in parallel with the development of the screenplay over the course of several months leading up to the beginning of shooting in September 1939.

For the role of Maxim de Winter, Selznick and Hitchcock originally sought Ronald Colman, whom Selznick had under contract. Colman declined the role over concerns that the film would be a &quot;woman-starring vehicle&quot; and over the &quot;murder angle&quot;. Selznick subsequently pitched actors Melvyn Douglas, Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Howard, and William Powell, before he and Hitchcock ultimately settled on English actor Laurence Olivier.

The casting of the second Mrs. de Winter was contentious and no fewer than 126 actresses, ranging from major stars to unknowns, were considered for the role. Relative newcomer Joan Fontaine was ultimately selected less than two weeks before the start of principal photography. Selznick initially argued for English actress Nova Pilbeam, having been impressed by her performance in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Young and Innocent&quot; (1937). Hitchcock rejected her, arguing that while she was &quot;correct casting according [to the] book&quot;, she was not appropriate for his vision of the character. Laurence Olivier unsuccessfully advocated for the role to go to his lover (and later wife) Vivien Leigh. Among the actresses Hitchcock tested for the role were Lucile Fairbanks, Marjorie Reynolds, and Jean Muir. By August 19, the list of finalists for the role had been narrowed to Margaret Sullavan, Anne Baxter, Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine. Selznick ultimately offered the role to Fontaine, announcing her casting on 5 September 1939, just three days before filming was to begin.

Australian stage actress Judith Anderson was cast in the role of Mrs. Danvers at the suggestion of Kay Brown of Selznick International. As a condition of auditioning, Anderson insisted that Hitchcock personally direct her screen test. Other actresses who had been considered for the role included Flora Robson, Elsa Lanchester, and Alla Nazimova.

Lucile Watson, Laura Hope Crews, Mary Boland, Alice Brady, and Cora Witherspoon were considered for the minor role of Mrs. van Hopper, the protagonist&#x27;s social-climbing employer in the beginning of the story. Hitchcock ultimately selected Florence Bates for the role after seeing her in a theatrical production at the Pasadena Playhouse. Bates, a lawyer by training who had only appeared on camera once before, required an unusually large number of retakes for some of her scenes. Selznick was displeased with her line readings, stating &quot;I think there is no line which she could not improve on&quot;.

==Censorship==
Before Selznick purchased the rights to &quot;Rebecca&quot;, he submitted a synopsis of the novel to the Production Code office, an industry body administered by Joseph Breen which strictly policed the morality of films released by major US studios. In the final act of the novel, Maxim de Winter confesses to the narrator that he shot Rebecca to death after she taunted him with her infidelities and claimed to be pregnant with another man&#x27;s child. The discovery of Rebecca&#x27;s body triggers an inquest into her death. Maxim avoids being charged, despite Jack Favell, Rebecca&#x27;s cousin and lover, suspecting his guilt and directing the police to investigate him. The Production Code office described this as &quot;a clear violation of the Production Code, since it apparently justifies and condones murder&quot;.

Selznick proceeded with the adaptation despite this warning. Breen&#x27;s office rejected an initial script, outlining three chief issues (along with a long list of objectionable phrases to be excised such as &quot;for God&#x27;s sake&quot;, &quot;you ass&quot; and &quot;lovers&quot;):
1. As now written, it is the story of a murderer, who is permitted to go off &quot;scot free.&quot;

2. The quite inescapable inference of sex perversion.

3. The repeated references, in the dialogue, to the alleged illicit relationship between Favell and the first Mrs. de Winter, and the frequent references to the alleged illegitimate child-to-be.

To remedy the first issue, Breen demanded that either de Winter be punished for his crime, or that Rebecca&#x27;s death be rewritten to be accidental. The latter solution, which was ultimately adopted, had been first proposed by Hitchcock in a meeting with Breen and his assistant at the Victor Hugo Restaurant. Selznick, a strident critic of the Production Code, was annoyed at having to make this concession, complaining that &quot;the whole story of &quot;Rebecca&quot; is of a man who has murdered his wife, and it now becomes the story of a man who buried a wife who was killed accidentally!&quot;

The &quot;sex perversion&quot; mentioned in the second point was in reference to the implied lesbian attraction felt by Mrs. Danvers toward Rebecca. Breen complained of the impropriety of &quot;Mrs. Danvers&#x27; description of Rebecca&#x27;s physical attributes, [and] her handling of the various garments, particularly the night gown&quot;. Breen insisted that in the final cut &quot;there must be no suggestion whatever of a perverted relationship between Mrs. Danvers and Rebecca.&quot; Scholar David Boyd describes Danvers&#x27; attraction to Rebecca as &quot;inescapably clear to all but the most innocent of viewers&quot; in the present day, though it is unclear whether this interpretation would have been accessible to audiences in 1940. Asked about it later in life, Judith Anderson denied intentionally playing Mrs. Danvers as a lesbian, stating that &quot;we never thought of such things at that time&quot;.

The references to the extramarital affair between Favell and Rebecca de Winter remained explicit in the final cut of the film, as well as Rebecca&#x27;s illegitimate pregnancy, though the character of Dr. Baker, implied in the book to be an abortionist, is portrayed in the film as a respectable physician.

==Production==
Principal photography on Rebecca began on 8 September 1939, having been postponed twice from 30 August and then 5 September. The film was budgeted at $800,000 and 36 days of shooting, but went significantly behind schedule, ultimately concluding after 63 days on 20 November 1939. The start of production coincided with the beginning of World War II, Britain having declared war on Germany on 3 September. Hitchcock and the mostly British cast feared for their families in Britain, with fears circulating that London might soon experience German bombing.

Selznick initially assigned Harry Stradling as cinematographer, but he withdrew from the project after the distressing experience of being fired from &quot;Intermezzo&quot; by Selznick. Selznick sought Gregg Toland as a replacement, but, finding him unavailable, instead hired Toland&#x27;s mentor, George Barnes.

Art director Lyle Wheeler designed 40 sets for &quot;Rebecca&quot;, 25 of them interiors, mostly of Manderley. Matte painting was used to fill out shots of the sets with hand-painted details such as upper walls, ceilings and chandeliers.

Two miniatures of Manderley were created. The larger miniature occupied most of a large stage. It was used for relatively close shots, such as the views of flames through the windows during the burning of Manderley. The size of this miniature made it impossible to position a camera to encompass the full house and grounds, so a smaller version was constructed for long shots. This half-size miniature was used for the opening of the film.

Hitchcock later said that Selznick wanted the smoke from the burning Manderley to spell out a huge &quot;R&quot;, which Hitchcock thought lacked subtlety. While Selznick was preoccupied by &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), Hitchcock was able to replace the smoky &quot;R&quot; with the burning of a monogrammed négligée case lying atop a bed pillow. Hitchcock edited the film &quot;in camera&quot; (shooting only what he wanted to see in the final film) to restrict the producer&#x27;s power to re-edit the picture. But Selznick relished the post-production process; he personally edited the footage, laid in Franz Waxman&#x27;s score, and supervised retakes and extensive re-recording of the dialogue of Sanders, Bates and Fontaine. Rewrites and reshooting were called for after a rough cut was previewed on December 26, 1939.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported in 1944 that Edwina Levin MacDonald sued Selznick, Daphne du Maurier, United Artists and Doubleday for plagiarism. MacDonald claimed that the film &quot;Rebecca&quot; was stolen from her novel &quot;Blind Windows&quot;, and sought an undisclosed amount of accounting and damages. The complaint was dismissed on January 14, 1948 and the judgment can be read online.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film earned $3 million in theater rentals from the U.S. and Canada and $1 million in Britain on its initial release. It was re-released in Britain in 1945 and made $460,000.

According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot;, it was the most popular film of 1940 in Britain.

==Reception==

When it premiered at the Radio City Music Hall, Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an altogether brilliant film, haunting, suspenseful, handsome and handsomely played&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an artistic success&quot; but warned it was &quot;too tragic and deeply psychological to hit the fancy of wide audience appeal&quot;. &quot;Film Daily&quot; wrote: &quot;Here is a picture that has the mark of quality in every department - production, direction, acting, writing and photography - and should have special appeal to femme fans. It creates a new star in Joan Fontaine, who does fine work in a difficult role, while Laurence Olivier is splendid.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; declared: &quot;A powerful psychological drama for adults. David O. Selznick has given it a superb production, and Alfred Hitchcock has again displayed his directorial skill in building up situations that thrill and hold the spectator in tense suspense.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Hitchcock &quot;labored hard to capture every tragic or ominous nuance, and presents a romance which is, I think, even more stirring than the novel&quot;. Leslie Halliwell gave &quot;Rebecca&quot; four of four stars, stating: &quot;The supreme Hollywood entertainment package...with generous helpings of romance, comedy, suspense, melodrama and mystery...&quot; Pauline Kael called it &quot;Magnificent romantic-gothic corn, full of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s humor and inventiveness.&quot;

The film holds a 98% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 104 reviews, with an average rating of 8.90/10. The site&#x27;s consensus describes it as &quot;a masterpiece of haunting atmosphere, Gothic thrills, and gripping suspense&quot;. On Metacritic it has a score of 86 out of 100, based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;Rebecca&quot; won the &quot;Film Daily&quot; year-end poll of 546 critics nationwide naming the best films of 1940.
&quot;Rebecca&quot; was the opening film at the 1st Berlin International Film Festival in 1951. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;one of Hitchcock&#x27;s creepiest, most oppressive films&quot;. In a poll held by the &quot;Empire&quot; magazine in 2008, it was voted 318th &#x27;Greatest Movie of All Time&#x27; from a list of 500. In 2016, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked the film at No. 23 on their list of &quot;The 100 best British films&quot; because although it was an American production the film was set in England and mainly starred English actors and actresses. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. A restored nitrate print of &quot;Rebecca&quot; was shown at the Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood in 2019. The screening was introduced by Christopher Nolan.

===Accolades===
&quot;Rebecca&quot; won two Academy Awards: Best Picture and Best Cinematography; and was nominated for nine more: It is the only film since 1936 (when awards for actors in supporting roles were first introduced) that, despite winning Best Picture, received no Academy Award for acting, directing or writing.

&quot;Rebecca&quot; was twice honored by the AFI in their AFI 100 Years... series
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills 80
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains Mrs. Danvers, No. 31 Villain

<text>The Acadian World Congress, or Le Congrès Mondial Acadien, is a festival of Acadian and Cajun culture and history, held every five years. It is also informally known as the &quot;Acadian Reunion&quot;. Its creator was André Boudreau (1945-2005).

==History==

An earlier series of Acadian national conventions (:fr:) occurred from 1881 to 1979 in the Atlantic Canada region of Acadia.

===1994 World Congress===
The first World Congress took place from August 12, 1994 to August 22, 1994 in Moncton and in nine other communities in southeastern New Brunswick, including, Bouctouche, Shediac, Saint-Joseph, Richibucto, Cap-Pelé, Dieppe, New Brunswick, Saint-Antoine, Rogersville, Saint-Louis-de-Kent and Saint Thomas. Conferences, shows and family reunions were on the program. The number of participants was estimated at more than 200,000.

The official opening ceremony took place on August 13, 1994 at Aboiteau Beach in Cap-Pelé, in the presence of Jean Chrétien, the Prime Minister of Canada, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary General of the UN, Frank McKenna, Premier of New Brunswick, Alfred Siefer-Gaillardin, Ambassador of France to Canada, Claude Ryan, Minister of Municipal Affairs of Quebec and Antonine Maillet, writer.

The song, &quot;Sommet des femmes en Acadie&quot; was organized by the Fédération des Dames d&#x27;Acadia. The 1994 Acadian World Congress was recognized by UNESCO as an activity of the World Decade for Cultural Development (1988-1997). The president and founder of this first congress was André Boudreau, native of Nigadoo, New Brunswick.

===1999 World Congress===
The second congress was held from July 31, 1999 to August 15, 1999 in several parishes in Louisiana, including, Terrebonne, Lafayette, East Baton Rouge. The 1999 event featured the reunions of over 80 Acadian families, three major concerts (Houma, Oak Alley Plantation, and Lafayette Cajundome), and academic conferences centered on economics, culture, women&#x27;s issues, genealogy and genetics. The President and executive director of the 1999 event was Brian Gabriel Comeaux of Lafayette, Louisiana.

===2004 World Congress===
The third Congress took place from July 31, 2004 to August 15, 2004 in several Nova Scotia regions in the ancestral Acadia region including Clare, Chéticamp, Grand-Pré, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Congress took place during the 400th anniversary of Acadia, for which there was also a program during the year. The theme song was &quot;Je reviens au Berceau de l&#x27;Acadie&quot; by Grand Dérangement and Carole Daigle.

The Official Opening took place on July 31 at Université Sainte-Anne and was centered around the theme of the return to ancestral lands. It was followed by cooking parties in halls throughout the southwest of the province. The program included conferences, family gatherings, a &quot;festival of festivals&quot;, and a mass. The August 15th mega-show took place on the Halifax Citadel, a place of imprisonment during the deportation of the Acadians.

The Congress President was Allister Surette and the Executive Director was Vaughne Madden.

<doc id="1259801" wikidata="Q3100073" url="?curid=1259801" title="Geek Squad">
<text>Geek Squad, Inc. is a subsidiary of American and Canadian multinational consumer electronics corporation Best Buy, headquartered in Richfield, Minnesota. The subsidiary was originally an independent company founded by &quot;Chief Inspector&quot; Robert Stephens on June 16, 1994, and offers various computer-related services and accessories for residential and commercial clients. In 2002, they merged with Best Buy, retaining Stephens as the primary corporate leadership for the subsidiary. The Geek Squad provides services in-store, on-site, and over the Internet via remote access, and also provides 24-hour telephone and emergency on-site support. Geek Squad no longer works solely on computer-related devices. It now diagnoses issues in and repairs all consumer electronics, as well as appliances.

==Locations and partnerships==

Geek Squad precincts exist in most Best Buy stores in the United States (incl. Puerto Rico) and Canada. They offer in-store, in-home, online, and remote/over the phone services.

Best Buy terminated its partnership with Office Depot in Orlando, Florida, where Geek Squad precincts were located in ten Office Depot locations. The brand is also located in select FedEx Office locations.

In October 2006, Best Buy was reported that Geek Squad would be launching in the United Kingdom in a joint 50-50 venture with Carphone Warehouse, where today it exists as both an onsite service and a remote repair service, although not under the same name. At its peak, Geek Squad services were available in Greater London, the Home Counties, the South Coast and North West areas of England, with phone and remote support was undertaken from Tulketh Mill in Preston (Lancashire) and repairs completed at a site in Wednesbury (West Midlands). In November 2015 Geek Squad repairs moved to Newark following the merger between Carphone Warehouse and Dixons Retail forming Dixons Carphone (now Currys PLC).

In 2008, Best Buy partnered with online tech support provider SupportSpace to offer remote Virtual Agent services to its clients. SupportSpace was founded in 2006 and provided immediate online tech support services. On July 15, 2013, all Geek Squad business was transferred away from SupportSpace and moved in-house to Geek Squad agents.

In January 2012, following poor financial results, the Best Buy Europe venture was discontinued with Carphone Warehouse purchasing its 50% of the deal back. In the following years the Geek Squad operations in France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain and Portugal were slowly wound down with the brand finally ending in Europe with Carphone Warehouse adopting the Team Knowhow brand in 2017.

A 2013 agreement with Atomic Learning, Inc. provides all Geek Squad tech subscribers with access to over 60,000 on-demand tutorial training videos.

===Total Services===
In 2007, Geek Squad officially added Magnolia Home Theater installation teams as well as Best Buy Mobile Installers to the Geek Squad brand. The change was titled, &quot;Total Services&quot; and was aimed towards the combination of major Best Buy services into one cohesive unit. Best Buy mobile installers and Magnolia Home Theater installers have now switched from their previous grey and blue uniforms to grey and orange shirts with grey cargo pants. This change removed all &quot;Magnolia Home Theater Installation&quot; branding and was replaced by &quot;Geek Squad Installation Units&quot; instead. This has now allowed Geek Squad to incorporate home theater installation as one of the in home services offered via telephone. Geek Squad is also now an Apple Authorized Service Provider.

==Staff==

Geek Squad employees are known as Agents and are assigned titles similar to those used by intelligence agencies – Counter Intelligence Agent (CIA), Deputy of Counter Intelligence (DCI), Double Agent-Covert (DAC), Covert Agent (CA), Special Agent (SA), Deputy Covert Operations (DCO) and Deputy Field Marshal (DFM), to name a few. Unlike most computer repair facilities, Best Buy US does not require any industry certifications for its in-store technicians. However, Best Buy Canada requires at least A+ Certification to work as a CIA. They also require MECP certification for all technical mobile electronics installers. In-Store positions have long since changed, now only consisting of Consultation Agent (CA), Advanced Repair Agent (ARA), Geek Squad Sr (CIA Sr), Services Experience Supervisor, and Services Experience Manager.

===Uniforms and vehicles===


In-store PC agents, and in-home PC field agents, wear a white, short-sleeved, pocketless dress shirt. Agents are required to wear a black clip-on tie with the Geek Squad logo pin. Male agents wear black trousers, white socks and black lace-up shoes that used to have the Geek Squad logo on the sole. Female agents may wear either black trousers, white socks, and black shoes; or, a black skirt with hose and black shoes. White and black are the only colors allowed in Geek Squad uniforms. Agents who have served in an eligible capacity within any branch of Geek Squad for eighteen months, or who have held certain positions prior to 2014 including on-site Double Agents, Special Agents, and Deputies of Counter Intelligence carry a metal police-style badge with their Agent Number engraved on it. In October 2019 the Dress Code Policy for Best Buy was updated, with this update an alternate uniform option was introduced for Geek Squad Agents allowing them to wear the black Geek Squad polo along with jeans and sneakers.

The branding of the uniform to include a badge is central to the culture for Geek Squad Agents, including the writing of a 40-page essay, &quot;The Geek Squad Badge&quot;, by former/“Sleeper” Double Agent Roman Corrales, Badge #11345. The essay explores history of badges across history, connecting the Roman shield to their evolution into the modern badge worn by many professionals today. The essay has been integrated across much of Geek Squad&#x27;s employee branding, including being cited in an internal culture manual known as the Little Orange Book. 

The Minnesota Historical Society added the official uniform to its permanent collection in 2000.

Geek Squad Autotechs and GSIs (Home Theater Installers) wear a grey button-up work shirt or black short sleeved and collared dress shirt with the Geek Squad logo on the front and optional certification patches on the arms. Matching pants or shorts are worn as well as a bright orange undershirt. These agents also have the option of wearing a grey Geek Squad hat and/or black Geeks Squad nylon jacket.

Prior to 2016, Double Agents and Special Agents drove black-and-white Volkswagen New Beetles (dubbed &quot;Geekmobiles&quot;) with an orange-and-black company logo on the door. Geekmobiles in California are all-black with white roof and running boards due to a request by the California Highway Patrol that the vehicles no longer resemble the paint scheme of their police vehicles (a violation of California law). In 2016, Geek Squad began phasing out the New Beetles and replacing them with Toyota Prius Cs.

The Double Agent program in the UK ceased in late 2012. All technical support services continued in store or via Mission Control, Tulketh Mill. From here, the Covert or Covert Operations Agent title was established, Agents from Covert Operations are responsible for the technical support of desktop or laptop devices. They provide support for a narrow range of approved issues verbally over the phone, or Agents will connect to clients devices remotely and fix any issues if the computer is able to connect to the internet.

Geek Squad Agents that leave their roles, are referred to internally, as “Sleeper Agents”- a common quote when saying farewell to an Agent going sleeper is “await the signal”, as a reference to the Bat-Signal from Batman, used to call the superhero in a time of need. The idea is that Geek Squad has always been known to be welcoming of former Agents looking to return for a job, and to wish them luck in their endeavors.

==Geek Squad City==
Located in Brooks, Kentucky, Geek Squad City is the largest Geek Squad computer repair site at 240,000 square feet.

==Controversy==
Geek Squad technicians have been caught on numerous occasions searching and copying pornographic content stored on their clients&#x27; computers without permission. When asked about the incident, Geek Squad founder Robert Stephens refused to discuss the topic and focused on whether bloggers should be considered true journalists.

At least one former Geek Squad employee had come forward with allegations that the practice of surreptitiously searching for pornography on their clients&#x27; computers is not restricted to isolated employees, but is often shared with management.

In 2002, during a spate of legal threats and challenges to competitors with &quot;geek&quot; in their names, Geek Squad attempted to block the trademark registration of New England area competitor Geek Housecalls claiming that it violated their trademarks. When Geek Housecalls refused to budge, Geek Squad filed civil suit. After two years of wrangling, Geek Squad and Geek Housecalls arrived at an out-of-court settlement, the details of which cannot be disclosed according to the terms of the settlement except to state that Geek Housecalls retained its name.

In 2006, Geek Squad was sued for allegedly using unauthorized copies of Winternals&#x27; Emergency Repair Disk Commander. The lawsuit filed by Austin-based Winternals claims that employees of Geek Squad have continued using the unlicensed versions of the software after the commercial licensing agreement broke off. Best Buy and Geek Squad were accused of copyright infringement, circumvention of copyright infringement systems, and misappropriation of trade secrets. A settlement was eventually reached, and Winternals created a three-year agreement in place with Best Buy, allowing Geek Squad employees to lawfully use their licensed programs, including the ERD Commander.

In 2007, Best Buy was hit with a civil lawsuit by Sarah Vasquez alleging that Geek Squad technician Hao Kuo Chi had secretly taped her showering with a cellular phone camera he hid behind her sink. Vasquez sought compensation from Best Buy based on claims of negligent misrepresentation and hiring, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional stress. On top of the civil suit, Hao was also facing criminal charges including two counts of invasion of privacy and one count of child molestation.

In 2010, Best Buy issued a trademark infringement cease and desist letter against a priest in Wisconsin for painting &quot;God Squad&quot; on his car.

In 2013, Geek Squad was sued for invasion of privacy and several other civil infractions for allegedly releasing nude images found on a customer&#x27;s computer. The suit is ongoing. In June 2015, the court denied Best Buy&#x27;s motions for summary judgment on all claims except the claim for &quot;negligence/wantonness.&quot;

On March 7, 2018, NPR reported that &quot;FBI Used Paid Informants On Best Buy&#x27;s Geek Squad To Flag Child Pornography&quot; according to a document that was released by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

<doc id="1259804" wikidata="Q538206" url="?curid=1259804" title="Yvonne Brathwaite Burke">
<text>Yvonne Pearl Burke (née Watson, later Brathwaite; born October 5, 1932) is an American politician and lawyer from California. She was the first African-American woman to represent the West Coast in Congress. She served in the U.S. Congress from 1973–1979. She represented the 2nd District on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors from 1992–2008. She served as Chair of Los Angeles County four times and served as chair pro tem three times.

In 1973, she became the first member of the U.S. Congress to give birth while in office, and she was the first person to be granted maternity leave by the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.

She serves on the Board of Directors of Amtrak, having been appointed to the position by President Barack Obama in 2012.

==Early life and career==

Perle Yvonne Watson was born on October 5, 1932, in Los Angeles as the only child of James A. Watson and the former Lola Moore.

After first attending a public school, she was sent to a model school for exceptional children. At Manual Arts High School she was a member of the debate team and served as vice president of the Latin Club her junior year and girls&#x27; vice president in her senior year.

Burke attended the University of California, Berkeley from c. 1949 to 1951 before receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1953. She subsequently earned a J.D. degree from the University of Southern California Law School in 1956. Burke is one of the first black women to be admitted to the University of Southern California Law School.

Her first entry into the world of politics was when she worked as a volunteer for the reelection of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. She was elected to the California State Assembly in 1966, representing Los Angeles&#x27; 63rd District (1966–1972). Many of her early legislative efforts centered around juvenile issues and limiting garnishment of wages.

She served as vice-chairperson of the 1972 Democratic National Convention. She was the first African American and the first woman of color to hold that position, and presided for about fourteen hours when the chair left the convention on its last day.

That same year, she was elected to the first of three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Tenure in U.S. Congress==
During her tenure in Congress, she served on the House Select Committee on Assassinations, House Beauty Shop Committee, and the House Committee on Appropriations; during her tenure on the Appropriations Committee, she fought for increased funding to aid local jurisdictions to comply with desegregation mandates 

In 1973, with the birth of her daughter Autumn, Burke became the first member of Congress to give birth while in office and the first to be granted maternity leave by the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.

She did not seek re-election to Congress in 1978, but instead ran for Attorney General of California. She lost to Republican George Deukmejian.

==Later political career==
In 1979, shortly after she left Congress, Governor Jerry Brown appointed Burke to the Board of Regents of the University of California; but she resigned later that year when Governor Brown appointed her to fill a vacancy in the District 4 seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Burke was the first female and first African-American supervisor. Her district, however, was largely made up of affluent, conservative white areas on the coast. In 1980, Burke was defeated in her bid for a full term in the seat by Republican Deane Dana. In 1982, Brown again appointed her to the Regents.

In 1992, Burke ran for the District 2 seat on the L.A. County Board of Supervisors. The primary election was held in June, 1992, just weeks after the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. After a hard-fought campaign that often turned negative, Burke narrowly defeated State Senator Diane Watson.

In 2007, Burke announced that she would retire when her term expired in 2008. On July 27, 2007, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published a front-page story revealing that she was not living in the mostly low-income district she represented, but rather in the wealthy Brentwood neighborhood, an apparent violation of state law. Burke responded that she was living at her Brentwood mansion because the townhouse she listed in official political filings was being remodeled.

On March 29, 2012, she was nominated by President Barack Obama to serve on the Amtrak Board of Directors. Confirmed by the U.S. Senate, she has held a seat on that board ever since.

==Personal life==
In 1957 she married Louis Brathwaite, divorcing in 1964. She married William A. Burke in Los Angeles on June 14, 1972, just days after she won a Congressional primary against Billy Mills, a Los Angeles City Council member for whom William Burke had worked. William Burke is also the creator of the Los Angeles Marathon. Their daughter Autumn Burke was born on November 23, 1973. Yvonne and Autumn are the first mother-and-daughter to both serve in the California Assembly.

== Memberships ==
Burke is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.

Burke is a Fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

<text>Mike Dringenberg (born ) is an American comics artist best known for his work on DC Comics/Vertigo&#x27;s &quot;Sandman&quot; series with writer Neil Gaiman.

==Early life==
Mike Dringenberg was born in Laon, France and raised in Germany before moving to the United States with his family in the late 1960s. Initially living in New Jersey and Florida, his father&#x27;s career eventually took the family to Utah, where Mike attended high school. He later studied illustration and graphic design at the University of Utah from 1983 to 1987, where he began illustrating comics and working professionally even before graduating. During a break between his freshman and sophomore years, he briefly worked as an animation assistant at Sullivan Bluth Studios, where he was probably best remembered for using up all the copier toner to make reading copies of his Cerebus collection. 

==Career==
Dringenberg&#x27;s first work in the comics industry was the story &quot;A Tale Of... Lenny&#x27;s Casino &amp; Grill&quot; in &quot;Kelvin Mace&quot; #1 (Dec. 1985) published by Vortex Comics. His other early work in the 1980s for publishers such as Eclipse Comics included &quot;Alien Worlds&quot;, &quot;Enchanter&quot;, and &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;. He worked on &quot;Adolescent Radioactive Blackbelt Hamsters&quot;, a parody of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, which itself was a parody of many then-current comic books, and &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot;. His mainstream work includes DC&#x27;s &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; with writer Grant Morrison, where he co-created Flex Mentallo; the fantasy card game &quot;&quot;; and White Wolf Publishing&#x27;s card game &quot;&quot;.
Dringenberg came to prominence for his work on &quot;The Sandman&quot;, where he started as the series&#x27; inker over pencil art by Sam Kieth but switched to pencilling when Kieth left after the fifth issue. He drew eleven issues, all but one inked by Malcolm Jones III, and his understated, realistic style did much to establish the tone of the series. He co-created the popular character Death, whom he based on his then muse, Cinamon Hadley, whom he knew from the dance clubs in Salt Lake City, Utah. Gaiman had imagined her looking like Louise Brooks or Nico, but ultimately preferred Dringenberg&#x27;s version. Dringenberg stated in a 2014 interview that &quot;None of the characters are direct renderings of individual people; they&#x27;re composites emerging from my memories; case in point, while my friend Cinamon was a primary visual inspiration for Death, she never actually posed for me as the character while I worked on the series. Most of the time, my girlfriend Givette and my friends McAnn and Nyssa actually posed and they each brought their own personalities to the task.&quot; He also co-created Delirium, Despair, and Desire, basing their androgynous appearance on the work of Patrick Nagel, and had a hand in much of the character design apparent in the early series.

Dringenberg&#x27;s work appears in the &quot;Sandman&quot; collections &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot;, &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot; and &quot;Season of Mists&quot;. He is credited in every printing as being one of the series&#x27; creators, as he is responsible for the iconic representation of many of the principal characters. In 2008, he was one of the artists for Tori Amos&#x27; &quot;Comic Book Tattoo&quot; anthology graphic novel.

Dringenberg is an illustrator of book jackets and CD covers, most notably for various books by J. R. R. Tolkien, Kij Johnson, Charles de Lint, Kage Baker. He drew interior illustrations and chapter decorations for Sharyn November&#x27;s &quot;Firebirds Soaring&quot; (2009). Mike has illustrated several album and CD covers for San Francisco&#x27;s Big City Orchestra. He has also contributed artwork for a number of cards, from 1996&#x27;s &quot;Mirage&quot; to 2008&#x27;s &quot;Eventide&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dringenberg lived in Salt Lake City, Utah for many years before moving to the greater Portland, Oregon area, where he currently resides.

<text>Tausend und eine Nacht (Thousand and One Nights), Op. 346, is a waltz composed by Johann Strauss II in 1871. The waltz&#x27;s melodies were drawn from his first operetta, &quot;Indigo und die vierzig Räuber&quot; (&quot;Indigo and the Forty Thieves&quot;). It was his first attempt at ensuring that the more memorable melodies from the stage works would survive obscurity by finding new life as a new orchestral work, a practice which he would retain in future stage works. Such a move would also benefit sheet music publishers who can sell the piano editions of the new works to the public who can readily identify individual music pieces.

The waltz incorporated the more popular numbers from the operetta, with the melody &quot;Ja, so singt man&quot; comprising the entire first waltz section. The second section was contributed from the act 2 bacchanal &quot;Lasst frei nun erschallen das Lied aus der Brust&quot;.

The waltz&#x27;s dreamy introduction is played by a sonorous clarinet evoking a distinctive Arabian feel. The first waltz is robust and energetic, with a trio section of comparatively less-rigorous character. The second waltz is a swirling passage in C major, in a high-spirited fashion. The third waltz is considerably gentler, with a fierce, exciting coda. The first waltz theme makes a hesitant entry again, accelerating into its breathless and brilliant conclusion, with repeated chords, with a strong drumroll and brass flourish.

<text>John Roger Spottiswoode (born 5 January 1945) is a Canadian-British director, editor and writer of film and television.

==Early life==
He was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and was raised in Britain. His father Raymond Spottiswoode was a British film theoretician who worked at the National Film Board of Canada during the 1940s, directing short films such as &quot;Wings of a Continent&quot;.

==Career==
In the 1960s, Spottiswoode entered the British film industry as a trainee editor where he apprenticed under editor John Bloom. In the early 1970s Spottiswoode edited several films for Sam Peckinpah.

He wanted to direct and Walter Hill advised him the best way in was to write a script. Hill and Spottiswoode collaborated on the scripts for &quot;48 Hours&quot; and the never-made &quot;The Last Gun&quot;. 

Spottiswoode turned to directing in the early 1980s and has since directed a number of notable films and television productions, including &quot;Under Fire&quot; (1983) and the 1997 James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; starring Pierce Brosnan. Spottiswoode was a member of the writing team responsible for &quot;48 Hrs.&quot; starring Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte.

<doc id="1259822" wikidata="Q5166311" url="?curid=1259822" title="Convention on the Unification of Certain Points of Substantive Law on Patents for Invention">
<text>The Convention on the Unification of Certain Points of Substantive Law on Patents for Invention, also called Strasbourg Convention or Strasbourg Patent Convention, is a multilateral treaty signed by Member States of the Council of Europe on 27 November 1963 in Strasbourg, France. It entered into force on 1 August 1980, and led to a significant harmonization of patent laws across European countries.

This Convention establishes patentability criteria, i.e. specifies on which grounds inventions can be rejected as not patentable. Its intent was to harmonize substantive patent law but not procedural law. This convention is quite different from the European Patent Convention (EPC), which establishes an independent system for granting European patents.

The Strasbourg Convention has had a significant impact on the EPC, on national patent laws across Europe, on the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), on the Patent Law Treaty (PLT) and on the WTO&#x27;s TRIPS.

== Ratifications and accessions ==
Thirteen countries ratified the treaty or acceded to it: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Republic of Macedonia, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.

<text>Vítězslav Hálek (also known as Vincenc Hálek; ; 5 April 1835 – 8 October 1874) was a Czech poet, writer, journalist, dramatist and theatre critic.

==Life==

Hálek was born in Dolínek, Austrian Empire, today part of Odolena Voda in the Czech Republic. In 1841–1842, he lived in Zálezlice.

After completing his studies at gymnasium in Prague Hálek refused to go on to study at seminary. He didn&#x27;t finish his philosophical studies and instead decided to become a writer. Beginning in 1861, he worked as an editor in &quot;Národní listy&quot;, later helping publish newspapers and journals (&quot;Lumír, Květy&quot; or &quot;Zlatá Praha&quot;, which he founded). He worked as a journalist until his death in Prague in 1874. He died suddenly of pneumonia.

He is considered one of the most important representatives of the May School, along with Jan Neruda.

==Style==
In his time, his writing was very popular, in part due to his optimistic and relaxed writing style.

<text>Once Upon a Mattress is a musical comedy with music by Mary Rodgers, lyrics by Marshall Barer, and book by Jay Thompson, Dean Fuller, and Marshall Barer. It opened off-Broadway in May 1959, and then moved to Broadway. The play was written as a humorous adaptation of the 1835 Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot;.

&quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot; was written as a shorter play at the Tamiment adult summer camp resort. The play was later expanded for the Broadway stage. Initial reviews of the play were mixed, but critics and actors alike were surprised by the show&#x27;s enduring popularity. &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot; is a popular choice produced by high school and university music and drama programs.

==Production history==

=== Broadway (1959-1960) ===
The original production opened on May 11, 1959, at the off-Broadway Phoenix Theatre (later a multi-plex cinema on the Lower East Side), transferred later that year to Broadway at the Alvin Theatre (the modern Neil Simon Theatre) and then to several other Broadway theaters, finally playing at the St. James Theatre, for a total run of 470 performances. The musical was directed by George Abbott and choreographed by Joe Layton. &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot; marked the Broadway debut of comedian Carol Burnett, who originated the role of Princess Winnifred. Also featured were Joseph Bova, Allen Case, Jack Gilford and Matt Mattox. Jane White played the role of Queen Aggravain. Jack Gilford played King Sextimus The Silent and was later replaced by Will Lee, Gilford&#x27;s standby, before the show&#x27;s Broadway move. The musical received a Tony Award nomination for Best Musical as well as a Best Leading Actress nomination for Carol Burnett. When Burnett left the show on June 25, 1960, veteran television actress Ann B. Davis took over the leading role beginning June 27. A few days later the show announced it was closing July 2; Davis played eight performances as Winnifred.

=== US National Tour (1960) ===
In August 1960, soon after the closing of the Broadway run, rehearsals were called for a seven-month US tour which would move from city to city by train, truck and bus. Jack Sydow stepped from his role as King into the position of Director. Dody Goodman played Winnifred at first, then Imogene Coca picked up the role. Carol Arthur understudied them both, and played the Nightingale of Samarkand. Fritzi Burr played the Queen and Buster Keaton played the King. Keaton&#x27;s wife Eleanor was placed in the chorus. Keaton warmed up to the cast of younger actors, freely dispensing grandfatherly advice and chocolates.

=== West End (1960) ===
A London production of the musical opened at the Adelphi Theatre on September 20, 1960, where it ran for 24 performances. The cast included Jane Connell as Winnifred, Robin Hunter as Dauntless, Milo O&#x27;Shea as the King, Bill Kerr as the Wizard, Bill Hayes as the Minstrel, and Max Wall as the Jester. EMI Records took the cast into the recording studio and recorded a London Cast album. This was issued as a His Master&#x27;s Voice LP. The album was included on a CD titled &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot; issued by Sepia Records in 2010.

=== Subsequent revivals ===
A Broadway revival opened on December 19, 1996, at the Broadhurst Theatre and closed on May 31, 1997, after 35 previews and 188 regular performances. It starred Sarah Jessica Parker as Princess Winnifred, Mary Lou Rosa as Queen Aggravain, David Aaron Baker as Dauntless, Lewis Cleale as Sir Harry, Heath Lamberts as the King, Lawrence Clayton as the Minstrel, David Hibbard as the Jester, Tom Alan Robbins as Master Merton and Jane Krakowski as Lady Larken. The production was nominated for the 1997 Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical.

The musical opened Off-Broadway, produced by the Transport Group, at the Abrons Arts Center on December 13, 2015, for a limited run which ended on January 3, 2016. Directed by Jack Cummings III, the cast featured Jackie Hoffman as Princess Winnifred, John Epperson as Queen Aggravain, Jessica Fontana as Lady Larken, David Greenspan as The King, and Hunter Ryan Herdlicka as The Minstrel.

From January 24 until February 4, 2024, a concert production was staged as part of the New York City Center Encores! series. The production had a book adaptation by Amy Sherman-Palladino and direction by Lear deBessonet. Among the cast were Sutton Foster as Princess Winnifred, Michael Urie as Dauntless, Nikki Renée Daniels as Lady Larken, Cheyenne Jackson as Sir Harry, Harriet Sansom Harris as the Queen, David Patrick Kelly as the King, Francis Jue as the Wizard, and J. Harrison Ghee as the Jester. This production cut the role of the Minstrel as well as the song &quot;The Minstrel, the Jester, and I&quot;, and made the Jester non-binary using they/them pronouns, with an implied romance between the Jester and the Wizard.

In May 2024, it was announced that the production would transfer to Broadway in summer 2024. The show began previews on July 31 at the Hudson Theatre with an opening night on August 12. Foster and Urie reprised their respective roles of Winnifred and Dauntless and Daniels and Kelly reprised their respective roles of Lady Larken and the King. New to the cast were Brooks Ashmanskas as the Wizard, Daniel Breaker as the Jester, Will Chase as Sir Harry, and Ana Gasteyer as Queen Aggravain. The show ran through November 30 and then transferred to the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles for a four-week engagement lasting from December 10, 2024 to January 5, 2025. On Broadway, the production received mostly positive reviews with &quot;The New York Times&quot; giving the production a Critic&#x27;s Pick and praising both Foster and Urie in their roles while others including &quot;Variety&quot; noted that Foster was overall awkward in the role. A cast recording of the musical is scheduled for release on March 28, 2025.

==Television adaptations==
===1964===
The first television adaptation was aired on June 3, 1964, on CBS. The production was videotaped in black and white in front of a live audience and featured Burnett, Bova, Gilford, and White from the original Broadway cast, as well as new principals Bill Hayes as the Minstrel, Shani Wallis as Lady Larken and Elliott Gould (in his first appearance on any screen) as the Jester. Due to the reduced running time of 90 minutes, several songs and scenes were either cut or shortened. The character of Sir Harry was written out, and the Minstrel was rewritten to be Lady Larken&#x27;s love interest, with the conflict concerning them being downplayed to a secret marriage.
===1972===
The second television adaptation was broadcast on December 12, 1972, on CBS. This production, videotaped in color, included original Broadway cast members Burnett, Gilford and White, and also featured Bernadette Peters as Lady Larken, Ken Berry as Prince Dauntless, Ron Husmann as Sir Harry, Wally Cox as The Jester, and Lyle Waggoner as Sir Studley. It was directed by Ron Field and Dave Powers. Again, several songs were eliminated and characters were combined or altered. Since the parts of the Minstrel and the Wizard were cut from this adaptation, a new prologue was written with Burnett singing &quot;Many Moons Ago&quot; as a bedtime story. In 2016, the special was included as a bonus feature on the DVD &quot;Carol + 2: The Original Queens of Comedy&quot;.

===2005===

The third television version, which aired on December 18, 2005, on ABC in the United States as part of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; and was released on DVD two days later, starred Carol Burnett as Queen Aggravain, Denis O&#x27;Hare as Prince Dauntless, Tom Smothers as King Sextimus, Tracey Ullman as Princess Winnifred, Zooey Deschanel as Lady Larken, and Matthew Morrison as Sir Harry. It was directed by Kathleen Marshall and executive produced by Burnett and Martin Tudor. A prologue, cut from the DVD release, features a girl looking for Winifred, her favorite princess, at Disneyland, and meets a woman (Burnett) who tells her &quot;the real story.&quot; The Minstrel was cut from this version, except &quot;Normandy,&quot; which was changed to a love duet between Larken and Sir Harry. A new song, &quot;That Baby of Mine&quot; was written for Burnett.

==Plot==
===Act I===
A fictional medieval kingdom in 15th-century Europe is ruled by the devious Queen Aggravain and the mute King Sextimus the Silent. King Sextimus suffers from a curse cast by a witch that can only be reversed &quot;when the mouse devours the hawk.&quot; The Minstrel sings of the Princess and the Pea (&quot;Many Moons Ago&quot;), but reveals the story to be fake, though he knows the true tale because he was there when it happened. The princess in the story is not the first princess tested to see if she is worthy of marrying Prince Dauntless the Drab—she is the thirteenth princess. The day the Minstrel arrives at court, the Queen, alongside her confidant, the Wizard, is testing Princess #12 with an unfair quiz. To the Queen&#x27;s delight, the princess misses the last question: &quot;What was the middle name of the daughter-in-law of the best friend of the blacksmith who forged the sword that killed the Beast?&quot; and is given a rubber chicken by Sir Studley. The populace of the castle complains about an unjust law levied by Queen Aggravain: &quot;Throughout the land no one may wed, &#x27;till Dauntless shares his wedding bed.&quot; However, every petitioning princess is sent away after failing unfair tests devised by the Queen. It seems that no one is good enough to marry Prince Dauntless (&quot;An Opening for a Princess&quot;).

The crisis escalates when the leading knight of the realm, Sir Harry, discovers that his girlfriend, Lady Larken, is pregnant. Though Lady Larken says that she will run away so he will never have to face embarrassment and the loss of his station, Sir Harry decides that he will set out to find a princess himself (&quot;In a Little While&quot;). He petitions the Queen who immediately says no, but when Dauntless manages to speak up and beg, she gives in.

The Minstrel tells the audience that in the original story, the princess arrived at the castle on a stormy night (&quot;Many Moons Ago - Reprise&quot;), but in the true story, it was not night at all—and the princess only &quot;looked&quot; as though she went through a storm. Princess Winnifred the Woebegone, a brash and unrefined princess from the Marshlands, was so eager to arrive that she swam the castle moat. She immediately charms Dauntless, Studley, and the knights and most of the kingdom (&quot;Shy&quot;). However, she also earns the utter loathing of the evil Queen, who vows to stop her.

The King discovers Larken&#x27;s pregnancy and pantomimes this to his confidants, the Minstrel and the Jester. He tells them not to say a word, but they both are more worried about the King letting it slip, because even though he is mute, he can still communicate (&quot;The Minstrel, the Jester, and I&quot;). Later, the Queen, assisted by the Wizard, designs a test for Winnifred based on something they are sure she doesn’t have at all—sensitivity. They will place a tiny pea beneath twenty thick downy mattresses. If Winnifred is unable to sleep due to the pea, then she will be sensitive enough to marry Dauntless (&quot;Sensitivity&quot;).

Meanwhile, Winnifred tells Dauntless and the ladies in waiting about her home in the swamp (&quot;The Swamps of Home&quot;) and meets the King, and they immediately like each other. Then, after spilling a purple vase filled with fresh new baby&#x27;s breath, Winnifred is caught cleaning the mess by Lady Larken who mistakes her for a chambermaid. Soon Harry gets mad at Larken for her mistake and they get in a fight. Larken vows that she will run far far away where she will never see him again.
The King, the Minstrel and the Jester catch Larken trying to run away, and they try to stop her but in the end decide to help her escape to Normandy (&quot;Normandy&quot;). Later that night, the Queen throws a ball so Winnifred can dance the most exhausting dance in the world: &quot;The Spanish Panic&quot;. The Queen hopes that Winnifred will tire herself, but the plan fails. Winnifred is the last one standing as everyone collapses from exhaustion at the dance&#x27;s climax. She asks Dauntless to try to give her a clue as to what the test might be, but he&#x27;s not sure. He brings out a huge barbell that one of the princesses was asked to lift, but even he cannot lift it. Winnifred does easily and Dauntless admits that he loves her. Winnifred mentions that her nickname is Fred and Dauntless sings of his love for her as she practices numerous tasks she might have to do for the test, including singing, dancing, wrestling, acting, playing the Minstrel&#x27;s lute, pantomiming and drinking herself unconscious (&quot;Song of Love&quot;).

===Act II===
Later that night, the Queen leads the knights and ladies as they carry the twenty mattresses to Fred&#x27;s room (&quot;Quiet&quot;), and she catches the Minstrel, the Jester, the King, and Larken (disguised in Dauntless&#x27; clothes) running away. The Minstrel tries to protect Larken by saying he was escaping with Larken against her will. The Queen declares that the Minstrel will be banished by daybreak. Fred and Dauntless study for the test, and Fred convinces Larken to fix things with Harry. Larken leaves to find Harry, Dauntless bids Fred goodnight, and now she is left alone. While studying a fairy tale, she complains about how other fairy tale princesses had it easy and how she wants to live happily ever after (&quot;Happily Ever After&quot;). King Sextimus has a man to man talk with Dauntless about the birds and the bees completely in pantomime (&quot;Man to Man Talk&quot;). The Jester and Minstrel trick the Wizard into telling them of the test and the Jester reminisces about his father&#x27;s dancing days (&quot;Very Soft Shoes&quot;).

Sir Harry and Lady Larken run into each other and they confess that their love is stronger than ever (&quot;Yesterday I Loved You&quot;). When Fred is finally ready for bed, the Queen tries to make her even more sleepy by attempting to hypnotize her with a hypnotic mirror, burning poppy and mandragora incense, forcing her to drink a sleeping draught, and finally bringing in the Nightingale of Samarkand to sing her to sleep (&quot;Nightingale Lullaby&quot;), but Winnifred is kept wide awake. It seems that there is some &quot;lump&quot; under the mattresses that is keeping her from relaxing. She starts counting sheep.

The next morning, Dauntless dresses in his finest to see Winnifred pass the test, but the Queen tells him to his great disappointment that the test has already happened and what it was. She says that since Winnifred has not yet emerged from her room, she must still be sleeping and therefore has failed. Dauntless is heartbroken until Winnifred drowsily stumbles into the throne room while still counting sheep; she hasn&#x27;t slept a wink. Everyone is ecstatic that Winnifred has passed but the Queen insists that Dauntless should not throw himself away on Winnifred. Dauntless has had enough of his mother&#x27;s attempts to control his life and finally yells, &quot;I told you to &quot;shut up&quot;!&quot;. The curse on King Sextimus is lifted (the &quot;mouse&quot;, Dauntless, has metaphorically devoured the &quot;hawk&quot;, Queen Aggravain). Aggravain discovers that she cannot talk and the King can, so Dauntless and Winnifred are free to be married. The King forces the Queen to hop, skip, and jump around the room to everyone&#x27;s amusement, and with this, she is forced to step down.

Finally the real reason why Winnifred passed the test is revealed: after learning about the test, the King, Minstrel, and Jester stuffed the mattresses full of weapons, jousting equipment, and other sharp items. All the items are removed by the Jester in the finale (&quot;Finale&quot;). After the items are removed, Winnifred still has trouble sleeping until Dauntless takes the pea out from under the mattresses; she then falls asleep almost immediately, proving that she was indeed a true princess. Everyone, in classic fairy-tale tradition, lives happily ever after.

== Characters ==
* Princess Winnifred the Woebegone - Also known by her nickname, Fred, she’s the thirteenth princess tested by the Queen. She comes from the Marshland and is brought to the castle by Sir Harry. She is slightly childlike and much less refined than the rest of the castle&#x27;s residents. Her kingdom, Icolmkill, was far out of where Dauntless’ kingdom had searched for princesses before, but Sir Harry was noble enough to travel far and wide to find the perfect princess.
* Prince Dauntless the Drab - The son of Queen Aggravain and King Sextimus and next in line to the throne. He is also slightly childlike and easily falls in love with Winnifred just as he has with the many princesses that have come before. He is babied by his mother until he learns to stand up to her in the musical’s finale.
* Queen Aggravain - The villain of the musical, wife of King Sextimus, and mother of Prince Dauntless, who makes every princess suing for Dauntless’ hand take the extremely hard tests she creates. She is talkative, arrogant, full of herself, and is in constant disagreement with the King despite his not being able to talk. 
* King Sextimus the Silent - The (cursed) husband of Queen Aggravain, father of Prince Dauntless, and very good friend of the Jester and Minstrel. He cannot speak and communicates via pantomime before he speaks at the end and allows for Dauntless and Winnifred to be married. 
* The Minstrel - The narrator of the musical, who helps the King and the Jester many times, and are all very good friends. He is also very clever in his way of getting things, but is kind and smart with the way he does it. 
* The Jester - A complicated character of sorts, who is meant to be funny but is instead more sad or annoying than humorous. The Jester is great friends with the King and the Minstrel, and translates for the King frequently. 
* Lady Larken - A very kind and refined noblewoman who wishes to be married to Sir Harry and carries his child. She believed at first that Princess Winnifred was a chambermaid, and still voiced that she did afterwards. She attempts to escape the kingdom after breaking up with Sir Harry for a night, but returns to him and they fall in love again. 
* Sir Harry - The noble knight of the kingdom, who is in love with Lady Larken. He is the one who searches for Princess Winnifred, after passing the mountains and the badlands. His true reason for bringing a princess to the kingdom was so that he and Lady Larken could be married, as well as all the rest of the kingdom. 
* The Wizard - Also known as Cardamon, he’s a very quiet person, who usually keeps to himself, although he is basically the Queen&#x27;s minion, and puts her tests for the princesses in action. He does like the Jester and Minstrel, and they bond over his past with the Jester&#x27;s father.
* Ensemble - The men and women of the kingdom, who wish to be married to each other throughout the play. They also highly encourage Prince Dauntless to get married because they cannot be married until he marries a true princess.

<text>John White Hughes Bassett, (August 25, 1915 – April 27, 1998) was a Canadian media proprietor.

Born in Ottawa, Ontario, he was the son of John Bassett (1886–1958), publisher of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, and Marion Avery (née Wright).

==Education==
Bassett attended Ashbury College, Bishop&#x27;s College School and graduated from Bishop&#x27;s University with a BA in 1936.

==Politics==
After fighting with the Army in World War II, Bassett ran unsuccessfully for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, in the 1945 Canadian election in the riding of Sherbrooke, losing to Liberal incumbent, Maurice Gingues. He also ran in the 1962 election in the riding of Spadina losing to Liberal candidate Perry Ryan by less than 2,000 votes.

==Publishing and broadcasting==
He became a reporter for Toronto&#x27;s &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper after graduating from university. After World War II, he was hired by the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; as advertising director. His first experience in newspaper ownership was with the &quot;Sherbrooke Daily Record&quot;, which he bought from his father. In 1952, Bassett purchased part ownership of the &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot;. In 1960, he founded Telegram Corporation (later Baton Broadcasting) to run Toronto&#x27;s first commercial television station, CFTO-TV. A few months later, he won the television rights to the Eastern Conference of the Canadian Football League. He needed a network in order to broadcast the games. The result was the Canadian Television Network, later to become CTV, with CFTO as the flagship station. Starting in the 1980s, Bassett began a drive to take over CTV by buying as many stations as possible. He succeeded in 1997, a year before his death.

==Sports==
From 1957 to 1974, Bassett was the owner of the Toronto Argonauts, a team in the Canadian Football League.

In 1957, he was named to the &quot;Silver Seven,&quot; a committee that oversaw hockey operations for the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 1961, longtime Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe sold most of his shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. (which owned the Maple Leafs and Maple Leaf Gardens) to a partnership of his son Stafford, Toronto Marlboros president Harold Ballard and Bassett for $2.3 million. Smythe later claimed that he thought he was selling only to his son, but it is very unlikely that Stafford would have been able to raise the money on his own. Bassett became vice chairman of the Gardens&#x27; board of directors, ascending as chairman after Smythe resigned shortly after the Leaf’s won the Stanley Cup in 1962. Bassett&#x27;s name appears on the Stanley Cup 4 times—in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1967.

In 1969, Ballard and Stafford Smythe were charged with tax evasion and accused of using Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to pay for their personal expenses. Bassett persuaded the board to fire Smythe as president and Ballard as executive vice president. The board elected Bassett as the new president.

However, Bassett did not force Smythe and Ballard to sell their shares, and they both remained on the board. This was a serious strategic blunder on Bassett&#x27;s part; Smythe was still the largest shareholder, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the shares between them. A year later, Ballard and Smythe staged a proxy war to win back control. Faced with an untenable situation, Bassett resigned and sold his shares to Smythe and Ballard.

Bassett&#x27;s son, John F. Bassett, would follow in his father&#x27;s path of becoming a professional sports owner; the younger Bassett was a part owner of the World Hockey Association&#x27;s Ottawa Nationals, Toronto Toros and Birmingham Bulls; the World Football League&#x27;s Memphis Southmen and the United States Football League&#x27;s Tampa Bay Bandits.

==Government==
In 1989, he was appointed for a three-year term as chairman of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, an independent body that reports to the Parliament of Canada on the operations of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Due to the requirements under the Official Secrets Act, Bassett was sworn into the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

==Family==
Bassett married fellow Bishop&#x27;s University graduate Eleanor Moira Bradley of Sherbrooke on April 26, 1938, in the university&#x27;s St. Mark&#x27;s Chapel. They had three children: John, Doug, and David. After their divorce, Bassett married Isabel Bassett on July 17, 1967. They had three children (Avery, Sarah, and Matthew) and remained together until his death.

In the 1970s, his son John F. Bassett was the owner of the Toronto Toros, a hockey team in the World Hockey Association. Former tennis star Carling Bassett-Seguso is Bassett&#x27;s granddaughter.

==Honours==
* 1985 - Made an Officer of the Order of Canada.
* 1988 - Appointed to the Order of Ontario.

* 1992 - Promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada.

<text>Interstate 695 (I-695) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway that constitutes a beltway extending around Baltimore, Maryland, United States. I-695 is officially designated the McKeldin Beltway but is colloquially referred to as either the Baltimore Beltway or 695. The route is an auxiliary route of I-95, intersecting that route southwest of Baltimore near Arbutus and northeast of the city near White Marsh. It also intersects other major roads radiating from the Baltimore area, including I-97 near Glen Burnie, the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (B–W Parkway; MD 295) near Linthicum, I-70 near Woodlawn, I-795 near Pikesville, and I-83 in the Timonium area. 

Originally, a portion of the Baltimore Beltway between I-95 northeast of Baltimore and I-97 south of Baltimore was officially Maryland Route 695 (MD 695) and was not part of the Interstate Highway System, but is still signed as I-695. The Francis Scott Key Bridge that crossed over the Patapsco River was included in this section of the route before the bridge&#x27;s collapse on March 26, 2024. The bridge and its approaches were maintained by the Maryland Transportation Authority (MDTA), while the remainder of the Baltimore Beltway is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA). The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved the redesignation of MD 695 as I-695 on April 29, 2024.

The Baltimore Beltway was first planned in 1949 by Baltimore County; the state eventually took over the project, becoming part of the Interstate Highway System planned in 1956. The length of the route from MD 2 south of Baltimore clockwise to U.S. Route 40 (US 40) northeast of the city opened in stages from 1955 to 1962, providing an Interstate bypass of Baltimore. It was the first beltway in the US to be built as part of the Interstate Highway System. Plans were made to finish the remainder of the route, with a diversion to the Windlass and Patapsco freeways, opened in 1973, following the cancelation of a more outer route that was to partly follow what is today MD 702 (Southeast Boulevard). 

The Outer Harbor Crossing over the Patapsco River, which was dedicated to Francis Scott Key, who wrote &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, and its approaches were finished in 1977, completing the route around Baltimore. The approaches to the bridge were originally two lanes to accommodate a tunnel that was initially proposed to run under the river; in subsequent years, they were upgraded to a four-lane configuration compliant with Interstate Highway standards, allowing for this portion of the route to be signed as I-695 rather than MD 695. There are plans for I-695 that include high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes to ease traffic. In addition, the northeastern interchange with I-95 was reconstructed in 2014 to accommodate express toll lanes that were added to I-95, and construction took place in 2016 to remove I-695&#x27;s carriageway crossovers here.

==Route description==
===Curtis Creek to I-95===

Starting at the zero milepost in Baltimore, I-695, which is maintained by the MDTA, is four lanes wide. The route passes over Curtis Creek on a pair of drawbridges here, which have of vertical navigational clearance and provide access for tall ships to a US Coast Guard base further upstream. Continuing west through industrial areas into Anne Arundel County, the route encounters the northern terminus of MD 10 (Arundel Expressway) at a directional interchange, where maintenance switches to MDSHA. The interchange includes access to the next interchange, with MD 2 (Ritchie Highway), a major north–south route between Baltimore and the southern suburbs, in Glen Burnie. This interchange has access to northbound MD 2 in both directions and from northbound MD 2 to the westbound direction. Beyond MD 2, I-695 encounters I-895B, a short connector to I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway); this interchange provides access to southbound MD 2 from both directions and to the eastbound direction from southbound MD 2. Immediately past this interchange, I-695 comes to an interchange with the northern terminus of I-97, which terminates on the beltway.
The route continues west as a six-lane freeway, heading west into residential areas of Linthicum. It interchanges with MD 648 (Baltimore Annapolis Boulevard), where 132,330 vehicles travel I-695 every day, before turning northwest and intersecting MD 170 (Camp Meade Road) and passing over the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA)&#x27;s Baltimore Light RailLink. The route encounters the B–W Parkway (MD 295) at a cloverleaf interchange where the route&#x27;s signage changes from east–west to north–south at this interchange. It turns more to the north from here and heads into commercial areas, interchanging with MD 168 (Nursery Road) and Hammonds Ferry Road. Past this interchange, the route crosses the Patapsco River into Baltimore County and soon encounters a partial interchange with I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) with access only from the southbound direction of I-695 to I-895 northbound and from I-895 southbound to the northbound direction of I-695. Past this interchange, I-695 heads north, interchanging with Hollins Ferry Road in Lansdowne before passing under CSX Transportation&#x27;s Baltimore Terminal Subdivision and coming to an interchange with US 1 Alternate (US 1 Alt.; Washington Boulevard) in Arbutus. A short distance later, I-695 comes to a semi-directional interchange with I-95.

===I-95 to I-70===

I-695 widens to nine lanes past interchange with I-95, with five lanes in the southbound direction and four in the northbound direction. Running northwest, it crosses over Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor and comes to a partial interchange with US 1 (Southwestern Boulevard), with a southbound exit and northbound entrance. From here, it continues northwest through residential areas of Catonsville to an interchange with MD 372 (Wilkens Avenue). Narrowing to eight lanes total, with four lanes in each direction, beyond MD 372, the route continues through suburban neighborhoods before coming to an interchange with MD 144 (Frederick Road). At this point, I-695 narrows to seven lanes, with three southbound and four northbound lanes. It continues north and interchanges with Edmondson Avenue before turning northwest and intersecting US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) near the defunct Westview Mall, now a big-box complex. Beyond US 40, I-695 continues north through residential areas, narrowing to six lanes, with three lanes in each direction, before coming to a four-level stack interchange with I-70/MD 570 in Woodlawn.

===I-70 to I-83===

The Baltimore Beltway narrows from seven to six lanes within the interchange, which contains braided ramps providing access to the next interchange, MD 122 (Security Boulevard), located near Security Square Mall and the headquarters of the Social Security Administration. Continuing north, the road widens to eight lanes again and continues through a mix of suburban homes and business parks in Lochearn. I-695 interchanges with MD 26 (Liberty Road) east of Randallstown and resumes north, narrowing to six lanes. It intersects the southern terminus of I-795 (Northwest Expressway), which serves as a bypass of MD 140 in the Owings Mills area. The MTA&#x27;s Baltimore Metro SubwayLink line to Owings Mills passes under I-695 within the interchange and runs in the median of I-795 as far as that town. At the I-795 interchange, the signage of route changes from north–south to east–west.

From here, I-695 heads northeast as an eight-lane road and enters Pikesville, where it passes under CSX Transportation&#x27;s Hanover Subdivision and intersects MD 140 (Reisterstown Road) at a single-point urban interchange. A short distance later, the road comes to a partial interchange with MD 129 (Park Heights Avenue), with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance. I-695 heads east to another partial interchange with Stevenson Road, which has a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. The Baltimore Beltway passes through heavily forested land as it encounters Greenspring Avenue. Past this interchange, I-695 continues northeast through woodland before coming to an interchange with I-83 (Jones Falls Expressway). The interchange includes connections to MD 25 (Falls Road), which heads into the open countryside north of Baltimore. Within this interchange, I-83 forms a concurrency with I-695, and the roadway widens to 10 lanes, with six for the beltway and four for I-83. In each direction, I-695 runs on the three leftmost lanes, while I-83 uses the two rightmost ones. After running concurrently, I-83 splits from I-695 by heading north on the Harrisburg Expressway at a directional interchange and continues towards Timonium, Cockeysville and Hunt Valley before reaching York, Pennsylvania.

===I-83 to I-95===

Beyond I-83, I-695 passes over the MTA&#x27;s Baltimore Light RailLink and turns southeast as a six-lane road, heading into the county seat of Towson. Here, the road comes to an interchange with MD 139 (Charles Street). The Baltimore Beltway heads through residential and commercial areas before coming to interchanges with MD 45 (York Road) near The Shops at Kenilworth and MD 146 (Dulaney Valley Road). Continuing east, the Baltimore Beltway passes to the north of Goucher College and comes to an interchange with Providence Road. I-695 turns southeast through residential areas past Providence Road and comes to an interchange with MD 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard) and Cromwell Bridge Road. The road continues toward Parkville, where it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with MD 41 (Perring Parkway) within commercial areas. The Baltimore Beltway continues through residential areas into Carney, coming to another cloverleaf interchange with MD 147 (Harford Road). Continuing east into White Marsh, the route encounters the western terminus of MD 43 (White Marsh Boulevard), a limited-access at-grade boulevard that provides access to White Marsh Mall, US 1 and I-95.

I-695 turns south past MD 43 and interchanges with US 1 (Belair Road) south of White Marsh. The road continues southeast to an interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) a short distance after US 1 in Rossville. This interchange with I-95 (to the east of Baltimore city) is a fully directional interchange where the carriageways of both routes crossed over each other onto the opposite side, then crossed over each other again; at the site of each crossover, left-hand entrance and exit ramps were provided to eliminate the need for directional flyovers. In 2008, interchange reconstruction at the I-95 interchange removed the left-hand entrance from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 with the remaining left-hand entrances to be removed by August 2009 as part of the construction of the I-95 Express Toll Lane Project; all exits and entrances were now on the right, and I-95&#x27;s opposing roadways no longer crossed each other (but I-695&#x27;s still did).

===I-95 to Curtis Creek===

Continuing south, soon encounters MD 7 (Philadelphia Road). Between I-95 and MD 7, the route&#x27;s changes from east–west to north–south. Immediately after MD 7, the route interchanges with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) northwest of Essex near The Centre at Golden Ring. After US 40, I-695 crosses over CSX Transportation&#x27;s Philadelphia Subdivision and comes to a partial directional interchange with MD 702 (Southeast Boulevard). At this interchange, I-695 turns south onto the Windlass Freeway, crossing over the Northeast Corridor again within the interchange.

Running south along the Windlass Freeway, parallel to the Northeast Corridor, I-695, now narrowed to four lanes, turns west before making a sharp turn to the south, crossing over the railroad line twice. The road becomes the Patapsco Freeway and continues south to an interchange with MD 150 (Eastern Avenue) and MD 157 (Merritt Boulevard) near Eastpoint Mall. A short distance later, I-695 comes to an interchange with MD 151 (North Point Boulevard). From here, the route continues southeast along the Back River into residential and industrial Dundalk, interchanging with Cove Road. The route turns south, with the median briefly widening to include trees, before coming to another interchange with MD 151. Past MD 151, the Baltimore Beltway continues southwest through industrial areas, with maintenance switching to the MDTA at the crossing of a CSX Transportation rail line. It comes to an interchange with MD 157 (Peninsula Expressway) and MD 158 (Bethlehem Boulevard), where the highway currently terminates due to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. The route runs past Tradepoint Atlantic before crossing over Bear Creek and interchanging with unsigned MD 695A (Broening Highway) south of the Dundalk Marine Terminal, with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance (both of which have been closed since the bridge collapse).
Beyond this interchange, the route comes to a two-way all-electronic toll gantry with a U-turn ramp from the southbound to the northbound direction intended to provide southbound motorists access to MD 695A. This ramp, known as MD 695C, also provides access to northbound I-695 from MD 695A through Authority Drive. After this, the route ascended onto the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which carried I-695 over the lower Baltimore Harbor and Patapsco River until its collapse in 2024. Unlike the Fort McHenry or Baltimore Harbor tunnels, hazmat trucks were allowed to cross the Francis Scott Key Bridge. After crossing the Patapsco River over the bridge, the route touched down within the Baltimore city limits. It continues west past Thoms Cove through Hawkins Point&#x27;s industrial areas. It comes to an interchange with Quarantine Road (where the route resumes after the collapsed bridge), which provides access to MD 173, south of Curtis Bay. By this point, the route&#x27;s signage changes from north–south to east–west. Past this interchange, the Baltimore Beltway continues west and returns to the Curtis Creek drawbridges.

===Exit numbering===
As opposed to I-495 (Capital Beltway) around Washington, D.C., on which exit numbers are generally arranged by mileposts counterclockwise starting at the southern crossing of the Potomac River, the exit numbers for the Baltimore Beltway are arranged consecutively clockwise starting at interchange 1 at Quarantine Road, west of the Francis Scott Key Bridge crossing of the Patapsco River.

==History==

=== 20th century ===

==== Initial construction ====

The Baltimore County Planning Commission first conceived the Baltimore Beltway as a county-level roadway project in 1949; by 1953, the state took over the project due to slow progress at the county level. The project was included as part of the Interstate Highway System by 1956, increasing the speed of construction due to federal funds available.

The first part of the Baltimore Beltway was completed in December 1955 between MD 25 (Falls Road) and the Harrisburg Expressway (present-day I-83). In 1956, the next portion of the road between the Harrisburg Expressway and MD 45 (York Road) opened. Several more segments of the Baltimore Beltway would be built in the following years, with the section from MD 168 (Nursery Road) to the Glen Burnie Bypass (present-day I-97) opening in 1957; the portions from MD 45 to MD 542 (Loch Raven Boulevard), MD 7 (Old Philadelphia Road) to US 40 (Pulaski Highway), and from MD 168 to US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) opening in 1958; the segment from MD 2 (Ritchie Highway) to the Glen Burnie Bypass completed in 1960; the portion from US 1 (Belair Road) to MD 7 finished in 1961; and the portions from MD 542 to US 1 and from US 40 to MD 25 completed in 1962. At this time, the original length of the Baltimore Beltway, from MD 2 in the south clockwise to US 40 in the northeast, was fully completed and opened to traffic, providing the first Interstate-grade bypass of Baltimore and the first beltway in the US built under the Interstate Highway System. A segment of the road completed in 1973 ran from MD 10 to MD 2, heading toward the Outer Harbor Crossing.

==== Windlass and Patapsco freeways ====
From the junction with I-95, the Baltimore Beltway was planned to extend southeast along the Back River Neck peninsula, turning south to cross the Back River near the Essex Skypark airport, then heading towards the present Outer Harbor Crossing. Part of this alignment was completed as I-695 to the south of US 40 in 1972, then as MD 702 (Southeast Freeway), extending to MD 150 by 1975. However, the section of the Baltimore Beltway between south of MD 150 to west of the Back River crossing was not built, requiring it be rerouted on portions of two freeways not originally planned to be part of it.

The first was the Windlass Freeway (MD 149), a route planned to run from I-95 at Moravia Road northeast to Chase, paralleling US 40 to the south. The only portion of the Windlass Fwy constructed is the section of I-695 that diverges southwest from the directional T interchange with MD 702 to a point less than to the southwest where I-695 makes a sharp turn from west to south. From here, the Windlass Freeway would have continued to its southerly terminus at I-95. This sharp turn is half of what would have been another directional T interchange (which was to have become exit 37), marking the northern terminus of the Patapsco Freeway, the other freeway incorporated into the Baltimore Beltway. 

The Patapsco Freeway was planned to connect the Windlass Freeway to the originally-planned Baltimore Beltway. Completed in 1973, the planned Patapsco Freeway is now part of I-695. The wide median in I-695 south of exit 41 (Cove Road) is where the unbuilt beltway would have intersected the Patapsco Freeway after crossing Back River to the east, making this the southern terminus of the Patapsco Freeway. Continuing southeast, I-695 rejoins the original alignment of the beltway.
Ramp stubs for the planned Windlass Freeway are present at the proposed west end at I-95 and Moravia Road, and, at the present west end at the Southeast Freeway (MD 702), the partially built junction with the proposed Windlass Freeway. The planned junction of the Windlass and Patapsco freeways, now the point where I-695 makes a sharp turn from west to south, just to the north of where it crosses the Back River, was originally built with provisions for extending the Windlass Freeway to I-95, but this has since been reconfigured as a sharp curve on I-695.

==== Outer Harbor Crossing and further upgrades ====
The Outer Harbor Crossing is the name given to the segment of the Baltimore Beltway maintained by the MDTA. It consists of the segment of I-695 between exit 40 (MD 151) and exit 2 (MD 10), which included the Francis Scott Key Bridge. The route was originally planned as a two-lane freeway on a four-lane right-of-way, with a two-lane outer harbor tunnel across the Patapsco River. When the tunnel was advertised for construction in 1970, the bids were so high that the decision was made to construct a four-lane bridge instead. The bridge was to feature two-lane approach roads on both sides.

Construction on the Outer Harbor Crossing, including the bridge, started in 1972 and was opened on March 23, 1977, completing the full Baltimore Beltway. The bridge was named the Francis Scott Key Bridge in honor of Francis Scott Key, who wrote &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the national anthem of the US. By the early 1980s, the southern approach to the Francis Scott Key Bridge was dualized, with a second roadway constructed along with a second drawbridge over Curtis Creek. The northern approach was left as a two-lane viaduct in the Sparrows Point area until a four-lane surface freeway was constructed along this portion, with interchanges reconfigured, following an $89.5-million (equivalent to $ in ) project completed in January 2000. The Outer Harbor Crossing, as well as the entire Baltimore Beltway east of I-95, was first signposted as MD 695 because portions of it were a two-lane expressway not up to Interstate Highway standards. Improvements to the road have allowed the entire Baltimore Beltway to be signed as I-695, even though all of I-695 between the junction of I-95 northeast of Baltimore and I-97 is officially considered MD 695 by MDSHA.

On June 8, 1999, a tractor-trailer carrying a backhoe that exceeded the maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over the Baltimore Beltway just northwest of the I-95 junction near Arbutus. The footbridge collapsed onto the inner loop of the beltway. One driver was killed when his SUV struck the collapsed bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due to complaints about vandalism and crime.

=== 21st century ===
The beltway was dedicated in honor of former Governor Theodore McKeldin in May 2005. During his term, McKeldin was responsible for constructing the Beltway and other state highways. Most Marylanders still refer to the highway as the &quot;Baltimore Beltway&quot;, &quot;695&quot;, or (mainly among Baltimore metro area residents) simply &quot;The Beltway&quot;, like its Washington, D.C. counterpart.

In March 2009, construction began on the reconstruction of the bridge that carries MD 139 (Charles Street) over I-695. The bridge is decorative, featuring ornamental street lights. As part of the MD 139 project, the interchange was reconstructed, and the traffic circle at the MD 139/I-695 ramps was removed and replaced with a traffic signal. This project cost $50 million (equivalent to $ in ) and was completed in 2012.
At exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both highways had crossed over themselves so that through traffic was on the left side of the road with left-hand entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange was replaced in 2014 by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95&#x27;s double crossovers. The ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 was completed in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 was completed in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 was completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project also adds four ramps to service the HOT lanes being added to I-95.

In April 2024, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved designating the MD 695 section of the beltway as I-695.

====Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse====
On March 26, 2024, the Francis Scott Key Bridge on I-695 collapsed after a ship collided with the bridge. The incident killed six construction workers and forced traffic to be rerouted to Interstate 895. Following the collapse, the section of I-695 between MD 157 (exit 43) and MD 173 (exit 1), including exit 44, was closed.

==Future==
There are long-term plans to add new lanes to I-695 to ease traffic congestion along the northern and western parts of the route between the two interchanges with I-95. These plans would widen the sections between I-95 and I-70 on the west side and between the Jones Falls Expressway and I-95 on the north side. Work on the widening project began in 2020. In addition, there are plans to add a fourth lane between the ramps to I-795, ending the disappearing fourth lanes in this section. A multiyear project to replace the stack interchange at I-70/MD 570, under design as of 2022, would allow at least eight lanes to pass under this interchange. All these projects will enable up to 10 lanes to be constructed at a future date. Also, ramp meters will be installed at selected entrances. After the Key Bridge collapsed, President Joe Biden announced that the bridge would be rebuilt.

==Exit list==
Exits are numbered sequentially (unlike other Interstates in Maryland which use a milepost-based system) and in a clockwise (inner loop) direction, in accordance with American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines.




















==Auxiliary routes==

*Maryland Route 695A (MD 695A) runs along Broening Highway, a two-lane undivided road that begins at I-695 exit 44 and heads northwest through residential and industrial areas in Dundalk, Baltimore County, to the Baltimore city line. The route provides access to the Dundalk Marine Terminal from I-695. MD 695A is long.
*Maryland Route 695B (MD 695B) runs along Belclare Road from MD 695A north to Dundalk Avenue in Dundalk, Baltimore County. The route is long.
*Maryland Route 695C (MD 695C) runs along Authority Drive from MD 695A southwest to I-695 in Dundalk, Baltimore County, looping under the route at the Francis Scott Key Bridge to merge onto northbound I-695. MD 695C serves as part of a U-turn ramp to provide access to MD 695A from southbound I-695 and to provide access to northbound I-695 from MD 695A. The route is long.

Kuo previously worked as director for international communications for Chinese search engine Baidu. Before that he was a technology correspondent for &quot;Red Herring&quot; magazine, and also worked as director of digital strategy, China, for Ogilvy &amp; Mather in Beijing.

In April 2016, Kuo announced that the Sinica Podcast was acquired by an unnamed New York startup and that he would return to the United States with his family to focus full-time on Sinica. Kuo and Goldkorn co-hosted the podcast until its sponsor, The China Project (formerly SupChina), announced in November 2023 that it was shutting down operations due to a lack of funding

<doc id="1259905" wikidata="Q1059046" url="?curid=1259905" title="Merkit">
<text>The Merkit (; ; ) was one of the five major tribal confederations of Mongol or Turkic origin in the 12th-century Mongolian Plateau.

The Merkits lived in the basins of the Selenga and lower Orkhon River (modern south Buryatia and Selenge Province). After a struggle of over 20 years, they were defeated in 1200 by Genghis Khan and were incorporated into the Mongol Empire.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Merkit&quot; (&quot;Merged&quot;) with a hard &quot;g&quot; is a plural form derived from the Mongolian word &quot;mergen&quot; (мэргэн), which means both &quot;wise&quot; and &quot;skillful marksperson&quot;, e.g. adept in the use of bow and arrow. The word is also used in many phrases in which it connotes magic, oracles, divination, augury, or religious power. Mongolian language has no clear morphological or grammatical distinction between nouns and adjectives, so &quot;mergen&quot; may mean &quot;a sage&quot; as much as &quot;wise&quot; or mean &quot;skillful&quot; just as much as &quot;a master&quot;. &quot;Merged&quot; becomes plural as in &quot;wise ones&quot; or &quot;skillful markspeople&quot;. In the general sense, &quot;mergen&quot; usually denotes someone who is skillful and wise in their affairs.

== Three Merkits ==
The Merkits were a confederation of three tribes, inhabiting the basin of the Selenga and Orkhon Rivers.
* The Uduyid Merkits lived in Buur-kheer, near the lower Orkhon River;
* The Uvas Merkits lived in Tar, between the Orkhon and Selenge Rivers;
* The Khaad Merkits (&quot;Kings&quot; Merkits) lived in Kharaji-kheer, on the Selenge River.

== Ethnic relations ==
The Merkits were related to the Mongols, Naimans, Keraites, and Khitan people.

== Conflict with Genghis Khan ==
Temüjin&#x27;s mother Hoelun, originally from the Olkhonud, had been engaged to the Merkit chief Yehe Chiledu by 1153. She was abducted by Temüjin&#x27;s father Yesugei, while being escorted home by Yehe Chiledu.

In turn, Temüjin&#x27;s new wife Börte was kidnapped by Merkit raiders from their campsite by the Onon river around 1181 and given to one of their warriors. Temüjin, supported by his brother (not blood-related) Jamukha and his &quot;khan etseg&quot; (&#x27;khan father&#x27;) Toghrul of the Keraites, attacked the Merkit and rescued Börte within the year. The Mergids were dispersed after this attack. Shortly thereafter she gave birth to a son named Jochi. Temüjin accepted paternity, but the question lingered throughout Jochi&#x27;s life. These incidents caused a strong animosity between Temüjin&#x27;s family and the Merkits. From 1191 to 1207, Temujin fought the Merkits five times.

By the time he had united the other Mongol tribes and received the title Genghis Khan in 1206, the Merkits seem to have disappeared as an ethnic group. Those who survived were likely absorbed by other Mongol tribes (Oirats, Buryats, Khalkhas) and others who fled to the Kipchaks mixed with them. In 1215–1218, Jochi and Subutai crushed the remnants of them under their former leader Toghta Beki&#x27;s family. The Mongols clashed with the Kankalis or the Kipchaks because they had sheltered the Merkit.

Genghis Khan had a Merkit khatun (queen) named Khulan. She died while Mongol forces besieged Ryazan in 1236. In 1236, during the Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria, a body of the Merkit was found in the area of land dominated by the Bulgar and Kipchak.

== Late Merkits ==
A few Merkits achieved prominent position among the Mongols, but they were classified as Mongols in Mongolian society. Great Khan Guyuk&#x27;s beloved khatun Oghul Qaimish, who was a regent from 1248 to 1251, was a Merged woman. The traditionalist Bayan and his nephew Toqto&#x27;a served as grand chancellors of the Yuan dynasty. After the fall of the Yuan dynasty, they were a clan of a banner in the Northern Yuan dynasty.

<text>The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s class H8, H9s and H10s steam locomotives were of the 2-8-0 &quot;Consolidation&quot; type, the last three classes of such built by the railroad. The three classes differed only in cylinder diameter and thus tractive effort, each subsequent class increasing that measurement by an inch. The first H8 was built in 1907 and the last H10 in 1916; within a few years they were replaced on heavy freight assignments by 2-8-2s and 2-10-0. They became the railroad&#x27;s standard light freight locomotive, replacing all other class H 2-8-0s, and a number remained in service until the end of PRR steam locomotive operation in 1957. 968 class H8 of various subclasses were constructed, along with 274 class H9s and 273 class H10s. A number of H8 locomotives were rebuilt to H9s specification.

Class H10s was built primarily for PRR Lines West, and featured a typical Lines West tender with sloping side coal boards at the top, to enable a bigger load of coal to be carried.

Some locomotives of this type were leased to the PRR-owned Long Island Rail Road, becoming the primary freight-hauling type on that system.

==Survivors==
7688, an H10s built in 1915 by the Lima Locomotive Works, has been preserved by the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. It joins two earlier examples of the H class at the museum. #7688 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as Consolidation Freight Locomotive No. 7688.

<doc id="1259921" wikidata="Q7555845" url="?curid=1259921" title="Solar (room)">
<text>The solar was a room in many English and French medieval manor houses, great houses and castles, mostly on an upper storey, designed as the family&#x27;s private living and sleeping quarters. Within castles they are often called the &quot;Lords&#x27; and Ladies&#x27; Chamber&quot; or the &quot;Great Chamber&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;solar&quot; has two possible origins: it may derive from the Latin word &quot;solaris&quot; meaning sun (often a room with the brightest aspect), or — as the solar provided privacy for its occupants — it may come from the Latin word, &quot;solus&quot;, meaning, &quot;alone&quot;.

==Function==
In some houses, the main ground-floor room was known as the Great Hall, in which all members of the household, including tenants, employees, and servants, would often or could sometimes eat. Those of highest status would be at the end, often on a raised dais, and those of lesser status seated further down the hall. But a need was felt for more privacy to be enjoyed by the heads of the household, encouraged by the senior women, who wanted a daytime space to talk, read and view parts of the grounds. The solar was the key inner family room, for seclusion from the hustle, bustle, noise and smell (above all from cooking) of the great hall.

The solar was generally smaller than the great hall as it was not expected to house so many people. It was a room of comfort and status, and usually included a fireplace and often decorative woodwork or tapestries/wall hangings. 

The solar was almost ubiquitous among late castles across the British Isles, such as Broughton Castle, in Oxfordshire, and Stokesay Castle in Shropshire. In the medieval house of Great Dixter, in East Sussex, it consists of three rooms and a fireplace from the late 15th century. In Windsor Castle its walls are painted green with gold stars.

In manor houses of Normandy and northern France, the solar was sometimes a separate tower or pavilion, away from the great hall to provide more privacy to the lord and his family. 

The possibly related term &quot;grianán&quot; (from Irish &quot;grian&quot;, &quot;the sun&quot;; often anglicised as &quot;greenawn&quot;) was used in medieval Ireland for a sunny parlour or reception room. By extension it was used to refer to any summer palace or noble house.

==Paradigm examples==
In England from north to south:
* Edlingham Castle in Northumberland, castle in ruins but solar tower is mostly intact.
* Calverley Old Hall in West Yorkshire has a solar, now converted to holiday accommodation.
* Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, has hall and large solar block later converted into a tower.
* Longthorpe Tower, Peterborough, an extension to an existing fortified manor house.
* Beverston Castle near Tetbury, dating from the 13th century, has a surviving but ruined solar in the south tower of the west range, with a vaulted undercroft below. 
* Highclere Castle near Newbury — its suite of rooms used by the owning family are demonstrated in the serial TV &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, but the house is post-medieval.
* Great Dixter, in Northiam — home of the late British gardener and author Christopher Lloyd, has a recreated solar.

<doc id="1259929" wikidata="Q2670790" url="?curid=1259929" title="Pseudopanax">
<text>Pseudopanax (Latin for &quot;false ginseng&quot;) is a small genus of 7 species of evergreen plants which are endemic to New Zealand. Flowers of the genus occur in terminal umbels.

==Taxonomy==
A 2000 molecular study established that several species within the genus were only distantly related to the core group of New Zealand species related the type species &quot;P. crassifolius&quot;. They were removed to the genus &quot;Raukaua&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Pseudopanax&quot; occur in forest or scrub environments. The genus contains some remarkable small trees with distinctly different juvenile and adult forms, such as &quot;Pseudopanax crassifolius&quot; and &quot;Pseudopanax ferox&quot; (commonly referred to as &#x27;lancewood&#x27; and &#x27;toothed lancewood&#x27;, respectively).

==Cultivation==
Many of the species are popular in New Zealand gardens, but are rather rare in cultivation elsewhere, requiring mild, moist conditions similar to those in New Zealand, without extremes of temperature in winter and summer. They reportedly grow well in Southern California and warmer parts of Great Britain. A number of cultivars have been developed, mostly of &quot;Pseudopanax lessonii&quot;. These include &#x27;Gold Splash&#x27;, which has yellow variegated leaves, and &#x27;Nigra&#x27; which has dark purple-brown foliage. A National Trust listed specimen of &quot;Pseudopanax crassifolius&quot; exists on the Alton property at Mount Macedon, Victoria, Australia, which is 21 metres high and has an 11.5 m spread. Its age is estimated at 100 years.

==Host plant==
In New Zealand various species in this genus have been shown to be the host plant for the larvae of &quot;Scolopterus penicillatus&quot;, a common endemic weevil. The larvae develop in recently dead bark.

<doc id="1259935" wikidata="Q157679" url="?curid=1259935" title="Antestor">
<text>Antestor () is a Norwegian Christian extreme metal band formed in 1990 in Jessheim. Credited for starting the northern European Christian black metal scene, Antestor is the only Christian band to have an album released by Cacophonous Records, which has also released records by bands such as Dimmu Borgir, Sigh, and Cradle of Filth. The band&#x27;s only release on Cacophonous, &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot;, proved influential for the Christian black metal movement; it has sold over 10,000 copies.

In the late 1990s, they dubbed their musical style as &quot;sorrow metal&quot; rather than black metal because the early Norwegian black metal scene was publicly affiliated with Satanism in Norway. According to &quot;HM&quot; magazine, the progressive elements on the debut album, &quot;Martyrium&quot;, were possibly ahead of their time in the Norwegian extreme metal scene.

The group has gone through several line-up changes over the years, and currently Antestor consists of the founding guitarist Lars Stokstad (Vemod), vocalist Ronny Hansen (Vrede), bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen, guitarist Robert Bordevick, and drummer Henning Børven. The original vocalist Kjetil Molnes (Martyr) and drummer Svein Sander (Armoth) left the band around 2000, and the members of a fellow Norwegian black metal group, Vaakevandring, joined Antestor. The reputable Norwegian extreme metal drummer Jan Axel Blomberg (Hellhammer) played session drums for their 2005 album &quot;The Forsaken&quot; and &quot;Det tapte liv&quot; EP. A fourth studio album, &quot;Omen&quot;, was released in 2012.

==History==

===Crush Evil era===
In 1990, the band was formed under the name Crush Evil by Lars Stokstad, Kjetil Molnes, Øyvind Hope and Erling Jørgensen in Jessheim, Norway. Paul W joined them as a drummer later on. Back then, the band&#x27;s music style was a mixture of death metal, doom metal, and thrash metal.
In 1991, they recorded and released their first demo, &quot;The Defeat of Satan&quot;, which contains three songs and an outro. The band is Christian and over the course of their career have received death threats because of this.

The existence of the band itself caused a debate in the metal underground. For example, during the early 1990s, Bård Faust of Emperor brought up the subject when he discussed with Euronymous, guitarist/vocalist from the seminal black metal band Mayhem, in his zine Orcustus about the Norwegian scene. Faust asked: &quot;Don&#x27;t you think that something is terribly wrong when it has gone so far that we have a Christian &quot;death metal&quot; band here (Crush Evil)? Any advice on how we should kill them?&quot; Euronymous replied to this: &quot;It&#x27;s bad enough to have a couple of society bands, but a Christian band is too much. But don&#x27;t worry, we have plans. They will not continue for a very long time.&quot; However, the band persevered despite these threats. Antestor was never forced to split apart, and in an almost ironic twist of fate, Jan Axel Blomberg (better known as Hellhammer, the drummer for Mayhem) was Antestor&#x27;s session drummer on their latest two releases.

===&quot;Martyrium &quot;(1993–1996)===
In 1993, Vegard Undal joined the band as a bassist and Svein Sander became their drummer. During that time, they changed the name Crush Evil to Antestor, which is Latin () for &quot;to call to witness&quot; or &quot;testify&quot;. &quot;Despair&quot; was their first self-released demo, and was released under the band name Antestor. The demo starts with an intro and ends with a cover of an old Norwegian hymn, called &quot;Jesus, Jesus, Ver Du Hjå Meg&quot; (&quot;Jesus, Jesus, Be With Me&quot;). Strawberry Records pressed 600 copies of the recording.

In December 1994, Antestor recorded their first full-length album titled &quot;Martyrium&quot;. Arctic Serenades Records was originally supposed to release that album, but because of unknown reasons that never happened, and the band tried to get another label to release the album. American-based label Morphine Records would subsequently distribute bootleg copies of the album in 1997. In an interview, the drummer Armoth said: &quot;...we were in contact with a label called Morphine Records. But that was about signing a deal for the &quot;Martyrium&quot; album. But we never signed a contract but that guy, Burrito, made several promotapes and sold every bit of it illegally &#x27;cause he didn&#x27;t have a contract.&quot; However, the tape copies circulated in up to fifth generation copies and their audience grew fast. &quot;Martyrium&quot; was the last album that emphasized the band&#x27;s death/doom direction.

On June 3, 1994 Antestor appeared on a local television program called &quot;BootlegTV&quot; where youth could practice and experience recording and video production. Usually local bands from Oslo played on that program which was broadcast on the television station TVNorge. During the course of this program, Antestor played five songs from &quot;Martyrium&quot;. On June 6, 1995 Antestor was featured on the Norwegian weekly newspaper &quot;Morgenbladet&quot;&#x27;s article about the phenomenon of Christian black metal, surrounding the black metal parody controversy of the Australian unblack metal group Horde&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Hellig Usvart&quot;. In the article, vocalist Kjetil Molnes explains the band&#x27;s stance on if a Christian band can play black metal: &quot;We identify ourselves as black metal as a music style, not black metal as an ideology or belief.&quot;

===&quot;The Return of the Black Death &quot;(1997–1998)===
In 1997, Antestor recorded a promotional CD titled &quot;Kongsblod&quot;. The promo-CD caught the interest of British Cacophonous Records, one of the biggest labels with experience in the black metal style and helped established groups such as Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir start their career. Cacophonous signed a record deal for two albums with Antestor. In 1998, Cacophonous released &quot;Kongsblod&quot; under a different name, &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot;, and changed the original cover art of a famous Norwegian painting to artwork by Joe Petagno, a well-known American heavy metal cover art creator.

Cacophonous being a secular label releasing material by a band that held Christian beliefs generated some interest in the metal scene. In an interview with &quot;Art for the Ears Webzine&quot;, published on December 12, 1998, Armoth said: &quot;We sent the CD and a short biography. They just wanted to sign us because of the music. And that&#x27;s exactly what we wanted to do.&quot; 2 years later in a 2000 interview with the Finnish &quot;The Christian Underground Zine&quot; issue 4, the fanzine&#x27;s interviewer asked Antestor: &quot;However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth). What kind of experiences did you get from that?&quot; The band replied: &quot;Pretty bad, actually. I can not say they did anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing.&quot; The interviewer also asked: &quot;Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?&quot; Antestor replied: &quot;Nothing like that. They just said that it is not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words &#x27;Lord&#x27; and &#x27;Jesus&#x27; from our lyrics. We ourselves removed a few texts because we did not want to provoke unnecessarily.&quot;

&quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot; was mostly well received by both Christian and non-Christian black metal fans and critics. For example, the British metal magazines &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Terrorizer&quot; both gave the album 4 points out of 5. Musically, &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot; is a mixture of black metal and doom metal. The album relies on hypnotic, cold atmosphere and showcases influences from Norwegian folk music, which led some to label Antestor as Viking metal. Unlike previously, around this time the band themselves said they felt uncertain whether a Christian band can play black metal, because the movement was still strongly associated with Satanism. The drummer Svein Sander says in the 1998 interview:

===&quot;The Forsaken &quot;(2000–2009)===

In 2000, Antestor was signed by Endtime Productions, a metal record label that also helped to start the career of the Norwegian metal band Extol. The original vocalist Kjetil Molnes (Martyr) left Antestor. However, the breakup of another Christian metal band in Norway, Vaakevandring, led to several former Vaakevandring members joining Antestor. Namely, Ronny Hansen, adopting the new moniker Vrede, became Antestor&#x27;s new vocalist, and Morten Sigmund Mageroy (known in Antestor as Sygmoon) stepped in as the new keyboardist. Ann-Mari Edvardsen, who has sung in the Norwegian gothic metal group The Third and the Mortal, joined the band as a female vocalist. For the first time in their career, Antestor began using the infamous corpse paint masks as a part of their live shows and overall image.

In 2000, Endtime Productions released &quot;Martyrium&quot; with cover art done by the reputive Swedish metal music cover artist Kristian Wåhlin. Antestor toured the United States with Extol that year, playing small venues and finally performing at Cornerstone Festival. Over the next several years, the band remained somewhat quiet; they did not release any more albums until 2003, when they re-released their two earliest demos on one CD, titling it &quot;The Defeat of Satan&quot;. The drummer Svein Sander left the band during this time, and Antestor would not find a new full-time drummer for several years.

In 2004, Antestor changed their style into a more modern black metal, and released their first set of new songs since &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot; in an EP called &quot;Det tapte liv&quot; (&quot;The Lost Life&quot;). &quot;Det tapte liv&quot; concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor&#x27;s style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, &quot;The Forsaken&quot;. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In an interview with the Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: &quot;To be honest, it was a big &#x27;fuck off!&#x27; to them all. I will repeat again that I decide what I do and I play not only in black metal groups.&quot; The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: &quot;In my opinion, black metal today is just music. I will tell you that neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music.&quot; Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg&#x27;s appearance:

New drummer Tony Kirkemo joined the band later in 2005 as live session drummer. The band played live shows rarely and only at explicitly Christian music festivals. Examples of performances the group have made in 2000s include the concerts at Bobfest in 2000 in Stockholm and 2004 in Linköping, and at the Nordic Fest 2004 in Oslo.

Some of the members still play in the black metal band Vaakevandring, who played a reunion concert in 2007 together with Antestor at the Endtime Festival held at the end of March 2007 in Halmstad. Antestor performed the concert with numerous session musicians. In this concert the band announced that this is their last live show for a while.

=== &quot;Omen&quot; (2010–present) ===
After three years of hiatus, on January 29, 2010, the band launched an official Facebook page. Later they announced new members: Bassist Thor Georg Buer (Grave Declaration), guitarist Robert Bordevik (Grievance, Vardøger), drummer Jo Henning Børven (Grave Declaration, Morgenroede) and keyboardist Nickolas Main Henriksen (Aspera, Desdemon). With this line-up, the band played a stage show at Nordic Fest 2010 in Oslo. On November 4, 2010 they announced signing to Bombworks Records to record a new album and an EP. After some line-up changes in mid-2011, Erik Normann Aanonsen (Moddi) joined on bass while Thor Georg switched to guitar, and the show at the Norwegian Seaside Festival was with that line-up. The album has been recorded and will be mixed and mastered in Sweden. Guitarist Thor also left the band to focus on his college education, but stated he may return if the opportunity arises. The fourth album, &quot;Omen&quot;, was released on November 30, 2012. A Brazilian tour was announced for early 2013. During the Belo Horizonte leg of this tour, the band faced a protest organized by Black Metal/Anti-Christianity radicals who rejected the possibility of a Christian black metal band to perform in the city. Since the radicals were already announcing their intentions via Internet, the local police had assigned one private policeman in addition to the 30 security guards present to help guaranteeing the security of the show. At one point, the officer had to fire some shots towards the sky to control the rioters. A video posted on YouTube shows a group of radicals screaming &quot;Fuck You Antestor!&quot; outside the venue and the local police escorting the band members.

After the show, the band posted a public statement about the incident, thanking their fans for coming despite the risks involved, and blessing the radicals: &quot;We are proud to call you our brothers and sisters in Christ. Last but not least we must thank the gig securety and the Belo Horizonte police for escorting us though the angry mob. [...] We do not hate the angry mob who came to hurt us. In fact, our message in our shows is to love your enemy. So God bless everybody who stood outside chanting: Fuck Antestor! Hope we can talk like reasonable people someday over a fresh squeezed juice. Extra special hails to our fans who had the balls to come although they knew it could be dangerous. Antestor salutes you and be blessed.&quot; In a newspaper interview with the Norwegian Christian newspaper &quot;Dagen&quot; two days following the band&#x27;s safe return to Norway, bassist Erik Normann Aanonsen said that he had prepared himself for the worst-case scenario that the tour could end in death, and he reiterates the band&#x27;s gratitude to the aggressive Brazilian Satanists stating: &quot;We&#x27;re now twice as big in Brazil as we were before we went there.&quot;

On April 12, 2015, guitarist Robert Bordevik announced his departure from the band.

==Style==

===Music===
While the band&#x27;s style on the first publications was primarily death/doom with correspondingly slow songs and death growl singing, the band began playing black metal on the 1998 album &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot;. On that album the band showcased screaming vocals, tremolo guitar riffs and drum passages with increased speed typical for the black metal genre. Keyboard is also in a central role, which for the typical black metal is used to perform epic interludes and dominates the soundscapes. For example, over the first three minutes of the song &quot;Sorg&quot;, only the keyboard melody leads the performance.

With the third album &quot;The Forsaken&quot; the band developed more in the direction of a more technical style, as it is apparent on the style of &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot;. The band&#x27;s musical development resulted in that &quot;The Forsaken&quot; includes several guitar solos. Also the quality of production compared to &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot; improved. Through the introduction of the two ex-members of Vaakevandring, the style became more melodic and atmospheric.

===Lyrics===
Antestor&#x27;s lyrical themes include hope and despair, but also deal with the personal Christian faith of the band members. Therefore, many metal fans oppose classifying Antestor&#x27;s style to the category of black metal, as their lyrics are often contrary to the ideology of black metal. The lyrics are mostly in English. Norwegian texts are also rare for the group, but on the album &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot; the Norwegian language dominates the lyrics. On this album, only part of the lyrics are listed in the booklet; words directly referring to Jesus Christ and God were omitted. The song &quot;A Sovereign Fortress&quot; dealt with, for example, the acknowledgments of God who protects and supports the lyrical I since birth. It is portrayed in the chorus of this song as:

&quot;Sorg&quot; (Norwegian for: grief, sorrow, sadness), however, deals with the themes of the sorrow and the search for hope, with the song based on darker imagery, and the lyrics are not explicitly Christian yet are not negative in the end. An example (in the Norwegian language):

Another song that is also a dark, but this takes on Christian theme, is &quot;Ancient Prophecy&quot;. The lyrics tells that the man was sinful, and no one can escape the court of God. Antestor process in their lyrics also topics such as suicide, doubts about the certainty of salvation, and longing death, all of which are rare themes for a Christian band, however common to several subdivisions of Black metal, such as DSBM. An example from the text &quot;Betrayed&quot; from the album &quot;The Forsaken&quot;:

===Appearance===
Antestor are one of the few bands in the Christian metal scene who use corpse paint in their appearances and on photos. One example is the booklet photos in the album &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot;, depicting Antestor in Norsemen outfits and black and white face paints at a snowy Norwegian mountain location. Sometimes the group uses art blood, as known for the session bassist Ravn Furfjord&#x27;s (Frosthardr) appearance at the Bobfest 2004 concert. The band explains that corpse paint &quot;is the same for us as masking is for actors or mimes; One way to express certain feelings in the battle we are in. The main purpose is to concentrate on God and not to break a lance in side issues like these.&quot;

==Reception==
According to Vrede in an interview with &quot;Intense Radio&quot; on December 13, 2007, &quot;by various sources, &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot; has sold over 10,000 copies and still keeps selling.&quot;

Very few published reviews of the band&#x27;s albums exist, yet the ones that are available are positive, often good and some excellent. Michael Bryzak writes in the liner notes of &quot;The Defeat of Satan / Despair&quot; that, although the first album was not officially released until 2000, &quot;&quot;Martyrium&quot; was rightfully considered a cult classic.&quot;

The group&#x27;s position in the Norwegian metal scene was controversial from the beginning. Bryzak writes that &quot;standing up for their faith in Life and Hope, Antestor received serious death threats during this time from some of the major bands and key players of the scene.&quot; When asked if the band ever played with other groups in the black metal scene, Antestor said in a 2000 interview with &quot;Tcu zine&quot;: &quot;We played with some early form of the band Old Man&#x27;s Child once. Apparently they expressed their opinion of us with their legs and walked out of the venue during our set. It was their way of saying &#x27;screw you Christians.&#x27;&quot; In the liner notes of &quot;Martyrium&quot;, Antestor corresponds in a slightly bitter tone: &quot;For those of you who despised us, disbelieved in us and misplaced your anger upon us, may God have mercy on your poor souls!&quot;

On Antestor&#x27;s achievements, Bryzak wrote that &quot;The birth of northern Europe&#x27;s Christian extreme metal scene can be attributed to only one act, Antestor.&quot; In 2010, &quot;HM Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;The Return of the Black Death&quot; number 40 on their Top 100 Christian metal albums of all-time list with Beck stating about the album, &quot;Devastatingly dark, &quot;TRBD&quot; set the standard for Christian black metal.&quot;
Jamie Lee Rake of &quot;HM Magazine&quot; wrote of the Endtime Productions re-release of &quot;Martyrium&quot;, wondering if the progressive elements of the album made the band unnoticed innovators in the early Norwegian extreme metal scene:

His paternal uncle, Gerhard, was the father of the infamous nazi collaborator Stella Goldschlag and another uncle, George, was a writer.

His father had died in 1930 due to a chronic illness contracted during WWI and his mother not having sufficient money to raise him had to leave him at the orphanage in 1933 while she went into hiding. She was only able to visit him occasionally.

In 1934, Alan Coatsworth, a Toronto fire-insurance broker and a Methodist who wanted to finance the escape of a refugee from Nazi Germany and through communication with two rabbis Maurice Eisendrath from Toronto and Leo Baeck in Germany, Coatsworth was made aware of Goldschlags situation, and in 1937 helped him leave Germany and adopted Goldschlag. 

Goldschlag attended Vaughan Road Collegiate and it was the wish of Coatsworth that he became a rabbi. In 1939 his mother was able to leave Germany emigrated to the Dominican Republic. She and her son was reunited in the 1940s.

==Career==
After earning his master&#x27;s degree in Arabic at the University of Toronto, he joined the diplomatic and foreign affairs department.
==Public service==

<doc id="1259958" wikidata="Q7747354" url="?curid=1259958" title="The Lillingtons">
<text>The Lillingtons were a pop-punk band formed in 1995 in Newcastle, Wyoming. The band is composed of its original members, vocalist and lead guitarist Kody Templeman, drummer Tim O’Hara, bassist Cory Laurence, and later added rhythm guitarist Alex Volonino.

==History==
The original lineup consisting of Kody Templeman, Zack Rawhauser, Cory Laurence, and Tim (Timmy V) O&#x27;Hara as a four-piece only recorded the first 7&quot;,&quot;I Lost My Marbles&quot;, produced by Joe King of The Queers for his &quot;More Bounce to the Ounce&quot; compilation CD. The band continued as a three-piece after Zack quit.

Their first full-length album, titled &quot;Shit Out of Luck&quot;, was released on Clearview Records in 1996. Following the release of their first album the band changed their lyrical focus. In 1999 they went into the studio with producer-engineer Mass Giorgini to record a new LP. This was done with the band&#x27;s own money, and without the benefit of a record label. The result was &quot;Death by Television&quot;, released on March 30, 1999, an album that took sci-fi movie-themed songs such as &quot;War Of The Worlds&quot; and &quot;Invasion Of The Saucermen&quot; and combined them with tracks that made references to other retro themes, such as &quot;X-Ray Specs.&quot; The recordings instantly created a buzz. Successful label Fat Wreck Chords offered to release the album, but the band had already accepted an offer. They signed with Panic Button Records, an imprint of influential punk label Lookout! Records that was overseen by Ben Weasel and John Jughead Pierson of Screeching Weasel fame.

The band spent the next two years touring heavily within the punk scene and disbanded after teaming with Giorgini for their final Panic Button/Lookout! release, the spy-themed LP &quot;The Backchannel Broadcast,&quot; which was released in February, 2001. The album included the song &quot;Wait It Out&quot;, written by Ben Weasel and later re-recorded by The Riverdales for their record &quot;Phase Three.&quot;

John Jughead (of Screeching Weasel and Even in Blackouts) filled in as second guitar on many tour stops on the &quot;Death by Television&quot; and &quot;Backchannel&quot; tours. Other notable appearances on these tours include Ben Weasel (at The Fireside in Chicago, his first stage appearance since 1995), and Lurch Nobody. Timmy V left the band after &quot;Death by Television&quot; and was replaced by Austin, Texas drummer Scott Holubec. The band played a one-off show with Even in Blackouts in March 2003. In May 2003, drummer Scott Holubec left the band, and was replaced by Brandon Carlisle of Teenage Bottlerocket. In August, the band announced they would be breaking up.

Red Scare Industries reissued &quot;Death by Television&quot; and &quot;Backchannel Broadcast&quot; in 2005. The band split for a few years before reuniting with all original members to release a new album, &quot;The Too Late Show&quot; in 2006 with no plans on reuniting for a tour to support due to the members&#x27; other commitments.

Templeman is currently a member of Laramie, Wyoming Punk rock band Teenage Bottlerocket. Drummer Timmy V was the touring drummer with Albuquerque, New Mexico all girl three-piece The Eyeliners, and plays drums in his own project Stabbed in Back, a punk rock band that is influenced by early DC bands.

The band reformed in 2013 to play Riot Fest, and played a few shows in the Northeast in 2014. In November 2015, the group supported The Queers for a couple of shows. In early January 2017, it was announced that the band was in the studio recording a new album. On April 13, it was announced that an EP, titled &quot;Project 313&quot;, would be released via Red Scare Industries on June 9. On June 20, 2017 the band announced that they had signed to Fat Wreck Chords. The label subsequently released their album &quot;Stella Sapiente&quot; that October.

<doc id="1259981" wikidata="Q2117760" url="?curid=1259981" title="Walter Gaitán">
<text>Walter Nicolás Gaitán Sayavedra (March 13, 1977) is a retired Argentine professional footballer.

An attacking midfielder, Gaitán was known for his vision on the pitch, passing, powerful left shot and a classy ball control. Nicknamed &quot;Chueco&quot;, Gaitán played his best seasons with Liga MX club Tigres UANL.

==Career==

===Argentina and Spain===
Walter Gaitán began his career in Argentina with Rosario Central in 1997. He left the team in 1998 and moved to Villarreal of the Spanish Liga. After two years in Spain, he returned to Argentina in early 2001, joining Boca Juniors by request of coach Carlos Bianchi. Gaitán became a regular substitute of Juan Román Riquelme. He scored an early goal in semifinals of the 2001 Copa Libertadores against Palmeiras at the Estádio Palestra Itália. Boca Juniors became the 2001 Copa Libertadores champions.

On September 16, 2001, in the &quot;Superclásico&quot; of the Apertura 2001 season, at 83&#x27; he scored the 1–1 tie against River Plate at the Estadio Monumental. He scored eight goals in 12 matches of the Apertura 2001 season. In 2002, now under Óscar Tabárez, he became a regular starter in League and Copa Libertadores 2002, but gradually lower his level and went to the bench by mid-2002. Gaitán finally left Boca Juniors with 14 goals in 51 matches.

===Mexico===
Gaitán moved to Mexico for the 2002 Apertura season, signing with Tigres UANL of the Primera División (First Division, now Liga MX) by request of Ricardo Ferretti. After scoring four goals in 15 games in his first season, he scored eight in the 2003 Clausura. Tigres was eliminated in semifinals of the Clausura 2003 playoffs by crosstown archrival Monterrey. After a remarkable Apertura 2003 season under coach Nery Pumpido, Gaitán and Tigres lost the finals against Pachuca in the Estadio Universitario. In the Apertura 2004, as revenge of the elimination on the Clausura 2003 playoffs, Tigres won the &quot;Clásico Regiomontano&quot; by the biggest difference ever, beating Monterrey by 6–2, he scored twice. Gaitán became the top goal-scorer of the 2005 Apertura. He was also named Best Player of the Clausura 2006 tournament.

He scored a goal in the 2–1 victory of Tigres over city rival Monterrey in the finals of the 2006 InterLiga and secured 2006 Copa Libertadores. He was selected to wear the number 7, retired to honor team icon Gerónimo Barbadillo, in Copa Libertadores where regulations command that the number be used. Gaitán scored a total of four goals in Copa Libertadores with Tigres. When Tigres qualified for the Copa Libertadores, he wore the shirt of Rosario Central at the celebration.

In October 2007, Gaitán, citing personal reasons, asked for a three-month license to be absent from the team until the end of the season. In December 2007, Club Necaxa announced the incorporation of Gaitán to the team, along with Omar Ortiz. Playing for Necaxa, he scored against Tigres and former archrival Monterrey. In 2010, Gaitán played briefly for Veracruz but was ceased due professional differences.

===United States===
In February 2011, Gaitán was officially introduced to the squad for the Los Angeles Blues of the USL Pro.

==Legacy==
Gaitán was nicknamed in Mexico as &quot;El Divino&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The Divine&quot;), due his gifted touch of the ball, vision and feel of the game. In Argentina, he was known as &quot;El Chueco&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The &quot;), for being left-footed. He is considered by Mexican media and fans as one of the greatest attacking midfielders ever to play in Mexico. Gaitán declined to play the 2006 World Cup with Mexico despite the call of then coach, Ricardo La Volpe.

Being a midfielder, he finished the Apertura 2005 season as the top goal scorer of Liga MX with 14 goals. He is one of the top scorers of the Clasico Regiomontano, with eight goals. Gaitán did not achieve the League championship with Tigres, still, he is considered by the media and audience as an icon of the team, next to players such as Tomás Boy, Gerónimo Barbadillo, Osvaldo Batocletti, Claudio Núñez, Lucas Lobos and André-Pierre Gignac.

<text>Moulton is a village and civil parish in the West Suffolk district of Suffolk in eastern England, located close to the town of Newmarket. It pre-dates the 1086 Domesday book and, in 2005, it was estimated to have a population of 1090. 1,033 people were recorded at the 2011 census.
The village is older than the now larger town of Newmarket and includes a 15th-century packhorse bridge spanning the River Kennett. This is one of two such bridges in Suffolk, with the other being located in the neighbouring village Kentford. The bridge is a grade II* listed structure 

Moulton also has a fine church, St. Peter&#x27;s, with an early 14th-century tower topped by a gilded weather vane in the shape of a large pike by blacksmith Charles Poulter. Restored in 1851, it is a grade I listed building.

==John Gower connection==
In August 1382 John Gower purchased the manors of Feltwell in Norfolk and Multon in Suffolk. They were then granted to Thomas Blakelake, parson of St. Nicholas, Feltwell, and others, at a rent of forty pounds annually for his life.

<text>Louis Lachenal (17 July 1921 – 25 November 1955), a French climber born in Annecy, Haute-Savoie, was one of the first two mountaineers to climb a summit of more than 8,000 meters. On 3 June 1950 on the 1950 French Annapurna expedition, along with Maurice Herzog, he reached the summit of Annapurna I in Nepal at a height of 8,091 m (26,545 ft). Previously he had made the second ascent of the North Face of the Eiger in 1947, with Lionel Terray. He died falling into a snow-covered crevasse while skiing the Vallee Blanche in Chamonix. The mountain Pointe Lachenal in the Mont Blanc massif was named after him.

<doc id="1259992" wikidata="Q7403385" url="?curid=1259992" title="Salad bowl (cultural idea)">
<text>A salad bowl or tossed salad is a metaphor for the way an intercultural society can integrate different cultures while maintaining their separate identities, contrasting with a melting pot, which emphasizes the combination of the parts into a single whole. In Canada this concept is more commonly known as the cultural mosaic or &quot;tossed salad&quot;.

In the salad bowl model, different cultures are brought together—like salad ingredients—but do not form together into a single homogeneous culture; each culture keeps its own distinct qualities. This idea proposes a society of many individual cultures, since the latter suggests that ethnic groups may be unable to preserve their heritage.

New York City can be considered a &quot;salad bowl&quot;. A European example is its policy for &quot;integration of non-European nationals&quot;, which finances and promotes integration initiatives targeting those who are not members of the European Union. This project aims to encourage dialogue in civil society, develop integration models, and spread and highlight the best initiatives regarding integration. 

The salad bowl idea in practice has its supporters and detractors. Supporters argue that being &quot;American&quot; does not inherently tie a person to a single culture, though rather to citizenship and loyalty to the United States. Thus, one does not need to abandon their cultural heritage in order to be considered &quot;American&quot;. Critics tend to oppose the idea in tandem with other critiques on multiculturalism, saying that America needs to have a &quot;common culture&quot; in order to preserve a common national identity.

<text>Freeze is the title of an art exhibition that took place in July 1988 in an empty London Port Authority building (the old fire station) at Surrey Docks in London Docklands. Its main organiser was Damien Hirst. It was significant in the subsequent development of the Young British Artists.

==Organisation==

&quot;Freeze&quot; was orchestrated by Damien Hirst, who was then a student at Goldsmiths College of Art. He was assisted by Luigi Scalera, a young architecture graduate working for the London Docklands Development Corporation, who identified and made available the derelict building for the exhibition together with modest funding for painting the interior. Hirst and his collaborators intentionally imitated the look of Charles Saatchi&#x27;s first gallery in St John&#x27;s Wood that had opened a few years earlier. Saatchi, an art collector, attended &quot;Freeze&quot; and purchased a piece of art by Mat Collishaw. Michael Craig-Martin, a tutor at Goldsmiths Art College, used his influence in the London art world to convince Norman Rosenthal and Nicholas Serota to visit the exhibition.

A show of work by Angus Fairhurst in February 1988 was the precursor to &quot;Freeze&quot;.
Fairhurst, along with other students from Goldsmiths College of Art, were instrumental in organizing &quot;Freeze&quot;. It was there that the work of the Young British Artists caught the attention of the collector Charles Saatchi.

The catalogue for &quot;Freeze&quot; had surprisingly high production values for a student exhibition. It was designed by Tony Arefin and included an essay by art critic Ian Jeffrey. The catalogue was funded by the property developers Olympia and York. The title of the show came from the catalogue&#x27;s description of Mat Collishaw&#x27;s macro photograph &quot;Bullet Hole&quot; which showed a gunshot wound to a human head (taken from a pathology textbook).

In 2007, Michael Craig-Martin said in an interview with Brian Sherwin:
:I had always tried to help my students in any way I could, particularly in those first years after art school. I knew from personal experience how difficult it was—I never had things come easy. I did the same with Damien and Freeze. I encouraged people to go and see the work. I would never have done this if I hadn&#x27;t believed the show was of exceptional interest—why waste people&#x27;s time? It amuses me that so many people think what happened was calculated and cleverly manipulated whereas in fact it was a combination of youthful bravado, innocence, fortunate timing, good luck, and, of course, good work.

The exhibition was sponsored by the London Docklands Development Corporation and Olympia and York.

==Legacy==
There was one contemporary review of the original exhibition written by Sacha Craddock, which appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

The success inspired a second exhibition several months later, &quot;Freeze 2&quot;, featuring some artists from the first exhibition and some new faces from other London art schools. The BBC filmed the exhibition and interviewed some contributors.

&quot;Freeze&quot; influenced a group of artists later to be identified as the Young British Artists (YBAs—often written yBas). The actual list of members in this art group remained fluid from project to project.

==Exhibitors==
Two younger artists turned down the chance to be in the exhibition. Dominic Denis was listed in catalogue but did not show work. The 16 students who did exhibit at &quot;Freeze&quot; were:

*Steven Adamson
*Angela Bulloch
*Mat Collishaw
*Ian Davenport
*Angus Fairhurst
*Anya Gallaccio
*Damien Hirst
*Gary Hume
*Michael Landy
*Abigail Lane
*Sarah Lucas
*Lala Meredith-Vula
*Richard Patterson

<text>Claudio Scimone (23 December 1934 – 6 September 2018) was an Italian conductor.

He was born in Padua, Italy and studied conducting with Dimitri Mitropoulos and Franco Ferrara. He established an international reputation as a conductor, as well as a composer. He revived many baroque and renaissance works. His discography includes over 150 titles, and he won numerous prizes, including the &quot;Grand Prix du Disque of the Académie Charles Cros.&quot;

Claudio Scimone was the founder of I Solisti Veneti (the ensemble with which most of his recordings were made) and at the time of his death was the honorary conductor of the Gulbenkian Orchestra in Lisbon, Portugal.

With the Philharmonia of London, he conducted the first recording of Muzio Clementi’s Symphonies.

Scimone led the world to discover the importance of Vivaldi&#x27;s theatrical works, beginning with the first modern performance of &quot;Orlando furioso&quot;, featuring Marilyn Horne and Victoria de Los Angeles.

In the reborn Fenice Claudio Scimone directed the first modern revival of the Venetian version of &quot;Maometto secondo&quot; by Rossini.

He also gave the modern premieres of &quot;Moses in Egypt&quot; and &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; by Rossini, and &quot;The Last Judgement&quot; by Salieri.

Claudio Scimone was awarded the title of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (the highest ranking honour of the Republic). He was also awarded an honorary law degree from the University of Padua.

<doc id="1260011" wikidata="Q970795" url="?curid=1260011" title="The Idiot (album)">
<text>The Idiot is the debut solo studio album by the American musician Iggy Pop, released on March 18, 1977, through RCA Records. It was produced by David Bowie and primarily recorded at the Château d&#x27;Hérouville in Hérouville, France. The album followed the break-up of Pop&#x27;s band the Stooges in 1974 and a period of drug addiction for both Pop and Bowie, after which the two moved to Europe in an effort to kick their addictions.

Described by Pop as &quot;a cross between James Brown and Kraftwerk&quot;, &quot;The Idiot&quot; marks a departure from the proto-punk of the Stooges to a more subdued, mechanical sound with electronic overtones. Recording for it began at the château in June 1976 and continued into July. Further sessions took place at Musicland Studios in Munich in August. Bowie composed most of the music and contributed a major portion of the instrumentation. Pop wrote most of the lyrics in response to the music Bowie was creating. The album&#x27;s title was taken from Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel of the same name, while Erich Heckel&#x27;s painting &quot;Roquairol&quot; inspired its artwork.

After the album was completed, Bowie began recording his next album &quot;Low&quot;, which features a sound similar to &quot;The Idiot&quot;. &quot;Low&quot; was released in January 1977 and was a commercial success, compelling RCA Records to release &quot;The Idiot&quot; two months later. Upon its release, the album received divided, albeit largely positive reviews from music critics, many of whom noted a change in musical tone from Pop&#x27;s earlier work with the Stooges. It charted in the US, the UK, and Australia. It was accompanied by the release of two singles, &quot;Sister Midnight&quot; and &quot;China Girl&quot;, in February and May 1977, respectively; Bowie later issued his own version of &quot;China Girl&quot; as a single in 1983.

Pop supported &quot;The Idiot&quot; with a tour in March and April 1977, with Bowie as his keyboardist. Afterward, the two collaborated again on Pop&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1977). Retrospectively, &quot;The Idiot&quot; has continued to be received positively, with many noting Pop&#x27;s artistic evolution. However, because Bowie largely created it, fans do not generally consider the album as being representative of Pop&#x27;s output. It has influenced post-punk, industrial, and gothic acts, including Joy Division.

==Background==
From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, Iggy Pop was the frontman of the proto-punk band the Stooges. He became known for his wild on-stage behavior and helped garner a cult following for the band. During their tenure, the band had little commercial success and almost all members, including Pop, suffered from drug addictions. In 1971, Pop met musician David Bowie and the two became friends. Bowie was hired to mix the band&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Raw Power&quot;. Soon after its release, the band broke up in 1974 because of infighting, lack of major label support, and Pop&#x27;s drug addiction, causing Pop and Bowie to stop collaborating. After the break-up, Pop recorded tracks with fellow Stooges member James Williamson, but these were not released until 1977 (as &quot;Kill City&quot;, credited jointly to Pop and Williamson). Pop tried to establish himself as a solo artist and auditioned to join other bands such as the Doors and Kiss, but these ventures were unsuccessful. Realizing his heroin addiction was destroying him, Pop checked himself into the Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of California in Los Angeles for help to get sober; Bowie was one of Pop&#x27;s few visitors during his stay. Pop recalled: &quot;Nobody else came... not even my so-called friends in LA. But David came.&quot; Pop and Bowie reunited in mid-1975 and attempted to record a few tracks, but both men were deep into their drug addictions, so the sessions were mostly unproductive. Bowie commented, &quot;He&#x27;ll never make it to the recording studios in time. Iggy&#x27;s doomed.&quot;

Pop&#x27;s stints in rehab in 1974 and 1976 were unsuccessful, and Bowie&#x27;s biographer, Thomas Jerome Seabrook, described Pop as reaching his &quot;lowest point&quot; in 1976. Knowing he had to become sober, Pop accepted an invitation to join Bowie on his 1976 Isolar Tour. By this point, Bowie also wanted to rid himself of his drug addiction. During the tour, Pop was impressed with Bowie&#x27;s work ethic, later stating that he learned all of his self-help techniques through Bowie on the tour. There were further talks of Pop recording a solo album with Bowie as producer. Bowie and the guitarist Carlos Alomar had written a new song, &quot;Sister Midnight&quot;, and offered it to Pop; Bowie occasionally performed it live on the tour. Toward the end of the tour, both Bowie and Pop knew they wanted to avoid the drug culture of Los Angeles, and decided to move to Europe. At its conclusion, Bowie was initially keen to produce &quot;Sister Midnight&quot; in Munich, Germany, for release as a single. After visiting the Château d&#x27;Hérouville in Hérouville, France, the same place Bowie recorded his 1973 album &quot;Pin Ups&quot;, he instead decided to produce an entire album for Pop there. Bowie booked two months of studio time at the château for later in the summer of 1976.

==Recording==
Bowie and Pop arrived at Château d&#x27;Hérouville in June 1976 to record an album. Bowie bonded with the studio&#x27;s new owner, Laurent Thibault, the former bassist of the French band Magma, and asked him to play bass and act as engineer; Thibault hired the Frenchman Michel Santangeli to play drums. Bowie began composing tracks that ended up on &quot;The Idiot&quot; on keyboard and guitar. After Santangeli&#x27;s arrival, Bowie played the tracks for him using a Baldwin electric piano. For two days, with minimal guidance, Santangeli played to the rough tracks (which he assumed were demos), the first takes often becoming part of the final mix. Bowie dismissed Santangeli at the end of the second day, leading him to believe his playing was inadequate, and he would not appear on the album; Santangeli later expressed regret over the final drum sound. Subsequently, Bowie began adding guitar parts. Overall, Bowie contributed guitar, electric piano, synthesizer, saxophone, and backing vocals to the album.

After the backing tracks were composited with guitar, keyboards, and drums, Bowie had Thibault add bass to them with little guidance. In July 1976, Bowie brought in his own rhythm section consisting of the bassist George Murray and the drummer Dennis Davis to provide overdubs on a few tracks, including &quot;Sister Midnight&quot; and &quot;Mass Production&quot;. While Bowie composed much of the music for &quot;The Idiot&quot;, Pop wrote most of the lyrics on the studio floor, often in response to the music Bowie was composing. Pop was also keen to improvise some of his lyrics while standing next to the microphone, something that fascinated Bowie, who later used this method when recording &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; (1977).

Recording continued in August 1976 at Musicland Studios in Munich, which was owned by Bowie&#x27;s future collaborator, the electronic dance music producer Giorgio Moroder. Here, Pop recorded most of his vocals, along with additional guitar overdubs provided by the guitarist Phil Palmer who, like Santangeli and Thibault, re-recorded some of Bowie&#x27;s guitar parts with little guidance. Palmer described the creative collaboration with Pop and Bowie as &quot;vampiric&quot; because he never saw the artists during the daytime and the collaboration was stimulating but disquieting. Bowie&#x27;s original choice for guitarist was former King Crimson member Robert Fripp, who later worked with him on &quot;Heroes&quot;. The last track recorded for &quot;The Idiot&quot; was &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; with Bowie playing the melody on piano using an old drum machine for backing. When Pop pronounced himself happy with the result, Bowie protested they needed real drums to finish it. Pop insisted on keeping the drum machine, saying &quot;it kicks ass, it&#x27;s better than a drummer&quot;.

When recording was completed, Bowie and Pop traveled to Berlin to mix the album at Hansa Studio 1 (not, as is often incorrectly reported, the bigger Studio 2 by the Berlin Wall). Because his former producer Tony Visconti was already in line to co-produce Bowie&#x27;s next album, Bowie called upon him to help mix the record, so as to familiarize him with Bowie&#x27;s new way of working. Given the almost demo quality of the tapes, the post-production work was, in Visconti&#x27;s words, &quot;more of a salvage job than a creative mixing&quot;.

==Styles and themes==
&quot;The Idiot&quot; marks a drastic departure for Pop from the aggressive proto-punk sound of the Stooges, reflecting a more subdued, inward-looking sound featuring elements such as &quot;fragmented guitar figures, ominous basslines, and discordant, high-relief keyboard parts&quot; as well as his &quot;world-weary baritone.&quot; At the time of its release, Pop described &quot;The Idiot&quot; as &quot;a cross between James Brown and Kraftwerk&quot;. Retrospectively, commentators have categorized &quot;The Idiot&quot; primarily as art rock, but have also noted the presence of gothic rock, industrial rock, with the album described as &quot;totally out of step&quot; with the punk sound birthed by the Stooges and credited with having &quot;invented&quot; post-punk. In 1981, &quot;NME&quot; editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray suggested that &quot;The Idiot&quot;″s electronic sound had been &quot;pioneered&quot; on Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Low&quot; (1977), whereas in 2016, Nicholas Pegg described it as &quot;a stepping stone between Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Station to Station&quot; and &quot;Low&quot;&quot;. According to the critic Simon Reynolds, the album&#x27;s &quot;mechanistic grooves, brittle drums and harsh guitar textures&quot; anticipated Bowie&#x27;s Berlin Trilogy and allowed Bowie to explore his fascination with German electronic sounds inspired by Neu! and Cluster. Wesley Strick of &quot;Circus&quot; magazine described the music as &quot;mechanized&quot;, similar to Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Fame&quot;, but &quot;with rhythms keyed off a quickened pulse&quot;, while &quot;Creem&quot; Richard Riegel called it &quot;professional studio metal, with occasional German-electronic overtones&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;″s Nick Kent described the music as &quot;totally rivetted and fettered to a thoroughly unhealthy aroma of evil and twilight zone zombie-time unease&quot;. Bowie biographer David Buckley called &quot;The Idiot&quot; &quot;a funky, robotic Hellhole of an album&quot;.

===Side one===

&quot;Sister Midnight&quot; is similar to the funk style of Bowie&#x27;s tracks &quot;Fame&quot; and &quot;Stay&quot;, described by Seabrook and O&#x27;Leary as the song most representative of Bowie&#x27;s pre-Berlin period. Its lack of overtly electronic instrumentation belied what the critic Dave Thompson described as a &quot;defiantly futuristic ambience&quot;. Bowie wrote the first lyrics of the opening verse of &quot;Sister Midnight&quot; while on tour; Pop completed them in the studio. Reviewers have compared Pop&#x27;s vocal performance to Jim Morrison of the Doors. The author Peter Doggett writes the identity of &quot;Sister Midnight&quot; is irrelevant, explaining that &quot;she was merely a cipher, who could send [Pop] soaring to the moon or falling to Earth... without either journey seeming to register on his emotions&quot;. The Krautrock-influenced &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; is considered a forerunner to what Bowie would explore on &quot;Low&quot;. The riff has been described as a mischievous take on Gary Glitter&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;. Kris Needs described it as &quot;the bleak sound of the 1985 disco, as ghostly electronic washes sky-write phrases over an unsettling, distorted disco pulse&quot;. Lyrically, Pop described &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; as &quot;my comment on what it was like hanging out with him every night&quot; and &quot;about the incredible coldness and deathly feeling you have after you&#x27;ve done something like that and how much you enjoy it. It could be Los Angeles or Paris or New York or anywhere, really.&quot;

Originally titled &quot;Fun Fun Fun&quot;, Hugo Wilcken describes &quot;Funtime&quot; as a &quot;proto-gothic number&quot;. Pegg writes that the guitar and drum sounds exhibit Bowie&#x27;s interest in German bands such as Neu! Some reviewers have compared the song&#x27;s style to the Velvet Underground. For the track, Bowie advised Pop to sing &quot;like Mae West, like a bitch who wants to make money&quot;. Lyrically, the song evokes both Bowie and Pop&#x27;s final days living in Los Angeles, with lines like &quot;talkin&#x27; to Dracula and his crew&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s backing vocals were mixed almost as high as Pop&#x27;s lead ones. Pop called it his &quot;love song&quot; in 1977. &quot;Baby&quot; is primarily led by bass and synthesizer rather than drums. While it is German influenced, Seabrook considers the song more cabaret and less Krautrock. Lyrically, it is about a relationship that is soon to fail. Unlike the next track, Pop cautions the listener to &quot;stay clean, stay young, and not cry, because he&#x27;s already done it all&quot;. Originally called &quot;Borderline&quot;, &quot;China Girl&quot; is the most upbeat track on the album. The song is led primarily by a distorted guitar and synthesizer. Production-wise, it is raw and unpolished compared to Bowie&#x27;s 1983 remake. It is a tale of unrequited love inspired by Kuelan Nguyen, partner of French actor-singer Jacques Higelin, who was also recording at the château at the same time. The protagonist&#x27;s &quot;Shhh...&quot; was a direct quote from Nguyen after Pop confessed his feelings for her one night. Pop improvised most of the lyrics while standing at a studio microphone.

===Side two===
In 1997, Pop explained the origins of &quot;Dum Dum Boys&quot;: &quot;I only had a few notes on the piano, I couldn&#x27;t quite finish the tune. Bowie said, &#x27;Don&#x27;t you think we could make a song with that? Why don&#x27;t you tell the story of the Stooges?&#x27; He gave me the concept of the song and... the title&quot;, originally &quot;Dum Dum Days&quot;. Likewise a tribute/lament for Pop&#x27;s former Stooges bandmates, the spoken intro references Zeke Zettner, Dave Alexander, Scott Asheton, and Williamson. O&#x27;Leary considers it Pop&#x27;s equivalent to Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. Musically, Seabrook compares it to the Stooges&#x27; &quot;Fun House&quot; (1970). Bowie originally played all the guitar parts himself, but feeling his playing was subpar, he ultimately had Palmer overdub some parts.

&quot;Tiny Girls&quot;, sequenced between the two longest tracks on &quot;The Idiot&quot;, is reminiscent of a 1950s doo-wop number. Lyrically, Pop&#x27;s ideal is getting a &quot;tiny girl&quot; with &quot;no past&quot; and &quot;no tricks&quot;. Both Pegg and Seabrook consider Bowie&#x27;s saxophone performance on the track one of his finest. The final track, &quot;Mass Production&quot;, is an eight-minute epic. Seabrook compares it to the Stooges&#x27; &quot;Dirt&quot; and Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Station to Station&quot;. Wilcken describes the song as a harsh, grinding piece of early industrial electronica. It begins with a minute of &quot;proto-industrial noises&quot;, created by Thibault using tape loops. Bowie suggested the lyrics to Pop, who later recalled: &quot;He just said, &#x27;I want you to write a song about mass production, because I would always talk to him about how much I admired the beauty of the American industrial culture that was rotting away where I grew up.&quot;

==Release and promotion==
The title of &quot;The Idiot&quot; was taken from Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel of the same name which Bowie, Pop, and Visconti were all familiar with. In a 1985 interview, Pop said Bowie was the one who titled it. Pop knew it was a reference to the novel but also felt his friend was simply insulting him. Erich Heckel&#x27;s painting &quot;Roquairol&quot; inspired the album&#x27;s cover photo. It is a black-and-white flopped image photograph taken by photographer Andy Kent, it depicts Pop striking what Pegg calls a &quot;tortured, stiff-limbed pose&quot; based on the figure in the painting. Bowie would later use the same painting as inspiration for the cover artwork for &quot;Heroes&quot;.

Although Pop completed &quot;The Idiot&quot; by August 1976, Bowie wanted to be sure he had his own album in stores before the release. Thibault opined that &quot;[Bowie] didn&#x27;t want people to think he&#x27;d been inspired by Iggy&#x27;s album, when in fact it was all the same thing&quot;. Bowie recorded &quot;Low&quot; between September and October, and released through RCA Records in January 1977. Because &quot;Low&quot; had a sound similar to &quot;The Idiot&quot;, the label feared it would not sell well. Nevertheless, the former and its first single &quot;Sound and Vision&quot; were commercial successes. The success of &quot;Sound and Vision&quot; allowed Bowie to persuade RCA to release &quot;The Idiot&quot;, which they did on March 18, 1977. &quot;The Idiot&quot; peaked at number 72 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, spending 13 weeks on the chart. It also spent three weeks on the UK Albums Chart, reaching number 30, marking Pop&#x27;s first top 40 album. It also peaked at number 88 on the Kent Music Report in Australia. RCA released the singles &quot;Sister Midnight&quot; and &quot;China Girl&quot; in February and May 1977, respectively; both had the same B-side—&quot;Baby&quot;, and failed to chart.

Although RCA was hoping he would tour to support &quot;Low&quot;, Bowie opted instead to further support Pop on his own tour. With Bowie playing keyboards, he assembled a band that included Ricky Gardiner on guitar, with brothers and future Tin Machine bandmates Tony Fox and Hunt Sales on bass and drums, respectively. Rehearsals for The Idiot tour began in mid-February 1977 and, according to Gardiner, went very well. He said Bowie was fine with restricting his involvement, not appearing to &quot;undermine&quot; Pop at all. The tour, Pop&#x27;s first since the demise of the Stooges, began on March 1. The opening act was American rock band Blondie, who Bowie and Pop invited after the pair heard the band&#x27;s 1976 debut album. Songs played included popular Stooges numbers, a couple of tracks from &quot;The Idiot&quot;, and songs that would appear on Pop&#x27;s follow-up &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1977). Bowie was adamant about not taking the spotlight away from Pop, often staying behind his keyboard and not addressing the audience; Giovanni Dadomo of &quot;Sounds&quot; reported, &quot;If you wanted David, you also got the band.&quot; Pop&#x27;s stage presence was praised, although some, including Nick Kent, believed that Bowie was still in charge. The tour lasted until April 16, 1977. &quot;The Idiot&quot; and his subsequent tour earned Pop greater fame and success than he had ever achieved with the Stooges. However, during interviews, he was often asked about Bowie more than his own work. As a result, Pop took a more direct approach when making &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, resulting in a sound more reminiscent of his earlier work.

== Critical reception ==
Critical reception to &quot;The Idiot&quot; was largely positive, although it did confuse a number of reviewers. Doggett writes that listeners&#x27; perceptions of Pop generally influenced their views on the record. In a contemporary review of the album, John Swenson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; termed it &quot;the most savage indictment of rock posturing ever recorded&quot; and &quot;a necrophiliac&#x27;s delight&quot;. In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Allan Jones praised the record as a &quot;disturbingly pertinent expression of modern music&quot;. Strick positively compared &quot;The Idiot&quot; to Pop&#x27;s prior work with the Stooges, noting the difference in his vocal performance: &quot;[He] doesn&#x27;t sound alive... he sounds automated.&quot; He further complimented Pop&#x27;s lyricism, stating, &quot;Iggy&#x27;s got the tainted charisma of a dead poet.&quot; Like Strick, Riegel noted the difference in &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;Raw Power&quot;, writing: &quot;Where &quot;Raw Power&quot; represented the final apotheosis of the Detroit-metal rock band, &quot;The Idiot&quot; puts Iggy right out in front as a kind of rarefied, continent-seasoned singer-songwriter.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine noted the &quot;less frantic&quot; pace of Pop&#x27;s earlier efforts and found Bowie&#x27;s parts make the record more &quot;commercially palatable&quot;. In their year-end list, &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine placed &quot;The Idiot&quot; at number 12.

Similar to other reviewers, Kris Needs of &quot;ZigZag&quot; magazine was perplexed upon hearing &quot;The Idiot&quot; for the first time, noting the major difference between it and Pop&#x27;s work with the Stooges. Calling it &quot;a very strange, morbid, obscure and unsettling [album]&quot;, Needs praised the record, stating he listened to it on repeat for hours at a time, and it &quot;chill[ed] [him] to the marrow&quot;. John Rockwell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a powerful record&quot;, describing Pop&#x27;s vocals as a blend of Morrison and Lou Reed and Bowie&#x27;s music as &quot;Germano‐British progressivisms&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; Jim Evans found &quot;little emotion&quot; in Pop&#x27;s vocal performances but considered the music innovative and compulsive, particularly on side two, which he deemed borderline heavy metal. In a more mixed review, Stephen Demorest of &quot;Phonograph Record&quot; said he enjoyed the record, due to its &quot;completely schizophrenic&quot; nature. He called &quot;China Girl&quot; the highlight of the album, but felt other tracks were not among Pop&#x27;s finest: &quot;It&#x27;s a mixture of bluff... and beauty.&quot;

Retrospective reviews have been largely positive, with many noting Pop&#x27;s artistic evolution. Mark Deming of AllMusic praised the record, writing that &quot;The Idiot&quot; showcased a different side of Pop that had yet to be seen, and if fans at the time were expecting &quot;Raw Power 2.0&quot;, it &quot;made it clear&quot; that Pop had evolved: &quot;it&#x27;s a flawed but powerful and emotionally absorbing work.&quot; The biographer Paul Trynka writes that over time, &quot;The Idiot&quot; would be classified as an album that was &quot;more respected than loved&quot;, but acknowledged its influence on the &quot;soul&quot; of post-punk. Writing for &quot;Clash&quot; magazine on the record&#x27;s 35th anniversary, Amanda Arber stated: &quot;&quot;The Idiot&quot; stands as a dark, dense and desolate display of an artist confronting his demons head-on, and growing up in the process. It was bleakly revolutionary then, and it is now.&quot; Reviewing the album as part of the 2020 box set &quot;The Bowie Years&quot;, Sasha Geffen of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; praised it, stating: &quot;&quot;The Idiot&quot; may lack fury, but it compensates with sardonic humor and perfectly tuned melodrama – both tools that would become wildly popular across all artistic media in the 1980s.&quot;

== Influence and legacy ==

Although reviewers consider &quot;The Idiot&quot; good in its own right, Pop&#x27;s fans have criticized the album as unrepresentative of his repertoire and as evidence of his being &quot;co-opted&quot; by Bowie for the latter&#x27;s own ends. In his contemporary review of the record, Riegel comments, &quot;As the star of &quot;The Idiot&quot;... Iggy Pop seems more under David Bowie&#x27;s manipulative thumb than ever before, a condition that can be taken as positive or negative.&quot; Furthermore, Jones described it as his &quot;second favorite David Bowie album&quot;. When reviewing &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, Pete Makowski of &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine felt &quot;The Idiot&quot; suffered from &quot;being a part of Bowie&#x27;s come down,&quot; calling it &quot;a &quot;Low&quot; disco platter&quot;. O&#x27;Leary considers &quot;The Idiot&quot; a Bowie album just as much as a Pop one. Although Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot; is said to consist of &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;Heroes&quot;, and &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979), O&#x27;Leary argues the true &quot;Berlin Trilogy&quot; consists of &quot;The Idiot&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, and &quot;Heroes&quot;, with &quot;Lust for Life&quot; a &quot;supplement&quot; and &quot;Lodger&quot; an &quot;epilogue&quot;. Bowie himself later admitted:


Bowie later re-worked &quot;Sister Midnight&quot; with new lyrics as &quot;Red Money&quot; on &quot;Lodger&quot;, while his version of &quot;China Girl&quot; on &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance&quot; (1983) became a major hit.

Siouxsie Sioux of Siouxsie and the Banshees described &quot;The Idiot&quot; as a &quot;re-affirmation that our suspicions were true – the man was a genius and what a voice! The sound and production is so direct and uncompromised.&quot; The album has been cited as a major influence on post-punk, industrial, and gothic rock artists, including Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, and Joy Division. uDiscoverMusic&#x27;s Tim Peacock later argued &quot;The Idiot&quot; invented post-punk. The album particularly influenced Joy Division, who formed in the months between the releases of &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;The Idiot&quot;. Their debut album &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; (1979) drew heavily on the &quot;industrial soundscapes&quot; and &quot;relentless percussion&quot; of tracks like &quot;Nightclubbing&quot; and &quot;Mass Production&quot;, also noting that &quot;The Idiot&quot; was still playing on the turntable of the band&#x27;s singer Ian Curtis when he was found having died by suicide in 1980.

In addition, Seabrook cites &quot;Mass Production&quot; as an influence on modern alternative rock acts like the Smashing Pumpkins and Radiohead. In 2011, Killing Joke&#x27;s Youth described &quot;The Idiot&quot; as one of his 13 favorite albums. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; later ranked &quot;The Idiot&quot; number 96 in its list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1970s in 2004. The album was also included in the 2018 edition of Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

===2020 deluxe edition===
On April 10, 2020, Pop released an alternate mix of &quot;China Girl&quot; to promote the forthcoming release of &quot;The Bowie Years&quot;, a seven-disc deluxe box set featuring expanded remastered versions of &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;Lust for Life&quot;. The box set, released on May 29, includes remastered versions of both albums along with outtakes, alternate mixes, and a 40-page booklet. The two original albums were also re-released individually, each paired with an additional album of live material to create separate stand-alone two-disc deluxe editions.

<text>Power Man and Iron Fist (originally Luke Cage, Hero for Hire then Luke Cage, Power Man) was an American comic book series published by Marvel Comics, featuring the superheroes Power Man and Iron Fist.

==Publication history==

===&quot;Hero for Hire&quot;/&quot;Power Man&quot;===
The series debuted as &quot;Hero for Hire&quot; #1, and became &quot;Power Man&quot; from #17 onwards. The cover logo included Luke Cage&#x27;s name, so from #1–16 the cover logo read &quot;Luke Cage, Hero for Hire&quot; and from #17 onwards &quot;Luke Cage, Power Man&quot;. The series was initially written by Luke Cage&#x27;s co-creator Archie Goodwin, pencilled by George Tuska, and inked by Billy Graham.

===&quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot;===
When &quot;Power Man&quot;″s sales became unsustainable, Marvel added Iron Fist, another once popular superhero who could no longer support his own series, in order to save both characters from full cancellation. Iron Fist joined the cast of &quot;Power Man&quot; in a three-part story arc in #48–50. The series title changed to &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; with #50, though the indicia did not reflect this change until #67.

&quot;Iron Fist&quot; writer Chris Claremont penned the initial stories pairing the characters, but was soon forced to turn the series over to Jo Duffy due to his unmanageable workload. Duffy&#x27;s run was noted for its lighthearted, humorous, character-driven tone, and had relatively few fight scenes. A young Kurt Busiek had his first regular assignment with the title, writing it from issue #90 to #100. He emulated the lighthearted humor of Duffy&#x27;s run, not knowing that Duffy had been taken off &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; precisely because the editorial staff disapproved of her lighthearted tongue-in-cheek approach to the series.

Goodwin then returned to the series, but had difficulty keeping up with the work, and his brief second run was littered with issues by fill-in writers, including two by Busiek. Jim Owsley, another Marvel staffer, took over as regular writer. The series concluded with the death of Iron Fist in #125, a controversial story. Owsley later commented, &quot;Fist’s death was senseless and shocking and completely unforeseen. It took the readers’ heads clean off. And, to this day, people are mad about it. Forgetting, it seems, that (a) you were supposed to be mad, that death is senseless and Fist’s death was supposed to be senseless, or that (b) this is a comic book.&quot;

===&quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; revivals===
&quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; returned as a five-issue limited series in 2011, spinning-off from the &quot;Shadowland&quot; storyline, which introduced a new Power Man, Victor Alvarez. It was written by one of the character&#x27;s creators Fred Van Lente, with art by Wellinton Alves. It returned again in 2016, with Luke Cage replacing Alvarez.

<text>The Sanctuary Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady (), commonly known as the Rotunda of Mosta () or the Mosta Dome, is a Roman Catholic parish church and basilica in Mosta, Malta, dedicated to the Assumption of Mary. It was built between 1833 and the 1860s to neoclassical designs of Giorgio Grognet de Vassé, on the site of an earlier Renaissance church which had been built around 1614 to designs of Tommaso Dingli.

The design of the present church is based on the Pantheon in Rome, has the third-largest unsupported dome in the world, and is Malta&#x27;s largest and most famous church. The church narrowly avoided destruction during World War II when on 9 April 1942 a German aerial bomb pierced the dome and fell into the church during Mass, but failed to explode. This event was interpreted by the Maltese as a miracle. 

==History==
Although Pietro Dusina recorded Mosta as a parish in his 1575 pastoral visit, the town actually became a parish in 1608. Plans to construct a new church began soon afterwards, and the church was built in around 1614 to designs attributed to the Renaissance architect Tommaso Dingli. This church was commonly called &quot;Ta&#x27; Ziri&quot;.

By the 1830s, the town&#x27;s population had become too big for this church to cater to. Giorgio Grognet de Vassé proposed rebuilding the church on a neoclassical design based on the Pantheon in Rome. Despite opposition from Bishop Francesco Saverio Caruana, the design was approved, and construction of the church began on 30 May 1833.
The new church was built around the old church, which remained in use throughout the course of construction. The residents of Mosta helped in building the church, taking part in construction work on Sundays and public holidays. Since Grognet had never received any formal architectural training, he received consultation services from an architect of the Sammut family.

The rotunda took 28 years to build, being completed in the early 1860s. The old church was demolished in 1860, and the new church did not need to be consecrated since the site had remained a place of worship throughout the course of construction. The church was officially dedicated on 15 October 1871.

During World War II, the town of Mosta was prone to aerial bombardment due to its proximity to the airfield of RAF Ta Kali. At about 16:40 on 9 April 1942, the Luftwaffe dropped three bombs on the church, and two of them deflected without exploding. However, one high-explosive bomb pierced the dome and entered the church, where a congregation of 300 people was awaiting early evening Mass. The bomb did not explode, and a Royal Engineers Bomb Disposal unit defused it and dumped it into the sea off the west coast of Malta. This event was interpreted as a miracle by the inhabitants, and a replica of the German bombshell is now displayed in the sacristy at the back of the church, under the words &quot;Il-Miraklu tal-Bomba, 9 ta&#x27; April 1942&quot; (meaning &quot;The Bomb Miracle, 9 April 1942&quot;).

On 12 December 1973, Pope Paul VI issued a decree of canonical coronation of the titular painting of Our Lady of the Assumption that was crowned later on 10 August 1975, thereby elevating the church to the title of Marian Sanctuary.

On 2 May 1983, taxi driver Carmelo Aquilina voluntarily drove a Mercedes car into the Rotunda following a bet. He drove up the steps of the parvis, broke down the main doorway, and stopped within the church close to the altar. Following the incident, Aquilina was arrested and received a three-month prison sentence while his driving licence was suspended.

In 2015, the parish requested to the Vatican to be reclassified to the status of a basilica. The church was elevated to a minor basilica on 29 July 2018 by decree of Pope Francis.

==Architecture==
The Rotunda of Mosta is built in the neoclassical style, and its structure is based on the Pantheon in Rome. Its façade has a portico with six Ionic columns, which is flanked by two bell towers. Being a rotunda, the church has a circular plan with walls about thick supporting a dome with an internal diameter of . At one time, the dome was the third-largest in the world. The church&#x27;s interior contains eight niches, including a bay containing the main entrance and a deep apse with the main altar.

Before the church was constructed, there was some opposition to Grognet&#x27;s design, since some regarded a Roman temple as an unsuitable model for a Catholic church building. However, others praised the design, and an 1839 book written while the church was being built describes it as &quot;certainly the most magnificent, extensive and solid modern building&quot; in Malta. This book further states that &quot;when finished, [the church] will be an ornament to the Island, will immortalize the architect, and draw towards the casal every visitor to Malta.&quot; The design was well-received upon completion, and it is regarded as Grognet&#x27;s masterpiece.

<text>Adolf Pokorny (born 25 July 1895 in Vienna, Austria, d. unknown) was an Austrian dermatologist and aspiring Nazi. In the 1947 Doctors&#x27; Trial he was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity for involuntary sterilization experiments on concentration camp prisoners, but he was acquitted.

==Early years==

His father was a lieutenant colonel in the Austro-Hungarian army, and was frequently transferred to different countries in Eastern Europe; the family moved with him.

==World War I and interwar period==

Pokorny was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army and served from March 1915 to September 1918 in the First World War. 

He completed his medical doctorate on 22 March 1922 and received his medical license. After two years of clinical training, he opened a practice in Komotau.

His application to join the Nazi Party was declined in 1939, because he was married to a Jewish physician, Dr. Lilly Weil, with whom he had two children and from whom he had been divorced in April 1935. While the children survived the war in the UK, Lilly Pokorná as an internee in Ghetto Terezin led the first radiology station in the camp. After the war, she emigrated with the children to Brazil.

During World War II, Pokorny worked as a medical officer of the German Armed Forces. Despite not being a member of the SS or the Nazi Party, Pokorny wrote to Heinrich Himmler to suggest sterilization of Russian prisoners of war utilizing the sap of the caladium plant, which, according to an article in a medical journal, was thought to cause sterilization in mice. Pokorny suggests the forced, covert sterilization of millions of prisoners, and wrote that he was &quot;led by the idea that the enemy must not only be conquered but destroyed&quot; (emphasis in original) and the immense importance of this drug &quot;in the present fight of our people.&quot; He continued:

This was received by Himmler with great interest, who ordered the procurement of caladium seguinum with the intention of conducting sterilization experiments on prisoners in Dachau concentration camp.

== Doctors&#x27; Trial ==
Pokorny was tried by the American Military Tribunal No. I (also known as the Doctors&#x27; Trial) in August 1947. Despite his letter to Himmler and the proof that forced sterilization experiments using caladium seguinum were conducted in the camps, Pokorny was found to have had no direct involvement in compulsory sterilization experiments, and was acquitted.

<text>Hengyang (; ) is the second largest city of Hunan Province, China. It straddles the Xiang River about south of the provincial capital of Changsha. As of the 2020 Chinese census, Its total population was 6,645,243 inhabitants, of whom 1,290,715 lived in the built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area consisting of 4 urban districts, Nanyue District not being conurbated yet.

Hengyang is home to University of South China, Hengyang Normal University, and Hunan Institute of Technology, three major provincial public universities in the city.

==History==

The former name of the city was Hengzhou (Hengchow) (). This was the capital of a prefecture in the Tang dynasty&#x27;s Jiangnan and West Jiangnan circuits. Li Jingxuan was banished to superintendence of Hengzhou after feigning an illness and attempting to usurp control of the legislative bureau at Chang&#x27;an against the Gaozong Emperor&#x27;s wishes in AD 680. Following the AD 705 coup that removed the Empress Wu Zetian from power, her ally Li Jiongxiu was also briefly demoted to superintendence of this province. During the reign of Emperor Muzong, the chancellor Linghu Chu was also demoted to this province for his underlings&#x27; alleged corruption.

In the 750s, the superintendent of Hengzhou Chen Xi&#x27;ang not only ruled his own region but also used his private army to dominate his nominal superior, the military governor Zhang Weiyi headquartered in Jing Prefecture (modern Jingzhou). Upon Zhang&#x27;s replacement by the former chancellor Lü Yin in 760, however, Chen was placated and then killed in a surprise attack.

During the reign of the Tang emperor Xizong, Zhou Yue overthrew first the prefect of Hengzhou Xu Hao in 881 and then the agent of the rebel Qin Zongquan in the capital of the Qinhua Circuit at Tan Prefecture (modern Changsha) in 886. Xizong confirmed Zhou Yue in all his posts, renaming his circuit Wu&#x27;an. Xizong&#x27;s brother then gave him additional authority over West Lingnan Circuit (modern Guangxi). Shortly after, in 893, Deng Chune and Lei Man attacked and killed him.

Other superintendents included Qi Ying and Xiao Ye.

After initially falling to agrarian rebels under Yang Shiyuan, Hengzhou was recovered by the lord of Wu&#x27;an Ma Yin and formed part of his power base during the collapse of the Tang. He initially supported the Later Liang, then declared himself king (Ma Chu) in his own right during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.

During the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, Wu Sangui declared himself Emperor of the Great Zhou and established an imperial court at Hengzhou in 1678 before dying of illness later that year. His grandson Wu Shifan then retreated to Yunnan, and the Qing recovered Hengzhou the next year.

The Battle of Hengyang was the longest defense of a single city during the Second Sino-Japanese War. When Changsha fell to the Imperial Japanese Army on June 19, 1944, Hengyang became their next target. The reorganized 11th Army, consisting of 10 divisions, four brigades, and over 110,000 men, assumed the task of attacking Hengyang. It was part of the Japanese Ichi-Go offensive.

A Roman Catholic diocese of Hengzhou was established, although periodically suppressed. This was suffragan to the Archbishop of Changsha following its elevation in 1946.

In 2013 Hengyang was the center of a major vote buying scandal where it was found that 56 officials were founded to be complicit in paying lower level local officials for votes. The 56 were subsequently removed from office, and an additional 512 resigned from their positions.

The city was badly damaged during World War II and few historical buildings survive in diverse stage of reconstruction, including Shigu Academy, Dragon Tower, Confucian School on the Dongzhou Island (), Laiyan Pagoda and Nantai Temple.

As of the 2020 census the CDP population was 81, while population estimates for the surrounding area range from about 600 to about 900 people.

Within Nicasio and the surrounding area are about 250 homes located on approximately 350 parcels. Much of the land is still used for agricultural purposes including beef and dairy cattle grazing, small-scale truck farming (including organic farming), and the raising of forage. Several small vineyards have also been recently established. Next to Rancho Nicasio within the town of Nicasio is an organic farm, AllStar Organics, owned and operated by Janet Brown and Marty Jacobson; Janet is the vice-president of Marin Organic, Marin County&#x27;s non-profit organic association. Just north of Nicasio Reservoir is Fairlea Ranch, where pedigree longhorn cattle are raised. The most significant non-agricultural business within Nicasio is George Lucas&#x27; Skywalker Ranch, a part of Lucasfilm Ltd. According to a 2004 &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine real estate survey, Nicasio is the 23rd most expensive ZIP code in the US. Nicasio has the highest per capita income ($211,993) of any census-designated place in California.

Centrally located in this area is the small village of Nicasio itself. The village is in area codes 415/628. The town center has a post office (ZIP code 94946), a general store, a tiny real estate office, St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church (established in 1867), Nicasio Volunteer Fire Department, a baseball field located in the town square, the Rancho Nicasio Bar &amp; Restaurant, a Druid&#x27;s Hall, as well as a number of private homes. The town was founded in the early 19th century to support local agricultural, timber, and fishing activities. The town once contained the twenty-two-room Hotel Nicasio, which opened in 1867 but burned down in December 1940. Just north of town on Nicasio Valley Road next to the modern-day school building for Nicasio School District is a one-room schoolhouse that opened in 1871. The building is currently a listed historical landmark. The Nicasio post office opened in 1871, closed in 1899, and reopened in 1900.

In 2008, Dewey Livingston wrote a detailed history of the region titled &quot;Nicasio: The Historic Valley at the Center of Marin&quot;.

== Geography ==
The Nicasio region is a hydrologic zone containing the four main drainages of Nicasio Creek up to the ridgelines defining their basin. It includes the south fork of Nicasio Creek extending from Moon Hill, along the ridge separating Nicasio from San Geronimo and Samuel P. Taylor State Park, and extending northwest towards the northern end of Platform Bridge Road; the east fork (Lucas Valley fork) of Nicasio Creek extending from Loma Alta and the ridge on the north side of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard, extending up through Big Rock and up towards Big Rock Ridge; the Halleck Creek drainage, up to the ridges separating Nicasio from Novato; the northern drainages extending along the ridgelines of Rocky Ridge, Hicks Mountain and Black Mountain.

A major landmark in the area is the man-made Nicasio Reservoir. Nicasio is surrounded by forested and open ridge lines surrounding a wide rolling valley. The area along Lucas Valley Road follows a narrow valley with mostly forested hillsides above it. Oak, bay, and fir trees are common in the area, and along some of the creeks stands of redwoods are still found. Wildlife is abundant; the Nicasio chickadee, a subspecies of the chestnut-backed chickadee, was named by Robert Ridgway. Three main roads cross the area: Lucas Valley Road, Nicasio Valley Road, and the Point Reyes-Petaluma Road. Important pieces of public land in the surrounding area include Point Reyes National Seashore, portions of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, and Samuel P. Taylor State Park.

<doc id="1260026" wikidata="Q7957407" url="?curid=1260026" title="WWOR EMI Service">
<text>WWOR EMI Service was a New York City-based American cable television channel that operated as a superstation feed of Secaucus, New Jersey-licensed WWOR-TV (channel 9). The service was uplinked to satellite from Syracuse, New York, by Eastern Microwave, Inc., which later sold the satellite distribution rights to the Advance Entertainment Corporation subsidiary of Advance Publications, a Syracuse-based company that also owned various print, broadcast and cable television properties.

In the New York metropolitan area, the superstation feed was not carried on local cable providers but was available to satellite subscribers. Two exceptions to this took place; once on February 26, 1993, after the World Trade Center bombing, when the local WWOR&#x27;s transmitter was knocked out for the day. Cable providers in the New York metro area used the superstation feed as a substitute until the transmitter returned to service. The other was on Long Beach Island in Ocean County, New Jersey. Although that area falls within the New York City market, the Comcast system serving that area carried WWOR EMI Service instead of the local feed, as they were unable to obtain a microwave link to be able to carry channel 9. Months after the end of the feed, that system began carrying the local feed, which by that point was uplinked to satellite.

==History==
In 1989, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) passed the &quot;Syndication Exclusivity Rights rule&quot; (or &quot;SyndEx&quot;) into law. This law meant that whenever a local television station had the exclusive rights to broadcast a syndicated program, that particular program must be blacked out on any out-of-market stations that were carried by local cable providers. After the law was passed, EMI purchased the rights to programs that no stations had claimed exclusive rights to, and launched a special national feed for cable and satellite subscribers outside of the New York City market on January 1, 1990, called the &quot;WWOR EMI Service&quot;. Most of the syndicated programs that WWOR-TV had the rights to show in the New York City market were covered up by the alternate programming shown on the national feed—with the exception of most sporting events, local newscasts and other WWOR-produced programming such as &quot;Steampipe Alley&quot;, &quot;The Joe Franklin Show&quot;, the overnight &quot;Shop at Home&quot; program, the annual &quot;Weekend with the Stars Telethon&quot; for United Cerebral Palsy, the annual &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot; for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and a select number of programs that were not claimed as exclusive to any market. Most of the programs came from the libraries of Universal Television (whose parent company, MCA Inc., owned WWOR-TV at the time of the EMI Service&#x27;s founding), MGM Television and Quinn Martin, along with some shows from the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;″s television service, as well as some holdover shows that had aired on the local New York feed before the SyndEx law&#x27;s passage.

In mid-1996, EMI sold the satellite distribution rights to WWOR and Boston&#x27;s WSBK-TV to Advance Entertainment Corporation. On December 31, 1996, AEC discontinued the feed, selling WWOR&#x27;s former satellite transponder slot to Discovery Communications for the then six-month-old Animal Planet, which Advance still presently owns in part.

<text>Allan Ezra Gotlieb (February 28, 1928 – April 18, 2020) was a Canadian public servant and author who served as the Canadian Ambassador to the United States from 1981 to 1989.

==Life and career==
Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Gotlieb studied at United College (now the University of Winnipeg) for two years before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his BA. He received his MA from the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar, and his LLB degree from Harvard University, where he was editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. 

In 1957, he joined the Department of External Affairs. From 1960 to 1964, he served on Canada&#x27;s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva and at the Conference on Disarmament. In 1965, he wrote the book &quot;Disarmament and International Law&quot;, a book discussing disarmament during Cold War tensions. From 1967 to 1968 he was assistant undersecretary and led the legal division at External Affairs. From 1968 to 1973, Gotlieb was deputy minister of the Department of Communications, and from 1973 to 1976 deputy minister of Manpower and Immigration. From 1977 to 1981 he was undersecretary at External Affairs.

Most notably, Gotlieb was Canadian ambassador to the United States from 1981 to 1989. His signature moment as ambassador occurred during the negotiation of the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, where he &quot;played a vital role in persuading the US to adopt a position that Canada could accept.&quot;

He and his wife Sondra Gotlieb were known for their parties attended by figures in Washington. Sondra&#x27;s book &quot;Washington Rollercoaster&quot; recounted the Gotliebs&#x27; years in Washington, when she also wrote a column for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Sondra attracted publicity on March 19, 1986, when she slapped her social secretary at an official dinner she and her husband were hosting in honour of the Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney and US Vice-President George H. W. Bush.

After Gotlieb and his wife returned to Canada in the early 1990s, they moved to Toronto. From 1989 to 1994, Gotlieb was chairman of the Canada Council. He was also publisher of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine. In 1992, Gotlieb was the Canadian representative on the arbitration panel that decided the Canada–France Maritime Boundary Case; Gotlieb dissented from the panel&#x27;s decision in the case and wrote a dissent.

Gotlieb was an honorary and former fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, and was a visiting fellow at All Souls College, Oxford.

Hollinger Inc. was among his corporate directorships. He was a member of the Carlyle Group&#x27;s Canadian advisory board and a member of the Trilateral Commission. He was also chairman of Sotheby&#x27;s Canada, former chairman of the Ontario Heritage Foundation, and served as chairman of the board of governors of the Donner Canadian Foundation, known for its annual literary prize. He was also a senior advisor in the law office of Bennett Jones.

Gotlieb was an art collector, notably of the work of 19th-century painter James Tissot. He and his wife donated their Tissot collection to the Art Gallery of Ontario. 

Gotlieb was a proponent of combining North American economic, defence, and security arrangements within a common perimeter and, in 2002, he advocated for a &quot;grand bargain&quot; with the US to create new trade rules and institutions. He argued &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t this &#x27;legal integration&#x27; be superior to &quot;ad hoc&quot; responses and largely ineffective lobbying to prevent harm from Congressional protectionist sorties?&quot; 

When Ronald Reagan died in 2004, Gotlieb provided commentary for CBC Newsworld&#x27;s coverage of the state funeral drawing from his experiences as Canadian ambassador to Washington when Reagan was president.

On the art of diplomacy in Washington, he said in 2009, &quot;You have to get the power shakers, including the media, into your dining room. When an ambassador makes a phone call to a powerful congressman, he&#x27;ll return the call once, but after that you have to make a personal relationship.&quot; Gotlieb published his diplomatic memoirs, &quot;The Washington Diaries&quot;, in 2006.

==Personal life ==
He married Sondra Gotlieb (née Kaufman) in December 1955. Gotlieb died on April 18, 2020, from cancer and Parkinson&#x27;s disease at his home in Toronto. The Gotliebs had three children, one of whom predeceased him in 2003.

==Honours==
Gottlieb was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1987 and received his insignia from Governor-General Jeanne Sauvé in Ottawa on May 6, 1988.

In 2014, he was made a member of the Order of Manitoba.

Gotlieb received the Government of Canada&#x27;s Outstanding Achievement Award in 1983, &quot;the highest recognition for executives at the deputy minister level in the Public Service.&quot;

On December 5, 2005, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Concordia University.

His book &quot;The Washington Diaries: 1981-1989&quot; was nominated for the Writer&#x27;s Trust of Canada&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Shaughnessy Cohen Award for Political Writing&quot;.

<doc id="1260042" wikidata="Q7123018" url="?curid=1260042" title="Packhorse bridge">
<text>A packhorse bridge is a bridge intended to carry packhorses (horses loaded with sidebags or panniers) across a river or stream. Typically a packhorse bridge consists of one or more narrow (one horse wide) masonry arches, and has low parapets so as not to interfere with the panniers borne by the horses. Multi-arched examples sometimes have triangular cutwaters that are extended upward to form pedestrian refuges.

Packhorse bridges were often built on the trade routes (often called packhorse routes) that formed major transport arteries across Europe and Great Britain until the coming of the turnpike roads and canals in the 18th century. Before the road-building efforts of Napoleon, all crossings of the Alps were on packhorse trails. Travellers&#x27; carriages were dismantled and transported over the mountain passes by ponies and mule trains.

==Definition==
In the British Isles at least, the definition of a packhorse bridge is somewhat nebulous. Ernest Hinchliffe discusses the difficulty of defining a true packhorse bridge in &quot;A Guide to the Packhorse Bridges of England&quot;. He claims that &quot;before the eighteenth century bridges were described as &#x27;horse bridges&#x27; or &#x27;cart bridges&#x27;&quot; and his strict definition excludes the latter. He suggests that a classic packhorse bridge should generally be:
*less than in width;
*built before 1800;
*on a recognised packhorse route.

He categorises the 190 English bridges listed in his book into three groups:
*Group 1: wide or less, built before 1800 and with known packhorse associations;
*Group 2: bridges that fail one or other of the above criteria, but which are generally referred to as packhorse bridges;
*Group 3: bridges sometimes claimed as packhorse bridges, but dismissed as such by the author.

The difficulty of classification is illustrated by Moulton Bridge in Suffolk, which Hinchliffe places in Group 1 but which English Heritage describes as &quot;perhaps not strictly a packhorse bridge since it was wide enough to take carts&quot;.

==List of packhorse bridges in the British Isles==
The following list includes all listed buildings described as packhorse bridges by English Heritage, Cadw, or Historic Scotland; all 106 of Hinchliffe&#x27;s Group 1 bridges in England; and certain other candidates. (For England, Hinchliffe&#x27;s Group numbers are given as superscripts after the bridge name.)

<text>The Apes (sometimes just Apes) were a noisy, guitarless garage rock foursome from Washington, D.C. The band formed in 1999 with the lineup of singer Paul Weil, keyboard player Amanda Kleinman (an Arts College advisor by day), bassist Erick Jackson, and drummer Jeff Schmid. They released their first EP themselves, two albums on the New York label Frenchkiss, and an EP on Planaria Records before moving to San Francisco&#x27;s Birdman Records which released an EP and the band&#x27;s third full-length album.

The band has seen its three instrumentalists remain a constant while three different men have filled the shoes of lead singer. Paul Weil left the band and was replaced by Joe Halladay, and in 2006 Halladay left the band and was replaced by the visual artist Breck Brunson, whose first recorded tracks appeared on a CD-R the band sold during its 2006 U.S. tour in support of Liars. The band&#x27;s fourth full-length album, titled &quot;Ghost Games&quot;, was released in early 2008 on Gypsy Eyes Records. In 2010, three of the band members moved to Heavy Breathing.

The band members are sometimes known by the pseudonyms Lucius Twilight (Brunson), Jackie Magik (Jackson), Majestic Ape (Kleinman), Count 101 (Weil), and Ronald Wolf (Schmid).

<text>Mathis der Maler (&quot;Matthias the Painter&quot; is an opera by Paul Hindemith. The work&#x27;s protagonist, Matthias Grünewald, was a historical figure who flourished during the Reformation, and whose art, in particular the Isenheim Altarpiece, inspired many creative figures in the early 20th century.
Hindemith completed the opera, writing his own libretto, in 1935. By that time, however, the rise of Nazism prevented Hindemith from securing a performance in Germany. The story, set during the German Peasants&#x27; War (1524–25), concerns Matthias&#x27;s struggle for artistic freedom of expression in the repressive climate of his day, which mirrored Hindemith&#x27;s own struggle as the Nazis attained power and repressed dissent. The opera&#x27;s obvious political message did not escape the regime.

==Performance history==
The opera was first performed at the Opernhaus Zürich on 28 May 1938, conducted by Robert Denzler. On 14 October 1956, a rebuilt Schauspiel Köln in Cologne opened with a gala performance of the opera. On 9 and 11 March in 1939 the opera &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot; was performed in Amsterdam, conducted by Karl Schmid-Bloss, director of the Opera in Zürich. At the same time the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam made a documentary exhibition of the painting &#x27;The Small Crucifixion&#x27; and two drawings by Mathias Grunewald owned by Franz Koenigs. The British premiere was in Edinburgh on 29 August 1952, and it was first given in the United States on 17 February 1956, at Boston University, conducted by Sarah Caldwell.

In contrast to the popular &quot;&quot;, the large-scale opera itself is only occasionally staged. A notable US production was that of the New York City Opera in 1995. Hamburg State Opera staged the work in 2005. It was being performed at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona when the building was destroyed by a fire in January 1994.

==Main roles==
==Synopsis==
===Scene 1===
In a cloister courtyard Mathis&#x27;s musings and doubts about his vocation are interrupted by the peasant leader Schwalb and his child Regina. Moved by the peasants&#x27; plight, he offers his horse and stays to face the pursuing Sylvester who dares not arrest the cardinal&#x27;s favorite painter.

===Scene 2===
A riot between Catholics, Lutherans and students in front of Albrecht&#x27;s residence in Mainz is averted only by the arrival of the Cardinal himself with relics of St. Martin:
He promises the merchant Riedinger to countermand an order to burn books, but later gives in to Pomerfeld, who points out that he cannot defy Rome. Mathis, reunited with Reidinger&#x27;s daughter Ursula, is recognized by Sylvester and makes a passionate plea to Albrecht not to join in the suppression of the peasant&#x27;s revolt. Realizing he cannot change his friend&#x27;s mind, Albrecht grants him safe passage to join their cause.

===Scene 3===
The Lutherans are at first outraged when Capito leads soldiers to the stash of hidden books in Reidinger&#x27;s house (&quot;Ein Verbrechen / Gegen Luther, gegen deutsche Glaubenskraft&quot; [A crime / Against Luther, against the power of German faith]), but appeased when he reveals a letter from Luther to Albrecht suggesting that he demonstrate his advanced views by marrying:

Albrecht, &quot;the strongest clerical prince in Germany&quot; who &quot;... holds / The fate of the Empire in his hands&quot; is in such dire financial straits that it is likely he would agree, and Reidinger asks Ursula to give thought to the matter as it would be to the benefit of both the Lutheran faith and the Empire. Mathis arrives to bid farewell and insists she cannot follow him to the war. When her father returns she gives her consent to the plan.

At the end of scene 3, all men chant a paean to God, their religion and the fatherland:
===Scene 4===
The peasant army has captured the Helfensteins, marching the Count to execution and humiliating the Countess. Asked for their demands, one of the peasants replies, amongst others, that they do not accept any ruler save the emperor (&quot;Kein Herrscher gilt / Als der Kaiser&quot;). Mathis remonstrates and is beaten down. The federal army arrives and the disheartened peasants prepare for battle but are quickly overrun; Schwalb is killed and Mathis barely saved by the Countess. He flees with the orphaned Regina.

===Scene 5===
Albrecht discusses his debts and Luther&#x27;s challenge with Capito and agrees to interview a rich bride. He is astonished when Ursula enters and, dubious of her avowals, reproaches her for lending herself to the scheme. She admits that she is motivated not by love but by her faith to attempt his conversion, and in turn reproaches him for his vacillations and his lack of vision. He appears to be profoundly moved by her plea, but when the others are called in he announces that he will reform his ways by striving to return to his vows and to lead a simple life.

===Scene 6===

In the Odenwald forest Mathis lulls the haunted Regina to sleep with a description of a concert of angels, she joining in the folksong &quot;&quot; (this is the music of the &#x27;s first movement). No sooner is she asleep but Mathis, now in the garb of Grünewald&#x27;s Saint Anthony, is beset by tempters: a figure resembling the Countess Helfenstein offers a life of luxury; Pommersfelden praises power over money; Ursula appears in the guises of a beggar, then a seductress and, led to the scaffold, as a martyr; Capito, now a scholar, tells &#x27;Anthony&#x27; the world can be mastered by science and reproaches him for unobjectivity; Schwalb upbraids for his unwarlike compassion. The chorus unite in an enactment of the temptation scene of the Isenheim Altarpiece before the scene suddenly changes to that of Anthony&#x27;s visit to St. Paul the Simple. Paul/Albrecht consoles Anthony/Mathis and calls him to his duty: &quot;go forth and paint&quot;.

===Scene 7===
Ursula cares for the dying Regina, who confuses Mathis&#x27; painting of the dying Christ with her father. Only the sight of Mathis calms her before she dies. In the morning (following the interlude from the Symphony) he is visited by Albrecht who offers his home, but Mathis prefers to spend his last days in solitude. Packing his trunk, he bids farewell to good intentions – a scroll, ambition – compass and ruler, creation – paints and brush, acclaim – a gold chain, questioning – books, and last, kissing a ribbon from Ursula – to love.

<text>Maurice André Raymond Herzog (; 15 January 191913 December 2012) was a French mountaineer and administrator who was born in Lyon, France. He led the 1950 French Annapurna expedition that first climbed a peak over 8000m, Annapurna, in 1950, and reached the summit with Louis Lachenal. Upon his return, he wrote a best-selling book about the expedition, &quot;Annapurna&quot;.

== Ascent of Annapurna I: a historic exploit ==

On 3 June 1950, Herzog and Louis Lachenal became the first climbers in modern history to climb a peak over 8000m when, on the 1950 French Annapurna expedition, they summited the Himalayan mountain Annapurna I, the 10th-highest mountain in the world. The ascent was all the more remarkable because the peak was explored, reconnoitered and climbed all within one season; and was climbed without the use of supplemental oxygen. It is also the only 8000 meter summit that was reached at the first attempt. Herzog was awarded the 1950 Gold Medal of the Société de Géographie.

The event caused a huge sensation that was only matched when Everest was summited in 1953 by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay.

The two-week retreat from the peak proved very challenging. Both climbers had opted for light boots for the summit dash. This, combined with Herzog losing his gloves near the summit and a night spent bivouacked in a crevasse on the descent with one sleeping bag for four climbers (Lachenal, Gaston Rébuffat, Lionel Terray, and Herzog) resulted in severe frostbite, with consequent gangrene requiring the expedition doctor to perform emergency amputations in the field. Both summit climbers lost all of their toes and Herzog most of his fingers.

Annapurna I was not climbed again until 1970, when the French north face route was climbed by a British Army expedition led by Colonel Henry Day, simultaneously with an ascent of the south face by an expedition led by British climber Chris Bonington. The mountain&#x27;s fourth ascent was not until 1977.

==Book==
Herzog&#x27;s account of the expedition was published first in 1951 in French, then in English in 1952 under the title &quot;Annapurna&quot;. The book has sold over 11 million copies as of 2000, more than any other mountaineering title. Ending with the stirring line &quot;there are other Annapurnas in the lives of men&quot; (in the context of the book, an exhortation to answer the challenges that life offers), the book gave an account of the expedition that established Herzog&#x27;s climbing reputation and inspired a generation of mountaineers.

== Controversy over his account of the ascent ==
Some aspects of Herzog&#x27;s account of the summit day have been called into question with the publication of other members’ accounts of the expedition, most significantly by a biography of Gaston Rébuffat and the posthumous publication, in 1996, of Lachenal&#x27;s contemporaneous journals. The 2000 book &quot;True Summit: What Really Happened on the Legendary Ascent of Annapurna&quot; by David Roberts gives one view of the controversy.

== Other achievements ==
Herzog went on to become the French Minister of Youth and Sport from 1958 to 1963, and mayor of the alpine town of Chamonix-Mont-Blanc. He was a member of the International Olympic Committee for 25 years from 1970, and has an honorary member after 1995. He was a Grand Officer of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur and holder of the Croix de Guerre for military service 1939–45.

Herzog was a 1944 graduate of the French business school HEC Paris.

<text>Ectogenesis (from the Greek &quot;ἐκτός&quot;, &quot;outside&quot;, and &quot;&quot;) is the growth of an organism in an artificial environment, outside the body in which it would normally be found, such as the growth of an embryo or fetus outside the mother&#x27;s body, or the growth of bacteria outside the body of a host. The term was coined by British scientist J. B. S. Haldane in 1924.

== Human embryos and fetuses ==

Ectogenesis of human embryos and fetuses would require an artificial uterus. An artificial uterus would have to be supplied with nutrients and oxygen from some source to nurture the fetus, as well as dispose of waste material. There would likely be a need for an interface between such a supplier, filling this function of the placenta. As a replacement organ, an artificial uterus could be used to assist women with damaged, diseased or removed uteri to allow the fetus to be conceived to term. It also has the potential to move the threshold of fetal viability to a much earlier stage of pregnancy. This would have implications for the ongoing controversy regarding human reproductive rights. Ectogenesis could also be a means by which homosexual, impotent, disabled, and single men and women could have genetic offspring without the use of surrogate pregnancy or a sperm donor, and allow women to have children without going through the pregnancy cycle.

== Synthetic embryo ==

In 2022, Jacob Hanna and his team at the Weizmann Institute of Science created early &quot;embryo-like structures&#x27;&quot; from mice stem cells. Their research was published by &quot;Cell&quot; on 1 August 2022. The world&#x27;s first synthetic embryo does not require sperm, eggs, nor fertilization, and were grown from only embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or also from stem cells other than ESCs. The structure had an intestinal tract, early brain, and a beating heart and a placenta with a yolk sac around the embryo. The researchers said it could lead to better understanding of organ and tissue development, new sources of cells and tissues for human transplantation, although human synthetic embryos are a long ways off.

Also in August 2022, a study described how University of Cambridge, alongside the same Weizmann Institute of Science scientists, created a synthetic embryo with a brain and a beating heart by using stem cells (also some stem cells other than ESCs). No human eggs nor sperm were used. They showed natural-like development and some survived until day 8.5 where early organogenesis, including formation of foundations of a brain, occurs. Scientists hope it can be used to create synthetic human organs for transplantation.

The embryos grew &quot;in vitro&quot; and subsequently &quot;ex utero&quot; in an artificial womb published the year before by the Hanna team in &quot;Nature&quot;, and was used in both studies. Potential applications include &quot;uncovering the role of different genes in birth defects or developmental disorders&quot;, gaining &quot;direct insight into the origins of a new life&quot;, &quot;understand[ing] why some pregnancies fail&quot;, and developing sources &quot;of organs and tissues for people who need them&quot;. The term &quot;synthetic embryo&quot; in the title of the second study was later changed to the alternative term &quot;embryo model&quot;.

On 6 September 2023, &quot;Nature&quot; published research that the Weizmann Institute team created the first complete human day 14 post-implantation embryo models, using naïve ES cells expanded in special naive conditions developed by the same team in 2021. It also uses reprogrammed genetically unmodified naïve stem cells to become any type of body tissue. The embryo model (termed and abbreviated as SEM) mimics all the key structures like a &quot;textbook image&quot; of a human day-14 embryo.

== Bioethical considerations ==
The development of artificial uteri and ectogenesis raises a few bioethical and legal considerations, and also has important implications for reproductive rights and the abortion debate.

Artificial uteri may expand the range of fetal viability, raising questions about the role that fetal viability plays within abortion law. For example, within severance theory, abortion rights only include the right to remove the fetus, and do not always extend to the termination of the fetus. In the abortion debate, the death of the fetus has historically been considered an unavoidable side effect rather than the primary goal of an abortion. If transferring the fetus from a woman&#x27;s womb to an artificial uterus becomes possible, then the choice to terminate a pregnancy in this way could result in a living child. Thus, the pregnancy could be aborted at any point, which respects the woman&#x27;s right to bodily autonomy, without impinging on the moral status of the embryo or fetus.

There are theoretical concerns that children who develop in an artificial uterus may lack &quot;some essential bond with their mothers that other children have&quot;, a secondary issue to woman&#x27;s rights over their own body. In the 1970 book &quot;The Dialectic of Sex&quot;, feminist Shulamith Firestone wrote that differences in biological reproductive roles are a source of gender inequality. Firestone singled out pregnancy and childbirth, making the argument that an artificial womb would free &quot;women from the tyranny of their reproductive biology.&quot;

<text>TheSoap Opera DigestAwards, originally known as The Soapy Awards when introduced in 1977, was an awards show held by the daytime television magazine &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;.

==History==

=== 1977–1983 ===
The Soapy Awards were an award presented by &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; magazine to the best work on American soap operas from 1977 until 1983. Unlike their successors, the &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards, this accolade lacked a great deal of glamour. The statue itself was a tall geometric crystal and were presented during a television show after winners were announced in the magazine. The original award was designed by the magazine&#x27;s art director Janis Rogak.

The magazine&#x27;s editor Ruth J. Gordon, who was founding editor made the very first presentation on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;.

The first awards were presented during the &quot;Merv Griffin Show&quot; to Best Actor Bill Hayes and Best Actress Susan Seaforth Hayes from &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (which also won for &#x27;Favorite Show&#x27;). This first award also included a special award for &#x27;Outstanding Achievement in the World of Daytime Drama&#x27; to &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;″s creator Agnes Nixon.

The 1978 award were presented live during &quot;America Live&quot; from both New York and Hollywood. The 1979 show was presented on the Thursday Dec. 27, 1979 episode of &quot;Dinah and Friends&quot;.

In 1980, during the height of &quot;Luke and Laura&quot;, their portrayers Anthony Geary and Genie Francis won for Best Actor and Best Actress. An award for &#x27;Favorite Performer in a Mature Role&#x27; went to &quot;All My Children&quot;″s Ruth Warrick.

The 1981 show incorporated many of the categories which would become a hallmark of the &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards, such as &#x27;Most Exciting New Actor&#x27; (Tristan Rogers, &quot;General Hospital&quot;), &#x27;Favorite Villain&#x27; (Andre Landzaat, &quot;General Hospital&quot;), and &#x27;Favorite Villainess&#x27; (Robin Mattson, &quot;General Hospital&quot;). That year, the awards were swept by &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

In 1984, the awards were replaced by the &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards.

=== 1984–2005 ===
In 1984, the awards evolved into &quot;The&quot; &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards, to replace the less-lavish &quot;Soapy Award&quot;. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards were meant to promote excellence in the soap opera genre and were decided by the fans who read the magazine. The statue itself was made of crystal and in the shape of a heart.

The first &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Award show aired in 1984, and was featured on national syndicated television and hosted by then husband and wife Catherine Hickland and David Hasselhoff. One of the reasons for the move up was the new-found audience of both Daytime and Prime time soap operas. That year for the first time awards were given to prime time soap operas as well as daytime soaps. This practice was phased out in the 1990s as primetime soap operas began to lose the large appeal they once had.

For the first two years, fans themselves voted on the nominees list as well as the winners. Ballot stuffing and a voting bloc for the 1985 awards led to the side effect where &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; swept almost every category. The third awards were changed so that the editors of the magazine chose the nominees and each reader was allowed only one ballot to vote for their favorites. This allowed other shows such as &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; and &quot;Another World&quot; to take home trophies. A change in award season from the end of the year to the beginning meant that there was no show in 1987.

In 1992 the awards were broadcast live for the first time; in addition, the award statue (previously a flat crystal heart) was redesigned to be an inch taller. NBC had aired the event ever since it made its way to network television, but the show would no longer be seen on the network after the airing of the 2000 awards. The year 2001 marked the first time that there was no awards ceremony and voting was done entirely online. In 2003 the cable channel SOAPnet broadcast the awards which were hosted by Lisa Rinna and Ty Treadway.

In 2001, the award was featured in the episode &quot;The One with Joey&#x27;s Award&quot; for the show &quot;Friends&quot;, in which Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) was nominated for a Soapy for his fictional role in &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; but does not win. In the episode, Joey says the awards began in 1998, so it&#x27;s likely not meant to be the same award, but rather a homage.

No awards were given out in 2002 or 2004. The 2005 awards were done entirely through the magazine. Fans could find a ballot in a November issue of &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; and then mail it to the editors. Only one ballot per person was counted. The awards were announced in the magazine in February 2005.

<text>Maurice John Cowling (6 September 1926 – 24 August 2005) was a British historian. A fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, for most of his career, Cowling was a leading conservative exponent of the &#x27;high politics&#x27; approach to political history.

==Early life==
Cowling was born in West Norwood, South London, son of Reginald Frederick Cowling (1901–1962), a patent agent, and his wife May (née Roberts). His family then moved to Streatham, where Cowling attended an LCC elementary school and, from 1937, Battersea Grammar School. When the Second World War started in 1939 the school moved to Worthing and then from 1940 to Hertford, where Cowling attended sixth form.

In 1943 Cowling won a scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge, but was called up for military service in September 1944, where he joined the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment. In 1945, after training and serving in a holding battalion, he was sent to Bangalore as an officer cadet.

In 1946 Cowling was attached to the Kumaon Regiment and the next year-and-a-half he travelled to Agra, Razmak on the North-West Frontier and Assam. As independence for India neared in 1947, Cowling was dispatched to Egypt as a camp adjutant to the British HQ there. Cowling was then promoted to captain in Libya. By the end of 1947 he was finally demobilised, and in 1948 he went back to Jesus College to complete his History Tripos, where he received a double first. Cowling later remembered that he fell in love with Cambridge. He toyed with the idea of being ordained and went to college chapel, possessing &quot;a strong polemical Christianity&quot;. Of his religion, Cowling later said: 

In 1954 Cowling worked at the British Foreign Office for six months at the Jordan department, and in early 1955, &quot;The Times&quot; gave him the job of foreign leader-writer, which he held for three years. In 1957 Cowling was invited by the Director of the Conservative Political Centre to write a pamphlet on the Suez Crisis; it was never published however, as the party wanted to move on from Suez as quickly as possible. He stood unsuccessfully for the parliamentary seat of Bassetlaw during the General Election of 1959 for the Conservative Party. Cowling later said that &quot;I enjoyed being a candidate, though it was very hard work and elections are like what I imagine having all your teeth out is like&quot;.

== Academic career ==
In 1961 Cowling was elected a fellow of Jesus College and Director of Studies in Economics, shortly before the History Faculty appointed him to an Assistant Lectureship. Cowling&#x27;s first book was &quot;The Nature and Limits of Political Science&quot;. Influenced by Michael Oakeshott, this was an attack on political science and political philosophy as it was then taught. Cowling argued that social science&#x27;s claim to have discovered how people behaved was false because politics was too complex and fluid to be rationalised by theorists and only fully intelligible to politicians.

During six weeks of the summer of 1962 Cowling wrote &quot;Mill and Liberalism&quot;, which was published in 1963 and became one of his most contentious books. The book argued Mill was not as libertarian as he was traditionally portrayed, and that Mill resembled a &quot;moral totalitarian&quot;. Dr. Roland Hall reviewed the book in &quot;Philosophical Quarterly&quot; (January 1965) and called it &quot;dangerous and unpleasant&quot;, with Cowling later remarking that this &quot;was what it was intended to be&quot;.

In 1963 he was elected a Fellow to Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he advised his students to tackle liberals with &quot;irony, geniality and malice&quot;. During the 1960s Cowling campaigned against a sociology course to be introduced at Cambridge, regarding it as a &quot;vehicle for liberal dogma&quot;. In November 1966 Cowling was elected as a Conservative councillor on the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely County Council in a by-election, which he held until 1970.

He was appointed the literary editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot; from 1970 to 1971, and in the early 1970s he wrote articles of a broadly Powellite nature arguing against the UK being a member of the EEC. Cowling resigned in 1971 when the editor acting in George Gale&#x27;s absence refused to publish Cowling&#x27;s protest against his publication of an article by Tony Palmer which suggested that the important question about Princess Anne was whether she was a virgin.

It was on Cowling&#x27;s suggestion that Paul Smith edited a collection of Lord Salisbury&#x27;s articles from the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, published in 1972.

In 1977 Margaret Thatcher visited the Cambridge Graduate Conservative Association of Peterhouse where she &quot;cut through the compact subtlety and &#x27;rational pessimism&#x27; of [Cowling]&quot; and sharply retorted: &quot;We don&#x27;t want pessimists in our party&quot;. In 1978 he ceased to be Director of Studies in Peterhouse, and helped to found the Salisbury Group, a group of conservative thinkers named, on Michael Oakeshott&#x27;s advice, after Lord Salisbury. In the same year Cowling published &quot;Conservative Essays&quot; where he said:

Cowling was &quot;instrumental&quot; in getting the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, Lord Dacre of Glanton, from Oxford to become Master of Peterhouse from 1980 to 1987, though in later years he came to regret supporting Trevor-Roper&#x27;s arrival there. Cowling&#x27;s reactionary clique thought he would be an arch-conservative who would oppose the admission of women. In the event, Trevor-Roper feuded constantly with Cowling and his allies, while launching a series of administrative reforms. Women were admitted in 1983 at Trevor-Roper&#x27;s urging. The British journalist Neal Ascherson summarised the quarrel between Cowling and Trevor-Roper as:Lord Dacre, far from being a romantic Tory ultra, turned out to be an anti-clerical Whig with a preference for free speech over superstition. He did not find it normal that fellows should wear mourning on the anniversary of General Franco’s death, attend parties in SS uniform or insult black and Jewish guests at high table. For the next seven years, Trevor-Roper battled to suppress the insurgency of the Cowling clique (&quot;a strong mind trapped in its own glutinous frustrations&quot;), and to bring the college back to a condition in which students might actually want to go there. Neither side won this struggle, which soon became a campaign to drive Trevor-Roper out of the college by grotesque rudeness and insubordination. In a review of Adam Sisman&#x27;s 2010 biography of Trevor-Roper, the &quot;Economist&quot; wrote that the picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was &quot;startling&quot;, stating the college had become under Cowling&#x27;s influence a sort of right-wing &quot;lunatic asylum&quot;, who were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper&#x27;s reforms.

In November 1989 Cowling published his essay on &quot;The Sources of the New Right&quot; in &quot;Encounter&quot; which detailed the ideological roots of Thatcherism in Britain and became the Preface to the second edition of &quot;Mill and Liberalism&quot; in 1990. In 1990 Cowling described himself as &quot;an intellectual Thatcherite, just as I was an intellectual Powellite, and I think it is important that the Conservative party should be in good hands and that it should win elections...I am a warm supporter [of the Thatcher government]&quot;. In Cowling&#x27;s view &quot;Liberalism is essentially the belief that there can be a reconciliation of all difficulties and differences, and since there can&#x27;t, it is a misleading way to approach politics&quot;. He regarded Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; as &quot;a nasty, sneering, free-thinking book ... I can understand why the book is offensive and it didn&#x27;t seem to me to be anything but offensive when I read it. Some thinking Moslems take a view of the nature of religion, and the incompatibility between Islam and liberalism, which runs parallel to what I&#x27;m saying in &quot;Mill and Liberalism&quot;&quot;.

In 1992 Philip Williamson published his book on British politics from 1926 to 1932 and said Cowling &quot;provided the original inspiration&quot; for it.

== Later life ==
Cowling retired from the History Faculty of Cambridge in 1988, and from his Fellowship of Peterhouse in 1993. He rarely returned to the university. In 1996, in Swansea, where he now lived, Cowling married George Gale&#x27;s ex-wife Patricia, with whom he had long conducted an affair. On 24 August 2005, Cowling died at Singleton Hospital in Swansea after a long illness.

==&quot;The Politics of British Democracy&quot;==
Cowling wrote three books on British high politics, the sequence he called &quot;The Politics of British Democracy&quot;. He wrote that &quot;In the future there will be an introduction bearing the sequence-title which will deal in its widest aspects with the period from 1850 to 1940 and will assess the methods used in the volumes which have now been published&quot;. However this never appeared. Cowling wrote a letter to &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; on 3 June 1977 arguing for the need for &quot;a different emphasis&quot; to that on high politics.

The first of these was &quot;1867: Disraeli, Gladstone and Revolution: the Passing of the Second Reform Bill&quot;, about the Reform Act 1867. This was published during its centenary and dedicated to &quot;the Prime Minister&quot;, Labour leader Harold Wilson. Cowling challenged the traditional liberal assumptions over the reform crisis of the 1860s by arguing that the Liberal Party was not the straightforward progressive party that wanted to hand political power to the working-class and that the Conservatives did not promote reform in reaction to working-class pressure. Cowling instead placed much more importance on parliamentary manoeuvres. Robert Blake thought that this book &quot;gives the most convincing account of what happened&quot;.

In 1971 appeared &quot;The Impact of Labour&quot;, which dealt with the years between 1920, after Labour won the Spen Valley by-election, and 1924 when the Conservatives won the general election of that year and ended the Liberal Party as a realistic party of government, with the Labour Party emerging as the Opposition.

Cowling believed the decisions and actions of “the politicians who mattered” (who, by his count, numbered a mere fifty or sixty) could not “be understood as derivative offshoots of pre-existing social conditions.” The historian’s job was therefore to “impute motive, intention and disingenuousness to the [political] actors whose personalities we have created out of the letters and speeches which survive.” 

In 1975 appeared &quot;The Impact of Hitler&quot;, dealing with 1933 to 1940. Cowling has been described as an &quot;isolationist imperialist&quot; who argued that from Britain&#x27;s point of view the Second World War was a &quot;liberal war which had been entered into in a condition of moral indignation without the resources to fight it&quot; and that it had been &quot;providential good fortune which had placed the burden of fighting on the Russians and the Americans&quot;. He disapproved of the fact that the war was followed by a Labour electoral landslide, a greatly expanded welfare state and the liquidation of the British Empire. 

The policy making process for Cowling is heavily influenced by party politics. Cowling was well known for his &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; (&quot;primacy of domestic politics&quot;) explanations for British foreign policy; for example, he argued that the British &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland issued on 31 March 1939 was advanced to improve the Conservatives&#x27; chances against Labour, and had nothing to do with foreign policy considerations. Cowling&#x27;s approach is the opposite of the &quot;Primat der Außenpolitik&quot; (&quot;primacy of foreign politics&quot;) thesis.

==&quot;Religion and Public Doctrine in Modern England&quot;==

In 1980, 1985 and 2001 appeared the three volumes of Cowling&#x27;s &quot;Religion and Public Doctrine in Modern England&quot;. The political history books required &quot;tiring archival visits&quot;; Cowling much preferred writing these. In researching for these books &quot;He spent his days in his college rooms, muscularly grappling with books, indeed often physically ripping them apart. Made up of hundreds of essays on the thought of individuals, the work neither engaged with other scholarship nor developed an interpretative model for understanding modern Britain&quot;. Cowling placed Christianity squarely at the centre of English culture post-1840 and claimed that anti-Christians more often than not held traditional religious assumptions and prejudices. Secularisation was not so fast or complete as had been previously argued, but &quot;defenders of orthodoxy as well as their assailants were subjected to pithy, provocative irony&quot; by Cowling.

<doc id="1260095" wikidata="Q1139756" url="?curid=1260095" title="BIOS interrupt call">
<text>BIOS implementations provide interrupts that can be invoked by operating systems and application programs to use the facilities of the firmware on IBM PC compatible computers. Traditionally, BIOS calls are mainly used by DOS programs and some other software such as boot loaders (including, mostly historically, relatively simple application software that boots directly and runs without an operating system—especially game software). BIOS runs in the real address mode (Real Mode) of the x86 CPU, so programs that call BIOS either must also run in real mode or must switch from protected mode to real mode before calling BIOS and then switching back again. For this reason, modern operating systems that use the CPU in Protected mode or Long mode generally do not use the BIOS interrupt calls to support system functions, although they use the BIOS interrupt calls to probe and initialize hardware during booting. Real mode has the 1MB memory limitation, modern boot loaders (e.g. GRUB2, Windows Boot Manager) use the unreal mode or protected mode (and execute the BIOS interrupt calls in the Virtual 8086 mode, but only for OS booting) to access up to 4GB memory.

In all computers, software instructions control the physical hardware (screen, disk, keyboard, etc.) from the moment the power is switched on. In a PC, the BIOS, pre-loaded in ROM on the motherboard, takes control immediately after the CPU is reset, including during power-up, when a hardware reset button is pressed, or when a critical software failure (a triple fault) causes the mainboard circuitry to automatically trigger a hardware reset. The BIOS tests the hardware and initializes its state; finds, loads, and runs the boot program (usually, an OS boot loader, and historical ROM BASIC); and provides basic hardware control to the software running on the machine, which is usually an operating system (with application programs) but may be a directly booting single software application.

For IBM&#x27;s part, they provided all the information needed to use their BIOS fully or to directly utilize the hardware and avoid BIOS completely, when programming the early IBM PC models (prior to the PS/2). From the beginning, programmers had the choice of using BIOS or not, on a per-hardware-peripheral basis. IBM did strongly encourage the authorship of &quot;well-behaved&quot; programs that accessed hardware only through BIOS INT calls (and DOS service calls), to support compatibility of software with current and future PC models having dissimilar peripheral hardware, but IBM understood that for some software developers and hardware customers, a capability for user software to directly control the hardware was a requirement. In part, this was because a significant subset of all the hardware features and functions was not exposed by the BIOS services. For two examples (among many), the MDA and CGA adapters are capable of hardware scrolling, and the PC serial adapter is capable of interrupt-driven data transfer, but the IBM BIOS supports neither of these useful technical features.

Today, the BIOS in a new PC still supports most, if not all, of the BIOS interrupt function calls defined by IBM for the IBM AT (introduced in 1984), along with many more newer ones, plus extensions to some of the originals (e.g. expanded parameter ranges) promulgated by various other organizations and collaborative industry groups. This, combined with a similar degree of hardware compatibility, means that most programs written for an IBM AT can still run correctly on a new PC today, assuming that the faster speed of execution is acceptable (which it typically is for all but games that use CPU-based timing). Despite the considerable limitations of the services accessed through the BIOS interrupts, they have proven extremely useful and durable to technological change.

== Purpose of BIOS calls ==
BIOS interrupt calls perform hardware control or I/O functions requested by a program, return system information to the program, or do both. A key element of the purpose of BIOS calls is abstraction - the BIOS calls perform generally defined functions, and the specific details of how those functions are executed on the particular hardware of the system are encapsulated in the BIOS and hidden from the program. So, for example, a program that wants to read from a hard disk does not need to know whether the hard disk is an ATA, SCSI, or SATA drive (or in earlier days, an ESDI drive, or an MFM or RLL drive with perhaps a Seagate ST-506 controller, perhaps one of the several Western Digital controller types, or with a different proprietary controller of another brand). The program only needs to identify the BIOS-defined number of the drive it wishes to access and the address of the sector it needs to read or write, and the BIOS will take care of translating this general request into the specific sequence of elementary operations required to complete the task through the particular disk controller hardware that is connected to that drive. The program is freed from needing to know how to control at a low level every type of hard disk (or display adapter, or port interface, or real-time clock peripheral) that it may need to access. This both makes programming operating systems and applications easier and makes the programs smaller, reducing the duplication of program code, as the functionality that is included in the BIOS does not need to be included in every program that needs it; relatively short calls to the BIOS are included in the programs instead. (In operating systems where the BIOS is not used, service calls provided by the operating system itself generally fulfill the same function and purpose.)

The BIOS also frees computer hardware designers (to the extent that programs are written to use the BIOS exclusively) from being constrained to maintain exact hardware compatibility with old systems when designing new systems, in order to maintain compatibility with existing software. For example, the keyboard hardware on the IBM PCjr works very differently than the keyboard hardware on earlier IBM PC models, but to programs that use the keyboard only through the BIOS, this difference is nearly invisible. (As a good example of the other side of this issue, a significant share of the PC programs in use at the time the PCjr was introduced did not use the keyboard through BIOS exclusively, so IBM also included hardware features in the PCjr to emulate the way the original IBM PC and IBM PC XT keyboard hardware works. The hardware emulation is not exact, so not all programs that try to use the keyboard hardware directly will work correctly on the PCjr, but all programs that use only the BIOS keyboard services will.)

In addition to giving access to hardware facilities, BIOS provides added facilities that are implemented in the BIOS software. For example, the BIOS maintains separate cursor positions for up to eight text display pages and provides for TTY-like output with automatic line wrap and interpretation of basic control characters such as carriage return and line feed, whereas the CGA-compatible text display hardware has only one global display cursor and cannot automatically advance the cursor, use the cursor position to address the display memory (so as to determine which character cell will be changed or examined), or interpret control characters. For another example, the BIOS keyboard interface interprets many keystrokes and key combinations to keep track of the various shift states (left and right &quot;Shift&quot;, &quot;Ctrl&quot;, and &quot;Alt&quot;), to call the print-screen service when &quot;Shift&quot;+&quot;PrtScrn&quot; is pressed, to reboot the system when &quot;Ctrl&quot;+&quot;Alt&quot;+&quot;Del&quot; is pressed, to keep track of the lock states (Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock) and, in AT-class machines, control the corresponding lock-state indicator lights on the keyboard, and to perform other similar interpretive and management functions for the keyboard. In contrast, the ordinary capabilities of the standard PC and PC-AT keyboard hardware are limited to reporting to the system each primitive event of an individual key being pressed or released (i.e. making a transition from the &quot;released&quot; state to the &quot;depressed&quot; state or vice versa), performing a commanded reset and self-test of the keyboard unit, and, for AT-class keyboards, executing a command from the host system to set the absolute states of the lock-state indicators (LEDs).

== Calling BIOS: BIOS software interrupts ==
Operating systems and other software communicate with the BIOS software, in order to control the installed hardware, via software interrupts. A software interrupt is a specific variety of the general concept of an interrupt. An interrupt is a mechanism by which the CPU can be
directed to stop executing the main-line program and immediately execute a special program, called an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), instead. Once the ISR finishes, the CPU continues with the main program. On x86 CPUs, when an interrupt occurs, the ISR to call is found by looking it up in a table of ISR starting-point addresses (called &quot;interrupt vectors&quot;) in memory: the Interrupt vector table (IVT). An interrupt is invoked by its type number, from 0 to 255, and the type number is used as an index into the Interrupt Vector Table, and at that index in the table is found the address of the ISR that will be run in response to the interrupt. A software interrupt is simply an interrupt that is triggered by a software command; therefore, software interrupts function like subroutines, with the main difference that the program that makes a software interrupt call does not need to know the address of the ISR, only its interrupt number. This has advantages for modularity, compatibility, and flexibility in system configuration.

BIOS interrupt calls can be thought of as a mechanism for passing messages between BIOS and BIOS client software such as an operating system. The messages request data or action from BIOS and return the requested data, status information, and/or the product of the requested action to the caller. The messages are broken into categories, each with its own interrupt number, and most categories contain sub-categories, called &quot;functions&quot; and identified by &quot;function numbers&quot;. A BIOS client passes most information to BIOS in CPU registers, and receives most information back the same way, but data too large to fit in registers, such as tables of control parameters or disk sector data for disk transfers, is passed by allocating a buffer (i.e. some space) in memory and passing the address of the buffer in registers. (Sometimes multiple addresses of data items in memory may be passed in a data structure in memory, with the address of that structure passed to BIOS in registers.) The interrupt number is specified as the parameter of the software interrupt instruction (in Intel assembly language, an &quot;INT&quot; instruction), and the function number is specified in the AH register; that is, the caller sets the AH register to the number of the desired function. In general, the BIOS services corresponding to each interrupt number operate independently of each other, but the functions within one interrupt service are handled by the same BIOS program and are not independent. (This last point is relevant to reentrancy.)

The BIOS software usually returns to the caller with an error code if not successful, or with a status code and/or requested data if successful. The data itself can be as small as one bit or as large as 65,536 bytes of whole raw disk sectors (the maximum that will fit into one real-mode memory segment). BIOS has been expanded and enhanced over the years many times by many different corporate entities, and unfortunately the result of this evolution is that not all the BIOS functions that can be called use consistent conventions for formatting and communicating data or for reporting results. Some BIOS functions report detailed status information, while others may not even report success or failure but just return silently, leaving the caller to assume success (or to test the outcome some other way). Sometimes it can also be difficult to determine whether or not a certain BIOS function call is supported by the BIOS on a certain computer, or what the limits of a call&#x27;s parameters are on that computer. (For some invalid function numbers, or valid function numbers with invalid values of key parameters—particularly with an early IBM BIOS version—the BIOS may do nothing and return with no error code; then it is the [inconvenient but inevitable] responsibility of the caller either to avoid this case by not making such calls, or to positively test for an expected effect of the call rather than assuming that the call was effective. Because BIOS has evolved extensively in many steps over its history, a function that is valid in one BIOS version from some certain vendor may not be valid in an earlier or divergent BIOS version from the same vendor or in a BIOS version—of any relative age—from a different vendor.)

Because BIOS interrupt calls use CPU register-based parameter passing, the calls are oriented to being made from assembly language and cannot be directly made from most high-level languages (HLLs). However, a high level language may provide a library of wrapper routines which translate parameters from the form (usually stack-based) used by the high-level language to the register-based form required by BIOS, then back to the HLL calling convention after the BIOS returns. In some variants of C, BIOS calls can be made using inline assembly language within a C module. (Support for inline assembly language is not part of the ANSI C standard but is a language extension; therefore, C modules that use inline assembly language are less portable than pure ANSI standard C modules.)

=== Invoking an interrupt ===

Invoking an interrupt can be done using the INT x86 assembly language instruction. For example, to print a character to the screen using BIOS interrupt 0x10, the following x86 assembly language instructions could be executed:
 mov ah, 0x0e ; function number = 0Eh : Display Character
 mov al, &#x27;!&#x27; ; AL = code of character to display
 int 0x10 ; call INT 10h, BIOS video service
==Interrupt table==

A list of common BIOS interrupt classes can be found below. Some BIOSes (particularly old ones) do not implement all of these interrupt classes.

The BIOS also uses some interrupts to relay hardware event interrupts to programs which choose to receive them or to route messages for its own use.

==: execute BASIC==
 traditionally jumped to an implementation of Cassette BASIC (provided by Microsoft) stored in Option ROMs. This call would typically be invoked if the BIOS was unable to identify any bootable disk volumes on startup.

At the time the original IBM PC (IBM machine type 5150) was released in 1981, the BASIC in ROM was a key feature. Contemporary popular personal computers such as the Commodore 64 and the Apple II line also had Microsoft Cassette BASIC in ROM (though Commodore renamed their licensed version Commodore BASIC), so in a substantial portion of its intended market, the IBM PC needed BASIC to compete. As on those other systems, the IBM PC&#x27;s ROM BASIC served as a primitive diskless operating system, allowing the user to load, save, and run programs, as well as to write and refine them. (The original IBM PC was also the only PC model from IBM that, like its aforementioned two competitors, included cassette interface hardware. A base model IBM PC had only 16 KiB of RAM and no disk drives of any kind, so the cassette interface and BASIC in ROM were essential to make the base model usable. An IBM PC with less than 32 KiB of RAM is incapable of booting from disk. Of the five 8 KiB ROM chips in an original IBM PC, totaling 40 KiB, four contain BASIC and only one contains the BIOS; when only 16 KiB of RAM are installed, the ROM BASIC accounts for 4/7ths of the total system memory.)

As time went on and BASIC was no longer shipped on all PCs, this interrupt would simply display an error message indicating that no bootable volume was found (such as &quot;No ROM BASIC&quot;, or more explanatory messages in later BIOS versions); in other BIOS versions it would prompt the user to insert a bootable volume and press a key, and then after the user pressed a key it would loop back to the bootstrap loader (INT 19h) to try booting again.

Digital&#x27;s Rainbow 100B used to call its BIOS, which was incompatible with the IBM BIOS. Turbo Pascal, Turbo C and Turbo C++ repurposed INT 18 for memory allocation and paging. Other programs also reused this vector for their own purposes.

==BIOS hooks==

=== DOS ===
On DOS systems, IO.SYS or IBMBIO.COM hooks INT 13 for floppy disk change detection, tracking formatting calls, correcting DMA boundary errors, and working around problems in IBM&#x27;s ROM BIOS &quot;01/10/84&quot; with model code 0xFC before the first call.

==Bypassing BIOS==

Many modern operating systems (such as Linux and Windows) do not use any BIOS interrupt calls at all after startup, instead choosing to directly interface with the hardware. To do this, they rely upon drivers that are either a part of the OS kernel itself, ship along with the OS, or are provided by hardware vendors.

There are several reasons for this practice. Most significant is that modern operating systems run with the processor in protected (or long) mode, whereas the BIOS code will only execute in real mode. This means that if an OS running in protected mode wanted to make a BIOS call, it would have to first switch into real mode, then execute the call and wait for it to return, and finally switch back to protected mode. This would be terribly slow and inefficient. Code that runs in real mode (including the BIOS) is limited to accessing just over 1 MiB of memory, due to using 16-bit segmented memory addressing. Additionally, the BIOS is generally not the fastest way to carry out any particular task. In fact, the speed limitations of the BIOS made it common even in the DOS era for programs to circumvent it in order to avoid its performance limitations, especially for video graphics display and fast serial communication.

Beyond the above factors, problems with BIOS functionality include limitations in the range of functions defined, inconsistency in the subsets of those functions supported on different computers, and variations in the quality of BIOSes (i.e. some BIOSes are complete and reliable, others are abridged and buggy). By taking matters into their own hands and avoiding reliance on BIOS, operating system developers can eliminate some of the risks and complications they face in writing and supporting system software. On the other hand, by doing so those developers become responsible for providing &quot;bare-metal&quot; driver software for every different system or peripheral device they intend for their operating system to work with (or for inducing the hardware producers to provide those drivers).

Thus it should be apparent that compact operating systems developed on small budgets would tend to use BIOS heavily, while large operating systems built by huge groups of software engineers with large budgets would more often opt to write their own drivers instead of using BIOS—that is, even without considering the compatibility problems of BIOS and protected mode.

<doc id="1260100" wikidata="Q7627638" url="?curid=1260100" title="Student Bodies">
<text>Student Bodies is a 1981 American parody slasher comedy film written and directed by Mickey Rose, with an uncredited Michael Ritchie co-directing. A spoof of slasher horror films such as &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and &quot;Prom Night&quot;, &quot;Student Bodies&quot; was the first film to satirize the thriving slasher film genre. A prominent feature of the film is a body count that is superimposed onscreen whenever a death occurs.

The film depicts the Breather, a serial killer who stalks and preys on high school students. Eventually, the majority of the film&#x27;s events are depicted as part of the fevered dream of a sexually repressed hospital patient. But the patient&#x27;s boyfriend then turns out to be a Breather-like killer. The patient&#x27;s violent death resembles the scenes from her dreams.

==Plot==
&quot;Student Bodies&quot; is about a serial killer who stalks students at Lamab High School, while at the same time, voyeuristically watching them. The killer calls himself &quot;the Breather&quot;, presumably because the killer is always breathing heavily.

The Breather enjoys stalking victims over the telephone and hates seeing youngsters having sex. The Breather uses many unusual objects to kill his female victims such as a paper clip, a chalkboard eraser and a horsehead bookend.

The film itself ends with several twists: initially, it is revealed that the Principal and his elderly female assistant are working as a duo as &quot;the Breather&quot;, even though they are shown at one point in the film in the same room as other characters when the Breather contacts the school in order to threaten to commit further murders. The film then goes to reveal that the entire film was a fevered dream, caused by the main character Toby being sick and consumed by overwhelming sexual repression. In a send-up of the film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, many characters are revealed to be much the opposite of what they appeared to be for the bulk of the film: the jock-like shop instructor is really the school&#x27;s French teacher, the stuck-up would-be prom queen is actually the school nerd (who is given the crown by Toby after she wakes up, due to her kind nature), the two handicapped kids turn out to be ablebodied, and a local ROTC cadet is a hippie.

After being released from the hospital, Toby and her boyfriend are about to have sex, at which point he puts on gloves similar to the ones worn by the Breather and strangles Toby, as he has lost respect for her. However, in a homage to the nightmare-ending of the film &quot;Carrie&quot;, Toby&#x27;s hands rise up from the freshly dug grave after her funeral to attack her killer.

==Cast==
* Kristen Riter as Toby Badger
* Matt Goldsby as Hardy
* Cullen G. Chambers as Charles Ray
* Jerry Belson as the Breather (credited as Richard Brando)
* Joe Flood as Mr. Dumpkin
* Joe Talarowski as Principal Harlow Hebrew Peters
* Mimi Weddell as Miss Mumsley
* Dario Jones as Mawamba
* Carl Jacobs as Dr. Sigmund
* Peggy Cooper as Ms. Van Dyke
* Janice E. O&#x27;Malley as Nurse Krud
* Kevin Mannis as Scott
* Sara Eckhardt as Patti Priswell
* Oscar James as Football Coach/Sheriff
* Kay Ogden as Ms. Leclair
* &quot;The Stick&quot; as Malvert The Janitor
* Brian Batytis as Wheels
* Joan Browning Jacobs as Mrs. Hummers
* Angela Bressler as Julie
* Keith Singleton as Charlie

==Production==
&quot;Student Bodies&quot; features a cast of true unknowns; most of them, including leads Riter and Goldsby, have never made another feature film. (Riter did appear as a dancer in the J. Geils Band&#x27;s &quot;Centerfold&quot; music video; her resemblance to MTV&#x27;s Martha Quinn led to an urban legend that the VJ was in the video.) Third-billed Cullen Chambers has appeared in numerous films and TV shows since 1981, but his main employment has been as a body double for such actors as Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker. The best-known performer in the film is probably Mimi Weddell, an actress in her 60s who later went on to play several roles on film and TV, including a grandmother in the hit series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. Future Travis County Judge and Texas State Senator Sarah Eckhardt appears in a small role, while comedian Richard Belzer was the voice of the Breather.

Mickey Rose wrote and directed the film, with executive producer Jerry Belson offering additional material; however, Michael Ritchie was placed on set as an overseeing producer to guide Rose should he need it. Some sources say that Ritchie was actually the co-director/writer and had to take the &quot;Alan Smithee&quot; credit due to a strike by the Writers Guild of America; others maintain that he took said credit to distance himself from the project. Mickey Rose was (and is) also a WGA member and received full credit; this would seem to debunk the &quot;union problem&quot; rumors.

===R-rating===
&quot;Student Bodies&quot; contains no sex, nudity, graphic violence or even foul language—until 26 minutes into the film, when the action is interrupted by a man sitting at a desk. He explains that, in order to achieve an R-rating, a film &quot;must contain full frontal nudity, graphic violence, or an explicit reference to the sex act&quot;. He intones that R-rated films are by far the most popular, so &quot;the producers of this motion picture have asked me to take this opportunity to say... &#x27;Fuck you&#x27;&quot;. A slide indicating that the film has been indeed given an R-rating by the MPAA appears for a few seconds (a rare instance of the MPAA rating appearing &quot;during&quot; a film), after which the film continues.

===Parodies===
The film parodies several slasher and horror films, including &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;, &quot;Black Christmas&quot;, &quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;When a Stranger Calls&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and &quot;Prom Night&quot;.

===&quot;The Stick&quot;===
One of the film&#x27;s oddest aspects is a character called Malvert, a creepy-looking janitor (itself a familiar trope in slasher films). Malvert mumbles, does bizarre things like urinate into wastepaper baskets (&quot;Sometimes Malvert pee red!&quot; being one of the film&#x27;s more memorable lines) and moves about in a herky-jerky fashion (at film&#x27;s end, Malvert is revealed to be something of a sophisticate; when Toby informs him that he was a janitor in her dream, he responds, &quot;Absurd!&quot;).

Malvert was played by a tall, double-jointed stand-up comedian known only as &quot;the Stick&quot;, who made no other films; his only other credit seems to be as a guest appearance in the pilot episode on the 1984 TV series &quot;Out of Control&quot;. Several online reviews give the film itself a mixed reaction, but praise the Stick&#x27;s performance.

===Filming locations===
Lamar Consolidated Junior High School in Richmond, Texas – called &quot;Lamab&quot; in the film (not to be confused with Lamar High School in Houston, Texas which is known for its use in the film &quot;Rushmore&quot;) - and James E. Taylor High School in Katy, Texas were used for the film&#x27;s football stadium, as well as for exterior and some interior scenes. The parade scene was filmed in downtown Houston, on Main Street. Additional scenes were filmed on the campus of Texas Southern University, with Hannah Hall (the administration building) used for classroom and hallway shots. Members of TSU&#x27;s football team were also used in the movie.

The 1980 Thomas Jefferson High School Yellow Jackets football team sporting their maroon and gold school colors played the visiting football team in the film.

==Release==
One of a group of films directed towards teenaged audiences during the late 1970s and early 1980s, &quot;Student Bodies&quot; grossed $5.2 million at the box office. It became famous as a late-night cult favorite on cable afterwards, appearing frequently on the Rhonda Shear-hosted USA Up All Night, as well as the network&#x27;s USA Saturday Nightmares double feature series. The DVD was released on June 3, 2007. The HD Blu-ray version was released on May 3, 2011.

==Critical reception==
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a real disappointment&quot;, writing that it &quot;just slowly topples over as you watch it, like a stand-up comedian in the act of failing&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; found that the jokes became &quot;depressingly repetitive&quot;, writing that &quot;unfortunately, once you&#x27;ve seen the trailer, you&#x27;ve seen all but one of the good gags included in the entire film, meaning that there are about three minutes of effective material over the course of the 86-minute running time&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave it two stars out of four, writing that it &quot;exposes all its comic tricks in the first reel, suggesting that the genre itself is not all that deep and that there may be less to parody than one might think&quot;. Linda Gross of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The film has some very funny moments, but it is definitely not another &quot;Airplane!&quot;&quot;. Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;Although it frequently misfires and occasionally keeps firing away on empty satiric chambers, &quot;Student Bodies&quot; is a likeably sarcastic and knowing assault on the clichés of horror movies&quot;. AllMovie wrote, &quot;&quot;Student Bodies&quot;, though occasionally very funny, is not consistent enough to recommend as a comedy or scary enough to be an effective horror film.&quot;

<text>A flexure is a flexible element (or combination of elements) engineered to be compliant in specific degrees of freedom. Flexures are a design feature used by design engineers (usually mechanical engineers) for providing adjustment or compliance in a design.

== Flexure types ==

Most compound flexure designs are composed of three fundamental types of flexure:

* Pin flexure - a thin bar or cylinder of material, constrains three degrees of freedom when geometry matches a notch cutout
* Blade flexure - thin sheet of material, constrains three degrees of freedom
* Notch flexure - thin cutout on both sides of a thick piece of material, constrains five degrees of freedom

Since single flexure features are limited both in travel capability and degrees of freedom available, compound flexure systems are designed using combinations of these component features. Using compound flexures, complex motion profiles with specific degrees of freedom and relatively long travel distances are possible.

== Design aspects ==

In the field of precision engineering (especially high-precision motion control), flexures have several key advantages. High precision alignment tasks might not be possible when friction or stiction are present. Additionally, conventional bearings or linear slides often exhibit positioning hysteresis due to backlash and friction. Flexures are able to achieve much lower resolution limits (in some cases measured in the nanometer scale), because they depend on bending and/or torsion of flexible elements, rather than surface interaction of many parts (as with a ball bearing). This makes flexures a critical design feature used in optical instrumentation such as interferometers.

Due to their mode of action, flexures are used for limited range motions and cannot replace long-travel or continuous-rotation adjustments. Additionally, special care must be taken to design the flexure to avoid material yielding or fatigue, both of which are potential failure modes in a flexure design.

== Design examples ==
* Living hinge: Flexure which acts as a hinge. Preferred for their simplicity, as they can be included as a feature in a single piece of material (as in a Tic Tac box&#x27;s lid).
* Leaf spring: Leaf Springs are commonly used in vehicle suspensions. Leaf springs are an example of a flexure system with one compliant degree of freedom.
* Flex Pivot: Frictionless pivoting component, for use in precision alignment applications.
* NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Rovers and the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity have engineered flexures in their wheels which act as vibration isolation and suspension for the rovers.

<text>Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal covering religion and science published by Wiley-Blackwell. It was established in 1966 and the editor-in-chief is Arthur C. Petersen (University College London). &quot;Zygon&quot; is sponsored by the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science and the Center for Advanced Study in Religion and Science (CASIRAS).

The name &quot;Zygon&quot; (mod. L., ad. ζυγόν Gr. yoke.), according to the journal founder Ralph Wendell Burhoe, is the Greek term for anything that joins two bodies, especially the yoking or harnessing of a team that must pull together effectively. The Zygon is the symbol of the journal, its aim being to reunite the &quot;split team&quot; of values and knowledge.

According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 0.617, ranking it 31st out of 41 journals (Q4) in the category &quot;Social Issues&quot;.

<text>==Events==

===January events===
* January 1 – All major railways in Great Britain are amalgamated into the &quot;Big Four&quot; companies, the Great Western Railway, London &amp; North Eastern Railway, London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway and Southern Railway, under terms of Railways Act 1921.
* January 30 – Canadian National (CN) absorbs the Grand Trunk Railway and spins off the portion of the Grand Trunk within the United States to form the Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTW); CN operates GTW as a subsidiary railroad. National ownership encourages freight rates favoring use of Canadian seaports in the Maritimes, and causes declining freight volumes over the New England line to Grand Trunk seaport facilities in Portland, Maine.

===February events===
* February 7 – London &amp; North Eastern Railway (Great Britain) takes delivery of express passenger 4-6-2 steam locomotive &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; from its Doncaster Works.

===March events===
* March 10 – Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad (United States) takes delivery of its first Y3a Class 2-8-8-2 steam locomotive from ALCO.

===April events===
* April 1 – Yamaguchi Line, Ogori (Shin-Yamaguchi) to Masuda route officially completed in Japan, a direct passenger express service start from October 1961. 

===July events===
* July 6 – Ongarue railway disaster: In New Zealand, about 6:00 am, the southbound Auckland to Wellington express rounds a sharp bend and ploughs into a landslip which had fallen across the railway line near Ongarue, just north of Taumarunui. 17 passengers die and 28 others are injured.
* July 11 – The Ofoten Line in Norway takes electric traction into use.
* July 15 – Warren G. Harding, President of the United States, drives the golden spike on the Alaska Railroad.

* July 18 – In the United States, Fruit Growers Express (FGE) and the Great Northern Railway form the Western Fruit Express (WFE) in order to compete with the Pacific Fruit Express and Santa Fe Refrigerator Despatch in the west.
* July 20 – First Victorian Railways electric locomotive, #1100 built at its Newport Workshops, is placed into freight service in Melbourne, Australia.

===August events===

* August 1 – City of Glasgow (Scotland) takes over operation of the Glasgow Subway.
* August 4 – The Otira Tunnel (8.5 km) on the Midland Line in New Zealand opens, worked by electric traction; construction had started in 1907 and at opening it is the longest in the British Empire (and remains the longest in South Island).
* August 11 – Great Western Railway (Great Britain) places the first of its &#x27;Castle&#x27; Class 4-6-0 express passenger steam locomotives from its Swindon Works, No. 4073 &quot;Caerphilly Castle&quot;, into service.

===September events===
* September 27 – Following soon after the washout of Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad&#x27;s bridge over Coal Creek (near Glenrock, Wyoming), a passenger train falls through the washout, killing 30 of the train&#x27;s 66 passengers. The accident is the worst railroad accident in Wyoming&#x27;s history.

===Unknown date events===
* U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission allows Southern Pacific&#x27;s control of the Central Pacific Railroad to continue, ruling that it is in the public&#x27;s interest.
* Munising, Marquette &amp; Southeastern Railway and Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railway merge to form the Lake Superior &amp; Ishpeming Railroad.
* The Gold Coast Government Railway&#x27;s Accra–Kumasi direct line is completed.

* May 16 – George Jay Gould I, eldest son of Jay Gould, president of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad and the Western Pacific Railroad (born 1864).

=== October deaths ===
* October 25 – Henry Ivatt, Chief Mechanical Engineer of Great Northern Railway of England 1896–1911 (born 1851).

===December deaths===
* December 5 – Sir William Mackenzie, part owner of Toronto Street Railway, builder of Canadian Northern predecessors (born 1849).
* December 10 – Thomas George Shaughnessy, president of Canadian Pacific 1899–1918 (born 1853).

<text>Reading readiness has been defined as the point at which a person is ready to learn to read and the time during which a person transitions from being a non-reader into a reader. Other terms for reading readiness include early literacy and emergent reading.

Children begin to learn pre-reading skills at birth while they listen to the speech around them. In order to learn to read, a child must first have knowledge of the oral language. According to the Ontario Government (2003), the acquisition of language is natural, but the process of learning to read is not—reading must be taught. This belief contradicts basic language philosophy, which states that children learn to read while they learn to speak. The Ontario Government (2003) also believes that reading is the foundation for success, and that those children who struggle with reading in grades 1–3 are at a disadvantage in terms of academic success, compared to those children who are not struggling.

Because a child&#x27;s early experience with literacy-related activities is highly correlated to the child&#x27;s success with reading, it is important to consider a child&#x27;s developmental level when choosing appropriate activities and goals. Early and enjoyable pre-reading experiences set the stage for a child&#x27;s desire to learn. By participating in developmentally-appropriate activities (activities that are fun and challenging, but not frustrating), the child gains knowledge that will serve as the foundation for further learning as he or she enters the school system.

Reading readiness is highly individualistic. There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution to teaching a child to read. A parent or educator may need to employ several techniques before finding the most appropriate method for an individual child. According to Vygotsky&#x27;s Zone of Proximal Development a child can, through the help of an adult or more capable child, perform at a higher level than he or she can independently. The process of learning to read should thus be supported by a caring and supportive individual.

==Reading readiness skills==
Skills that indicate whether a child is ready to learn to read include:

*Age-appropriate oral language development and vocabulary
*Appreciation of stories and books
*Phonemic awareness (ability to distinguish and manipulate individual sounds of language)
*Understanding of basic print concepts (for example, printed text represents spoken words; spaces between words are meaningful; pages written in English are read left to right starting at the top of the page; books have a title and an author, and so on). 
*Understanding of the alphabetic principle (letters represent the sounds of language)
*Ability to distinguish shapes (visual discrimination)
*Ability to identify at least some letters of the alphabet.

==Instructional programs for reading==

Whole language: With this model, language is kept whole rather than segmented into fragments or skills. Within this philosophy, children are expected to learn to read and write in the same manner that they learn to talk. Reading, writing and oral language are considered to be intertwined. Some strategies according to the whole language model include encouraging the child to learn to read by &quot;reading,&quot; and making up stories that they think go along with the pictures in the book. This model also believes that adults should allow the child to witness reading behaviors, such as holding a book properly. It is also important for adults to model these behaviors in an environment that is free from criticism (Matthews, Klassen and Walter, 1999). An early proponent of whole language reading instruction called reading a &quot;psycholinguistic guessing game,&quot; and thus children are taught to guess words that they don&#x27;t know by using context clues. Skipping unknown words is encouraged, and &quot;inventive&quot; spelling is also acceptable.

Phonics: This approach involves teaching the correspondence between graphemes (spelling patterns) and phonemes (sounds).

==Some suggestions for reading skills==

*Read to the child.
*Have the child &quot;read&quot; to you. Allow the child to create their own story based on the pictures they see within the book.
*Reread stories multiple times.
*Omit words of a familiar story and allow the child to fill in the blank.
*Allow the child to experiment with words.
*Point to the words on the page as you read out loud to the child. This enables the child to understand that sentences consist of separate words.

==Influential perspectives==

The two most influential perspectives are the &quot;growth-readiness&quot; view and the &quot;environmentalist&quot; view. The growth-readiness view focuses on the internal workings of the child in order to determine readiness, while environmentalists focus on the external environment. Both internal factors such as genetics and environmental aspects such as school atmosphere can influence a child&#x27;s readiness for reading.
