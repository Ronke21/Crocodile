<text>The Yucatán Peninsula ( , ; ) is a large peninsula in southeast Mexico and adjacent portions of Belize and Guatemala. The peninsula extends towards the northeast, separating the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west of the peninsula from the Caribbean Sea to the east. The Yucatán Channel, between the northeastern corner of the peninsula and Cuba, connects the two bodies of water.

The peninsula is approximately in area. It has low relief and is almost entirely composed of porous limestone.

The peninsula lies east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the narrowest point in Mexico separating the Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, from the Pacific Ocean. Some consider the isthmus to be the geographic boundary between Central America and the rest of North America, placing the peninsula in Central America. Politically, all of Mexico, including the Yucatán, is generally considered part of North America, while Guatemala and Belize are considered part of Central America.

==Etymology==
The proper derivation of the word &quot;Yucatán&quot; is widely debated. 17th-century Franciscan historian Diego López de Cogolludo offers two theories in particular. In the first one, Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, having first arrived to the peninsula in 1517, inquired the name of a certain settlement and the response in Yucatec Mayan was &quot;I don&#x27;t understand&quot;, which sounded like &quot;yucatán&quot; to the Spaniards. There are many possibilities of what the natives could have actually said, among which &quot;&quot;mathan cauyi athán&quot;, &quot;tectecán&quot;, &quot;ma&#x27;anaatik ka t&#x27;ann&quot; and &quot;ci u t&#x27;ann&quot;&quot;. This origin story was first told by Hernán Cortés in his letters to Charles V. Later 16th century historians Motolinia and Francisco López de Gómara also repeat this version. In some versions the expedition is not the one captained by Córdoba but instead the one a year later captained by Juan de Grijalva. The second major theory is that the name is in some way related to the yuca crop, as written by Bernal Díaz del Castillo. Others theories claim that it is a derivative of Chontal Tabascan word &quot;yokat&#x27;an&quot; meaning speaker of the Yoko ochoco language, or an incorrect Nahuatl term &quot;yokatlan&quot; as supposedly &quot;place of richness&quot; (&quot;yohcāuh&quot; cannot be paired with &quot;tlán&quot;).

==History==
===Pre-human===

The Yucatán Peninsula is the site of the Chicxulub crater impact, which was created 66 million years ago by an asteroid of about 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) in diameter at the end of the Cretaceous Period.

===Prehistory===
In 2020, an underwater archaeological expedition led by Jerónimo Avilés excavated Chan Hol cave, near the Tulum archaeological site in the state of Quintana Roo on the peninsula, and revealed the skeleton of a woman approximately 30 years of age who lived at least 9,900 years ago. According to craniometric measurements, the skull is believed to conform to the mesocephalic pattern, like the other three skulls found in Tulum caves. Three different scars on the skull of the woman showed that she was hit with something hard and her skull bones were broken. Her skull also had crater-like deformations and tissue deformities that appeared to be caused by a bacterial relative of syphilis.

According to study lead researcher Wolfgang Stinnesbeck, &quot;It really looks as if this woman had a very hard time and an extremely unhappy end of her life. Obviously, this is speculative, but given the traumas and the pathological deformations on her skull, it appears a likely scenario that she may have been expelled from her group and was killed in the cave, or was left in the cave to die there&quot;.

The newly discovered skeleton was 140 meters away from the Chan Hol 2 site. Although archaeologists assumed the divers had found the remains of the missing Chan Hol 2, the analysis soon proved that these assumptions were erroneous. Stinnesbeck compared the new bones to old photographs of Chan Hol 2 and showed that the two skeletons represent different individuals.

Due to their distinctive features, study co-researcher Samuel Rennie suggest the existence of at least two morphologically diverse groups of people living separately in Mexico during the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene.

===Maya===
The Yucatán Peninsula constitutes a significant proportion of the ancient Maya lowlands and was the central location of the Maya Civilization. The Maya culture also extended south of the Yucatán Peninsula into Guatemala, Honduras, and the highlands of Chiapas. There are many Maya archaeological sites throughout the peninsula; some of the better-known are Chichen Itza, Coba, Tulum, and Uxmal. 

In the 9th century, there was a widespread political collapse in the central Maya region, resulting in civil wars, the abandonment of cities, and a northward shift of population. The Postclassic period saw the rise of Chichen Itza in the north.

===Spanish conquest===

The Spanish conquest of the Maya was a prolonged affair; the Maya kingdoms resisted integration into the Spanish Empire with such tenacity that their defeat took almost two centuries.

With the Caste War of Yucatán, which started in the 1840s, all non-natives were driven from the region. The independent Mayan state of Chan Santa Cruz was conquered by the Mexican federal army in 1901.

Indigenous Maya and Mestizos of partial Maya descent make up a sizable portion of the region&#x27;s population, and Mayan languages are widely spoken there. 

==Geology==
The peninsula is the exposed portion of the larger Yucatán Platform, all of which is composed of carbonate and soluble rocks, being mostly limestone although dolomite and evaporites are also present at various depths. The whole of the Yucatán Peninsula is an unconfined flat lying karst landscape. Sinkholes, known locally as cenotes, are widespread in the northern lowlands.

According to the Alvarez hypothesis, the mass extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs at the transition from the Cretaceous to the Paleogene Period, the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), 66 million years ago was caused by an asteroid impact somewhere in the greater Caribbean Basin. The deeply buried Chicxulub crater is centered off the north coast of the peninsula near the town of Chicxulub. The now-famous &quot;Ring of Cenotes,&quot; a geologic structure composed of sinkholes arranged in a semi-circle, outlines one of the shock-waves from this impact event in the approximately 66-million-year-old rock. The existence of the crater has been supported by evidence including the aforementioned &quot;Ring of Cenotes&quot;, as well as the presence of impact debris such as shocked quartz and tektites, a type of glass formed during meteorite impacts.

The Arrowsmith Bank is a submerged bank located off the northeastern end of the peninsula.

==Climate==
The peninsula has a tropical climate, which ranges from semi-arid in the northwest to humid in the south. Average annual rainfall ranges from less than in the driest parts of the northwest up to in the Petén Basin to the south. Rainfall varies seasonally, with August and September generally the wettest months.

Like much of the Caribbean, the peninsula lies within the Atlantic Hurricane Belt, and with its almost uniformly flat terrain it is vulnerable to these large storms coming from the east, and the area has been devastated by many hurricanes, such as Hurricane Gilbert, Hurricane Emily, Hurricane Wilma, and Hurricane Dean.

Strong storms called &quot;nortes&quot; can quickly descend on the Yucatán Peninsula any time of year. Although these storms pummel the area with heavy rains and high winds, they tend to be short-lived, clearing after about an hour. The average percentage of days with rain per month ranges from a monthly low of 7% in April to a high of 25% in October. Breezes can have a cooling effect, humidity is generally high, particularly in the remaining rainforest areas.

==Water resources==

Due to the extreme karst nature of the whole peninsula, the northern half is devoid of aboveground rivers. Where lakes and swamps are present, the water is marshy and generally unpotable. Due to its coastal location, the whole of the peninsula is underlain by an extensive contiguous density stratified coastal aquifer, where a fresh water lens formed from meteoric water floats on top of intruding saline water from the coastal margins. The thousands of sinkholes known as cenotes throughout the region provide access to the groundwater system. The cenotes have long been relied on by ancient and contemporary Maya people.

==Ecology==
The vegetation and plant communities of the peninsula vary from north to south. The Yucatán dry forests occupy the dry northwestern peninsula, and include dry forests and scrublands and cactus scrub. The Yucatán moist forests occur across the middle and east of the peninsula, and are characterized by semi-deciduous forests where 25 to 50% of the trees lose their leaves during the summer dry season. The Belizian pine forests are found in several enclaves across central Belize. The southernmost portion of the peninsula is in the Petén–Veracruz moist forests ecoregion, an evergreen rain forest.

Northern Guatemala (El Petén), Mexico (Campeche and Quintana Roo), and western Belize are still occupied by the largest continuous tracts of tropical rainforest in Central America. However, these forests are suffering extensive deforestation.

Mangroves occur along the coast, with the Usumacinta mangroves around the Laguna de Términos in the southwest, the Petenes mangroves along the west coast, Ría Lagartos mangroves along the northern shore of the peninsula, and the Mayan Corridor mangroves and Belizean Coast mangroves to the east along the Caribbean Sea.

The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System is an immense coral barrier reef which stretches over along the eastern coast of the peninsula.

==Governance==
The peninsula comprises the Mexican states of Yucatán, Campeche, and Quintana Roo, as well as Guatemala&#x27;s Petén Department and almost all of Belize.

==Economy==

In the late historic and early modern eras, the Yucatán Peninsula was largely a cattle ranching, logging, chicle and henequen production area. Since the 1970s, the Yucatán Peninsula has reoriented its economy towards tourism, especially in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Aside from tourism, another source of income that is important in the Peninsula is logging as well as chicle industries specifically in Belize. Oil was also found in certain parts of the Yucatán, bringing in more economic opportunities. Once a small fishing village, Cancún in the northeast of the peninsula has grown into a thriving city. The Riviera Maya, which stretches along the east coast of the peninsula between Cancún and Tulum, houses over 50,000 beds. The best-known locations are the former fishing town of Playa del Carmen, the ecological parks Xcaret and Xel-Há and the Maya ruins of Tulum and Coba.

==Population==

The population of the Yucatán Peninsula is very different throughout each part of the Peninsula. Population density and ethnic composition are two factors that play into the total population. The most populated area is Mérida in Yucatán state and the surrounding region, contrasted by the state of Quintana Roo, the least populated part of the peninsula. In terms of ethnic composition, a majority of the population consisted of both Maya and Mestizos.

<text>The Dodge Ram Van (also known as the Dodge B-series) is a range of full-size vans that were produced by Chrysler Corporation from the 1971 to 2003 model years. Replacing the Dodge A100, the Ram Van transitioned to a front-engine drivetrain configuration. Mostly offered as a cargo van and a passenger van, the model line was also initially offered as a cutaway van chassis. 

The B-series van line was produced across 32 years of production, making it among the longest-lived platform designs in American automotive history. Much of the exterior and chassis underpinnings saw only gradual changes during their entire production, with three distinct generations developed. Alongside its use by Dodge, the full-size van range saw rebranding during the 1970s for both Fargo Trucks and Plymouth (marking the debut of the Plymouth Voyager nameplate). 

For much of its entire production run, Chrysler produced B-platform vans at the now-demolished Pillette Road Truck Assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, Canada; prior to 1980, the model line was also produced at Saint Louis North Assembly (Fenton, Missouri). In 2003, the Dodge Sprinter (a rebranding of its Mercedes-Benz namesake) was introduced, replacing the B-series van entirely from 2004 to 2009. Since 2014, the Ram division has offered the ProMaster to the full-size van market, a rebranded Fiat Ducato.

==Model overview==
Built on the B platform (later AB), the Dodge full-size vans entered production for the 1971 model year. Using a one-welded-piece &quot;Uniframe&quot; design, the platform was lighter and stronger, giving a lower cargo floor than previous American designs. While at the expense of noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH), the resulting lower center of gravity improved handling versus competing products with full frames. 

Produced over three distinct generations, the B-series van utilized the majority of body sheetmetal from 1971 to 2003. Alongside passenger and cargo vans, the model line also served as a basis for cutaway chassis during the 1970s, serving both commercial markets and as a basis for recreational vehicles. Though popular in the latter market, Chrysler Corporation would end production of that design as a consequence of its late 1970s financial difficulties. 

The relatively limited changes for the model line across its production made the Dodge Ram van popular with fleet buyers, service companies, and upbuilders because of the compatibility of components across various model years.

In two size extremes to the market segment, Dodge was the first American manufacturer to popularize extended-length passenger vans, with the 1971 &quot;Maxiwagon&quot; introducing 15-passenger seating. Conversely, the Ram van was the final full-size short-wheelbase van, as the 109-inch wheelbase B1500 was offered through 2003. 

== First generation (1971–1978) ==

From 1971 to 1978, Dodge produced two models of the B-series van: the Dodge Tradesman cargo van and the Dodge Sportsman passenger van. In line with the D-series pickup truck (which underwent a final redesign for 1972), the van was marketed with three payload series: ½-ton &quot;100&quot;, ¾-ton &quot;200&quot;, and 1-ton &quot;300&quot;. Only five inches longer than its A100/A108 predecessor, moving the front axle forward allowed for a substantial increase in interior space.

Dodge introduced the Tradesman and Sportsman in two wheelbases: 109 inches and 127 inches. Initially introduced in two body lengths, an extended-length &quot;Maxivan/Maxiwagon&quot; variant was introduced during 1971. Consisting of an 18-inch rear body extension, the Sportsman Maxiwagon could be fitted with four rows of rear seats, allowing for up to 15 passengers. While the Tradesman was offered strictly as a cargo van, the Sportsman was offered in three distinct trims: Sportsman, Custom Sportsman, and Royal Sportsman, with the latter rivaling the Dodge Royal Monaco station wagon in equipment and trim. 

Along with its highly sloped hoodline and short front fenders, this generation of the B-series van is distinguished by several exterior design features. On passenger vans with the 127-inch wheelbase, the front passenger door and the rear side doors are separated by a filler panel (with a small window), with all body lengths (including the Maxiwagon) sharing the same side glass. The side windows are smaller in size, sharing a beltline with the front door glass. 

Sharing its powertrain with the Dodge D-series pickup truck (redesigned for 1972), the van line was initially released with a 198 cubic-inch Slant-6 along with a 225 cubic-inch Slant-6 and a 318 cubic-inch V8. For 1972, the 198 was dropped with a 360 V8 becoming a second optional V8. For 1976, B200 and B300 vans gained the option of big-block 400 and 440 cubic-inch V8s. A three-speed manual was standard, with the options of a 4-speed manual (added in 1976) and a 3-speed automatic. 

During its production, the first-generation vans saw gradual changes added each year. For 1972, front disc brakes were added along with full chrome door handles (replacing black push buttons). For 1973, electronic ignition replaced the previous points-type system and power brakes became standard. For 1974, a redesigned plastic grille was added (moving the Dodge lettering to the hood). To better match its Ford and GM competitors, the model line received a sliding door; initially offered on Maxivans/Maxiwagons, the configuration later became an option for the entire model line. For 1975, an optional single-piece rear door became an option for Sportsman vans; the side-opening door remained unique to the B-series line through the end of its production. 1976 saw the launch of the Street Van customization package for Tradesman vans (see below), with minor interior revisions; in 1977, the single-panel rear door became standard on all Sportsman vans.

For 1978, the B-series van began a two-year transition towards its second generation. Much of the body behind of the rear doors was revised, deleting the filler panel of long-wheelbase vans; the side and rear windows now extended slightly below the beltline of the front doors; and the taillamps were enlarged, switching from a horizontal orientation to a vertical one. The interior underwent a major revision with an all-new dashboard, trim, and seats; upgraded interior controls were now shared with Chrysler cars. In another revision, smaller engine covers increased space for front-seat passengers. The extended-length Maxivan/Maxivan was now a 26-inch extension, with the Maxiwagon receiving wraparound corner windows to improve visibility. 

===Rebranding===

During the last two years of its existence, Fargo offered a rebadged variant of the Tradesman and Sportsman in Canada for 1971 and 1972 only. Plymouth also received a rebadged variant of the Sportsman, called the Voyager for the 1974 model year. While never as popular as the Dodge version, Plymouth marketed the Voyager in this format through 1983, after which the nameplate was transferred to the new minivan that was introduced for 1984 as a rebadged Dodge Caravan.

==Second generation (1979–1997)==

For 1979, Dodge completed the two-year transition to its second-generation B-series vans, with the front portion of the body undergoing a redesign. The front fascia received a taller hoodline and grille (styled in line with Dodge Ram pickup trucks), with parking lamps wrapping into the front fenders. Higher-trim Sportsman vans were fitted with four rectangular headlamps while lower-trim versions (and Tradesman cargo vans) were fitted with dual round headlamps. 

In a change that would prove beneficial to Chrysler, the government reclassified the Sportsman passenger van as a truck (instead of a passenger car), substantially increasing the ability of the company to meet CAFE implementation. 

After 1980, production ended at Saint Louis North Assembly (retooled to produce the Chrysler K cars), with all production subsequently sourced from Pillette Road Truck Assembly.

=== Model changes ===
For 1980, the windows were revised, with sliding side doors receiving a single-pane window (in line with the single-panel rear door). For 1981, the model line underwent a major rebranding. In line with its pickup truck counterpart (which became the Dodge Ram pickup), the Dodge Tradesman and Sportsman nameplates were retired in favor of Dodge Ram Van and Wagon; the B-series nomenclature remained, revised to B150, B250, and B350. Derived from the B150, the Mini-Ram was a higher-trim passenger van with a larger fuel tank. 

For 1984, the Dodge Mini Ram and the Plymouth Voyager were retired from the B-series line, as both nameplates became part of the Chrysler minivan line; Plymouth would not again offer a full-size truck prior to its discontinuation. 

For 1986, the grille and badging trim were revised in line with Ram pickup trucks. In a safety upgrade, outboard seating positions received 3-point seatbelts for 1992.

For 1994, the model line underwent its most substantial revision since 1978. Distinguished by new front sheetmetal (adopting a grille styled in line with the redesigned Dodge Ram pickup trucks), the body shell underwent structural enhancements to improve crash protection. To modernize its appearance, exterior chrome brightwork was reduced (limited to the bumpers and grille). While the dashboard introduced for 1978 remained carryover, the interior saw revisions to the door panels and seats. In a branding change, the van line adopted the nomenclature of the Dodge Ram pickup trucks, becoming the B1500, B2500, and B3500. For 1995, a driver-side airbag was added.

=== Powertrain details ===
For the second-generation Ram vans, several changes were made to the powertrain line. Following the retirement of the big-block 400 and 440 V8s by Chrysler, the 360 V8 now served as the largest-displacement engine (doing so through 2003).

The long-running 225 Slant-Six returned as the standard engine (later advertised in its 3.7 L metric displacement); in 1988, it was replaced by a 3.9 L LA V6 adopted from the Dodge Dakota. The 318 (later 5.2 L) returned as the standard V8 option, adopting fuel injection for 1988 (the 5.9 L V8 doing so for 1989). For 1992, the &quot;Magnum&quot; generation of the 3.9 L and 5.2 L engines was introduced, featuring multiport fuel injection; the 5.9 L followed suit for 1993.

For 1979, Dodge planned to offer the Mitsubishi 4.0 L (243 CID) inline-six diesel engine (offered as an option on Dodge pickup trucks), but the option was shelved.

For 1980, the 3-speed column-shifted manual was retired in favor of the overdrive-equipped 4-speed (floor-shifted) manual. For 1988, the standard transmission became a 5-speed manual (with the 3.9 L V6); a 4-speed automatic became optional for the V6 and the 5.2 L V8, with a heavy-duty 4-speed automatic for the 5.9 L V8 added in 1990. As part of the 1994 update, manual transmissions were discontinued; Dodge became the final full-size van line to standardize automatic transmissions.

==== CNG powertrain ====
In 1991, Chrysler began development of a CNG-fueled version of the Ram Van, using the 5.2 L V8. After a short initial prototype production period, the variant was launched into larger-scale production for 1992; approximately 2,000 were produced primarily for fleet sales. From 1994 to 1998, Chrysler continued development with CNG powertrains using the Dodge Caravan.

==Third generation (1998–2003)==
For 1998, the third-generation B-series van was released. The most substantial revision of the model line since 1971, the body structure was upgraded to improve crash protection. Along with further reinforcement of the bodyshell, the powertrain was relocated further forward in the chassis (though wheelbases remained carryover), requiring a longer hood and front fenders. 

Alongside the chassis upgrades, the interior underwent its first major redesign since 1978. Coinciding with its relocation forward, the engine cover was reduced in size, increasing space both between the front seats and for both front-seat passengers. The dashboard was redesigned, both to allow for the introduction of dual airbags and shared componentry with contemporary Chrysler vehicles. The front doors were distinguished by the deletion of the front vent windows, with the sideview mirrors relocated in their place (shared with the Dodge Ram/Dodge Dakota, bringing power-operated mirrors for the first time). To free up interior cargo space, the spare tire was moved from the interior to an underfloor location. 

Through its production, the third-generation van saw few functional changes following its 1998 introduction. Carrying over the 3.9 L V6, 5.2 L V8, and 5.9 L V8 from the 1994 model revision, a 3-speed automatic was paired with the V6 and a 4-speed automatic was paired with the V8 engines.
== Variants ==

=== Street van ===

Dodge vans, particularly Tradesman vans from the 1971–1977 model years, were very popular as the basis for many custom vans during the custom van craze that occurred during the mid- to late 1970s and early 1980s. Dodge capitalized on this craze, creating a factory customization package called the &quot;Street Van&quot; package. 

This was advertised alongside the Lil&#x27; Red Express and Warlock trucks as &quot;Adult Toys.&quot; The Street Van package consisted of a &quot;Street Van&quot; logo on the passenger and driver&#x27;s side door in lieu of the Tradesman logos, chrome trim on the grille and windshield, simulated wood grain inlays in the steering wheel horn cover and passenger-side glare shield, five-slot chrome wheels or white spoked &quot;off-road&quot; type wheels, chrome front and rear bumpers, chrome trim on the gauges, smaller chrome side-view mirrors, patterns and plans to create custom interiors, and membership in the &quot;Dodge Van Clan.&quot; 

For 1976 and 1977 only, the YH3 Street Van could be ordered with a single driver seat, no dash pad, plain steering wheel, and Street Van door decal delete. The decals were placed in the glovebox at time of manufacture. Most of these were sent to conversion companies to be customized to customer specification. This package was available from the 1976 model year until it was discontinued in the early 1980s.This was not an overly popular option from the factory, and Street Vans are somewhat rare. The chrome-plated metal Street Van emblems found on later Street Vans (emblems through mid-1978 were stickers) in good shape are quite valuable to collectors or restorers.

===Kary Van===

For 1973, Dodge introduced the Kary Van variant of the B-series. A factory-produced cutaway van fitted with a cube van rear body, the Kary Van was produced in 10- and 12-foot lengths and two widths (derived from single- or dual-rear-wheel axle configuration).

Derived from the B300 Tradesman, the cutaway body of the Kary Van would also serve as a basis underpinning bodies for Type C recreational vehicles during the 1970s. In 1979, Chrysler ended production of the variant in response to its financial difficulties.

=== Dodge 50 series ===
The Dodge 50 series is a light commercial vehicle that was built by Chrysler Europe (and later Renault Trucks) from 1979 to 1993. Using the cab assembly of the 1971–1978 Dodge Kary Van, the Dodge 50 mated the American-designed cab with a British-designed chassis. The model line was powered by Peugeot/Renault gasoline engines and Perkins 4-cylinder diesel engines. 

Following the collapse of Chrysler Europe, the model line continued to be manufactured by Renault, which phased out the Dodge branding entirely after 1987. After 1993, Renault phased out the model line in favor of its own Renault Master. 

== Nameplate revival ==

In 2012, Chrysler&#x27;s Ram brand revived the Tradesman nameplate as the Dodge Grand Caravan C/V cargo van was rebranded as the Ram C/V Tradesman. Sold only as a two-passenger cargo van, the Tradesman replaced the rear side windows with metal panels and was fitted with a flat rear load floor. After 2015, the Ram ProMaster City (based on the Fiat Doblò) replaced the C/V Tradesman.

<text>Shahid Beheshti University (SBU) (), originally founded as the Melli University (National University of Iran) (), is a public research university in Tehran, Iran. The university offers programs at Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s and Ph.D. levels.

==History==
Shahid Behesti University was founded in 1959 by Ali Sheikholislam. The university was planned to be devoted to graduate studies. At its opening, it consisted of two schools: Architecture and Urban Planning, and Banking and Economics, with 174 students. Soon the School of Literature and Foreign Languages began in downtown Tehran. The first graduate academic degree program was the Master&#x27;s course in the School of Architecture, launched in 1961. In 1962, a new main campus was built in Evin, a suburb in the north of Tehran. By 1978 other faculties became active i.e.the faculties of Literature and Human Sciences, Basic Sciences, Law, Earth Sciences, Statistics and Informatics and Education and Psychology. In an academic reform in 1986, the medical schools were separated from the main universities and became Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences working under the purview of the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education. The first PhD course was offered in the School of Economics in 1991.

Shahid Beheshti University has been sanctioned by governments in the EU, US, Australia, Canada, and Switzerland for their links to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. This restricts business and financial transactions with the university, in some cases including its students.

<text>Edwin Torres (born 1958) is a Nuyorican performance poet. His work incorporates vocal and physical improvisation. He is the author of &quot;Ameriscopia&quot;, &quot;One Night: Poems for the Sleepy&quot;, &quot;Yes Thing No Thing&quot;, and several other poetic books. He also has produced recordings titled &quot;Oceano Rise&quot;, &quot;Novo&quot;, and &quot;Holy Kid&quot;. He is a member of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E school.

==Early years==
Torres&#x27;s parents moved from Puerto Rico and settled in the borough of The Bronx in New York City. His father died when he was young and he was then raised by his mother and her brother Martin. He received his primary and secondary education in New York.

==Nuyorican Poets Cafe==

In 1989 Torres began working as a graphic designer and a year later he discovered the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which inspired his creative instincts. Torres created a movement which he called &quot;Interactive Eclectrcism&quot;, which combines movement, audience participation, music and songs. The Nuyorican Poets Cafe not only opened its door for his creation but it also opened the doors to a new world of reading poetry. Torres also created the &quot;Poets Neurotica&quot;, where dancers and musicians performed alongside two to four poets. He was a member of &quot;Real Live Poetry&quot; from 1993–99, performing and conducting workshops across the US and overseas.

Torres has represented New York in the 1992 National Poetry Slam, celebrated in Boston, and he has won the Nuyorican Poets Cafe First Annual Prize for Poetry with his poem &quot;Po-Mo Griot&quot;.

He has also appeared on MTV&#x27;s Spoken Word Unplugged and the Charlie Rose Show and been featured on Newsweek, in Rolling Stone Magazine and in New York Magazine. His poem, &quot;I Saw Your Empire State Building&quot; was included in the book, &quot;Words In Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam&quot; in the chapter which dealt with the poetry slam community&#x27;s response to 9/11, and his work has appeared in numerous anthologies such as &quot;Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets Cafe&quot;, &quot;Short Fuse: The Global Anthology of New Fusion Poetry&quot;, and &quot;Heights of the Marvelous: A New York Anthology&quot;, among many others.

==Other performances==
Besides performing at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, Torres has performed at the Guggenheim Museum, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Museum of Modern Art, amongst other venues.

<doc id="1248374" wikidata="Q731721" url="?curid=1248374" title="Plastic Ono Band">
<text>The Plastic Ono Band was a rock band and Fluxus-based artist collective formed by John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1968-9 for their collaborative musical and sound art projects, films, conceptual art projects and eventual solo LPs. The creation of the Plastic Ono Band, which began in 1967 with Ono&#x27;s idea for an art exhibition in Berlin, allowed Lennon to separate his artistic output from that of the Beatles.

Lennon and Ono began a personal and artistic relationship in 1968, collaborating on several experimental releases. After their marriage in 1969, they decided their future endeavours would be credited to the Plastic Ono Band. The band featured a rotating line-up of musicians including Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann, Alan White, Billy Preston, Jim Keltner, Keith Moon, Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends, and Lennon&#x27;s former Beatles bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr. After Lennon and Ono moved to New York in 1971, they collaborated with Elephant&#x27;s Memory under the name &quot;Plastic Ono Elephant&#x27;s Memory Band&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s collaborations continued under similar names until 1974.

From 2009 to 2015, Ono and her son Sean Lennon led a new incarnation of the group, the Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band.

==History==
===Origins and formation (1968–1969)===

John Lennon and Yoko Ono met in 1966. Lennon was a member of the Beatles, and Ono was an avant-garde artist and performer. By 1968, the two established a romantic relationship and they began collaborating on a number of musical projects.

The Plastic Ono Band name, and its Fluxus idea of an open-ended plastic band, was conceived of by Ono in 1967 as an idea for an art exhibition in Berlin. The Plastic Ono Band was realized in 1968 as a multi-media machine maquette by John Lennon, also called &quot;The Plastic Ono Band&quot;. In 1968, Lennon and Ono began a personal and artistic relationship in which they decided to credit their future endeavours as the work of The Plastic Ono Band. Ono and Lennon collaborated on several art exhibitions, concerts, happenings and experimental noise music recording projects, before recording and releasing somewhat more standard rock-based albums that were still connected to the Plastic Ono Band concept.

They recorded together in May 1968; these recordings would be released in November as the experimental album &quot;Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins&quot;. The pair worked throughout the summer on &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, an experimental piece that appeared on the Beatles&#x27; self-titled double album (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;). In December 1968, Lennon and Ono appeared together at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus with a supergroup named &quot;The Dirty Mac&quot;, consisting of Eric Clapton, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and violinist Ivry Gitlis. Lennon and Ono continued with their experimental releases parallel to Lennon&#x27;s activities in the Beatles, releasing &quot;Unfinished Music No. 2: Life with the Lions&quot; in May 1969.

On 20 March 1969, Lennon and Ono married, and subsequently hosted their first &quot;Bed-in for Peace&quot; event. The event saw them using press coverage of their marriage to advocate for peace. Recordings made around this time were released as their third and final experimental album, &quot;Wedding Album&quot;. The Plastic Ono Band moniker was first used on 12 May, when Lennon and Ono participated in George Harrison&#x27;s mixing session for &quot;Jam Peace&quot; – a jam that Harrison had recorded during a session with Apple Records artist Billy Preston. The track was subsequently titled &quot;I Remember Jeep&quot; and the artist credit on the EMI tape box was changed to George Harrison for inclusion on the bonus disc of his 1970 solo album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.

During the second bed-in, held in Montreal in late May and early June 1969, Lennon, Ono and their guests recorded the Lennon-penned song &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; and Ono&#x27;s &quot;Remember Love&quot;. These were released on 4 July as a single credited to the Plastic Ono Band. It was the first single released by Lennon outside of the Beatles, with whom he was still active. Although an independent composition and release by Lennon, his Beatles writing partner Paul McCartney was still credited, as both a contractual and personal agreement of sharing credit. There is written and photographic evidence to suggest, however, that the original Plastic Ono Band was a sound and light installation set up in the Apple press office. In the 26 July 1969 edition of &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot;, Derek Taylor, the Beatles press officer, wrote the following article:
The band was made in perspex in Hoylake, in Cheshire (where Selwyn Lloyd and I were brought up separately) by an inventor I know called Charles Melling. It was Yoko&#x27;s idea, with John, made to her specifications; four pieces – like John, Paul, George and Ringo, three taller and one shorter. Two rectangular, one cylindrical and a cube. One column holds a tape-recorder and amplifier, another a closed circuit TV set with live camera, a third a record player with amplifier, and the fourth has a miniature light show and a loud speaker. But they could hold anything, they are as adaptable as the Beatles. The perspex columns were fitted with their equipment by Apple electronics under the direction of (Magic) Alexis Mardas and here ends the first and last technological press release you will have from me.

The single was preceded by a press launch for the Plastic Ono Band on 3 July. According to Ono, the name was coined by Lennon as a result of Ono&#x27;s use of plastic stands for recording. Press material outlined the &quot;band&quot; as a conceptual movement, not limited to a strict membership like a normal group. Lennon and Ono stated that the audience were members, with the accompanying slogan &quot;YOU are the Plastic Ono Band&quot;.

===Toronto Rock Revival Festival and early singles (1969–1970)===
The Plastic Ono Band remained dormant for most of the summer of 1969 as the Beatles worked on completing &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. On 12 September, Lennon received a call from John Brower, organizer of the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival (set to occur the following day), offering Lennon free attendance to the festival in order to boost its profile. Lennon offered instead to perform at the festival. Brower agreed, and Lennon quickly assembled a band. He initially approached Beatles bandmate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison turned him down. On Harrison&#x27;s recommendation, Lennon recruited Eric Clapton for the role; bassist Klaus Voormann and drummer Alan White filled out the first performing line-up of the Plastic Ono Band. While organising the band, Lennon privately decided to leave the Beatles, due to longstanding tensions in the group. The band rehearsed on the plane to Toronto, and performed both rock songs sung by Lennon and experimental pieces led by Ono. A recording of the show was released in December as &quot;Live Peace in Toronto 1969&quot;, the first LP credited to the Plastic Ono Band.

In late September, the Plastic Ono Band began recording their next single. &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; had been initially presented by Lennon as a potential Beatles single, but this was rejected by McCartney. &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; and its B-side &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Kyoko (Mummy&#x27;s Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)&quot; featured a Plastic Ono Band almost identical to the Toronto line-up except White was replaced by Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. The writing credit for &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; contained only Lennon&#x27;s name, reflecting his split with McCartney and the Beatles.

Following the release of the &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; single, Lennon began preparations for a follow-up. On 26 November, he mixed &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s the New Mary Jane&quot;, for release as a single. Both songs were old Beatles recordings. &quot;You Know My Name&quot; dated initially from 1967, with further work by Lennon and McCartney in 1969. The B-side was a 1968 Lennon song recorded by him, Harrison and Ono, and originally intended for inclusion on the White Album. The single was put on hold by EMI, and was ultimately cancelled, possibly due to objections from the Beatles.

On 15 December, the Plastic Ono Band took part in a benefit concert for UNICEF at the Lyceum Ballroom in London, titled &quot;Peace for Christmas&quot;. With 48 hours&#x27; notice, Lennon and Ono assembled the Toronto line-up of Clapton, Voormann and White; Clapton brought along Harrison, Billy Preston and the Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends touring group, with whom they were touring at the time. In addition to Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, the group included saxophonist Bobby Keys, drummer Jim Gordon and trumpet player Jim Price. Keith Moon of the Who also joined the performance. Lennon later referred to this line-up as &quot;the Plastic Ono Supergroup&quot;. Following the Lyceum show, Lennon and Ono engaged in a media blitz and advertising campaign for peace, taking out billboards in major cities saying &quot;WAR IS OVER! If You Want It – Happy Christmas from John &amp; Yoko&quot;.

1970 saw the Plastic Ono Band reconvening to record another single, &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;, that was written and recorded on January 27th, 1970. Lennon, Ono, George Harrison, Klaus Voormann, Alan White and Billy Preston, along with backing vocalists recruited from a nearby pub, composed the Plastic Ono Band for the session. On Harrison&#x27;s suggestion, American producer Phil Spector was hired, beginning a working relationship that extended for several years into both his and Lennon&#x27;s careers. &quot;Instant Karma!&quot;, backed with Ono&#x27;s &quot;Who Has Seen the Wind?&quot;, was released just over a week later. The single was credited to &quot;Lennon/Ono with the Plastic Ono Band&quot;, in contrast to earlier releases, which were credited to the band alone.

===&quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; albums to &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; (1970–1971)===
During the summer of 1970, Lennon and Ono undertook primal therapy under the guidance of Arthur Janov in Los Angeles. This therapy had a great effect on Lennon&#x27;s writing. In the meantime, the Beatles had publicly broken up, and the pair returned to London at the end of September to begin recording on a pair of studio albums, &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; and &quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot;. The core of the Plastic Ono Band backing the two was Klaus Voormann on bass and Ringo Starr on drums. Phil Spector co-produced Lennon&#x27;s record, and he and Billy Preston played keyboards on some tracks. George Harrison contributed sitar to Ono&#x27;s album. Lennon&#x27;s record consisted of straightforward, stripped down rock, while Ono&#x27;s featured experimental and avant-garde music. Both albums were released on 11 December. The single &quot;Mother&quot; / &quot;Why&quot; was issued, the songs coming from &quot;John Lennon&quot; and &quot;Yoko Ono&quot; respectively. In early 1971, Lennon recorded &quot;Power to the People&quot; with a line-up of Billy Preston, Bobby Keys, Klaus Voormann and Alan White. Ono&#x27;s B-side &quot;Open Your Box&quot; featured Voormann and Jim Gordon. The single was released in March, with the sides credited to &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; and &quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot; respectively.

In the spring and summer of 1971, Lennon and Ono recorded their respective albums &quot;Imagine&quot; and &quot;Fly&quot;. Using the same &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; and &quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot; artist credits, the albums featured contributions from George Harrison, Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Alan White, Jim Keltner and Jim Gordon, and Phil Spector co-produced &quot;Imagine&quot;. On 6 June, Lennon and Ono performed with Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention in New York City, later dubbing the collaboration &quot;John &amp; Yoko/Plastic Ono Band with The Mothers of Invention&quot;.

The next use of the Plastic Ono Band name was the 1971 Christmas single &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot;. Credited to &quot;John &amp; Yoko/The Plastic Ono Band&quot;, the recording featured drummer Jim Keltner, pianist Nicky Hopkins and guitarists Hugh McCracken, Chris Osbourne (who had played on &quot;Fly&quot;), Teddy Irwin and Stuart Scharf. The B-side, &quot;Listen, the Snow Is Falling&quot;, featured the same musicians as &quot;Happy Xmas&quot;, with the addition of Klaus Voormann on bass. Co-produced by Phil Spector, the single was issued on 1 December.

===Move to New York: Plastic Ono Band with Elephant&#x27;s Memory (1971–1973)===

Lennon and Ono left the UK to settle in New York City during the fall of 1971. In Greenwich Village, the couple became more politically active and began writing protest songs. These songs became the basis for their next album, &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot;. As backing, they enlisted the help of New York band Elephant&#x27;s Memory, consisting of guitarist Wayne &#x27;Tex&#x27; Gabriel, bassist Gary Van Scyoc, saxophonist Stan Bronstein, keyboardist Adam Ippolito, keyboardist John La Boosca, and drummer Richard Frank Jr. Phil Spector co-produced, and Jim Keltner also played on the album. The album was released on 12 June 1972, credited to &quot;John &amp; Yoko/Plastic Ono Band with Elephant&#x27;s Memory plus Invisible Strings&quot;. &quot;Some Time in New York City&quot; included a second disc, titled &quot;Live Jam&quot;, consisting of the recordings from the 1969 Peace for Christmas concert and, with bass overdubs by Klaus Voormann, the 1971 performance with Frank Zappa.

Ono and Lennon continued to work with Elephant&#x27;s Memory throughout 1972. On 30 August, as the Plastic Ono Elephant&#x27;s Memory Band (which also included Jim Keltner), they performed two &quot;One to One&quot; benefit concerts at Madison Square Garden. The event was organised by Geraldo Rivera to raise money for children with mental challenges. By this time, La Boosca had left Elephant&#x27;s Memory, and the concerts saw the addition of John Ward on bass. The shows were filmed and recorded, and released in February 1986 as the album &quot;Live in New York City&quot;. They also performed at the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot;.

The last collaboration between the Plastic Ono Band and Elephant&#x27;s Memory was Ono&#x27;s double album &quot;Approximately Infinite Universe&quot;. It was recorded throughout the fall of 1972, and was released in January 1973.

===Lennon&#x27;s split with Ono and the Lost Weekend (1973–1974)===
By the beginning of 1973, recording had begun on Ono&#x27;s next album, &quot;Feeling the Space&quot;, featuring a new group of studio musicians. This incarnation of the Plastic Ono Band featured guitarist David Spinozza, keyboardist Ken Ascher, bassist Gordon Edwards, percussionists Arthur Jenkins and David Friedman, saxophonist Michael Brecker, pedal steel guitarist Sneaky Pete Kleinow, as well as regular contributor Jim Keltner. The album was released in November.

Throughout 1973, Lennon and Ono&#x27;s relationship became strained. By August, the two had begun a period of separation that Lennon called &quot;the Lost Weekend&quot;. Lennon recorded &quot;Mind Games&quot;, using the same players as on &quot;Feeling the Space&quot;, dubbed &quot;the Plastic U.F.Ono Band&quot;. Around the time of the album&#x27;s release in November, Lennon moved to Los Angeles with new lover May Pang. In October, Lennon began the recording of an album of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll oldies (a contractual obligation due to a lawsuit). The sessions featured many Plastic Ono Band regulars (including much of the &quot;U.F.Ono Band&quot;, Klaus Voormann, and Phil Spector as producer), but when released in 1975 as &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, the album was credited to Lennon alone.

The sessions for &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; were extremely troubled and were abandoned until a later date. In July 1974, Lennon returned to New York to record &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;. The new &quot;Plastic Ono Nuclear Band&quot; featured Jim Keltner, Kenneth Ascher and Arthur Jenkins continuing from &quot;Mind Games&quot;, the returns of Klaus Voormann, Nicky Hopkins and Bobby Keys, and the addition of guitarists Jesse Ed Davis and Eddie Mottau. Recording was completed in August, and the album was released in September.

&quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; was the last release of new material by the Plastic Ono Band in the 1970s. Lennon subsequently returned to his marriage with Ono and retired from music following the birth of his son Sean in October 1975. That same month, Lennon issued the compilation &quot;Shaved Fish&quot;, his last release to be credited to the Plastic Ono Band.

===Revival (2009–2015)===
In 2009, Yoko Ono revived the Plastic Ono Band name with the 2009 EP &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me!&quot;, a preview of the album &quot;Between My Head and the Sky&quot;. Both albums, and subsequent activities, are credited to the &quot;Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band&quot;. The core members of the new Plastic Ono Band were Sean Lennon (the son of Ono and Lennon), Cornelius (Keigo Oyamada) and Yuka Honda. From 2009, the band performed live concerts, with additional members including bassist Shimmy Hirotaka Shimizu, horn player Michael Leonhart, cellist Erik Friedlander and drummer Yuko Araki. They also performed with many guest performers, including Kim Gordon, Thurston Moore, Bette Midler, Lady Gaga, Mark Ronson, Scissor Sisters, Harper Simon, Paul Simon and Gene Ween.

In 2010, at a concert titled &quot;We Are the Plastic Ono Band&quot;, Ono and Sean Lennon reunited with Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. In 2011, Ono and Lennon collaborated with the Flaming Lips on an EP entitled &quot;The Flaming Lips with Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot;. The latest release from the Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band is the 2013 album &quot;Take Me to the Land of Hell&quot;. The Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band continued to make live appearances into 2015.

<text>Anthony Lawrence Azevedo (born November 21, 1981) is a Brazilian-born American water polo player. He is a 2008 Olympic silver medalist and a five-time Olympian (2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016). Azevedo ranks fourth on the all-time scoring list in Olympic history, with 61 goals. Nicknamed &quot;The Savior&quot; at one point, he is considered to be one of the best American water polo players in recent memory. He was the former captain of the U.S. National Men&#x27;s Water Polo Team. He is also a graduate of Stanford University.

==Early life==
Tony Azevedo was born in Rio de Janeiro, but his family moved to California when he was 1 month old. His mother is American, and his father is the Brazilian Ricardo Azevedo, a former Olympic water polo player. When he was four, Azevedo suffered a fall that severed his trachea and esophagus. Although his heart stopped beating on the operating table for a period of four minutes before doctors were able to revive him, he made a complete recovery and went on to excel in water polo, a strenuous sport.

He is 1.85 m (6 ft) and weighs 91 kg (200 lbs).

During his four years at Wilson Classical High School in Long Beach, California, his team won four California Interscholastic Federation championships and he was named MVP all four years.

==College career==
Azevedo led Stanford&#x27;s men&#x27;s water polo team to two NCAA championships (in 2001 and 2002), and he represented the United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. At the 2004 Olympics, Azevedo was second on the tournament&#x27;s goals scored list with 15. He set a school freshman scoring record (68 goals), a single-season school record as a sophomore (95, or 3.4 goals a game) and, scored a school record 332 career goals in four years at Stanford. For each of his four years in college, Azevedo was honored as the most outstanding male player of the year with the Peter J. Cutino Award – water polo&#x27;s version of the Heisman Trophy. While at Stanford, he was a member of the Alpha Pi chapter of the Kappa Alpha Order.

==Professional career==
In 2004 after graduating from Stanford University with a degree in International Relations, Azevedo signed a professional water polo contract with Bissolati Cremona (Italy) placing him among the top 10 paid players in the sport. Playing with Team Bissolati for his third season in 2006, he scored 63 goals with a 2.62 average per game. Azevedo rejoined the rest of the US men&#x27;s national team at the 2007 Melbourne World Championships. Azevedo scored 5 goals of an 8–4 win by the US National Team over host country China in the opening games of the 2008 Summer Olympics. In the championship game, the USA team won the silver medal, defeated by Hungary.

Azevedo played for VK Jug from Dubrovnik for two seasons from 2008 until 2010. Since summer 2010 he&#x27;s been playing for VK Primorac from Kotor.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Azevedo was named the captain of the United States men&#x27;s national water polo team. Near the end of the contest against Romania on July 31, 2012, he was called for a misconduct foul and was given a red card. The USA team defeated Romania 10–8.

In 2010s he played for Croatian water polo squad Jug from Dubrovnik.

===Podcast===
In 2020, he began co-hosting &quot;The Tony Azevedo Podcast&quot; with El Segundo, California stand-up comic Dave Williamson.

==Personal life==
The Azevedo family is a water polo dynasty. His father, Ricardo Azevedo, played on the Brazilian national water polo team and coached his son throughout his age group and high school career. Azevedo senior was Head Water Polo Coach both of the U.S. National Team and Long Beach State University. Tony&#x27;s sister Cassie is a two-time All-American water polo player at Long Beach State.

<text>Argentine rock (known locally as rock nacional , &quot;national rock&quot; in the sense of &quot;local&quot;, &quot;not international&quot;) is rock music composed or performed by Argentine bands or artists mostly in Spanish.

Argentine rock was the earliest incarnation of Spanish-language rock. It began by recycling hits of English-language rock &amp; roll. A rising trend of composing new songs mostly in Spanish can be traced at least back to the late 1960s, when several garage groups and aspiring musicians began composing songs and lyrics that related to local social and musical topics. Since then, Argentine rock started a continued and uninterrupted evolution through the 1970s and into the 1980s.

A distinguishing trait of Argentine rock is its insistence on Spanish language lyrics. Argentine rock today is a blanket term describing a number of rock styles and sub-cultures within Argentina.

==Related genre==
Several terms are used to describe the artistic expressions of rock and roll in Iberian America, which are often confused or given different meanings in different countries. Generally, these terms are:
*&quot;Rock en Español&quot;: includes all rock sung in Spanish.
*&quot;Latin Rock&quot;: includes all expressions of rock and roll in Latin American countries, the Caribbean, and the Latin American community of the United States. In addition to rock sung in Spanish, this includes rock sung in English, Portuguese, French, and other Latin-based languages. This generally refers to a cultural movement that began in the 80&#x27;s throughout Latin America.
*&quot;Rock Nacional&quot; in Argentina: refers to a movement of progressive music that rapidly gained popularity in 1967 with the song &quot;La Balsa&quot;.
*Argentine rock: refers to all expressions of rock performed in Argentina, regardless of language and subgenre.

== 1958−1964: Early rock and roll ==

Rock and roll first began to appear in Argentina in 1956 after the genre was created in the United States in 1954-1955, based largely on rhythm and blues and country and western. Elvis Presley and Bill Haley (who visited Argentina in 1958) awakened the interest of several Argentine artists. The most notable among Argentine garage bands which sprung up in this period was Sandro y Los de Fuego, who recorded a successful series of Spanish language covers of American rock and roll hits, and attained commercial popularity. Sandro would soon embark on his own contemporary pop standards career that would make him popular. Others include Eddie Pequenino, Los Cinco Latinos and Billy Cafaro.

==1964−1975: The classic period==
The first few years of rock music in Argentina were confined to cover bands. In 1964, Argentina, like much of the rest of the world, was shaken by The Beatles phenomenon.

Historians describe a parallel pattern of development with the United States in certain aspects of culture. Both countries were the destination for millions of Europeans, and their musical heritage were heavily influenced by Pan-European folk and traditional marches. These similar musical infusions yielded related results in both: a grass-roots rural guitar-based musical tradition, becoming Bluegrass and Country in the US, in Argentina &quot;Folklore&quot; and Pampas music. Country music is an important pillar of Rock &amp; Roll. In Argentina &quot;folklore&quot; (at that time Nueva canción was sweeping Argentina), was increasingly crossing over to popular musical trends by the late 1950s.

===Late 60s beat music===

By 1965, rock music was developing rapidly in Argentina. On television, several shows such as &quot;Ritmo y Juventud&quot; and &quot;El Club del Clan&quot;, with singers like Palito Ortega, Violeta Rivas, Chico Navarro, and Lalo Fransen, featured a poppy version of rock, which owed equal amounts to Merseybeat and to Argentine and Italian romantic pop.

Nevertheless, it was in the underground where the most influential figures of early Argentine rock would emerge. In former Jazz bars like &quot;La Cueva&quot; or &quot;La Perla del Once&quot;, figures like Moris, Pajarito Zaguri, Javier Martinez (drummer and lead singer in the Argentine blues band Manal) Miguel Abuelo, and Tanguito would gather in the mid-1960s Argentina to exchange ideas. Los Beatnicks, of which Moris and Martinez where members, began the transition that would slowly take Argentine rock from imitation to a more creative state (while still following UK trends mainly). Forming in quiet beaches of Villa Gesell, they recorded the first Spanish language single in 1966 called &quot;Rebelde&quot;.

The definitive breakthrough of Spanish-language, original material rock would be up to the band Los Gatos. After playing in &quot;La Cueva&quot; for a few months, the band released two singles in 1967. One of them, &quot;La Balsa&quot;, co-written by Tanguito and Litto Nebbia, sold 200,000 copies. This contributed to the widespread popularity of the genre because it was in Spanish and it was an original composition. The following year saw the first publication of &quot;Pinap&quot;, a rock magazine, and the founding of the first Argentine rock label, Mandioca. In 1969, four major concerts of so-called &quot;música beat&quot; (&quot;beat music&quot;) were held: the &quot;June Sunday&quot; concerts, &quot;Festival Nacional de Música Beat&quot;, &quot;Festival Pinap&quot; and &quot;Festival de Música Joven&quot;.
In the wake of Los Gatos, several bands emerged, including Luis Alberto Spinetta&#x27;s Almendra, and Manal. The three are considered the founders of the Argentine rock movement. None of these groups would have an extended history: in fact most disbanded by the early 1970s. The early Argentine rock scene was characterised by a lot of line-up changes in bands, and even member swapping between bands, or members of different bands meeting and forming new groups. The shuffles provided for a lot of experimentation and creativity.

Almendra split in 1970 and Spinetta formed Pescado Rabioso, and the remaining members started Color Humano and Aquelarre. Spinetta&#x27;s album Artaud was considered the greatest Argentine rock album of all time by the Rolling Stone Magazine. In 1970, Vox Dei refreshed the movement. Their album &quot;La Biblia&quot; (The Bible) is one of their most famous works of the early 1970s. In that same year, the first B.A (Buenos Aires) Rock festival became the first showcase of a rising subgenre that would predominate the first half of 1970s Argentine rock. A new group of musicians was to bring new ideas to the mixing bowl of early Argentine rock.

===Acoustic and heavy rock===
By the turn of the decade the first real diversification in Argentine rock start taking place, although the split had been brewing even before, as some bands began playing much heavier music, with the world of rock entering the Heavy metal era. Among them, Pescado Rabioso, Vox Dei, and Billy Bond y La Pesada del Rock and Roll. Pappo&#x27;s Blues was acknowledged as one of the greatest guitarist of all time by B.B King, who invited him to play in the Madison Square Garden. Another important but overlooked heavy rock act of the period is El Reloj, but they would drift towards progressive rock in the following years.

Conversely, the first B.A Rock festival (now promoted by Pinap magazine successor Revista Pelo), had many of the artists and bands that would lead the Acoustic rock movement: Gustavo Santaolalla forming Arco Iris, León Gieco&#x27;s folk-rock hybrid, Sui Generis and the start of Charly García&#x27;s music career, Raul Porchetto, and Pedro y Pablo, among other bands.

The proliferation of these bands and their increasing popularity, the early 1970s being the height of the hippie movement in Argentina, led to the Acusticazo of 1972. Several acoustic rock bands would gain popularity from their performances there, including Vivencia, Pastoral, and Alma y Vida. The behemothic success of the Acusticazo was a turning point in which Argentine began to be listened massively.

That same year, Tanguito was killed hit by a train. Conspiracies about his death abound, including that he committed suicide and even that he was thrown onto the tracks by police. As he was a heavy drug user, others contend he simply might have tripped. The 1993 motion picture &quot;Tango Feroz&quot; (&quot;Wild Tango&quot;) tells the life of Tanguito.

As the 1970s progressed, acoustic rock continued as the most popular style in the country.

===Sui Generis farewell concerts===

Sui Generis began shifting from their classic acoustic rock to a more electric and visceral sound. Also, stirring in the Argentine underground were new bands with a radically different sound from either acoustic or heavy rock: influenced by some of acoustic rock&#x27;s more experimental works (such as Arco Iris and their &quot;Agitor Lucens V&quot; with its world music influences), by Tango music and also by British progressive rock. This would be the blueprint of Argentine progressive rock that would bloom into the apex of the movement in 1975. As that year began few could foresee what a watershed it would become not just in Argentine rock history, but the country&#x27;s too.

Charly García and Nito Mestre decided it was time to leave Sui Generis. Their two final concerts took place at the Luna Park Arena, on September 5 of 1975, in front of 30,000 people. Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts as the end of the &#x27;Classic&#x27; Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression. Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain, among them Moris and Aquelarre.

The Classic era of Argentine rock music was completely over by 1976. As this year began, Argentine rock became far more sophisticated and conceptual. A few acoustic bands would continue having moderate success, including Pastoral, and Nito Mestre y Los Desconocidos de Siempre. But it was the beginning of the period of symphonic and progressive rock dominance.

== 1975−1983: The intermediate period ==
=== Progressive rock ===

As early as 1973, the band Contraluz combined rock with progressive and folk tinges. They would be an influential group in the years leading to the rise of symphonic and Argentine progressive rock. Its albums were acclaimed nationally and by progressive rock fans worldwide.

Another symphonic/progressive band was Crucis. Their music began attracting attention in the underground, and so they started getting bigger performing venues. As change swept Argentine rock in 1975, their music was rapidly rising to popular musical tastes. Their compositions were strong and dynamic with unexpected breaks, and the interplay between the electric guitar and keyboards captivating. The rhythm-section sounded powerful and adventurous.

Espíritu, who formed in 1973 but had roots since 1969, would go on to be an internationally followed group in the latter part of symphonic rock&#x27;s heyday. The first album &quot;Crisalida&quot; is cited as their best effort, with beautiful and alternating compositions and changing atmospheres (from mellow with acoustic guitar to up-tempo with heavy electric guitar), lush keyboards and some vocal harmonies.

Former heavy rockers El Reloj turned to prog with 1975&#x27;s self-titled album. Their sound has been compared to Uriah Heep&#x27;s mystic and proggy sound.

A symphonic band that would have a great year in 1976 was ALAS. Their music was even more intellectual and unorthodox. ALAS would feature artists such as Rodolfo Mederos and Pedro Aznar. Luis Alberto Spinetta would begin his third band Invisible later in that year. Their symphonic sound tinged with tango would bring critical praise. A band that showed a lot of promise that never materialised was Reino de Munt. Formed by Raul Porchetto, it featured a young Alejandro Lerner, and musicians like Gustavo Basterrica and Frank Ojsterseck.

Charly García formed his first post-Sui Generis band, La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros, which began Garcia&#x27;s explorations of symphonic and progressive rock. Other symphonic and progressive bands of renown would be Torax, Ave Rock, Anacrusa, and Materia Gris.

Arco Iris meanwhile continued expanding on their symphonic-folk rock and were joined by veteran Chilean band Los Jaivas, whom were escaping the Pinochet dictatorship that had come to power in their nation in 1973. The two along with Contraluz were the main exponent of the subgenre.

On March 24, 1976, the democratic government was toppled by a military coup. It opened one of the darkest political chapters in Argentina&#x27;s history, full of repression, fear, and missing citizens. Argentine rock by no means would be immune to the military crackdown, and would suffer the worst period of censorship in its history. Rock was seen as subversive by the nation&#x27;s authority figures, who began to clamp down on the music. In a 1976 speech, Admiral Emilio Massera denounced rock musicians and fans as potential subversives and repression of them began in 1977. Before the end of the decade, rock had gone increasingly underground. Rock Nacional avoided the government&#x27;s heavy media censorship and allowed an outlet for codified criticism of the government.

The music continued developing against the odds. Along with the plethora of symphonic/progressive bands, heavies Vox Dei and Pappo&#x27;s Blues continued to sustain their popularity during the period. Yet another heavy metal band, Plus, made their debut in &#x27;76 and enjoyed success through the end of the decade.

=== Symphonic rock at late 1970s ===

Argentine rock continued its symphonic, so-called &#x27;concert hall&#x27; sound through the end of the decade. The &#x27;78-&#x27;79 period was not the most prolific period for rock, as the progressive bands continued with their blueprint, and symphonic rock bands actually turned slightly commercial.

At the height of symphonic rock, Crucis was joined at the top by the popularity of Espíritu; the two are generally seen as the most well-known outfits of the symphonic rock period. The first album of La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros was a mixture of effort, individual performances, melodies, dynamic contrasts, ensemble work and arrangements.

1977 was a year of separation and endings: Crucis would disband at the end of the year. In heavy metal, Pappo&#x27;s blues would see their nearly seven-year run end. Aquelarre would return from their Spanish stint, but following a tour run went their separate ways.

But the year would show a glimpse at the future: a band from La Plata called Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, with their comical costumes and nervy fast tempos, started performing. 1977 was a year in which certain bands had a short period of fame: Soluna (Gustavo Santaolalla&#x27;s 2nd group), with their electric folk, and Orion&#x27;s Beethoven, a progressive band that played since 1969 but had their moment of fame eight years later. Neither band sustained their popularity into 1978. Bubu with their album &quot;Anabelas&quot;, in 1978 was one of those bands too.

And even more bands ceased to be. After two successful albums that featured several would-be classics of the era, La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros hung up, as did Invisible, leaving as a legacy three albums: &quot;Invisible&quot;, &quot;Durazno Sangrando&quot; and &quot;Jardin de los Presentes&quot;. Pastoral, one of the last acoustic groups still successful, split by 1978, as did ALAS. With the country gripped by World Cup mania (Argentina was host in 1978), and the disco craze, rock music suffered the worst drought since its inception. The media was openly calling out &#x27;the death&#x27; of Argentine rock.

Throughout the years, different figures and events helped Argentine rock to expand worldwide: Sandro y los del fuego in 1963; the Uruguayan Invasion of 1965 that proved the commercial viability of non-US or UK bands; the massive hit of &quot;La balsa&quot; by Los Gatos in &#x27;67 showing that Spanish language rock could be appealing to the masses; the &quot;Acusticazo&quot; of &#x27;72. In the drought days of 1978, Serú Girán emerged as a &#x27;supergroup&#x27;.

=== Serú Girán ===

In 1977 Charly García got together with his friend David Lebón, an ex member of Luis Alberto Spinetta&#x27;s band Pescado Rabioso, to write songs in Brazil. There, Charly re-encountered Oscar Moro, the drummer of his former band &quot;La Máquina De Hacer Pájaros&quot; and they decided to invite him to help compose new material. The trio soon decided that instead of selling their songs like they had originally planned, they would play them themselves in a new band. Now all they needed was a bass player. Pedro Aznar was a lesser known bassist who had once been a member of progressive rock group &quot;ALAS&quot;. He also happened to be a friend of Moro&#x27;s, who knew of Aznar&#x27;s ability with the funk and jazz bass. Moro brought Aznar into the group and they began to prepare themselves.

Charly, Moro, Lebón, and Aznar created a sound that was distinctive from anything in English-language rock. Their rock style caught the attention of both the lower and upper classes. Serú Girán could be &#x27;brainy&#x27; yet unpretentious rockers simultaneously.

Partly because the group lived for three months in northeast Brazil, the band&#x27;s first album shows clear influences of Brazilian music, mixed with symphonic rock and jazz. But the band&#x27;s first live concert to support the album created one of the strangest anecdotes in Argentine rock: the fans did not understand the strange costumes the band used (entirely in white except for Garcia with a black jacket and shoes); and then when they played the song &quot;Disco Shock&quot;, a satire poking fun at disco music (which was at its height in 1978), people thought they were really serious. Whistles and boos would follow and what should have been a great concert turned into a fiasco, with fans clamoring for Sui Generis songs. Serú Girán did not get their point across their ideas as expected. It would all fuel wild speculations about the members&#x27; sexual orientations, a PR nightmare at the time.

But the group bounced back with a vengeance with their 2nd album &quot;La Grasa de las Capitales&quot;. It was well received by the specialist press, and would cement their status as the most popular band of their time. Serú Girán&#x27;s third album &quot;Bicicleta&quot; (1980) was tepidly received at first, but in time would be considered the band&#x27;s best work. Both albums departed from the symphonic rock of the first LP, the music turning more visceral and &#x27;simple&#x27; with less arrangement and pomp. Serú Girán would not be isolated in this trend, as slowly Argentine rock was writing the final chapters in its symphonic and progressive period.

=== Argentine rock and the Islas Malvinas War ===

The nation was still in the grip of a dictatorship as the 1980s dawned, even as repression had eased somewhat by then. The start of the decade continued to feature Serú Girán, now with their less pretentious sound, at the top of the charts. Vox Dei entered their 3rd decade in rock, a virtual first for any local band, and León Gieco&#x27;s popularity as a solo artist was on the rise.

One of the last progressive bands would be Tantor. They were less symphonic and far more prog-experimental, with jazz as a major support. Their first eponymous album was a hit in the scene, and the band would continue till the mid-1980s as one of the last bands of the progressive era.

Serú Girán went touring in Brazil in 1980, where their reception by fans at the Monterrey Jazz Festival in Rio de Janeiro was so enjoyed that the organizers requested that they perform again, the next day, but on the main stage with jazz-rockers Weather Report. There, Pedro Aznar met Pat Metheny, to whom he gave some cassettes with his own works. Serú Girán returned home, released &quot;Bicicleta&quot; and gathered 60,000 fans in La Rural back in Buenos Aires chanting &quot;no se banca más&quot; (&quot;it isn&#x27;t bearable anymore&quot;, alluding to the dictatorship). That year they had also performed in concert with Spinetta Jade, Luis Alberto Spinetta&#x27;s latest project and the other popular rock group of the early 1980s. It was an event in which both bands eventually played some songs of each other&#x27;s repertoire.

Spinetta Jade was a blend of jazz and rock that escaped the trappings of symphonic rock, something that was unheard in Argentina at that time. Towards the last two albums, the sound became a little bit more &quot;pop&quot;, and embedded with electronic elements (samplers and synthesizers with &quot;artificial&quot; textures).

Serú Girán released their fourth album &quot;Peperina&quot; in 1981 and promoted it on tour, but by the end of the year Pedro Aznar decided to leave the band because he wanted to study at Berklee. (When he was there, by the end of 1982, he was called to join the Pat Metheny Group). Serú Girán (which at the time was even planning tours in Europe), had a strong sendoff on March 6–7, 1982, when they performed for the last time at the Arena Obras Sanitarias. They performed the song &quot;No llores por mí, Argentina&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for me, Argentina&quot;, which has no relation to the &quot;Evita&quot; musical theme), which was full of symbolism. It was not only a farewell for Aznar, and for Serú Girán, but for an era in Argentine music, and history. The timing was beyond befitting.

Argentina&#x27;s economy was in full recession in 1982, and discontent with the military government was rampant. On April 2, the world would awake yet again in the 20th century to the horror of war. After a season of death and destruction in the South Atlantic in which both sides suffered sunken ships, aircraft blown from the sky, and hundreds of young lives were cut short, the United Kingdom regained control over the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas). The popularity of the Argentine military government hit then bottom, and democratic elections were called shortly after.

== 1983−1990: Argentine rock goes global ==

=== New Democracy Sound ===

The war would be a dark chapter in Argentine history, but would have the paradoxical effect of creating one of the most fortuitous circumstances in the history of any rock genre.

In May of &#x27;82 the &quot;Festival for Latin American Solidarity&quot; brought together all the great bands of Argentine rock. It was a festival in support of the troops overseas, and also a veiled protest to war, and a call for peace (at first the musicians feared appearing for risk of being portrayed pro-war). This event was the final stepping stone of Argentine rock in becoming &quot;the&quot; dominant form of music in the country. At the same time, English-language rock was wiped out from radio play. The programmers had to fill the voids with something, and that was with Argentine rock. This created the opportunity of exposure to countless underground bands. It would set the foundations for the explosion of rock in the mid-1980s.

In the latter days of symphonic rock, a great number of new groups started popping
seemingly out of nowhere. In reality, these were bands influenced by post-punk, new wave from the US and Britain, and by the more symphonic and less progressive side of Argentine rock. Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, who had started in 1977, were growing a larger following on a monthly basis. In 1979 in La Plata, Federico Moura would form a pioneering new wave band called Virus. In Buenos Aires, three young men influenced by the advent of post-punk in Britain started exchanging ideas, and decided to form a band with the name Soda Stereo.

In 1980 friends who were enthralled by the wave of US and UK punk formed the band Los Violadores. Miguel Abuelo, a founding figure of Argentine rock in the 1960s, would return after a decade in Europe and form Los Abuelos de la Nada, which happened to feature a young man by the name of Andres Calamaro. Someone named Miguel Mateos, after talking to Freddie Mercury, won the opportunity to open for Queen in Buenos Aires with his new band ZAS. At the local pubs in Mendoza a pop-rock act called Los Enanitos Verdes appeared. An Italian of Scottish background named Luca Prodan arrived in Argentina to fight his heroin addiction, worsened by the death of his friend Ian Curtis of Joy Division. Prodan would form Sumo. This band, one of the least conventional in Argentina at the time, and since, has been voted Best Argentine Band by a poll composed by rock journalists in 2009. Despite its &#x27;underground&#x27; status, it has fervent followers in Chile, Uruguay, Mexico and a plethora of countries worldwide.

From the &quot;Festival of Latin American Solidarity&quot; emerged solo artists that would go on to delve into a more adult oriented form of rock and pop music, with the Argentine youngsters of the 1960s now mature adults. Some of these names were Juan Carlos Baglietto (who was optimistic about a young musician from Rosario named Fito Páez), Alejandro Lerner, and Celeste Carballo. In heavy metal, Pappo founded his new band Riff, and newcomers V8 and La Torre would emerge. New witty rock bands like Los Twist, Suéter, and the riot grrrl group Viuda e hijas de Roque Enroll crashed to the scene infusing Argentine rock with needed dosages of humor and self-deprecation. On the gothic side of rock, La Sobrecarga and Euroshima would carry the torch.

And for the first time in Argentine rock history there was a &quot;revival&quot; of an earlier style, with Acoustic rock making a comeback on the back of reunions by Almendra and Manal. On the other hand, Charly García and Luis Alberto Spinetta embarked on their solo careers. Moris returned from his period in Spain.

Meanwhile, Argentina entered a new era with the inauguration of Raúl Alfonsín as president of a fully democratic nation. Rock bands would no longer be harassed and even censored by the powers-that-be, and freedom of expression flowered. Songs critical of the military that were in prior years censored, some with exquisite lyrical poetry and allegory, were released during this time: &quot;Tiempos Dificiles&quot; by Fito Páez (sung by Juan Carlos Baglietto), &quot;Maribel se Durmió&quot; by Luis Alberto Spinetta, &quot;Sólo le pido a Dios&quot; by León Gieco and &quot;Los dinosaurios&quot; by Charly García. A more direct criticism of the military government that ended in 1983 came from the Argentine punk groups like Los Violadores (singing songs like &quot;Represión&quot;) or seminal heavy metal bands like V8.

Finally, segments of Argentine rock moved away from the concert hall and &#x27;solemn&#x27; era, full of very heavy lyrics and concerns with domestic issues. It started to lighten up and turn more irreverent, and to focus on mundane concerns such as money, love, and sports. This would make the music and lyrics far more accessible (and commercial) to international audiences.

The stage was set for the boom of Argentine rock in Latin America and beyond.

=== Argentine Invasion ===

The &quot;Cafe Einstein&quot; was opened in 1982 by Omar Chaban (who would end up convicted for the República Cromañón nightclub fire 22 years later), featuring some of the first presentations of three underground bands: Sumo, Soda Stereo, and Los Twist. Both Sumo and Soda Stereo featured slightly different line-ups in their early days, with Sumo having an English girl, Stephanie Nuttal, on drums. She returned to England when war broke out between her country and Argentina. Also in &#x27;82 Charly García released his full-album solo debut, the acclaimed &quot;Yendo de la Cama al Living&quot;.

&quot;One could feel the winds of change&quot; in 1983 Argentina. A cliché perhaps, but at no time more appropriately used. Everything was optimism about the future, the country, and music. Even technology cooperated with the palpable change: it was the year the compact disc was introduced. And 1984 was the year of female rock: Patricia Sosa and her heavy rock band La Torre were voted best band of the year and &quot;Solo quiero Rock and Roll&quot; best single, a first for a female lead rock act. Another female-fronted band, Los Twist, and their superbly catchy tunes about nothing were also doing very well, but the group suffered a blow when Fabiana Cantilo left.

As the early 1980s progressed it became clear that the new generation of rockers were not like anything before: Los Violadores pioneering punk in Latin America; Virus oxygenating rock with their new-wave sound, followed by Cosméticos with a similar style; Sumo&#x27;s punkish reggae-rock developing a fanatical cult following (Luca Prodan sung mostly in English, which reduced his band&#x27;s radio exposure yet their fame expanded unabated); and Soda Stereo the buzz of the underground. ZAS introduced the phrase &quot;rock en tu idioma&quot; (&quot;rock in your language&quot;). Los Abuelos de la Nada and newcomers G.I.T. found quick success outside Argentina, a preview of things to come.

By 1985, year in which Los Fabulosos Cadillacs were formed, several bands began receiving consistent airplay across Latin America. Argentine rock began &quot;climbing&quot; the continent up the Andes: first Chile, then Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela. Zeta Bosio member of Soda Stereo said regarding this: &quot;We would leave Argentina and tour in Chile, Peru, etc, and in some places they had never heard a live rock concert before... they said that such music was for another world and wouldn’t work... now it&#x27;s all joy seeing how it did work and that it now has its own legs...&quot; Argentine rock bands were the first to be signed to multinational record labels for distribution across many nations.

The trickle became a flood as 1986 approached, and by the start of that year it had become a continental phenomenon, reaching Central America, Mexico, and crossing the Atlantic to Spain, even as far Italy, France, and Germany. Los Enanitos Verdes, with their energetic pop-rock that appealed through music lines, gained previously unseen popularity across borders. The Cadillacs, with their ska-rock with a heavy Latin infusion, turned into instant rock stars across Latin America and, eventually, worldwide. Rata Blanca, a heavy metal band formed in 1987 from the ashes of influential early 1980s rockers called V8, also conquered the Spanish-speaking world. The same did Charly García, Fito Páez, and now solo artist Miguel Mateos. 1986 was the climax of an unprecedented wave of international success for Argentine rock.

It would help to revitalize rock movements in other Latin American countries for two reasons: 1) It would create a buzz and excitement in the local rock scenes; 2) it proved to producers and record labels in those countries that &quot;Rock en Español&quot; could work and make them money. In Mexico, Argentine bands were being marketed by media giants like Televisa as &quot;rock in your language&quot;. Its success changed the landscape of the Mexican scene: it laid the groundwork for Mexican rock in Spanish to itself expand overseas. In Peru, the Argentine invasion was a catalyst that brought that country&#x27;s own movement more to the mainstream. In Chile, where a few outstanding bands existed even prior to the Argentine boom (see Los Prisioneros), the flood of rock music coming from their eastern neighbor would fully energize and inspire the local scene, and Argentine rock&#x27;s influence continues to this day. The current boom in Colombian rock can be traced to the 1980s, with most Colombian rock acts citing the Argentine invasion groups as a direct influence. In countries like Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia, the effects were even more profound.

As 1988 began, with the most important Argentine bands (Soda Stereo, Los Fabulosos Cadillacs, Los Enanitos Verdes, Rata Blanca, Charly García, Andres Calamaro, Miguel Mateos, Sumo, Virus) on constant tour of Latin America, Europe, and even countries in Asia, the globalization of Argentine rock and pop was complete. By this time the invasion had begun to &#x27;quiet&#x27; down in comparison to the prior three years, but its legacy of opening the doors of Argentine rock to massive success beyond its own borders remains to this day.

=== Soda Stereo ===

Soda Stereo was one of the most successful and influential rock band in Spanish ever. The influence of Soda Stereo and its music, style, and even &#x27;business acumen&#x27; is undeniable. They were also the first Spanish-language band to use all aspects of their popularity to the fullest: their music videos, aesthetic, philosophy, and more. In the beginning they were deeply influenced by new wave and bands such as The Police, Television, and Talking Heads, and by symphonic rockers Luis Alberto Spinetta and Aquelarre.

With their first album, the self-titled &quot;Soda Stereo&quot; (1984), they reached national success with joyful and ironic lyrics, and a sound that combined pop, reggae, ska, and new wave, but were accused of being superficial and frivolous. The second album, &quot;Nada Personal&quot;, strengthened the popularity of the band, with instant classics such as &quot;Nada Personal&quot; and &quot;Cuando Pase el Temblor&quot; opening the doors of the Latin American market; 1986&#x27;s &quot;Signos&quot; would heavily increase their popularity and in 1988 they came up with what could arguably be called their masterpiece, their album &quot;Doble Vida&quot;. The musical arrangements and the lyrics reached a subtlety never heard before from the band&#x27;s production, the most notable example being the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;En La Ciudad De La Furia&quot;, a cryptically metaphorical ode to the band&#x27;s hometown of Buenos Aires and the city&#x27;s inhabitants. They embarked in an extensive tour through Latin America that brought the live album &quot;Ruido Blanco&quot;.

With the tour supporting &quot;Signos&quot;, Soda Stereo became international superstars. The band would continue their worldwide success well into the 1990s, and evolving their musical sounds unlike almost any other Rock en Español band. In fact, they would lead the way in the changes Argentine rock would experience as the 1990s drew near.

=== Late &#x27;80s: Loss and Experimentation ===

The year 1987 ended in tragedy for Argentine rock. Luca Prodan had finally lost his personal battle with alcohol and was found dead on December 22, due to complications from his addiction. His death was a shock to the entire music industry and to millions of heartbroken fans. Following Prodan&#x27;s death, the members of Sumo split, founding two new rock outfits: Divididos and Las Pelotas; both bands became major players of 1990s rock.

Miguel Abuelo, following gallbladder surgery, was diagnosed with AIDS; terminally ill, he died from cardiac arrest on March 26, 1988. Virus leader Federico Moura&#x27;s persistent pneumonia fueled rumors of further complications, which ended in the revelation soon after by the singer that he was infected with AIDS. Moura died on December 21, 1988. Moura&#x27;s passing completed a dreadful trifecta of musicians who had still much to offer. It was a tough blow for rock. As a group, Virus survived and soldiered on into the 1990s as a more adult pop-rock outfit than the outrageous yet influential 1980s band that helped define the sound of &quot;techno-pop&quot;.

Three major trends defined the Argentine rock of the end of the 1980s. The first trend was the consolidation of the Argentine Invasion bands into somewhat more mature rock groups. Some began to experiment with world music in the last two years of the 1980s. For example, Charly García got together with his old Serú Girán partner Pedro Aznar and recorded &quot;Tango&quot;, whose name accurately suggests the style of the album. Before Federico Moura&#x27;s death, Virus had also begun turning to Brazilian music for their album &quot;Superficies de Placer&quot;. In general the mood of the music got darker echoing a deteriorated economic climate.

A second was the rise of &quot;Tropical&quot; rock, and the explosion of local Reggae bands in Argentina seemingly out of nowhere in 1987. While Argentine rock was triumphant internationally, Argentina was caught in a reggae-mania: in the summer of that year arose Los Pericos, Los Cafres, La Zimbabwe, and Jafran, among many other smaller outfits. But it was a fad, and only Los Pericos would sustain and grow their careers once the fancy faded (Los Cafres would be mildly successful starting in 1994).
A band that was not a fad was Los Auténticos Decadentes, who would become a hugely popular ska-Latin pop and ballad group. They along with Los Pericos and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs would be leaders in the tropical rock scene of ska, reggae and Latin music.

The third trend came about partly as a result of the first: many rock fans did not approve of the commercialism and experimentation of the A-bands, and increasingly looked underground for a more confrontational guitar-led rock. Among them: Todos Tus Muertos, Don Cornelio y La Zona (later Los Visitantes), Los Brujos, Babasónicos, Los Siete Delfines, Massacre Palestina. All of them would be part of the&quot; &quot;Nuevo Rock&quot;&quot; (&quot;New Rock&quot;) explosion of the early 1990s.

In heavy metal, the already mentioned Rata Blanca dominated popular tastes, specially in other Latin American countries, along with Hermética, JAF, and Horcas (the last two more domestic), in a very healthy scene for a style that never was overwhelmingly crowded in Argentine rock. An important band in the metal underground was Nepal, one of the pioneering bands of thrash metal. Formed in 1984, they were part of the first generation of worldwide thrashers, and gained prominence as the decade ended and musical tastes turned approbatory for more extreme metal. The genre got many magazines committed solely to it and distributed nationwide: Madhouse, Metal, Riff Raff, Revista Epopeya, etc.

The end of the 1980s were also a period of continued growth for Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, on their way to becoming one of the most mythic cult bands of broad popularity in the history of rock, anywhere. It was also the time when Los Ratones Paranoicos were gaining followers with the burgeoning &quot;rolingas&quot; (followers of a subgenre of Argentine rock that is greatly indebted to the Rolling Stones). On the pop side Man Ray with their tailor-made FM songs were ubiquitous. Finally, Divididos and their guitar-crunching melodic noise was more and more becoming a preview of what the next decade would bring. In general, as the fantastic 1980s for Argentine rock closed, the music was in period of transition and exploration at all levels.

== 1990−1998: Modern Argentine Rock ==

=== &quot;Canción Animal&quot; and New Rock ===

Soda Stereo&#x27;s frontman Gustavo Cerati could foresee the musical trends, putting his own band in front of it. After releasing the increasingly hard rocking &quot;Doble Vida&quot;, the band headed to studio with new producer Daniel Melero to record their fifth album, &quot;Canción Animal&quot;. It was released in October 1990, about a year before Nirvana released &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

&quot;Canción Animal&quot; confirmed that it was OK to return Argentine rock to an &quot;in your face&quot;, edgy attitude that shaped the Argentine Invasion aesthetic in the early years of the 1980s, but this time with electric guitars as the stars. From that album, the single &quot;De Música Ligera&quot;, might well be the most recognizable Spanish-language rock single of all time, and also one of the most covered by bands all over Latin America and elsewhere. &quot;Canción Animal&quot; helped underground acts like Los Brujos, Peligrosos Gorriones, and Massacre break faster into the mainstream, by taking guitar-crunching rock to the apex as 1991 began. Even pop-bound groups like Los Enanitos Verdes rocked harder in their early 1990s works, particularly in their &quot;Big Bang&quot; album, whose single &quot;Lamento Boliviano&quot; is now a classic.

These and other bands in their wake would be dubbed the &quot;Nuevo Rock Argentino&quot;, or New Argentine Rock. A term that not long after would also be used as an umbrella to group bands with a hard-to-pin-down style, like the neo-surf pop of Super Ratones (from Mar del Plata), and neo-fusionists La Portuaria with their world music touches. &quot;Nuevo Rock&quot; would be the dominant form of rock in Argentina until the middle of the decade when it lost ground to so-called &quot;rock suburbano&quot;.

In 1992, Soda Stereo presented &quot;Dynamo&quot;, their sixth album, arguably the most conceptual (the other being &quot;Signos&quot;), and the most experimental to that point. It apparently took fans by surprise, and was the lowest seller of the group&#x27;s works (it did not help that in the middle of all this the band changed labels; Sony would not promote a band that was leaving, and BMG wouldn&#x27;t promote another label&#x27;s album).

On the other hand, Babasónicos had in 1992 their first major breakthrough of their careers with the hit &quot;D-generación&quot; from their 1992 album Pasto, which would herald future international success for a band that would define the sound of &quot;sonic&quot; rock. Juana La Loca was another band in the so-called sonic scene that started in the early 1990s and would breakthrough a few years later. The band that founded the Sonic Movement in Buenos Aires was Iguana Lovers, started in 1990. Now with collaborations of the shoegaze British indie Ride members, Mark Gardener and Loz Colbert, they were positioned as the most important new band of the Buenos Aires indie scene in 1991. Los Brujos would have a great year 1992; the single &quot;Kanishka&quot; was an instant chart-topper. Los Visitantes equalled the success of Los Brujos the next year with their album &quot;Salud Universal&quot;, an offbeat mix of guitar rock and tango tinges. Todos Tus Muertos was a punk response to the Argentine rock being made in the late 1980s, consciously choosing to be far more direct and explicit in their musical (and political) statements. The band gained rapid acclaim with the rise of New Rock, and were one of the favorite bands of the period. Slowly the group would evolve from their early punk to a more diverse style that include afro-Latin rhythms.

The odd-group out that appeared in the early 1990s was the outrageously named Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas (a reference to Colombian footballer Carlos Valderrama). More rappers than rockers, the group nonetheless made a mark in the rock scene as time progressed and they were able to more successfully integrate rap with Argentine rock, and also Latin rhythms. One of the members, Dante, is the son of Luis Alberto Spinetta.

=== Rock rolinga ===

As New Rock was dominant, some acts in the distant suburbs of Buenos Aires where playing straightforward and guitar centered rock music, with a foundation in the blues, and an unsophisticated image (somewhat a counter-movement to the image conscious, musically more pretentious New Rock).

Some of these suburban acts owed so much to the sound of the Rolling Stones, that their followers came to be known as &quot;rolingas&quot;. Eventually the rock rolinga (a.k.a. rock stone) became a style: cheesy 1970s sneakers, tight T-shirts with the logo of the Stones or a local &#x27;stone&#x27; band, and a disdain for other Argentine rock subgenres they consider part of the establishment. At the forefront of this movement were Los Ratones Paranoicos, whom for years before were perfecting a musical formula that would be emulated by countless neighborhood bands in years to come. They were joined in the Rolinga scene by Viejas Locas in the mid 1990s.

The incessant touring of the rolinga bands around the suburbs of Buenos Aires and other cities would reap benefits not only for themselves but for other suburban groups that would follow soon after. Thus, Rolinga rock arguably became the most popular music genre in Argentina in the 1990s.

===1990s Metal===
The last decade of the twentieth century was a very productive one for this style of rock in Argentina. There had always been &quot;heavy&quot; bands: Billy Bond y La Pesada del Rock and Roll in the 1960s, Pescado Rabioso and Pappo&#x27;s Blues in the 1970s, V8, Riff (Argentine band), and several underground metal acts in the 1980s. But they had never been at the forefront of Argentine rock, seemingly always obscured by other genres whether it was acoustic, symphonic, progressive, or the 1980s invasion bands. This changed in the 1990s.

As the decade started Rata Blanca, Horcas, Hermética and J.A.F had very respectable careers. Rata Blanca was internationally approved: in fact, it is plausible to state that their classic metal sound was more popular outside Argentina than within. Internationally popular to a lesser extent was Hermética, the arch-rivals of Rata Blanca (both formed in 1987 when V8 disbanded), but there were no doubts of their massive following at home. Horcas and J.A.F stayed mostly successful in the local medium, though nonetheless had some overseas exposure.

The major development in Argentine metal of the 1990s was the rise of A.N.I.M.A.L. The acronym translated literally stands for &quot;Abused (accosted), Our Indians Died While Fighting&quot;. And their themes lived up to that title: the band would be one of the most outspoken advocates for indigenous people and even nationalism, while also (as such bands tend to do), blasting against the current world order. Their sound is equal parts hardcore, heavy metal, and thrash. Another important band formed in 1990 was Tren Loco, whom long after went to Japan and won second place in a major battle-of-the-band event at famous Budokan Stadium in Tokyo. The metal underground also flourished in the 1990s, with bands like Alakrán, Jezabel, Jason, Logos, and Jeriko, among others.

===Other developments===

Solo artists from the earlier generations were by the 1990s established figures in the medium. Some stars were Charly García and Luis Alberto Spinetta. Garcia enjoyed a prolific 1980s with many of his albums turning into classics. Spinetta had a more uneven body of work but nonetheless was successful. Pappo continued putting out blues and heavy rock records, Miguel Mateos remained a popular rock figure in Latin America even as he dropped almost off the radar in Argentina. León Gieco&#x27;s unique &quot;folk-rock meets world music&quot; approaches made him an internationally acclaimed musician.

Fito Páez&#x27;s pop career continued to take-off in the early 1990s. In 1992 he released &quot;El Amor después del Amor&quot;, becoming the best selling Argentine rock album. The title &quot;love after love&quot; was not by chance: he had just ended a well-publicized relationship with female rocker Fabiana Cantilo (herself an important 1990s singer in the movement), and was getting involved with movie actress Cecilia Roth. With the album Paez was confirmed an international pop star. Meanwhile, Andrés Calamaro had enjoyed some popularity since his solo career begun, but never managed a complete breakthrough with the public. He left for Spain, and there met two local musicians forming Los Rodriguez in 1991. Two years later the hit single &quot;Sin Documentos&quot; finally gave Calamaro an international hit, and the band gained overnight vogue in Spain and Latin America.

Tropical, Fusion, and Latin influenced rock continued its ascent. 1992 was the year of &quot;La Pachanga&quot;: Rosario&#x27;s Vilma Palma e Vampiros single was an across the board mega hit in the Spanish-speaking world; there was no way of escaping it unless one did not have any kind of social life in the early 1990s.
Bands like Los Auténticos Decadentes, who had a major hit in 1990 with &quot;Loco (tu forma de ser)&quot;, and Los Pericos mirrored the tendency of increased popularity for the subgenre. Los Fabulosos Cadillacs had a slump in the early 1990s after harvesting great accolades in the late 1980s, but came back with a roar in 1994 with &quot;Vasos Vacios&quot;; the compilation that featured &quot;Matador&quot;. The single would turn into a global superhit, winning MTV&#x27;s best video of the year. The early 1990s were also the formative years of a group that would have an impact towards the new millennium: Bersuit Vergarabat. La Mosca would begin tapping into the tropical and Latin trend by 1995.

Argentine punk-revival took off in the 1990s. Los Violadores had ruled 1980s punk; them along with the foreign punk bands of yesteryear would inspire the members of Attaque 77 and Flema. Formed in 1986 and 1987 respectively, they were pioneers of the worldwide punk revival movement. Attaque 77&#x27;s breakthrough came in 1990 with the single &quot;Hacelo por Mi&quot;; Flema never broke to the mainstream but were heroic figures of the punk underground. Both groups paved the way for dozens of followers. One of those were 2 Minutos, with their pure-energy, extreme, back-to-basics punk rock. Another darling of the scene were Todos Tus Muertos, perhaps one of few bands in any punk movement that was accepted for their various rock styles &quot;besides&quot; punk. Fun People took punk&#x27;s liberal philosophy to another level by tackling the punk-scene itself: many of their lyrics criticized the macho attitudes in the movement which they saw contradictory to the spirit of punk. They were also the first band that sang in Spanglish, meanwhile another bands, like Drop Dead! Argentina used to do it only in English. The She Devils were the leaders of the local queercore scene. Cienfuegos, a punk band that had existed since the 1980s but suffered various contingencies, finally would produce albums by the mid 1990s.

&quot;See:&quot; Argentine punk

In the Argentine northwest, important punk and indie scenes developed in the mid-to-late nineties. Bands like 448, Volstead, Estacion Experimental and Los Chicles led the scenes.

=== The Mid &#x27;90s Schism ===

In the middle years of the 1990s a rift developed in Argentine rock that would, with only slight wrinkles, endure to present times.

By 1995 &quot;nuevo rock argentino&quot; or Argentine new rock had lost steam. For starters, bands like Los Siete Delfines and Peligrosos Gorriones, with their more artistic antics, fell out of favor. At the same time, groups like Massacre and La Portuaria went on recording hiatuses and would not return until more favorable winds in the early to mid-2000s. Los Brujos disbanded in 1998 after eight years of solid productions, but it left a large void in the movement. One of the last &quot;hurrahs&quot; of new rock were rap-rockers Actitud Maria Marta, which had a year of fame in 1995. Babasónicos, Todos Tus Muertos, and Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas were some of the new rock bands that were able to maintain their level as the year 2000 approached.

Also, 1995 would see the last album by Soda Stereo, their relaxed almost chillout-like &quot;Sueño Stereo&quot;, an album at times more electronic than rock previewing the direction of Gustavo Cerati&#x27;s solo career. Soda Stereo would go on a last grand tour through the United States and Latin America, selling out entire stadiums as they went. Their last concert in Buenos Aires in 1997 was released as a double-album, with 70,000 people selling out twice at the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti. The arguably greatest band in Argentine and Rock en Español history wrapped up the concert and their career with the live version of &quot;&quot;De Musica Ligera&quot;;&quot;, Gustavo Cerati, the vocalist, guitarist and leader of the band, would end the song thanking his public, and would finish this gratitude by saying &quot;... Gracias totales&quot; (total thanks), this would become an iconic phrase for the band and Argentine rock thereafter.

Conversely, &quot;rolinga&quot; rock was on the up. On the one hand were the 1980s bands that by the mid 1990s approached the suburban rock sound: Redonditos de Ricota, Divididos, Las Pelotas. They were joined by two bands that would define suburban in the late 1990s as well: Los Piojos and La Renga. La Renga is also considered one of the &quot;Rolinga&quot; groups (followers of the Rolling Stones blueprint) like Los Ratones Paranoicos and Viejas Locas, whose weighty followings would only grow larger.

Argentine youth began to musically and socially gravitate to either the suburban rock groups or towards the underground. And even within these two major groupings there were subdivisions (&quot;rolinga&quot; and &quot;post-chabón&quot; in suburban rock; &quot;sonico, punk, dark&quot; in the underground). Then there were the heavy metal followers, the large and expanding indie scene, and the tropical rock followers, genre increasingly intermixed with the fledgling Cumbia which would explode in the new millennium. The pieces were in place for the current period of rock in Argentina.
On a completely different, and original level, Andrea Prodan (Luca Prodan&#x27;s brother) emerged with a bizarre and unique all-vocal, solo album called &quot;Viva Voce&quot;, recorded on independent label Silly Records. The record won an A.C.E. award and was among Peter Gabriel&#x27;s favourite records in his Real World list of 1996.

== 1998− : The Contemporary Period ==

=== Late 1990s &amp; 21st century ===

The late 1990s charts were dominated by the success of bands like Los Piojos, La Renga, Divididos, Redonditos de Ricota, Las Pelotas, Los Ratones Paranoicos, La Mancha de Rolando, Karamelo Santo, Caballeros de la Quema, and many more suburban rock bands. They were joined by Uruguayans No Te Va Gustar and La Vela Puerca, giving rise to the term &quot;rioplatense&quot; rock (rock from the Río de la Plata region) to label all of the similarly inclined outfits. Rolinga rock has created many fine singles and albums, but critics argue many of the bands (specially second rate groups in the &quot;rolinga&quot; scene), simply repeated the same formula to sell albums. Another feature of rolinga rock is that it tends to shun overseas success: whether this is a conscious attitude or a simple limitation of the genre is an ongoing debate.

On the other hand, the likes of Divididos, Los Piojos, and Redonditos have transcended its constraints and become influential in Argentine rock and popular on an international level. The better bands in the genre also feature an unusual versatility with non-rock styles like tango, folk, African music, Latin, jazz, and even North American country music, each with their own eclectic mixture. It would help elevate them from the legions of imitators in the crowded suburban scene. Divididos 6th album &quot;Narigon Del Siglo&quot; (2000) was one of the first great Argentine rock albums of the new decade; it was peppered with folk.

The underground was more under than usual in the late 1990s, it was nonetheless extremely creative. A style that gained some mainstream exposure was &quot;rock sónico&quot; (&quot;sonic&quot; rock), influenced by the 1980s &quot;techno-pop&quot; of Virus and early Soda Stereo (and also Britpop), through Babasónicos and Juana La Loca. The latter group found success with sonic rock in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Vida Modelo&quot;. The former would increase their popularity with each new album, arriving at 2001&#x27;s &quot;Jessico&quot;, which received international acclaim as one of the first truly outstanding albums of the new millennium. Other underground groups started making noise at this time: Iguana Lovers, they founded the Sonic movement in Buenos Aires in 1990, El Otro Yo, Catupecu Machu, and Santos Inocentes, leaders-to-be of the early 2000s alternative rock scene in Argentina. Super Ratones&#x27;s returned to the alternative charts with 2001&#x27;s Grammy nominee &quot;Mancha Registrada&quot;.

In heavy metal, Hermética disbanded by 1995 giving rise to Almafuerte. With a more up-to-date sound, they were one of the late 1990s favorites along with A.N.I.M.A.L. Rata Blanca continued to perform and record intermittently touring countries around Latin America. Classic metalists O&#x27;Connor in the underground would emerge by the early 2000s, along with exponents of nu metal Cabezones and Carajo. One of the most critically acclaimed bands of present is Los Natas. Originally a stoner rock group, in subsequent albums the band has turned more experimental. Some have called this demiurgic style (infused with Argentine folk, psychedelia, and space rock)&quot; &quot;Patagonian doom&quot;&quot;, and this brand of metal has been ranked with the best heard in the new millennium. The band itself prefers to call it &quot;free&quot; rock.

In punk, Attaque 77 were still going strong, as did Fun People (including a European tour), until their disbanding in 2000. The punk underground of the late 1990s was buzzing with new bands (Cadena Perpetua, Expulsados), many of them to guide the early 2000s melodic punk scene (Smitten (band), Shaila).

In tropical or fusion rock, Bersuit Vergarabat rose to the zenith of the genre. &quot;Libertinaje&quot; (1998) catapulted the band to the top, and to tours of the Americas and Europe. The follow-up &quot;Hijos del Culo&quot; (2000) also went double-platinum. Both albums display a dizzying range in style versatility. From the side of reggae-rock Los Pericos and Los Cafres dominated. Ska had Los Calzones and Kapanga, but by 2000 Los Fabulosos Cadillacs had called it quits to their internationally renowned career of rock with ska, rap, reggae, and Latin. La Mosca and Dancing Mood reached achieved greater popularity. Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas produced some catchy, original, and danceable music (a mix of rock, hip-hop, and Latin) which cemented their fan base all over the Americas, until the duo&#x27;s separation in 2001.

A highly talented and promising band was Karamelo Santo, another contribution of the city of Mendoza (also home of Los Enanitos Verdes). They featured a very refreshing mix of rock, punk, ska, afro-Uruguayan, and cumbia rhythms that earned them critical praise in Argentina. They would spend most of the 2001–2004 period on extensive tours of Europe and the Americas. Todos Tus Muertos would break up at the height of their popularity in 1999.

To a lesser extent dance and electronica music, which in Argentina have the largest scenes in Latin America, also influenced Argentine rock of the 2000s. A good example of this is the internationally prominent techno-pop act Miranda!, a band that owes as much to current dance and electronica as the 1980s techno-pop of Virus and Los Encargados, electronic pioneers in Argentina.

=== Nowadays ===

Argentine rock, in the middle of the 2000s, can be said to showcase the following trends:
* A continued commercial success of rolinga and suburban rock. In the early part of the current decade the so-called &#x27;2nd wave of suburban&#x27; crashed to the scene: Guasones, Jovenes Pordioseros, La 25, Cielo Razzo, Black Roses, Hijos Del Oeste, El Bordo, Callejeros and Casi Justicia Social. Their fan base is somewhat younger than those of the 1st wave, and their music is derivative of the 1st but with a slightly pop, more teen oriented approach.
* Influenced by bands like Genesis, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Rush and Dream Theater the underground progressive rock and progressive metal scene has been constantly growing since 2005, with many trends like: metal - influenced bands like Fughu, Dudosa Moral and Destino 101, progressive - pop - metal like De Rien, jazz fusion - progressive rock outfit Fantasía Cromática, progressive - folk Isósceles, King Crimson - Frank Zappa influenced Souls Ignite and symphonic rock–art rock Rodrigo San Martín and Maybe.
* The current punk scene in Argentina features no real mainstream bands (besides eternal punks Attaque 77), and an underground scene with different groups. Some of them include Smitten (band); Cadena Perpetua with their well-crafted and tight songs; Romapagana certainly unusual and inspiring with their cosmopolitan mix of language and dynamic sound;Shaila who also features many English lyric songs, unusual for Argentine rock; and veterans 2 Minutos who soldier on.
* Heavy Metal at mid decade features a predominance of nu-metal and doom metal groups; Carajo, Cabezones and a recharged A.N.I.M.A.L. in the former (and all having toured extensively overseas), internationally acclaimed doomsters Los Natas, and Lörihen for the latter. O&#x27;Connor is one of the classic metal revivalists. Under AC/DC&#x27;s influence, La Naranja Metalica consolidated its career.
* In fusion or tropical rock Bersuit Vergarabat still command legions. Dancing Mood is the ska representative on the mainstream, and Nonpalidece is the current reggae-rock band in vogue. Other current bands include Karamelo Santo, Los Calzones, La Mosca Tsé - Tsé, and Kapanga. Ex-Los Fabulosos Cadillacs Vicentico and ex-Todos Tus Muertos Fidel Nadal are both well embarked in their solo careers with fusion rock.
* In alternative, El Otro Yo continue their impressive streak of great albums and fresh sounding music. Catupecu Machu&#x27;s slightly threatening rock has made them a mainstream alternative band, and Babasónicos are arguably the most internationally popular Argentine band today. La Portuaria, after a late 1990s hiatus in a hostile musical climate, returned in the early 2000s as alternative once again resurfaced in Argentina.
* A renovated indie scene with great bands like Jaime Sin Tierra, which created lush beautiful rock before disbanding in 2001 leaving behind the seed for the sound of bands like Las Curvas de Mondrián, 1000 NICKS with their retro rock style, Dalmanerea with their original and creative &quot;meZKla argentina&quot; and Interama and their left-of-the-dial melodies. Entre Rios&#x27;s elegant electro lounge with female vocals is one of the best kept secrets in Argentina&#x27;s indie scene. The indie scene also has a neo-symphonic revival scene with the likes of Pez and A Tirador Laser, bands which are reviving the sound of later 1970s Argentine rock with an updated resonance.
* In addition there is a large indie scene influenced by Krautrock and late 1980s/early 1990s British and American indie-rock acts such as The Pastels, The Vaselines, Jesus and Mary Chain and My Bloody Valentine. Some of the most popular bands from this scene include Iguana Lovers (that started in 1990 with collaborations of Ride (band) members, Mark Gardener and Loz Colbert and the Scottish band The Jesus and Mary Chain), El Mato a un Policia Motorizado and Banda de Turistas. Some Argentine lesser-known bands influenced by late 1980s/early 1990s British and American indie-rock artists are Fun People (Buenos Aires), Sir Hope (Córdoba) and Esto No Es Londres (Córdoba).
* The start of the 2nd generation of Argentine rock solo artists formerly members of great bands of their era: Gustavo Cerati, Indio Solari, Vicentico, Fidel Nadal, etc. Ex-Soda Stereo member Cerati spent most of the early part of the decade in the electronic side of music. In 2006 he returned with his first album of all new music since 2002 (&quot;Ahi Vamos&quot;) where rock was front and center, albeit a more mature rock of a man in the middle age of his life. Ex-Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota Solari&#x27;s debut album &quot;El tesoro de los Inocentes&quot; was seen as the best of 2004. Vicentico and his homonymous debut sold well, but his second effort suffered the sophomore slump. He has just released his third solo album, &quot;Los Pájaros&quot;. Skay Beillinson, also ex-Redonditos, also did well with his fourth solo efforts.
* Many new bands influenced by Redonditos de Ricota are reaching recognition. Those include Mavirock, and Cajale Cazazo.
* The politics of grassroots feminism has had an important influence on Argentine rock artists and on the rock music scene. In 2019, the Congress passed a gender equity law requiring at least 30% of musical festival lineups be women artists. Notable feminist rockers include Marilina Bertoldi, Flopa, Marina Fages, Cam Beszkin, Mujeres Bacanas, Loli Molina, Los Besos, Rosario Bléfari, Lara Pedrosa, ibiza pareo, Sol Bassa, Potra, Florencia Ruiz, Eruca Sativa, and Miss Bolivia.
* The first decade of this century saw the apparition of rock bands singing in English, like Watchmen (not to be confused with The Watchmen, the Canadian band), or the Anglo-Argentine The Draytones. Skiltron, playing Celtic metal, released his first album in 2006. Skiltron split in 2011, giving origin to Triddana. Another Celtic metal is Tersivel (2004), whose first EP was recorded in 2006 and their first full-length album was released in 2010. Other notable English singing bands are Electronomicón (hard rock), Kapel Maister (symphonic metal), 42 decibel (hard rock), , Maxi Trusso, Full Nothing, Siamés, Stöltz and Octafonic.

<text>Route 200, known locally as Saddle Road, traverses the width of the Island of Hawaii, from downtown Hilo to its junction with Hawaii Route 190 near Waimea. The road was once considered one of the most dangerous paved roads in the state, with many one-lane bridges and areas of marginally maintained pavement. Most of the road has now been repaved, and major parts have new re-alignments to modern standards. The highway is mostly one-lane in each direction, but there are two lanes on the uphill portions. The highway reaches a maximum elevation of and is subject to fog and low visibility. Many rental car companies used to prohibit use of their cars on Saddle Road, but now allow use of the road. The highway experiences heavy use as it provides the shortest driving route from Hilo to Kailua-Kona and access to the slopes of Mauna Loa and the Mauna Kea Observatories.

==Route description==

===Waiānuenue Avenue===
The mile marker 0 is posted in Hilo on the traffic signal at the intersection of Waiānuenue Avenue, Kamehameha Avenue and Bayfront Highway at coordinates . The route continues &quot;mauka&quot; along Waiānuenue Avenue to a little over a half-mile past the mile 1 where it veers left onto Kaūmana Drive near Gilbert Carvalho Park. Further along, Waiānuenue Avenue is Rainbow Falls Park (Wai means &quot;water&quot; (fresh) in the Hawaiian language; ānuenue means &quot;rainbow&quot;. Thus &quot;Rainbow Falls&quot; is rendered as Waiānuenue).
*Total miles = 1.7 (2.7 km)

===Kaūmana Drive===

Starting at the “Y” junction adjacent to Gilbert Carvalho Park, Highway 200 continues &quot;mauka&quot; (uphill) on Kaūmana Drive and provides access to neighborhoods overlooking Hilo. The road is quite narrow and windy with many blind corners, hidden driveways and open drainage ditches. Near mile 4 it passes Kaumana Cave, a lava tube. Just past mile 6 (coordinates ) is the junction with Pūainakō Street Extension, (Hawaii Route 2000), completed in September 2004 as a bypass of the above-mentioned windy sections. The intersection with Ua Nahele Street at mile 8 marks the &quot;mauka&quot; terminus of Kaūmana Drive.
*Total miles = 

===Saddle Road===
The official start of Saddle Road is at the “T” intersection of Ua Nahele Street at mile 8. This is the last neighborhood through which the route will pass. As it has from its beginning in Hilo, Route 200 continues to climb towards the Humuula Saddle between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. The rainforest of the Hilo Forest Reserve and Upper Waiākea Forest Reserve surround the roadway and begin to thin as the elevation increases. Quality of the asphalt surface is quite good on this side of the crest but there are many curves and rises with limited visual distances. There are no tourist services or other infrastructure on the Saddle Road.

Reconstruction of the sections from mileposts 11 to 19 and 19 to 28 was finished in November 2011 and October 2008, respectively.
The terrain becomes the high lava desert of the Humuula Saddle. Two roads intersect Saddle Road close to Puu Huluhulu at its crest near mile 28 at above the sea level, the Mauna Loa Observatory Road to the south, and the Mauna Kea Summit Road to the north.

The Mauna Loa Observatory Road is an unmarked long narrow rough (but paved) road which winds its way towards Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, Mauna Loa Atmospheric Observatory, and AMiBA on the slopes of Mauna Loa. It was connected in 1963 to the old Tom Vance road from 1950.
The Mauna Kea Summit Road (known as John A. Burns Way) provides access to the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy (at elevation then climbs Mauna Kea past the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve to the height of at grades averaging 17% making this the third highest public road in the United States. The road is long, of which the first 6 miles (to the Onizuka Center) and the last are paved. Puu Wēkiu is the highest point in Hawaii at and is home to Poliahu, Goddess of Snow. Mauna Kea Observatory on the summit, an ideal location for astronomical seeing, is under the jurisdiction of the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy.

West and northwest of these turnoffs, the segment of Route 200 from milepost 28 to 35 was dedicated and opened to traffic on May 29, 2007, with Senator Daniel K. Inouye as the keynote speaker and other local dignitaries. The new section was constructed to full federal highway standards, with wide shoulders, rumble strips, good signage and emergency phones at regular intervals.

From milepost 35 to 44 the road passes the main gates of Pōhakuloa Training Area and Bradshaw Army Airfield before continuing across the military reservation. Military vehicles – including armored personnel carriers – occasionally cross or occupy the roadway. Artillery exercises, including live fire, are not uncommon. with batteries set up along the roadway firing towards Mauna Loa. This section of the road was repaved in the summer of 2008, greatly improving the conditions.

On August 18, 2009, the completely rebuilt section, from milepost 35 to 42, opened to public travel. The realignment relocated the highway north to the Mauna Kea side of the Army base and Bradshaw Army Airfield.

A new section starting near mile marker 42 that bypasses Waikii and connects to Māmalahoa Highway near mile marker 14, opened September 7, 2013. At this time, the highway was officially renamed the Daniel K. Inouye Highway in honor of the late senator from Hawaii.

This new section avoids the old route, where from milepost 44, near Kilohana, to the Māmalahoa Highway the road retained its original character, a narrow ribbon of poorly maintained pavement with crumbling edges. On the old section, there are several one-lane bridges, blind curves and hills. It is common for drivers to negotiate the center of the road to avoid the rough shoulders, moving back into the lane only when necessary to pass traffic proceeding in the opposite direction. The route is quite scenic with views of the coastline, the Hualālai and Kohala volcanoes, winding its way across Parker Ranch and through the development of Waikii.

The original western terminus of Route 200 comes at its junction with Māmalahoa Highway (state route 190) toward Kona of Waimea (coordinates ).

==History==
In May 1849, Minister of Finance Gerrit P. Judd proposed building a road directly between the two population centers of the Island of Hawaii. Using prison labor, it started near Holualoa Bay at and proceeded in a straight line up to the plateau south of Hualālai. After ten years only about were completed, when work was abandoned at when the 1859 eruption of Mauna Loa blocked its path.
Although destroyed at lower elevations due to residential development, it can still be seen on maps as the &quot;Judd Trail&quot;.

While planning for the defense of the Hawaiian Islands in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the U. S. Army hastily built an access road in 1943 across the Humuula plateau of Parker Ranch at . Since it was not intended as a civilian road, the simple gravel path was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the US Army Corps of Engineers in case of an invasion. Military vehicles of all types and treads traversed the Island for the next three years.

Following the end of World War II in 1945, the Army turned over jurisdiction of the road to the Territory of Hawaii and it was designated &quot;State Route 20&quot;. However, the territorial government had few funds to maintain the road, let alone upgrade it to civilian standards. Much of the paving dates from 1949.

About the same time, Tom Vance, who had earlier supervised building a highway up Mauna Loa named for Governor Ingram Stainback, secretly used his prison laborers to start a more direct Hilo-Kona road. He started at a camp (still called &quot;Vance&quot; on USGS maps) which was exactly midway between Hilo and Kealakekua. The road extended in a straight line, heading for the pass between Hualālai and Mauna Loa.
In 1950, the camp caught fire after construction reached . The public refused to allocate more funding when they discovered about US$1 million had already been spent, so the project was also abandoned.

After the islands became the State of Hawaii in 1959, Saddle Road was handed to the County of Hawaii and for many years only minimal maintenance was performed, leading to generally poor conditions and the source of the road&#x27;s notorious reputation.

Since 1992, there has been increased attention on the road, with efforts to rebuild and renovate the highway into a practical cross-island route. This resulted in repaving some sections and complete rebuilding of others. The entire road is now well paved, and in the uphill sections there is a separate lane for trucks and slower cars.

==Future==
Eventual plans are to complete a section past Māmalahoa Highway down to the coast and intersecting the Queen Kaahumanu Highway (state route 19) to support cross-island commuting by tourists and resort employees. The route for the entirely new sections of the highway was changed after the 2006 expansion of the military exercise areas. Completion of these projects represent a major realignment of island traffic patterns and conversion of this notorious roadway into a modern state highway.

Hawaii Route 2000 is a road on the island of Hawaii, in the state of Hawaii. The road&#x27;s western terminus is at Hawaii Route 200 (known as the Saddle Road). The eastern terminus is at Hawaii Route 11 (known as the Hawaii Belt Road) in Hilo where the Prince Kūhiō Plaza shopping center is located. Route 2000 is called Pūāinakō Street Extension, East Pūāinakō Street, and West Pūāinakō Street. The project was planned since 1995.

<doc id="1248390" wikidata="Q571875" url="?curid=1248390" title="Retrorocket">
<text>A retrorocket (short for &quot;retrograde rocket&quot;) is a rocket engine providing thrust opposing the motion of a vehicle, thereby causing it to decelerate. They have mostly been used in spacecraft, with more limited use in short-runway aircraft landing. New uses are emerging since 2010 for retro-thrust rockets in reusable launch systems.

==History==
Rockets were fitted to the nose of some models of the DFS 230, a World War II German Military glider. This enabled the aircraft to land in more confined areas than would otherwise be possible during an airborne assault.

Another World War II development was the British Hajile project, initiated by the British Admiralty&#x27;s Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. Originally a request from the British Army as a method to drop heavy equipment or vehicles from aircraft flying at high speeds and altitudes, the project turned out to be a disaster and was largely forgotten after the war. Although some of the tests turned out to be successful, Hajile was too unpredictable to be used in conventional warfare, and by the time the war drew to a close, with no chance to put the project into action, it was shelved. Later Soviet experiments used this technique, braking large air-dropped cargos after a parachute descent.

==Uses==

===Deorbit maneuvers===
When a spacecraft in orbit is slowed sufficiently, its altitude decreases to the point at which aerodynamic forces begin to rapidly slow the motion of the vehicle, and it returns to the ground. Without retrorockets, spacecraft would remain in orbit until their orbits naturally slow, and reenter the atmosphere at a much later date; in the case of crewed flights, long after life support systems have been expended. Therefore, it is critical that spacecraft have extremely reliable retrorockets.

====Project Mercury====
Due to the high reliability demanded by de-orbiting retrorockets, Mercury spacecraft used a trio of solid fuel, 1000 lbf (4.5 kN) thrust retrorockets that fired for 10 seconds each, strapped to the heat shield on the bottom of the spacecraft. One was sufficient to return the spacecraft to Earth if the other two failed.

====Project Gemini====
Gemini used four rockets, each , burning for 5.5 seconds in sequence, with a slight overlap. These were mounted in the retrograde section of the adapter module, located just behind the capsule&#x27;s heat shield.

====Apollo program====
For lunar flights, the Apollo command and service module did not require retrorockets to return the command module to Earth, as the flight path took the module through the atmosphere, using atmospheric drag to reduce velocity. The test flights in Earth orbit required retrograde propulsion, which was provided by the large Service Propulsion Engine on the service module. The same engine was used as a retrorocket to slow the spacecraft for lunar orbit insertion. The Apollo Lunar Module used its descent stage engine to drop from orbit and land on the Moon.

====Space Shuttle program====
The Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System provided the vehicle with a pair of powerful liquid-fueled rockets for both reentry and orbital maneuvering. One was sufficient for a successful reentry, and if both systems were to fail, the reaction control system could slow the vehicle enough for reentry.

===Launch vehicle staging===

To ensure clean separation and prevent contact, multistage rockets such as the Titan II, Saturn I, Saturn IB, and Saturn V may have small retrorockets on lower stages, which ignite upon stage separation. For example, they were used to back the S-IC and S-II stages off from the rest of the vehicle after their respective shutdowns during the Saturn V&#x27;s launch to Earth orbit. Meanwhile, the succeeding stage may have posigrade ullage rockets, both to aid separation and ensure good starting of liquid-fuel engines.

===Landers===
Retrorockets are also used in landing spacecraft on other astronomical bodies, such as the Moon and Mars, as well as enabling a spacecraft to enter an orbit around such a body, when otherwise it would scoot past and off into space again. As pointed out above (in connection with Project Apollo) the main rocket on a spacecraft can be re-oriented to serve as a retrorocket. The Soyuz capsule uses small rockets for the last phase of landing.

===Reusable launch systems===
New uses for retro-thrust rockets emerged since 2010 for reusable launch systems. After second stage separation, the first stage of SpaceX&#x27;s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets uses one to three of the main engines in order to decelerate for propulsive landing. The first stage is then recovered, refurbished and prepared for the next flight. The boosters of other orbital rockets are routinely destroyed after a single use by atmospheric reentry and high-speed impact in the ocean. Companies like Blue Origin with their New Glenn, Link Space with their New Line 1 and national projects like the European Commission&#x27;s RETALT project and the China National Space Administration&#x27;s Long March 8 are also pursuing retro-thrust re-entry for reusable boosters.

New Shepard is a reusable single-stage suborbital rocket where the booster uses its main engine to land again after a flight. The capsule slows its descent with parachutes and uses retrorockets to slow down just before reaching the ground.

SpaceX&#x27;s Starship launch vehicle recovers its Super Heavy booster in a similar manner to Falcon 9, lighting thirteen engines, before shutting down ten of these engines for the final descent. The second stage, after reentry, lights its three inner engines and descends to either a splashdown or a catch.

===Operation Credible Sport===
Operation Credible Sport, a plan put forward by the US government in 1979 to rescue the hostages in Iran resulted in the construction of two modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules, designated YMC-130H, which featured retro-rockets to allow it to perform extremely short landings. As part of the plan, these aircraft would land in the Shahid Shiroudi Stadium near the US Embassy in Tehran and use the retrorockets to come to a stop. One aircraft was destroyed in a crash during a test flight without any fatalities, and the plan was scrapped later that year.

<doc id="1248396" wikidata="Q5093820" url="?curid=1248396" title="Chesterfield Railroad">
<text>The Chesterfield Railroad was located in Chesterfield County, Virginia. It was a long mule-and-gravity powered line that connected the Midlothian coal mines with wharves that were located at the head of navigation on the James River just below the Fall Line at Manchester (on the south bank directly across from Richmond). It began operating in 1831 as Virginia&#x27;s first common carrier railroad.

Although it was dismantled before the American Civil War after being supplanted by the steam-powered Richmond and Danville Railroad, several portions of the embankments for the roadbed are extant in Chesterfield County near present-day Midlothian Turnpike.

==History==
Coal mining in the Midlothian area of Chesterfield County began in the 18th century. Around 1701, French Huguenot settlers to the area discovered the existence of the coalfield. The coalfield was part of the Richmond Basin which is one of the Eastern North America Rift Basins which contains some sedimentary rock and bituminous coal. In a 1709 diary entry William Byrd II, who is credited as the founder of Richmond, and had purchased of land in the area where coal was found, noted that &quot;the coaler found the coal mine very good and sufficient to furnish several generations.&quot; It was first commercially mined in the 1730s, and was used to make cannon at Westham (near the present Huguenot Memorial Bridge) during the American Revolutionary War.

In 1804, the Manchester and Falling Creek Turnpike was built to ease traffic on what is now Old Buckingham Road. In 1807, became the first graveled roadway of any length in Virginia. However, by 1824, Midlothian area coal mine owners were frustrated by the difficulty of transporting on the toll road, now known as Midlothian Turnpike, more than 1,000,000 bushels of coal by wagons and horse teams to waiting ships below the falls at Manchester on the banks of the James River.

Seeking a better method of transportation so that their markets could be expanded, in 1825, a group of mine owners, including Nicholas Mills, Beverly Randolph and Abraham S. Wooldridge, resolved to build a tramway. The Wooldridge family hailed from East Lothian and West Lothian in Scotland, and named their mining company Mid-Lothian, the source of the modern name.

===Planning and construction 1827-1831===
In the winter of 1827, Claudius Crozet, Virginia&#x27;s State Engineer, surveyed the proposed route and deemed it feasible for construction. This feasibility study was necessary to obtain funding assistance from the Virginia Board of Public Works, a state agency which, beginning in 1816, invested in a portion of the stock of privately managed companies building canals, turnpikes, and, later, railroads.

In February 1828, the Chesterfield Railroad Company obtained its charter from the Virginia General Assembly. Within a year, $100,000 stock was subscribed, half purchased by the colliers of Chesterfield County and half by Richmond-area investors. The company hired Moncure Robinson, (1802–1891) a European-trained engineer and U.S. railroad pioneer to supervise construction.

In 1830, capital stock was increased to $150,000 to cover unexpectedly high construction expenses. By June 1831, the construction was completed at $127,000 total cost.

===Most profitable railroad in the world 1831-1850===
By September, 1831, the railroad was operational, using horses, mules and gravity as motive power. One hundred sixty cars were put into operation, and it was an instant financial success.

In 1836, the Chesterfield Railroad Company reported carrying 25,903 cars, 84,976 tons (77,089 tonnes) of coal. It received gross revenues of $83,409. This equaled 19% of stockholders&#x27; original investment repaid plus 6% dividend. It was reputed to be the most profitable railroad in the world at the time.

In 1840, one of the mining companies reported that 300,000 bushels of coal were extracted from the -deep Pump Shaft alone, one of the more active mines, using the labor of approximately 150 men and 25 mules. It is believed that most of this coal was shipped out by the Chesterfield Railroad.

By 1844, the Chesterfield Railroad had repaid the stockholders&#x27; entire original investment and consequently came under regulation of Virginia Board of Public Works, which adjusted charges to fix a dividend return of 6%. The rate for carrying coal reduced from 6¢ per bushel to 3¢.

===Outmoded by steam railroad competition 1850-1851===
In 1850, the new steam-driven Richmond and Danville Railroad began operation to Coalfield Station (later renamed Midlothian). Although unsuccessful lawsuits followed, the Chesterfield Railroad was quickly supplanted by the competition. It filed its last report with the Virginia Board of Public Works in 1851. With permission from the state legislature, the Chesterfield Railroad was dismantled before the American Civil War.

==Design features==
Operating its entire lifetime without any locomotives, Chesterfield Railroads moved its railcars loaded with coal mostly by gravity downhill to the docks on the James River at the southern edge of Manchester. In places where the line ran uphill, mules helped the cars climb some slopes. The empty cars were hauled back uphill by the mules to the mine, to be reloaded again. In one area the weight of the loaded cars and their downhill motion pulled the empty cars (connected to the full ones by ropes and drums) back toward the mines.

One of the most remarkable features was a cycloidal inclined plane, a drum and rope device by which loaded coal-carrying cars lowered down the steep western slope of Falling Creek Valley pulled by two empty cars traveling up the slope. On the eastern side, the loaded cars were then raised over a distance, with power supplied by animals. After completing that movement, the roadbed was mostly a gradual downhill slope over relatively level terrain towards Manchester.

==Revenues==
*1843: $37,104.43 for 11,496 cars (822,200 bushels)
*1847: $37,329.55 for 20,694 cars (1,552,050 bushels)
*1849: $39,591.95 for 17,723 cars of coal (1,329,225 bushels)

==Presidents==
* Nicholas Mills
* George Fisher (1843)

==Heritage &amp; remnants==
The Chesterfield Railroad is commemorated by two Virginia Historical Markers and an exhibit in the Chesterfield County Museum, located near the court house. In addition, various portions of the road bed still exist today.

===Gallery===
====&quot;First Railroad in Virginia&quot; Historical marker &amp; remnant site nearby====
Historical marker |VA-S30,
is located on U.S. Route 60, at Pocoshock Creek, 3.78 miles (6.08 km) west of the Richmond city limits at State Route 150, and 1.5 miles (2.41 km) west of the junctions of US Highway 60 and State Route 76.

At this location, a short portion of the former rail bed on a fill is still visible just south of the marker, between a retail center and a condominium complex.

====&quot;Chesterfield Railroad &quot; Virginia Historical marker &amp; remnant site nearby====

Historical marker |VA-O64 is located about east of the Village of Midlothian in U.S. Route 60.

Just west of this marker, the site of the cycloidal inclined plane on the steep western slope of Falling Creek Valley is still recognizable and juxtaposes the remains of the railroad bridge at Falling Creek. The location is about east of the Village of Midlothian on U.S. Route 60.

====Chesterfield County Museum====
An exhibit on local mining history in the Chesterfield Museum includes a length of iron rail from the incline railway, first in Virginia.

====Extant Remnants====
After its discontinuation in 1851, the Chesterfield Railroad roadbed was used as a trail or road for various sections and as a property boundary. In the 20th century, Richmond greatly expanded and much of the old roadbed has been demolished to make way for new developments. Some sections still remain:
* The first half mile before terminating in the Stonehenge Village shopping center
* A tenth of a mile from Alverser Drive to the Jaguar car dealership
* A quarter of a mile centering on Pocoshock Creek
* A few long sections around Chippenham Parkway

Furthermore, some sections of the spur lines exist: a twentieth of a mile section of the spur to the Chesterfield Coal and Iron Mining Company (formerly known locally as the &quot;English&quot; company) southeast of the intersection of Walton Park Road and Walton Park Lane and a few sections of the Midlothian company spur, which the Richmond and Danville Railroad used as the southern part of its Midlothian spur.

==Career==
He worked as a journalist for the &quot;Akron Beacon-Journal&quot;, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, and the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;. In 1969, he left for Canada to protest American involvement in Vietnam. Todd settled in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. He worked for the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, Radio Canada International, and the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;.

In 2000, he won the National Newspaper Award for sports-writing and is recognized as one of Canada&#x27;s leading sports journalists.

In 2001, he published a memoir, telling the story of his resistance to the war in Vietnam which was nominated for the Governor-General&#x27;s Award. The Canadian title is &quot;The Taste of Metal&quot;, while the U.S. title is &quot;Desertion: In the Time of Vietnam&quot;.

In 2008, Todd published his first work of fiction, &quot;Sun Going Down&quot;, a novel on the opening of the American West based on his family history as constituted from letters and diaries. It was followed in 2010 with &quot;Come Again No More&quot;, which follows the family through the Great Depression. The final work in the trilogy, &quot;Rain Falls Like Mercy&quot;, was published in 2011. Todd was interviewed for Ken Burns&#x27; 2017 miniseries &quot;The Vietnam War&quot;.

<doc id="1248425" wikidata="Q739689" url="?curid=1248425" title="Jib (camera)">
<text>In cinematography, a jib is any boom device used to mount a camera on one end, and a counterweight with camera controls on the other. In principle, it operates like a see-saw, with the balance point located closer to the counterweight, which allows the end of the arm with the camera to move through an extended arc. Typically a jib permits the camera to be moved vertically, horizontally, or a combination of the two. A small jib can be mounted on a tripod, but many larger, purpose-built jibs have their own support stands, often on wheels. Modern jibs are normally modular and can be assembled in various lengths.

== Use ==
A jib can be used for getting high or low shots which are difficult for a hand-held camera operator to get, or shots which need to move a short distance horizontally or vertically, without the expense and safety issues of putting a camera operator on a crane for a crane shot or laying track for a camera dolly. A jib can even be mounted on a dolly for shots in which the camera moves over obstacles such as furniture, when a normal dolly shot could not be used.

== Operation ==
A jib is more complicated than a simple lever, since almost always the camera&#x27;s aim needs to be controlled independently of the swing of the jib arm. This can be done either by relatively simple mechanical means or by the use of remotely controlled electric servo motors as used in a remote head.

Since the camera operator is usually not able to use the camera&#x27;s controls directly or look through the camera&#x27;s viewfinder, a jib is often used in conjunction with a remote control systems for focus, and/or zoom and/or camera function and with a portable video monitor mounted near the jib operator.

A device known as a &quot;hot head&quot; or &quot;remote head&quot; is attached to the camera end of larger jibs. It supports the camera and enables remote pan/tilt functions with focus/zoom control. This setup can be operated by one person, or the circumstance may require two operators. In a two-operator situation, one person operates the jib arm/boom while another operates the pan/tilt/zoom functions of the remote head. An example of this is the Newton stabilized remote head, that stabilizes the camera under fast jib operation and also enables camera roll.

<doc id="1248428" wikidata="Q25674" url="?curid=1248428" title="Game Boy Advance Video">
<text>Game Boy Advance Video is a format for putting full color, full-motion videos onto Game Boy Advance ROM cartridges. These videos are playable using the Game Boy Advance system&#x27;s screen and sound hardware. They were all published by Majesco Entertainment, except for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; Game Boy Advance Video cartridges, which were published by Nintendo. Most cartridges were developed by DC Studios, Inc., except for the few labelled &quot;Movie Pak&quot; which were developed by 4Kids Entertainment&#x27;s subsidiary 4Kids Technology, Inc. The video cartridges are colored white for easy identification and are sold as &quot;Game Boy Advance Video Paks&quot;; these offer the same 240×160 resolution as standard Game Boy Advance games, except for the &quot;Shrek and Shark Tale&quot; pack, which is at 112p.

==History==
The product was originally announced as GBA-TV in 2003. Game Boy Advance Video Paks first became available in North America in May 2004. In June 2004, Majesco had expanded its Game Boy Advance Video licenses into other categories. They had also expanded the library to include shows from Nickelodeon, Nick Jr, Cartoon Network, and Funimation, in addition to the existing 4Kids cartridges. In November 2004, Majesco started to sell GBA Video Paks featuring several Disney Channel animated series, including &quot;Brandy &amp; Mr. Whiskers&quot;, &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot;, and &quot;The Proud Family&quot;. In November 2005, Majesco began to sell GBA Video Paks featuring full-length animated films from DreamWorks Animation including &quot;Shrek 2&quot; and &quot;Shark Tale&quot;. A special GBA Video Pak containing the films &quot;Shrek&quot; and &quot;Shark Tale&quot; combined into one cartridge was released in 2006.

==Copy protection==
Game Boy Advance Video Paks are viewable only on Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, Game Boy Micro, Nintendo DS, and Nintendo DS Lite systems, as the owners of copyright in the television shows requested that Majesco prevent people from using the GameCube&#x27;s Game Boy Player accessory to play and record the shows onto VHS tapes or DVDs. However, the low resolution (both for the time and especially by modern standards) and mono sound would result in a low-quality video output on a TV regardless, thus making it significantly inferior to VHS and DVD. Unlike Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2 and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox video game consoles, the Nintendo GameCube cannot output Macrovision gain-control copy distortion signals. The GBA Video Paks perform a check when inserted into the Game Boy Player, using the same logo authentication method used by Game Boy Advance games that support controller rumble, and will freeze with the message &quot;Not compatible with Game Boy Player&quot; if they detect the Game Boy Player in use. 

==Disadvantages==
Because of the low capacity of Game Boy Advance cartridges (normally ranging from 4 to 32 MB, though the video cartridges can reach sizes of 64 MB) and the length of the video content (generally feature-length movies and episodes), GBA Video Paks are heavily compressed, with visual artifacts marring nearly every frame. The image quality has a similar appearance to early Cinepak compression, and the &quot;quilting&quot; and color bleeding effect found in other compressed video formats is also present. The opening theme for Pokémon is also slightly shortened. Also, in cases where certain videos are available both as a 45-minute two-part episodes or a 22-minute edited version, the 22-minute version is used. The proprietary codec created by DC Studios is described in detail in the Majesco patents.

==Additional information==
Game Boy Advance Video Paks were the feature prize in Vol. 183 of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; Magazine, as part of its players poll sweepstakes, in which five grand prize winners would receive a Game Boy Advance SP and twenty GBA Video Paks. Most GBA Video Paks cost US$9.95 and feature 40 to 45 minutes of video content. GBA Video Movie Paks cost US$19.99 and feature up to a 90-minute movie.

Some GBA Video Movie Paks came packaged with headphones.

<doc id="1248434" wikidata="Q640991" url="?curid=1248434" title="Gustaf Retzius">
<text>Prof Magnus Gustaf (or Gustav) Retzius FRSFor HFRSE MSA (17 October 1842 – 21 July 1919) was a Swedish physician and anatomist who dedicated a large part of his life to researching the histology of the sense organs and nervous system.

==Life==
Retzius was born in Stockholm, son of the anatomist Anders Retzius (and grandson of the naturalist and chemist Anders Jahan Retzius). He enrolled at Uppsala University in 1860, and received his &quot;medicine kandidat&quot; degree there in 1866, transferred to the Karolinska Institute, where he received a Licentiate of Medical Science (&quot;Medicine licentiatexamen&quot;) degree in 1869 and completed his doctorate in medicine (PhD) in 1871 at Lund University. Retzius worked as an assistant under pathologist Axel Key; the two had a long partnership, publishing research together and the popular science .

He received an extraordinary professorship in histology at the Karolinska Institute in 1877 and an ordinary professorship in anatomy there in 1889 (acting from 1888), but resigned in 1890 after conflicts with other members of the institute. As he was married to the feminist Anna Hierta, daughter of the founder of the newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; Lars Johan Hierta, his personal wealth allowed him to pursue his research and writing without any stable employment. Moreover, Retzius served as the editor of the newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; (1884–1887) and was also a journalist there.

==Journeys to Egypt and North America==
Retzius traveled outside of Europe twice, both times together with his wife Anna. During these trips he was keen to buy ethnographic and archaeological collections for a planned ethnographic museum in Stockholm.

===Egypt 1889–1890===
In the winter of 1889–1890, they visited Egypt. Retzius published articles from the trip in Aftonbladet, which later came to be published as a book &quot;Skizzer och uppsatser: Bilder från Nilens land (&quot;Sketches and essays: Pictures from the Nile country). For two weeks departing from Cairo on Christmas Day, they traveled on the Nile. They first traveled up the river to the city of Aswan. There Retzius purchased collections in the bazaars. Soon the sellers realized that Retzius was a customer who could pay and they came to the boat and offered their goods and items directly from the beach. Retzius was looking for skulls for his anthropological studies and managed to acquire 30 &quot;mummies&quot; during an excursion from Aswan to some rock graves across the Nile where a &quot;caretaker&quot; on site sold the skulls to Retzius. Through some English officers he also managed to acquire six skulls from the Battle of Toski. On the way back down the Nile, they visited both Karnak and Luxor. In Luxor, he managed to buy a total of 125 skulls with the help of consul Ahmed Effendi Moustapha Ayyâd who sent out a person to dig up graves and bring the skulls. Once back in Cairo, Retzius had the opportunity to meet the famous Henry Morton Stanley, who just performed his failed expedition to liberate Emin Pascha. In Cairo, Retzius made further purchases of collections. Large parts of Retzius&#x27;s collections are available at Medelhavsmuseet in Stockholm and at the Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm.

===North America 1893===

During six months beginning in June 1893, the Retzius couple traveled in North America. Just as during the trip to Egypt, an important goal was to buy collections for the future ethnographic museum, as well as to visit colleagues and their institutions. Also during this trip, Retzius reported in articles in Aftonbladet under the heading &quot;Pictures from North America&quot;. However, there was never a book. The first visit was to Yale and the paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh who was followed by several other university visits. They visited the World&#x27;s exhibition in Chicago where they, among other things, saw ethnographic exhibitions and also several different indigenous people who performed and danced. Here they met the Danish Adrian Jacobsen and the famous Franz Boas. After the world exhibition, they visited several different places and cities, including Santa Fe. They get this opportunity to visit an &quot;Indian settlement&quot; outside the city. In Santa Fe there was an antique shop called Jake Gold&#x27;s Free Museum (Gold&#x27;s Old Curiosity Shop) where Retzius bought ethnography. For a few weeks, they visited the northwest coast and British Columbia. They came to the city of Victoria, where there were several traders for ethnography, and then traveled on the Vancouver Island. In Bella Bella, they met Adrian Jacobsen&#x27;s brother Filip Jacobsen who made it possible for Anna and Gustaf to visit several different places during a 12-day trip and also to purchase ethnographic collections. A large part of the objects in the stores in Victoria had been collected by the Jacobsen brothers. Gustaf and Anna were dismayed at the methods used by the dealers to trick the indigenous people to relinquish older items that were not for sale. They were also critical of the missionaries in the area. Gustaf did not get as many skulls during this trip in comparison to the Egyptian journey, but he managed to acquire four so-called &quot;longhead&quot; skulls. The trip home to Sweden went via stops in several cities, including Chicago again, Baltimore and Washington. Large parts of the collections Retzius acquired during his journey can be found at the Ethnographic Museum.

==Research==
Retzius published more than 300 scientific works in anatomy, embryology, eugenics, craniometry, zoology and botany. He gave his name to the 60 micrometer-diameter Retzius cells in the central nervous system of the leech (&quot;Hirudo medicinalis&quot;).

During his time at the Karolinska Institute, he made important contributions to anatomical descriptions of the muscles of the eardrum, the bones of the middle ear, and the Eustachian tube.

His 1896 2-volume work &quot;Das Menschenhirn&quot; (&quot;The Human Brain&quot;) was perhaps the most important treatise written on the gross anatomy of the human brain during the 19th century.

He also studied ancient Swedish and Finnish skulls, following the steps of his father Anders Retzius, who had studied the crania of different human &quot;races&quot; and made pseudoscientific contributions to phrenology. Retzius was one of the fathers of the pseudoscientific race theory, &quot;scientific racism&quot;, trying to glorify the &quot;Nordic race&quot; as the highest race of mankind.

==Swedish Academy==
Retzius was politically and socially active. Together with his wife he founded the Hierta-Retzius foundation, which is now administered by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which Retzius was a member of from 1879. The foundation has two funds, one for the promotion of biological research and the other for supporting projects of an important scientific or social nature.

In 1901 Retzius became a member of the Swedish Academy, following Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld&#x27;s demise. He was also a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. As a result, he took part in the awarding of the Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry and Literature for years. However, his resignation from his chair in anatomy in 1890 meant that he could not participate directly in the choice of the Physiology or Medicine awardee; although he was an active nominator for that prize from 1901 to 1906, always including Santiago Ramón y Cajal. In addition, he could not send nominations for the other prizes.

During the decision process of the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Retzius ardently stood up for a sole awarding to Santiago Ramón y Cajal, thus excluding Camillo Golgi. This was the same view held by in his report for the Nobel Committee. On the contrary, the evaluation by Carl Sundberg favoured Golgi over Cajal. Before the final decision, the written opinion of , who shared Holmgren&#x27;s views was also taken into account. In the end, Cajal and Golgi were jointly awarded, being the first time this Prize was shared between two laureates.

Retzius himself was also a Nobel Prize nominee himself 23 times, in 11 different years from 1901 to 1916. Curiously, he was nominated by Cajal before 1906 and by Golgi after that year.

==Death==
He died in 1919 in Stockholm. He was survived by his wife. His seat at the Swedish Academy was taken by Adolf Noreen that same year.

<doc id="1248438" wikidata="Q4653103" url="?curid=1248438" title="Anzac spirit">
<text>The Anzac spirit or Anzac legend is a concept which suggests that Australian and New Zealand soldiers possess shared characteristics, specifically the qualities those soldiers allegedly exemplified on the battlefields of World War I. These perceived qualities include endurance, courage, ingenuity, good humour, larrikinism, and mateship. According to this concept, the soldiers are perceived to have been innocent and fit, stoical and laconic, irreverent in the face of authority, naturally egalitarian, and disdainful of British class differences.

The Anzac spirit also tends to capture the idea of an Australian and New Zealand &quot;national character&quot;, with the Gallipoli Campaign sometimes described as the moment of birth of the nationhood both of Australia and of New Zealand. It was first expressed in the reporting of the landing at Anzac Cove by Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett; as well as later on and much more extensively by Charles Bean. It is regarded as an Australian legend, although its critics refer to it as the &quot;Anzac myth&quot;.

==Historical development of the concept==
The British war correspondent Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett provided the first reports of the landing at Anzac Cove by the newly formed Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). His report was published in Australia on 8 May 1915: They waited neither for orders nor for the boats to reach the beach, but, springing out into the sea, they waded ashore, and, forming some sort of rough line, rushed straight on the flashes of the enemy&#x27;s rifles.
Ashmead-Bartlett&#x27;s account of the soldiers was unashamedly heroic:

There has been no finer feat in this war than this sudden landing in the dark and the storming of the heights... General Birdwood told the writer that he couldn&#x27;t sufficiently praise the courage, endurance and the soldierly qualities of the Colonials (The Australians) were happy because they had been tried for the first time and not found wanting.

Also in 1915, in response to the reporting of the efforts of the Australian troops, the Australian poet Banjo Paterson wrote &quot;We&#x27;re All Australians Now&quot;, including the verse: 
&lt;poem&gt;The mettle that a race can show
Is proved with shot and steel,
And now we know what nations know
And feel what nations feel.&lt;/poem&gt;

The Anzac spirit was particularly popularised by Charles Bean, Australia&#x27;s official war historian. For the soldiers at Battle of Gallipoli, Bean argued, life would not have been worth living if they had betrayed the ideal of mateship. Despite the loss at Gallipoli, Australian and New Zealand soldiers were seen to have displayed great courage, endurance, initiative and discipline. The Anzac rejected unnecessary restrictions, possessed a sardonic sense of humour, was contemptuous of danger, and proved himself the equal of anyone on the battlefield. Bean encapsulated the meaning of Anzac in his publication &quot;Anzac to Amiens&quot;:

Anzac stood, and still stands, for reckless valor in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship, and endurance that will never own defeat.

1958 saw the publication of Russel Ward&#x27;s &quot;The Australian Legend&quot;. Promoting the egalitarianism of the Australian bush and its permutation into the Anzac soldiers as the Australian Legend, it soon became a landmark book in Australian historical writing. During the 1960s and 1970s, due to lack of observance of Anzac Day in general society, the idea of a unique Anzac spirit began to fade. Especially among baby boomers, interest in Anzac Day reached its lowest point in the aftermath of the anti-war demonstrations over Australian involvement in the Vietnam War. A resurgence in popular commemoration of Anzac Day in the 1980s (possibly linked to the release of the film &quot;Gallipoli&quot;) brought the idea of an Anzac spirit back into prominence in Australian political discourse. There has been an increase in people, especially youth, attending Anzac Day Dawn Services in Australia and New Zealand, where the Anzac spirit is often invoked.

==National identity==
Coming just fourteen years after the Federation of Australia, the Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians. As such, it has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity. According to history professor Dr Frank Bongiorno:

The Gallipoli campaign was the beginning of true Australian nationhood. When Australia went to war in 1914, many white Australians believed that their Commonwealth had no history, that it was not yet a true nation, that its most glorious days still lay ahead of it. In this sense the Gallipoli campaign was a defining moment for Australia as a new nation.

 Ernest Scott&#x27;s influential &quot;A Short History of Australia&quot;, which remained a standard school text for nearly four decades from 1916 and went through six editions in its author&#x27;s lifetime, clearly enunciated this concept. In the preface to the book&#x27;s first edition, Scott linked the European settlement of Australia with the idea of Australia becoming a nation on the battlefields of Gallipoli:

This Short History of Australia begins with a blank space on the map and ends with the record of a new name on the map, that of Anzac.

Charles Bean also propagated this view, extending the notion to suggest that New Zealand nationhood was also born in the First World War. In 1924 Bean wrote that:

Anzac Day now belongs to the past and during the war all energy was concentrated on the future but the influence of the Gallipoli Campaign upon the national life of Australia and New Zealand has been far too deep to fade… it was on the 25th of April 1915 that the consciousness of nationhood was born.

The popular belief that the Anzacs, through their spirit, forged Australia&#x27;s national character, is still today frequently expressed. For example, in 2006 the Governor-General of Australia, Michael Jeffery gave an address in which he said that although the Anzacs lost the campaign they created a lasting identity for Australia:

We are summoned to recall the battle sacrifices of Australian farmers and tally clerks, teachers and labourers and to commemorate outstanding courage and strength of character in the face of sustained adversity... [The campaign] won for us an enduring sense of national identity based on those iconic traits of mateship, courage, compassion and nous.

An extension of this belief is the idea that the Anzacs set an example for future generations of Australians to follow, laying the bedrock of &quot;Australian values&quot;. In 2007 the Australian Defence Minister Brendan Nelson articulated this view, stating that the Anzacs &quot;forged values that are ours and make us who we are, reminding us that there are some truths by which we live.&quot; Nelson had earlier argued that the story of Simpson and his donkey rescuing wounded men at Gallipoli &quot;represents everything that&#x27;s at the heart of what it means to be an Australian&quot;.

The Anzac spirit is also sometimes said to be exhibited during Australian civilian crises. For example, the Returned and Services League of Australia states: The Spirit of the ANZAC continues today in times of hardship such as cyclones, floods and bush fires. At those times Australians come together to rescue one another, to ease suffering, to provide food and shelter, to look after one another, and to let the victims of these disasters know they are not alone.

In New Zealand, the Anzac spirit is similarly pointed to in some quarters as forming an important component of New Zealand national identity. The New Zealand Government&#x27;s Ministry of Culture and Heritage states:

New Zealand soldiers distinguished themselves with their courage and skill, establishing an enduring bond with the Australians they fought alongside ... Great suffering was caused to a small country by the loss of so many of its young men. But the Gallipoli campaign showcased attitudes and attributes - bravery, tenacity, practicality, ingenuity, loyalty to King and comrades - that helped New Zealand define itself as a nation, even as it fought unquestioningly on the other side of the world in the name of the British Empire. After Gallipoli, New Zealand had a greater confidence in its distinct identity, and a greater pride in the international contribution it could make. And the mutual respect earned during the fighting formed the basis of the close ties with Australia that continue today.

==Criticism==
Professor Manning Clark, in his influential work &quot;A History of Australia&quot;, suggested a contrasting image of the innocent and honourable Anzac soldier. From a range of sources he provided evidence of the soldiers&#x27; bad behaviour. For example, he documented that, as recruits, some indulged in sex orgies with an 18-year-old girl at the Broadmeadows camp before being shipped to war. Others confronted police in violent scuffles on the streets of Melbourne. Clark also recorded that in Egypt some soldiers burned the belongings of local people, brawled, got drunk and rioted.

Other scholars such as professor of politics at La Trobe University, Robert Manne, have also questioned the veracity of the Anzac legend, arguing that it is more accurate to describe the concept as a mythology. Dr Dale Blair of Deakin University suggests that:

While traits such as egalitarianism, resourcefulness and initiative are assumed and maintained in the nation&#x27;s popular memory as a truthful representation, not only of Australia&#x27;s First World War soldiers, but also, of the national character, they were not sufficiently evident in the experience of the 1st Battalion [at Gallipoli] to justify their advancement as characteristics general to Australian soldiers or the nation.

According to Blair, the official war historian Charles Bean &quot;advanced an idealised view of sacrifice to provide the nation with higher meaning and comfort as compensation for the death of its soldiers&quot;. Bean wrote in his diary that the &quot;rule of censorship forbids criticism&quot;, and that the war correspondent should avoid &quot;needlessly distressing their families at home&quot;. Professor Verity Burgmann of the University of Melbourne argues that the prevailing picture of Anzac and later battles on the Western Front as the highest representation of national unity and shared sacrifice is a misrepresentation, because two conscription referendums were defeated in Australia, and many Australians were totally opposed to any participation in the war. Conflicting reports on the factual events of the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, continue to surface with conflicting eye-witness reporting.
Other sceptics have questioned the idea that Australia&#x27;s &quot;national character&quot; was forged on the beaches of Gallipoli. In 2008 an editorial in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated:

But why should Australians now, 90 years later, be still so eager for some stereotypical reaffirmation of their character? Why the self-doubt? The danger in the transformation - as remembrance replaces memory, and nationalism replaces remembrance - is that the solemnity and the serious purpose of Anzac Day will be lost in an irrelevant search for some kind of essence of Australianness.

Similarly, historian Mark McKenna disputes the notion that the character traits that supposedly define the Anzac spirit are uniquely and demonstrably Australian, arguing that these virtues are in fact universal, being &quot;found in Palestine and Iraq, in Darfur and East Timor, in Afghanistan and Zimbabwe.&quot;

Alan Young, a World War II veteran and film maker, presents a different view of the origins of the Anzac tradition in his film
&quot;Forging the Anzac Tradition, The Untold Story&quot;. Young argues that &quot;If Gallipoli is the birthplace of the Anzac acronym, then the Western Front is where the Anzac legend grew up, stood tall and cemented their place in international history; and in our hearts&quot;. He points out that five times the number of men died in the &quot;real war&quot; at the Western Front than at the disastrous Gallipoli diversion, yet many Australians know very little of this sacrifice.

Some have also critiqued the masculine underpinnings of the Anzac legend. According to popular notions of the Anzac spirit, the male bonding or mateship becomes the main characteristic in the description of Australianess, yet these characteristics are seen to imply that the true Australian is inevitably and only male. Some feminists have therefore described this notion as being exclusionary and discriminatory, and contend that, as a result, it cannot possibly define what it means to be Australian. Professor Joy Damousi has questioned a view of an Australian national character which relies exclusively on militarism and heroism, arguing that this obscures a more complex, diverse and inclusive understanding of identity.

More broadly, Dr Martin Ball of the University of Melbourne argues that conflating the Anzac spirit with a collective Australian national character exposes an uncritically narrow understanding of Australian history:

The Anzac tradition holds many values for us all to celebrate, but the myth also suppresses parts of Australian history that are difficult to deal with. Anzac is a means of forgetting the origins of Australia. The Aboriginal population is conveniently absent. The convict stain is wiped clean. Postwar immigration is yet to broaden the cultural identity of the population.

<doc id="1248450" wikidata="Q713462" url="?curid=1248450" title="Lesley J. McNair">
<text>Lesley James McNair (25 May 1883 – 25 July 1944) was a senior United States Army officer who served during World War I and World War II. He attained the rank of lieutenant general during his life; he was killed in action during World War II, and received a posthumous promotion to general.

A Minnesota native and 1904 graduate of the United States Military Academy, McNair was a Field Artillery officer with a background in the Ordnance Department. A veteran of the Veracruz occupation and Pancho Villa Expedition, during World War I he served as assistant chief of staff for training with the 1st Division, and then chief of artillery training on the staff at the American Expeditionary Forces headquarters. His outstanding performance resulted in his promotion to temporary brigadier general; at age 35, he was the Army&#x27;s second-youngest general officer.

McNair&#x27;s experience of more than 30 years with equipment and weapons design and testing, his administrative skills, and his success in the areas of military education and training led to his World War II assignment as commander of Army Ground Forces. In this position, McNair became the &quot;unsung architect of the U.S. Army&quot;, and played a leading role in the organizational design, equipping, and training of Army units in the United States before they departed for overseas combat. While historians continue to debate some of McNair&#x27;s decisions and actions, including the individual replacement system for killed and wounded soldiers, and a controversy over the use of tanks or tank destroyers as anti-tank weapons, his concentration on advanced officer education, innovative weapons systems, improved doctrine, realistic combat training, and development of combined arms tactics enabled the Army to modernize and perform successfully on the World War II battlefield, where the mobility of mechanized forces replaced the static defenses of World War I as the primary tactical consideration.

He was killed by friendly fire while in France to act as commander of the fictitious First United States Army Group, part of the Operation Quicksilver deception that masked the actual landing sites for the Invasion of Normandy. During Operation Cobra, an Eighth Air Force bomb landed in his foxhole near Saint-Lô when the Army attempted to use heavy bombers for close air support of infantry operations as part of the Battle of Normandy.

==Early life==

McNair was born in Verndale, Minnesota, on May 25, 1883, the son of James (1846–1932) and Clara (Manz) McNair (1853–1925). He was the second-born of their six children, and the first son. His siblings who lived to adulthood were: sister Nora (1881–1971), the wife of Harry Jessup; brother Murray Manz McNair (1888–1976); and sister Irene (1890–1979), the wife of Harry R. Naftalin.

McNair attended school in Verndale through the ninth grade, the highest available locally; his parents then relocated to Minneapolis so McNair and his siblings could complete high school. After graduating from South High School in 1897, he competed successfully for an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. While he was on the Naval Academy waiting list as an alternate, he began studies at the Minnesota School of Business in Minneapolis, where he concentrated primarily on mechanical engineering and statistics courses.

Frustrated with the wait to start at the Naval Academy, in 1900 McNair competed for appointment to the United States Military Academy and took an examination offered by U.S. Senators Cushman Kellogg Davis and Knute Nelson. Initially selected as an alternate in July 1900, he was quickly accepted as a member of the class that began that August. While at West Point, his fellow students nicknamed him &quot;Whitey&quot; for his ash blond hair; they continued to use it with him for the rest of his life. The description of McNair which accompanied the photo of him in West Point&#x27;s yearbook for his senior year refers to him as &quot;Pedestrian Whitey&quot; and details an incident when he had to walk from Newburgh to West Point, a distance of , after having missed the last train while returning from visiting his fiancée in New York City; the yearbook also contains an anonymously authored poem, &quot;&#x27;Whitey&#x27;s&#x27; Record Walk&quot;, about the same incident.

Several of McNair&#x27;s classmates also went on to prominent careers in the Army, including George R. Allin, Charles School Blakely, Robert M. Danford, Pelham D. Glassford, Edmund L. Gruber, Henry Conger Pratt, Henry J. Reilly, Joseph Stilwell, and Innis P. Swift. McNair graduated in 1904, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. The top five or six graduates usually chose the engineer branch; McNair&#x27;s high class standing (11th of 124) earned him a place in the second choice of most high-ranking graduates, the artillery branch.

==Early career==

McNair was first assigned as a platoon leader with the 12th Battery of Mountain Artillery at Fort Douglas, Utah. While there, he requested duty with the Ordnance Department, and passed a qualifying examination. After approval of his transfer request, he was first assigned to Sandy Hook Proving Ground, New Jersey, where he began a lifelong interest in testing and experimenting with new equipment and weapons. Initially, McNair&#x27;s Ordnance testing centered on improving the mountain guns used by units including his 12th Battery for artillery support of troops in rugged terrain where limbers and caissons could not travel.

After assignment to the staff of the Army&#x27;s Chief of Ordnance from 1905 to 1906, McNair was assigned to the Watertown Arsenal, where he completed self-directed academic studies in metallurgy and other scientific topics. In this posting, he gained experience with both laboratory and practical methods of experimentation, including analyzing bronze, steel, and cast iron to determine the best materials to use in manufacturing cannons and other weapons. In addition, he gained firsthand experience with the uses and applications of several foundry machines, including forges, steam hammers, lathes, planing machines, and boring machines. His business college background in statistical analysis and engineering (including technical drawing) helped make him successful at testing and experimentation; as a result of his experience at Watertown, for the rest of his career the Army frequently relied on him to oversee boards that developed and tested weapons and other equipment, and made recommendations on which items were most suitable for procurement and fielding. He was promoted to temporary first lieutenant in July 1905, and permanent first lieutenant in January 1907. In May 1907, McNair was promoted to temporary captain. (His higher temporary ranks applied in the Ordnance branch, but not in the Artillery.)

==Pre-World War I==

In 1909, McNair returned to the Artillery branch and was assigned to the 4th Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Russell, Wyoming. Assigned to command of Battery C, he earned accolades for his leadership skills and technical expertise. Jacob L. Devers, who was assigned to Battery C after his 1909 West Point graduation, recalled McNair as an outstanding commander who set a superior personal example, and knew how to motivate his subordinates to perform to a high standard. During his battery command, McNair also worked with mixed success on recommendations to modernize pack howitzers, pack saddles, ammunition carriers, and other equipment (much of it of his own design) for the Army&#x27;s mule-transported mountain artillery. In 1909, McNair commanded the 4th Artillery&#x27;s Battery D at Fort Riley, Kansas, during tests designed to determine the battle-worthiness of different types of defensive works if they were attacked by various types of cannons and howitzers. In 1911, he received three patents (998,711; 998,712; 1,007,223) for his designs of new artillery projectiles.
McNair&#x27;s skills in technical drawing, engineering, prototype building, and statistical analysis began to be known Army-wide; in 1912 the commandant of the Field Artillery School requested him by name for assignment to his staff. Instructors at the school had spent more than a year gathering information on 7,000 rounds fired during tests and field exercises; because the school was short-staffed, the commandant called on McNair to compile the data into firing tables that would make it easier for Artillery crews Army-wide to plan and control indirect fire. While carrying out this assignment in 1913, he also spent seven months in France to observe and gather information on the French Army&#x27;s artillery training, education, and employment.

In April 1914, McNair was promoted to permanent captain, and from April to November 1914, McNair took part in the Veracruz Expedition as the 4th Field Artillery Regiment&#x27;s commissary officer. Assigned following another by name request, this time from regimental commander Lucien Grant Berry, McNair was responsible for procuring, storing, maintaining, accounting for, and distributing the regiment&#x27;s materiel, including equipment and weapons. During 1915 and 1916, he was again assigned to the Field Artillery School, where he continued to work on procedures for the implementation of the firing table data he had published. He also continued to experiment with different types of artillery pieces so he could make manufacturing and procurement recommendations as the Army began to prepare for possible involvement in World War I. He returned to the 4th Field Artillery Regiment for the Pancho Villa Expedition on the Texas-Mexico border; initially an unassigned staff officer available for additional duties, he later commanded a battery.

==World War I==

In April 1917, the United States entered World War I. The next month, he was promoted to major and assigned to temporary duty as an instructor for the officer training camp at Leon Springs, Texas. After his Leon Springs assignment, McNair was assigned to the newly created 1st Division, then located at Camp Stewart, in El Paso County, Texas. Assigned to the division headquarters as assistant chief of staff for training, McNair was given responsibility for the organization&#x27;s pre-deployment mobilization, individual soldier training, and collective unit training. When the division departed for France in June, McNair shared quarters aboard ship with the division&#x27;s assistant chief of staff for operations, Captain George C. Marshall. During their long ocean voyage, they forged a personal and professional bond that they maintained for the rest of their careers.

McNair was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel in August, soon after his arrival in France, and was assigned to the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) headquarters as chief of artillery training and tactics in the AEF staff&#x27;s training division (G-5). He was promoted to temporary colonel in June 1918, and temporary brigadier general that October; at age 35, he was the second-youngest general officer in the Army. (Pelham D. Glassford, a West Point classmate and fellow field artilleryman, was also promoted to brigadier general in October 1918, and he was three months younger than McNair.) He continued to impress his superiors with his technical and tactical expertise, and at the end of the war he received the Army Distinguished Service Medal from General John J. Pershing, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the AEF, and the French Legion of Honor (Officer) from Philippe Pétain. The citation for the Army DSM reads:

The Armistice of 11 November 1918 ended the war, and McNair continued to serve in the post-war occupation of Germany. In June 1919, he was named to the AEF board that was charged with studying the problem of providing adequate mobile indirect fire support to infantry during combat. This panel, called the Lassiter Board after its chairman, Major General William Lassiter, was one of several formed by the AEF to review wartime plans and activities, and make recommendations for the Army&#x27;s future equipment, doctrine, and training.

==Post-World War I==
===School of the Line===
McNair remained with the Lassiter Board only briefly because he received orders assigning him as one of the faculty members of the Army&#x27;s School of the Line. The school had ceased operations during the war and was being re-formed at Fort Leavenworth to offer professional education to field grade officers on planning and overseeing the execution of operations at division level and above. McNair reverted to his permanent rank of major, and remained on the faculty until 1921.

In addition to receiving accolades for his work to help design and field the course curriculum, McNair also played a key role in another task traditionally assigned to the School of the Line: developing and promulgating the &quot;Field Service Regulations&quot;, the Army&#x27;s main document for codifying training and readiness doctrine. While on the School of the Line&#x27;s faculty, he was one of the main authors of the 1923 revision of &quot;Field Service Regulations&quot;. The officers who were assigned to the faculty and were responsible for restarting the School of the Line after World War I all received credit for having attended the course, including McNair.

===Hawaiian Department===

In 1921, McNair was posted to Fort Shafter and assigned as assistant chief of staff for operations (G-3) at the headquarters of the Army&#x27;s Hawaiian Department. While in Hawaii, he became a participant in the Army&#x27;s ongoing debate over the best methods for providing coastal defense, which engaged proponents of the Coast Artillery branch and Army Air Service. Assigned to the project by Hawaiian Department commander Major General Charles Pelot Summerall because of his reputation for objectivity in carrying out analysis and experimentation with military weapons and equipment, McNair created a committee made up of himself, two coast artillery officers, and an aviation officer to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the two branches, especially with regard to defending Army and Navy bases on Oahu, and make recommendations on the best way to employ coast artillery and military aircraft.
The McNair board carried out numerous tests of coast artillery and bomber aircraft in a variety of conditions, and compiled tables and charts to depict the results. The panel concluded that coastal artillery was sufficient for shore defense, provided that adequate listening and lighting equipment for detecting and illuminating enemy ships and planes was available, and that bombers were less accurate, but more effective at destroying enemy ships at longer distances from shore, provided they could overcome obstacles including inclement weather.

In addition to his work on the coastal defense problem, McNair was also responsible for directing a review of War Plan Orange, the Army and Navy joint defense plan for countering an attack on Hawaii by Japan. This possibility was a major concern of U.S. military leaders during the years between World War I and World War II. Among McNair&#x27;s contributions to updating this plan was the creation of several contingency plans (&quot;branches and sequels&quot; in Army parlance) to augment the main war plan. These contingency plans included: using chemical weapons to defend against a Japanese attack, declaring martial law in Hawaii, and determining how to maintain a defense against Japanese invaders while waiting for reinforcements from the U.S. mainland.

In 1924 and 1925, McNair and Summerall defended McNair&#x27;s work when it was criticized during the continuing debate about the future of the Army Air Service. The head of the Air Service, Major General Mason Patrick, argued that the McNair board&#x27;s findings underestimated the capabilities of bomber aircraft, and that the data the board had compiled was inaccurate. In response, Major General Frank W. Coe, the chief of the Coast Artillery Corps, pointed out that McNair&#x27;s panel included both Coast Artillery and Air Service officers, and that experiments with aircraft had included coast artillery officers as observers. In addition, the aircrews that participated in the McNair board experiments had the opportunity to provide input and voice concern over the board&#x27;s methods and conclusions. Coe concluded his argument by recommending that the McNair board&#x27;s findings be approved by the Army as its official position on the issue of coastal artillery versus bombers for shore defense. Coe&#x27;s recommendation was not followed; subsequent panels and committees continued to investigate and debate the issue. In addition, the debate continued on the larger question of whether the Air Service should remain a component of the Army or become a separate branch of the military.

McNair&#x27;s involvement in the issue continued during the 1925 court-martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, whose zealous advocacy of creating a separate Air Force resulted in accusations of insubordination. Mitchell based his public assertions about non-aviation officers being ignorant of aviation matters on events he falsely claimed to have witnessed in Hawaii during the McNair board&#x27;s experiments. Summerall was so incensed at the questioning of his and McNair&#x27;s integrity that he attempted to be appointed as president of the court-martial. During Mitchell&#x27;s trial, Major General Robert Courtney Davis, the Army&#x27;s adjutant general, ordered Summerall and McNair to provide testimony. They refuted Mitchell&#x27;s claims that during his time in Hawaii in 1923 the Hawaiian Department had no plan to defend Oahu from Japanese attack. They also demonstrated that Mitchell was incorrect in stating that the Air Service was not treated fairly in the distribution of resources in Hawaii; in fact, Summerall had reallocated funding, equipment and other items from other branches to the Air Service. Mitchell was convicted, and sentenced to a five-year suspension from active duty. He resigned from the Army so he could continue to advocate for the creation of a separate Air Force. Despite the controversy, McNair&#x27;s work enhanced his reputation as an objective and innovative thinker, planner, and leader, and he remained under consideration for positions of increasing rank and responsibility.

===Purdue University===
In 1924, McNair was appointed commandant and professor of military science and tactics for the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) program at Purdue University. In accordance with the National Defense Act of 1920, ROTC offered a two-year course of instruction for freshmen and sophomores, which was compulsory at many universities, including Purdue. The program also offered advanced instruction for juniors and seniors who desired to continue military training and possibly earn a commission in the Army Reserve, National Guard, or Regular Army. In addition to following this academic model, since 1919 Purdue had organized its ROTC cadets as a motorized field artillery unit, a circumstance which played to McNair&#x27;s strengths.

Purdue&#x27;s president, Edward C. Elliott, was a strong advocate at the national level for ROTC, and a leading voice in opposition to the pacifist movement which gained strength and influence following World War I. McNair became an advocate for military preparedness generally and ROTC specifically, and also argued in opposition to the pacifists. Already a prolific author of professional journal articles on technical military subjects, he penned numerous articles and letters in favor of military training and readiness, and in opposition to the pacifist movement. He also continued to write on Army-specific subjects, including articles that argued for reforming the Army&#x27;s officer promotion system to replace seniority with merit as the primary consideration.

McNair also effected several positive changes to Purdue&#x27;s ROTC program. As outlined by Elliott, Purdue ROTC had been the subject of several rapid leadership changes which had resulted in disorganization and low morale. McNair&#x27;s leadership, technical expertise, and administrative abilities resulted in enhanced student participation and improved morale, and developed the program into the Army&#x27;s largest light artillery unit. When the Chief of Field Artillery attempted to reassign McNair to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to lead revisions to the Army&#x27;s field artillery regulations, Elliott protested; his request to keep McNair until the end of the usual four-year assignment for ROTC professors was granted, and McNair remained at Purdue until 1928.

===Army War College===
In 1928, McNair was promoted to lieutenant colonel and entered the United States Army War College, the highest-level formal education program for Army officers. In the 1920s the curriculum had been revised so that the program of instruction concentrated on economic, industrial, and logistics issues related to large-scale wartime mobilizations, as well as the doctrine, strategy, and tactics requirements associated with organizing, training, deploying, and employing large scale units for combat (typically division and above). In addition to completing seminars on staff functions (G-1 for personnel, G-2 for intelligence, G-3 for operations and training, and G-4 for logistics), McNair and his War College classmates served on committees that studied war plans and suggested improvements, reviewed regulations and proposed updates, and studied and discussed strategic-level foreign and defense policy issues to improve their understanding. Among his classmates were several officers who became prominent during World War II, including: Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr., Roy Geiger, Oscar Griswold, Clarence R. Huebner, Troy H. Middleton, and Franklin C. Sibert.

Upon graduating, McNair received an evaluation of &quot;superior&quot;, with a recommendation from the commandant that he be considered for high command or a senior position on the War Department General Staff. In addition, the commandant forwarded to the War Department McNair&#x27;s final research project on ways for the department to maximize efficiency when allocating funding for unit training, calling it &quot;a study of exceptional merit made at the War College&quot;.

===U.S. Army Field Artillery School===

After his War College graduation, McNair was assigned as assistant commandant of the Field Artillery Center and School. In this position, he worked with the school&#x27;s Gunnery Department to address field artillery doctrine issues that had lingered since World War I, including limited mobility, inadequate communications, and overly detailed fire direction techniques. Successive Gunnery Department directors Jacob Devers, Carlos Brewer, and Orlando Ward recognized that continuing improvement to innovations including machine guns and tanks made the static trench warfare of World War I unlikely to be repeated. As a result, they experimented with new techniques, including increasing the speed of artillery support to mobile armor and infantry by empowering Artillery-qualified fire support officers attached to those formations to direct artillery fire. In addition, they pioneered techniques to enhance accuracy, including forward observers (FOs) who could direct rounds onto targets based on seeing their impact, rather than the unobserved timed fire and rolling barrages that had prevailed in World War I. McNair supported these innovations, and prevented interference from senior officers who tried to block them.
Devers, Brewer, and Ward also argued for directing artillery from the battalion level rather than the battery level. In their view, massing artillery and centrally controlling it from a brigade fire direction center (FDC) enabled senior commanders to rapidly provide direct support to the areas on the battlefield where it was most needed. McNair had advocated this tactic since World War I; he again agreed with the Gunnery Department, and worked to help implement this doctrinal change while also protecting the Gunnery Department from outside interference. Over time, improvements to communications equipment and procedures and changes to doctrine enabled implementation of many of these changes, and they largely became the standard by which field artillery units conducted operations in World War II.

At the completion of McNair&#x27;s assignment as deputy commandant in 1933, he received the highest marks on his efficiency report, along with recommendations for promotion to colonel, and assignment to regimental or brigade command.

===Battalion command===
McNair commanded 2nd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment at Fort Bragg from 1 July through 1 October 1933, when organizational changes re-designated the unit as 2nd Battalion, 83rd Field Artillery Regiment. McNair commanded the renamed unit until August 1934, and led it through its renaming and reorganization.

===Civilian Conservation Corps===

In August 1934, McNair was assigned to command of Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) District E, part of the Seventh Corps Area. Headquartered at Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, District E was composed of thousands of CCC members based at 33 camps throughout Louisiana and Mississippi. As with other Regular Army officers who took part in organizing and operating the CCC, McNair&#x27;s work to plan, direct, and supervise the activities over a wide area gave him practical experience at mobilizing, housing, feeding, providing medical care for, supervising, and improving the physical and mental resilience of thousands of young members. This experience working with large bodies of men was an asset as McNair ascended into the Army&#x27;s senior ranks. In addition, McNair benefited from the experience of working with civilian government leaders to plan and direct CCC activities, which was also put to good use in his later assignments as one of the Army&#x27;s highest-level commanders. He was promoted to colonel in May 1935.

===Executive officer to the Chief of Field Artillery===

With his promotion to colonel, McNair was assigned as executive officer for the Army&#x27;s Chief of Field Artillery. In addition to carrying out the usual administrative duties of the position, such as managing the chief&#x27;s appointment calendar and handling his correspondence, McNair was able to continue experimenting with and testing field artillery equipment and weapons, including trips to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland to test the Hotchkiss Anti-Tank Gun and Hotchkiss Anti-Aircraft Gun. He also studied and authored articles on the use of autogyros for field artillery targeting and indirect fire observation, which anticipated the use of helicopters in modern warfare. In January 1937, McNair was promoted to brigadier general.

===Brigade command===
In March 1937, McNair was assigned to command of the 2nd Field Artillery Brigade, a unit of the 2nd Infantry Division, then based at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. The Army continued to experiment with equipment, weapons, and organizational design as it moved towards mechanization and modernization; the Army Chief of Staff directed tests of the triangular division concept (as opposed to the square division of World War I) through creation of a Proposed Infantry Division (PID). The 2nd Infantry Division was selected to conduct the tests, and McNair performed additional duty as the PID&#x27;s chief of staff. In this position, he managed and supervised the PID&#x27;s design, field tests, after-action reviews, and reports and recommendations to the War Department.

The triangular division model was adopted, and became the Army&#x27;s standard design for infantry divisions in World War II. In his annual performance appraisal, his division commander, Major General James K. Parsons, rated McNair as superior, and recommended him for assignment as a corps or army chief of staff. On the question of how McNair compared to his peers (unique to the appraisals of general officers), Parsons rated McNair second of the 40 generals personally known to him. McNair remained in command of the 2nd Field Artillery Brigade until March 1939, when he was appointed to serve as commandant of the Command and General Staff College.

===Command and General Staff College===

The Chief of Staff of the Army, General Malin Craig, selected McNair to command the Command and General Staff College because he believed its teaching methods needed to be updated, and that the combat unit planning and reporting processes it taught needed to be streamlined. Craig felt that McNair&#x27;s background made him ideally suited to lead this effort; in addition, Craig&#x27;s deputy, Brigadier General George Marshall, believed that the Command and General Staff College program of instruction was too rigid and too focused on a staff process geared towards leadership of Regular Army units. In Marshall&#x27;s view, the curriculum needed to be overhauled to reflect the likely needs of the World War II army, including faster, more flexible methods for planning and execution of large scale mobilizations, and incorporation of processes for training draftees and members of the National Guard, who would report for duty with less training and experience than members of the Regular Army. In addition, Marshall wanted to ensure that graduates were prepared to plan and execute the offensive maneuver-based operations Army leaders anticipated would characterize World War II, as opposed to the defensive trench warfare of World War I.

In addition to modernizing the curriculum, McNair reduced the course length to accommodate the civilian schedules of National Guard and Reserve officers, many of whom would otherwise be unable to attend. While working to update and streamline the curriculum, McNair updated the Army&#x27;s core doctrine, the &quot;Field Service Manual&quot;. He began his service as commandant in time to finalize publication of the 1939 edition, which was divided into three Field Manuals (FMs): FM 100–5, &quot;Operations&quot;; FM 100–10,
&quot;Administration&quot;; and FM 100–15, &quot;Large Units&quot;. Because of criticism of the 1939 edition, McNair almost immediately began work on an update, with Marshall, now the Army&#x27;s chief of staff, directing that it be published no later than 1 January 1941. The work on the 1941 edition was still in progress when McNair was again reassigned; when it was published it became the primary doctrinal document for the Army&#x27;s World War II activities. His efficiency reports continued to reflect his superior performance; for the first appraisal he received while commandant, Craig rated McNair second of the 41 brigadier generals he knew. In an evaluation of his performance in his additional duty as commander of the Fort Leavenworth post, Major General Percy Poe Bishop, commander of the Seventh Corps Area, ranked McNair fifth of the 31 brigadier generals he knew. By the time of his second appraisal as commandant, the War Department had waived the requirement for written evaluations of officers supervised directly by the Army Chief of Staff, but in his second role as commander of Fort Leavenworth, Bishop rated McNair as superior in all areas, recommended him for a high level command in combat, and ranked him first of the more than 30 brigadier generals Bishop knew.

==World War II==
===General Headquarters, United States Army===

In July 1940, McNair began his new assignment as chief of staff for General Headquarters, United States Army (GHQ), the organization the Army created to oversee World War II mobilization, organization, equipping, and training. Marshall was appointed to command GHQ in addition to his duties as Chief of Staff of the Army; in order to concentrate on his primary role, he largely delegated responsibility for running GHQ to McNair. As part of this working relationship, Marshall provided McNair broad advice and guidance, and McNair obtained approval from Marshall for the most important decisions. As GHQ&#x27;s responsibilities increased following U.S. entry into the war, McNair&#x27;s responsibilities were encroached upon by members of the War Department staff; for instance, the logistics staff section (G-4) retained authority over corps area commands in matters involving billeting, equipping, and supplying soldiers undergoing mobilization training, which limited GHQ&#x27;s ability to plan them and oversee their execution.

In response, McNair proposed establishing GHQ&#x27;s unity of command over the Army&#x27;s four field armies and eight corps areas; under his concept, each corps area headquarters would have responsibility for all administrative functions within their areas of responsibility, enabling GHQ and the field armies, corps, and divisions to focus on organizing, training, and administering the mobilized troop units that were preparing to go overseas. Though Marshall was initially receptive, members of the War Department General Staff disagreed with McNair&#x27;s proposal, and Marshall concurred with them.

The small GHQ staff Marshall assembled included representatives from each of the Army&#x27;s major field branches – Infantry, Field Artillery, Cavalry, Coast Artillery, Armor, Engineers, and Signal, along with liaison officers representing the National Guard and Army Reserve. As operations tempo increased, the staff expanded to include functional area representatives (G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4). Among the individuals who served on the GHQ staff were Lloyd D. Brown, who later succeeded Omar Bradley as commander of the 28th Infantry Division, and Mark W. Clark, who went on to command the 15th Army Group. McNair&#x27;s National Guard liaison was Kenneth Buchanan, who later served as assistant division commander of both the 28th and 9th Infantry Divisions, and commanded the Illinois National Guard as a major general after the war.

As GHQ chief of staff, McNair played a leading role in planning and conducting the 1940 and 1941 Louisiana Maneuvers and Carolina Maneuvers, large scale war games that enabled the Army to observe and draw conclusions with respect to training, doctrine, leadership, and other items of interest, which in turn led to changes in doctrine, equipment, and weapons. In addition, these maneuvers were used to identify which senior officers were most capable, enabling the Army to assign the best performers to command and top level staff positions, and relieve or reassign those perceived as less capable. McNair was promoted to temporary major general in September 1940, and temporary lieutenant general in June 1941.

The War Department also assigned GHQ operational responsibilities, including planning for the defenses of facilities in Iceland, Greenland, and Alaska. McNair generally delegated the responsibility for this aspect of GHQ activities to his deputy, Brigadier General Harry J. Malony, so that he could concentrate on GHQ&#x27;s organizational and training responsibilities, but maintained overall control of each role. McNair established the GHQ on the site of the Army War College (now the location of the National War College) at Washington Barracks (now Fort Lesley J. McNair), as the college had been closed for the duration of the war. McNair continued to command Army Ground Forces from this location rather than moving into the Pentagon when its construction was completed in 1943.

===Army Ground Forces===
====AGF creation and operations====
In March 1942, the Army eliminated the General Headquarters in favor of three new functional commands: Army Ground Forces (AGF), commanded by McNair; the Army Air Forces (AAF), commanded by Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold; and the Services of Supply (later the Army Service Forces or ASF), commanded by Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell. McNair&#x27;s task at AGF was to expand the Army&#x27;s ground forces from their March 1942 strength of 780,000 officers and men to more than 2.2 million by July 1943, and more than 8 million by 1945. His duties grew significantly, and included all Army boards, formal schools, training centers, and mobilization camps, as well as special activities having to do with the four combat arms (Infantry, Field Artillery, Cavalry, and Coast Artillery). As part of this reorganization, the Army eliminated the branch chief positions which had been responsible for these arms, transferring their authority to McNair. In addition, he had authority over four new &quot;quasi-arms&quot; which did not fall under the traditional combat arms – Airborne, Armor, Tank Destroyer, and Antiaircraft Artillery.

The Army intended for this reorganization to end inter-branch rivalries and competition for pre-eminence and resources; in fact it met with mixed success as advocates for each branch continued to argue among themselves. Additionally, competition for authority and resources also emerged between the War Department General Staff and the three functional commands, and between the functional commands themselves. Used to working with minimal delegation, and functioning with a small staff, McNair largely concentrated on the task at hand, and avoided the rivalries as much as possible. Despite this approach, he was still involved in controversies with the other functional commands, including an ongoing rivalry over allocation of the best qualified recruits and draftees.

====Personnel recruiting and training====
=====Training=====

McNair organized and supervised instruction in basic soldiering skills, to help individuals become proficient generalists prepared for more complex unit training. Once individuals were qualified, units carried out collective training, beginning with the lowest level, and continuing to build through successive echelons until divisions, corps, and armies were capable of carrying out large scale simulated force-against-force exercises. He insisted that training be conducted in realistic conditions, including the use of live ammunition, or simulators that replicated live ammunition, so that soldiers and commanders would be prepared to fight once they deployed overseas.

=====National Guard=====
McNair had difficulty implementing a training program for National Guard units, chiefly because of their lack of prior military experience other than monthly drills and short annual training periods. He recommended a wholesale demobilization of the National Guard; Marshall and the Secretary of War disagreed, partly because they anticipated political backlash, and partly because the manpower they provided was in demand. McNair also found National Guard senior commanders wanting; in his view, National Guard officers should not progress beyond the grade of colonel, and professional full-time officers should command at the division level and above. In this, he was mostly successful; all but two National Guard division commanders were replaced by regular Army officers, and most National Guard generals carried out stateside assignments, or non-combat overseas assignments. Some served in roles below division commander (such as assistant division commander), or carried out administrative and training roles, such as provost marshal or school commandant. In addition, some accepted reductions in rank so they could serve in overseas assignments.

=====Fielding army divisions=====
Original War Department estimates called for the Army to raise, equip, train, and deploy as many as 350 divisions. Later estimates revised this number downward to between 200 and 220. One factor that enabled this downward revision was that U.S. divisions were better equipped in some areas of their organizations than those of their adversaries, particularly later in the war; for example, every type of U.S. division was completely motorized or mechanized, while equivalent German divisions often relied on as many as 4,000 horses for transporting soldiers, supplies, and artillery. A variety of other factors, including the entry of the Soviet Union into the war on the side of the Allies after Adolf Hitler broke his non-aggression pact with Joseph Stalin by launching Operation Barbarossa, the need to ensure that enough farmers and agricultural workers were available for food production, and the need to maintain a U.S. workforce large enough to handle the production of weapons, vehicles, ammunition, and other equipment caused Army Chief of Staff Marshall to decide that maintaining the Army&#x27;s ground combat strength at 90 divisions would strike the balance between too few soldiers to defeat the Axis powers, and so many that there were not enough civilians in the U.S. workforce.

To accomplish this goal, McNair and the AGF staff created new division manning and equipping tables, which reduced the number of soldiers required to man a division. This initiative had accomplished Marshall&#x27;s goal by 1945, enabling the Army to field 89 divisions with the same number of soldiers it would have required to man only 73 divisions in 1943.

The Army&#x27;s effort to create and field a number of divisions sufficient to achieve victory also included the creation of airborne units. The Army had begun testing and experimenting with airborne formations in 1940; by 1943, William C. Lee, an early proponent of airborne forces, had convinced McNair of the need for division-sized airborne organizations. Though McNair and a few other Army leaders sometimes advocated for creation of all-purpose light divisions that could be adapted for unique missions, the Army did create some specialized divisions, including airborne. This initiative included activating the Airborne Command to oversee the organization and training of airborne units, conversion of the 82nd and 101st Infantry Divisions to airborne, and preparation of these divisions for paratrooper and glider missions in Europe.

Another initiative McNair incorporated into the effort to field the Army&#x27;s World War II division was the creation of light divisions. Recognizing that the rugged terrain of the Italian mountains and Pacific jungles required specialized units, the AGF reorganized three existing divisions as the 89th Light Division (Truck), 10th Light Division (Pack, Alpine), and 71st Light Division (Pack, Jungle). The results of pre-deployment training demonstrated that the 71st and 89th Divisions were too small to sustain themselves in combat, so they were converted back to regular infantry divisions. The 10th Division&#x27;s early training results were also less than encouraging, but its identity as a mountain division was retained, and after completing training it served in combat in the Italian mountains.

Overall, the Army&#x27;s wartime division organization and reorganizations have been judged a success by historians, in that they provided an adequate number of units to win the war, while ensuring that agricultural and industrial production could continue.

=====Individual replacement system=====
As AGF commander, McNair worked to solve the problem of how to integrate replacement soldiers into units that had sustained casualties. Rather than adopt the model of replacing units that had sustained high casualties with new, full strength units, Marshall and McNair cited the need to allocate space on transport ships to equipment and supplies as the reason to provide individual replacement soldiers to units while the units remained in combat. In practice, the individual replacement system caused difficulties for both the replacement soldiers and the units they joined, especially during later stages of the war. New soldiers could have difficulty being accepted by the veterans of their units, since they were replacing buddies who had been killed or wounded, and had not shared the veterans&#x27; combat experiences. In addition, because new soldiers joined units that were already in the fight, there was often no time to teach them the tactics and techniques that increased their chances of surviving on the battlefield.

Though soldiers were supposed to be allocated to requesting units from replacement depots based on their qualifications and the priority of the unit, McNair found that in practice many commanders in the combat theaters used replacement soldiers to form new units, or personally selected individual replacements from personnel centers without regard to their qualifications. Assigning soldiers to units for which they were not qualified, such as armor crewmen to infantry units, negated the training they had received before going overseas. To address these concerns, McNair advocated faster qualification of replacement soldiers by reducing their training from 24 weeks to 13. The War Department reduced the training requirement to 17 weeks, but mandated continued use of the individual replacement system.
Because the AGF had responsibility for implementing the individual replacement system, McNair attempted improvements, including directing the establishment of the Classification and Replacement Division within his command, and streamlining the physical, psychological, and mental criteria used to determine fitness for service. Issues with the ASF&#x27;s management of replacement centers within the United States led AGF to establish two new ones at Fort Meade, Maryland, and Fort Ord, California. Because infantry soldiers suffered disproportionately high casualties in combat, McNair argued for, but only partially succeeded in procuring recruits and draftees deemed high quality (typically those with the most education and highest aptitude test scores) for the AGF. In addition, he undertook several initiatives to improve the morale and &quot;esprit de corps&quot; of infantry soldiers, and enhance the goodwill of the civilian population towards the infantry, including creation of the Expert Infantryman Badge, and implementation of the &quot;Soldier for a Day Initiative&quot;, which gave civilian government and business leaders the opportunity to interact with mobilized soldiers before they left the United States for combat assignments.

These initiatives were not always successful; by late 1944 and early 1945, the number of units fighting continuously or nearly continuously caused the replacement system to break down. As a result, rear echelon soldiers were often pulled from their duties to fill vacancies in front line combat units, and training for some replacement soldiers and units was cut short so they could be rushed into combat. Some units were worn down to the point of combat ineffectiveness. In others, low morale, fatigue, and sickness became more prevalent.

=====Recruitment efforts=====

Because of the difficulty in attracting to the AGF those trainees deemed to be &quot;high-quality&quot;, McNair attempted to recruit through improved public relations. One part of this effort was the creation of an office attached to the AGF staff, the Special Information Section (SIS). Approximately 12 officers and enlisted soldiers with experience as writers and editors worked in the SIS to promote improved public appreciation for AGF soldiers, especially the infantry. In addition, the SIS worked with civilian writers and editors, musicians, cartoonists, film makers, and artists who worked in other mediums to enhance the prominence of infantrymen in their work. As part of this initiative, McNair wrote personally to several leading magazine and newspaper publishers to ask for their aid.

In another effort to inform the public of the Army&#x27;s personnel needs and improve the way the AGF was perceived, on Armistice Day in November 1942, McNair delivered a radio address over the Blue Network. In his remarks, titled &quot;The Struggle is for Survival&quot;, McNair described the fighting capability and ruthless attitude of soldiers in the Japanese and German armies, and stated that only similar qualities in American ground troops – by implication, meaning not &quot;the more genteel forms of warfare&quot; practiced by the AAF and ASF – would see the Allies through to victory. The public response to McNair&#x27;s remarks was largely favorable, though he did receive some criticism for extreme language that seemed to suggest an unfeeling attitude towards death and destruction. More importantly, McNair&#x27;s radio address did little to improve recruiting into the Army Ground Forces; the public may have developed a better appreciation for infantry, armor, and artillery, but volunteers and draftees continued to be attracted to the AAF and ASF, and the AAF and ASF continued to lobby for the bulk of new service members in the high quality category to be assigned to them.

=====African-American soldiers=====
During World War II, War Department regulations for African Americans required that they be admitted into the Army in numbers proportionate to their share of the population. In addition, the Army was required to establish segregated African American units in each major branch of the service, and give qualified African Americans the opportunity to earn officer commissions. The AGF worked to reconcile these requirements with its mission of producing trained soldiers and units that were capable of meeting and defeating the enemy in battle. To that end, the AGF activated and trained African American units in all major branches of the ground forces, and black soldiers who graduated from officer candidate schools (OCS) were assigned to African American units as they received their commissions. At the peak of the Army&#x27;s expansion in June 1943, there were nearly 170,000 African Americans training at AGF facilities, or about 10.5 percent of its personnel strength. These figures were in line with the War Department requirements; at the time, African Americans accounted for between 10 and 11 percent of the U.S. population.
Beginning with a small number of African American units in the Regular Army and National Guard, the AGF organized and trained many more, including the African-American 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions, and the 2nd Cavalry Division. By 1943, the AGF had created nearly 300 African American units, including the 452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion, the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, and the 761st Tank Battalion.

The War Department General Staff initially suggested incorporating African Americans into units with white soldiers at a ratio of 1 black to 10.6 whites. Based on difficulties with completing training, in large part because the abilities of the recruits were lagging as a result of having grown up in the segregated education system and culture then prevalent in the United States, McNair advocated for separate battalions of African American soldiers, arguing that they could be more effectively employed in this manner. In McNair&#x27;s construct, such units could be deployed for functions including guarding lines of communication in rear areas and near front lines, or maintained as a reserve by division and corps commanders and committed where they were most needed during combat. The proposal that was adopted was closer to what McNair had advocated, and the AGF lengthened the initial training period. African American officers generally filled company grade positions as they completed OCS, with white officers holding the field grade and senior command positions. In cases where there were not enough African Americans, white officers filled the company grade positions as well.

====Anti-tank weapons and doctrine====

Developing and employing anti-tank weapons and creating suitable doctrine proved to be an ongoing challenge, for which some historians have faulted McNair. Marshall favored creation of self-propelled anti-tank weapons; McNair had long favored towed weapons, including the M3 gun. McNair recognized the limitations of the anti-tank weapons then available, and favored a defensive approach for their use, advocating that units emplace and camouflage them, but official doctrine called for a more offensive mindset. It also called for anti-tank units to conduct independent operations; McNair favored a combined arms approach. He believed the use of anti-tank weapons was an economical and efficient means to defeat enemy tanks, and would free up U.S. tanks for wider offensive operations.

When the M3 anti-tank gun proved to be a less than optimum anti-tank weapon, the Army began development of tank destroyers – self-propelled tracked vehicles with a gun capable of engaging a tank, but which were faster and more maneuverable because they had thinner armor than a tank. When it appeared that the Infantry and Cavalry branch chiefs might subsume proposed tank destroyer units into their own task organizations, Marshall attempted to continue progress on tank destroyer development without generating active dissent by approving creation of the Tank Destroyer Center at Camp Hood. In practice, the separate Tank Destroyer Center meant that commanders of armor and infantry units had little or no experience with anti-tank weapons, or the most effective way to employ them.
After having initially fielded the anti-tank weapon it had available – the M3 towed gun – the Army began to field self-propelled anti-tank weapons, first the M3 Gun Motor Carriage, and then the M10 tank destroyer. As a result of the Army&#x27;s inability to resolve the questions of equipment and doctrine, it continued to struggle with efforts to develop viable anti-tank doctrine, and efforts to employ anti-tank guns or tank destroyers as part of combined arms team often proved ineffective.

The ongoing debate within the Army about which type of anti-tank or tank destroyer weapon to use, and what design specifications ought to be included, also hampered the AGF&#x27;s abilities to field the weapons and provide adequate training. As a result, during their initial employment and use, AGF observers in combat theaters identified several issues, including some as basic as training ammunition for the M3 Gun Motor Carriage being used unknowingly during combat, which obviously limited its effectiveness. Over time, commanders in combat resorted to field expedient measures to solve the problems, including learning to employ anti-tank guns and later tank destroyers in mutually supporting positions, and integrating them with infantry and armor units to maximize their effectiveness as part of a combined arms effort. The AGF in turn incorporated these lessons learned into mobilization training, so that over time soldiers and units deploying for combat were making use of the most up to date doctrine and tactics.

====Tanks====

At the start of World War II, the United States fielded the M3 Lee and M4 Sherman as its primary medium tanks. After-action reports from the North African Campaign and other engagements convinced commanders including Jacob L. Devers that the U.S. needed to deploy a heavier tank with more firepower in order to counter German Tiger I and Panther tanks. During his assignment as Chief of Armor earlier in the war, Devers had rejected the M6 heavy tank for being under-powered and under-gunned for its weight and size. As a result, the Army&#x27;s Ordnance Department had overseen the creation of the T20 Medium Tank. In 1942, Devers advocated the immediate shipment of 250 T20s to the European Theater. McNair opposed this request, still convinced that smaller but heavily armed self-propelled tank destroyers could be employed faster and more effectively, especially when considering factors such as available space on cargo ships transporting weapons and equipment to Europe. The Army attempted development of an improved version of the T20, the T23, but design flaws kept it from being moved into production.

In December 1943, Devers and other commanders with tank experience succeeded in convincing George Marshall of the need for a tank with more armor and firepower than the M3 and M4. An improved prototype, the T26, was produced as the M26 Pershing, and the Army ordered 250 Pershings. McNair was opposed, stating that the M4 was adequate, and arguing that tank-on-tank battles requiring the U.S. to employ heavier tanks with bigger guns were unlikely to occur. The Pershings were fielded, but arrived in Europe too late to have an effect on the conduct of the war.

McNair&#x27;s views on the employment of tanks also factored into reorganizations of the Army&#x27;s armored divisions. The Armored Force had been created in 1940, and grew to include 16 divisions, though McNair unsuccessfully recommended reducing the number to six. The Armored Force created an armored corps headquarters in 1942, but it was deactivated at McNair&#x27;s instigation after only a few months. In addition to arguing against the need for an armored corps, McNair believed the task organization for an armored division to be too large and unwieldy, again presuming that tanks would primarily serve as an exploitation force for rapid advances and as infantry support, but were not likely to engage in tank-on-tank battles. As a result, he played a key role in downsizing the armored divisions in 1942 and 1943, with the 1943 reorganization reducing the divisions by 4,000 soldiers and between 130 and 140 tanks. The downsizing enabled the creation of separate tank battalions, which could be deployed to support infantry divisions on an as-needed basis. (The downsizing did not affect the 2nd or 3rd Armored Divisions, which maintained their &quot;heavy&quot; task organization.)

==Death and burial==

In 1943, McNair traveled to North Africa on an inspection tour of AGF troops to acquire firsthand information about the effectiveness of training and doctrine, with the goal of making improvements in AGF&#x27;s mobilization and training process. On 23 April, he was observing front line troops in action in Tunisia when he sustained fragmentation wounds to his arm and head; a company first sergeant standing nearby was killed.

McNair deployed to the European Theater in 1944; his assignment was initially undetermined, and Marshall and Dwight Eisenhower, the supreme commander in Europe, considered him for command of the Fifteenth United States Army or the fictitious First United States Army Group (FUSAG). With Lieutenant General George S. Patton, the FUSAG commander, slated to take command of the actual Third United States Army after the invasion, the Army required another commander with a recognizable name and sufficient prestige to continue the Operation Quicksilver deception that masked the actual landing sites for Operation Overlord, the Invasion of Normandy. Eisenhower requested McNair as Patton&#x27;s FUSAG successor, and Marshall approved.
In July 1944, McNair was in France to observe troops in action during Operation Cobra, and add to the FUSAG deception by making the Germans believe he was in France to exercise command. He was killed near Saint-Lô on 25 July when errant bombs of the Eighth Air Force fell on the positions of 2nd Battalion, 120th Infantry, where McNair was observing the fighting. In one of the first Allied efforts to use heavy bombers in support of ground combat troops, several planes dropped their bombs short of their targets. Over 100 U.S. soldiers were killed, and nearly 500 wounded.
McNair was buried at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Normandy, France; his funeral was kept secret to maintain the FUSAG deception, and was attended only by his aide and generals Omar Bradley, George S. Patton, Courtney Hodges, and Elwood Quesada. When the press reported his death, initial accounts indicated enemy fire had killed him; not until August did the news media report the actual circumstances. McNair is the highest-ranking military officer buried at the Normandy cemetery. Along with Frank Maxwell Andrews, Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr., and Millard Harmon, he was one of four American lieutenant generals who died in World War II. McNair&#x27;s tombstone originally indicated his rank of lieutenant general. In 1954, Buckner and he were posthumously promoted to general by an act of Congress. The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) did not upgrade McNair&#x27;s gravestone; upon being informed in 2010 that the original marker was still in place, the ABMC replaced McNair&#x27;s headstone with one that indicates the higher rank.

==Hearing loss==
While generally in excellent physical condition even as he aged, McNair began to experience hearing loss early in his career. The condition progressed, and included tinnitus, but did not interfere with his work; physical examinations indicated he had no trouble with tasks including speaking on the telephone. By the time he reached the ranks of the Army&#x27;s senior commanders, his hearing loss was severe enough that he compensated by reading lips, and by forgoing participation in events where his difficulty in hearing would pose an obstacle, such as large conferences. By the late 1930s, he worried that his hearing condition might result in his mandatory retirement for medical reasons. Instead, Marshall issued a waiver which allowed him to continue to serve. His hearing loss may have prevented him from obtaining a field command during World War II, but Marshall was unwilling to do without his abilities as an organizer and trainer.

==Legacy==
===Reputation===

McNair was held in high regard by his contemporaries, as evidenced by performance appraisals that routinely gave him the highest possible ratings. Marshall also held McNair in high esteem, as demonstrated by the fact that McNair was a top stateside commander during World War II, was considered for a top command in Europe, and was ultimately selected to command the First United States Army Group as part of a deception plan that required a general with a good reputation and high name recognition for successful execution. In addition, soon after McNair was assigned to serve as commandant of the Command and General Staff School, Marshall learned that he would become the Chief of Staff of the Army. In a letter to McNair, Marshall wrote: &quot;You at the head of Leavenworth are one of the great satisfactions I have at the moment in visualizing the responsibilities of the next couple of years.&quot; Mark W. Clark served under McNair as operations officer (G-3) at AGF Headquarters before ascending to the general officer ranks. In his autobiography, Clark referred to McNair as &quot;one of the most brilliant, selfless and devoted soldiers&quot; he had ever encountered.

McNair&#x27;s primary legacy was his role as &quot;the brains of the Army&quot;, in that his involvement in unit design (the triangular division), education (the Command and General Staff Officer Course), doctrine (updating the &quot;Field Service Manual&quot; and revising field artillery methods and procedures), weapons design and procurement (experimentation with field artillery, anti-tank weapons, and anti-aircraft weapons), and training of soldiers and units (as commander of Army Ground Forces), especially in the era between World Wars I and II, made him one of the primary architects of the Army as the United States employed it for World War II.

Another enduring McNair legacy was his training method of beginning with basic soldier skills and then building through successive echelons until large units became proficient during exercises and war games that closely simulated combat. These concepts remain the Army&#x27;s core principles for planning, executing, and overseeing individual and collective training.

===Historical debate===
McNair&#x27;s decisions and actions during World War II continue to be debated by historians, particularly the individual replacement system and the difficulties with resolving the issue of tanks versus anti-tank guns and tank destroyers.

With respect to the individual replacement program, historian Stephen Ambrose described it as inefficient, wasteful, and a contributor to unnecessary casualties. However, some recent assessments have viewed it more favorably. As one example, a 2013 essay by Robert S. Rush concluded &quot;Success results NOT from rotating organizations in and out of combat but from sustaining those organizations while in combat.&quot;

On the questions of fielding anti-tank guns and tank destroyers as the primary anti-armor weapons, and fielding light and medium tanks instead of a heavy tank capable of matching those in German armor units, historians including Mark Calhoun argue that McNair recognized the limitations of the anti-tank weapons then available, and the difficulties with providing better ones given time and production constraints, and so worked to develop a doctrine that made the best possible use of the weapons that were available. Other historians, including Steve Zaloga, argue that McNair&#x27;s opposition to development and fielding of heavy tanks represented a &quot;World War I mindset&quot; that hindered the overall performance of the US Army during World War II.

===Awards and honors===

McNair received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Purdue University in 1941 and the University of Maine in 1943. The Lesley J. McNair Bridge was a temporary structure over the Rhine River in Cologne, Germany; it stood from 1945 until it was dismantled after the erection of a permanent bridge in 1946. Washington Barracks in Washington, D.C., was renamed Fort Lesley J. McNair in 1948. Roads and buildings on several U.S. Army posts carry the name &quot;McNair&quot;, including McNair Avenue and McNair Hall (Fort Sill), McNair Road (Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall), McNair Drive (Fort Monroe), and McNair Hall (Fort Leavenworth). McNair Barracks in Berlin, Germany, was named for Lesley J. McNair. The facility was closed as a U.S. military installation in 1994, and has since been redeveloped, but retains a museum which details its use as a U.S. base. McNair Kaserne in Höchst, Germany, was also named in his honor. Home to several Army Signal Corps units, it was closed and turned over to the German government in 1992, and has since been redeveloped as residential and commercial space. Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 5263 in Lawton, Oklahoma (near the Fort Sill Artillery Center and School) is named for him.

McNair was inducted into the Fort Leavenworth Hall of Fame, which was created in 1969 and is managed by the United States Army Combined Arms Center. The Fort Leavenworth Hall of Fame honors soldiers who were stationed at Fort Leavenworth, and significantly contributed to the Army&#x27;s history, heritage, and traditions. In 2005, McNair was inducted into the U.S. Army&#x27;s Force Development Hall of Fame.

There is a collection of McNair papers at the National Archives and Records Administration. Purdue University maintains another folder of papers related to McNair&#x27;s service there.

==Family==

McNair married Clare Huster (1882–1973) of New York City on 15 June 1905. They were the parents of a son, Douglas (1907–1944).
===Clare McNair===
After McNair&#x27;s death, Clare McNair was employed by the United States Department of State to investigate working conditions for female members of the United States Foreign Service Auxiliary, the organization created to augment the Foreign Service during World War II. She traveled to several foreign locations, including North Africa, Europe, and Latin America to interview employees and observe working conditions in order to make recommendations for improvements.
===Douglas C. McNair===
Douglas Crevier McNair was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on 17 April 1907, while his father was stationed at the Watertown Arsenal. He was a 1928 graduate of West Point, and became an artillery officer after initially qualifying in the infantry branch. The younger McNair advanced through command and staff positions to become chief of staff of the 77th Infantry Division with the rank of colonel. He was killed in action on the island of Guam on 6 August 1944, only 12 days after the death of his father. He died when two other 77th Division soldiers and he became involved in a skirmish with Japanese soldiers while scouting locations for a new division command post. Douglas McNair posthumously received the Silver Star, Legion of Merit, and Purple Heart. First interred on Guam, in 1949 he was buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. The 77th Division named its temporary encampment near Agat, Guam, &quot;Camp McNair&quot; in his honor. Another Camp McNair, this one near Fujiyoshida, Japan, served as a U.S. military training facility from the late 1940s until the 1970s, and was used extensively during the Korean War. In addition, the McNair Village housing development at Fort Hood, Texas, was also named for him.

==Military awards==
Lesley McNair&#x27;s awards and decorations included:
Note: Two Distinguished Service Medals, one Purple Heart, and the World War II Victory Medal were awarded posthumously.

<doc id="1248454" wikidata="Q1018670" url="?curid=1248454" title="Four Go houses">
<text>In the history of Go in Japan, the four Go houses were four major schools of Go instituted, supported, and controlled by the state, at the beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate. (There were also many minor houses.) At roughly the same time shogi was organised into three houses. Here &quot;house&quot; implies an institution run on the recognised lines of the &quot;iemoto&quot; system common in all Japanese traditional arts. In particular, the house head had, in three of the four cases, a name handed down: Inoue Inseki, Yasui Senkaku, Hayashi Monnyu. References to these names, therefore, mean to the contemporary head of the house.

The four houses were the Honinbo, Hayashi, Inoue, and Yasui. They were originally designed to be on a par with each other, and competed in the official castle games called &quot;oshirogo&quot;.
==The houses==

===Hon&#x27;inbō===

The Hon&#x27;inbō house (本因坊家) was easily the strongest school of Go for most of its existence. It was established in 1612 and survived until 1940.

Upon the closure of the school, the title &quot;Hon&#x27;inbō&quot; came to be used for the winner of the Honinbo Tournament, which is now an annual professional Go event in Japan. It is run under the titleholder system, meaning that at any given time there is a player who can use the title Hon&#x27;inbō. It is customary for Japanese players to take a special personal name as Hon&#x27;inbō, a unique feature of this title; for example Takagawa Kaku held the title for nine years, and during this time was referred to as Hon&#x27;inbō Shukaku. Players of other nationalities by custom do not adopt a special name but do use the Hon&#x27;inbō title.

Hon&#x27;inbō Shūsai sold his title to the Japan Go Association before retiring in 1936, effectively ending the Hon&#x27;inbō line.

All three of the &quot;Go saints&quot; (or &quot;Kisei&quot;) came from this school— Dosaku, Shusaku, and Jowa (although Jowa is frequently reviled because of his machinations while trying to become &quot;Meijin&quot;). Most of the holders of the &quot;Meijin&quot; title (awarded to a player recognised by all as strongest) were also from this house. Another prominent member was Hon&#x27;inbō Shūsaku (秀策, 1829–1862), who was heir to become head of the school, but died of cholera before officially becoming Hon&#x27;inbō.

===Hayashi===
The Hayashi house (林家) was one of the four Go houses of Edo period Japan. It was in effect the junior partner in the system of Go schools, never producing a Meijin player. Always an ally of the Honinbo school, for traditional reasons, it didn&#x27;t survive to the end of the period as truly independent. Its headship went to Honinbo Shuei, and when he became also Honinbo head, it was &quot;de facto&quot; merged into the Honinbos.

From the second head onwards, the head of the house when playing was known as Hayashi Monnyū.

===Inoue===

The Inoue house (井上家) was one of the four Go houses, the state-supported schools for the game of Go in Japan during the Edo period.

The numbering of the heads of the house is that introduced by Inoue Genan Inseki, at the start of the nineteenth century, and including Nakamura Doseki for reasons of prestige. During their playing careers all the heads, apart from Doseki, were called Inoue Inseki. For reasons of convenience the retirement or posthumous names are used, in the style Inoue Genkaku Inseki with the personal part of the name interposed. Variant names abound.

===Yasui===

The Yasui house (安井家) was one of the four Schools (or Houses) of Go which were officially recognized during the Edo period of Japanese history.
Each of the four schools were founded by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1612.

The house had one Meijin, in Yasui Sanchi. It has been commented that the general style of play tended to the pragmatic, rather than the artistic way.

From 1737 to the present, the current head of the Yasui house has been known as Senkaku. The retirement or posthumous names are listed here.

==History==
The first of the four houses was the house Honinbo, founded by Honinbo Sansa. Honinbo Sansa was a Buddhist monk and had been appointed Godokoro (minister of Go) by Tokugawa Ieyasu after the unification of Japan in 1603.

==Buddhist connections==
They were also nominally Buddhist institutions, with the Honinbo and Hayashi aligned with the Nichiren sect, and the Inoue and Yasui with the Jodo Shu. All players were therefore male. Some outward forms only persisted of that connection, with the &quot;oshirogo&quot; games being played in Buddhist dress and with shaven heads; the stylish Ota Yuzo was given a waiver of the obligation since he was proud of his hair. After Honinbo Doetsu made a representation that long sleeves were troublesome for the players, a dispensation for shorter sleeves was allowed to them. At least, in theory, matters on succession in the houses were subject to the authority of the &quot;jisha bugyo&quot;, an official regulating religious establishment. Nominations as heir, typically within the &quot;iemoto&quot; system of the best disciple, who might not be a natural son but in effect adopted, were supposed to be made official. Deaths at an early age particularly affected the Honinbo house, and irregular succession could occur with the potential for scandal.

==Official status==

The official posts of Meijin and godokoro were awarded, somewhat sporadically, and brought great prestige to the house. In practice, backstairs intrigue was often brought to bear on the appointments. More creditably, since the Meijin title could only be awarded to the undisputed master player of the time, there were occasions when it was withheld from two candidates whose merit was very close (an example was Genjo and Chitoku, around 1810–1820).

==Teaching==

The mode of teaching, by apprenticeship, brought a consistent and high level of play (though some say the standard sagged in the eighteenth century). Esoteric teaching was normal, with collections of very difficult &quot;tsumego&quot; being compiled, one of which, the &quot;Igo Hatsuyōron&quot;, is still used for professional training. Prepared variations were used in top games (notably in the blood-vomiting game of Jowa and Akaboshi). Go secrets were state secrets, in effect; since the country was closed to foreigners, in the main, the only international competition was against players from the Ryukyu Islands, but those games are still cited as examples of the difference between strong amateurs and extremely strong players.

==Dissolution==
After a while, the Honinbo house (of Dosaku) emerged as the most prestigious, and the Hayashi house ran into difficulties, eventually being taken over by the Honinbo. The Meiji Restoration threw the system into disarray, but three houses survived some hard times to 1900. Honinbo Shusai arranged that the Honinbo title should become a tournament of the Nihon Kiin after his death (1939). The Yasui house died out; it is not certain whether the Inoue house theoretically continues or not, though it dropped out of the mainstream from the 1920s.

<doc id="1248459" wikidata="Q6927678" url="?curid=1248459" title="Moyhu, Victoria">
<text>Moyhu is a town in the Rural City of Wangaratta Local Government Area, Victoria, Australia. It is situated in the fertile King Valley, near the King River, which flows from the Victorian Alps and joins the Ovens River in Wangaratta.

The town is about 2.5 hours drive from Melbourne, and 25 minutes from Wangaratta, and is part of the Rural City of Wangaratta. At the 2006 census, Moyhu had a population of 536. but at the 2011 census, the population had declined to 428: 216 males and 212 females. 50.5% of the population was male and 49.5% female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 0.7% of the population, and approximately 20% of the population consisted of children aged 0–14.

==History==
Moyhu, Mayhu, Moihu from Moydow, Ireland, home of original settlers, the Farrell family. The lush 92,000 acres of the King Valley was originally taken up as a pastoral leasehold &#x27;Oxley Plains&#x27; by squatters George and William Pitt Faithfull in 1838. The principal residence was initially near Oxley. The King River Crossing between Milawa and the Myrhree Station became Moyhu in the 1860s. Changes to regulations led to the splitting of Oxley Plains Station in 1848. The partnership of the brothers was dissolved. George retained the lease for the northern half of the run, Oxley Plains. Dominick Farrell became William Pitt Faithfull&#x27;s (Goulburn NSW) appointed oversee for the southern portion, the 45,000 &#x27;Edi&#x27; pastoral run. He took over from John Moore. The homestead was situated at Black Range Creek, Moyhu South and it was known as Ten Mile Hollow, later known as &#x27;The Hollow&#x27;. Farrell purchased the freehold of what remained of the original run; with cattle, horses. buildings and 16000 sheep, in 1857 for five thousand pounds.

Moyhu was the dairy farm for Edi pastoral run, and was the preferred land for selection under the pre-emptive rights clause, albeit not granted as the principal residence was still at Edi. The earliest selector was Thomas Byrne and his family who arrived in the late 1850s and lived near Meadow Creek. Son Andrew&#x27;s property developed at Ballenvalley north of Moyhu and he donated the land for the establishment of St John of the Holy Cross Catholic Church. With the death of Dominick Farrell snr in 1866, Byrne became the most significant resident of Moyhu. He represented the district as Councillor, set up the Catholic Church, Racing Club, Butter factories, co-operative store and sponsored any club of note. The first land sales were in 1859. Farrell&#x27;s nephew Dominick arrived in 1863 and married Catherine Byrne. Through the seventies the town hosted, Thursday markets, annual horse races and a timber mill. The name of the town came from Moydow, a village in Longford, Ireland; home of the Farrell clan. The Post Office opened on 1 January 1868.

The first known school at Moyhu was a Rural School No 96 which was granted aid by the Board of Education in mid 1871. It was a bark-roof slab building. From this beginning State School 1335 Moyhu was established in January 1874, with a new building on a 2-acre site. A new building was erected in 1907, with major additions made in 1959. A surveying error made when the township was originally surveyed placed the school a mile from the township. The school became important as a group-leader in the district.

3061 Moyhu North opened in a slab building in September 1890, but closed at the end of 1891 due to low enrolments. 2464 Moyhu South was later named Edi. It opened in May 1882. In July 1888 it operated half time with 2894 Witfield North, and in 1893 with 2676 Boggy Creek. It resumed full-time in 1895. In 1902 the school was relocated to cater for rural and railway families.

During the late 19th century, Moyhu was a lively centre. There were several butter factories, and it was the venue of race meetings, dances and other social events. Victoria&#x27;s first 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) narrow-gauge railway was opened in 1899, which connected Moyhu, and other settlements along the King Valley, with the main broad-gauge line at Wangaratta.

==The town today==
Moyhu is the home of several annual events - the Easter Fair at the local primary school every Easter Monday, a Garden Expo every October, Guy Fawkes bonfire, and a popular New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration in the Lions Park. It is also a central location for popular tourist attractions in the area such as Glenrowan (the scene of Ned Kelly&#x27;s last stand) and the King Valley gourmet region.

==Sport and Recreation==

The current Moyhu Recreation Reserve on the Moyhu - Greta Road, was established in 1940 and originally had a dirt bicycle track around the perimeter of the sports oval, which also had a turf cricket wicket, which was used by the Moyhu Cricket Club, when they competed in the Wangaratta and District Cricket Association.

Moyhu Rangers were a soccer club that was active between 1925 and 1930. In 1929 the Moyhu Soccer Club won the Ledger Cup defeating Whorouly.

The Moyhu Cricket Club originally played in the Moyhu and District Cricket Association in 1910, then the Ovens and King Cricket Association, winning the 1948/49 premiership and later played in the Wangaratta and District Cricket Association and finally the Wangaratta Sunday Cricket Association (WSCA), winning the 1992/93 premiership, before folding after the WSCA went into recess after the 2002/2003 season.

In 1937, the Moyhu Golf Club held their Annual General Meeting.

The town has an Australian Rules football club since 1892 and have competed in the Ovens &amp; King Football League since 1904, with two football teams and five netball teams.

==Media==
Moyhu receives Television from the local Transmission site near Wodonga and Beechworth. However it does not receive Prime7 News like the Wodonga-Albury region does.
Prime7, WIN, Southern Cross Nine, ABC, SBS.

<text>The TIMED (Thermosphere • Ionosphere • Mesosphere • Energetics and Dynamics) mission is dedicated to study the influences that energetics and dynamics of the Sun and humans have on the least explored and understood region of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere – the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere / Ionosphere (MLTI). The mission was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on 7 December 2001 aboard a Delta II rocket launch vehicle. The project is sponsored and managed by NASA, while the spacecraft was designed and assembled by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. The mission has been extended several times, and has now collected data over an entire solar cycle, which helps in its goal to differentiate the Sun&#x27;s effects on the atmosphere from other effects. It shared its Delta II launch vehicle with the Jason-1 oceanography mission.

== Atmospheric region under study ==
The Mesosphere, Lower Thermosphere and Ionosphere (MLTI) region of the atmosphere to be studied by TIMED is located between above the Earth&#x27;s surface, where energy from solar radiation is first deposited into the atmosphere. This can have profound effects on Earth&#x27;s upper atmospheric regions, particularly during the peak of the Sun&#x27;s 11-year solar cycle when the greatest amounts of its energy are being released. Understanding these interactions is also important for our understanding of various subjects in geophysics, meteorology, aeronomy, and atmospheric science, as solar radiation is one of the primary driving forces behind atmospheric tides. Changes in the MLT can also affect modern satellite and radio telecommunications.

== Scientific instruments ==
The spacecraft payload consists of the following four main instruments:

* Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI), which scans cross track from horizon to horizon to measure the spatial and temporal variations of temperature and constituent densities in the lower thermosphere, and to determine the importance of auroral energy sources and solar extreme ultraviolet sources to the energy balance in that region.
* Solar Extreme ultraviolet Experiment (SEE), a spectrometer and a suite of photometers designed to measure the solar soft X-rays, extreme-ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet radiation that is deposited into the MLT region.
* TIMED Doppler Interferometer (TIDI), designed to globally measure the wind and temperature profiles of the MLT region.
* Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER), multichannel radiometer designed to measure heat emitted by the atmosphere over a broad altitude and spectral range, as well as global temperature profiles and sources of atmospheric cooling.

The data collected by the satellite&#x27;s instruments are made freely available to the public.

** Ground operations: US$42 million

== Satellite operations ==
TIMED experienced minor problems with attitude control when, after launch, the magnetorquers failed to slow the spacecraft&#x27;s spin as intended. An engineer installing the magnetorquers had mistakenly recorded the reverse of their actual polarities, which generated a sign error in the flight software. The problem was fixed by temporarily disabling the orbiter&#x27;s magnetic field sensor and uploading a software patch to fix the sign error. In a separate incident, another software update fixed a problem caused by faulty testing of the Sun sensors. After these corrections, the attitude control system functioned as intended.

== Kosmos 2221 conjunction ==
At approximately 06:30 UTC on 28 February 2024, TIMED passed within 10 meters of the defunct Kosmos 2221 satellite. As neither TIMED nor Kosmos 2221 can be maneuvered, the conjunction was unavoidable. LeoLabs, a satellite tracking company, had estimated a satellite collision probability of as high as 8% prior to the encounter. A collision between the two satellites, both traveling at hypervelocity speeds relative to each other, was projected to generate between 2,500 and 7,500 fragments of space debris, a figure potentially exceeding that of the 2009 satellite collision between Iridium 33 and Kosmos 2251. This close miss was particularly concerning to NASA, which highlighted the event at the 39th Space Symposium in Colorado Springs in a broader speech on NASA&#x27;s new space sustainability strategy plan.

== Scientific results ==

TIMED has improved scientific understanding of long-term trends in the upper atmosphere. The SABER instrument has collected a continuous record of water vapor and carbon dioxide levels in the stratosphere and mesosphere.

SABER is able to collect 1,500 water vapor measurements per day, a vast improvement from previous satellites and ground-based observations. SABER had a flaw in its optical filter that caused it to overestimate water vapor levels; this error was discovered and the data were corrected. Based on the corrected data, SABER found that between 2002 and 2018, water vapor levels in the lower stratosphere were increasing at an average rate of 0.25 ppmv (around 5%) per decade, and in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere, water vapor levels were increasing at an average rate of 0.1-0.2 ppmv (around 2-3%) per decade. Growth in methane levels is thought to be partially responsible for the growth in water vapor levels, as methane oxidizes into carbon dioxide and water vapor, but changes driven by the solar cycle may also be responsible.

SABER has also monitored carbon dioxide levels in the upper atmosphere. The instrument found that carbon dioxide levels in the upper atmosphere are increasing: at an altitude of , levels were rising at an average rate of 12% per decade. This rate is faster than what has been predicted by climate models, and suggests that there is more vertical mixing of than previously thought.

By collecting upper atmosphere data, TIMED assists the modeling of environmental impacts. Water vapor and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases and their growth in the upper atmosphere must be factored into climate models. Additionally, upper atmosphere water vapor contributes to ozone depletion.

<doc id="1248473" wikidata="Q1287607" url="?curid=1248473" title="Grappling hook">
<text>A grappling hook or grapnel is a device that typically has multiple hooks (known as &quot;claws&quot; or &quot;flukes&quot;) attached to a rope or cable; it is thrown, dropped, sunk, projected, or fastened directly by hand to where at least one hook may catch and hold on to objects. Generally, grappling hooks are used to temporarily secure one end of a rope. They may also be used to dredge for submerged objects.

The device was invented by the Romans in approximately 260 BC. The grappling hook was originally used in naval warfare to catch ship rigging so that it could be boarded.

==Design==
A common design has a central shaft with a hole (&quot;eye&quot;) at the shaft base to attach the rope, and three or four equally spaced hooks at the end, arranged so that at least one is likely to catch on some protuberance of the target. Some modern designs feature folding hooks to resist unwanted attachment. Most grappling hooks are thrown by hand, but some used in rescue work are propelled by compressed air (e.g., the Plumett AL-52), line thrower, mortar, or a rocket.

==Applications==
=== Military ===
Grappling hooks are used by combat engineers to breach tactical obstacles. When used as such, the grappling hook is launched in front of an obstacle and dragged backwards to detonate tripwire-fused land mines, and can be hooked on wire obstacles and pulled to set off booby traps on the wire. The rifle-launched grapnel (LGH), a single-use grappling hook placed on the end of an M4/M16 rifle, is used for this purpose. A crossbow-launched version has been produced. A grapnel can clear up to 99% of the trip-wires in a single pass. During WW2 British and German ships towed grappling hooks in the hope of snagging or damaging enemy submarines, a tactic also employed by the Japanese. Grappling hooks were used by soldiers at the D-Day landings to aid in climbing the cliffs at the Normandy beaches. Some were rocket-propelled and launched from mortars.

=== Maritime ===

As well as the grapnel anchor, grapnels are used in the removal and repair of subsea cables. Large cable layer ships drag huge grapnels across the seabed until they snag a cable.

==In popular culture==
Grappling hooks, grapple guns, and their many variants have been a staple in many video games.

<text>Norman George Lorimer Hunter (23 November 1899 – 23 February 1995) was a British writer of children&#x27;s literature. He is particularly known for creating the Professor Branestawm book series.

==Early life==
Hunter was born in Sydenham, England, on 23 November 1899. He attended Beckenham County School for Boys (later known as Beckenham and Penge Grammar School and then Langley Park School for Boys). He left school to volunteer for service in the London Irish Rifles in the First World War.

==Career==
After the war Hunter became an advertising copywriter. In the 1930s he performed as a stage magician in Bournemouth. He also wrote popular books on writing for advertising, brain-teasers and conjuring, among many other topics, but his best-known works were about the character Professor Branestawm, originally written for radio. The first book, &quot;The Incredible Adventures of Professor Branestawm&quot;, was published in hardback in 1933 with illustrations by W. Heath Robinson; the second, &quot;Professor Branestawm&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot; in 1937 with drawings by James Arnold. George Adamson illustrated the reissue of &quot;Professor Branestawm&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot; in 1966, and when Norman Hunter brought out his third book in the series in 1970 after a gap of more than thirty years, Adamson provided the illustrations. Two further Professor Branestawm titles were then published with Adamson&#x27;s drawings. Other artists were to provide illustrations for later books in the series: Gerald Rose; David Hughes; Jill McDonald, and Derek Cousins. Many of the books were reissued in Puffin Books, &quot;The Incredible Adventures of Professor Branestawm&quot; under Eleanor Graham&#x27;s editorship in 1946, and many others under Kaye Webb&#x27;s in the 1960s and 1970s.

Hunter returned to London during the Second World War and lived on a boat on the Thames. In 1949 he went to work in South Africa and stopped writing fiction. After his retirement in 1970, he once again returned to London, where Thames Television had just produced an eight-part TV series, &quot;Professor Branestawm&quot;. He continued writing in his retirement and his last book was published in 1983.

<doc id="1248476" wikidata="Q665616" url="?curid=1248476" title="Troy H. Middleton">
<text>Lieutenant General Troy Houston Middleton (12 October 1889 – 9 October 1976) was a distinguished educator and senior officer of the United States Army who served as a corps commander in the European Theatre during World War II and later as president of Louisiana State University (LSU). 

Enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1910, Middleton was first assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, where he worked as a clerk. Here he did not become an infantryman as he had hoped, but he was pressed into service playing football, a sport strongly endorsed by the army. Following two years of enlisted service, Middleton was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was given the opportunity to compete for an officer&#x27;s commission. Of the 300 individuals who were vying for a commission, 56 were selected, and four of them, including Middleton, would become general officers. As a new second lieutenant, Middleton was assigned to the 7th Infantry Regiment in Galveston, Texas, which was soon pressed into service, responding to events created by the Mexican Revolution. Middleton spent seven months doing occupation duty in the Mexican port city of Veracruz, and later was assigned to Douglas, Arizona, where his unit skirmished with some of Pancho Villa&#x27;s fighters.

Upon the entry of the United States into World War I, in April 1917, Middleton was assigned to the 4th Infantry Division, and soon saw action as a battalion commander during the Second Battle of the Marne. Three months later, following some minor support roles, his unit led the attack during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, and Middleton became a regimental commander. Because of his exceptional battlefield performance, on 14 October 1918 he was promoted to the rank of colonel, becoming, at the age of 29, the youngest officer of that rank in the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). He also received the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his exemplary service. Following World War I, Middleton served at the U.S. Army School of Infantry, the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, the U.S. Army War College, and as commandant of cadets at LSU. He retired from the army in 1937 to become dean of administration and later comptroller and acting vice president at LSU. His tenure at LSU was fraught with difficulty, as Middleton became one of the key players in helping the university recover from a major scandal where nearly a million dollars had been embezzled.

Recalled to service in early 1942, upon American entry into World War II, Middleton became CG of the 45th Infantry Division during the Sicily and Salerno battles in Italy, and then in March 1944 moved up to command the VIII Corps. His leadership in Operation Cobra during the Battle of Normandy led to the capture of the important port city of Brest, France, and for his success he was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal by General George Patton. His greatest World War II achievement, however, was in his decision to hold the important city of Bastogne, Belgium, during the Battle of the Bulge. Following this battle, and his corps&#x27; relentless push across Germany until reaching Czechoslovakia, he was recognized by both General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, and Patton as being a corps commander of extraordinary abilities. Middleton logged 480 days in combat during World War II, more than any other American general officer. Retiring from the army again in 1945, Middleton returned to LSU and in 1951 was appointed to the university presidency, a position he held for 11 years, while continuing to serve the army in numerous consultative capacities. He resided in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, until his death in 1976 and was buried in Baton Rouge National Cemetery. The library at Louisiana State University had been named for him, but in 2020, the LSU Board of Supervisors unanimously voted to remove his name due to his segregationist policies.

==Family and early life==

===Ancestry===
Troy H. Middleton was born near Georgetown, Mississippi, on 12 October 1889, the son of John Houston Middleton and Laura Catherine &quot;Kate&quot; Thompson. His paternal grandfather, Benjamin Parks Middleton, served as a private in the Mississippi Infantry for the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, and his maternal grandfather, Riden M. Thompson, was also a Confederate soldier. His great-great-grandfather, Captain Holland Middleton, served from Georgia in the American Revolutionary War. Holland Middleton was the son of William Middleton and grandson of Robert Middleton, who had extensive land interests in Charles County and Prince George&#x27;s County in Maryland. In 1678 Robert Middleton was paid for expenses incurred in fighting the Nanticoke Indians and in 1681 he was commissioned as cornet (second lieutenant) in a troop of cavalry.

===Early life===
Troy Middleton was the fifth of nine children and grew up on a 400-acre plantation in southeastern Copiah County. The plantation was virtually a self-contained community, and he had a variety of chores to do depending on the season, with sausage-stuffing being one of his favorites. The local Lick Creek and Strong River had plentiful fish that he would catch, and he loved to hunt, particularly with his 12-gauge shotgun. While his family was Episcopal by heritage, they worshiped at the Bethel Baptist Church, a few miles west of Georgetown, the only church reachable on a Sunday morning. His education was conducted at the small Bethel schoolhouse, but in the summertime he was tutored by his oldest sister Emily, who came home from Blue Mountain College to share her knowledge with her family. Having exhausted all the educational opportunities available at home, Middleton&#x27;s father asked him if he was interested in a college education. Finding this an attractive proposition, in the summer of 1904, at the age of fourteen, Middleton made the 172-mile train trip to Starkville, where he would begin his studies at Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College (Mississippi A&amp;M, later Mississippi State University).

===College at Mississippi A&amp;M===

At his young age, Middleton was required to complete a year of preparatory school before being enrolled in the four-year program at Mississippi A&amp;M. In essence he did a final year of high school while living in the dormitory and following the regimen of the students at the college. The students were treated like cadets at a military academy, marching to and from all meals, and beginning their day with the first bugle call at 5:30 a.m. While Middleton did not particularly savor the military atmosphere, he settled into the routine, and the year passed quickly. The highlight of his preparatory year came on 10 February 1905 when John Philip Sousa brought his band to A&amp;M, attracting people from around the state, and packing the 2000-seat mess hall. The train that would take the band to its next stop was held up for over an hour as the concert was extended by repeated calls for encores.

The student corps at A&amp;M was organized into a battalion, with a size of about 350 cadets during Middleton&#x27;s first year. He began as a cadet corporal, and by his junior year was appointed as the cadet sergeant major. As a senior he had the cadet rank of lieutenant colonel and was the student commander of more than 700 cadets, in two battalions. Working with the military officer in charge of the cadets, Middleton took on additional responsibilities for which he was paid $25 per month.

Middleton was involved in numerous activities during his college days, and took leadership roles in most of them. He was the vice president of A&amp;M&#x27;s Collegian Club, and president of the school&#x27;s Gun Club, being photographed on one occasion with his beloved shotgun, which he was allowed to keep in his dormitory room and use for hunting on weekends. He was the president of his junior class and during his senior year was the commandant of the select Mississippi Sabre Company, which was restricted to seniors of good social, academic and military standing. Among his favorite activities were baseball and football, and he played both sports throughout college, although he had to give up a season of baseball when he failed a chemistry course. Whether playing or spectating, the baseball and football games gave the students a chance to leave campus, and they took the train to play teams around the state.

Middleton graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the spring of 1909, and was hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point. No such opportunity presented itself, however, and at the age of 19 he was too young to take the examination for an army commission. Taking the advice of an army officer at A&amp;M, he decided to enlist in the United States Army.

==Early service in the U.S. Army==

===Enlisted service===
On 3 March 1910 Troy Middleton enlisted into the 29th Infantry Regiment at Fort Porter in Buffalo, New York. He was put to work as a company clerk, and as a private earned $15 a month, which was paid in gold until it became scarce, and was then paid in silver. Middleton tired of this desk work quickly and asked to become a soldier. While this did not happen at Fort Porter, his talents as a football player became known, and he was pressed into duty as the quarterback of the local team, which played civilian teams in the Buffalo area as well as other army teams. For the next several years Middleton would play a lot of football, a sport that was strongly endorsed by the army. After getting a commission, an officer is never returned to the same unit from which he served as an enlisted member, but Middleton became the exception because of his talents as a quarterback. Middleton felt that football provided him with the finest training he received while in the army, and he said he never met a good football player who was not also a good soldier.

===Officer&#x27;s commission===

After 27 months of service, Middleton got his first promotion, to corporal. Promotions came very slowly, and occurred only when a position was vacated by someone else getting promoted or retiring. Shortly after his promotion on 10 June 1912, Corporal Middleton was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he would have a chance to compete for an army commission. Here Middleton attended an intensive training course to prepare for the written examination required for a second lieutenant&#x27;s commission. Of the 300 civilians and enlisted men who took the exam, 56 of them passed and were commissioned. Middleton&#x27;s score was just about in the middle of the passing scores. Almost all of those passing were college graduates, coming from schools such as Harvard, Yale, Virginia Military Institute, and Stanford. Four of the 56, including Middleton, would go on to become general officers.

In addition to taking the written exam, all of the applicants had to take a horse-riding test as well. Having grown up riding horses on his family&#x27;s plantation, Middleton scored very well on this exam, and the officer in charge thought that he would want to go into the cavalry. Middleton, however, wanted to go into the infantry, leaving the officer stunned that anyone with such horsemanship skills would even consider spending his time walking.

Having passed his exam, Middleton was recommended for a commission by President Howard Taft in November 1912, but it was not until after the new president, Woodrow Wilson, was sworn in the following March, and the new congress convened, that the 56 successful candidates were confirmed by the Senate. Their appointment was back-dated to 30 November 1912. During this interim period, Middleton was transferred to Fort Crockett in Galveston, Texas, where he arrived early in 1913.

===Fort Crockett and deployment to Mexico===
In February 1913 Troy Middleton reported to Fort Crockett as a second lieutenant without a commission, being assigned to Company K of the 7th Infantry Regiment. A large part of the United States Army was rotating here in response to trouble in Mexico. In 1910 Mexico&#x27;s President Porfirio Diaz was overthrown by a reform leader, Francisco Madero, beginning the Mexican Revolution which would last for nearly a decade. Madero was supported by General Victoriano Huerta in putting down a series of revolts in 1912, but the following year was assassinated by the General, who then seized power. Though many countries recognized the Huerta government, President Woodrow Wilson would not, and he hoped to return Mexico to a constitutional government by backing Venustiano Carranza. The troops at Fort Crockett went into a waiting mode, preparing for the call from the President to take action in support of American interests.

In April 1914 the waiting for the military units ended, and American troops under the command of Brigadier General Frederick Funston were sent into Mexico. The Navy had taken the port city of Veracruz and the 7th Regiment was ordered to take part in the occupation of the city. Middleton&#x27;s landing party went in unopposed and settled into occupation duty without a shot being fired. Middleton spent a total of seven months in Mexico and returned home to Galveston in November 1914.

===Marriage===
After arriving at Fort Crockett, Middleton adapted to garrison life and attended Saturday night dances in town. At one such dance he had a navy lieutenant introduce him to Jerusha Collins, who would later become his wife. She had attended Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, and had made her debut in Galveston society in 1911. Following the death of her father, Sidney G. Collins, Jerusha had come to live with her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. John Hagemann, in Galveston. As a merchant, Hagemann was well to do. Middleton met the Hagemanns, soon becoming a regular visitor at their house while calling on Jerusha.

Following seven months in Mexico, Middleton&#x27;s return to Galveston brought a special anticipation. He had proposed to Jerusha Collins at an earlier time, and renewed the proposal upon his return. The couple was married on 6 January 1915, and this allowed them to be in New Orleans two days later with other members of Middleton&#x27;s unit for the one hundredth anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans in which the 7th Regiment had served. After a week in New Orleans, the couple returned to Galveston, and were invited to move into the Hagemann&#x27;s house, where they were given a large upstairs room.

===Fort Bliss===

When Galveston&#x27;s second major hurricane hit the Texas coastline in mid-August 1915, most of the Army units had scattered to safe locations away from the storm&#x27;s path, with a few units remaining in the secure buildings of Fort Crockett or in downtown Galveston. The Middletons chose to ride out the storm at the Hagemann house. Following the storm cleanup, in October 1915, the 7th Regiment was ordered to Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas as events in Mexico flared up again. Here they were put under the command of Brigadier General John Pershing, a highly capable officer who had skipped three ranks by being promoted from captain to brigadier general for his exceptional service during the Philippine–American War.

The Mexican Revolutionary General Pancho Villa, who had at one time been supported by the United States, felt betrayed when the Americans backed Carranza. In January 1916, Villa&#x27;s followers, known as Villistas, attacked a train and killed 16 American businessmen. Two months later Villa&#x27;s men crossed the border into the United States and attacked the town of Columbus, New Mexico, killing an additional 19 Americans. Following these attacks, General Pershing took his forces into Mexico to pursue Pancho Villa.

Preceding these events, Middleton&#x27;s 7th Regiment was sent to Camp Harry J. Jones near Douglas, Arizona to perform border security. While there, Middleton and a squad of his men were fired upon by the Villistas who unsuccessfully attacked the Mexican village of Agua Prieta, across the border from Douglas. While several of Middleton&#x27;s men were hit, no one was killed, and they all returned with the 7th Regiment back to Fort Bliss in late December 1915.

===Preparation for war===
The hunt for Pancho Villa ended unsuccessfully for the Americans. War was raging in Europe, and following several months in Mexico, Pershing was called back to Fort Bliss to begin preparing his troops for this much larger conflict. In April 1917, President Wilson requested that Congress declare war, which they did. The same month Middleton was assigned to Gettysburg National Park where the 7th Regiment would continue its training. Here, he was promoted to first lieutenant on 1 July 1916, after a little more than three and a half years as a second lieutenant. With the pending war, his promotions would become much more frequent, and in less than a year he was promoted to captain, on 15 May 1917, over a month after the American entry into World War I.

==World War I==
In preparation for its buildup in strength, the army had to train a large cadre of officers. On 10 June 1917 Middleton was assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia, as the adjutant of a reserve officer training camp. These camps were organized to take civilians and turn them into officers in ninety days, and as adjutant Middleton was responsible for directing the flow of paperwork for 2,700 officer candidates. By November 1917, his camp graduated its last class of officers, and Middleton requested to join a combat division. His request was granted and on 21 December 1917 he reported to the 4th Division at Camp Greene near Charlotte, North Carolina. Two days later, however, he received new orders to become the commander of a reserve officer training camp in Leon Springs, Texas. Here, he reported as ordered, and stayed until the mission was complete in April 1918. As he was technically on loan from the 4th Division, his request to rejoin that unit was granted, and Middleton was soon on his way to France.

Believing that the 4th Division was still at Camp Greene, Middleton wired there to find out that the unit was already on its way overseas. He caught a train for New York, and when he arrived on 28 April 1918, he found his division at Camp Mills on Long Island, living in tents and awaiting transport. Middleton was given command of the First Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment, and departed New York with his regiment aboard the &quot;Princess Matokia&quot; on 11 May in a convoy of fourteen ships. Three days out of France, a fleet of destroyers met the convoy and escorted it to the port city of Brest where they arrived on 23 May. There the division unloaded and organized for several days, subsequently loading onto a troop train to arrive at Calais on 30 May.

===Calais, Chateau Thierry and Saint-Mihiel===

The first assignment of the 4th Division was to become a reserve unit for the British, just south of Calais. The Americans gave up their Springfield Rifles for some British Enfields for which there was available ammunition. When the Germans began an offensive north of Paris, the 4th was put onto trains and sent to the Marne River, about twenty-five miles west of Chateau Thierry. Here the 4th became a reserve unit for the badly battered 42nd Division. In late July 1918, Middleton, promoted to major on 7 June, moved his First Battalion in to support the 167th Regiment of the 42nd Division. In the ensuing operation, called the Second Battle of the Marne, four days of heavy fighting took place against the Prussian Fourth Guard Division fresh from a month&#x27;s rest. While the veteran Germans fought with determination, the Americans were able to push them back about twelve miles, though at a considerable cost—more than one in four of the Americans became casualties.

When the 4th Division was relieved, they were sent to the Saint-Mihiel area, where they would undertake a small support role. Major Middleton was given the task of directing the unit&#x27;s transport, complicated by the requirement to move at night with equipment and personnel to be drawn by horse and mule. After Saint-Mihiel, the unit was moved to Verdun where hundreds of thousands of French and Germans had become casualties earlier in the war. This would become the last major engagement of the First World War for Middleton, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 17 September, shortly before the commencement of the operation, called the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.

===Meuse-Argonne Offensive===
The 4th Division, on its own for the first time in the war, was assigned a front that was one to two miles wide, sandwiched between two seasoned French divisions, about eight miles from Verdun. Lieutenant Colonel Middleton&#x27;s battalion led the attack for the Americans on 26 September 1918. That day, they covered five miles, breaking through German defenses, after which it was up to the entire 47th Infantry Regiment to hold onto the gains. Middleton then put his second-in-command in charge of the battalion when he was assigned as the executive officer of the regiment. He was in this staff position for two weeks when, on 11 October, he was given command of the 39th Infantry Regiment after commander James K. Parsons and most of his regimental staff became casualties following a gas attack. At about one o&#x27;clock in the morning, Middleton had to find his way to the 39th headquarters and prepare for battle at daybreak. Shortly before 7:30 a.m., Middleton led his new regiment into enemy-held territory using a tactic called &quot;marching fire,&quot; where all of the troops constantly fired their weapons while moving a mile through heavy woods. This compelled most of the dug-in and concealed Germans to surrender, and allowed the 4th Division to move to the edge of the Meuse River. Three days after taking command of the 39th, and two days after his twenty-ninth birthday, Middleton was promoted to colonel, becoming the youngest officer in the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) to attain that rank. He also received the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his exceptional battlefield performance. The citation for the medal reads:

On 19 October, the 4th Division was withdrawn from the battle line after 24 days of continuous contact with the enemy, the longest unbroken period of combat for any American division during the war. Middleton was now given command of his former regiment, the 47th. In early November the 4th Division relieved an African American regiment near Metz, and was preparing to chase German defenders down the Moselle River, with Middleton to lead the attack. The attack did not materialize, however, because, on 10 November, Middleton received confidential news that an armistice was imminent. The following morning a messenger brought word that there would be no more firing after 11 a.m. There was celebration throughout the ranks, but there was still much work to be done; the 4th Division would soon be assigned to Germany as an occupying force.

===Occupation of Germany===
In late November 1918 the 4th Division began a road march of more than 125 miles from the French city of Metz toward the German city of Koblenz, on the Rhine River. The final destination of Middleton&#x27;s 47th Regiment would be the town of Adenau, 35 miles due west of Koblenz. The road trip took fifteen days of moving through almost incessant rain and ended in a driving snowstorm on 15 December. Middleton rode a horse during most of each day, surveying his troops and occasionally dismounting to talk with them. The formation marched for fifty minutes of each hour, and rested for ten, with a full hour for lunch.

Once in Adenau, the regiment dispersed to many villages in the area, while Colonel Middleton stayed in a large home in Adenau where the owners continued to live as well. During the stay in Adenau, the 47th continued with its training, building a rifle range, running combat problems, and practicing lessons learned from its recent combat operations. In early March 1919, after nearly four months in Adenau, the 47th was ordered to the area of Remagen on the Rhine. On the morning of the move, Middleton had breakfast with Colonel George C. Marshall, who had come to Adenau the day before to inform Middleton of his regiment&#x27;s new orders. Marshall was the aide of General John Pershing, who by now was the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the AEF.

At Remagen the 47th Regiment was given the mission of guarding the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine River. Twenty five years later the 47th would once again guard this bridge during World War II. The regiment remained here until given orders to return home in mid-summer 1919. Before his departure from Europe, Middleton was summoned to report to the Third Army Chief of Staff in Koblenz. Here he was informed that he and other senior officers were being assigned to Camp Benning, Georgia, to form the first faculty of the Infantry School that was being established there. Middleton sailed out of Brest in mid-July, met his wife in New York, and together they traveled to Columbus, Georgia, by way of Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.

==Military schools==
For the ten years following World War I, Troy Middleton would be either an instructor or a student in the succession of military schools that Army officers attend during their careers. Middleton arrived in Columbus, Georgia with strong praise from his superiors, and would soon get his efficiency report, in which Brigadier General Benjamin Poore of the 4th Division wrote of him, The best all-around officer I have yet seen. Unspoiled by his rapid promotion from captain in July to colonel in October; and made good in every grade. He gets better results in a quiet unobtrusive way than any officer I have ever met. Has a wonderful grasp of situations and a fine sense of proportion.

===Infantry School===
Up until the World War, other branches of the Army had their own specialty schools, but the infantry did not. This situation was being amended, and Middleton would be part of that change as a new faculty member of the Infantry School at Camp Benning, about nine miles from Columbus. Middleton, whose rank had reverted to his permanent rank of captain following the war, was an instructor in the new school for his first two years at Benning, and also a member of the Infantry Board, set up for research on weapons and tactics. One of his jobs on the board was to evaluate new weapons and equipment, and at one point he tested a new semiautomatic rifle which would eventually become the M-1 rifle, the standard weapon of the infantry in World War II.
The first nine-month class of the new infantry school began in September 1919, and students were taken through a curriculum of weapons and tactics. Captain Middleton, the youngest faculty member on the school staff, was an ideal instructor, fresh with experiences from the recent war. After two years as an instructor, and a promotion to major on 1 July 1920, Middleton prevailed upon his commanders to be allowed to enroll in the advanced infantry course as a student. This ten-month course included instruction on combined arms, tactical principles and decisions, military history and economics, then ended with a written thesis. Middleton, who was one of the most junior members of his class, finished at the top of the class.

Following the advanced course, Middleton spent the summer as the senior instructor at a Reserve Officer Training Camp at Fort Logan, Colorado, then returned to Camp Benning for one more year as a member of the Infantry Board. Four years at Benning had been enough for him and he was ready to move on. After expressing his wishes to a senior officer, he was assigned to Fort Leavenworth in the summer of 1923.

===Command and General Staff School===
As one of the youngest majors in the army, Middleton found himself among officers who were ten to fifteen years his senior at the Army&#x27;s Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Students attended this ten-month school to qualify for higher commands. Here Middleton met a classmate, George Patton, who would become one of his friends. Patton had confided to Middleton that he predicted completing the course as an Honor Graduate, one who finishes in the top 25% of the nearly 200 students. His prediction came true, and he finished 14th in the class. Middleton finished 8th. With his exceptional class performance, Middleton, along with half a dozen other graduates, was invited to stay on for the next four years as an instructor at the school.

During his second year of teaching at Command and General Staff School, one of his students, Dwight D. Eisenhower, would come to his office and pump him for information, knowing that Middleton had commanded a regiment in combat in France. Eisenhower asked practical questions, and was unquestionably motivated—he finished first in his class. Nearly every officer who commanded a division in Europe during World War II attended the Command and General Staff School during Middleton&#x27;s tenure there from 1924 to 1928. There was also a point in time during World War II when every corps commander in Europe had been a student of Middleton&#x27;s.

===War College===

In 1928, his final year at Leavenworth, Middleton received orders to attend the Army War College in Washington, D.C. His year at this highest level of professional military education was very fulfilling. He spent time in the school library and the Library of Congress. He wrote his staff memorandum (equivalent to a thesis) on the subject of Army transportation. Recalling his personal experience with horses and mules in France, he recommended that motorized transport significantly replace the Army&#x27;s use of livestock. The commandant of the school commended Middleton for work of exceptional merit, and sent his ideas to the highest levels in the War Department.

==Late career==

Having spent the previous ten years in the various Army schools, Major Middleton requested a return to Camp Benning, where he and his wife still had friends. The request was approved and he was assigned as a battalion commander in the 29th Infantry Regiment there, the same unit in which he had enlisted nineteen years earlier at Fort Porter. He was at Benning for only a year when he was told he would be assigned to the General Staff at the War Department in Washington D.C., but this changed when a new requirement for career officers was brought to his attention. Officers were now expected to have an assignment with a civilian component of the Army such as the National Guard, the Reserves, or the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC). The last option appealed to Middleton the most, and he wanted to work at a school in the south. There was an opening at Louisiana State University (LSU), and this is where Middleton soon headed.

===ROTC duty at Louisiana State University===

In July 1930 Troy Middleton stopped at his new headquarters at Fort McPherson in Atlanta, then drove west with his family to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which would become the family home for many years. Major Middleton became the Commandant of cadets at LSU, along with being the professor of military science.

While at headquarters, Middleton had learned that his predecessor did not get along with Louisiana&#x27;s governor, Huey P. Long. Middleton was told a few stories about the governor that made him curious enough to call on him the day after arriving in town. While the meeting turned out to be somewhat awkward for Major Middleton, it began a friendship between the two men. Governor Long loved LSU and the cadet corps there. When Middleton mentioned to him that the cadet band had just a few dozen members, the governor saw to it that the band would grow to 250 members. Governor Long was a showman, and enjoyed parades and fanfare, and would negotiate special fares to get the cadets and band transported to athletic events across the region. Because of the governor&#x27;s dealings, LSU transformed from a third rate school in 1930 to the largest university in the south by 1936.

During Middleton&#x27;s tenure at LSU the presidency of the university changed hands from President Atkinson to President James Monroe Smith, the latter an appointee of Governor Long. Towards the end of Middleton&#x27;s fourth year on campus President Smith asked him if he would stay on for an additional year and also become Dean of Men. Middleton responded that he would accept, but it had to be cleared through the War Department. Smith&#x27;s request to the War Department for both the extension and the deanship for Middleton were approved. Toward the end of the fifth year Smith went a step further, suggesting that Middleton retire from the army and become a permanent member of the LSU staff. Middleton would not even consider retirement, but accepted a sixth year with the ROTC program. As he began his sixth year on campus, on 1 Aug 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.

Early in his final year on campus, Middleton was once again pressed by the university president to retire from the army and go to work for the college. Again, Middleton could not do that, and began looking for a suitable follow-on assignment. Not having been overseas in over sixteen years, he put in a request for duty in the Philippines. He finished his tenure at LSU in the summer of 1936, having overseen the increase in students completing the ROTC program from about 500 to over 1700 cadets.

===Philippines and retirement===

In August 1936 the Middletons made a leisurely drive to New York City where they boarded a ship for the Philippines. The trip took them 42 days and included passage through the Panama Canal with stops in Panama, San Francisco, Hawaii, and Guam. When they arrived in Hawaii, they were greeted by George Patton and his wife Bea. Patton was on duty in Honolulu and had sailed his own boat from San Diego to Hawaii, and later sailed it back to the states at the end of his tour.

Middleton was assigned as an assistant inspector general in the army headquarters in Manila. Here he listened to complaints as he travelled to various Army installations including Fort William McKinley and Corregidor. Less than six months into his Philippine tour he received a telegram from President Smith renewing his offer of a job at LSU as the dean of administration with a salary of $5,400 per year. Middleton was in the hospital undergoing testing for some heart irregularity when the telegram arrived, and he showed it to two other lieutenant colonels who were visiting him. One of them said he should take the offer, the salary being excellent. The other lieutenant colonel, Dwight Eisenhower, said he should stay in the army. Eisenhower had spent three years in Panama as an aide to General Fox Conner, who knew that the terms of the Treaty of Versailles were being ignored by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis, and who was certain another war was coming soon. Eisenhower reasoned that this was no time for an officer with Middleton&#x27;s combat experience to be getting out of the Army.

To Middleton, as a very junior lieutenant colonel, the prospect of becoming a general officer seemed very remote, and upon giving the matter more thought he ultimately decided to retire from the army. Once his decision was made, he wired President Smith at LSU advising him that he was ready to become a civilian and accept the university post. The Middletons left the Philippines in May 1937, stopping in Hong Kong, Japan, and China en route to San Francisco. Lieutenant Colonel Middleton officially retired from the army on 31 October 1937.

== Tenure at Louisiana State University ==

The first year in his new job as administrative dean at Louisiana State University (LSU) went smoothly. The Middletons had a new house built on Highland Road near the campus, and an oil field was discovered under their property, bringing them royalties that would pay for their property many times over. University enrollment began to climb in 1938 and the LSU football team had just finished three outstanding seasons under coach Bernie Moore, winning 27 of their 30 regular season games. Middleton was photographed breaking ground for a new faculty club that year, as the campus grew in many areas. All seemed to be running well when in June 1939 the campus was given a shock from which it would take many years to recover. A New Orleans newspaper ran a photo on the front page showing an LSU truck unloading building materials in suburban New Orleans, revealing an illegal operation. The ensuing investigation led to the discovery that LSU&#x27;s President Smith had embezzled nearly a million dollars from the university, using the money to cover his losses while speculating in the Chicago wheat futures market. Smith stood trial, and was sent to first Federal prison and later the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola. The LSU superintendent of grounds and buildings, George Caldwell, was also involved in the scandal and served time in Atlanta for tax evasion. Meanwhile, the state&#x27;s governor, Richard Leche, resigned, but was soon found guilty of several federal charges and sent to Atlanta to serve time.

The Board of Supervisors met in a special session at the end of June 1939 and Middleton was directed to take over the business management of the university. The school&#x27;s finances were in a state of chaos, and it would take effort and time to dig out of the mess. The dean of the Law School, Paul M. Hebert, became the acting president, and Middleton became acting vice president and comptroller. Middleton chose two accounting professors, Dr. Daniel Borth and Dr. Mack Hornbeak, to work with him, and a New York firm was hired to come in and establish sound business procedures.

Before the revelation of the illegal activities, expenditures had been routinely made on a cash basis, all of the university funding and program money was thrown into a single account, and university bond indentures had been violated. The new leadership had to advertise in Louisiana newspapers to find out to whom they owed money. The first year of dealing with the situation required 16- to 18-hour days, six days a week, and after that the process still required overtime through the year 1941. Faculty and staff members, accustomed to making purchases without bids, purchase orders or knowledge of the budget, had to be educated on the accepted business procedures on which the rest of the world operated.

While Middleton was helping LSU recover from this ordeal, he was also keeping an eye on events in Europe. In July 1940 he wrote a letter to General George Marshall asking if his services were needed by the Army as the United States was making preparations for war. Marshall replied that as much as the Army would like to have Middleton back in uniform, all the Army could do would be to place him in some training role, which would not effectively use his battle experience.

Middleton stayed at LSU until 1942, describing his days as the comptroller of LSU as long days that he would not want to relive, but after the first year he found both the work and his association with Hebert, Borth and Hornbeak to be satisfying and rewarding. He felt that during this period of time he was able to make his greatest contribution to an institution that had been very good to him in the past.

== World War II ==
Troy Middleton was out dove hunting with his son, Troy Jr., and a friend on Sunday morning, 7 December 1941. Having had a successful morning, the trio decided to take a break for lunch, then come back out and get their bag limits in the afternoon. When they arrived at home for the mid-day meal, Mrs. Middleton greeted them with the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor. This put an end to the dove hunting, and Troy Middleton began to make plans. The next day he reported to the LSU president announcing his intention to offer his services to the U.S. Army, and he sent a telegram to the War Department announcing his availability for service. Within a day or so he received a reply: he would report to active duty as a lieutenant colonel on 20 January 1942.

Middleton was assigned to a training regiment at Camp Wheeler, Georgia, where he was quickly promoted to colonel on 1 February, and oversaw the combat training of thousands of recruits. After less than two months, he was given a rapid succession of assignments, including to Camp Gordon, Georgia and Camp Blanding, Florida. While at Blanding he was called to the War Department in Washington, where he was given an assignment to be a staff officer in London, but this rapidly changed when he was called to the War College, and met a classmate from Command and General Staff School, Brigadier General Mark Clark, who told him that he was being assigned to the Forty-fifth Infantry Division at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.

=== 45th Infantry Division ===
Upon returning to Florida in early June 1942 to pick up his personal effects, Middleton received his orders for Fort Devens, and also word that he had been promoted to brigadier general. In mid-June he reported to the 45th, known as the &quot;Thunderbirds,&quot; an Army National Guard division consisting mostly of troops from Oklahoma, but also including some from Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. The commanding general of the 45th, Major General William S. Key, anticipated being replaced with an active duty officer. Though Middleton was not informed of this, in late summer 1942 Key was replaced, and Middleton was given the command of the division, along with a promotion to major general.

In the summer, the 45th did its training at Cape Cod, Massachusetts, after which Middleton was in command for winter training at Pine Camp, New York. Here the temperature dipped to −36°F and snow drifted head-high. A soldier in the division by the name of Bill Mauldin did a cartoon showing slop from the kitchen frozen in a column as it descended into the garbage can outside. Mauldin later became famous for his cartoons during World War II, and won two Pulitzer Prizes for his work. In February 1943 the training moved from Pine Camp to Camp Pickett, Virginia, for mountain training, and then to the Atlantic Coast for ship-to-shore training between Norfolk, Virginia and Solomons, Maryland. In early April, while the division was at Camp Pickett, Middleton was sent to North Africa with some of his staff to begin planning the ensuing military operation. Here he went to the headquarters of the Seventh Army commander, Lieutenant General George S. Patton, in Morocco and stayed nearly a month. Patton would command the Seventh Army in the Sicily landings during the summer, and the 45th would be the only combat-loaded division coming from the United States. With the division scheduled to sail from Norfolk on 5 June, Middleton left beforehand to complete the planning for the landing on a hostile shore, this time reporting to the II Corps headquarters of Lieutenant General Omar Bradley in Algiers, Algeria. For this operation, Bradley was subordinate to Patton, under British overall direction. By the time the division arrived in Oran, Algeria, the planning was complete, and the unit was able to run one rehearsal in western Algeria before embarking for Sicily.

=== Sicily ===
The 45th Division was under Omar Bradley&#x27;s II Corps, which in turn was subordinate to Patton&#x27;s Seventh Army. Overall command of the Sicilian invasion, called Operation Husky, was with British General Sir Harold Alexander, and the British forces were organized under the British Eighth Army commanded by General Bernard Montgomery. The 45th Division consisted of three infantry regiments, the 157th, 179th and 180th, and numerous other elements. Fighting alongside the 45th Division were the First Infantry Division, Third Infantry Division, and the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) (with the 3rd Battalion of the 504th PIR and numerous other support units attached), part of the 82nd Airborne Division.

The 45th departed Oran on 4 July 1943, with little attention paid to the fact that it was Independence Day. The six-day trip to Sicily was smooth at first, then turned fairly rough, with seasickness prevalent among the troops. The weather calmed as several troop ships rendezvoused near the town of Scoglitti, on the western side of Sicily&#x27;s south coast. At 2 a.m. on 10 July the landing craft were filled with infantrymen, and as the craft approached the shoreline, the Navy opened up with a volley of preparatory fire. The primary mission of the 45th was to capture two airfields needed for Allied aircraft. Comiso Airfield, about eleven miles from the shore, was captured in a day and was being used by American planes the next day. It took four days for the division to capture Biscari Airfield, about twelve miles inland.

The next objective of the 45th was to fight German and Italian forces en route to the north coast of Sicily. The plan was to use Highway 124, one of Sicily&#x27;s four major highways. This highway, originally in the American sector, had been usurped by Montgomery, with no word of the change of boundaries given to Middleton. Word eventually came down from Alexander that the boundaries had been changed, which meant that when the 45th reached the highway, they became frozen in place with no opportunity to advance. Middleton moved his division from the right of II Corps to the left, traveling ninety miles out of the way through back areas of the other American divisions, to get in position for the march north. On 23 July the first elements of the 45th reached the north coast of the island at Station Cerda, five miles east of Termini Imerese, taking thirteen days to move from south coast to north coast. The division then moved east along the coast, reaching its objective of Santo Stefano on 30 July. Here they were stormed by the Germans, but fought back, forcing the German rear guard out of the area by the following morning. This was the end of active fighting for the 45th in Sicily, where the division endured 1,156 casualties while taking nearly 11,000 prisoners.

The Third Infantry Division was moved in to replace the 45th, which was now ticketed for the upcoming invasion of the Italian mainland. In recalling events on Sicily in his biography, Middleton noted a strain in his relationship with General Patton. Patton felt that the Mauldin cartoons published in the division newspaper were irreverent and unsoldierly. Middleton consistently defended Mauldin, but was verbally ordered by Patton to get rid of him. When Middleton told Patton to put the order in writing, the issue was dropped. Soon thereafter, Patton slapped two soldiers who he suspected of malingering in hospitals, which brought public condemnation and loss of his command.

=== Italian mainland ===
The month of August 1943 was used by the 45th Division for some rest and planning. Seven plans for the invasion of Italy were put on the table, and three of them were adopted, of which the British had two (Operation Baytown and Operation Slapstick) and the Americans had one, called Operation Avalanche. The 45th Division would be under Major General Ernest J. Dawley&#x27;s U.S. VI Corps, within the U.S. Fifth Army commanded by Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark. The plan called for the landing of the Allied forces in the vicinity of Salerno, Italy, about 200 miles north of Sicily.

The first Allied landings on the beach occurred on 9 September, with two regiments of Middleton&#x27;s 45th Infantry Division, the 157th and 179th Infantry, landing the following day. The other regiment of the division, the 180th, would land at a different point and be held in reserve by Clark. Middleton was responsible for ten miles of beachhead between the British X Corps and the U.S. 36th Infantry Division. The German defensive positions pounded the Allies, who gained little ground in the first few days of the operation. Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, faltered and sent around a confidential memo indicating that he was contemplating taking the troops back off the beaches. Middleton, telling his staff that they were not leaving, spread around the word to his troops that it was a good time to do some hard fighting. On the morning of 14 September units of the 45th did some particularly hard fighting at a large tobacco factory, consisting of five imposing stone buildings in a somewhat circular pattern. The Germans were dug in here, and repulsed the Americans initially, but with the aid of some naval gun fire, the Germans were eventually pushed back. Clark visited the front later that day, and was convinced that his army was going to stay.

General Dwight D. Eisenhower, now the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, visited the beachhead on 17 September, observing that the battle had been won. The following day the Germans had pulled out of the area, and the 45th was able to advance to Venafro before meeting any resistance. The division was at the far right of the Fifth Army, working up the center of the Italian boot, adjacent to Montgomery&#x27;s British Eighth Army which was responsible for the eastern half of the boot. By 24 September the division had taken Oliveto and Quaglietta after some heavy fighting, and by 3 October they had taken Benevento. On 21 October the division was put into corps reserve, following almost six weeks of uninterrupted action. There was still some German resistance around Venafro, and elements of the 179th Infantry Regiment secured the town on 2 November. With this the fighting came to a large pause as Allied planners studied further action.

With the lull in the fighting, and the onset of autumn rains, coupled with endless hills and deepening mud, Middleton&#x27;s left knee, which had been uncomfortable for more than a year, was now becoming agonizing. He had hurt his right knee many years earlier playing football, but there was no immediate explanation for the pain in his left leg. Medics studied his leg, but had no answers. In late November Middleton went to the hospital in Naples, staying well into December, still without adequate diagnosis. He was able to hobble around, and did some staff work, then flew to General Eisenhower&#x27;s headquarters in North Africa. He stayed there until mid-January, when he was sent to Walter Reed Hospital back in the United States. While Middleton was at Walter Reed, General Eisenhower communicated to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he needed Middleton back overseas. Acknowledging Middleton&#x27;s difficulty with his knees, Eisenhower said, &quot;I don&#x27;t give a damn about his knees; I want his head and his heart. And I&#x27;ll take him into battle on a litter if we have to.&quot; Command of the 45th Division went to Major General William W. Eagles.

The two generals came up with a plan, and Middleton was sent to six Army installations in Tennessee, Colorado, and Washington, D.C., with a brief stopover to visit his family in Baton Rouge. Middleton would be taking command of VIII Corps in England, and was sent to the various locations to confuse the enemy about the personnel change. Accompanying him was a sergeant who had been a physical therapist in civilian life, and who would massage Middleton&#x27;s knees twice a day for the next year. When asked what staff he needed to take with him, Middleton replied that he would keep the staff that was already in place, except that for an aide he would like his old LSU friend, Mack Hornbeak, who had served with him through Sicily and Italy.

===VIII Corps===

The U.S. VIII Corps had arrived in the United Kingdom in December 1943, and was commanded by Major General Emil F. Reinhardt, who Middleton had known for many years. While he was an able commander, his lack of combat experience resulted in his being replaced by Middleton (though Reinhardt would later command a division in the European fighting). Middleton&#x27;s first stop in Europe before assuming command of VIII Corps was to confer with his friend and commander, Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower had asked Middleton about his views on making Patton the commander of an army. Middleton thought it was a good idea since Patton was such an able fighter. Eisenhower agreed, but was concerned about Patton&#x27;s propensity to embarrass the Army by things he said to the press. Following this Patton was given command of the Third Army, which was headquartered north of London during the preparation for the invasion of Normandy.

Middleton&#x27;s VIII Corps headquarters was in the town of Kidderminster about fifteen miles from Birmingham, and about 110 miles northwest of London. In order to deceive the Germans, Middleton moved his headquarters another 75 miles to the north, near Liverpool. This made it appear that the corps would move east to the English Channel for a landing near Calais, France. The ruse was effective, keeping the Germans guessing, and compelling them to split their forces among multiple locations along the French coast, instead of concentrating their forces at one probable landing point.

The VIII Corps fell under Patton&#x27;s Third Army, and trained in England from March to late May 1944. Two weeks before the invasion, the corps was pulled out of the Third Army and placed in Omar Bradley&#x27;s First Army. First Army was responsible for the D-Day landings in Normandy, and once the Allies were established on shore, Middleton was to bring his VIII Corps across. Shortly before the invasion, Middleton took his corps to Southampton where they awaited their channel crossing time.

=== Cotentin Peninsula and Operation Cobra ===
The VIII Corps sat in Southampton from D-Day, 6 June, until 11 June 1944 when it began crossing the English Channel. The corps lost only one of its Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs) to a mine during the crossing, but on it was about half of Middleton&#x27;s headquarters complement. Other than the members of the sunken LST, who would rejoin the corps ten days later, the entire corps was ashore on 12 June near Carentan, where Joe Collins&#x27; VII Corps had cleared the beach on D-Day. At this point the divisions of VIII Corps included the 82nd Airborne, 101st Airborne, 79th Infantry and 90th Infantry. The 82nd, under Major General Matthew Bunker Ridgway, performed admirably, but soon left the corps, and once in Brittany the corps would have an entirely different complement of divisions.

After VII Corps took the port city of Cherbourg, VIII Corps began moving south against German forces in the middle of the Cotentin Peninsula. The Germans had the high ground, and the fighting was further complicated by the bocage countryside—a series of farmers fields and pastures forming a latticework, with each unit separated by walls of earth up to six feet high supporting dense shrubbery and trees. The German defenders had every advantage over the Americans, whose tanks would tip up and expose their thin bottom armor as they attempted to cross the barriers. By mid July, field expedient devices were developed to equip tanks to penetrate the hedgerows and restore battlefield mobility. Such specially equipped tanks were referred to as Rhino Tank.

After breaking out of the bocage, VIII Corps was able to roll fifty miles in seven days, but it, and the remainder of Bradley&#x27;s First Army, remained bottled up on the Cotentin Peninsula. The next phase of the fight, codenamed Operation Cobra was to break out of the peninsula, and once this occurred, Patton&#x27;s Third Army would join the fight. The operation began on 24 July 1944 when American air commanders were asked to lay a carpet of bombs on the Germans to soften them up for the advancing ground forces. Poor weather curtailed the operation on the first day, but more than a thousand bombing missions were carried out the following day. Lieutenant General Lesley McNair, chief of the Army Ground Forces, came to Middleton&#x27;s headquarters to witness the bombing. Middleton warned him to stay at corps headquarters, but McNair strayed away far enough that he and other members of his party were killed when they got caught by Allied bombs. More than 600 U.S. troops were killed or wounded in this friendly fire incident when the bombs fell short of their intended target.

Despite the mishap, the bombing was effective in reducing the German resistance, and over the next few days the VIII Corps was able to move south along the coast. On 30 July they seized the town of Avranches, the gateway to Brittany and southern Normandy. Once in command of Avranches, VIII Corps then secured the bridges at Pontaubault, and in doing so, broke out of the Cotentin Peninsula and into Brittany. This brought about the planned command change, and at noon on 1 Aug 1944 Omar Bradley moved up to command the 12th Army Group, Courtney Hodges took over the First Army, and Patton&#x27;s Third Army was activated into the group along with First Army, with Middleton&#x27;s VIII Corps now falling under General Patton.

Following the breakout, Middleton found himself in a doctrinally uncomfortable situation, as the allies were now in a position to pursue the Germans. The cautious and methodical Middleton was in command of two infantry divisions and two armored divisions within his corps, and the impatient Patton could not understand why Middleton was not pursuing. In early August Patton wrote in his diary, &quot;I cannot make out why Middleton was so apathetic or dumb. I don&#x27;t know what was the matter with him.&quot; Despite his wealth of battlefield experience and years of military schooling, Middleton had only limited experience in conducting pursuit operations, and was a bit overwhelmed by them. Ultimately he allowed his armored divisions some autonomy in their operations, while using his infantry to clean up pockets of resistance en route to Brest. His estimates of enemy strength turned out to be much more accurate than those provided to him by Patton, and Patton ultimately acknowledged Middleton&#x27;s value as a corps commander by presenting him with a Distinguished Service Medal within seven weeks of calling him &quot;dumb&quot; in his diary.

=== Battle for Brest ===
After the breakout from the Cotentin Peninsula, VIII Corps followed the Brittany coast westward en route to Brest, the port of Middleton&#x27;s arrival and departure from Europe during World War I. As the corps passed St. Malo, Middleton turned his 83rd Division on the town, resulting in the capture of 14,000 Germans following a lengthy battle. Patton had already directed the corps&#x27; 6th Armored Division under Major General Bob Grow to move on to Brest while Middleton was still cleaning up in St. Malo, which fell on 17 August. Grow had arrived outside of Brest on 7 August, and met stiff resistance once there. The city, housing important German submarine pens and extensive machine facilities, was defended by three elite German divisions and several powerful 90-millimeter guns which were capable of destroying most of the armor in the 6th Armored Division. The siege of Brest required infantry, and once the 2nd Infantry Division under Major General Walter M. Robertson arrived, the armored division was released back to Patton for other operations. Also joining VIII Corps for the siege was the 8th Division commanded by Major General Donald A. Stroh and the 29th Division, a National Guard unit from Virginia, commanded by Major General Charles H. Gerhardt. Middleton also had a cavalry group and two ranger battalions commanded by Colonel Earl Rudder who later became president of Texas A&amp;M University.
The city was well organized for defense, and in the Battle for Brest Middleton&#x27;s units went about capturing it methodically. The defense of the city was under German Generalleutnant Hermann Ramcke with whom Middleton carried on a dialog during the siege. Ramcke sent Middleton a map showing where several hundred American prisoners were being held in the city, but also placed on the map a number of red crosses where the Allies knew some good bombing targets were located, such as ammunition depots. Middleton wrote back to Ramcke telling him to remove some of the bogus red crosses, or some terms of the Geneva Convention might have to be ignored. Middleton also reminded Ramcke of the Allies&#x27; superior artillery and air power.

The battle for Brest was intense and very destructive. After two weeks of constant day and night attacks, Middleton&#x27;s units forced the Germans into ever tighter positions. On 12 September, Middleton sent a letter to Ramcke offering him an opportunity to stop the bloodshed, and to surrender the city in a humane and reasonable way, with terms of surrender spelled out in the letter. Ramcke&#x27;s terse reply was simply, &quot;I must decline your proposal.&quot; Unhappy with the response, Middleton directed his soldiers to &quot;enter the fray with renewed vigor...take them apart—and get the job finished.&quot; One week later, on 19 September, the Germans surrendered to Middleton, who, with much of his staff, had 99 unbroken days of combat. In a formal ceremony, Middleton gave the city back to its mayor, and General Patton arrived to pin a Distinguished Service Medal oak leaf cluster on Middleton for outstanding conduct during the campaign in Brittany, resulting in the capture of Brest.

The Americans captured more than 36,000 Germans, and evacuated 2,000 wounded, far exceeding the estimate of 10,000 Germans given to Middleton by Patton before the operation. Ramcke was captured by troops of the 8th Division, and asked the deputy division commander for his credentials. The American general pointed to the M-1 rifles being carried by his soldiers and told Ramcke that those were his credentials. Ramcke appeared at his formal surrender clean shaven and with a well-groomed Irish setter. With plenty of reporters and photographers documenting the occasion, Ramcke commented in English that he felt like a film star. He was soon sent to a prisoner of war camp in Clinton, Mississippi. After the war he spent time in a prison camp in England, and then was sent to France where he was tried and found guilty of war crimes against French civilians during the fighting at Brest. Ramcke continued a correspondence with Middleton for 15 years following the war.

=== Move to the Ardennes ===
With western France in the hands of the Allies, in late September Middleton made a leisurely trip east across France to the Ardennes Mountains, stopping en route to visit battlefields where he had served with distinction in 1918 during the Great War. The Germans were now behind a line from west of Metz, France, through Luxembourg, and east of the Belgian cities of Bastogne, Liege and Antwerp. The Allies had outrun their supply lines and had to slow their advance to resupply.

Middleton&#x27;s VIII Corps was assigned a 50-mile front, half of which belonged to the 2nd Division and the other half to the 8th Division. The front extended from Losheim, on the German-Belgian border, to central Luxembourg. On 11 October, the 83rd Division was brought back under VIII Corps control, and another 38 miles of front in Luxembourg was added to the responsibility of the corps. The new 9th Armored Division was added to the lineup on 20 October, but put into corps reserve by Middleton. During October and into November these divisions ran deception maneuvers to confuse the Germans, and also became thoroughly familiar with the terrain so as to be able to absorb a heavy thrust from the enemy should they be attacked. However, from mid-November to early December the three well-prepared infantry divisions were all replaced by two battle-weary divisions and one green division. Both the 28th Infantry Division and the 4th Infantry Division, Middleton&#x27;s old division from World War I, had taken heavy losses in the Huertgen Forest, and were at less than 75% normal strength. The 106th Infantry Division was just entering the lineup with no combat experience. Middleton now had about 68,000 officers and men in his corps, many weary and many uninitiated, along an 88-mile front facing about 200,000 veteran German troops who were deftly moving into position under the cover of darkness.

=== Battle of the Bulge ===
Striking at 5:30 a.m. on Saturday, 16 December, the Germans achieved almost total surprise in breaking through the allied lines, beginning what is commonly called the Battle of the Bulge. The Germans launched their great attack of 1940 through the same region, with Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt in command then as he was once again in this campaign. His goal was to separate the American forces from the British and Canadian forces, and take the important port city of Antwerp. By late afternoon the Germans had 14 divisions operating in the Ardennes, but this number would swell to an estimated 25 divisions, with 600 tanks and 1,000 aircraft. The 106th Division, located in the most exposed positions along the corps line, and the 28th Division took the brunt of the attack. Middleton, headquartered in Bastogne, was awakened by a guard and could hear the guns from there. Throughout the day, the 106th was able to hold its position, but additional German units poured in during the night. Much of the 106th was on the German side of the Our River in an area known as the Schnee Eifel. The division&#x27;s commander, Major General Alan Jones, called Middleton, concerned about his two regiments east of the river. The conversation was interrupted by another call, and then resumed. At the end of the conversation Middleton told an aide that he had given his approval to have the two regiments pull back to the west side of the river. Jones, on the other hand was convinced that Middleton had directed these units to stay, and was further convinced of this based on a written order from earlier in the day, but just received. As a result of the miscommunication, the pullback did not occur, and the two regiments were ultimately surrounded with most of the men captured on 17 December. While two of the 28th Division&#x27;s regiments survived the German onslaught intact, the 110th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel Hurley Fuller, was directly in the path of the advance. On 17 December Fuller counterattacked, but his lone regiment was up against three German divisions, and when Fuller&#x27;s command post was attacked he was taken prisoner. Middleton next heard from him in April when he was released. Though the 110th Regiment was shattered, the resistance given by them and other VIII Corps units greatly slowed down the German timetable.

The city of Bastogne, Belgium was a hub of several major roads and became a prime target for the Germans, seeing its capture as necessary to their advance. Middleton was in continuous communication with Bradley at 12th Army Group headquarters in Luxembourg, and maintained that though Bastogne could soon be surrounded, it should be held. As the Germans advanced on Bastogne, both Bradley and First Army commander Hodges recognized the threat to Middleton and had him move his headquarters. He was supposed to leave Bastogne on 18 December, but spent another night there so that he could brief his relief force, the 101st Airborne Division. Not only did that division&#x27;s acting commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, show up ahead of schedule, but so did Colonel William Roberts from the 10th Armored Division Combat Command R (CCR), sent by Patton. Another welcome guest arriving later that evening was Major General Matthew Ridgway, commander of XVIII Airborne Corps, en route to his headquarters, but advised by Middleton to stay in Bastogne for the night to avoid capture by the Germans. While Middleton and his guests slept, elements of the 101st Airborne poured into Bastogne all during the night and into the following day.

Having conferred with McAuliffe at length the previous evening, Middleton left Bastogne after full daylight on 19 December, and set up headquarters in a school building in Neufchâteau, 17 miles to the southwest. For the next several days, Bastogne was defended by the 101st, along with elements of CCR and some corps artillery assets that Middleton was able to supply. McAuliffe had units scattered in towns surrounding Bastogne, which bore the brunt of attacks by the Panzer Lehr Division and Second Panzer Division. At one point on 19 December, some of McAuliffe&#x27;s units wanted to fall back, and McAuliffe concurred, calling Middleton for his approval. Middleton&#x27;s response was, &quot;we can&#x27;t hold Bastogne if we keep falling back&quot; and the units were ordered to stay.

On 20 December, VIII Corps was moved from Hodges&#x27; First Army back to Patton&#x27;s Third Army. Bastogne was being surrounded by the Germans and without adequate weather for airdrops, supplies were running low. By 22 December the Germans felt that their position around Bastogne was strong enough to send in an emissary with a note advising the Americans to surrender the city, or they would be attacked in the afternoon. McAuliffe&#x27;s famous reply, &quot;Nuts!&quot; was sent back to the German commander. The Germans did renew their attack that afternoon, but it was muted by freshly falling snow, and a stiff American response. The next morning, 23 December, was the eighth day of fighting and the first day that the sun had emerged from behind the thick fog and clouds since the beginning of the battle. The Ninth Air Force was able to send 240 aircraft over Bastogne that day, each dropping about 1200 pounds of critically needed supplies, including artillery rounds that were delivered in the morning and used against the Germans the same afternoon. Over the next three days, offensives made by the Germans were countered with responses from the Americans. In the late afternoon on 26 December the first elements of the long-awaited 4th Armored Division arrived in Bastogne, breaking the siege of the city. Hitler demanded that Bastogne be taken, but even with nine divisions in the fight, the Germans were not able to break in. With the siege broken and additional elements of the 4th Armored Division coming in, Middleton stipulated that the top priority was to get the 964 wounded troops out of Bastogne and into area hospitals. Despite the small opening to the city, it was clear by 27 December that the Germans were throwing their principal effort against Bastogne.

In response to this renewed German thrust against Bastogne, Eisenhower released two new divisions on 28 December, the 87th Infantry and the 11th Armored. These units joined the 101st Airborne Division in the corps lineup just in time for a new offensive on 30 December to shrink the bulge created in the allied line. The Americans began their attack at 7:30 that morning, which, coincidentally, was the exact time that the Germans, under General der Panzertruppen (Lieutenant General equivalent) Hasso von Manteuffel scheduled an attack of their own. The 11th Armored Division had difficulty meeting its objectives (for reasons not related to the strength of the Germans), but the 87th Division fought well in the snow, sleet and deepening cold. On 3 January the new 17th Airborne Division relieved the 11th Armored Division, and the corps stretched along a crude 15-mile line due west of Bastogne, with the 101st continuing to hold the city. For the next two weeks the corps moved steadily north in heavy, sometimes even desperate, fighting, and on 16 January they met units from First Army pushing south at Houffalize. Over the following twelve days the combined force pushed the Germans back eastward across the Our River, returning the Allied line to its original position before 16 December battle began, eliminating the bulge created in the Allied line on 16 December.

=== Push across Germany and victory ===
With the front restored to its previous boundary, Bradley summoned his Army and Corps commanders to his headquarters. He wanted Hodges&#x27; First Army to advance to the Rhine, while Patton&#x27;s Third Army would stay put until First Army reached the river. Patton was very reluctant to hold in place, and questioned the advisability to do so. Bradley explained that all available ammunition and reinforcements would go to First Army, since two armies could not be simultaneously supplied. Patton reluctantly accepted Bradley&#x27;s explanation, but after that meeting he called together his three corps commanders, Manton Eddy of XII Corps, Walton H. Walker of XX Corps, and Middleton. He asked Eddy if he could ease forward and capture Trier, Walker if he could do the same with Bitburg and Middleton if he could take Gerolstein. All three commanders agreed to this, and within a few days all three had reached their objectives. Middleton was then asked by Patton to take his corps all the way to Koblenz on the Rhine River, which he did, and VIII Corps reached the river before any units of First Army arrived.

Once the VIII Corps was at Koblenz, Patton took most of its divisions away for an operation with XII Corps further up the river at Mainz, leaving Middleton with some corps units (mostly artillery) and a single division, the 87th Infantry. Middleton asked Patton if he could take Koblenz with the 87th, eliciting a laugh from the army commander. Middleton pressed him to let him try, and with the commander&#x27;s approval he was able to take the city, which only had about 500 defenders. Most of the other German troops were on the other side of the Rhine not wanting to get trapped between the Rhine and the Moselle Rivers.

Once Koblenz was captured in mid-March 1945, VIII Corps was assigned a 25-mile front from Koblenz upstream (southeast) to beyond Boppard and the famous landmark, the Lorelei. Patton then gave Middleton the 89th Division and 76th Division for the river crossing. Middleton chose to cross the river near the Lorelei where the river was narrow, swift, and flanked by steep terrain, eliciting another laugh from Patton. Middleton knew there would be little German resistance there, and he was able to get the entire 89th across in one night using inflatable rafts, and then put a pontoon bridge in place by early morning. The 87th initially attempted to cross at Koblenz but met too much resistance there, compelling them to move further upstream closer to Boppard, where their crossing went smoothly. Within two days Middleton had all three of his divisions across the Rhine.

In late March, VIII Corps advanced eastward through Eisenach and then across the Fulda River. Here some of Middleton&#x27;s infantrymen came across the concentration camp at Ohrdruf, discovering the sickening evidence of what had transpired there. Middleton called Patton to come take a look, and Patton was joined by Bradley and Eisenhower. In his diary, Patton described the place as &quot;one of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen.&quot; This was the first Nazi concentration camp to be discovered by the United States Army, and Eisenhower cabled Marshall to get a delegation from Congress over to witness and communicate what took place there. Middleton later had officials from the town come in. While every one of them denied knowing what was happening, the mayor and his wife both committed suicide that night.

The VIII Corps continued its eastward advance well into the month of April, and was ordered to stop between Chemnitz and the Czechoslovakian border, where the corps would make contact with the Russians. The immediate problem was dealing with the prisoners of war. The Americans were almost overwhelmed by the number of Germans wanting to surrender to them, and despite orders to take no more prisoners, thousands of Germans filtered through VIII Corps lines at night, desperately trying to avoid capture by the Russians. During the last week of April, a Russian cavalry unit made contact with Middleton. While the leaders of both the Americans and the Russians exchanged luncheon invitations, the Russians were extremely reluctant to allow any Americans across the Russian line, and their American lunch guests were taken by a very circuitous route into Russian-held territory.

On 25 April 1945 Patton wrote a recommendation, citing Middleton&#x27;s &quot;outstanding tactical skill and determination,&quot; his &quot;magnificent resistance against...Von Rundstadt&#x27;s attack,&quot; and his &quot;tireless energy and unfaltering aggressiveness.&quot; With the war in Europe almost over, the disposition of the various units was being decided by higher command. Some would remain as occupation forces in Europe, some would return to the United States, and some would be sent to the Pacific theater to fight against the Japanese. The Germans formally surrendered in the American sector on 7 May 1945, and two days later Patton issued his General Order Number 98 thanking the soldiers of the Third Army, past and present, for their accomplishments. On 13 May, Middleton wrote a letter to Bradley requesting to be released from active duty, once his combat services were no longer needed. He asked to return to LSU by 1 August 1945, but also paid compliments to Bradley and others by writing, &quot;That men such as you, Ike, Joe Collins, Courtney Hodges and others have accomplished so much in this war, are available to guide the future of our Army, we cannot but feel the future is in safe hands.&quot;

Middleton was the only commander that VIII Corps had ever had in combat. He had been away from home for over 1,200 days since departing in January 1942, and had logged 480 days in combat, more time than any other American general officer during World War II. Near the end of May 1945 groups of general officers, other officers and enlisted men were sent to several major cities across the United States to appear in parades. Middleton was part of a group headed by Courtney Hodges that went to Atlanta, where he and his son reunited with his wife and daughter (his son, Lieutenant Troy Middleton Jr. had been with him in Europe) and where they were treated to a reception held by the mayor. From Atlanta the family flew to Baton Rouge where Middleton took 15 days of leave, after which he went to Washington, D.C., to meet with General Marshall. Marshall told Middleton that he could either return to Germany to be with his corps, or he could wait at home until the unit returned to the states, Middleton opting for the latter. Marshall also told Middleton that VIII Corps was being ticketed for Japan. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Middleton went back to Washington, and this time Marshall told him he doubted any more units would be sent to the Pacific. Asked if he wanted to stay in the army, Middleton&#x27;s reply was that he had retired in 1937, and he intended to be returned to retired status once he was no longer needed as a combat commander.

== Return to Louisiana State University ==

In late August 1945 Middleton returned to Louisiana State University (LSU) and reported to President Hatcher, requesting his old job as comptroller. He focused on getting things ready for thousands of soldiers who would be going back to school. Enrollments had swollen in 1945, but increased exponentially in 1946. One of Middleton&#x27;s priorities was to get housing for all of these new students, many of whom were married. With keen insights into military procurement, he was able to find a variety of types of excess housing units that the military no longer needed, providing both students and faculty with adequate housing at very low cost. He did not believe that blacks and whites should play on the same athletic teams, and wrote a letter dated 27 October 1961 to this effect to the Chancellor at The University of Texas.

=== Military advisory roles ===
Though retired from the military, Middleton was soon called to serve in a variety of advisory capacities. In April 1946 he was appointed to the Doolittle Board, set up to investigate officer-enlisted men relationships, and headed by former Air Corps General James H. Doolittle. The board made a number of recommendations, one of the more significant ones being to allow the non-commissioned officers to establish their own clubs, a recommendation supported by Bill Mauldin. Three years later Middleton was asked to serve on the Military Education Panel of the Service Academy Board to look at the curricula of the Military and Naval Academies, and the proposed Air Force Academy as well. Working for nine months on recommendations, Middleton stressed a more liberal education for the academies, and much of what he recommended was accepted.

Middleton was also asked to speak to military groups on occasion, such as for commissioning exercises at Fort Benning in 1951. As late as 1958 he was called on by the United States Military Academy to come and review the curriculum offered to the cadets, and then was called again in 1959 to do related work.

In the spring of 1951, Middleton got a call from General J. Lawton Collins, who was now the Army Chief of Staff, asking for Middleton to take an assignment on behalf of the Army. Middleton was compelled to say yes. There were allegations of wholesale honor code violations at the U. S. Military Academy in West Point, and Middleton was to serve on a committee to oversee the proceedings and make recommendations. Though personally painful to Middleton, the committee&#x27;s recommendation was to dismiss 82 cadets for cheating, including most of the members of the football team. A headline in a New Orleans newspaper wryly summarized the event as &quot;Army Football Team Severely Penalized for Illegal Passing.&quot; While this was a drastic undertaking, the committee also recommended that the same tests not be given to different groups on different days, which practice offered the cadets a big temptation to cheat. Though this was not a pleasant assignment for Middleton, he had been selected for the task because of his reputation for fairness. Though he had never attended West Point, in 1952 he was asked to serve the academy on its Board of Visitors, a position which he held for one three-year term.

=== University presidency ===
Dr. Hatcher, the President of LSU, resigned his position in February 1947 because of ill health. The search went out for a new president, and when Middleton was asked to be considered for the job, he declined, being very content with his job as comptroller. Following the search, Harold W. Stoke was brought in from the University of New Hampshire. Middleton thought Stoke had many good qualities, but he could not work well with the Board of Supervisors. Stoke was sometimes doctrinaire, and his formality when working with the board members was found to be annoying by some. While he was respected by most of the faculty, Stoke continued to have run-ins with the board members, and in December 1950 his differences with the board resulted in his tendering his resignation.

Stoke asked the board to hold a special meeting on 28 December to act on his resignation. Following the meeting, three members of the board came to Middleton&#x27;s office, and told him, &quot;The board has elected you president of the university and we are here to notify you. It is the board&#x27;s desire that you accept.&quot; Middleton was pressed to make a quick decision, and feeling confident that he could fulfill the job with no misgivings, he accepted the position. There was some backlash from the resignation of Stoke, as students and members of the community criticized the board. Nevertheless, the resignation became effective on 1 February 1951, on which day Middleton began his role as university president.

The years that Middleton was president of LSU were marked by tremendous growth, resulting in many battles over funding priorities. The four major projects being considered were a new library, enclosure of the football stadium, a new auditorium and an addition to the medical school in New Orleans. Middleton&#x27;s priorities put the library at the head of the list, and the stadium last. The Board of Supervisors, on the other hand, gave priority to the stadium, and in February 1953 voted to accept a bid for the project. After the stadium expansion had been approved, the Board of Supervisors agreed to give priority to a new library in September 1953. Within a year, the state legislature had given LSU all of the funds it asked for, about 20% more than the previous request, to be used mostly for higher staff salaries, but also including 3.6 million dollars for the new library to be built across from the Hill Memorial Library in the central part of the campus. In 1954 projections indicated that student enrollment would nearly double in the next 15 years, and in response the university entered into its most ambitious building program to date.

As the university president, Middleton was constantly involved in personnel decisions, some of them making national news. One such ordeal occurred in February 1955 when the Board of Supervisors decided that it was time for the head football coach, Gaynell Tinsley, to be relieved following a break-even record in seven years. His successor, Paul Dietzel, had a rough beginning at LSU with three losing seasons, and calls for his removal grew. Middleton supported Dietzel, however, and in his fourth season as coach the LSU Tigers not only had an undefeated season, but also won the Sugar Bowl and were declared the national champions.

A serious issue facing most southern schools in 1956 was that of desegregation. While Middleton, like most white Louisianans, was in favor of segregation, as the university president his responsibility was to uphold the laws of the state and nation. In a letter to University of Texas Chancellor Harry Ransom, Middleton detailed his efforts to keep black and white students separate and to prevent black students from participating in athletics, in spite of accepting black students into the university. He wrote, &quot;Our Negro students have made no attempt to attend social functions, participate in athletic contests, go in the swimming pool, etc. If they did, we would, for example, discontinue the operation of the swimming pool.&quot;

In April he wrote a report to the Board of Supervisors entitled &quot;LSU and Segregation.&quot; Here he outlined the history of the enrollment of blacks at LSU, which showed how resistant the university had been to such an undertaking. While there were avid segregationists who declared the federal desegregation laws would not be fulfilled, more practical minds could see the futility and extreme expense of having to create duplicate facilities, and the process of integration accelerated.

When Middleton reached the university&#x27;s mandatory retirement age of 70 in 1959, the Alumni Council adopted a resolution to have the Board of Supervisors waive the age requirement, and allow Middleton to stay on as president. This was done, and again at the end of the 1959–1960 school year he was once again declared to be essential to the university, and once again reluctantly agreed to stay for one additional year. Though it became a long year, on 1 February 1962 Middleton officially retired, and three weeks earlier 11 January was declared as &quot;Troy H. Middleton Day in Louisiana&quot; by Governor Jimmie H. Davis. LSU classes were suspended, an honor guard from the Cadet Corps was formed, and Secretary of the Army Elvis Stahr came to address the convocation, at which Middleton was given the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.

=== Retirement and death ===
Middleton was a little more than 72 years old when he retired from LSU in 1962. He was now President Emeritus, and maintained an office on campus in the David F. Boyd building. He went to this office every Wednesday morning where a staff secretary handled the typing of a large number of letters in response to his mail.

Two years after his retirement, in May 1964, Governor John J. McKeithen came to his office hoping that Middleton would accept a job on a commission that he was forming. The governor was wanting to ease the state&#x27;s growing racial tensions by creating a biracial commission composed of 21 blacks and 21 whites. The governor needed a chairman who would command respect. Middleton said he would do it for a year, beginning in 1965, but as had often happened in the past, the year stretched into five, and it was not until 1970 when the commission had reached its goals and was disbanded that Middleton was freed from this duty. Middleton&#x27;s black counterpart on the commission was Dr. Albert Dent, president of Dillard University in New Orleans, and the directors chosen to head the staff of this Commission on Human Relations, Rights, and Responsibilities were white attorney John Martzell and black attorney Jesse N. Stone. Some of the potential trouble spots where the commission was able to have a positive effect included the towns of Ferriday and Opelousas, and the commission helped to open the ranks of the Louisiana State Police to qualified blacks. The commission was disbanded in May 1970, after having effectively served its purpose, and the members each received a letter of thanks from the governor.

In January 1969 the Coordinating Council for Higher Education was authorized, and Middleton agreed to serve once again, but this time refused pressure from the governor to become the chairman. After two years, Middleton felt that the council had more than justified itself by merging redundant facilities, and disapproving projects that were wasteful of taxpayer&#x27;s money. Middleton served in this role until 1973, when he was 83 years old, and also served in a number of other capacities, but continued to hunt and fish when he could, while also enjoying his growing family.

Middleton died in Baton Rouge on 9 October 1976, three days before his 87th birthday.

== Legacy ==


In 1962, the year of Middleton&#x27;s retirement from LSU, Mississippi State University declared him the &quot;alumnus of the year&quot;. On 10 September 1966, the Louisiana Association of Broadcasters awarded Middleton a bronze plaque, honoring him as the Louisianan of the Year for his accomplishments in racial peace-keeping while chairing the Commission on Human Relations, Rights, and Responsibilities. On 24 March 1973, the Middleton Collection of Memorabilia was dedicated at LSU. Housed in the university&#x27;s library, the collection included pictures, letters, citations, awards, plaques, a uniform, riding boots, a saber and numerous other artifacts and documents. The room was maintained until 1999, when the items were cataloged and moved to the university archives in the old Hill Memorial Library.

On 3 November 1978 the LSU Board of Supervisors officially named the LSU library the &quot;Troy H. Middleton Library,&quot; 20 years after the building was first dedicated. However, in June 2020, the LSU Board of Supervisors voted to strip Middleton&#x27;s name from the library, due to his past pro-segregationist stances. A plaque and bust honoring him were also removed and placed in storage.

In Baton Rouge, a street is named Middleton Place in honor of the General; and in 1986 at Mississippi State University the Army and Air Force ROTC building was named in honor of Middleton.

When interviewed by Middleton&#x27;s biographer in 1965, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had once been a student of Middleton&#x27;s, said:

<text>Cristiano Sebastião de Lima Júnior (5 June 1979 – 5 December 2004) was a Brazilian footballer who played as a forward for Dempo, before an on-field collision in India in the Federation Cup finals, with the goalkeeper of the opposing team led to his death.

==Career==
Júnior, who was the highest-paid footballer in India, signed up for Dempo in September 2004. He had only recently moved to Dempo on a transfer from Kolkata&#x27;s East Bengal where he had formed a potent strike partnership with India&#x27;s footballer Baichung Bhutia in helping his team win the league title in the 2003-2004 season and reach the knock-out stages of the 2004 AFC Cup.

==Death==
Júnior collided with Mohun Bagan goalkeeper Subrata Pal, in the 78th minute of the Federation Cup finals. While scoring his second goal after chasing the ball into the box, he collided with the keeper, staggered away and then collapsed. Attempts to revive him were unsuccessful. The game continued after Junior was taken off the field. He was dead on arrival at Hosmat Hospital. Hospital officials said that no doctors were requested to be at the ground during the Federation Cup match. &quot;At no time, was the hospital requested to provide doctors, and no agreement or contract for doctors was made.&quot; Dempo won the Cup 2-0.
According to the autopsy performed in the Bangalore Hospital (where Junior was moved from the stadium), the footballer died because of a heart stroke. The report also added that Júnior was not injured at the moment of the arrival to the health center.

Dempo announced that they would retire Júnior&#x27;s #10 shirt. It filed a complaint of criminal negligence against Subrata Pal, Hosmat Hospital, and the Karnataka State Football Association, the local organizers. Pal was suspended for 2 months.

<doc id="1248500" wikidata="Q546000" url="?curid=1248500" title="Jacob L. Devers">
<text>Jacob Loucks Devers (; 8 September 1887 – 15 October 1979) was a United States Army general who commanded the 6th Army Group in the European Theater of World War II. He was involved in the development and adoption of numerous weapons, including the M4 Sherman and M26 Pershing tanks, the DUKW amphibious truck, the Bell H-13 Sioux helicopter, and the M16 rifle.

A graduate of the United States Military Academy, Devers was commissioned in the field artillery in 1909. During World War I, he was an instructor at the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma and the November 11 armistice ended the fighting before he received orders to go to France. He traveled to France soon afterwards, where he attended the French artillery school at Treves. Between the world wars, he was a staunch advocate of mechanization when the idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.

When World War II broke out in Europe, Devers was stationed in Panama. He was promoted to major general in October 1940 and took command of the newly-formed 9th Infantry Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, a base whose construction he oversaw. Appointed Chief of the Armored Force in August 1941, he supervised its expansion from four armored divisions to sixteen. He was an articulate proponent of the emerging tactical doctrine of combined arms and rejected the American doctrine that held that tanks were for exploitation, not for fighting other tanks. He pressed American industry to produce more powerful engines and, often against the views of his superiors, pushed the development of the M4 Sherman, a medium tank with a 75 mm gun. Not satisfied with the Sherman, he called for still more heavily armed and -armored tanks. He wanted 250 of the new M26 Pershing tanks for Operation Overlord but was overruled.

In May 1943, Devers became European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA) commander. His principal tasks were overseeing preparation of detailed plans and the buildup of men and materiel for Overlord, and supporting the Combined Bomber Offensive. He clashed with General Dwight D. Eisenhower over the diversion of ETOUSA resources to Eisenhower&#x27;s North African Theater of Operations. Eisenhower succeeded him at ETOUSA in January 1944, and Devers went to the Mediterranean as Commander North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA), and Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean Theater, to British General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. Devers was involved in the organization, planning and leadership of Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France in August 1944. He led the 6th Army Group in France and Germany through the advance to the Rhine, the German counterattack in Operation Northwind, the operations to reduce the Colmar Pocket and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. After the war, he commanded the Army Ground Forces.

==Early life and education==
Jacob Loucks Devers was born in York, Pennsylvania on 8 September 1887. His parents were Philip Devers, a watchmaker and partner in a jewelry store, and Ella Kate Loucks, a homemaker. He had two younger brothers, Frank and Phillip, and a younger sister, Catherine, known as Kitts. The Devers, of Irish and Alsatian ancestry, were strict, hardworking, and religious. The family belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, which did not believe in smoking or drinking. While providing a comfortable middle-class life for their children, the couple taught them to value dependability, integrity, and industriousness.

Growing up in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, the young Jamie Devers, as he was called by his family, enjoyed the outdoors: camping, fishing, and hunting. He played all the usual boyhood sports and made friends easily with his engaging smile and cheerful personality. In addition to his household chores, he did odd jobs around the neighborhood and worked on the farm of his maternal grandfather, Jacob Loucks. Initially, he was educated at Garfield Elementary School in York. He entered York High School in September 1901. A popular student, he was elected class president. He had an excellent academic record and earned high marks in mathematics and science. Always competitive despite being slightly built, the Devers captained the basketball team, played defensive quarterback in football, and starred in baseball.

Devers graduated from York High School in May 1905. He was accepted to Lehigh University, where he intended to study engineering, but U.S. Representative Daniel F. Lafean offered him an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He entered in June with the class of 1909. Among his classmates were George S. Patton, William Hood Simpson, and Robert L. Eichelberger, who would also become four-star generals in World War II, and John C. H. Lee, who became a three-star general. Devers&#x27; classmates considered him a &quot;puritanical&quot; man with &quot;a countercultural aversion to alcohol and tobacco&quot;. He did well in his studies and excelled in sports by playing shortstop on the Army baseball team and guard on the Army Black Knights&#x27; basketball squad. He also played polo. He graduated from West Point on 11 June 1909, ranking 39th in his class of 103, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in his chosen branch, the field artillery. There were only nine positions available, but enough of the higher-ranking cadets chose other branches that Devers secured his first preference.

==World War I==
Devers&#x27;s first posting was the 1st Battalion, 4th Mountain Artillery, based at Vancouver Barracks, Washington. That was a pack artillery unit, with its howitzers, ammunition, and equipment carried by mules. It was equipped with the obsolescent QF 2.95-inch mountain gun. Three months after Devers joined, the unit moved to Fort David A. Russell, Wyoming, where it rejoined the 2nd Battalion, which was returning from the Philippines. Devers was assigned to Battery C. Soon afterwards, First Lieutenant Lesley J. McNair became the battery commander. On 11 October 1911, Devers married Georgie Hayes Lyon of Arlington, Virginia, daughter of Frank Lyon and niece of Major LeRoy S. Lyon, his battalion commander, in a ceremony at her parents&#x27; home in Arlington, Virginia. They had met when she visited her uncle at Fort Russell.
For his next assignment in December 1912, Devers was sent back to West Point to teach mathematics. He also managed the baseball program and coached the Cadet basketball team. His players included Dwight D. Eisenhower and Omar Bradley. On 1 April 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant. That August, he was transferred to the newly activated 9th Field Artillery at Schofield Barracks, in what was then the Territory of Hawaii. His only child Frances Lyon, was born there on 20 July 1917. The 9th Field Artillery had a battalion of 4.7-inch guns and one of 155 mm guns. Medium artillery was new in the United States Army, and the 9th was its first artillery tractor-drawn regiment. Devers was given command of Battery F. 

The United States entered World War I against Germany on 6 April 1917. Devers was promoted to captain on 15 May and major on 5 August. He was posted to the School of Fire at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, on 10 December as an instructor. He received promotions to lieutenant colonel on 30 July 1918 and colonel on 24 October 1918. He became executive officer of the 9th Field Artillery Regiment, his former unit from Hawaii now at Fort Sill, on 15 October 1918. In September, he was nominated to command the 60th Field Artillery, which was ordered to move to the Western Front in France, but he never took up the post. The Armistice of 11 November 1918 ended the fighting, and the orders were canceled. A disappointed Devers instead became commanding officer of the 1st Field Artillery at Fort Sill on 5 March 1919.

In May 1919, Devers was sent on a three-month temporary duty assignment to Europe with the American Army of Occupation. He attended the French artillery school at Trèves to study guns, ammunition, equipment, and tactics used by the Allies and the Germans during the war.

==Interwar Period==

Returning to the United States, Devers began a second tour of duty at West Point by serving as Senior Field Artillery Instructor and Commander, Field Artillery Detachment. He reverted from colonel to his substantive rank of captain on taking up the appointment on 20 August 1919. He was promoted to major again on 1 July 1920. The superintendent was Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur. MacArthur fought an uphill and unpopular battle to bring the curriculum up to date, and Devers defended MacArthur and his methods although his own department was unaffected.

After five years at West Point, Devers was selected to attend the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He began his studies there on 3 September 1924 and finished as a Distinguished Graduate on 28 June 1925. He was ranked 42nd in the class of 258. He was then posted once again to Fort Sill, this time as the director the Field Artillery School&#x27;s Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929. He worked with officers such as Captain Edward H. Brooks. During his tour, Devers was credited with making a number of innovative artillery tactical and technical improvements, including advanced fire-support techniques, which was later used successfully during World War II. He remained a staunch advocate of mechanization throughout the interwar period. The idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.
In September 1929, Devers was ordered to Washington, DC, to serve on the staff of the Chief of Field Artillery. Chosen to attend the Army War College in Washington, he began his studies there on 15 August 1932 and graduated on 29 June 1933. That was followed by a one-year assignment to Fort Hoyle, Maryland, as executive officer of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade, and then as commander of the 2nd Battalion, 6th Field Artillery. After 14 years as a major, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel again on 26 February 1934. On 15 June, he was sent to Fort Myer, Virginia, near the District of Columbia, as commander of the 1st Battalion, 16th Field Artillery. The battalion was supposed to be a demonstration unit for parades and other public events, and was short of personnel because many were assigned to duty with the Civilian Conservation Corps. As a result, young regimental officers like Second Lieutenant Alexander Graham, who latter married Devers&#x27; daughter Frances, were surprised when Devers had them conduct training in the field and fire their 75 mm guns at every opportunity.

In 1936, Devers returned to the Military Academy for the third time, now as graduate manager of athletics. The superintendent was now Major General William Durward Connor, an officer renowned for his sharp tongue. Devers later recalled, &quot;A lot of people were afraid of General Connor. He called me a moron once a week&quot;. The responsibility had grown considerably since the days when Devers was a cadet. Then, there were only six varsity team sports; by 1936, there were eighteen. Despite the Great Depression, the Athletic Boards, which Devers ran, had accumulated considerable funds. His major task was the construction of new playing fields where there did not appear to be any available land. He came up with a plan to move the right of way of the West Shore Railroad. He found the railroad welcoming of the plan, as a shorter and straighter route saved them money. The new fields were completed in December 1936. He was promoted to full colonel on 1 July 1938.

==World War II==
===Emergency===
In August 1939, Devers and his wife, Georgie, boarded the Army transport , bound for the Panama Canal Zone. There was at the time a genuine fear that a hostile nation might strike at the United States with an attack on the Panama Canal and prevent the movement of ships between the Pacific and the Atlantic. The outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939 led to an escalation of fears. Reinforcements including the 5th and 13th Infantry were sent to Panama. Devers became Chief of Staff to Major General David L. Stone, and then to Daniel Van Voorhis, who replaced Stone in December. He supervised construction projects and other improvements to the Panama Canal Zone defenses.

On the recommendation of the new Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall, and with the approval of Secretary of War Henry H. Woodring, Devers was promoted over 474 other colonels to brigadier general on 1 May 1940, becoming, at age 52, the youngest brigadier general in the army. In July he was recalled to Washington from the Panama Canal Zone to assume command of the Provisional Brigade in the District of Columbia area. In September, Marshall, with the approval of new Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, named Devers Senior U.S. Army representative to the Presidential Board tasked with surveying bases in the Caribbean and Newfoundland to be leased from the British under the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. When Devers said that he could use an Air Corps officer, Marshall told him to take the one outside his door, who happened to be Lieutenant Colonel Townsend E. Griffiss.

Devers was promoted to major general on 1 October 1940 and was sent to command the newly-formed 9th Infantry Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to succeed Brigadier General Francis W. Honeycutt, who had been killed in an air crash. Devers supervised training of the 9th and managed Bragg&#x27;s huge base expansion program. Devers directed basic and advanced infantry training at Bragg for the thousands of troops under his command: regular army, national guard, reservists, and draftees. Among his colonels was Alexander M. (Sandy) Patch, the commander of the 47th Infantry. During Devers&#x27;s tour, Fort Bragg&#x27;s strength grew from 5,400 to 67,000 soldiers. Meanwhile, he pushed forward immense construction projects for base housing, training facilities and roads on the overcrowded post. By working closely and co-operatively with engineers, local contractors, quartermasters and staff and by cutting through red tape, Devers oversaw completion of 2,500 buildings and of roads in six months.

===Armored Force===
On 1 August 1941, General Marshall named Devers Chief of the Armored Force, headquartered at Fort Knox, Kentucky, replacing the terminally-ill Major General Adna R. Chaffee Jr. Devers reported directly to Marshall. He was responsible for inspecting, organizing and training the army&#x27;s armored divisions and separate non-divisional tank battalions, including all non-tank personnel assigned. McNair&#x27;s Army General Headquarters (GHQ) was in tactical charge of all U.S. ground forces, but GHQ specifically did not control the semi-autonomous Armored Force, which was considered a &quot;quasi-arm&quot;. The Armored Force had complete control of its own training, doctrine, and organization. In a major reorganization of the War Department in March 1942, McNair was named Commander of a new component, Army Ground Forces (AGF), which replaced GHQ. Relations between GHQ/AGF and the Armored Force were distant, and lines of authority and responsibility were often unclear. McNair seemed to prefer leaving Devers alone.
When Devers took command, the Armored Force had two operational armored divisions: the 1st Armored Division at Fort Polk (now Fort Johnson), Louisiana, and the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Knox, as well as one independent tank battalion, the 70th Tank Battalion at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Both divisions participated in the large-scale war games of the Louisiana Maneuvers in August and September 1941 and the Carolina Maneuvers in November 1941. Despite some successes, the maneuvers revealed armored unit and equipment operational deficiencies, as well as a general lack of combat readiness. Devers attributed much of the poor performance to poorly-trained junior and staff officers but also saw doctrinal deficiencies, which hampered the co-ordination of tanks, the infantry, and the artillery.

In particular, post-maneuver reports emphasized the vulnerability of tanks to antitank fire. That bolstered the antitank gun, which were strongly supported by McNair. Devers differed by countering that the number of tank &quot;kills&quot; credited to antitank gunners was unrealistic and biased and felt that &quot;we were licked by a set of umpires&#x27; rules&quot;. McNair continued to push for an independent tank destroyer force, but Devers argued that &quot;the weapon to best the tank is a better tank&quot;. Nevertheless, in November, Marshall authorized creation of a tank destroyer force. The Tank Destroyer Center was created, and the War Department ordered the activation of 53 tank destroyer battalions. Battlefield experience proved that Devers was correct. In combat, most tanks were knocked out by other tanks, and tank destroyers were mainly used as mobile artillery support. The tank destroyer program was scaled back, and tank destroyer battalions were deactivated. At the end of the war, the tank destroyer quasi-arm was disbanded.

Before Devers&#x27; arrival, Armored Force doctrine emphasized light tanks weighing no more than . American doctrine held that tanks were for exploitation, not fighting other tanks. He rejected the M6 heavy tank and recommended to McNair for it to be canceled, citing concerns about its weight, mobility, and reliability, which was seen as support for that position, but Devers wanted a medium tank, preferably by mounting something like a 105 mm howitzer. He was appalled to find that the Armored Force&#x27;s tanks were armed with nothing heavier than a 37 mm gun. A new medium tank had started to come off the production line, the M3 Lee. Devers observed testing of one of them just days after taking command, and he was unimpressed. American industry was unable to cast a turret large enough to hold a 75 mm gun and so the M3 carried a 37 mm gun, with a 75 mm in a sponson. That gave it a limited traverse and made it difficult to engage moving targets. To make matters worse, the designers shortened the barrel to improve the M3&#x27;s mobility, which Devers realized also reduced the gun&#x27;s muzzle velocity and hence its effectiveness against armor. In practice, M3 crews attempted to engage German armor with the 75 mm, as the 37 mm was ineffective against it. It was found that the 75 mm could penetrate the frontal armor of German tanks at , but German tanks destroyed M3s at up to . Devers pronounced the M3 &quot;overweight, underpowered, and insufficiently armed&quot;.

Often against the views of his superiors, Devers lobbied for a still more heavily armored and better-armed medium tank, the M4 Sherman. He played an important role in the M4&#x27;s design, development and manufacturing, particularly its engine and armament. Throughout his tour as Chief of the Armored Force, he worked closely with the United States Army Ordnance Department, manufacturers and the Armored Force Board at Fort Knox on the research and testing of tanks, guns, armored vehicles and ammunition. The biggest obstacle was engines. Those of prewar tanks were rated at , insufficient for a medium tank. Devers wanted an engine, but that was beyond the ability of the American automotive industry to produce. Extraordinary efforts resulted in the development of a number of engines. He controversially rejected the General Motors 6046 diesel engine in favor of a gasoline engine. Battlefield experience demonstrated that the diesel engine was superior. The quest for a better engine eventually settled on the Ford GAA engine, but there was a persistent shortage of tank engines. Some 49,234 of the reliable, versatile, low-cost M4 Sherman and its variants were produced.

After the GHQ Maneuvers, the Army expected to have a period of &quot;remedial training&quot; to fix problems. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 shattered those expectations and plunged a not fully-prepared United States into the war. In early 1942, two armored divisions were operational and three were in training: the 6th Armored Division was activated in February, followed by the 7th Armored Division in March. McNair recommended for one division in five to be an armored division, which meant up to 50 armored divisions by the end of 1943. Pressure increased on Devers, who was promoted to lieutenant general (equal in rank to McNair) on 6 September 1942, to push more armored units through the pipeline even more quickly. Training was sometimes neglected because of the pressing need to get units ready for overseas deployment. Initially, the Armored Force trained all of the components of the armored division, but after March 1942, it became restricted to tank personnel, with other personnel coming from their own branch training centers. Devers sent Patton, now commander of I Armored Corps, to set up the Desert Training Center (DTC) in the California-Arizona Mojave Desert, where soldiers could train for desert warfare. When it closed in 1944, 20 infantry and armored divisions had trained there; although none fought in the desert, and five of them were sent to the Pacific.

Devers was an articulate proponent of the Army&#x27;s now-emerging tactical doctrine of combined arms: infantry-artillery-armor-close air support. He carried a translation of a German manual on the components of the Panzer division. Devers was neither the first nor the only general to embrace combined arms as the doctrinal solution to the problem of how best to employ tanks, but he was well-placed to act upon it. At his direction, an updated comprehensive (460 pages) &quot;Armed Force Field Manual: Tactics and Technique FM 17–10&quot; was written, published, and distributed in March 1942. A German manual on tank platoon tactics, with a foreword by Heinz Guderian, was translated into English and issued as an Armored Force publication.

March 1942 saw a reorganization of the armored divisions in the wake of the 1941 maneuvers. Devers added an artillery headquarters to the armored division and reorganized the artillery component into three battalions, each of three batteries of six M7 Priest self-propelled guns. A division trains headquarters was added to coordinate logistical activities. In a first, at Devers&#x27; insistence, a flight of light aircraft to be used for artillery spotting and reconnaissance were included in the new Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&amp;E) for each division. He was a strong and early supporter of the development of the DUKW, an amphibious truck. Vannevar Bush later recalled that in the early stages of its development, Devers was the only man in the Army who fully appreciated its possibilities. Its value was demonstrated during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.
From 14 December 1942 to 28 January 1943, Devers went on an inspection tour of the battlefields in North Africa, along with Major General Edward H. Brooks and Brigadier General Williston B. Palmer from the Armored Force, and Gladeon M. Barnes from the Ordnance Department. He spoke with key British generals, including Harold Alexander, Bernard Montgomery, and Richard McCreery, and U.S. commanders including Eisenhower, Patton, Thomas B. Larkin and Orlando Ward, and received a great deal of feedback about American equipment. Eisenhower was defensive since he was suspicious that Marshall may have sent Devers to replace him and was nervous when Devers had critical comments about the handling of the 1st Armored Division. Devers noted that the M4 Sherman was superior to the M3 Lee with which the 1st Armored Division was equipped, but he urged the development of the more powerful 76 mm gun.

The intelligence that was gathered was nearly lost when their B-17 lost its way returning to England and crashlanded in Athenry, Republic of Ireland. Fortunately, nobody was injured, and the entire group, with the critical intelligence, made their way by train to Northern Ireland early the following morning.

In 1943, McNair took an axe to the armored division organization and dramatically downsized it. For all but the 2nd and 3rd Armored Divisions, the number of armored battalions was reduced to three. Devers favored the older larger organization. The surplus armored battalions were utilized as separate armored battalions and so by the end of 1943, there were 54 armored battalions in armored divisions and 65 non-divisional battalions. By then, the planned number of Army Ground Force divisions had been dramatically cut to 90, and McNair considered that only ten armored divisions were required and suggested for six of the sixteen armored divisions already active to be broken up. His proposal was not accepted, and the number of armored divisions was frozen at sixteen.

===European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA)===
On 3 May 1943, while on an aerial inspection tour, Lieutenant General Frank M. Andrews, European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA) commander since replacing Eisenhower on 5 February 1943, was killed in an air crash in Iceland. Marshall appointed Devers to replace Andrews. Devers arrived in England on 9 May 1943. His principal tasks were overseeing preparation of detailed plans and the buildup of men and materiel for Operation Overlord and supporting the Combined Bomber Offensive. At the end of May 1943, there were 133,000 US troops in the United Kingdom, of which 19,000 were in the ground forces, 74,000 in the air forces, and 34,000 in the services of supply. By the end of the year, their numbers had grown to 774,000, of which 265,000 were in the ground forces, 286,000 in the air forces, and 220,000 in the services of supply. In preparing the plans for Overlord, he worked closely with the Chief of Staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), British Lieutenant General Frederick E. Morgan with whom he had a good working relationship. Devers&#x27; main objection to the COSSAC plan was that he did not want American units smaller than corps directly subordinated to British command, based on what he called &quot;the Pershing Principl&quot;.
Devers clashed with Eisenhower over the diversion of ETOUSA resources to Eisenhower&#x27;s North African Theater of Operations. On 28 July 1943, Eisenhower and Lieutenant General Carl Spaatz asked that four groups of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers be sent to the North African Theater to help support Operation Avalanche, the Allied invasion of Italy. The planned assault area at Salerno was at the extreme range of Allied fighters based in Sicily, and long-range bombers were needed to isolate the battlefield. Eisenhower and Spaatz felt that their theater should have priority. However, the four groups represented about a third of the Eighth Air Force&#x27;s heavy bombers, and their departure would greatly impact the Combined Bomber Offensive, so Devers turned down the request. Devers and Eighth Air Force&#x27;s commander, Major General Ira C. Eaker, spoke to the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, who agreed with them. When Eisenhower appealed to Washington, Marshall and General Henry H. Arnold, the Chief of Army Air Forces, also supported Devers. In August, Eisenhower asked for permission to retain three groups of Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers in the North African Theater. Devers again turned down his request, and Marshall and Arnold again supported him. In September, however, when Avalanche came under severe pressure from German counterattacks, Devers readily acceded to a request for the return of the three groups. Stephen Ambrose later noted, &quot;Eisenhower was not accustomed to having his requests to Marshall turned down and found it difficult to accept&quot;.

In September 1943, AGF representatives met with Devers to discuss his needs, and he asked for 250 of the new T26E1 tanks, later redesignated the M26 Pershing, to be produced and shipped as a matter of urgency. The Ordnance Department concurred, but added on 1,000 T23 series tanks, an advanced design handicapped by problems with the reliability of its electric transmission. McNair rejected the request, writing that &quot;the M4 tank, particularly the M4A3, has been widely hailed as the best tank on the battlefield today... Other than this particular request, which represents the British view—there has been no call from any theater for a 90mm tank gun. There appears to be no fear on the part of our forces of the German Mark VI (Tiger) tank... there can be no basis for the T26 tank other than the conception of a tank versus tank duel—which is believed unsound and unnecessary... there is no indication that the 76mm antitank gun is inadequate against the Mark VI (Tiger) tank&quot;.

===North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA)===
At the Tehran Conference in November 1943, President Roosevelt named Eisenhower as the Supreme Allied Commander for Overlord. Devers hoped that he would be appointed commander of the First Army Group, but he was instead sent to the Mediterranean as Commander North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA), which was primarily a logistical administrative organization. American formations in the theater included Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark&#x27;s Fifth Army and George Patton&#x27;s Seventh Army; the Twelfth Air Force, led by Major General John K. Cannon; the Fifteenth Air Force, commanded by Major General Nathan Twining; and the NATOUSA Services of Supply, headed by Major General Thomas B. Larkin. Eaker went with Devers as Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces. Devers, who arrived at Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) in Algiers on 4 January 1944, was also deputy to the Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean Theater, British General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. Devers and Wilson worked well together, and despite the administrative nature of his position, Devers spent most of his time at the front. Wilson often had Devers deal with difficult cases like the French and the Poles, and Devers was later decorated by the Polish government-in-exile for allowing Poles who were captured in German uniform to join the Polish II Corps in Italy.
At the beginning of 1944, Allied Armies in Italy (AAI) fighting on the Italian Front were bogged down south of Rome in front of the German Gustav Line. The chain of strong defensive positions in mountainous terrain was anchored in the middle at Monte Cassino. Operation Shingle, Clark&#x27;s plan for a surprise end run to outflank the German Winter Line called for Allied landings at Anzio on Italy&#x27;s west coast, thirty miles south of Rome. On 7 January 1944, just days after he had become Wilson&#x27;s deputy, Devers attended a conference in Marrakesh to discuss Shingle. In attendance was British Prime Minister Winston Churchill; General Wilson, General Sir Harold Alexander, Commander-in-Chief of the AAI; Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham; and Major General Walter Bedell Smith. Devers wondered why such a high-level conference was required for what he saw as a simple military decision, but he noted in his diary that &quot;the individuals present all favored an amphibious operation at Anzio&quot;.

Devers clashed with Smith over the latter&#x27;s attempt to obtain officers for Eisenhower&#x27;s command. He tried to be accommodating, and consented to release a number of officers, including Patton and Major General Everett Hughes, but declined to give up others, including Larkin, Brigadier General Clarence Adcock and in particular Major General Lucian Truscott, who was commanding the 3rd Infantry Division. Eisenhower wanted Truscott to command a corps in the assault in Operation Overlord. Devers foresaw him doing the same in southern France. Eisenhower appealed to Marshall, who supported him, but Devers protested that Truscott was about to lead the 3rd Infantry Division ashore at Anzio in a few days&#x27; time. Not wanting to deprive Devers of a key subordinate on the eve of battle, Marshall backed down. Soon after the landing, Devers flew to the beachhead to see Truscott but was dismayed to find that the advance had halted on Clark&#x27;s orders. Major General John P. Lucas&#x27; VI Corps did not achieve the desired result at Anzio, and Clark&#x27;s attempted crossing of the Rapido River was a disaster.

At Monte Cassino, the historic abbey overlooked Allied positions below. Ground commanders were sure the monastery was being used by the Germans as an observation post. Lieutenant-General Bernard C. Freyberg, commander of the New Zealand Corps, who was preparing for a new assault on the mountain, had repeatedly requested for the abbey to be bombed. Taking advantage of the German practice of not giving away their positions by firing on small planes, Devers and Eaker flew low over the monastery and saw what they believed to be a radio aerial and enemy soldiers moving in and out. Wilson reluctantly agreed to its bombing. On 15 February Devers watched waves of American bombers level the monastery with Alexander, Clark, Freyberg, and Eaker. However, follow-up attacks that day and over the next eight days, failed to take the position, much less break the Gustav Line. Devers visited Anzio on 16 February and agreed with Alexander that Lucas should be relieved. Clark did so on 22 February.
The continuing failure to advance in Italy prompted the Combined Chiefs of Staff to postpone Operation Anvil, the on-again-off-again proposal for Allied landings along the coast of Southern France coinciding with Overlord. Clark told Devers that another attack on the Gustav Line could not be mounted until May, and VI Corps could not be withdrawn from Anzio until it succeeded. However, planning continued for Anvil, which had begun in mid-January by AFHQ&#x27;s Force 163 in Algiers. Initially, Clark was to lead the assault, with Lucas taking over Fifth Army. Devers did not have much faith in either of them, even before Lucas&#x27;s relief. Lyman Lemnitzer later recalled that Fifth Army staff feared that Devers would relieve Clark every time both met.

Marshall insisted that Anvil required an experienced commander, and with Patton gone, Clark was the only one in the theater. Then, Devers received a cable that IV Corps headquarters was on its way to the theater. It was commanded by Major General Alexander Patch, who had a distinguished combat record by leading the soldiers and Marines of XIV Corps in the Guadalcanal campaign in the Pacific; before that, he had commanded the 47th Infantry Regiment of the 9th Division when Devers was commanding the 9th. With Marshall&#x27;s concurrence, Devers appointed Patch to replace Patton as commander of the Seventh Army and Force 163 on 2 March. While Patch and his staff planned the operation, Devers ensured that the supplies that had been accumulated for it were not dissipated.

A successful Allied offensive in May finally broke through the Gustav Line, and Rome fell to Clark&#x27;s Fifth Army on 4 June. On 13 June, Devers ordered Larkin to shift priority for supplies from Fifth Army in Italy to Seventh Army. Two days later, Wilson ordered VI Corps to be withdrawn from the front line in preparation for Anvil. Virtually all of the material needed for the assault was on hand, on the way, or promised because of Devers&#x27;s efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.

Devers sent a cable to Marshall on 1 July proposing for an army group to be formed, with himself as commander. Eisenhower concurred with this on 12 July. It would have been easy enough to add the Seventh Army to Bradley&#x27;s 12th Army Group, but that would have meant that Eisenhower would have to deal with the French, and after his experience in Operation Torch, Eisenhower preferred to let Devers do so. Marshall made the appointment on 16 July. Thus, Devers wore four &quot;hats&quot; for the operation: Deputy Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean Theater; Commanding General NATOUSA; Commander, Advanced Detachment AFHQ, which was activated on 29 July; and Commanding General, 6th Army Group, which Devers activated on 1 August.

===France and Germany 1944–1945===

Operation Dragoon was a crushing success. In a few short weeks, the French and American forces drove the Germans from southeastern France and captured major ports, including Marseille, on 28 August. On 15 September 1944, the 6th Army Group became operational and assumed control of Patch&#x27;s Seventh Army and General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny&#x27;s French First Army, as it became on 19 September. The French First Army was the largest French force that was ever amassed under a foreign military leader. Eisenhower&#x27;s SHAEF assumed operational control of the 6th Army Group although Devers retained his own logistical system via the Mediterranean. The campaign was not without cost, and concurrent combat in Normandy and Italy created a shortage of replacements, especially infantry, which left VI Corps about 5,200 men short.

Devers remained in command of NATOUSA and so he sent Clark a message on 19 October suggesting for units to be rested to keep casualties down. Devers had written to McNair on 4 February 1944 and noted that when divisions were left in the line for more than 30 to 40 days, fatigue, carelessness, and exposure resulted in increased casualty and sickness rates. Clark replied that &quot;your radio indicates a lack of appreciation of our tactical situation, the terrain, enemy resistance, and my mission&quot;. Devers noted in his diary that Clark&#x27;s response &quot;shows quite well his lack of judgment and tact and indicate definitely that he is not a team player&quot;, and he recommended to Marshall that Eaker, not Clark, be his successor in the Mediterranean. Marshall chose Lieutenant General Joseph T. McNarney on 22 October.

The activation of the French First Army left Seventh Army with only one corps. Devers asked for IV Corps to be transferred from Italy, but Wilson argued that would adversely affect operations in Italy against the Gothic Line, and the Combined Chiefs agreed. Instead, Devers proposed on 26 September that Major General Wade H. Haislip&#x27;s XV Corps to be transferred from Patton&#x27;s Third Army, which had severe logistical difficulties, to the Seventh Army. Devers argued that they could better be supported over the 6th Army Group&#x27;s line of communications from the Mediterranean. Eisenhower agreed and further ordered for three more divisions scheduled to join Bradley&#x27;s 12th Army Group in Northern France (although they were unlikely to do so until the supply and the transport situations improved), be diverted to Marseilles, and join the 6th Army Group. Haislip was a good fit: he spoke French fluently, had fought in France during World War I, had attended the &quot;École Superieure de Guerre&quot; from 1925 to 1927, and was attuned to French sensibilities. Above all, Haislip got along well with Major General Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, the mercurial commander of the French 2nd Armored Division. Devers was shocked when Leclerc informed him that he and his men wanted to serve with the U.S. Army, not the French First Army, which he considered dominated by Vichy French traitors.
Devers may have oversold the benefits of the southern line of communications. Marseille had been captured, but the harbor entrance was blocked with 75 sunken ships; the harbor basin had been sown with naval mines; the quays, jetties and cranes had been demolished; and the surrounding area had been filled land mines and booby traps. The U.S. Navy cleared the harbor, and the 1051st Port Construction and Repair Group undertook the rehabilitation of the port. Ships were able to discharge in the stream from 5 September, and the first Liberty ship docked on 15 September. Beyond the port, there were numerous breakages in the rail network, and many bridges were down. To get the railroad from Marseille working, Devers turned to Brigadier General Carl R. Gray Jr., the commander of the 1st Military Railway Service. By 25 September, the railroad had reached Lyon with a capacity of per day. Devers pressed Gray for . By 1 October, when Devers had promised Eisenhower that he could support ten divisions by rail, sufficient supplies were arriving for just one. The rest had to be supported by road. Not until the third week in October could all of the Seventh Army&#x27;s needs, including those of XV Corps, be met.

Devers conceded that he could supply Patton with only per day from 15 November, which only increased Eisenhower&#x27;s resolve to give priority to opening the port of Antwerp, in the north. Devers was ordered to clear the Germans from the west bank of the Rhine in his sector. His offensive went well; the French 1st Armored Division reached the Rhine on 19 November, and Leclerc captured Strasbourg on 23 November. Devers inflicted a crushing defeat on the German Nineteenth Army, nearly destroying six of its eight divisions. A large German presence remained west of the Rhine, which came to be called the Colmar Pocket. When Eisenhower and Bradley visited 6th Army Group on 24 November, they were astonished to find Devers, Patch, and Haislip energetically planning a crossing of the Rhine in early December. Bradley drew attention to the formidable defenses on the far bank, and Devers told him that he had spoken to patrols, who had found them empty. Eisenhower would have none of it. His strategy remained to destroy the German forces on the west bank before he would attempt a crossing. Official historians described this decision as &quot;difficult to understand&quot;.
An attempt to reduce the Colmar Pocket on 15 December was called off by Eisenhower when Bradley was hit by the German Ardennes Offensive, which Brigadier General Garrison H. Davidson, the Seventh Army Engineer, felt might have been avoided entirely if Devers had been allowed to proceed with the Rhine crossing. In response to the crisis, Eisenhower ordered Devers to cease offensive operations and to assume responsibility for much of Patton&#x27;s front, which would allow the Third Army to turn north. That left the Seventh Army holding a front with six infantry and two armored divisions. Eisenhower ordered Devers to withdraw to a shorter line, but Devers balked at that, and there was a violent French reaction to the prospect of abandoning Strasbourg. On 31 December 1944, the Seventh Army was struck by Operation Nordwind. Between 5 and 25 January 1945, there were four more major German attacks against the 6th Army Group by Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s Army Group Oberrhein. Seventh Army suffered some 14,000 casualties, but the Germans did not break through, and Strasbourg was held. In Devers&#x27; estimation Brooks, the commander of VI Corps, &quot;fought one of the great defensive battles of all times with very little&quot;.

Devers now turned his attention to the Colmar Pocket. He had expected the Germans to withdraw and thought that the French First Army could reduce the pocket. He later admitted that he had underestimated the German determination to hold it and had overestimated de Lattre&#x27;s ability to keep moving against renewed and strengthened German resistance. Eisenhower regarded the pocket as a &quot;sore&quot; and sent five additional American divisions to 6th Army Group. After the Ardennes Offensive and Operation Northwind, Devers regarded it as petty of Bradley to begrudge him the additional divisions. French and American troops finally eliminated the Colmar Pocket on 5 February 1945. Against Eisenhower&#x27;s preference, Devers was promoted to general on 8 March 1945, ahead of Spaatz, Bradley, and Patton, remaining the second-highest ranking American officer in Europe, after Eisenhower.

Seventh Army crossed the Rhine on 26 March and began advancing into Germany. On 5 May 1945, General Hermann Foertsch surrendered Army Group G unconditionally to Devers. Patch, Haislip, and other American generals were present, but there was no representative of the French First Army. That caused a final diplomatic tussle with the French over the status of the German Twenty-Fourth Army, which de Lattre insisted should surrender to him. Devers refused to hand the 24th Army&#x27;s General Hans Schmidt over to de Lattre. Two days later, Eisenhower accepted a general surrender of the German armed forces at his headquarters at Reims.

===Army Ground Forces===
Following the surrender of Germany on 8 May 1945, Seventh Army was transferred to 12th Army Group, and the French First Army reverted to French control, which left 6th Army Group with little to do, although Devers acted as commander of 12th Army Group in Bradley&#x27;s absence. In June 1945, Devers was appointed Chief of Army Ground Forces, in succession to General Joseph Stilwell, who had left to command the Tenth United States Army on Okinawa. Army Ground Forces still controlled schools and training centers in the United States, but their focus was demobilization and the co-ordination of the redeployment of units from Europe to the Pacific, where the war with Japan continued until it also surrendered on 14 August 1945. Devers hired a civilian secretary, Dorothy Benn, a widow whose husband, an Army Air Forces pilot, had been listed as missing in action in New Guinea in 1943 and was presumed dead until his body was found in 1957.
The Army Service Forces were abolished on 14 May 1946 on the recommendation of War Department&#x27;s Simpson Board, but the Army Ground Forces remained. Devers&#x27;s November 1945 testimony before the board had urged for the Army Service Forces to be retained. Army Ground Forces was given control of the six armies in the United States, but as demobilization continued, the strength of the army shrank dramatically. Devers was faced with the unpleasant task of informing many officers that they were being demoted. One reform that he achieved was to reduce the number of combat branches to three: infantry, armor, and artillery.

McNair had established Army Ground Forces headquarters at the Army War College campus, where Devers lived, but Stilwell had moved the headquarters into the Pentagon. Eisenhower, as the new Chief of Staff of the Army, decided that the Army Ground Forces headquarters should be co-located with the Army Air Forces&#x27; Tactical Air Command at Fort Monroe, Virginia, not far from Langley Field. Devers opened his headquarters there on 1 October 1946.

Further reorganization occurred on 10 March 1948, when Army Ground Forces was renamed Army Field Forces. Control of the armies was transferred to the Department of the Army, and Army Field Forces were reduced to a coordinating staff agency.

As a member of the Joint Research and Development Committee with Spaatz, Devers took an interest in the development of helicopters and took rides in different machines. He met with Larry Bell, the founder of Bell Aircraft. The company was in a poor financial situation, and Bell hoped the army would buy fifty of his new Bell 47 helicopters. Devers was impressed with the aircraft and agreed to do so but for $25,000 each, rather than the $35,000 asked for by Bell; Devers found the money from Army Ground Forces funds. The Bell H-13 Sioux became one of the world&#x27;s most recognizable helicopters.

==Retirement and post-military career==
Devers was given mandatory retirement on his 62nd birthday, 30 September 1949. Devers and his wife, Georgie, decided to buy a farm in Herndon, West Virginia, although they retained their &quot;Yellow House&quot; in Georgetown, District of Columbia, where Georgie had resided during the war. Devers settled into the role of a cattle rancher. He hired Curtis and Beatrix Murphy as handyman and cook. When he discovered that they owed $2,000 in hospital bills, he paid it for them and never accepted repayment. They continued working for him until his death.
Finding that the life of a rancher did not sufficiently hold his interest, Devers accepted a job as managing director of the American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety. He hired Dorothy Benn as his executive assistant. The job mostly involved fund-raising, which Devers did not enjoy, and he left when a better opportunity as technical assistant to the president of Fairchild Aircraft presented itself in 1950. He successfully lobbied the U.S. Air Force to buy the Fairchild C-123 Provider. He was also a strong advocate of Fairchild&#x27;s AR-15 rifle, which he maintained was a much better weapon than the Army&#x27;s M14 rifle, which he described as &quot;obsolescent&quot;. As the M16 rifle, the AR-15 ultimately supplanted the M14.

Devers also served briefly in 1951 as military advisor to Frank P. Graham, the United Nations mediator in the dispute between India and Pakistan over the status of Kashmir. Eisenhower, now president, had Devers represent the United States at 10th anniversary ceremonies for the invasion of Southern France in 1954, for the dedication of Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial and the Rhone American Cemetery and Memorial in France, and for that of the Sicily–Rome American Cemetery and Memorial in Italy. In 1960, as Devers was leaving Fairchild, Eisenhower asked him to replace Marshall as chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission. He remained in that role until 1969. In May 1964, he joined a number of other retired generals, including Eaker, Clyde Eddleman and Merrill B. Twining, for Joint Exercise Desert Strike, a major military exercise.

The farm was sold, and Devers and Georgie moved back to the Yellow House in 1957. Her health declined in the 1960s; she died on 8 February 1967, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Dorothy Benn&#x27;s second husband, a Harvard economics professor who worked for the Department of Agriculture, died in 1973, and she married Devers on 28 May 1975. He died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on 15 October 1979, and was buried with Georgie at Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by Dorothy, who died in 2007; his daughter Frances, who died in 1986; his sister Catherine and stepdaughter Bonnie Benn Stratton; and her sons, Troy DuVal Stratton and W. Benn Stratton, who graduated with the West Point class of 1983. Alex Graham died in 1977; Alex and Frances are buried at Arlington near Devers and Georgie. Devers&#x27; papers are at the York County History Center in York.

<text>Louis Winslow Whittaker (February 10, 1929 – March 24, 2024) was an American mountaineer, mountain guide, and businessman. He and his twin brother, Jim Whittaker, also a renowned mountaineer and guide, were born and raised in Seattle.

==Biography==
Lou Whittaker was born in Seattle, Washington, on February 10, 1929. He and his twin brother Jim began climbing mountains at age 12. The Whittakers completed their first summit of Mount Rainier at age 16 and had climbed all of the major peaks in Washington by age 18.

Besides his worldwide mountain climbing experience, Whittaker became the most experienced glacier-travel guide by climbing to the summit of Mount Rainier over 250 times. He also established Rainier Mountaineering, Inc. (now RMI Expeditions), developed a group of successful climbing-related businesses at the Rainier Base Camp in Ashford, adjacent to Mount Rainier National Park. There he led the training of several generations of Rainier guides, many of whom continue to guide and climb elsewhere. He also led the first American ascent of the North Col of Mount Everest in 1984.

Whittaker recorded his experiences in &quot;Lou Whittaker — Memoirs of a Mountain Guide&quot;, written with Andrea Gabbard.

Big Lou, a mountain in Chelan County, Washington is named for him.

He and his wife Ingrid had two sons, who also summited Mount Rainier at the age of 12. Lou Whittaker died from congestive heart failure in Ashford, Washington on March 24, 2024, at the age of 95.

<text>Augustus Brevoort Woodward (born Elias Brevoort Woodward; November 1774 – June 12, 1827) was the first Chief Justice of the Michigan Territory. In that position, he played a prominent role in the reconstruction of Detroit following a devastating fire in 1805. He promoted an urban design based on radial avenues, as in Washington, DC and Paris. He is also known as one of the founders of the University of Michigan, established by the legislature in 1817.

==Early life==
He was born Elias Brevoort Woodward in 1774 in New York, the son of John and Ann Silvester Woodward. His mother was of Flemish ancestry, and his father was of English descent. John Woodward was a merchant and importer, as well as a member of the Continental Army. The family lived in Manhattan on the corner of Pine and Pearl Streets.

Woodward graduated from Columbia College. After working in Philadelphia as a clerk in the U.S. Treasury Department, he later read the law and practiced as an attorney in Washington, DC.

Woodward never married. His biographer, Arthur M. Woodford, describes Woodward as a prototype of Washington Irving&#x27;s Ichabod Crane. He stood tall, and was thin, sallow, and stooped. His long, narrow face was dominated by a big nose. He had thick, black hair. His contemporaries commented on his slovenliness.

While living in Washington, D.C., Woodward was described as &quot;a man of middle age, a hardened bachelor who wore nut-brown clothing . . . he slept in his office which was never swept ... and was eccentric and erratic. His friends were few and his practice was so small that he hardly made a living.&quot; But while working in Washington, he got to know President Thomas Jefferson, and they shared scientific and education interests.

==Michigan Territory==

President Thomas Jefferson and Woodward knew each other personally. Jefferson appointed Woodward on March 3, 1805, as the Michigan Territory&#x27;s first Chief Justice. When Woodward arrived in Detroit on June 30, 1805, he found the city in ruins from the devastating fire earlier that month on June 11. Few buildings were left standing.

Woodward, with Governor William Hull and associate Justices John Griffin and Frederick Bates, possessed all the legislative power in the Territory. Woodward and Griffin, along with the current Governor and a third judge, held this power from 1805 until the institution of a legislature in 1824. Woodward and Hull bickered almost constantly. One of Woodward&#x27;s legacies is the &quot;Woodward Code:&quot; a series of statutes serving as the basis of the Territorial Supreme Court legal procedures.

Woodward protected the free status of Michigan Territory in regard to slavery. In 1807 as Territorial Justice, he refused to allow the return of two slaves owned by a man in Windsor, Upper Canada (present-day Ontario). Woodward declared that any man &quot;coming into this Territory is by law of the land a freeman.&quot; Detroit became a station on the Underground Railroad, by which fugitive slaves escaped from the South. After Canada had abolished slavery, many went across the river to escape slave catchers who operated even in the northern border areas.

During the War of 1812, Governor (and later Brigadier General) Hull surrendered Detroit to the British without a shot being fired in the Battle of Detroit. While Hull and Justices Bates and Griffin left, Woodward stayed and maintained his judicial status in Detroit during the British occupation. The British offered him the office of Secretary of the Territory, but Woodward declined that offer.

Eventually, he became a problem for the British. He was asked to leave the territory and was granted safe passage to New York. The United States regained control of Detroit in 1813.

==Planning of Detroit==
Following the destruction of Detroit in the Great Fire of 1805, it fell to Woodward and Hull to oversee the rebuilding of the then territorial capital. The resulting plan drew heavily from Pierre L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s layout for Washington, D.C. Woodward proposed a system of hexagonal street blocks, with the Grand Circus at its center. Wide avenues, alternatively 200 feet and 120 feet, were designed to radiate from large circular plazas like spokes from the hub of a wheel. Most prominent of these are the construction of the six main &quot;spokes&quot; of Woodward, Michigan, Grand River, Gratiot, and Jefferson avenues and Fort Street. Cornell University professor of city planning John William Reps writes that this original 1807 design for Detroit was &quot;one of the most unusual city plans ever devised.” 

Woodward Avenue in Detroit, originally called Court House Avenue and other names, was popularly named after the justice&#x27;s work in city planning and rebuilding. Woodward, somewhat in jest, claimed the road&#x27;s name was simply related to the fact that it traveled toward the wooded area to the north of the city.

The alignment of Woodward Avenue seems to coincide with the axis of the pre-settlement Saginaw Trail which followed a route from Detroit to Saginaw via Flint. It is likely that a series of Indian trails once radiated from the approximate location of the Campus Martius and this may have inspired the choice of a radial geometry for Woodward&#x27;s city plan.

Though ambitious, Woodward&#x27;s Plan for Detroit would ultimately be discarded in 1817 while he was away in Washington. Instead of following the pattern laid out by Woodward, then Territorial Governor Lewis Cass platted 10,000-acres of the surrounding countryside into a more typical (for Midwestern America) Grid Plan of 160-acre rectangular farms girded by rectangular roads. This new platting became the basis for the modern layout of Detroit. Despite this remnants of the original plan can still be found within the city&#x27;s downtown, including the radial avenues emanating from the Campus Martius, the Campus itself, and the Grand Circus.

==Later years==
Considered a hero upon his return to Washington, DC, Woodward soon concentrated on science (a lifelong interest). He also promoted the founding of the University of Michigan (in 1817) as a state institution. With Rev. John Monteith and Father Gabriel Richard, Woodward drafted a charter for an institution under the name of the &quot;Catholepistemiad&quot; or the &quot;University of Michigania&quot;. On August 26, 1817, the Governor and Judges of the Michigan Territory signed the university act into law. The Catholepistmiad originally had the authority to &quot;establish colleges, academies, schools, libraries, museums, atheneums, botanical gardens, laboratories, and other useful literary and scientific institutions consonant to the laws of the United States and of Michigan, and provide for and appoint Directors, Visitors, Curators, Librarians, Instructors and Instructrixes among and throughout the various counties, cities, towns, townships, or other geographical divisions of Michigan.&quot; He urged its development along similar themes to the University of Virginia, which was founded two years after the founding of the University of Michigan (in 1819) by Woodward&#x27;s friend and former president, Thomas Jefferson.

Woodward was described as being among the first to recognize the coming of the scientific age. In 1816, he published his seminal work, &quot;A System of Universal Science&quot;.

Woodward was also a Freemason.

August 26, 1824, saw Woodward&#x27;s return to the judiciary, as President James Monroe appointed him to a judgeship in the new Territory of Florida. Woodward served in that capacity until his death in Tallahassee on June 12, 1827, at the age of 52.

==Legacy and honors==
*Woodward is commemorated in a Michigan Legal Milestone erected by the State Bar of Michigan.
*Woodward Avenue in Detroit is named after him.

<text>John McAuley Palmer (April 23, 1870 – October 26, 1955) was a soldier and administrator in the United States Army.

==Early life and start of career==
Born in Carlinville, Illinois, he was the son of John and Ellen Palmer, and the grandson and namesake of John McAuley Palmer, a famous American Civil War general and Governor of Illinois. He was educated in Springfield, Illinois, graduated from West Point in 1892, and was appointed a second lieutenant of infantry, initially assigned to the 15th Infantry at Fort Sheridan, Illinois. He participated in the suppression of the Chicago railroad riots of 1894, then went to Cuba as an aide to Samuel S. Sumner (1898–1899) during the Spanish–American War.

Following his Cuba service, he became a member of the China Relief Expedition, after which he became an instructor and assistant professor of chemistry at West Point. Following this academic stint, he was then assigned a billet as governor of Lanao District on Mindanao in the Philippines during the Moro Rebellion. Upon return from Far East Service, he was a student at the United States Army Command and General Staff College. After graduating he was assigned to the War Department General Staff under the command of the then-Army Chief of Staff Leonard Wood in 1908. During this period of service he received recognition as a writer and advocate on military theory.

==Later career and World War I==
In 1910 he rejoined his regiment in Tientsin (Tianjin) China and was promoted to the permanent rank of major. He was then transferred to the 24th Infantry on Corregidor and was instrumental in creating the plans for the defense of the Bataan Peninsula (1914–1916).

Following this assignment, he returned to the General Staff in Washington, D.C. (1916) and on the outbreak of the First World War was instrumental in drafting the Draft Act of 1917 and plans for an American Expeditionary Force (AEF). This work caught the notice of Major General John J. Pershing, who selected Palmer to become his Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, G-3, where he went to France and set up operational plans and staff schools for the American Army. He left the AEF staff due to illness, but recovered in time, as a colonel, to command the 58th Infantry Brigade of the 29th Division in combat against the enemy at Verdun in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive that helped to end World War I. He received the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his service in France. The citation for the medal reads:

As the principal formulator of military policy following World War I, he was the guiding force in the creation of the National Defense Act of 1920. It was this Act which reaffirmed America&#x27;s reliance upon the citizen-soldier for her defense and established the &quot;Total Army&quot; composed of the Regular Army, the National Guard, and the Army Reserve. In this work he was strongly influenced by his reading of Carl von Clausewitz&#x27;s book &quot;On War&quot;. For his accomplishments, he was made aide-de-camp to Army Chief of Staff John J. Pershing (1921–1923) and promoted to permanent brigadier general in the Regular Army (1922). He then completed his military career by commanding the 19th Infantry Brigade in Panama (1923–1926).

==Retirement and death==
In retirement (1926), General Palmer continued to champion the cause of universal military service. He wrote numerous books and articles about military policy. A strong advocate of the role of the citizen-soldier in the army of a democracy, Palmer diverged from the views of Emory Upton, with whom he is often compared as a great philosophical thinker-philosopher of the U.S. Army.

He was recalled to active duty by Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall (a personal friend and devotee of Palmer&#x27;s) just prior to the Pearl Harbor attack and served as an advisor on military policy to the War Department General Staff throughout World War II. Palmer was the oldest American officer to serve in the military during the war.

Palmer retired again soon after the end of the Second World War, receiving a second Distinguished Service Medal.

He lived in Washington, D.C. where he died on October 26, 1955. Palmer was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Section 34, Grave 50-A.

==Family==
In 1893, Palmer married Maude Laning, and they were the parents of a son, John McAuley Palmer IV, who died at age 6, and a daughter, Mary Laning Palmer. Mary Palmer was married to Norman B. Chandler, and after his death during World War II she married George H. Rockwell. Mary Palmer was the mother of Army Colonels Norman Palmer Chandler (1924-1997) and John Palmer Chandler (1926-2015).

==Decorations==

<doc id="1248524" wikidata="Q420014" url="?curid=1248524" title="Lipoprotein lipase">
<text>Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (EC 3.1.1.34, systematic name triacylglycerol acylhydrolase (lipoprotein-dependent)) is a member of the lipase gene family, which includes pancreatic lipase, hepatic lipase, and endothelial lipase. It is a water-soluble enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins, such as those found in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), into two free fatty acids and one monoacylglycerol molecule:

:triacylglycerol + H2O = diacylglycerol + a carboxylate

It is also involved in promoting the cellular uptake of chylomicron remnants, cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, and free fatty acids. LPL requires ApoC-II as a cofactor.

LPL is attached to the luminal surface of endothelial cells in capillaries by the protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol HDL-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) and by heparan sulfated peptidoglycans. It is most widely distributed in adipose, heart, and skeletal muscle tissue, as well as in lactating mammary glands.

==Synthesis==

In brief, LPL is secreted from heart, muscle and adipose parenchymal cells as a glycosylated homodimer, after which it is translocated through the extracellular matrix and across endothelial cells to the capillary lumen. After translation, the newly synthesized protein is glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum. The glycosylation sites of LPL are Asn-43, Asn-257, and Asn-359. Glucosidases then remove terminal glucose residues; it was once believed that this glucose trimming is responsible for the conformational change needed for LPL to form homodimers and become catalytically active. In the Golgi apparatus, the oligosaccharides are further altered to result in either two complex chains, or two complex and one high-mannose chain. In the final protein, carbohydrates account for about 12% of the molecular mass (55-58 kDa).

Homodimerization is required before LPL can be secreted from cells. After secretion, LPL is carried across endothelial cells and presented into the capillary lumen by the protein glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1.

==Structure==

Crystal structures of LPL complexed with GPIHBP1 have been reported. LPL is composed of two distinct regions: the larger N-terminus domain that contains the lipolytic active site, and the smaller C-terminus domain. These two regions are attached by a peptide linker. The N-terminus domain has an α/β hydrolase fold, which is a globular structure containing a central β sheet surrounded by α helices. The C-terminus domain is a β sandwich formed by two β sheet layers, and resembles an elongated cylinder.

==Mechanism==

The active site of LPL is composed of the conserved Ser-132, Asp-156, and His-241 triad. Other important regions of the N-terminal domain for catalysis includes an oxyanion hole (Trp-55, Leu-133), a lid region (residues 216-239), as well as a β5 loop (residues 54-64). The ApoC-II binding site is currently unknown, but it is predicted that residues on both N-and C-terminal domains are necessary for this interaction to occur. The C-terminal domain appears to confer LPL’s substrate specificity; it has a higher affinity for large triacylglyceride-rich lipoproteins than cholesterol-rich lipoproteins. The C-terminal domain is also important for binding to LDL’s receptors. Both the N-and C-terminal domains contain heparin binding sites distal to the lipid binding sites; LPL therefore serves as a bridge between the cell surface and lipoproteins. Importantly, LPL binding to the cell surface or receptors is not dependent on its catalytic activity.

The LPL non-covalent homodimer has a head-to-tail arrangement of the monomers. The Ser/Asp/His triad is in a hydrophobic groove that is blocked from solvent by the lid. Upon binding to ApoC-II and lipid in the lipoprotein, the C-terminal domain presents the lipid substrate to the lid region. The lipid interacts with both the lid region and the hydrophobic groove at the active site; this causes the lid to move, providing access to the active site. The β5 loop folds back into the protein core, bringing one of the electrophiles of the oxyanion hole into position for lipolysis. The glycerol backbone of the lipid is then able to enter the active site and is hydrolyzed.

Two molecules of ApoC-II can attach to each LPL dimer. It is estimated that up to forty LPL dimers may act simultaneously on a single lipoprotein. In regard to kinetics, it is believed that release of product into circulation is the rate-limiting step in the reaction.

== Function ==

LPL gene encodes lipoprotein lipase, which is expressed in the heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. LPL functions as a homodimer, and has the dual functions of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand/bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. Through catalysis, VLDL is converted to IDL and then to LDL. Severe mutations that cause LPL deficiency result in type I hyperlipoproteinemia, while less extreme mutations in LPL are linked to many disorders of lipoprotein metabolism.

==Regulation==

LPL is controlled transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally. The circadian clock may be important in the control of &quot;Lpl&quot; mRNA levels in peripheral tissues.

LPL isozymes are regulated differently depending on the tissue. For example, insulin is known to activate LPL in adipocytes and its placement in the capillary endothelium. By contrast, insulin has been shown to decrease expression of muscle LPL. Muscle and myocardial LPL is instead activated by glucagon and adrenaline. This helps to explain why during fasting, LPL activity increases in muscle tissue and decreases in adipose tissue, whereas after a meal, the opposite occurs.

Consistent with this, dietary macronutrients differentially affect adipose and muscle LPL activity. After 16 days on a high-carbohydrate or a high-fat diet, LPL activity increased significantly in both tissues 6 hours after a meal of either composition, but there was a significantly greater rise in adipose tissue LPL in response to the high-carbohydrate diet compared to the high-fat diet. There was no difference between the two diets&#x27; effects on insulin sensitivity or fasting LPL activity in either tissue.

The concentration of LPL displayed on endothelial cell surface cannot be regulated by endothelial cells, as they neither synthesize nor degrade LPL. Instead, this regulation occurs by managing the flux of LPL arriving at the lipolytic site and by regulating the activity of LPL present on the endothelium. A key protein involved in controlling the activity of LPL is ANGPTL4, which serves as a local inhibitor of LPL. Induction of ANGPTL4 accounts for the inhibition of LPL activity in white adipose tissue during fasting. Growing evidence implicates ANGPTL4 in the physiological regulation of LPL activity in a variety of tissues.

An ANGPTL3-4-8 model was proposed to explain the variations of LPL activity during the fed-fast cycle. Specifically, feeding induces ANGPTL8, activating the ANGPTL8–ANGPTL3 pathway, which inhibits LPL in cardiac and skeletal muscles, thereby making circulating triglycerides available for uptake by white adipose tissue, in which LPL activity is elevated owing to diminished ANGPTL4; the reverse is true during fasting, which suppresses ANGPTL8 but induces ANGPTL4, thereby directing triglycerides to muscles. The model suggests a general framework for how triglyceride trafficking is regulated.

==Clinical significance==
Lipoprotein lipase deficiency leads to hypertriglyceridemia (elevated levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream). In mice, overexpression of LPL has been shown to cause insulin resistance, and to promote obesity.

A high adipose tissue LPL response to a high-carbohydrate diet may predispose toward fat gain. One study reported that subjects gained more body fat over the next four years if, after following a high-carbohydrate diet and partaking of a high-carbohydrate meal, they responded with an increase in adipose tissue LPL activity per adipocyte, or a decrease in skeletal muscle LPL activity per gram of tissue.

LPL expression has been shown to be a prognostic predictor in Chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In this haematological disorder, LPL appears to provide fatty acids as an energy source to malignant cells. Thus, elevated levels of LPL mRNA or protein are considered to be indicators of poor prognosis.

==Interactions==
Lipoprotein lipase has been shown to interact with LRP1. It is also a ligand for α2M, GP330, and VLDL receptors. LPL has been shown to be a ligand for LRP2, albeit at a lower affinity than for other receptors; however, most of the LPL-dependent VLDL degradation can be attributed to the LRP2 pathway. In each case, LPL serves as a bridge between receptor and lipoprotein.
While LPL is activated by ApoC-II, it is inhibited by ApoCIII.

==In other organisms==
The LPL gene is highly conserved across vertebrates. Lipoprotein lipase is involved in lipid transport in the placentae of live bearing lizards (&quot;Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii&quot;).

<text>New Zealand National Airways Corporation, popularly known as NAC, established by the New Zealand National Airways Act, 1945, was the national domestic airline of New Zealand until 1978 when it amalgamated with New Zealand&#x27;s international airline, Air New Zealand. The airline was headquartered in Wellington.

NAC was itself a government-led amalgamation of RNZAF 40 Transport Squadron, Union Airways and a number of other smaller operators, including the country&#x27;s first commercial air service Air Travel (NZ) Ltd. At the time of its inception (1945), it was equipped with de Havilland Dragon Rapides, de Havilland Fox Moths, Douglas DC-3s, Lockheed Electras, Lockheed Lodestars, and one de Havilland Express which latter was returned to the RNZAF before the official 1947 inaugural start date.
Although chiefly a domestic airline, in late 1947 NAC also provided international services to some nearby South Pacific countries, using converted ex-Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Short Sunderland IIIs, as well as long-range Douglas DC-3Ds to Fiji via Norfolk Island.

By the time of the merger with Air New Zealand, the fleet consisted of 25 aircraft, Boeing 737s and Fokker F27s. Engineering workshops were set up at Christchurch, Whenuapai (Auckland), Palmerston North, Gisborne and Nelson.

==History==

===Initial services===
The NAC network started with the following destinations:
Kaitaia, Kaikohe, Whangārei, Auckland, Tauranga, Gisborne, Napier, New Plymouth, Palmerston North, Wellington, Blenheim, Nelson, Christchurch, Westport, Greymouth, Hokitika, Whataroa, Waiho (Franz Josef), Haast, Dunedin and Invercargill previously served by the same aircraft and personnel under the pre-nationalisation names Union Airways and Air Travel (NZ) Ltd.

The destinations that formed the NAC Pacific Island Network were Norfolk Island, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and the Cook Islands previously served by No. 40 Squadron RNZAF.

====Domestic services====

The initial network was based on destinations served by the airlines it was formed from. New destinations added between then and airline&#x27;s merger with Air New Zealand included:

*Rotorua in April 1948
*Wanganui in November 1954
*Timaru in April 1957
*Whakatāne in November 1962
*Taupō and Oamaru in March 1966

In November 1956 the NAC services from Hokitika to South Westland were once again taken over by West Coast Airways. Other destinations removed from the network were Greymouth in 1951 and Kaikohe in August 1970.

====Pacific Island services====
NAC served the Pacific Islands in various capacities. Services began in 1947 using Douglas DC-3 aircraft and included Norfolk Island, Tonga, Samoa and the Cook Islands. Fiji was also served by NAC using Short Sunderland III&#x27;s from the RNZAF. All services were withdrawn and taken over by TEAL on 15 October 1952, except for Norfolk Island which continued until September 1955.

In June 1975, Air New Zealand commenced Norfolk Island services with a chartered NAC Fokker F27-500 Friendship.

NAC wanted to return to the Pacific area in the late 1970s and began to lobby the NZ Government for a return of its international licence as it planned to equip with the larger Boeing 727-200. This was one of the catalysts for the forced merger with Air New Zealand in 1978, as the latter airline felt it could lose the Pacific Islands and charter market to NAC.

==Destinations==
NAC flew to the following domestic destinations on 1 April 1978:

* Kaitaia
* Whangārei
* Auckland
* Hamilton
* Tauranga
* Whakatāne
* Rotorua
* Taupō
* Gisborne
* Napier
* New Plymouth
* Wanganui
* Palmerston North
* Wellington
* Blenheim
* Nelson
* Westport
* Hokitika
* Christchurch
* Oamaru
* Timaru
* Dunedin
* Invercargill

===Alliance===
NAC entered an alliance with the following airlines:

* Air New Zealand
* British Airways
* Pan American Airways
* Qantas
* Singapore Airlines
* Trans Australian Airlines (TAA)
==Fleet history==
===Piston power===

After World War Two NAC continued to rely on prewar &#x27;tailwheel&#x27; types of aircraft. Both the high-speed twin-engine 10 seat Lockheed Model 10 Electra and the 15 seat Lockheed Lodestar were used, along with the slower British built de Havilland Rapide/Dominie and single-engine Fox Moth. All three twin-engine types could operate into all airports while the Rapide and Fox Moth could land on remote beaches on the West Coast as well as some lighthouse station airstrips. The de Havilland Dominie operated until 1963.

====Douglas DC-3====

The Douglas DC-3 was the airline&#x27;s major type right through to the mid-1960s with up to 27 being operated over time.

NAC operated a large airfreight network using dedicated DC-3 cargo planes under the &#x27;Freightair&#x27; banner. These aircraft operated into airports that were not on the regular passenger network, such as Opotiki, Masterton, Alexandra and Roxburgh.

In the 1960s NAC&#x27;s 12 best DC-3 &quot;Douglas Liner&quot; airframes were upgraded. This included better soundproofing, new interior fittings, and the fitting of larger windows. This was in response to competition in the provincial market from SPANZ, who operated DC-3s equipped with large double sized &#x27;viewmaster&#x27; windows. NAC&#x27;s upgraded aircraft were branded as &#x27;Skyliners&#x27;. In 1954, NAC asked the government to encourage the development of airports so it could operate the Convair 440 or the Elizabethan airliner.

NAC continued using DC-3s into the 1970s. Kaikohe was permanently dropped as a destination in 1972. Passenger services to Timaru and Oamaru were operated with DC-3s until their runways were paved. One &#x27;Skyliner&#x27; DC-3 renamed &quot;Waitaki&quot; was kept on for this service, until December 1974.

====De Havilland Heron====

NAC operated one tricycle landing gear type of piston-powered airliner in the 1950s, the de Havilland Heron 1. Being the first four Herons produced they had fixed undercarriages instead of the retractable undercarriage on later models. The original use for this aircraft was to keep Cook Strait services to Wellington operating while Rongotai airport was being rebuilt. The Herons operated mainly from Nelson in the South Island as well as to Blenheim, Rotorua, and Hamilton. Their heavy engines caused wing spar fatigue due to the light aluminium alloy used. Steel spars were substituted but with a weight penalty reducing passenger numbers to below economical levels. De Havilland did offer the Heron 2, a major improvement over the Heron 1 but this was not taken up. Heron ZK-BEQ was used as a royal aircraft when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip visited New Zealand for the first time in 1953–54.

When the old Rongotai airfield closed in 1957, the Herons were considered for the Nelson-Christchurch-Invercargill route but the aircraft were sold off to private operators instead. By then, only the DC-3 and Rapide/Dominies made up the NAC Fleet.

The last type of piston engine airliner to be operated by NAC was a leased Mt Cook Airline Britten Norman BN2 Islander ZK-MCD, used during 1976–77 to operate a service on the Auckland – Whangārei – Kaitaia route. This was to allow services to operate while Kaitaia&#x27;s compacted gravel runway was sealed for use by heavier aircraft. The Islander using an alternative grass strip. It was repainted in the &quot;new&quot; Wings of the Nation red and orange colour scheme.

===Turboprops===

====Vickers Viscount 807====

The pioneering turbo-prop powered Vickers Viscount first appeared in New Zealand in 1953 when an early model -700 was flown out for the London to Christchurch Air Race. In 1954, after the New Zealand Government encouraged the development of nationwide airports and with the promise of Wellington Airport being completed in 1958, NAC ordered four of the new larger 800 series type.

The Vickers Viscount 807s were introduced from 1958, three initially being purchased. The first was used as a training aircraft and operated alone for a year on the Christchurch-Auckland route, and to Palmerston North which substituted for a still uncompleted Wellington International Airport. Services to Wellington began the following year, after the major reconstruction of Wellington&#x27;s Rongotai Airport was completed a year later, two more Viscounts had joined the first by then. Services to Dunedin began late in 1962 with the purchase of the fourth aircraft in 1960, after the closure of Taieri Aerodrome to airliners and the opening of the larger Momona Airport further down the Taieri Plain.

The famous &#x27;Viscount Jump&#x27; effect saw passenger numbers swell. Powered by four Rolls-Royce Dart turboprops, the Viscount was two generations ahead of the DC-3. In 1966 NAC bought a second-hand aircraft, modifying it to 807 standards, bringing the fleet to five. This opened up Viscount services to Hamilton and Invercargill.

The Vickers Viscount continued on until the last was withdrawn in 1975 when the &#x27;807&#x27; type had started to develop wing spar fatigue. The end of the Viscount era also realised NAC&#x27;s wishes to operate a two aircraft type fleet. Two extra Boeing 737-200s were purchased as replacements (see below).

It would be another twenty years before the Viscount&#x27;s natural successor, the ATR 72-200, would take over the major provincial services.

====Fokker F27 Friendship====

For the growing provincial routes, it was a Dutch-built 30-seat airliner that would be the true successor to the DC-3. The Fokker F27-100 short-haul airliner suited the NAC provincial network perfectly and, like the Viscount, was Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop-powered would prove popular. The &#x27;Friendship&#x27; had been flying since 1956. However, the British government attempted to force NAC&#x27;s hand into purchasing the similar Handley Page Herald, reminding their New Zealand counterparts of possible trade tariffs being imposed on purchasing a &#x27;foreign&#x27; aircraft. A British European Airways-owned Herald was flown out to New Zealand and participated in the opening of Wellington&#x27;s rebuilt airport, putting on a short field and extreme manoeuvering air display. BEA management offered to leave the demonstration Herald with NAC for a year to trial on proposed routes. The New Zealand government intervened saying the Fokker aircraft had already proved itself while the Herald was still in test mode for its changed powerplants. The Fokker F27s were also Rolls-Royce powered while most of its electronic and mechanical components were made in the United Kingdom, thus negating tariff restrictions. So the Dutch built airliner won the day and a large order over time.

The Friendships began service with the first arriving in late 1960. Another seven arrived during 1961, launching provincial turbo-prop services to Hamilton, Napier, New Plymouth, Wanganui, Nelson, Blenheim, and Invercargill. They primarily operated to regional airports with sealed runways, and also on the main trunk route alongside the Viscounts, flying the off-peak services replacing the DC-3. They operated the first services to Dunedin&#x27;s new Momona Airport in 1962 until traffic built up enough to use the Viscounts there. Four more secondhand -100s joined the fleet and five of the larger Fokker F27 Friendship Mk500s were purchased, three new and two secondhand, from 1973. NAC colours would return to the international Norfolk Island run, albeit under an Air New Zealand charter, with an Mk500 model flying the Auckland to Norfolk Is route.

The Friendships served New Zealand for thirty years, latterly under Air New Zealand ownership, progressively being rundown through the 1980s before the last of the fleet was withdrawn in 1990.

===Jet power===
As early as 1959, when the first Vickers Viscounts were entering service, NAC management discussed when to equip with pure jet aircraft. In 1963 NAC hired a de Havilland Comet 4 from Christchurch to Auckland covering the distance in 1 hour and 20 minutes. The decision to equip with jet aircraft was finally made by the NAC board of directors in 1965.

After a global tender was let, three twinjet aircraft were shortlisted, the BAC 1-11, Douglas DC-9 and the Boeing 737. The main criterion for the candidate aircraft was the ability to safely fly in and out of Wellington Airport&#x27;s unique right-hand inner harbour circuit. When NAC management chose the new Boeing aircraft over the already proven BAC 1-11, the pro-British-leaning National Government promptly turned down the request for precious funds and told NAC to redo their sums again.
NAC rebuffed the government&#x27;s order and argued that the Boeing 737 was the best fit for the growing network. So confident was the airline that Boeing secured early delivery slots on the production line for NAC.

NAC won the Government over with the logic of simple economics: three 737-200s could do the job of four BAC 1-11s. The approval was given in late 1966 for the purchase of three 737-200s.

====Boeing 737====

The first Boeing 737, ZK-NAC, arrived from Seattle via Hawaii and Fiji into Wellington airport in the new livery of &quot;National Airways&quot; all-white body, blue titles, with a red cheatline and striking red &#x27;Godwit&#x27; roundel on the tail. With the arrival of ZK-NAD and ZK-NAE, full services were introduced in 1968 on the &quot;main trunk&quot; (Auckland–Wellington–Christchurch–Dunedin). Later this extended to Invercargill, Palmerston North and Hamilton in 1975 as more aircraft were added, including ZK-NAM which had been the Boeing 737-200 prototype, N1359B. Viscounts were retired as demand for jet services grew and two more 737s joined the fleet as replacements.

NAC was one of Boeing&#x27;s earliest 737 customers, the first outside the United States and West Germany. Some minor engineering tweaks to the 737 occurred during the first few years as the type developed. This included the changing of its engine&#x27;s clamshell reverse thrusters over the exhaust pipes to the more familiar &#x27;bucket&#x27; style that stayed with the 737-200 type to the end. This also helped with reducing soot emissions of the earlier model. Boeing changed the hydraulic and flap configuration of the 737 in 1973 and sold to the airline at a bargain price the last 737-200 in the original format, becoming ZK-NAJ.

===Regional jet trials===
The Boeing 737 had settled into routine service when NAC launched a small regional jet study to replace the Viscount. This included the Russian Yakolev Yak 40, Fokker F28 &#x27;Fellowship&#x27; and the still-experimental Hawker Siddeley HS146. When the country fell into an economic slump caused by the 1973 oil crisis and the United Kingdom joining the European Economic Community, the resultant drop in passenger numbers caused NAC to sell one of its new 737s after only six months in service. NAC quietly dropped the regional jet proposal and more F27-500s were purchased.

===List of aircraft operated by NAC===
===List of fleet survivors===
Ex-NAC Dragon Rapides, Fox Moths, and DC-3s still fly in private and charter operator hands. Below is a list of known surviving NAC aircraft.
==Uniforms==
In 1965–66, Barbara Penberthy of Auckland was the first New Zealander to design the airline&#x27;s uniform. Created as a departure from the &#x27;uniform look&#x27;, it was a high-fashion two-piece suit and blouse with matching coat and hat. The fabric was all-wool barathea, dyed to a colour named &#x27;golden cloud&#x27; specially created for NAC; a name by which the uniform came to be known. The suit jacket would be removed before onboard aircraft duties. The blouse consisted of three-quarter sleeves, a self-pleated panel down the front, three decorative pearl buttons at the neck and double cuffs with pearl cuff-links. The new 9ct gold NAC staff hat-badge, designed by NAC staff, framed NAC&#x27;s godwit symbol within a circle. Discarding sleeve braid, ranks were then denoted by the number of small silver stars on the bar of the jacket insignia also designed by airline staff. Stockings were in a colour specially created for the uniform and named &#x27;cirrus&#x27;. The hat, from a New Zealand milliner, was nicknamed the &#x27;Mustard Pot&#x27;.

One of the airline&#x27;s most memorable outfits was designed by Babs Radon (Barbara Penberthy) in 1970, in vibrant colours to attract younger flyers. The uniform consisted of four different coloured frocks, complemented with either a red or green jacket and matching hat. Two white frocks contrastingly trimmed with red and green on the neck and tab front, and a green and a red dress trimmed with white, were semi-fitted with a slightly A-line skirt and short sleeves. The navy blue New Zealand wool top coat, a semi-fitting single-breasted style with gold and copper buttons, was worn with a white cravat. The hostess could choose to wear the uniform with shoes in different shades or white skin-fit boots. 

Following consultation with hostesses and three years of development by a committee, which included three hostesses and specialist apparel industry advice, NAC introduced a new mix-and-match all-seasons hostess uniform in November 1976. Coordinated from six basic pieces, the uniform sought to provide the wearer with individual variety and climate suitability—a basic white polyester cotton shirtdress with a printed red and blue bold houndstooth pattern, navy blue street-length pinafore in double-knit washable wool jersey, red lambswool jumper with white banded neckline and cuffs, navy blue straight-cut slacks, navy blue short jerkin, navy blue tailored blazer, along with a red, blue and white beret for ground use. The classic navy blue coat, double-breasted and extended to mid-calf length, was retained. Relaxed uniform rules permitted hostesses to wear rings, small earrings and a silver, gold or pearl necklace.

==Other interests==

===Bay of Plenty Airways===
NAC made a rare foray into the small airline business with the purchase in September 1961 of a one third shareholding in Tauranga based Bay of Plenty Airways. This was the only occasion NAC invested in another &quot;passenger&quot; airline but ironically it was two months before the airline&#x27;s tragic loss of their Aero Commander on Mt Ruapehu. This directly led to Bay of Plenty Airways&#x27; demise. NAC took over the Wellington – Tauranga route outright shortly after.

===Mount Cook Airlines===

NAC entered an agreement in 1961 with the tourist route oriented Mount Cook Airlines, offering some of its light routes in both North and South Islands to Mount Cook with the latter airline staying away from the main trunk and larger provincial centre routes. One such route was the Christchurch to Timaru and Oamaru DC-3 service in 1966. NAC also provided Mount Cook with a &#x27;guarantor&#x27; back up when the airline purchased its first Hawker Siddeley HS 748 airliner and later a de Havilland Twin Otter. In 1973 NAC took a minor shareholding in the Mount Cook Group, the parent company of Mount Cook Airlines; Air New Zealand would later absorb this share when merger amalgamated the airlines.

===Safe Air===
In September 1972, NAC acquired 100% ownership of freight company Safe Air Limited, formerly known as Straits Air Freight Express Limited (SAFE) established in 1951, with acquisition of Air Holdings Limited&#x27;s 94% share holding. The airline operated Bristol Freighter and Armstrong Whitworth Argosy aircraft. It was to continue as a separate company based in Blenheim.

==Accidents and incidents==

===NAC Freight Air crash===
NAC suffered its first fatal air crash on 9 August 1948 when DC-3 Freighter ZK-AOE &quot;Parera&quot; crashed above Port Underwood claiming the lives of Commanders Murdo MacLeod and RJRH &quot;Dicky&quot; Makgill. The DC-3 had taken off from Woodbourne Airport near Blenheim on a routine freight flight bound for Paraparaumu and entered cloud, crashing into Scraggy Ridge. A lack of radio navigation equipment was highlighted in the crash report. Some wreckage remains on the ridge.

===Electra crash=== 
On 23 October 1948, NAC Lockheed Model 10 Electra ZK-AGK &quot;Kaka&quot; crashed on the south-western slopes of Mt Ruapehu in the centre of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island while flying in clouds. The aircraft was flying from Palmerston North to Hamilton, but drifted right off track after passing over Whanganui and collided with the mountain killing all thirteen people on board. The wreckage was located a week later near the summit. The accident highlighted the lack of air navigation radio beacons in New Zealand at the time.

===Lodestar crash===
On 18 March 1949, NAC Lockheed Lodestar ZK-AKX &quot;Keruru&quot;, crashed in the Tararua Ranges near Waikanae while approaching Paraparaumu Airport at the end of a flight from Auckland killing all 15 on board. The pilot was deemed to become disoriented in low cloud. Once again blame was given to a lack of navigational radio beacons in New Zealand.
This crash was the worst aviation disaster in New Zealand until the Kaimai Range crash in 1963. The wreckage still remains at the crash site, with the exception of the tail section which was recovered intact in 1988 and taken to the Air Force Museum at Wigram Air Force Base in Christchurch, New Zealand to complete the restoration of Lockheed Hudson NZ2013 for static display.

===Raumati Beach crash landing===
On 22 May 1954, NAC Douglas DC-3 ZK-AQT &quot;Piere&quot; operating as Flight 152 from Christchurch crash landed on Kohutuhutu Rd in the beachside settlement of Raumati Beach when approaching Paraparaumu Airport on short finals. Of the 26 people on board, 23 survived. The pilot, Captain Bill Pettet, managed to get the passenger door open before the fire reached it. Three unaccompanied infant children died. NAC was subsequently ordered to have a stewardess on board all DC-3 flights with unaccompanied children under 12 years of age. The crash was caused by fuel starvation, the wrong fuel line cutover switch had been activated. The engines failed to restart, the aircraft hit macrocarpa trees and plunged onto the road below Dr. Stevenson-Wright&#x27;s house. Miraculously the fuselage rested right in the middle of the road without further collision but the wreck burst into flames. The doctor and his visitors ran to the passengers&#x27; aid and all but the infants walked out relatively unharmed. The doctor and his visitors had been enjoying a coffee break while looking out to sea when they saw the plane heading straight for them. They were saved by the trees.

===Kaimai disaster===

On 3 July 1963, a NAC Douglas DC-3 crashed into the Kaimai Ranges in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island while flying in clouds and turbulence. The aircraft was flying from Whenuapai, Auckland to Tauranga. The aircraft struck a vertical rock face after encountering a strong downdraft. The aircraft may also have commenced an early descent with the pilots unaware of the true position of the aircraft. All 23 people on board were killed. The wreckage remains on the hillside with a small memorial cairn beside it.

===Other incidents===
*On 19 April 1948, Lockheed Model 10 Electra ZK-AGJ &quot;Kahu&quot; on a flight from Mangere – Tauranga – Gisborne was caught in a sudden heavy squall moments before landing at Tauranga. The sudden downburst forced the Electra into the lagoon in front of the runway threshold. The passengers were unharmed; ZK-AGJ, however, was written off as uneconomical to repair.
*On 24 February 1949 Lockheed Model 10 Electra ZK-ALH &quot;Korere&quot; belly landed at Hamilton on a through flight from Auckland to Rotorua. The undercarriage collapsed, causing the Electra to slide across the airfield to a halt. Passengers were more bemused than shaken and continued their onward flight via bus.
*On 14 January 1950, NAC de Havilland DH89B Dominie ZK-ALC &quot;Tiora&quot; was preparing to take off from Rotorua Aerodrome when a backfire from the port engine ignited dry grass under the aircraft. The aircraft&#x27;s pilot, Commander Bill Rainbow, and passengers exited the aircraft leaving the starboard engine running while ground crews attempted to extinguish the fire. However, it was too late and by the time the Rotorua Fire Brigade arrived, they could only dampen down the wreckage. ZK-ALC was completely destroyed, along with the passengers&#x27; luggage.
*On 12 November 1958, brand new Vickers Viscount ZK-BRD &quot;City of Wellington&quot; suffered an accidental wheels up landing at Whenuapai when Captain &#x27;Johnny&#x27; Walker, co-piloting for Captain Peter Matheson, selected the undercarriage up lever instead of full flaps up. The Viscount slewed off the runway and onto the soft grass. Passengers were shaken and the aircraft suffered moderate superficial damage but was repaired in time for the Christmas season in December.
*On 16 October 1961, Fokker F27-100 Friendship ZK-BXB &quot;Kotuku&quot;, moments from boarding passengers and crew at Invercargill airport suffered an undercarriage failure when the portside main leg retracted. Ground crew had just removed the safety locking pin when the leg retracted. It was discovered that an undercarriage selector valve had failed.
*On 17 February 1963, Viscount ZK-BWO &quot;City of Dunedin&quot; on a flight from Auckland experienced wind shear just prior to touch down at Wellington. Towards the end of its landing run it veered off the runway embankment at the southern Moa Point Road end, none of the 37 passengers and four crew suffered injury. The aircraft was hauled back up and propellers replaced.
*On 13 July 1974, Fokker F27-100 Friendship ZK-NAF &quot;Korimako&quot; while on a flight from Christchurch to Palmerston North developed a fault in its starboard undercarriage. The captain elected to land at Wellington where the undercarriage collapsed near the end of the landing run. Minor damage to the aircraft was sustained and was soon returned to service. This was the last incident involving aircraft under NAC ownership.

==Last years==
In 1975 the airline introduced a new &quot;NAC Wings of the Nation&quot; livery – a two-toned orange colour scheme with the &#x27;Godwit&#x27; roundel on an orange tail fin. Air New Zealand DC-10s or DC-8s were often hired to move burgeoning holiday-maker numbers which brought about the idea of purchasing the larger Boeing 727-200. This would have also allowed the airline to challenge Air New Zealand on Trans Tasman and Pacific Island routes. Boeing offered to buy back NAC&#x27;s three original 737 models as trade-ins to help purchase costs and approached NAC with the then proposed B757/767 family, opening up new markets. McDonnell Douglas also joined in with a DC-10 offer to NAC, re-igniting the merger debate within the New Zealand Government.

In the end, it was Air New Zealand that was threatened by the domestic market airline and the government acted.

===Merger===

On 1 April 1978, after thirty-one years in operation, NAC merged with Air New Zealand to form the domestic arm of the airline. The highly unpopular decision to join the airline with Air New Zealand was inevitable; with full deregulation of the commercial aviation industry in New Zealand was still eight years away. The NAC fleet at the time of merger consisted of 26 aircraft:
The Godwit tail livery was hurriedly covered over with a hybrid Air New Zealand title and Koru tail scheme still using the two-tone orange NAC final colours. Small Godwit symbols were placed beneath the cockpit side windows as a link to the past. These survived into the full repainted Teal Blue era, but by the 1990s they had been painted out.

<text>Foxfire, also called fairy fire and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] fire, is the bioluminescence created by some species of fungi present in decaying wood. The bluish-green glow is attributed to a luciferase, an oxidative enzyme, which emits light as it reacts with a luciferin. The phenomenon has been known since ancient times, with its source determined in 1823.

== Description ==
Foxfire is the bioluminescence created by some species of fungi present in decaying wood. It occurs in a number of species, including &quot;Panellus stipticus&quot;, &quot;Omphalotus olearius&quot; and &quot;Omphalotus nidiformis&quot;. The bluish-green glow is attributed to luciferin, which emits light after oxidation catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase. Some believe that the light attracts insects to spread spores, or acts as a warning to hungry animals, like the bright colors exhibited by some poisonous or unpalatable animal species. Although generally very dim, in some cases foxfire is bright enough to read by.

==History==
The oldest recorded documentation of foxfire is from 382 B.C., by Aristotle, whose notes refer to a light that, unlike fire, was cold to the touch. The Roman thinker Pliny the Elder also mentioned glowing wood in olive groves.

Foxfire was used to illuminate the needles on the barometer and the compass of &quot;Turtle&quot;, an early submarine. This is commonly thought to have been suggested by Benjamin Franklin; a reading of the correspondence from Benjamin Gale, however, shows that Benjamin Franklin was only consulted for alternative forms of lighting when the cold temperatures rendered the foxfire inactive.

After many more literary references to foxfire by early scientists and naturalists, its cause was discovered in 1823. The glow emitted from wooden support beams in mines was examined, and it was found that the luminescence came from fungal growth.

The &quot;fox&quot; in &quot;foxfire&quot; may derive from the Old French word , meaning &quot;false&quot;, rather than from the name of the animal. The association of foxes with such lights is widespread, however, and occurs also in Japanese folklore.

<text>The northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus), also known as the northern native cat, the North Australian native cat or the satanellus is a carnivorous marsupial native to Australia.

== Taxonomy ==

The northern quoll is a member of the family Dasyuridae, and is often stated to be the most distinctive Australian quoll. There are three other quoll species found in Australia, and another two species found on the island of New Guinea, all of which are currently placed in the genus &quot;Dasyurus&quot;. The northern quoll was first described in 1842 by naturalist and author John Gould, who gave it the specific epithet &quot;hallucatus&quot;, indicating that it has a notable first digit. This species has sometimes been placed in a separate genus, &quot;Satanellus&quot;.

Four distinct morphological forms of the northern quoll were recognised in the 1920s, however more recent population genomic analysis has shown that these forms do not conform to the underlying genetic differentiation shown across the species distribution. Three broad population genomic clusters are present in the species, which broadly correspond to populations in the regions of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia. This population genomic structure conforms to known biogeographic barriers across northern Australia, including the Carpentarian Gap and Ord Arid Region. Finer scale population structure shows differentiation of the Groote Eylandt and Pilbara populations of quolls.

== Life history ==
The northern quoll is the smallest of the four Australian quoll species. Females are smaller than males, with adult females weighing between and adult males . Head and body length ranges from for adult males and for adult females. The tail length ranges between .

Northern quolls feed primarily on invertebrates, but also consume fleshy fruit (particularly figs), and a wide range of vertebrates, including small mammals, birds, lizards, snakes, and frogs. They also scavenge on roadkills, around campsites, and in garbage tins.

A remarkable feature of this species is that the males show complete die-off after mating, leaving the females to raise the young alone. Females have eight teats in a pouch, but apparently give birth to more than eight young which must wriggle their way to the pouch and compete for a teat to survive. In a study in Western Australia&#x27;s Kimberley region, the testosterone levels of males peaked in July, and females gave birth in July or August.

In the wild, males live for about one year, while the maximum recorded for a wild female was about three years of age. In rocky habitats, the lifespan of both sexes appears to be increased to two or three years, and individuals are larger than those living in savanna habitats, possibly due to better habitat and reduced predation.

A February 2023 study published in Royal Society Open Science found that &quot;reduced resting behaviour among males could explain the post-breeding death as the deterioration in appearance reflects that reported for sleep-deprived rodents.&quot;

== Range and habitat ==
The northern quoll occurs from the Pilbara region of Western Australia across the Northern Territory to south east Queensland. Their historical range extended uninterrupted from S.E Queensland to the Kimberley in Western Australia. There are several disjunct populations. This quoll species is most abundant in rocky ranges and open eucalypt forest. Analysis of occurrence records for the species shows that rocky areas are important for the species.

Northern quolls have declined substantially since European colonisation of Australia, with one study in the Northern Territory finding a roughly 60% contraction in their extent of occurrence. Of the nine species analysed, this decline was only exceeded by that of the brush-tailed rabbit-rat, the sole remaining species in the genus &quot;Conilurus&quot;. In the Northern Territory, northern quolls appear to be declining towards geographic areas of higher vegetation complexity, lower elevation, and milder temperatures, suggesting that, in these areas, threats may be mediated or better tolerated.

More geographically isolated populations, such as those on islands, have very small contributions to overall genetic diversity within the species, and also show relatively high levels of inbreeding compared to mainland populations.

== Conservation status ==

The northern quoll is currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN.

The species is now absent from many parts of its former range, particularly the savanna country. In 2005 it was listed as Endangered under Australian Commonwealth legislation (EPBC Act). Threats are predation by feral cats, dingoes and red foxes, particularly after fire or grazing has removed protective ground cover. Destruction, degradation, and fragmentation of the quoll&#x27;s habitat due to land clearing, grazing, pasture improvement, and mining are also significant. Quolls are also susceptible to being run over on roads.

The current major threat to the northern quoll in the northern and western portion of its range is the spread of cane toads. Like many other native Australian species, northern quolls are poisoned after eating or mouthing cane toads. Cane toads were originally introduced in Queensland, but have now occupied the Top End of the Northern Territory, including Kakadu National Park and the Darwin area, and entered the Kimberley region of Western Australia, where they are established around Kununurra and Lake Argyle.

Immediately after cane toad invasion of Kakadu, quolls became extinct at one study site and declined from 45 individuals to five at another site. The northern quoll may cease to exist in most areas in the Top End once the cane toad population completely overlaps the northern quoll&#x27;s range. However, remnant populations of northern quolls still persist in Queensland where cane toads have been present for decades. These persisting Queensland quoll populations are naturally toad averse (as observed on remote cameras). One of the northern quoll populations studied in Kakadu during the recent cane toad invasion, had a few individuals survive the invasion. These individuals were, likely similar to the Queensland quolls, genetically averse to the toads. In 2003, to help protect northern quolls, numerous quolls were transferred to the toad-free English Company Islands (Astell and Pobassoo Islands), off the coast of Arnhem Land. Quolls thrived on these islands, with an estimated population of 2193 female northern quolls on Astell Island by 2014. In 2017, quolls from Astell Island were collected, trained via conditioned taste aversion to avoid attacking cane toads and reintroduced to Kakadu National Park. This reintroduction attempt saw the release both toad-trained (22) and toad-naive (9) northern quolls to an area of Kakadu that previous had quolls but where they had recently gone locally extinct due to the invasion of cane toads. Although the toad-trained quolls survived longer than those that received no toad training, ultimately this reintroduction population rapidly went extinct because of dingo predation. Subsequently, research comparing antipredator behaviours of quolls from Astell Island and mainland Queensland determined that quolls conserved on this island had lost their ability to recognise and avoid both dingo and cats, predators they have co-evolved with on mainland Australia for at least 3500 and 150 years respectively. This study suggests that animals conserved in complete isolation from predators can rapidly lose evolved antipredator behaviours, in this case in only 13 generations, when they are no longer maintained via natural selection.

Research has shown that the conservation of a single population, or even several populations, will not prevent the loss of substantial amounts of genomic variation and adaptive capacity across the species. To conserve more than 90% of the genetic diversity of the species, at least eight separate populations of northern quolls need to be conserved, which requires conservation of populations in Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia.

In 2022, Territory Natural Resource Management (TRM) partnered with Australian Wildlife Conservancy, James Cook University, Gulf Savannah NRM, and Western Yalanji to trial conservation methods, including artificial dens for quolls, genetic research and controlled burn programs. The project received grant funding from the Australian Government’s Environment Restoration Fund.

==In Aboriginal language and culture==
The Northern Quoll is known as njanjma in the Indigenous Kundjeyhmi, Kundedjnjenghmi and Mayali languages, djabbo in Kunwinjku, and wijingarri in Wunambal. The Kunwinjku people of Western Arnhem Land (Northern Territory) regard djabbo as &quot;good tucker&quot;.

<text>The Grand Junction Jackalopes are an independent baseball team of the Pioneer League, which is not affiliated with Major League Baseball (MLB) but is an MLB Partner League. They are located in Grand Junction, Colorado, and play their home games at Suplizio Field. They were formerly named the Rockies, after the Colorado Rockies, who were their major league affiliate from 2001 to 2020 prior to the league becoming independent.

== Franchise history ==
The Butte Copper Kings, named for the once-powerful owners of the copper mines of Butte, Montana, began play in the Pioneer League in as a co-op team with players from the Philadelphia Phillies, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, and Texas Rangers organizations as well as a few free agents.

Beginning in , the franchise had been operated by Silverbow Baseball. It was sold in to the Goldklang Group in a move necessary to stem conflict-of-interest issues when Silverbow head Jim McCurdy had taken the position of President of the Pioneer League in . Silverbow had attempted to sell the franchise in 1994 to investors from California, but the deal fell through when it was determined that Silverbow owned a lesser percentage of the franchise than he had purported to own.

Following the season, the team relocated to Casper, Wyoming as the Casper Rockies (and was renamed the Ghosts before the season,) and affiliated with Colorado.

On January 13, 2011, Casper Professional Baseball Club, LLC announced the sale of the team to Monfort Investment Group, a group headed by Colorado Rockies General Partners. On October 17, 2011, Grand Junction city officials unanimously approved a lease agreement to the team, making Suplizio Field home to the newly renamed Grand Junction Rockies.

In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Pioneer League was converted from an MLB-affiliated Rookie Advanced league to an independent baseball league and granted status as an MLB Partner League, with Grand Junction continuing as a member.

On November 4, 2022, the team officially announced their new name of the Grand Junction Jackalopes.

<text>Bianca Jagger (born Blanca Pérez-Mora Macías; 2 May 1945) is a Nicaraguan social activist, human rights advocate, and a former actress. Jagger currently serves as a Council of Europe goodwill ambassador, founder and chair of the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation, member of the Executive Director&#x27;s Leadership Council of Amnesty International USA, and a trustee of the Amazon Charitable Trust.

She was married to Mick Jagger, lead singer of the Rolling Stones, from 1971 until 1978.

==Early life and education==
Jagger was born in Managua, Nicaragua, on 2 May 1945. Her father was a successful import-export merchant and her mother a housewife. They divorced when Bianca was ten and she stayed with her mother, who had to take care of three children on a small income. At the age of 16, she changed her name from Blanca to Bianca. She received a scholarship to study political science in France at the Paris Institute of Political Studies. She was also influenced by Gandhi&#x27;s non-violent success and Eastern philosophy at large. She travelled extensively in India.

==Marriage, family and public life==
Bianca met Mick Jagger at a party after a Rolling Stones concert in France in September 1970. On 12 May 1971, while she was four months pregnant, the couple married in a Roman Catholic ceremony in Saint-Tropez, France, and she became his first and only wife of a legal marriage. The couple&#x27;s only child, a daughter named Jade, was born on 21 October 1971, in Paris, France. In May 1978, Bianca Jagger filed for divorce on the grounds of his adultery with model Jerry Hall.

In addition to her extensive charitable works, Jagger had a public reputation as a jet-setter and party-goer in the 1970s and early 1980s, being closely associated in the public mind with New York City&#x27;s nightclub Studio 54. She also became known particularly as a friend of pop artist Andy Warhol.

Jagger has dual nationality, as a naturalised British citizen and citizen of Nicaragua.

Jagger has two granddaughters from her daughter Jade: Assisi Lola (born in 1992) and Amba Isis (born in 1996), and a grandson born in 2014. She became a great-grandmother in 2014 through her granddaughter Assisi.

Jagger caused a minor controversy in May 2012 when she took flash photographs during a performance of Philip Glass&#x27;s &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; at the Barbican in London.

== Epiphany ==
In 1981, Jagger was part of a US congressional delegation stationed at a UN refugee camp in Honduras. At one point during her official visit, the entire staff saw about 40 captured refugees marched away at gunpoint towards El Salvador by a death squad. Armed with nothing but cameras to document the raid, Jagger and the delegation trailed the squad along a river towards the Honduran-Salvadoran border. When both groups were within auditory range of each other, Jagger and the staff shouted at the M16 rifle-equipped raiders: &quot;You will have to kill us all!&quot; The squad considered the situation, approached the group, relieved them of their cameras, and released the cache of captives. A transformation had thus begun for Jagger. In subsequent interviews, Jagger has recounted this incident as &quot;a turning point in my life&quot;.

== Activism ==

Bianca Jagger founded the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation, which she chairs. She returned to Nicaragua to look for her parents after the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake, which destroyed Managua, the capital, leaving a toll of more than 10,000 deaths and tens of thousands homeless.

In early 1979, Jagger visited Nicaragua with an International Red Cross delegation and was shocked by the brutality and oppression that the Somoza regime carried out there. This persuaded her to commit herself to the issues of justice and human rights.

In the 1980s, she worked to oppose US government intervention in Nicaragua after the Sandinista revolution. She has also opposed the death penalty and defended the rights of women and of indigenous peoples in Latin America, notably the Yanomami tribe in Brazil against the invasion of gold miners. She spoke up for victims of the conflicts in Bosnia and Serbia. Her writings were published in several newspapers (including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Express&quot;). From the late 1970s, she collaborated with many humanitarian organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

She was also a member of the Twentieth Century Task Force to Apprehend War Criminals, and a trustee of the Amazon Charitable Trust. She gave a reading at the start of the memorial service in London&#x27;s Westminster Cathedral, which was timed to coincide with the funeral in Brazil of Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes, who was shot eight times on a tube-train after being mistaken for a suicide bomber in London. In March 2007, she became involved with Sarah Teather and the campaign to close Guantanamo Bay.

In March 2002, Jagger travelled to Afghanistan with a delegation of fourteen women, organised by Global Exchange to support Afghan women&#x27;s projects. On 16 December 2003, Jagger was nominated Council of Europe Goodwill Ambassador.

From 2007 to 2009, she was chair of the World Future Council. On 7 July 2007, Jagger presented at the German leg of Live Earth in Hamburg. In July 2008, she was a signatory to a petition to the Catholic bishops of England and Wales to allow the wider celebration of the traditional Latin Mass. In January 2009, Jagger addressed some 12,000 people who rallied in Trafalgar Square in protest against an Israeli offensive in the Gaza several days earlier.

She is a &quot;messenger&quot;, more accurately termed ambassador, for the environmental organization 350.org.

She has served as IUCN&#x27;s Global Ambassador for the Bonn Challenge, a global effort to restore 150 million hectares of the world&#x27;s degraded and deforested lands by 2020.

On 8 October 2010, she spoke at the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas (ASPO) 2010 world conference on moving beyond petroleum and &quot;Crimes against Present and Future Generations&quot;.

In June 2012, along with the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Airbus, Jagger launched an online campaign called the Plant a Pledge initiative, which aims to restore 150 million hectares of forest around the world by 2020.

On 21 November 2013, Jagger delivered the prestigious 12th annual Longford Lecture titled &quot;Ending Violence Against Women and Girls, and the Culture of Impunity: achieving the missing Millennium Development Goal target&quot;, chaired by Jon Snow.

Prior to the 2015 UK general election, she was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party&#x27;s Caroline Lucas.

<text>Lieutenant General Manton Sprague Eddy (May 16, 1892 – April 10, 1962) was a senior United States Army officer who served in both World War I and World War II. During the latter conflict he served with distinction, commanding the 9th Infantry Division and later the XII Corps in the campaign in Western Europe, playing a large part in the Battle of the Bulge in late December 1944, leading the corps until April 20, 1945, when health problems forced him to turn over command.

==Early life and military career==
Eddy graduated from Shattuck Military School in Faribault, Minnesota, in 1913. He enlisted in the Infantry Branch of the United States Army in 1916 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant of infantry in early 1918, a few months after the American entry into World War I the previous April. With the rank of captain, he was a company commander in the 11th Machine Gun Battalion, part of the 4th Division of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). He was sent to the Western Front with his division in May 1918 but was wounded in the leg in August, when the tide of the war had turned against the Germans. He recovered soon after and commanded a machine gun battalion until the end of the war on November 11, 1918.

==Between the wars==
Promoted to the wartime rank of major, Eddy served in Allied-occupied Germany until 1919 when he returned to the United States. Relegated to the rank of captain in the Regular Army in 1920, Eddy married Mamie Peabody Buttolph in 1921. During the period between the wars, he was a member of the Infantry Board and was a student, later an instructor, at both the United States Army Infantry School and the United States Army Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He also served as Professor of Military Science and Tactics at Riverdale Military Academy. While at the Infantry School, he met George C. Marshall, the future Army Chief of Staff, who was impressed with Eddy.

By 1940, Eddy was an intelligence officer with III Corps. In 1941 Eddy assumed command of the 114th Infantry Regiment, part of the 44th Infantry Division, a National Guard formation.

==World War II==
In March 1942, three months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent American entry into World War II, Eddy was promoted to the one-star general officer rank of brigadier general on March 24, 1942, and became the assistant division commander (ADC) of the 9th Infantry Division. On August 8, he was promoted to the two-star rank of major general and succeeded Major General Rene Edward De Russy Hoyle as Commanding General of the 9th Infantry Division, a Regular Army formation, while Brigadier General Donald A. Stroh succeeded Eddy as the 9th&#x27;s ADC.

After training in the United States for several months Eddy led the division overseas, landing in French North Africa on November 8, 1942, as part of Operation Torch. The 9th Division fought in the subsequent Allied campaign in North Africa, and played a large role in the Battle of Kasserine Pass in February 1943. The campaign came to an end in May 1943, with the surrender of almost 250,000 Axis soldiers.

Eddy later led the 9th Division in Operation Husky, codename for the Allied invasion of Sicily, in August 1943. In November the 9th Division was sent to England in preparation for the Allied invasion of Northern France, scheduled for the spring of 1944.

Eddy led the 9th Division in the early stages of Operation Overlord, codename for the Battle of Normandy, landing on Utah Beach four days after the D-Day landings of June 6, 1944. For his role in the capture of the French port of Cherbourg, which much impressed his superiors, Eddy was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. In the opinion of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Eddy had outperformed all the other American divisional commanders in Normandy, and he had slated Eddy to take over the next available corps.

In August he became Commanding General of XII Corps, which was often the spearhead of Lieutenant General George S. Patton&#x27;s Third Army. Eddy led XII Corps in the Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine and in the subsequent fighting on the Western Front. During the Battle of the Bulge, Eddy&#x27;s XII Corps successfully held the southern shoulder of the German salient. In April 1945, after taking part in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, shortly before the end of World War II in Europe, Eddy returned to the United States due to a severe illness (extreme hypertension, from which he eventually recovered) and was replaced in command of XII Corps by Major General Stafford LeRoy Irwin.

==Postwar==
In the postwar period, Eddy served again at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, this time as Commandant of the United States Army Command and General Staff College, from January 1948 to July 1950. He was president of a review board that made a thorough examination of officer education and established the progressive branch, staff, and senior service levels of officer schooling. As commander of the Seventh Army, he presided over its transformation from an army of occupation to one of deterrence. Eddy retired from the army with the rank of lieutenant general.

Eddy died in Columbus, Georgia on April 10, 1962, at the age of 69. Eddy is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia.

<text>Max Karl Wilhelm von Gallwitz (2 May 1852 – 18 April 1937) was a German general from Breslau (Wrocław), Silesia, who served with distinction during World War I on both the Eastern and Western Fronts.

==Biography==
Gallwitz grew up in a Catholic family in Breslau and joined the Prussian Army in 1870. In 1891, he married Friedrike. They had a daughter and son Werner, who became a lieutenant general in the Second World War. Gallwitz was a First World War corps commander (Guards Reserve Corps) on the Western Front, but he was almost immediately transferred east to join the Eighth Army under Hindenburg. In 1915, he took command of &quot;Armee-Gruppe&quot; Gallwitz (later redesignated Twelfth Army) and participated in the Galicia offensive alongside Mackensen, who commanded the Eleventh Army.

Towards the end of 1915, Gallwitz succeeded Mackensen as commander of the Eleventh Army, as the latter campaigned against Serbia. In 1916, he moved back to the Western Front and defended against the British attack in the Battle of the Somme. He took over command of 2nd Army and of &quot;Heeresgruppe&quot; Gallwitz - Somme controlling the 1st and 2nd Armies. From 1916–18, he commanded the Fifth Army in the west, most notably engaging the Americans during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel.

Following his retirement from the army, Gallwitz served as a deputy in the Reichstag (1920–24) for the German National People&#x27;s Party.

==Awards and decorations==
* Pour le Mérite (24 July 1915), Oak Leaves added on 28 September 1915

<text>The FIFA Club World Cup is an international men&#x27;s association football competition organised by the &quot;Fédération Internationale de Football Association&quot; (FIFA), the sport&#x27;s global governing body. The competition was first contested in 2000 as the FIFA Club World Championship. It was not held from 2001 to 2004 due to a combination of factors, chiefly the collapse of FIFA&#x27;s marketing partner International Sport and Leisure (ISL). It returned in 2005 as an annual competition through 2023. Following the 2023 edition, the tournament was again revamped to a quadrennial competition starting in 2025. The Cup&#x27;s prestige and stature have been subject to significant debate.

The first FIFA Club World Championship took place in Brazil in 2000, during which year it ran in parallel with the Intercontinental Cup, a competition played by the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the Copa Libertadores, with the champions of each tournament both retroactively recognised by FIFA as club world champions in 2017. In 2005, the Intercontinental Cup was merged with the FIFA Club World Championship, and in 2006, the tournament was renamed as the FIFA Club World Cup. The winner of the Club World Cup receives the FIFA Club World Cup trophy and a FIFA World Champions certificate.

The new format, which will come into effect with the 2025 edition, features 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation; 12 teams from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from Asia, 4 from Africa, 4 from North, Central America and Caribbean, 1 from Oceania, and 1 team from the host nation. The teams are drawn into eight groups of four, with each team playing three group stage matches in a round-robin format. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage, starting with the round of 16 and culminating with the final.

Real Madrid hold the record for most titles, having won the competition on five occasions. Corinthians&#x27; inaugural victory remains the best result from a host nation&#x27;s national league champions. Teams from Spain have won the tournament eight times, the most for any nation. England has the largest number of winning teams, with four clubs having won the tournament. The current world champions are Manchester City, who defeated Fluminense 4–0 in the 2023 final.

==History==

===Origin===

The first club tournament to be billed as the Football World Championship was held in 1887, in which FA Cup winners Aston Villa beat Scottish Cup winners Hibernian, the winners of the only national competitions at the time. The first time when the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3. Ironically, the Sunderland lineup in the 1895 World Championship consisted entirely of Scottish players – Scottish players who moved to England to play professionally in those days were known as the Scotch Professors.

The first attempt at creating a global club football tournament, according to FIFA, was in 1909, 21 years before the first FIFA World Cup. The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy was held in Italy in 1909 and 1911, and contested by English, Italian, German and Swiss clubs. English amateur team West Auckland won on both occasions.

The idea that FIFA should organise international club competitions dates from the beginning of the 1950s. In 1951, the Brazilian FA created &quot;Copa Rio&quot;, also called &quot;World Champions Cup&quot; in Brazil, with a view to being a Club World Cup (a &quot;club version&quot; of the FIFA World Cup). FIFA president Jules Rimet was asked about FIFA&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Copa Rio&quot;, and stated that it was not under FIFA&#x27;s jurisdiction since it was organised and sponsored by the Brazilian FA. FIFA board officials Stanley Rous and Ottorino Barassi participated personally, albeit not as FIFA assignees, in the organisation of Copa Rio in 1951. Rous&#x27; role was the negotiations with European clubs, whereas Barassi did the same and also helped form the framework of the competition. The Italian press regarded the competition as an &quot;impressive project&quot; that &quot;was greeted so enthusiastically by FIFA officials Stanley Rous and Jules Rimet to the extent of almost giving it an official FIFA stamp.&quot; Because of the difficulty the Brazilian FA found in bringing European clubs to the competition, the &quot;O Estado de S. Paulo&quot; newspaper suggested that there should be FIFA involvement in the programming of international club competitions saying that, &quot;ideally, international tournaments, here or abroad, should be played with a schedule set by FIFA&quot;. Palmeiras beat Juventus at Maracanã with over 200,000 spectators in attendance at the final of the 1951 Copa Rio, and were hailed as the first ever Club World Champions by the whole Brazilian press. However, as a number of European clubs declined participation in Copa Rio and their berths were given to less renowned ones, the quality of the eventually participating clubs was criticised in the Brazilian press, therefore the Brazilian FA announced that the following editions of Copa Rio were not to be hailed as a World Champions Cup but only as Copa Rio, and thus the second edition of the cup, won by Fluminense in 1952, was hailed as a World Champions Cup by a minority of the Brazilian press, having Copa Rio been extinguished by the Brazilian FA soon later, and replaced with another cup, won in 1953 by Vasco da Gama.

Still in the 1950s, the &quot;Pequeña Copa del Mundo&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Small World Cup&quot;) was a tournament held in Venezuela between 1952 and 1957, with some other club tournaments held in Caracas from 1958 onwards also often referred to by the name of the original 1952–1957 tournament. It was usually played by four participants, with two from Europe and two from South America.

In 1960, FIFA authorised the International Soccer League, created along the lines of the 1950s Copa Rio, with a view to creating a Club World Cup, with ratification from Stanley Rous, who then had become FIFA president. In the same year, the Intercontinental Cup rose to existence.

===The Intercontinental Cup and early proposals for a FIFA Club World Cup===

The &quot;Tournoi de Paris&quot; was a competition initially meant to bring together the top teams from Europe and South America; it was first played in 1957 when Vasco da Gama, the Rio de Janeiro champions, beat European champions Real Madrid 4–3 in the final at the Parc des Princes. The match was the first ever hailed as the &quot;best of Europe X best of South American&quot; club match, as it was Real Madrid&#x27;s first intercontinental competition as European champions (the Madrid team played the 1956 &quot;Pequeña Copa del Mundo&quot;, but confirmed their participation in the Venezuelan tournament before becoming European champions). In 1958, Real Madrid declined to participate in the Paris competition claiming that the final of the 1957–58 European Cup was just five days after the Paris Tournoi. On 8 October 1958, the Brazilian FA President João Havelange announced, at a UEFA meeting he attended as an invitee, the decision to create the &quot;best of Europe X best of South American&quot; club contest with endorsement from UEFA and CONMEBOL: the Copa Libertadores, the CONMEBOL-endorsed South American equivalent of the UEFA-endorsed European Cup, and the Intercontinental Cup, the latter being a UEFA/CONMEBOL-endorsed &quot;best club of the world&quot; contest between the champion clubs of both confederations.

Real Madrid won the first Intercontinental Cup in 1960, titled themselves &quot;world champions&quot; until FIFA stepped in and objected; citing that the competition did not grant the right to attempt participation to any other champions from outside Europe and South America, FIFA stated that they can only claim to be intercontinental champions of a competition played between two continental organisations (&quot;in contrast to the Intercontinental Cup, the right to attempt participation at the FIFA World Cup, through FIFA invitation in 1930 and qualification process since 1934, was open to every FIFA member-country, regardless of the continent where it was located&quot;). FIFA stated that they would prohibit the 1961 edition to be played out unless the organisers regarded the competition as a friendly or a private match between two organisations.

The Intercontinental Cup attracted the interest of other continents. The North and Central America confederation, CONCACAF, was created in 1961 in order to, among other reasons, try to include its clubs in the Copa Libertadores and, by extension, the Intercontinental Cup. However, their entry into both competitions was rejected. Subsequently, the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup began in 1962.

Due to the brutality of the Argentine and Uruguayan clubs at the Intercontinental Cup, FIFA was asked several times during the late 1960s to assess penalties and regulate the tournament. However, FIFA refused each request. The first of these requests was made in 1967, after a play-off match labelled &quot;The Battle of Montevideo&quot;. The Scottish Football Association, via President Willie Allan, wanted FIFA to recognise the competition in order to enforce football regulation; FIFA responded that it could not regulate a competition it did not organise. Allan&#x27;s crusade also suffered after CONMEBOL, with the backing of its President Teofilo Salinas and the Argentine Football Association (&quot;Asociación del Fútbol Argentino&quot;; AFA), refused to allow FIFA to have any hand in the competition stating:


René Courte, FIFA&#x27;s General Sub-Secretary, wrote in 1967 an article shortly afterwards stating that FIFA viewed the Intercontinental Cup as a &quot;European-South American friendly match&quot;. This was confirmed by FIFA president Stanley Rous. With the Asian and North American club competitions in place in 1967, FIFA opened the idea of supervising the Intercontinental Cup if it included those confederations, with Stanley Rous saying that CONCACAF and the Asian Football Confederation had requested in 1967 participation of their champions in the Intercontinental Cup; the proposal was met with a negative response from UEFA and CONMEBOL. The 1968 and 1969 Intercontinental Cups finished in similarly violent fashion, with Manchester United manager Matt Busby insisting that &quot;the Argentineans should be banned from all competitive football. FIFA should really step in.&quot; In 1970, the FIFA Executive Committee proposed the creation of a multicontinental Club World Cup, not limited to Europe and South America but including also the other confederations; the idea did not go forward due to UEFA resistance.

In 1973, French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot;, who helped bring about the birth of the European Cup, volunteered to sponsor a Club World Cup contested by the champions of Europe, South America, North America and Africa, the only continental club tournaments in existence at the time; the competition was to potentially take place in Paris between September and October 1974, with an eventual final to be held at the &quot;Parc des Princes&quot;. The extreme negativity of the Europeans prevented this from happening. The same newspaper tried once again in 1975 to create a Club World Cup, in which participants would have been the four semi-finalists of the European Cup, both finalists of the Copa Libertadores, as well as the African and Asian champions; once more, the proposal was to no avail. UEFA, via its president, Artemio Franchi, declined once again and the proposal failed. The idea for a multicontinental, FIFA-endorsed Club World Cup was also endorsed by João Havelange in his campaigning for FIFA presidency in 1974. The Mexican clubs América and Pumas UNAM, and the Mexican Football Association, demanded participation in the Intercontinental Cup (&quot;either as the American-continent representantives in the Intercontinental Cup or as part of a UEFA-CONMEBOL-CONCACAF new Intercontinental Cup&quot;) after winning the 1977–78 and 1980–81 editions of the Interamerican Cup against the South American champions; the request was unsuccessful.

The 1970s saw no fewer than seven occasions in which the European champions relinquished participating at the Intercontinental Cup, resulting in either the participation of the European Cup runners-up or the cancellation of the event; thus, with the Intercontinental Cup in danger of being dissolved, West Nally, a British marketing company, was hired by UEFA and CONMEBOL to find a viable solution in 1980; Toyota Motor Corporation, via West Nally, took the competition under its wing and rebranded it as the &quot;Toyota Cup&quot;, a one-off match played in Japan. Toyota invested over US$700,000 in the 1980 edition to take place in Tokyo&#x27;s National Olympic Stadium, with over US$200,000 awarded to each participant. The Toyota Cup, with its new format, was received with scepticism, as the sport was unfamiliar in the Far East. However, the financial incentive was welcomed, as European and South American clubs were suffering financial difficulties. To protect themselves against the possibility of European withdrawals, Toyota, UEFA and every European Cup participant signed annual contracts requiring the eventual winners of the European Cup to participate at the Intercontinental Cup, as a condition UEFA stipulated to the clubs&#x27; participation in the European Cup, or risk facing an international lawsuit from UEFA and Toyota. For instance, Barcelona, the winners of the 1991–92 European Cup, considered not participating in the Intercontinental Cup in 1992, and the aforementioned contractual obligation weighed in for their decision to play. In 1983, the English Football Association tried organising a Club World Cup to be played in 1985 and sponsored by West Nally, only to be denied by UEFA.

===Inauguration (2000–2001)===

The framework of the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship was laid years in advance. According to Sepp Blatter, the idea of the tournament was presented to the executive committee in December 1993 in Las Vegas, United States by Silvio Berlusconi, AC Milan&#x27;s president. Since every confederation had, by then, a stable, continental championship, FIFA felt it was prudent and relevant to have a Club World Championship tournament. Initially, there were nine candidates to host the competition: China, Brazil, Mexico, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Tahiti, Turkey, the United States and Uruguay; of the nine, only Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Brazil and Uruguay confirmed their interest to FIFA. On 7 June 1999, FIFA selected Brazil to host the competition, which was initially scheduled to take place in 1999. Manchester United legend Bobby Charlton, a pillar of England&#x27;s victorious campaign in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, stated that the Club World Championship provided &quot;a fantastic chance of becoming the first genuine world champions.&quot; The competition gave away US$28 million in prize money and its TV rights, worth US$40 million, were sold to 15 broadcasters across five continents. The final draw of the first Club World Championship was done on 14 October 1999 at the Copacabana Palace Hotel in Rio de Janeiro.
The inaugural competition was planned to be contested in 1999 by the continental club winners of 1998, the Intercontinental Cup winners and the host nation&#x27;s national club champions, but it was postponed by one year. When it was rescheduled, the competition had eight new participants from the continental champions of 1999: Brazilian clubs Corinthians and Vasco da Gama, English side Manchester United, Mexican club Necaxa, Moroccan club Raja CA, Spanish side Real Madrid, Saudi club Al-Nassr, and Australian club South Melbourne. The first goal of the competition was scored by Real Madrid&#x27;s Nicolas Anelka against Al-Nassr; Real Madrid went on to win the match 3–1. The final was an all-Brazilian affair, as well as the only one which saw one side have home advantage. Vasco da Gama could not take advantage of its local support, being beaten by Corinthians 4–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw in 90 minutes and extra time.

The second edition of the competition was planned for Spain in 2001, and would have featured 12 clubs. The draw was performed at A Coruña on 6 March 2001. However, it was cancelled on 18 May, due to a combination of factors, most importantly the collapse of FIFA&#x27;s marketing partner International Sport and Leisure. The participants of the cancelled edition received US$750,000 each in compensation; the &quot;Real Federación Española de Fútbol&quot; (RFEF) also received US$1 million from FIFA. Another attempt to stage the competition in 2003, in which 17 countries were looking to be the host nation, also failed to happen. FIFA agreed with UEFA, CONMEBOL and Toyota to merge the Intercontinental Cup and Club World Championship into one event. The final Intercontinental Cup, played by representatives clubs of most developed continents in the football world, was in 2004, with a relaunched Club World Championship held in Japan in December 2005. All the winning teams of the Intercontinental Cup were regarded by worldwide mass media and football&#x27;s community as &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;world champions&quot; until 2017 when FIFA officially (&quot;de jure&quot;) recognised all of them as official club world champions in equal status to the FIFA Club World Cup winners.

===Knock-out tournaments (2005–2023)===

The 2005 version was shorter than the previous World Championship, reducing the problem of scheduling the tournament around the different club seasons across each continent. It contained just the six reigning continental champions, with the CONMEBOL and UEFA representatives receiving byes to the semi-finals. A new trophy was introduced replacing the Intercontinental trophy, the Toyota trophy and the trophy of 2000. The draw for the 2005 edition of the competition took place in Tokyo on 30 July 2005 at The Westin Tokyo. The 2005 edition saw São Paulo pushed to the limit by Saudi side Al-Ittihad to reach the final. In the final, one goal from Mineiro was enough to dispatch English club Liverpool; Mineiro became the first player to score in a Club World Cup final.

Internacional defeated defending World and South American champions São Paulo in the 2006 Copa Libertadores Finals in order to qualify for the 2006 tournament. At the semi-finals, Internacional beat Egyptian side Al Ahly in order to meet Barcelona in the final. A late goal from Adriano Gabiru kept the trophy in Brazil. It was in 2007 when Brazilian hegemony was finally broken: AC Milan won a close match against Japan&#x27;s Urawa Red Diamonds, who were pushed by over 67,000 fans at Yokohama&#x27;s International Stadium, and won 1–0 to reach the final. In the final, Milan crushed Boca Juniors 4–2, in a match that saw the first player sent off in a Club World Cup final: Milan&#x27;s Kakha Kaladze from Georgia in the 77th minute. Eleven minutes later, Boca Junior&#x27;s Pablo Ledesma would join Kaladze as he too was sent off. The following year, Manchester United would emulate Milan by beating their semi-final opponents, Japan&#x27;s Gamba Osaka, 5–3. They saw off Ecuadorian club LDU Quito 1–0 to become world champions in 2008.

United Arab Emirates successfully applied for the right to host the FIFA Club World Cup in 2009 and 2010. Barcelona dethroned World and European champions Manchester United in the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final to qualify for the 2009 Club World Cup. Barcelona beat Mexican club Atlante in the semi-finals 3–1 and met Estudiantes in the final. After a very close encounter which saw the need for extra-time, Lionel Messi scored from a header to snatch victory for Barcelona and complete an unprecedented sextuple. The 2010 edition saw the first non-European and non-South American side to reach the final: TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of Congo defeated Brazil&#x27;s Internacional 2–0 in the semi-final to face Internazionale, who beat South Korean club Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma 3–0 to reach the final. Internazionale went on to beat Mazembe with the same scoreline to complete their quintuple.

The FIFA Club World Cup returned to Japan for the 2011 and 2012 editions. In 2011, Barcelona comfortably won their semi-final match 4–0 against Qatari club Al Sadd. In the final, Barcelona won against Santos by the same scoreline for their second title. Messi also became the first player to score in two different Club World Cup finals. The 2012 edition saw Europe&#x27;s dominance come to an end as Corinthians, boasting over 30,000 travelling fans which was dubbed the &quot;Invasão da Fiel&quot;, travelled to Japan to join Barcelona in being two-time winners of the competition. In the semi-finals, Al-Ahly managed to keep the scoreline close as Corinthians&#x27; Paolo Guerrero scored to send the &quot;Timão&quot; into their second final. Guerrero would once again come through for Corinthians as the &quot;Timão&quot; saw off English side Chelsea 1–0 in order to bring the trophy back to Brazil.
2013 and 2014 had the Club World Cup moving to Morocco. The first edition saw a Cinderella run of host team Raja CA, who had to start in the play-off round and became the second African team to reach the final, after defeating Brazil&#x27;s Atlético Mineiro in the semi-final. Like Mazembe, Raja also lost to the European champion, this time a 2–0 defeat to Bayern Munich. 2014 again had a decision between South America and Europe, and Real Madrid beat San Lorenzo 2–0.

The 2015 and 2016 editions once again saw Japan as hosts for the 7th and 8th time respectively in the 12th and 13th editions of the FIFA Club World Cup. The 2015 edition saw a final between River Plate and FC Barcelona. FC Barcelona lifted their third FIFA Club World Cup, with Suarez scoring two goals and Lionel Messi scoring one goal in the final. One notable thing that occurred in the 2015 tournament was that Sanfrecce Hiroshima finished in third place, the best result achieved by a Japanese club at the time. This record would not last though, as the 2016 edition saw J1 League winners Kashima Antlers making it to the final against Real Madrid. A Gaku Shibasaki inspired Kashima attempted to win their first FIFA Club World Cup (a feat never done by any club outside of Europe and South America), but were denied by Real Madrid, who won 4–2 in extra time, thanks to a hat-trick by Cristiano Ronaldo.

The UAE returned to host the event in 2017 and 2018. 2017 involved the likes of Real Madrid becoming the first team in Club World Cup history to return to the tournament to defend their title. Real Madrid became the first team to successfully defend their title after defeating Grêmio in the Final, all while eliminating Al Jazira in the Semi-Finals. Al-Ain was the first Emirati team to reach the Club World Cup final, as well as the second Asian team to reach the final in the 2018 edition. Real Madrid defeated Al-Ain 4–1 in the final, to win their fourth title in the competition and to become the first team ever to win it three years in a row and four times in total in the tournament&#x27;s history. Thus, Real Madrid extended their international titles to seven after winning the 2018 edition (counting their three Intercontinental Cup titles and four Club World Cup titles).

On 3 June 2019, FIFA selected Qatar as the host of both the 2019 and 2020 events. Gonzalo Belloso, the Deputy Secretary General and development director of CONMEBOL, previously said that the 2019 and 2020 editions will be held in Japan. The 2019 edition saw Liverpool defeat Flamengo to win the competition for the first time. In the 2020 edition, Bayern Munich beat Tigres UANL 1–0, completing their sextuple. The 2021 tournament was won by Chelsea, who defeated Palmeiras 2–1 after extra time for their first title.

===Expansion===
In late 2016, FIFA President Gianni Infantino suggested an expansion of the Club World Cup to 32 teams beginning in 2019 and the reschedule to June to be more balanced and more attractive to broadcasters and sponsors. In late 2017, FIFA discussed proposals to expand the competition to 24 teams and have it be played every four years by 2021, replacing the FIFA Confederations Cup.

The new tournament with 24 teams was supposed to start in 2021 and would have included all UEFA Champions League winners, UEFA Champions League runners-up, UEFA Europa League winners, and Copa Libertadores winners from the four seasons up to and including the year of the event, with the remainder qualifying from the other four confederations. Along with a new UEFA Nations League competition, revenues of $25 billion would be expected during the period from 2021 to 2033. The first tournament would have been played in China; however, the tournament was cancelled due to scheduling issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 16 December 2022, FIFA announced an expanded tournament that would have 32 teams and start in June 2025. The International Federation of Professional Footballers and World Leagues Forum both immediately criticized the proposal. On 23 June 2023, FIFA confirmed that the United States will host the 2025 tournament as a prelude to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The 32 teams will be divided into 8 groups of 4 teams with the top 2 teams in each group qualifying to the knockout stage. The FIFA Council also unanimously approved the concept of an annual club competition from 2024, called the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, in response to the fact that the FIFA Club World Cup was last held in its previous guise in 2023.

The format of the tournament has caused controversy, with many clubs and national associations opposing its scheduling and accusing FIFA of prioritizing money over players&#x27; health, arguing that the addition of the new FIFA Intercontinental Cup could lead to competition overload and put players&#x27; health at risk.

Africa&#x27;s best representatives were TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Moroccan club Raja CA, which finished second in 2010 and 2013, respectively. Asia&#x27;s best representatives were Kashima Antlers from Japan, Al-Ain from the United Arab Emirates and Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia, finishing second in 2016, 2018 and 2022, respectively. North America&#x27;s best result was Mexican team Tigres UANL, which earned a second-place finish in 2020. These six clubs are the only sides from outside Europe and South America to reach the final.

Auckland City from New Zealand earned third place in 2014, the only time to date that an Oceanian team reached the semi-finals of the tournament.

==Format and rules==
As of 2022, most teams qualify to the FIFA Club World Cup by winning their continental competitions, be it the AFC Champions League, CAF Champions League, CONCACAF Champions League, Copa Libertadores, OFC Champions League or UEFA Champions League. Aside from these, the host nation&#x27;s national league champions qualify as well.

The maiden edition of this competition was separated into two rounds. The eight participants were split into two groups of four teams. The winner of each group met in the final while the runners-up played for third place. The competition changed its format during the 2005 relaunch into a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shoot-outs used to decide the winner if necessary. It featured six clubs competing over a two-week period. There were three stages: the quarter-final round, the semi-final round and the final. The quarter-final stage pitted the Oceanian Champions League winners, the African Champions League winners, the Asian Champions League winners and the North American Champions League winners against each other. Afterwards, the winners of those games would go on to the semi-finals to play the European Champions League winners and South America&#x27;s Copa Libertadores winners. The victors of each semi-final would play go on to play in the final.

With the introduction of this format, a fifth place match and a spot for the host nation&#x27;s national league champions were added. There are now four stages: the play-off round, the quarter-final round, the semi-final round and the final. The first stage pits the host nation&#x27;s national league champions against the Oceanian Champions League winners. The winner of that stage would go on the quarter-finals to join the African Champions League winners, the AFC Champions League winners and the CONCACAF Champions League winners. The winners of those games would go on to the semi-finals to play the UEFA Champions League winners and South America&#x27;s Copa Libertadores winners. The winners of each semi-final play each other in the final.

Starting from 2022, the match for fifth place is no longer played.

==Trophy==

The trophy used during the inaugural competition was called the &quot;FIFA Club World Championship&quot; Cup. The original laurel was created by Sawaya &amp; Moroni, an Italian designer company that produces contemporary designs with cultural backgrounds and design concepts. The designing firm is based in Milan. The fully silver-coloured trophy had a weight of and a height of . Its base and widest points are long. The trophy had a base of two pedestals which had four rectangular pillars. Two of the four pillars had inscriptions on them; one contained the phrase, &quot;FIFA Club World Championship&quot; imprinted across. The other had the letters &quot;FIFA&quot; inscribed on it. On top, a football based on the 1998 FIFA World Cup ball, the Adidas Tricolore, can be seen. The production costs of the laurel was US$25,000. It was presented for the first time at Sheraton Hotels and Resorts in Rio de Janeiro on 4 January 2000.
The tournament, in its second format, shared its name with the second trophy, also called the &quot;FIFA Club World Cup&quot; or simply &quot;la Copa&quot;, which was awarded to the FIFA Club World Cup winner. It was unveiled at Tokyo on 30 July 2005 during the draw of that year&#x27;s edition of the competition. The laurel was designed in 2005 in Birmingham, United Kingdom, at Thomas Fattorini Ltd, by English designer Jane Powell, alongside her assistant Dawn Forbes, at the behest of FIFA. The gold-and-silver-coloured trophy, weighing , had a height of . Its base and widest points were also measured at exactly . It was made out of a combination of brass, copper, sterling silver, gilding metal, aluminium, chrome and rhodium. The trophy itself was gold plated.

The design, according to FIFA, showed six staggered pillars, representing the six participating teams from the respective six confederations, and one separate metal structure referencing the winner of the competition. They held up a globe in the shape of a football – a consistent feature in almost all of FIFA&#x27;s trophies. The golden pedestal had the phrase, &quot;FIFA Club World Cup&quot;, imprinted at the bottom.

As part of the expansion of the tournament to 32 teams, a new trophy was created in collaboration with global luxury jeweller Tiffany &amp; Co. and unveiled on 14 November 2024. The new trophy features a 24-carat gold-plated finish, intricate laser-engraved inscriptions on both sides including a world map and the names of all 211 FIFA member associations and the six confederations, icons that capture football&#x27;s traditions, including symbols of stadiums and equipment, and engravings in 13 languages and braille. Space is available to laser-engrave the emblems of the winning clubs for 24 editions of the tournament. The trophy can transform from a shield into a multifaceted and orbital structure. The design was inspired by the Voyager Golden Records. 

==Awards==

At the end of each Club World Cup, awards are presented to the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team positions in the tournament. There are currently three awards:
*The Golden Ball for the best player, determined by a vote of media members, who is also awarded the Alibaba Cloud Award (the presenting sponsor of the FIFA Club World Cup); the Silver Ball and the Bronze Ball are awarded to the players finishing second and third in the voting respectively.
*The Player of the Match (formerly known as the &quot;Man of the Match&quot;) for the best performing player in each tournament match. It was first awarded in 2013.
*The FIFA Fair Play Trophy for the team with the best fair play record, according to the points system and criteria established by the FIFA Fair Play Committee.

The winners of the competition are also entitled to receive the FIFA Champions Badge; it features an image of the trophy, which the reigning champion is entitled to display on its first-team kit only, up until and including, the final of the next championship. The first edition of the badge was presented to Milan, the winners of the 2007 final. All four previous champions were allowed to wear the badge until the 2008 final, where Manchester United gained the sole right to wear the badge by winning the trophy.

Each tournament&#x27;s top three teams receives a set of gold, silver or bronze medals to distribute to their players.

==Prize money==

The 2000 FIFA Club World Championship was the inaugural edition of this competition; it provided US$28 million in prize money for its participants. The prize money received by the clubs participating was divided into fixed payments based on participation and results. Clubs finishing the tournament from fifth to eighth place received US$2.5 million. The club who would eventually finish in fourth place received US$3 million while the third-place team received US$4 million. The runner-up earned US$5 million while the eventual champions would gain US$6 million.

The relaunch of the tournament in 2005 FIFA Club World Championship saw different amounts of prize money given and some changes in the criteria of receiving certain amounts. The total amount of prize money given dropped to US$16 million. The winners received US$5 million and the runners-up US$4 million, with $2.5 million for third place, US$2 million for fourth, US$1.5 million for fifth and US$1 million for sixth.

For the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup, a play-off match between the OFC champions and the host-nation champions for entry into the quarter-final stage was introduced in order to increase home interest in the tournament. The reintroduction of the match for fifth place for the 2008 competition also prompted an increase in prize money by US$500,000 to a total of US$16.5 million.
==Sponsorship==
Like the FIFA World Cup, the FIFA Club World Cup is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations. Toyota Motor Corporation, a Japanese multinational automaker headquartered in Toyota, Aichi, was the Presenting Partner of the FIFA Club World Cup until its sponsorship agreement expired at the end of December 2014 and was not renewed.

In 2015, Alibaba Group signed an eight-year contract to become the Presenting Partner of the competition.

The inaugural competition had six event sponsors: Fujifilm, Hyundai, JVC, McDonald&#x27;s, Budweiser and MasterCard.

Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising, even if such sponsors conflict with those of the FIFA Club World Cup. However, only one main sponsor is permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer.

==Records and statistics==


Toni Kroos has won the FIFA Club World Cup six times, the most titles for any player. Cristiano Ronaldo is the overall top scorer in FIFA Club World Cup history, with seven goals. Hussein El Shahat has made the most appearances in the competition, with fifteen.

Real Madrid have won the FIFA Club World Cup a record five times. They also have the most wins (12) and most total goals scored in the competition (40). Auckland City have participated in the most editions of the tournament (11), while Al Ahly have played the most overall matches (25).

==Official songs==
Like most international football tournaments, the FIFA Club World Cup has featured official songs for each tournament since 2005.


== Reception ==
Since its inception in 2000, the competition, despite its name and the contestants&#x27; achievements, has received differing reception. In most of Europe it struggles to find broad media attention compared to the UEFA Champions League and commonly lacks recognition as a high-ranking contest. In South America, however, it is widely considered the highest point in the career of a footballer, coach and/or team at international club level.

The competition is also criticised, mainly by the European press and fans among others, for its format, which favours the UEFA and CONMEBOL teams, since their representatives start in the semi-finals and can only meet each other in the final match. The opening up of the global market in football has changed the balance. Nowadays, the best South Americans are usually playing for the European teams. FIFA&#x27;s decision to choose the competition&#x27;s host based on financial factors rather than footballing ones, as in the case of Qatar, has also been criticised. Additionally, the economic benefits to the winning team are considered inferior to any Super Cup prizes.

<text>Styal (, like &quot;style&quot;) is a village and civil parish in Cheshire, England; it is sited on the River Bollin. The village is located north-north-west of Wilmslow and south-east of Manchester Airport.

==History==

Styal village grew during the early years of the Industrial Revolution when industrialist Samuel Greg built Quarry Bank Mill, a cotton mill and textile factory. The mill was situated on the bank of the River Bollin in order to use the water current to power the waterwheels. By the 1820s, the mill was expanding and, because of its rural location, Greg found the need to construct a new model village nearby to provide housing for his workers.

Samuel Greg died in 1834 and Quarry Bank Mill was taken over by his son, Robert Hyde Greg, who remained in charge for nearly 40 years; he introduced a number of technological innovations. Ownership of the mill subsequently passed through several generations of the Greg Family. The mill ceased operation as a working factory in 1959.

In 1898, the Styal Cottage Homes were opened to house destitute children from the Manchester area; it closed in 1956. Today, the former buildings are occupied by the HMP Styal women&#x27;s prison, which opened in 1962.

==Landmarks==
Quarry Bank Mill and its village still stand today; it is now owned by National Trust, who operate it as an industrial heritage museum.

The mill and its surrounding buildings are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.

Quarry Bank Mill has been recognised internationally as a significant industrial heritage site; it has been included on the European Route of Industrial Heritage by the European Union&#x27;s Creative Europe programme, which records the mill, with Styal village, as &quot;The most complete and least altered factory colony of the Industrial Revolution. It is of outstanding national and international importance.&quot;

Norcliffe Chapel, a small Grade II-listed Unitarian chapel, stands close to the mill village. It was built in 1822–23 to provide a place of worship for the mill workers and is now in the ownership of the National Trust. It was originally established as a Baptist chapel, but was changed to a Unitarian church by Samuel Greg, himself a Unitarian, in 1833.

The Greg family were influential landowners in the area and, in 1831, Robert Hyde Greg commissioned the construction of a large new home, Norcliffe Hall, to the west of the village. Today, the Grade II-listed building is occupied by private flats.
Near to Norcliffe chapel stands the Grade II-listed Styal Cross, a wayside cross of medieval origin. The cross had originally stood at Cross Farm. In 1860, it was relocated by the son of Samuel Greg, Robert Hyde Greg, to Holly Lane. In 1980, it was demolished by a car crash. The remains of the lower part were rebuilt on the lane close to Styal in 1983 and, after a fundraising campaign, a replacement stone column and cross were added to the medieval base in 2010.

==Amenities==
Styal Primary School serves the village and is located on Altrincham Road, to the west.

The village is home to several sports clubs; they include Styal Cricket Club, Styal Golf Club, Wilmslow Albion Football Club, Wilmslow Hockey Club and Wilmslow Lacrosse Club.

<doc id="1248603" wikidata="Q3526998" url="?curid=1248603" title="Excision theorem">
<text>In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, the excision theorem is a theorem about relative homology and one of the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms. Given a topological space formula_1 and subspaces formula_2 and formula_3 such that formula_3 is also a subspace of formula_2, the theorem says that under certain circumstances, we can cut out (excise) formula_3 from both spaces such that the relative homologies of the pairs formula_7 into formula_8 are isomorphic.

This assists in computation of singular homology groups, as sometimes after excising an appropriately chosen subspace we obtain something easier to compute.
== Theorem ==

=== Statement === 
If formula_9 are as above, we say that formula_3 can be excised if the inclusion map of the pair formula_7 into formula_8 induces an isomorphism on the relative homologies: 

The theorem states that if the closure of formula_3 is contained in the interior of formula_2, then formula_3 can be excised.

Often, subspaces that do not satisfy this containment criterion still can be excised—it suffices to be able to find a deformation retract of the subspaces onto subspaces that do satisfy it.

=== Proof sketch ===
The proof of the excision theorem is quite intuitive, though the details are rather involved. The idea is to subdivide the simplices in a relative cycle in formula_8 to get another chain consisting of &quot;smaller&quot; simplices (this can be done using barycentric subdivision), and continuing the process until each simplex in the chain lies entirely in the interior of formula_2 or the interior of formula_18. Since these form an open cover for formula_1 and simplices are compact, we can eventually do this in a finite number of steps. This process leaves the original homology class of the chain unchanged (this says the subdivision operator is chain homotopic to the identity map on homology).
In the relative homology formula_20, then, this says all the terms contained entirely in the interior of formula_3 can be dropped without affecting the homology class of the cycle. This allows us to show that the inclusion map is an isomorphism, as each relative cycle is equivalent to one that avoids formula_3 entirely.

== Applications ==

=== Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms ===

The excision theorem is taken to be one of the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms.

=== Mayer–Vietoris sequences ===

The Mayer–Vietoris sequence may be derived with a combination of excision theorem and the long-exact sequence.

=== Suspension theorem for homology ===

The excision theorem may be used to derive the suspension theorem for homology, which says formula_23 for all formula_24, where formula_25 is the suspension of formula_1.

=== Invariance of dimension===
If nonempty open sets formula_27 and formula_28
are homeomorphic, then &quot;m&quot; = &quot;n&quot;. This follows from the excision theorem, the long exact sequence for the pair formula_29, and the fact that formula_30 deformation retracts onto a sphere.
In particular, formula_31 is not homeomorphic to formula_32 if formula_33.

<text>General William Morris Hoge (13 January 1894 – 29 October 1979) was a highly decorated senior United States Army officer who fought with distinction in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War, with a military career spanning nearly forty years.

==Early life and military career==
William M. Hoge was born on the campus of Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri, where his father William McGuffey Hoge served as principal. In 1905, the family moved to Lexington, Missouri, where his father bought an ownership interest and served as principal and superintendent at Wentworth Military Academy. After graduating from Wentworth in 1911 and taking a postgrad year in New York, he received an appointment to the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York. He graduated in June 1916, then was commissioned into the Engineer Branch of the United States Army. His fellow graduates were men such as Horace L. McBride, Stanley Eric Reinhart, Fay B. Prickett, Calvin DeWitt Jr., Dwight Johns, Wilhelm D. Styer and Robert Neyland. Hoge commanded a company of the 7th Engineer Regiment, 5th Division, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 1917 to 1918, during World War I.

During the war, Hoge served overseas in France, where he received the Distinguished Service Cross personally from General John J. Pershing, Commander-in-chief of the American Expeditionary Forces on the Western Front, for heroic action under fire as a battalion commander during the Meuse–Argonne offensive. The citation for his DSC reads:

He was also awarded the Silver Star, &quot;for gallantry in action&quot;, during the war.

During the interwar years, Hoge graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and from the United States Army Command and General Staff College.

==World War II==
Hoge directed one of the great engineering feats of World War II, the construction of the 1,519-mile (2,450 km) ALCAN Highway in nine months. Later, in Europe, he commanded the Provisional Engineer Special Brigade Group attached directly to V Corps (United States) in the assault on Omaha Beach. One of his key men who worked under him from Alaska to England, Colonel Benjamin B. Talley, directed the planning-specifics of the invasion, using maps, air studies, even tourist photos and postcards culled from the British people to learn the topography, and designate which units would assault which sectors of the two United States beaches. Talley went ashore at Omaha in the third wave to direct Engineer operations and immediately begin to receive men by the thousands and supplies by the ton over the beach from the Communications Zone, the supply and service-forces arm of the European Theater of Operations. Hoge later directed Combat Command B of the 9th Armored Division, in its heroic actions in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge, and in its celebrated capture of the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine River at Remagen. By war&#x27;s end, Hoge was the Commanding General of the 4th Armored Division.

==Post-World War II==
During the Korean War, at the request of General Matthew Ridgway, the Eighth United States Army commander, Hoge commanded the IX Corps in 1951. Hoge achieved his senior command in the army as commander-in-chief of United States Army Europe. Hoge was promoted to major general in May 1945, lieutenant general in June 1951, and full general on 23 October 1953.

Hoge retired from active duty in January 1955 to his hometown of Lexington, Missouri, then turned to the private sector as chairman of the board of Interlake Steel. Hoge moved to his son&#x27;s farm in Kansas in October 1975 and he died suddenly on 29 October 1979, at Munson Army Hospital, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==In popular culture==
In the 1969 film &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot;, the character of Brigadier General Shinner (played by E. G. Marshall) was based on Hoge.

==Awards and decorations==
His awards and decorations include:


Hoge Barracks, the transient housing operation at Fort Leavenworth, is named in his honor.
