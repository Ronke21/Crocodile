<text>Christian Island is a large island in Georgian Bay close to the communities of Penetanguishene and Midland, Ontario. The island, with its neighbours Hope Island and Beckwith Island, is a Ojibwa reserve, known as [[Christian Island 30, Ontario|Christian Island Indian Reserve No. 30]]. Together with the Christian Island Indian Reserve No. 30A located at Cedar Point, Ontario and the Chippewa Island Indian Reserve located in Twelve Mile Sound, north of Christian Island, it forms the land base for the Beausoleil First Nation. Christian Islands&#x27; highest elevation is above sea level.

To the east of Christian Island is Giants Tomb Island, part of Awenda Provincial Park, and Beausoleil Island, part of UNESCO&#x27;s Georgian Bay Biosphere Reserve (GBBR) and part of the Georgian Bay Islands National Park, consisting of 63 small islands in Georgian Bay, near Port Severn. UNESCO&#x27;s Georgian Bay Biosphere Reserve covers an area of that stretches along Georgian Bay&#x27;s eastern coast from Port Severn to the French River, and is the world&#x27;s largest freshwater archipelago – known as The Thirty Thousand Islands.

Together with other First Nations in the area, the Beausoleil have filed a land claim for lands situated between Matchedash Bay at Coldwater and the narrows at Lake Simcoe and Lake Couchiching. While the Chippewa Island reserve is shared among Beausoleil and two other First Nations, the two Christian Island reserves are not.

==Background==
Christian Island is primarily forest. The bedrock is limestone, and the soil is mainly sand, remnants of Glacial Lake Algonquin. A prehistoric species of grass, known as Forked three-awned grass or unofficially as &quot;Ice Age Grass,&quot; has been found on the Island. This is linked to its glacial beginnings. Forked three-awned grass is designated as a species at risk.

Originally, Christian Island was known by its Huron name &quot;Gahoendoe&quot;. The three islands were, in the 19th century, collectively known as the Christian Islands: Beckwith Island was called Faith Island, while Christian Island, which is the largest of the three, was known as Charity Island.

In 1649, thousands of Huron refugees and a few Jesuit missionaries from Sainte-Marie among the Hurons took refuge during the winter on the island during the Huron-Iroquois wars. The Jesuits called the island St. Joseph Island. With insufficient food, many of the First Nations people starved during the winter. The island&#x27;s occupation by Huron Catholics and Jesuits was the basis for its name of &quot;Christian&quot; Island. Specifically, it was named in honour of the Canadian Martyrs.

During their brief stay, the Jesuits constructed a small fort including a stone wall, a church, living quarters, a well and a stable. The Huron camp, consisting of over 100 cabins, was also fortified in the case of a potential siege. This collection of structures was termed Sainte-Marie II by archaeologists.

However, despite their attempts to clear the forest and plant crops, famine struck the group as winter descended, which historical evidence suggests, caused an outbreak of cannibalism. This was followed by an attack by the Iroquois in March of 1650. Facing increasingly hostile conditions, the Jesuits and most of the Huron refugees left the island and travelled to Quebec in the summer of 1650. The remaining Huron, along with the surviving remnants of the Petun, an Iroquoian group living at the base of the Niagara Escarpment near present-day Collingwood, left the island in 1651. The Petun had suffered serious losses in Iroquois raids in late 1649 and 1650. Their descendants eventually settled in the Detroit-Windsor area. Some were later forcibly resettled by U.S. authorities in Oklahoma.

Christian Island is inhabited by the Beausoleil First Nation. Their ancestors were nomadic, travelling from northern Georgian Bay and the United States around Lakes Huron and Michigan. The early Canadian government tried to assimilate First Nations peoples into the larger society. They encouraged the Beausoleil to give up their nomadic ways and settle at Coldwater in 1834-1842 as part of the Coldwater Narrows Reserve. Later the Natives were displaced to Beausoleil Island in 1842, and still later, were displaced to Christian Island in 1856, where they have remained.

The First Nation has tried various ways to generate income on the small reserve, including stocking the island with pheasants for hunting, a cattle operation, a charcoal operation, and a commercial fishery. A portion of lands are designated for cottage leasing. Today, many of the residents work on the mainland, and a growing community has sprung up on an annex of property at the Cedar Point landing. Hope and Beckwith islands are uninhabited, but are popular anchorage sites for boaters, who pay a small anchorage fee to the First Nation community.

The First Nation operates an elementary school, a health centre, and a community centre. 24-hour EMS service and a volunteer fire department operate year-round.

A ferry service connects the mainland at Cedar Point to Christian Island. A car ferry, the &quot;Sandy Graham&quot;, travels the strait between the Point and the Island on a regular schedule. Another ferry, the &quot;Indian Maiden&quot;, carries passengers only. It is capable of breaking ice up to 6&quot; thick. A hovercraft serves the island in case of emergency. At times of severe cold, the people build an ice road between the island and the mainland. As a result of the above average ice cover in February 2014 the ice road was opened.

Christian Island has a lighthouse that marks the southern tip of the island. It was used in the past for ships travelling from Collingwood to Penetanguishene, Midland, and Parry Sound. First lit in 1859, it is among the oldest lighthouses in Georgian Bay and one of the six Imperial Towers.

==Notable individuals==

Rodney Monague (1942–2013), a survivor of the Canadian Indian residential school system, was the island&#x27;s first chief after the departure of Indian agents in the 1960s. He served as chief for more than two decades, from the late 1960s until around 1990.

Canadian folk singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot penned a song about Christian Island in 1972 (Christian Island (Georgian Bay) which includes the lyric &quot;In the Lee of Christian Island&quot;), alluding to the popularity of the island as a sailing area.

==Shipwrecks ==
Christian Island is a favorite destination for scuba divers given the close proximity of a number of old shipwrecks (most going back a century or more) near Christian Island, and near the adjacent, uninhabited Hope Island. These include: Mapledawn (North West of Christian Island), steel freighter built in 1890 and sank 1924; Saucy Jim (East of Christian Island), sank 1910; gain vessel Michigan (North West of Hope Island), sank 1843; schooner Lottie Wolf (North East of Hope Island), sank 1879; and Marquette (East of Hope Island), sank 1867.

Lake Huron (in which Georgian Bay is located) is the final resting place to hundreds of other sunken vessels, many of them of great historic value. These shipwrecks are generally well preserved, owing to the cold, fresh water habitat.

==Ferry controversy==

On February 13, 2016, Canadian newspapers featured a story about the island&#x27;s 65-year-old ferry, the M.V. Sandy Graham, which was purchased by the government in 1998. First Nations residents believe the aging ferry, the islands&#x27; lifeline, must be replaced in the very near future. 
&quot;Our people have to cross day-to-day to get access to all the goods and services, as well as hospitals, medical appointments. I, in good conscience, can&#x27;t continue to sail this ferry knowing that tragedy could happen out on that water,&quot; Christian Island Chief Roly Monague said, according to the Canadian Press. The band council had put off regular maintenance of the ferry in an effort to ensure its replacement.

The ferry broke down again mid-summer, 2016, and after a lengthy repair period was brought back into operation in November 2016. It broke down again a few weeks later, leaving residents&#x27; cars stranded on the island or mainland. The Island&#x27;s official website (on November 25, 2016) states that: &quot;Due to a significant engine repair that is required, the M.V. Sandy Graham will be out of service for an indefinite period of time as of today. Updates will be posted as they arise but due to the damage to the engine, it will be a lengthy repair.&quot; 

As reported by Roger Klein of Barrie&#x27;s CTV News, Chief Mary McCue-King and Minister Carolyn Bennett held a meeting, brokered by the Beausoleil First Nation Youth Council, in January 2017.

&quot;The current vessel over 60 years old – it&#x27;s on its last legs. It&#x27;s going to break down and it&#x27;s going to be gone for good. We are going to be at a standstill pretty soon if we don&#x27;t come up with a solution pretty fast,&quot; Chief Mary McCue-King said at the meeting.

The new 26-30 car ferry, which will be able to break through the ice, will cost 23 million dollars plus 10 million dollars in upgrades to the dock.

&quot;The community is prepared to partner in order to have a new ferry, and we are obviously prepared to step up and do our part. And we know the province wants to do something as well. So we are going to make this happen,&quot; Minister Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, commented after the meeting.

The Beausoleil First Nation has committed to contributing 10 million dollars to the project.

==Governance==

In accordance with Indian Act election regulations, Beausoleil First Nation holds their general elections every two years. The June 23, 2018 election resulted in the following:

Chief: Guy Monague
Chief Councillor: Joanne Sandy
Councillor: Kristin Monague
Councillor: Lauraine Judith Jamieson 
Councillor: Hank Monague
Councillor: Angela Beedie
Councillor: C. Susan Copegog

Guy Monague won the general election, defeating former chief Roland Monague by 33 votes. He succeeded Mary McCue-King, who was elected in 2016 but did not seek reelection. McCue-King presently serves as the executive director of the Ogemawahj Tribal Council. The newly elected Chief and Council were sworn in on July 6, 2018.

Since November 2016, Terra Sandy Roy has served as Youth Chief, with Lance Copegog as Deputy Youth Chief.

<text>Arngrímur Jónsson the Learned (; 1568 – 27 June 1648) was an Icelandic scholar and a Christian apologist. His father was Jón Jónsson, who died in 1591. Arngrímur studied in Copenhagen, completing his studies in 1589 and taking up a position back in Iceland as rector of the Latin school at the episcopal seat of Hólar in the same year.

In 1593 he published &quot;Brevis commentarius de Islandia&quot;, a &quot;Defense of Iceland&quot; in Latin, in which he criticized the works of numerous authors who had written about the people and the country of Iceland. His main target was a poem by Gories Peerse, a merchant who had written an entertaining and somewhat slanderous poem about Icelandic geography and ethnography. Arngrímur also, however, criticized substantial works such as &quot;Cosmographia universalis&quot; of the German scholar Sebastian Münster.

The &quot;Brevis commentarius de Islandia&quot; was reprinted in 1598 in Richard Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Principal Navigations of the English Nation&quot;. This defense of Iceland and subsequent works were important for introducing European scholars to the ancient literature of Iceland and the richness of the manuscripts present there. In the context of the mounting conflicts between Denmark and Sweden, which saw both countries trying to establish historical precedents for their empire-building, it also played a formative role in the development of European nationalism, participating in the ethnographic insult and counterinsult by which European countries came to distinguish themselves in print. Through this and other writings–particularly his most important work, the &quot;Crymogæa&quot; of 1609–Arngrímur became an influential figure, inspiring leading Danish and Icelandic historians of subsequent generations, most prominently Ole Worm.

In his historical writings Arngrímur had access to texts no longer extant, most importantly a large fragment of &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; which was later lost completely. His works on legendary Danish and Swedish kings are the most important evidence for the contents of the lost saga. He also had in his possession for 40 or so years the Hauksbók manuscript, within which the only complete extant version of the Völuspa and the Hervararsaga ok Heidreks is featured, among a number of others. 

He is pictured on the now obsolete Icelandic 10 krónur banknote. See Icelandic króna.

<doc id="1238647" wikidata="Q6972000" url="?curid=1238647" title="National Crime Squad">
<text>The National Crime Squad (NCS) was a British police organisation which dealt with national and transnational organised and major crimes. Formed in April 1998 after the amalgamation of six former Regional Crime Squads, it merged with parts of HM Customs &amp; Excise and the National Criminal Intelligence Service on 1 April 2006 to become the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Subsequent to the Police Reform Act 2002, the NCS Service Authority reported directly to the Home Office and had nationwide and international jurisdiction. It did not handle security matters, referring such matters to the appropriate security service.

==Areas of focus==
The NCS primarily dealt with organised crime, major drug trafficking, contract killing, arms trafficking, human trafficking, computer and high tech crimes, money counterfeiting and laundering, extortion, kidnapping and murder relating to any of the above. Lastly, it augmented and supported regional forces throughout the United Kingdom.

==Organisation==
The organisation&#x27;s officers were seconded from police forces from England and Wales, supported by directly recruited specialist civilian and police staff members. It was headed by a director-general and had its own service authority. The first director-general was Roy Penrose, OBE QPM, and upon his retirement in 2001, William Hughes, CBE QPM became the director-general before moving on to establish the Serious Organised Crime Agency as its founding director-general. Trevor Pearce CBE QPM previously deputy director-general took over as the third director-general before becoming an executive director and later director-general of the Serious Organised Crime Agency.

The NCS headquarters was at Pimlico in London, with three Regional Operational Command Units: Northern, Eastern, and Western with an extensive residential property estate plus other premises. Other units were the Financial OCU, the Paedophilia Unit, the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit, and the Immigration Crime Team. The NCS consisted of 1,656 full-time personnel, including 5 Directors, 1,169 seconded police officers, and 280 civilian police staff.

==Appearances in fiction==
The NCS was fictionalised in the television series &quot;&quot;, and in &quot;Burnside&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;The Bill&quot;.

<text>The capuchin monkeys () are New World monkeys of the subfamily Cebinae. They are readily identified as the &quot;organ grinder&quot; monkey, and have been used in many movies and television shows. The range of capuchin monkeys includes some tropical forests in Central America and South America as far south as northern Argentina. In Central America, where they are called white-faced monkeys (&quot;carablanca&quot;), they usually occupy the wet lowland forests on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and Panama and deciduous dry forest on the Pacific coast.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;capuchin&quot; derives from the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, who wear brown robes with large hoods. When Portuguese explorers reached the Americas in the 15th century, they found small monkeys whose coloring resembled these friars, especially when in their robes with hoods down, and named them capuchins. When the scientists described a specimen (thought to be a golden-bellied capuchin) they noted that: &quot;his muzzle of a tanned color, ... with the lighter color around his eyes that melts into the white at the front, his cheeks ..., give him the looks that involuntarily reminds us of the appearance that historically in our country represents ignorance, laziness, and sensuality.&quot; The scientific name of the genus, &quot;Cebus&quot; comes from the Greek word&quot; kêbos&quot;, meaning a long-tailed monkey.

== Classification ==

The species-level taxonomy of this subfamily remains highly controversial, and alternative treatments than the one listed below have been suggested.

In 2011, Jessica Lynch Alfaro et al. proposed that the robust capuchins (formerly the &quot;C. apella&quot; group) be placed in a separate genus, &quot;Sapajus&quot;, from the gracile capuchins (formerly the &quot;C. capucinus&quot; group) which retain the genus &quot;Cebus&quot;. Other primatologists, such as Paul Garber, have begun using this classification.

According to genetic studies led by Lynch Alfaro in 2011, the gracile and robust capuchins diverged approximately 6.2 million years ago. Lynch Alfaro suspects that the divergence was triggered by the creation of the Amazon River, which separated the monkeys in the Amazon north of the Amazon River, who then evolved into the gracile capuchins. Those in the Atlantic Forest south of the river evolved into the robust capuchins. Gracile capuchins have longer limbs relative to their body size than robust capuchins, and have rounder skulls, whereas robust capuchins have jaws better adapted for opening hard nuts. Robust capuchins have crests and the males have beards.

* Rediscovered species.

The oldest known crown platyrrhine and member of Cebidae, &quot;Panamacebus transitus&quot;, is estimated to have lived 21 million years ago. It is the earliest known fossil evidence of a mammal travelling between South and North America.

== Physical characteristics ==

Capuchins are black, brown, buff or whitish, but their exact color and pattern depends on the species involved. Capuchin monkeys are usually dark brown with a cream/off-white coloring around their necks. They reach a length of , with tails that are just as long as the body. On average, they weigh from 1.4 to 4 kg (3 to 9 pounds) and live up to 25 years old in their natural habitats, and up to 35 in captivity.

== Habitat and distribution ==

Capuchins prefer environments that give them access to shelter and easy food, such as low-lying forests, mountain forests, and rain forests. They are particularly abundant in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Honduras, Paraguay, and Peru. They use these areas for shelter at night and food access during the day. The canopy of the trees allows for protection from threats above, and the capuchin monkeys&#x27; innate ability to climb trees with ease allows them to escape and hide from predators on the jungle floor. This environment is mutually beneficial for the capuchins and for the ecosystem in which they inhabit. This is because they spread their seed leftovers and fecal matter across the forest floor which helps new plants to grow, therefore adding to the already abundant foliage that shelters the capuchin.

== Behavior ==

Like most New World monkeys, capuchins are diurnal and arboreal. Capuchins are polygamous, and the females mate throughout the year, but only go through a gestation period once every 2 years between December and April. Females bear young every two years following a 160- to 180-day gestation. The young cling to their mother&#x27;s chest until they are larger, then they move to her back. Adult male capuchin rarely take part in caring for the young. Juveniles become fully mature within four years for females and eight years for males. In captivity, individuals have reached an age of 50 years, although natural life expectancy is only 15 to 25 years. Capuchins live in groups of 6–40 members, consisting of related females, their offspring, and several males.

=== Diet ===

The capuchin monkey feeds on a vast range of food types, and is more varied than other monkeys in the family Cebidae. They are omnivores, and consume a variety of plant parts such as leaves, flower and fruit, seeds, pith, woody tissue, sugarcane, bulb, and exudates, as well as arthropods, molluscs, a variety of vertebrates, and even primates. Recent findings of old stone tools in Capuchin habitats have suggested that recently the Capuchins have switched from small nuts, such as cashews, to larger and harder nuts. Capuchins have also been observed to be particularly good at catching frogs. They are characterized as innovative and extreme foragers because of their ability to acquire sustenance from a wide collection of unlikely food, which may assure their survival in habitats with extreme food limitation. Capuchins living near water will also eat crabs and shellfish by cracking their shells with stones.

=== Social structure ===

Capuchin monkeys often live in large groups of 10 to 35 individuals within the forest, although they can easily adapt to places colonized by humans. The Capuchins have discrete hierarchies that are distinguished by age and sex. Usually, a single male will dominate the group, and he will have primary rights to mate with the females of the group. However, the white-headed capuchin groups are led by both an alpha male and an alpha female. Each group will cover a large territory, since members must search for the best areas to feed. These primates are territorial animals, distinctly marking a central area of their territory with urine and defending it against intruders, though outer areas may overlap. The stabilization of group dynamics is served through mutual grooming, and communication occurs between the monkeys through various calls. Their vocal communications have various meanings such as creating contact with one another, warning about a predator, and forming new groups. The social experience of the capuchins directly influences the development of attention in society. They create new social behaviors within multiple groups that signify different types of interactions. These include; tests of friendship, displays against enemies, infant and sexual intimacy. This creates social rituals that are designed to test the strength of social bonds and a reliance on social learning.

=== Mating ===

Capuchin females often direct most of their proceptive and mating behavior towards the alpha male. However, when the female reaches the end of her proceptive period, she may sometimes mate with up to six different subordinate males in one day. Strictly targeting the alpha male does not happen every time, as some females have been observed to mate with three to four different males. When an alpha female and a lower-ranking female want to mate with an alpha male, the more dominant female will get rights to the male over the lower-ranking one.

== Intelligence ==
The capuchin is considered to be the most intelligent New World monkey and is often kept in captivity. The tufted monkey is especially noted for its long-term tool usage, one of the few examples of primate tool use other than by apes including humans. Upon seeing macaws eating palm nuts, cracking them open with their beaks, this monkey will select a few of the ripest fruits, nip off the tip of the fruit and drink down the juice, then seemingly discard the rest of the fruit with the nut inside. When these discarded fruits have hardened and become slightly brittle, the capuchin will gather them up again and take them to a large flat boulder where they have previously gathered a few river stones from up to a mile away. They will then use these stones, some of them weighing as much as the monkeys, to crack open the fruit to get to the nut inside. Young capuchins will watch this process to learn from the older, more experienced adults but it takes them 8 years to master this. The learning behavior of capuchins has been demonstrated to be directly linked to a reward rather than curiosity.

In 2005, experiments were conducted on the ability of capuchins to use money. After several months of training, the monkeys began exhibiting behaviors considered to reflect an understanding of the concept of a medium of exchange that were previously believed to be restricted to humans (such as responding rationally to price shocks). They showed the same propensity to avoid perceived losses demonstrated by human subjects and investors.

During the mosquito season, they crush millipedes and rub the result on their backs. This acts as a natural insect repellent.

=== Self-awareness ===
When presented with a reflection, capuchin monkeys react in a way that indicates an intermediate state between seeing the mirror as another individual and recognizing the image as self.

Most animals react to seeing their reflections as if encountering another individual they do not recognize. An experiment with capuchins shows that they react to a reflection as a strange phenomenon, but not as if seeing a strange capuchin.

In the experiment, capuchins were presented with three different scenarios:
# Seeing an unfamiliar, same-sex monkey on the other side of a clear barrier.
# Seeing a familiar, same-sex monkey on the other side of a clear barrier.
# A mirror showing a reflection of the monkey.

In scenario 1, females appeared anxious and avoided eye-contact, while males made threatening gestures. In scenario 2, there was little reaction by either males or females.

When presented with a reflection, females gazed into their own eyes and made friendly gestures, such as lip-smacking and swaying. Males made more eye contact than with strangers or familiar monkeys but reacted with signs of confusion or distress, such as squealing, curling up on the floor, or trying to escape from the test room.

=== Theory of mind ===
The question of whether capuchin monkeys have a theory of mind—whether they can understand what another creature may know or think—has been neither proven nor disproven conclusively. If confronted with a &quot;knower-guesser&quot; scenario, where one trainer can be observed to know the location of food and another trainer merely guesses the location of food, capuchin monkeys can learn to rely on the knower. This has, however, been repudiated as conclusive evidence for a theory of mind as the monkeys may have learned to discriminate knower and guess by other means. Until recently it was believed that non-human great apes did not possess a theory of mind either, although recent research indicates this may not be correct. Human children commonly develop a theory of mind around the ages 3 and 4.

== Threats ==

Capuchin monkeys are threatened by deforestation, the pet trade, and humans hunting for bushmeat. According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, nearly all species are decreasing in population, with many facing threats of extinction. Since capuchins have a high reproductive rate and can adapt to different living environments, they can survive forest loss more than some other species; however, habitat fragmentation is still a threat. Predators include jaguars, cougars, jaguarundis, coyotes, tayras, snakes, crocodiles, birds of prey, and humans. The main predator of the tufted capuchin is the harpy eagle, which has been seen bringing several capuchin back to its nest.

== Relationship with humans ==
Easily recognized as the &quot;organ grinder&quot; or &quot;greyhound jockey&quot; monkeys, capuchins are sometimes kept as exotic pets. Sometimes they plunder fields and crops and are seen as troublesome by nearby human populations. In some regions, they have become rare due to the destruction of their habitat.

Capuchins have been used as service animals, and were once referred to as &quot;nature&#x27;s butlers&quot; by the AARP. Helping Hands, a nonprofit organization, trained capuchin monkeys to assist quadriplegics as monkey helpers in a manner similar to mobility assistance dogs. 

In 2010, the U.S. federal government revised its definition of service animal under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Non-human primates are no longer recognized as service animals under the ADA. The American Veterinary Medical Association does not support the use of nonhuman primates as assistance animals because of animal welfare concerns, the potential for serious injury to people, and risks that primates may transfer dangerous diseases to humans. In 2021, Helping Hands (the organization that provided helper monkeys to disabled persons) rebranded, changing its name to Envisioning Access and replaced the use of monkeys with a focus on new assistive technologies.

Capuchin monkeys are the most common featured monkeys in film and television, with notable examples including: &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; (and its sequels), &quot;Outbreak&quot;, &quot;Monkey Shines&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (and its sequels), &quot;Zookeeper&quot;, &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;, and &quot;The Hangover Part II&quot;. Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) on the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; had a capuchin monkey named Marcel. Crystal the Monkey is a famous monkey actress.

<text>Jakob Ulvsson (1430s – spring 1521) was the archbishop of Uppsala and primate of the Roman Catholic Church of Sweden from 1469 to 1515. He was also the founder of Uppsala University in 1477.

==Biography==
Jakob Ulvsson came from a noble family background. He was born at Hacksta gård at Trögds härad in Uppland.
He studied at the universities in Rostock (Bachelor of Arts in 1458/1459) and Paris (magister 1460). 

He spent the years 1465–1470 in Rome and was meanwhile appointed Canon of Uppsala in 1465 and Archdeacon of Växjö in 1468. Despite King Karl Knutsson wanting to make one of his own relatives Archbishop of Uppsala, Jakob Ulvsson was appointed archbishop by the pope in 1469 and ordained in Rome in 1470, after which he returned to Uppsala. 

In the conflicts between the Danish king Christian I of Denmark and the Swedish regent Sten Sture, Jakob took a mediating position, trying as far as possible to avoid open warfare, especially in Uppland. After Sten Sture&#x27;s victory in the Battle at Brunkeberg in 1471, the situation stabilized and he participated in the work of the privy council. 

He is usually regarded is the main initiator of the university in Uppsala, which was founded after having received papal approval in the form of a bull of Pope Sixtus IV dated 27 February 1477. Jakob Ulvsson was appointed first chancellor of the university. He resigned from the archbishopric in 1515. He was Archbishop Emeritus of Uppsala until his death at Mariefred Charterhouse in 1521.

<doc id="1238659" wikidata="Q780692" url="?curid=1238659" title="Ernie Terrell">
<text>Ernest Terrell (April 4, 1939 – December 16, 2014) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1957 to 1973. He held the World Boxing Association&#x27;s heavyweight title from 1965 to 1967, and was one of the tallest heavyweights of his era, at tall. He unsuccessfully fought the other world heavyweight champion of the era, Muhammad Ali, in a heavyweight title unification contest in 1967, losing by a unanimous decision. Terrell was the elder brother of the Supremes&#x27; early 1970s lead singer Jean Terrell. In the 1960s, Jean sang with Ernie&#x27;s group Ernie Terrell &amp; the Heavyweights.

==Early life==
Terrell was born on 4 April 1939 in Inverness, Mississippi, and spent his early childhood in Belzoni. He was born into a family of ten children, whose father was a Mississippi sharecropper who during Terrell&#x27;s childhood moved the family north to Chicago when he found employment in the factories there. Terrell received his formal education at Farragut School in Chicago. Before turning professional, he won the Chicago Golden Gloves in his youth as a light heavyweight, and he also formed a pop music singing act called &quot;The Heavyweights&quot; with three of his siblings.

==Professional career==
In his early career, Terrell defeated some good contenders, including Cleveland Williams (Terrell won a rematch with Williams by decision after losing their first fight by knockout), Zora Folley, and future light heavyweight champion Bob Foster.

When the World Boxing Association stripped Muhammad Ali of his title after his agreement to fight a rematch with Sonny Liston, the WBA matched Terrell and Eddie Machen for the vacant crown. Terrell defeated Machen to win the belt on March 5, 1965. During his reign as WBA champion, he defended the title twice, beating Doug Jones and George Chuvalo. Most in the boxing world continued to recognize Ali as the legitimate champion, for he had not lost his championship in a boxing match. The WBA&#x27;s rival, the World Boxing Council, also continued to recognize Ali as champion. On March 29, 1966, Ali and Terrell were scheduled to fight, but Terrell backed out (Ali won a 15-round decision against substitute opponent George Chuvalo).

On February 6, 1967, Ali and Terrell finally met to end the debate about who was the legitimate heavyweight champion. Before the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali by his birth name. He said later that he had known &quot;Clay&quot; for years in the amateurs and hadn&#x27;t gotten used to calling him another name. Publicly, Ali took offense to this, and vowed he would punish Terrell. In a 1979 interview, he said, &quot;They billed the fight on that little grudge thing, and I wasn&#x27;t really angry - I didn&#x27;t care what he called me - but this was a good chance to promote my new image.&quot;

Ali further stoked the prefight ill-will by labeling Terrell &quot;an Uncle Tom nigger who is going to get his ass whupped&quot;. Ali won by unanimous decision, reclaiming the undisputed championship. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that the resulting fight was &quot;the nastiest display of Ali&#x27;s celebrated ring career&quot;, describing how he seized Terrell in a headlock and dragged Terrell&#x27;s eye along the top rope, and declared, &quot;The fight will be remembered for Ali&#x27;s constant taunts of &#x27;what&#x27;s my name?&#x27; to an opponent he was apparently content not merely to defeat, but also to belittle and humiliate.&quot; The match is recounted in the film &quot;Ali&quot;.

Terrell lost an upset 12-round decision to Thad Spencer later in 1967 in the WBA heavyweight tournament that was organized after Ali was stripped of his title in April 1967. He left the sport for three years following the loss, but returned in 1970, winning seven consecutive fights before losing to Chuck Wepner by decision. The Wepner decision was highly controversial; most who saw the fight thought Terrell had won. After losing to Jeff Merritt in his next fight by a 1st-round technical knockout, Terrell retired.

In 55 professional fights, Terrell earned a record of 46 wins (21 by knockout), nine losses and no draws.

==Later life==
After retiring from boxing he began a career as a record producer in Chicago. 

He ran unsuccessfully for alderman of Chicago&#x27;s 34th ward in 1987, finishing second in the primary although lost to Lemuel Austin in a runoff.

==Death==
Terrell died at the age of 75 on December 16, 2014, in a hospital at Evergreen Park, Illinois, having been afflicted in his final years with dementia. 

He was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, Chicago.

==Personal life==
Terrell married Maxine Sibley in 1974; the couple raised two children.

<text>The Cimitero Monumentale ( &quot;Monumental Cemetery&quot;) is one of the two largest cemeteries in Milan, Italy, the other one being the Cimitero Maggiore. It is noted for the abundance of artistic tombs and monuments.

Designed by the architect Carlo Maciachini (1818–1899), it was planned to consolidate a number of small cemeteries that used to be scattered around the city into a single location.

Officially opened in 1866, it has since then been filled with a wide range of contemporary and classical Italian sculptures as well as Greek temples, elaborate obelisks, and other original works such as a scaled-down version of the Trajan&#x27;s Column. Many of the tombs belong to noted industrialist dynasties, and were designed by artists such as Adolfo Wildt, Giò Ponti, Arturo Martini, Agenore Fabbri, Lucio Fontana, Medardo Rosso, Giacomo Manzù, Floriano Bodini, and Giò Pomodoro.

The main entrance is through the large Famedio, a massive &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;-like Neo-Medieval style building made of marble and stone that contains the tombs of some of the city&#x27;s and the country&#x27;s most honored citizens, including that of novelist Alessandro Manzoni.

The Civico Mausoleo Palanti designed by the architect Mario Palanti is a tomb built for meritorious &quot;Milanesi&quot;, or citizens of Milan. The memorial of about 800 Milanese killed in Nazi concentration camps is located in the center and is the work of the group BBPR, formed by leading exponents of Italian rationalist architecture that included Gianluigi Banfi.

The cemetery has a special section for those who do not belong to the Catholic religion and a Jewish section.

Near the entrance there is a permanent exhibition of prints, photographs, and maps outlining the cemetery&#x27;s historical development. It includes two battery-operated electric hearses built in the 1920s.

== The Jewish Section ==
The section, designed by Carlo Maciachini, opened in 1872 to replace the cemeteries of Porta Tenaglia, Porta Magenta, and Porta Vercellina. It lies east of the Catholic cemetery and has a separate entrance. The area is the result of a 1913 expansion to the southern and east. The central building was originally the entrance to the cemetery.

Tomb numbering is repeated because the cemetery is divided into six fields and an addition in the eastern side. There are also three common fields, including one for children, where burials date from 1873 to 1894, with small gravestones on the ground bearing the names and dates of death.

The monuments, built from 1866 onward, are located along the walkways. There are also family shrines, two of which were designed by Maciachini, columbaria, and ossuaries along the northern and western cemetery walls and burials in the central building. There are 1778 burials, some in memory of people killed by in Nazi concentration camps or in the Lake Maggiore massacres, including at Meina.

There are many monuments of artistic value built by important architects and sculptors, described in the guide book by Giovanna Ginex and Ornella Selvafolta .
The following architects have worked in the Jewish section: Carlo Maciachini (Davide Leonino and Pisa shrines), Giovanni Battista Bossi (Anselmo de Benedetti tomb), Ercole Balossi Merlo (Leon David Levi shrine), Luigi Conconi (Segre shrine), Giovanni Ceruti (Vitali shrine), Carlo Meroni (Taranto tomb), Cesare Mazzocchi (Giulio Foligno shrine), Manfredo d&#x27;Urbino (Jarach shrine, Mayer tomb, Besso tomb, Monument to the Jewish Martyrs of Nazism), Gigiotti Zanini (Zanini tomb), Adolfo Valabrega (Moisé Foligno shrine), Luigi Perrone (Goldfinger shrine). Sculptors whose work is found here include: Mario Quadrelli (Pisa shrine), Giuseppe Daniele Benzoni (Ottolenghi Finzi tomb), Luigi Vimercati (Estella Jung tomb), Agostino Caravati (Alessandro Forti tomb), Rizzardo Galli (Vittorio Finzi tomb), Enrico Cassi (De Daninos tomb), Attilio Prendoni (Errera and Conforti tomb), Eduardo Ximenes (Treves shrine), Giulio Branca (Giovanni Norsa tomb, Michelangelo Carpi tomb), fratelli Bonfanti (Davide and Beniamino Foà tomb), Enrico Astorri (Carolina Padova and Fanny Levi Cammeo tomb), Egidio Boninsegna (Giuseppe Levi tomb), Dario Viterbo (Levi Minzi columbarium), Giannino Castiglioni (Ettore Levis and Goldfinger tombs), Adolfo Wildt (Cesare Sarfatti tomb), Eugenio Pellini (Bettino Levi tomb), Arrigo Minerbi (Renato del Mar tomb), Roberto Terracini (Nino Colombo tomb).

The central building was enhanced in May 2015 with artistic windows that represent the Twelve Tribes of Israel by the artist Diego Pennacchio Ardemagni.

==Crematorium==

The cemetery contains the Crematorium Temple, which was the first crematorium to open in the Western world. The crematorium opened in 1876 and was operational until 1992. The building is also a columbarium. As with other early crematoria in Italy, it was built in Greek Revival architecture.

<doc id="1238697" wikidata="Q3693413" url="?curid=1238697" title="Cordless">
<text>The term cordless is generally used to refer to electrical or electronic devices that are powered by a battery or battery pack and can operate without a power cord or cable attached to an electrical outlet to provide mains power, allowing greater mobility.
The term &quot;cordless&quot; should not be confused with the term &quot;wireless&quot;, although it often is in common usage, possibly because some cordless devices (e.g., cordless telephones) are also wireless. The term &quot;wireless&quot; generally refers to devices that use some form of energy (e.g., radio waves, infrared, ultrasonic, etc.) to transfer &quot;information&quot; or &quot;commands&quot; over a distance without the use of communication wires, regardless of whether the device gets its power from a power cord or a battery. The term &quot;&quot; is an even more general term and, when referring to electrical and electronic devices, usually means devices which are totally self-contained (e.g., have built-in power supplies, have no base unit, etc.) and which may also use wireless technology.

<doc id="1238700" wikidata="Q1073208" url="?curid=1238700" title="Tom Molineaux">
<text>Thomas Molineaux (March 23, 1784 – August 4, 1818), sometimes spelled Molyneaux or Molyneux, was an American bare-knuckle boxer and possibly a former slave. He spent much of his career in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, where he had notable successes. He arrived in England in 1809 and started his fighting career there in 1810. His two fights against Tom Cribb in 1810 and 1811 widely viewed as the Champion of England, brought Molineaux fame even though he lost both contests. The result of the first encounter was hotly contested, with accusations of a fix. The second match with Cribb, however, was an undisputed loss. His prizefighting career ended in 1815. After a tour that took him to Scotland and Ireland, he died in Galway, Ireland, in 1818 at age 34.

==Early life==
According to some of the chroniclers of 19th-century boxing, Molineaux was born into slavery in the State of Virginia, USA in 1784. The most detailed account claims that he was born on a plantation and that he took his surname from the owners&#x27; name. An earlier writer just states that he came from the United States of America. In one account he boxed with other slaves to entertain plantation owners and was granted his freedom and $500 after winning a fight on which the son of the plantation owner had staked $100,000. Another source claims he was in the service of the one-time American ambassador to London, William Pinkney. One of his biographers points out that while some of these accounts may be based on truth, they cannot be substantiated and may have been romanticised to some extent. After obtaining his freedom, Molineaux was reported to have moved to New York, where he was said to have been involved in &quot;several battles&quot; and had claimed the title &quot;Champion of America&quot;. He subsequently emigrated to England where he expected to be able to earn money as a prize fighter.

==Career in Europe==
Molineaux found his way to London in 1809 where he made contact with Bill Richmond, another ex-slave-turned-boxer who ran the pub the &quot;Horse and Dolphin&quot; in Leicester Square, London.
Molineaux&#x27;s first fight in England occurred at Tothill Fields, Westminster, on July 24, 1810. According to one report, the match was preceded by bull baiting. Molineaux won the fight, beating Jack Burrows of Bristol in front of a small crowd in 65 minutes. Bill Richmond seconded Molineaux for the fight and Tom Cribb seconded Burrows.

Molineaux&#x27;s second fight in England was against Tom Blake, whose nickname was &quot;Tom Tough&quot;. The fight took place at Epple Bay near Margate on August 21, 1810, the American ending up victorious after eight rounds when Molineaux knocked out Blake. In this fight, the American was reported to have shown &quot;great improvement in the science of pugilism&quot;.
On December 3, 1810, having been trained by Bill Richmond, Molineaux fought Tom Cribb at Shenington Hollow in Oxfordshire for the English title. According to the journalist and sportswriter Pierce Egan, who was present, Molineaux stood at five foot eight and a quarter inches tall and, for this fight, weighed &quot;fourteen stone two&quot; (). Egan wrote that few people, including Cribb, expected the fight to last very long; there was betting that Cribb would win in the first ten rounds. Molineaux proved a powerful and intelligent fighter, and the two heavily battered each other. There was a disturbance in the 19th round as Molineaux and Cribb were locked in a wrestler&#x27;s hold (legal under the rules of the time) so that neither could hit the other nor escape. The referee stood by, uncertain whether he should break the two apart, and the dissatisfied crowd pushed into the ring. In the confusion, Molineaux hurt his left hand; Egan could not tell if it had been broken. There was a dispute over whether Cribb had returned to the line before the allowed 30 seconds had passed. If he had not, Molineaux would have won, but the referee could not tell in the confusion and the fight went on. After the 34th round, Molineaux said he could not continue, but his second persuaded him to return to the ring, where he was defeated in the 35th round.

Two days after the fight, Richmond took Molineaux to the Stock Exchange in London, where the boxer received an ovation and was presented with 45 guineas.

On May 21, 1811, Molineaux took on William Rimmer, a 22-year-old fighter from Lancashire. The bout took place at Moulsey Hurst and Molineaux won after 21 rounds.

A return fight with Tom Cribb took place on September 28, 1811, at Thistleton Gap in Rutland and was watched by 15,000 people. Egan, who was present, said that both fighters &quot;weighed less by more than a stone&quot;, which means Molineaux weighed at most for this fight. As preparation for the bout, Cribb had undertaken extensive training under the guidance of Captain Barclay. Molineaux, though still hitting Cribb with great power, was out-fought; Cribb broke his jaw and finally knocked him out in the 11th round. After the fight Richmond and Molineaux parted.

Molineaux fought four subsequent bouts, winning three and losing one. On April 2 1813, Molineaux fought Jack Carter at Remington, Gloucestershire, the American winning after 25 rounds. After the fight, Molineaux went on tour, where he sparred in exhibition bouts. In 1813, he fought Abraham Denton at Derby, his opponent being described as a &quot;country pugilist&quot; with the stature of a giant. Molineaux won the contest. The tour took him to Scotland, and on May 27, 1814, he took on a boxer named William Fuller at Bishopstorff, Paisley, Ayrshire. After four rounds of fighting the match was interrupted when the &quot;sheriff of Renfrewshire, attended by constables, entered the ring, and put a stop to it&quot;. A rematch was staged at Auchineux, 12 miles from Glasgow on May 31, 1814. 2 rounds were fought there, lasting 68 minutes, Molineaux being awarded the contest. On March 11, 1815, Molineaux fought and lost to George Cooper at Corset Hill, Lanarkshire.

Molineaux also entered Cornish wrestling tournaments in England when touring in the early 1800s.

==Post-boxing life==
Molineaux&#x27;s prizefighting career ended in 1815. However, he continued to show his talents in sparring exhibitions. After visiting Scotland, he toured Ireland, where in 1817, he was reportedly in the northern part of the island. He suffered from tuberculosis. After a stint in a debtors&#x27; prison he became increasingly dependent on alcohol.

He died penniless in the bandroom of the 77th Regiment in Galway, Ireland, on 4 August 1818. He was 34 years old.

In 2018, Galway City Museum held an exhibition on the life of Molineaux to mark the 200th anniversary of his death. Also in 2018 a plaque was erected in Galway at the site of his death.

In 2019, Katie Taylor unveiled a headstone over his previously unmarked grave in St James&#x27; graveyard in Galway.

<doc id="1238710" wikidata="Q2652759" url="?curid=1238710" title="Akash (missile)">
<text>Akash () is a medium-range mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) system developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). The Army and the Air Force variants of the missile system are produced by Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) and Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL). Surveillance and fire control radar, Tactical Command and Control Center and missile launcher are developed by BEL, Tata Advanced Systems Limited and Larsen &amp; Toubro. The Akash missile system can target aircraft up to away. It has the capability to neutralise aerial targets like fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles. It is in operational service with the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force.

An Akash battery comprises a single PESA 3D Rajendra radar and four launchers with three missiles each, all of which are interlinked. Each battery can track up to 64 targets and attack up to 12 of them. The missile has a high-explosive, pre-fragmented warhead with a proximity fuse. The Akash system is fully mobile and capable of protecting a moving convoy of vehicles. The launch platform has been integrated with both wheeled and tracked vehicles. While the Akash system has primarily been designed as an air defence SAM, it also has been tested in a missile defense role. The system provides air defence missile coverage for an area of . The Indian military&#x27;s combined orders of the Akash, including radar systems (WLR and Surveillance), have a total worth of . As per Ministry of Defence (MoD) Report 2018, existing order of Akash saved of foreign exchange for India on imports.

==Description==
===System===
Each Akash battery consists of four self-propelled Launchers (three Akash SAMs each), a Battery Level Radar – the Rajendra, and a Command post (Battery Control Centre). Two batteries are deployed as a Squadron (Air Force), while up to four form an Akash Group/Regiment (Army configuration). In both configurations, an extra Group Control Centre (GCC) is added, which acts as the Command and Control HQ of the Squadron or Group. Based on a single mobile platform, GCC establishes links with Battery Control Centres and conducts air defense operations in coordination with air defense set up in a zone of operations. For early warning, the GCC relies on the Central Acquisition Radar. However, individual batteries can also be deployed with the cheaper, 2-D BSR (Battery Surveillance Radar) with a range of over 100 km.

Akash has an advanced automated functioning capability. The 3D CAR automatically starts tracking targets at a distance of around 150 km providing early warning to the system and operators. The target track information is transferred to GCC. GCC automatically classifies the target. BSR starts tracking targets around a range of 100 km. This data is transferred to GCC. The GCC performs multi-radar tracking of up to 200 targets and carries out track correlation &amp; data fusion. Target position information is sent to the BLR which uses this information to acquire the targets.

The BCC which can engage a target(s) from the selected list at the earliest point of time is assigned the target in real time by the GCC. The availability of missiles and the health of the missiles are also taken into consideration during this process. Fresh targets are assigned as and when intercepts with assigned targets are completed. A single shot kill probability of 88% has been achieved by the system taking into consideration various parametres of the sensors, guidance command, missile capabilities and kill zone computations.

There are a number of possibilities for deploying Akash weapon system in autonomous mode and in group mode for neutralizing the threat profiles with defined multi-target engagement scenarios. In the Group mode we can have number of configurations to defend vulnerable areas depending upon nature and expected threat pattern, characteristics of threat. Similarly, multiple batteries in autonomous mode can be deployed to defend vulnerable areas/points. In a Group formation, the four Batteries can be deployed in various geometric formations, as suited to the vulnerable area being protected and the extent desired to be sanitized from enemy air threat. In a box deployment pattern, an Akash group can defend an area of 62 km x 62 km. In a linear array configuration, it covers an area of 98 km x 44 km. Trapezoidal configuration gives defense to the largest area as compared to any other pattern of deployment covering an area of size 5,000 square km.

Each Akash battery can engage up to four targets simultaneously with 24 ready to fire missiles. Each battery has four launchers with three missiles, while each Rajendra able to guide eight missiles in total, with a maximum of two missiles per target. Up to a maximum of four targets can be engaged simultaneously by a typical battery with a single Rajendra if one (or two) missile is allotted per target. A single Akash missile has an 88% probability of kill. Two missiles can be fired, five seconds apart, to raise the probability of Kill to 98.5%. Communications between the various vehicles are a combination of wireless and wired links. The entire system is designed to be set up quickly and to be highly mobile for high survivability. The Akash system can be deployed by rail, road or air.

===Missile===

Akash is a surface-to-air missile with an intercept range of 25 km. It has a launch weight of 720 kg, a diameter of 35 cm and a length of 5.78 meters. Akash flies at supersonic speed, reaching around Mach 2.5. It can reach an altitude of 20 km and can be fired from both tracked and wheeled platforms. An on-board guidance system coupled with an actuator system makes the missile maneuverable up to 15g loads and a tail chase capability for end game engagement. A digital proximity fuse is coupled with a 55 kg pre-fragmented warhead, while the safety arming and detonation mechanism enables a controlled detonation sequence. A self-destruct device is also integrated. It is propelled by an Integrated Ramjet Rocket Engine. The use of a ramjet propulsion system enables sustained speeds without deceleration throughout its flight. The Missile has command guidance in its entire flight.

The design of the missile is somewhat similar to that of the 2K12 Kub with four long tube ramjet inlet ducts mounted mid-body between wings. For pitch/yaw control four clipped triangular moving wings are mounted on the mid-body. For roll control four inline clipped delta fins with ailerons are mounted before the tail. However, the internal schematic shows a different layout with an onboard digital computer, absence of semi-active seeker, different propellant, different actuators and command guidance with datalinks. The Akash carries an onboard radio-proximity fuse.

Composite technology for Akash includes radome assemblies, booster liners, ablative liners, sustainer liners, compression molded wings and fins. The aerodynamic characterization research was conducted at the National Aerospace Laboratories&#x27; 1.2m Trisonic Wind Tunnel Facility.

===Propulsion===
The Akash, like the Russian 2K12 Kub (SA-6 Gainful), utilizes an integrated ramjet-rocket propulsion system, which, after initial rocket motor burnout, provides sustained thrust for the missile throughout its flight until interception.

===Radars===


The missile is guided by a phased array fire control radar called &#x27;Rajendra&#x27; which is termed as Battery Level Radar (BLR) with a tracking range of about 60 km. The tracking and missile guidance radar configuration consists of a slewable phased array antenna of more than 4,000 elements, spectrally pure TWT transmitter, two stage superheterodyne correlation receiver for three channels, high speed digital signal processor, real time management computer and a powerful radar data processor. It can track 64 targets in range, azimuth and height and guide eight missiles simultaneously in ripple fire mode towards four targets. The radar has advanced ECCM features. The Rajendra derivative on a BMP-2 chassis and to be used by the Indian Air Force is known as the Battery Level Radar-II whereas that for the Army, is based on a T-72 chassis and is known as the Battery Level Radar-III.

The Army version also consists of the Battery Surveillance Radar (BSR). BSR is a track vehicle based, long range sensor, interfaced with the BCC. It can detect and track up to 40 targets in range and azimuth up to a range of 100 km.

Long range target acquisition is performed by the 3D Central Acquisition Radar (3D CAR), which is a long range surveillance radar that can track up to 200 targets in Track while Scan mode (detecting, tracking and processing) in three dimensions at a range of 180 km. It provides azimuth, range and height coordinates of targets to the Group Control Centre (GCC) through secure communication links. The data is used to cue the weapon control radar.

===Platforms===

The Army&#x27;s radar and launchers are based on the T-72 chassis built by the Ordnance Factories Board&#x27;s Ordnance Factory Medak to accompany the Army&#x27;s fast moving armoured formations. The Air Force versions use a combination of tracked and wheeled vehicle. The Air Force Akash launcher consists of a detachable trailer which is towed by a Tata truck, which can be positioned autonomously. The Air Force launcher is designed by Larsen &amp; Toubro jointly with DRDO. Both the Army and Air Force launchers have three ready-to-fire Akash missiles each. The launchers can slew in both elevation and azimuth. The Army Self-Propelled Launcher (ASPL) is 360 degrees slewable and its arc in elevation is from 6 to 60 degrees. The Akash Air Force Launcher (AAFL) is 360 degree slewable, in elevation it can fire from 8 to 55 degrees in all directions depending on the mode of deployment. Akash Air force launcher features an All electro servo drive system for fully automated and remote operation.
To enable the Akash group to perform self-sufficient in the combat zone, a number of supporting specialist vehicles have been designed and developed. They are mobile and field-worthy. Their design is based on the role and task to be performed and the vehicles are accordingly allocated to the Group HQ, the Batteries, Assembly Line Area and the Field maintenance workshop. Some of the vehicles are: the Missile Transportation Vehicle (MTV), the Transportation and Loading Vehicle (TLV), the Mobile Station for Missile Checkout (MSMC) Vehicle, the Air Compressor Vehicle (ACV), the Power Supply vehicles (GPSV, BPSV), the Engineering Support, Maintenance and Repair vehicles (GEM, BEM) and a few others. These specialist vehicles assemble and prepare missiles, deliver them to Batteries, carry maintenance spares and fuel, and provide logistical engineering support. Their allocation provides for flexibility and self-sufficiency to the whole Akash Group.

==Development and history==
===Mark-I===
The first test flight of Akash missile was conducted in 1990, with development flights up to March 1997.

Two Akash missiles intercepted two fast moving targets in simultaneous engagement mode in 2005. 3-D Central Acquisition Radar (3D-CAR) group mode performance is also fully established.

The Akash Missile Development cost of ₹1,000 crore (€150 million; $200 million), including the project sanction of ₹600 crore (€90 million; $120 million), is 8-10 times lower than the cost of similar system developments in other countries. Akash has certain unique characteristics like mobility, all-the-way-powered flight till target interception, multiple target handling, digitally-coded command guidance and fully automatic operation.

For the first time, Akash showed in Exercise Astrashakti 2023 that it could engage four targets at once under command guidance with a single fire unit at a maximum range of about 30 km. The targets were divided to attack defense assets from various angles and were approaching from the same direction in a close formation.

==== Akash-1S ====
There was demand from Indian Armed Forces for a missile with a seeker that can target inbound targets more accurately for which the DRDO offered an upgraded Akash with an indigenous seeker named Akash-1S. DRDO tested Akash-1S on 25 May and 27 May 2019 with a strike range of 30 km that has the capability to carry warhead of 60 kg from Integrated Test Range (ITR), Chandipur, Odisha with the overall performance of indigenous seeker and guidance system consistently established during the period. Akash-1S was fired five times against multiple targets and successfully completed the trials. It supports the combination of both command and active terminal seeker guidance to enhance the single shot kill probability and is capable of striking down fighter jets and drones at a distance of around 18 to 30 km that can be fired from both tracked and wheeled platforms for greater mobility.

=====Akash Prime=====

On 27 September 2021, DRDO test fired a new version of missile called Akash Prime. It intercepted and destroyed an unmanned aerial target mimicking enemy aircraft, in its maiden flight. Akash Prime is based on the existing Akash SAM. The missile is equipped with an improved active Ku, X band monopulse radio-frequency (RF) seeker developed by Research Center Imarat to further increase the accuracy. Akash Prime is also optimized for low temperature and high altitude operations with modified ground system. The improved RF seeker has 360° engagement capability. Akash Prime consists of a long-range surveillance radar, a target and missile tracking radar, a troop control centre, and the launchers.

=== Akash-NG ===
A successor missile with a new design Akash – New generation abbreviated as Akash-NG was approved in September 2016 with a funding of to succeed Akash and Akash-1S with improved capabilities. Akash-NG will have an improved reaction time and higher level of protection against saturation attacks. The second stage uses dual-pulse solid rocket motor which is lighter instead of air-breathing solid ramjet engine to increase the overall range from current 25–30 km to 70–80 km, an active electronically scanned array Multi-Function Radar (MFR) and optical proximity fuze.

== Trials ==

* Between 14 and 21 December 2007, the Indian Air Force completed user trials for this missile. The trials were declared successful after the missile hit the target on five occasions. Multiple target handling capability of Akash weapon system was demonstrated by live firing in C4I environment. The last trial was conducted at 2:15 pm IST on 21 December. Before the ten-day trial at Integrated Test Range, Chandipur, Odisha, ECCM Evaluation tests were carried out at Gwalior Air Force Station and mobility trials were carried out in Pokhran. The IAF had evolved the user Trial Directive to verify the Akash&#x27;s consistency. The trials included firing missiles against multiple targets which included low-flying near-range target, long-range high-altitude target, crossing and approaching target and ripple firing of two missiles from the same launcher against a low-altitude receding target.
* From 24 May to 6 June 2012, the Air Force version of the Akash missile, with a strike range of 25 km and 60 kg warhead, was tested five times from the Launch Complex-III (LC-3) of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur off the Odisha coast. These were user specific trials and a part of the routine air defence exercises of India. On 24 May 2012, India successfully test fired Akash missile to revalidate technology and operational efficacy. The target was a floating object towed by a Pilotless Target Aircraft. On 26 and 28 May, the missile were test fired again in a similar way. Two of the missile tests in May failed as the missile did not take-off as they were scheduled for successive launches. On 1 June, two Air Force variant missiles were fired back-to-back from the ITR. On 6 June at 07:57 am IST, two of the Air Force version of the missile from the LC-III of the ITR. This was the fifth trial of the missile system variant since 24 May 2012.
* On 21 and 24 February 2014, the Indian Army successfully tested the Akash missiles from the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur. The tests were a part of pre-induction trials by the Army. On 21 February, the missile hit an aproaching target towed by PTA Lakshya. On 24 February, the missile hit an receding target at a distance of 19 km. The missiles were part of the first of Production Model system being producedto equip the 2 regiments on order for the Army.
* From 23 April to 2 May 2014, the Indian Air Force tested the Akash system from LC-3 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur on four days. On 23 April, the Akash missiles failed to intercept the target from the Pilotless Target Aircraft. The PTA was launched from Launch Complex-II (LC-2) of the ITR at around 2:30 pm IST. The missile is designed to pass through the &quot;missed-distance proximity&quot; (MDP) causing &quot;auto-detonation&quot; of the proximity fuse. However, the missile missed the MDP. On 26 April, Indian Air Force successfully tested 2 Akash missiles taken from the production lot against an incoming and a receding target both towed by PTA Lakshya. All the assets including missiles, launchers, radar, command centres and the drone was being controlled by Air Force personnel. The test was conducted from the ITR Complex. On 29 April, Two more trials were expected to be conducted. However, the PTA failed to take off resulting in the postponement of the tests. On 1 May, PTA Lakshya was launched from LC-2 of the ITR. The missile which was expected to intercept the target after 15 minutes, failed to take off from LC-3. The problem was speculated as perennial technical problem of the missile. This was the missile’s second failure in the recent seven-test series by the IAF. On 2 May, the same tests were carried out where the missile hit para-barrel targets successfully. The test was conducted from LC-3 at 2:28 pm IST.
* On 3 August 2014, Akash missile test-fired from LC-3 of the ITR at Chandipur off the Odisha coast. The test was described as &quot;fully successful&quot; by the Director of ITR.
* In November 2014, training user trials of the Akash surface-to-air supersonic missiles were completed successfully on Friday. The trials were conducted for 5 consecutive days. All mission parameters, as set by the Indian Air Force (IAF) team, were validated.
* On 11 to 13 April 2015, Indian Army successfully conducted six rounds of user trials of the missile. The tests were conducted from complex 3 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur in Odisha. The missiles targeted pilot less target aircraft (PTA) Lakshya, unmanned air vehicle (UAV) &#x27;Banshee&#x27; and a para barrel target, two times each.
* On 28 January 2016, the missile was successfully test fired from Launch Complex-3 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur in Odisha. As part of a user trial from the ITR, three rounds of test were carried out by the Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel aiming at para-barrel target between 11 pm and 2 pm IST. Tests were aimed at gauging the flight consistency and effectiveness of the missile, besides ascertaining the serviceability of the system in various conditions.
* On 8 March 2016, Indian Air Force (IAF) demonstrated the missile at the exercise Iron Fist 2016.
* On 28 and 29 November 2017, the Indian Air Force carried out 3 tests of the missile from Launch Complex 3 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) against electronic targets.
* On 30 November 2017, Indian Army successfully tested fired five Akash missiles at Integrated Test Range (ITR) against multiple targets.
* On 5 December 2017, another test with an indigenous radio frequency seeker was successfully carried out by the Army against a Banshee aerial drone.
* On 3 December 2020, the Indian Air Force carried out 10 missile firing at Suryalanka to bolster its capability among ongoing Indo-Sino border tension. The missiles were fired to validate different scenario and majority of the missiles scored a direct kill further establishing the efficacy of Akash missile.
* On 17 December 2023, during an exercise Astraskati the Indian Air Force fired 4 missile simultaneously from 2 Akash launcher of a single firing unit neutralizing 4 UAV&#x27;s simultaneously using command guidance. All target were detected and shot down at the maximum range of 30 km. This marks the Akash system as the first system in the world to successfully track and destroy 4 target using a single firing unit in command guidance. These tests were conducted from the new units ordered by Indian Air Force.
* On 31 March 2024, another test of Akash missiles were carried out successfully by Army&#x27;s Western Command&#x27;s 128 AD Missile Regiment.

==Status==
Each missile is expected to have starting costs below US$500,000 i.e. under ₹2 crore which is less than half the cost of similar Western missiles which usually cost between US$1.2-1.5 million (₹5-6 crore) each. It is expected that this cost will further decrease because of the economies of scale achieved as production ramps up. The Indian military (IAF &amp; IA) have a combined order worth ₹23,300 crore ($5.18 billion). As of 3 August 2014, the Air Force version has already been inducted while the Army version is in the final stage of its trial. The Army version was inducted on 5 May 2015, as was tweeted by MoD Spokesman. On 16 March 2016, Director of Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), said that India is looking to double missile production to 100 per month, up from 50 to 60.

A Comptroller and Auditor General report released in 2017 stated that because of a lack of adequate storage facilities, the life span of the missiles may be affected. In addition, there was a 30% failure rate during testing of missiles in inventory with 6 out of 20 missiles failing to hit their targets.

===Indian Air Force===
The Indian Air Force was satisfied with the performance of Akash after extensive flight trials and has decided to induct the weapon system. An order for two squadrons were placed initially, with these being inducted in 2009. The IAF found the missile performance to be satisfactory and was expected to place orders for 16 more launchers to form two more squadrons for India&#x27;s northeast theater.

In May 2008, the Indian Air Force decided to induct two squadrons (totaling 4 batteries) of Akash missile.

In March 2009, Tata Power&#x27;s Strategic Engineering Division (Tata Power SED) announced that it had secured the order for 16 Akash launchers to be delivered in the next 33 months.

In January 2010, it was revealed that the Indian Air Force had ordered for 6 more squadrons. Each squadron will consist of 125 missiles, bringing the order to 750 missiles for 6 squadrons. The first two squadrons will consist of 48 missiles each while future squadrons will vary in number depending on the IAF. The additional missiles were ordered from state-run defence behemoth Bharat Electronics, who will act as the system integrator, at a cost of .

In February 2010, the Indian Air Force accepted the Akash missile system as a substantial part of its arsenal.

IAF orders may also rise as it phases out its Pechoras and if the Indo-Israeli JV to develop a MRSAM (Medium Range SAM) for the IAF continues to be put on hold, while a similar program for the Indian Navy proceeds unimpeded.

<text>Goring Lock is a lock and weir situated on the River Thames in England at the Goring Gap in the Chiltern Hills. The lock is located on the Oxfordshire bank at Goring-On-Thames, with Streatley, Berkshire on the opposite side of the river. It is just upstream of Goring and Streatley Bridge. The lock was first built in 1787 by the Thames Navigation Commissioners

The weir runs back to an island under the bridge and then another weir goes from there to the Streatley bank.

==History==

There was originally a weir and ferry here belonging to Goring Priory, which became the property of millers who kept a flash lock. A report in a newspaper of 1674 tells how 60 people drowned in the lock when the ferryman rowed too close to it. The pound lock was built in August 1787 from oak. Over several decades operation of the lock appears to have been shared with that of Cleeve Lock until 1869. Following this there were plans to build a lock-house, but this was not started until 1879. The lock itself was replaced in 1886. In the last rebuild in 1921 the lock had intermediate gates installed, making two pounds, but these were removed in the refit in 2003.

==Access to the lock==

The lock is situated almost under the bridge and is easily accessible from both Goring and Streatley

==Reach above the lock==
The reach is only just over half a mile long. The Cleeve side of the river is occupied by large gardens stretching down the hillside with several boat-houses on the river. There are islands below Cleeve lock, with weirs between them, and these extend for some distance. On the Streatley side are meadows and woods.

The Thames Path, having crossed Goring Bridge to Streatley, continues through on the western bank to Cleeve Lock.

<text>Buyeo Yung (615–682) was the eldest son of King Uija, the last king of Baekje. He was appointed crown prince in 644, and would have been the kingdom&#x27;s 32nd ruler. He is known as the progenitor of Buyeo Seo Clan (부여 서씨/扶餘徐氏) where he changed his surname to Seo.

After his father was overthrown by an alliance of Silla and the Chinese Tang dynasty in 660, Buyeo Yung was sent into exile at the Tang capital Luoyang, along with his father. After the defeat of the Baekje restoration movement led by Boksin and Dochim at the Battle of Baekgang, which had sought to place Yung&#x27;s brother Buyeo Pung on the throne, Tang felt the need for a ruler who could pacify the Baekje area. Beginning in 664, Buyeo Yung served briefly as the governor of the Ungjin Commandery () which Tang established to oversee the former territory of Baekje.

After Silla expelled Tang forces from the Korean peninsula in 676, Buyeo Yung returned to Luoyang, where he spent the rest of his days.

<doc id="1238743" wikidata="Q60742" url="?curid=1238743" title="Emil Maurice">
<text>Emil Maurice (; 19 January 1897 – 6 February 1972) was an early member of the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (Nazi Party) and a founding member of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). He was Hitler&#x27;s first personal chauffeur, and was one of several persons of mixed Jewish and ethnic German ancestry to serve in the SS.

==Early life and association with Hitler==
A watchmaker by trade, Maurice was a close early associate of Adolf Hitler; their personal friendship dated back to 1919 when they were both members of the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP). Maurice officially joined the DAP on 1 December 1919 and his party number was 594 (the count began at 501). With the founding of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; in 1920, Maurice became the first &quot;Oberster SA-Führer&quot; (Supreme SA Leader). Maurice led the SA stormtroopers in some fights with other groups during those early days. Hitler later in his book &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; mentions one fight in particular from November 1921 where Maurice was at the forefront of the SA unit during the fighting.
In July 1921, Maurice became a personal chauffeur for Adolf Hitler. In March 1923, Maurice also became a member of the &quot;Stabswache&quot; (Staff Guard), a small separate bodyguard dedicated to Hitler&#x27;s service rather than &quot;a suspect mass&quot; of the party, such as the SA. It was given the task of guarding Hitler at Nazi parties and rallies. In May 1923, the unit was renamed &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot; (Shock Troop) &#x27;Adolf Hitler&#x27;. Maurice, Julius Schreck, Joseph Berchtold, and Erhard Heiden, were all members of the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;. On 9 November 1923, the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;, along with the SA and several other paramilitary units, took part in the abortive Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. In the aftermath of the putsch, Hitler, Rudolf Hess, Maurice and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison for high treason. The Nazi Party and all associated formations, including the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;, were officially disbanded.
After Hitler&#x27;s release from prison, the Nazi Party was officially refounded. In 1925, Hitler ordered the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; (protection command). It was formed by Julius Schreck and included old &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot; members, Maurice and Heiden. That same year, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; was expanded to a national level. It was renamed successively the &quot;Sturmstaffel&quot; (storm squadron), and finally on 9 November the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). Hitler became SS member No. 1 and Emil Maurice became SS member No. 2. At that time, Maurice became an SS-&quot;Führer&quot; in the new organization, although the leadership of the SS was assumed by Schreck, the first &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;. Maurice became Hitler&#x27;s permanent chauffeur in 1925. Later when Maurice informed Hitler in December 1927 that he was having a relationship with Hitler&#x27;s half-niece Geli Raubal, Hitler forced an end to the affair. Maurice was dismissed from Hitler&#x27;s personal service in 1928, but allowed to remain a member of the SS. As chauffeur, he was succeeded first by Julius Schreck and then Erich Kempka.

When the SS was reorganized and expanded in 1932, Maurice became a senior SS officer and would eventually be promoted to the rank SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot;. While Maurice never became a top commander of the SS, his status as SS member #2 effectively credited him as an actual founder of the organization. Heinrich Himmler, who ultimately would become the most recognized leader of the SS, was SS member #168.

==Conflict with Himmler over Jewish heritage==
After Himmler had become &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, Maurice fell afoul of Himmler&#x27;s racial purity rules for SS officers when he had to submit details of his family history before he was allowed to marry in 1935. Himmler stated, &quot;without question...Maurice is, according to his ancestral table, not of Aryan descent&quot;. All SS officers had to prove racial purity back to 1750, and it turned out that Maurice had one-eighth Jewish ancestry: Charles Maurice Schwartzenberger ( 1805–1896), the founder of the Thalia Theater in Hamburg, was his great-grandfather.

Even though Maurice had been a party member since 1919, taken part in the abortive Beer Hall Putsch (for which he was awarded the prestigious Blood Order), and been a bodyguard for Hitler, Himmler considered him to be a serious security risk given his &quot;Jewish ancestry&quot;. Himmler recommended that Maurice be expelled from the SS, along with other members of his family. To Himmler&#x27;s annoyance, Hitler stood by his old friend. In a secret letter written on 31 August 1935, Hitler compelled Himmler to make an exception for Maurice and his brothers, who were informally declared &quot;Honorary Aryans&quot; and allowed to stay in the SS.

==Later life==
Maurice became engaged on 31 March 1935 to the medical student – later doctor – Hedwig Maria Anna Ploetz, the daughter of Colonel Rudolf Ploetz. They married on 5 November 1935 in Munich. In 1936, he became a Reichstag deputy for Leipzig and from 1937 was the chairman of the Munich Chamber of Commerce. From 1940 to 1942, he served in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; as an officer.

On 25 May 1945, American forces captured Maurice in Starnberg. In 1948, he was tried and sentenced to four years in a labour camp as a &quot;Class II Nazi&quot; (Offender). He returned to his life as a watchmaker and in 1951 owned a watch shop in Munich. He died in Starnberg on 6 February 1972.

<text>Sombras Y Figuras (Shadows and Figures) is the twenty-seventh studio album (18th in Spanish) by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1988 by the Melody record label. The tracklist includes songs from a series of composers who were quite popular at the time, such as the Argentine Miguel Mateos. 

The group members at that time included Ricky Martin, Sergio Blass, Rubén Gómez, Angelo García, and new member Robert Avellanet. Robert replaced Raymond Acevedo after Raymond suddenly quit the band becoming the fourth member (Miguel Cancel 1st, Robby Rosa 2nd, and Ralphy Rodríguez 3rd) ever to do so. 

With the album, Menudo achieved their best commercial performance on the Latin Pop Albums chart of &quot;Billboard&quot; (reaching the Top 20), as well as their second-best performance (reaching the Top 40) during the 1980s, with the single &quot;Historia Del Primer Amor&quot; on the Hot Latin Songs chart of the same magazine.

==Background==

The quintet at this time consisted of singers Ricky Martin, Sergio Blass, Rubén Gómez, Angelo García, and Robert Avellanet, who replaced Raymond Acevedo. Robert, who was 12 years old when he joined the group, is the nephew of Puerto Rican singer Chucho Avellanet, and made his first appearance on the television show &quot;Noche de Gala&quot;.

Raymond Acevedo, a member since 1985, left the band at age 16. The decision was motivated by administrative differences and a lack of security with the new management. The sale of Menudo to Panamanian investors was made in 1987, and the group&#x27;s management had changed the compensation system for the members, from a fixed salary to a percentage of profits. Although Raymond&#x27;s departure was planned for late September or early October, it was brought forward due to these factors. In an interview, the singer&#x27;s father stated that Raymond might consider a return to the entertainment world in the future.

This would be the last album recorded by Ricky Martin as a member of the band. During a press conference at the Melody record label&#x27;s studios in Mexico City, he revealed that his farewell would take place during the promotional tour in Puerto Rico, at a performance scheduled for the last week of July that year (1989), at the Teatro de Bellas Artes de San Juan. In his autobiography, the singer said that the choice of location was perfect, as his first performance had taken place in the same venue.

==Promotion==
In October 1988, the newspaper &quot;La Opinion&quot; reported that the group would be in Mexico the following month to promote the album &quot;Sombras y Figuras&quot; throughout the country. The promotion would include interviews, appearances on television shows and radio, as well as concerts in various cities across the country. According to the publication, at that time, the group would perform with their new member, Roberto Avellanet.

In 1989, the group performed at the Teatro Teresa Carreño during the Prêmios Ronda, where Rawy, Ricky Martin&#x27;s replacement, was also introduced.

==Singles==
The singles &quot;En Mis Sueños&quot; and Niña Luna were released in physical format. The song &quot;Historia Del Primer Amor&quot; reached the Top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart at position 34, staying among the most commercially successful songs for just one week (February 25, 1989). The song &quot;Gafas Oscuras&quot; reached the top positions on music charts in Mexico, and Venezuela.

==Commercial performance==
The album achieved Menudo&#x27;s best commercial performance on the Latin Pop Albums chart of &quot;Billboard&quot;, peaking at number 16 and staying on the chart for thirteen consecutive weeks, the longest duration the group had with one of their albums on the list. According to the book &quot;Menudo: el reencuentro con la verdad&quot;, the album earned a platinum record in less than four weeks for its sales.

<text>Iancu Văcărescu (1786–1863) was a Romanian Wallachian boyar and poet, member of the Văcărescu family.
==Biography==
The son of Alecu Văcărescu, descending from a long line of Wallachian men of letters — his paternal uncle, Ienăchiță Văcărescu, was author of the first Romanian grammar; Iancu was the grandfather of writer Elena Văcărescu. He received a quality education not only in Greek (the preferred language of teaching in Wallachia at the time), but also in German and French, and was well versed in Western literature.

A patriot during the Phanariote epoch, he sided with the national movement in 1821 (around Tudor Vladimirescu&#x27;s Wallachian Uprising), and assisted in establishing the Romanian theatre, translating many books and plays from German and French into Romanian, notably the &quot;Britannicus&quot; of Racine, a literary event of no small importance at the time. He inaugurated modern Romanian poetry.
During the debates in the National Assembly over the drafting of an organic law for the Danubian Principalities (&quot;see Regulamentul Organic&quot;), Văcărescu spoke out against Imperial Russian overseeing, and was placed under arrest before being exiled for the following years.

Văcărescu was also one of the founders of the modern Romanian school system. He wrote philosophical poems, and ballads that found their inspiration in folklore. The first volume of verse he published was in 1830.

Before the 1848 Wallachian revolution, he presided a literary society (&quot;Societatea Literară&quot;) which served as a front for the radical secret association &quot;Frăţia&quot;.

Văcărescu died in 1863.

<text>Damper is a thick home-made bread traditionally prepared by early European settlers in Australia. It is a bread made from wheat-based dough. Flour, salt and water, with some butter if available, is kneaded and baked in the coals of a campfire, either directly or within a camp oven.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;damper&quot; originated as a specific use of the British word &quot;damper&quot;, meaning &quot;something that takes the edge off the appetite&quot;. There was likely also some influence from the phrase &quot;damp down&quot; as in &quot;to damp down a fire&quot;.

When cooked as smaller, individually-sized portions, the damper may be known as &quot;bush scones&quot; or &quot;johnnycakes&quot; (also &quot;johnny cakes&quot;). North American cornmeal bread is also called johnnycake; it is uncertain if this influenced the Australian term. However, Australian johnnycakes, while often pan-fried, remain wheat-based.
The technique of making Johnny cakes on a hotplate is common in the likes of Ireland, so as the Irish etc migrated to US or to penal colonial Australia, so too did their cooking influence. 
The Aboriginal communities have been using the flour of ground seeds mixed with water and cooked on coals to make Mingari (aka Damper) likely since their discovery of grinding stones and fire control.[Citation needed]

== Description ==
Damper was eaten by stockmen who travelled in remote areas for long periods, with only basic rations of flour (much less bulky than baked bread), sugar and tea, supplemented by whatever meat was available. It was also a basic provision of squatters. Damper is generally held to be unleavened and made without added rising agents, but historically, if the bread dough was left overnight, it could sometimes have leavened naturally, and this may have been a commonly understood technique in bush lore. Some recipes added portions of the previous night&#x27;s dough, similar to a sourdough starters. Damper was normally cooked in the ashes of the campfire. Damper could also be cooked in a greased camp oven. Damper was eaten with dried or cooked meat or golden syrup.

Damper is considered quintessentially Australian, and emblematic of early European settlement and rural life there, although this way to make bread was not unique to colonial or pre-colonial Australia. Other cultures have similar hearth breads, and versions of soda or other quick breads are made when camping in many parts of the world, including New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

The bread is different from bush bread, which has been eaten by Indigenous Australians for thousands of years, traditionally made by crushing a variety of native seeds, nuts and roots, and mixing them into a dough baked in the coals of a fire. There are studies into whether this technique of various Aboriginal peoples influenced the development of colonial-era damper, similarly cooked in the ashes of a camp fire.

<text>Reaching Out is the fourteenth studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1984 by RCA. The album stands out as their first English record in their discography, and marks the group&#x27;s phonographic debut in Brazil. This lineup featured members Ricky (16), Charlie (15), Ray (14), Roy (14), and new member Robby (14). The latter replaced Johnny Lozada after he reached the group&#x27;s age limit of 16.

The album&#x27;s songs consist of tracks selected from their last four Spanish language albums, translated into English, with the exception of the original song &quot;Like A Cannonball,&quot; recorded for the soundtrack of Burt Reynolds’ film &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;. In addition to the mentioned track, singles included &quot;If You&#x27;re Not Here (By My Side)&quot;, &quot;Heavenly Angel,&quot;, and &quot;Motorcycle Dreamer.&quot;

The album received a positive reception from audiences and critics alike. Sales surpassed 425,000 copies in the United States and 1 million in Brazil, earning it a diamond certification in the latter.

==Background and production== 
The album was the group’s first release after signing a six-year deal (for 12 LPs) with RCA, valued at a multimillion-dollar amount comparable to artists such as Kenny Rogers and Diana Ross. The campaign supporting their first English album was part of the label&#x27;s strategy to expand its market beyond its southern borders, particularly targeting American audiences. By 1983, Menudo had already sold 750,000 copies of all their albums in the U.S., while their next album, &quot;A Todo Rock&quot;, sold 250,000 copies in the country within a month.

The success of this transition greatly depended on the group&#x27;s ability to sing well in English, prompting the members to undergo an intensive language training program aimed at minimizing any traces of a Spanish accent. The group even recorded the English version of the theme song for the film *Cannonball Run II*, starring Burt Reynolds. Another challenge identified was maintaining the group&#x27;s popularity in a volatile market, especially considering the rotation of members since Menudo&#x27;s concept involved replacing members as they aged. According to music critic Stephen Holden, although this formula could theoretically ensure eternal youth, concerns remained about the durability of their music, which followed a pre-packaged pop style that limited its longevity in the music market. Beyond the album, RCA planned the release of two music videos directed by Paquito Cordero, who also produced TV specials featuring the group.

As written in the LP&#x27;s credit section: &quot;Reaching Out&quot; was a collaborative production, arranged and conducted by Alejandro Monroy and Carlos Villa. The main production was handled by Edgardo Díaz, with additional contributions by Mary Lynne M. Pagan. Vocal recordings were engineered by Jaime Camacho, while José Vinader managed the music engineering. Carlos Martos was responsible for the album&#x27;s mixing.

==Promotion== 
On October 19, 1984, TV Globo aired a special titled &quot;Menudo Especial&quot;, in which eight of the ten songs from &quot;Reaching Out&quot; were performed live. The recordings took place during the &quot;II Festival Internacional do Menudo&quot;, held in August 1984 in Puerto Rico.

The group performed ten sold-out shows at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

==Singles== 
&quot;If You&#x27;re Not Here (By My Side)&quot; was released as a single in 1983. The track is the English version of the Spanish single &quot;Si Tú No Estás,&quot; featured on the 1983 album &quot;A Todo Rock&quot;. This love song features Robby Rosa as the lead vocalist. According to &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine, the song &quot;features a classic pop melody sung by a youthful, high-pitched, and exceptionally clear male voice, accompanied by an orchestral background with 101 string instruments.&quot; In the United States, the song reached number 36 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.

In Brazil, the song was included in the soundtrack of the TV Globo soap opera &quot;Partido Alto&quot;, serving as the theme for the character Fernando, played by Roberto Bataglin. According to &quot;Veja&quot; magazine, the song &quot;topped the charts as one of the most played songs on FM radio stations across the country.&quot; The single sold 270,000 copies in Brazil, and reached number one on the Nelson Oliveira Pesquisa e Estudo de Mercado (Nopem) list.

According to the &quot;Correio Braziliense&quot; newspaper, the songs &quot;If You&#x27;re Not Here,&quot; &quot;Heavenly Angel,&quot; and &quot;Because of Love&quot; were frequently requested on the radio in 1985, even though the group had released a more recent album in the country.

==Critical reception==

Reviews from music critics were mostly favorable.

Although AllMusic did not publish a written review, the site rated the album four out of five stars. Sérgio Nona from the &quot;Diário de Pernambuco&quot; described the album as very well-produced, with joyful songs likely to appeal to both adults and children.

Journalist Tárik de Souza from &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot; noted that the album mixes rock and ballads in the &quot;shrill voices&quot; of the quintet, accompanied by a &quot;standardized and outdated&quot; sonic backdrop. He mentioned that the track &quot;Motorcycle Dreamer&quot; &quot;is the album&#x27;s sole moment where the drums break free from the danceable constraints for a brief dry solo,&quot; but he pointed out that the group was far from artists like The Beatles, to whom they were often compared.

==Commercial performance==
The album peaked at number 108 on the Billboard 200, becoming the group&#x27;s first album to chart in the United States. According to *&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;*, the album&#x27;s and singles&#x27; modest success on U.S. charts did not prevent the group from becoming &quot;a cultural phenomenon driven by marketing prowess and the sale of essential non-musical merchandise.&quot;

In Brazil, it appeared on the Nopem charts as one of the best-selling albums. By mid-1985, *&quot;Billboard&quot;* reported sales of 425,000 copies in the country. According to &quot;Jornal dos Sports&quot; on March 28, 1985, after their final concert in São Paulo, the group received a diamond disc from the vice president of RCA International&#x27;s Latin American Division for selling 1 million copies of the album.

<text>The Constitution of the State of Tennessee defines the form, structure, activities, character, and fundamental rules (and means for changing them) of the U.S. State of Tennessee.

The original constitution of Tennessee came into effect on June 1, 1796, concurrent with the state&#x27;s admission to the Union. A second version of the constitution was adopted in 1835. A third constitution was adopted in 1870 and is the one still in use today, with subsequent amendments. The constitution is located in Tennessee&#x27;s State Library and Archives.

==History==
===1796 constitution===
Tennessee held a convention in 1796 to frame their first constitution. The original Tennessee state constitution was not submitted to the voters for approval, but it was approved by US Congress, in conjunction with the resolution admitting Tennessee as a state. It went into effect on June 1, 1796, when Tennessee entered the Union.

The first constitution was widely criticized as giving the executive, presumably a full-time governor, insufficient authority, and investing too much authority in the legislature a part-time body. That was cited as a primary reason for its replacement.

The 1796 constitution also did not create a state supreme court, providing only for &quot;such superior and inferior courts&quot; as the legislature should create, with judges elected by the legislature for indefinite terms.

In spite of its shortcomings, the original document had its admirers. Thomas Jefferson described Tennessee&#x27;s as the &quot;least imperfect and most republican of the state constitutions.&quot;

===1835 constitution===

The second Tennessee State Constitution, adopted in 1835, resulted from a state constitutional convention that convened in Nashville on May 19, 1834, with 60 delegates in attendance. William Carter, of Carter County, presided over the 1834 convention.

Antislavery interests petitioned the convention to abolish slavery, which was rejected by the convention delegates. The constitution adopted increased opportunities for citizens to engage in the political process, but it limited suffrage to white males. Similarly to other southern states, such as Virginia, it disfranchised free black men, who had had the right to vote under the 1796 constitution. That followed fears raised by Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion in 1831.

The second constitution provided for a state supreme court, with three judges, with one judge from each grand division of the state. Judges were required to be at least 35 years old and would serve 12-year terms.

The constitution was ratified by voters in March 1835, receiving 42,666 votes for it and 17,691 against it.

===1870 constitution===
The Tennessee General Assembly, on November 15, 1869, called for an election to be held in December 1869 for two purposes: to determine if a constitutional convention should be called to amend or replace the 1835 constitution and to elect delegates to that convention if the voters determined that it was to be held. The voters decided for the convention, which began on January 10, 1870. The convention adjourned on February 23, 1870, after adopting the constitution and recommending its approval by the voters in a special election, which was conducted on March 26, 1870.

The third document was largely written as a response to the requirement for all ex-Confederates to adopt new constitutions explicitly banning slavery. It contains many provisions that are verbatim holdovers from the two predecessor documents. It is considerably longer than the federal constitution but is not particularly long by the standards of state constitutions. This 1870 document stood unamended until 1953, which, according to the Tennessee Blue Book, was the longest period that any such document had remained in effect without amendment anywhere in the world.
Tennessee held limited constitutional conventions in 1953, 1959, 1965, 1971, and 1977.

==Main provisions==
The constitution&#x27;s preamble is much longer than its counterpart in the federal Constitution. Much of that length is devoted to justifying the authority behind the new constitution: that the new constitution was created under the authority of the constitution of 1835, which was itself created under the authority of the 1796 convention.

===Declaration of Rights===
Article I, is Tennessee&#x27;s bill of rights. It mimics many of the US Bill of Rights, but the provisions describing them are generally much lengthier. The provisions in this article state:

Sections 16 and 27 are among those directly copied from the federal Constitution. Section 8 closely follows the wording of the Magna Carta.

The article&#x27;s provisions regarding slavery are also significant, as they both prohibit slavery in the same manner as the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and forbid the legislature from making any &quot;law recognizing the right of property in man.&quot; Some construe the latter provision as prohibiting any form of indentured servitude. 

====Less usual declarations====
Besides the more common rights, a few other rights are enumerated:

* Citizens are granted &quot;an unalienable and indefeasible right to alter, reform, or abolish the government in such manner as they may think proper&quot; (Section 1).
* Imprisonment for civil debt may not be carried out (Section 18).
* Martial law may never be declared (Section 25)
* Anyone may travel on the Mississippi River, and the right to do so may not be sold to or barred from anyone (Section 29).

===Separation of powers===
====Legislative branch====
The lawmaking power of the state is given to its Legislature, named the General Assembly. The upper house is the Senate and the lower house is the House of Representatives (Section 3).

The basis for legislative representation is population, as determined by the US Census; however the General Assembly can always use other, non-population factors to apportion one house (the Senate) unless the US Constitution is currently authoritatively interpreted to forbid that, as it currently is under &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (Section 4).

The lower house is fixed at 99 members, which are to be divided up among counties; if one county has more than one representative (which is guaranteed to happen, as there are 95 counties), the affected counties shall be divided up into districts, causing all representatives to be elected from single-member constituencies. A county may not be split into separate counties to do that (Section 5 and subsection).

The upper house is to be set up in the same manner, but its size is variable, up to a third of the size of the lower house, which was fixed at 99, as noted above. In practice, the Tennessee Senate always had 33 members, the maximum allowed (Section 6 and subsection).

The first election to the Legislature was to take place on the second Tuesday of November 1870 and then every two years, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday, and all such elections shall take place only on that day (Section 7).

Representatives have to be 21 years old, US citizens, state citizens for three years, and county citizens for at least one year before election day (Section 9). Senatorial requirements are different only in that senators must be at least 30 years old. Also, no one from either house may be appointed to any office by the executive or legislative branches unless it is as a &quot;trustee of a literary institution&quot; (Section 10).

Both houses may imprison people (whether a member or not) who disrupts their proceedings (Section 14).

The legislative provisions include the requirement that no bill may be broader than its caption, and it may have only one subject (Section 17). Tennessee courts have interpreted that to mean that no bill can contain non-germane material, and no caption can include the words &quot;and for other purposes&quot; (unlike in Congress). The General Assembly, therefore, can pass no &quot;omnibus&quot; bills.

Also banned were some business practices that had previously gotten the state into trouble, such as allowing municipalities to lend money to railroads for them to pay off bonds on which they had previously defaulted (Section 33) and the election or appointment of people who were still responsible for public money (Section 25).

Section 28 describes the General Assembly&#x27;s power to levy taxes.

For a municipality to issue bonds or borrow money on behalf of a private business or individual, the passage of a referendum was required, with the unusually stringent provision of a three-quarters majority, but that was to be delayed for ten years in 26 named counties, where the requirement would be a simple majority until then. The period between May 6, 1861 and January 1, 1867 was not to be counted against any statute of limitations, as civil government in much of the state had broken down during that period because of the American Civil War.

====Executive branch====
Article III allows the governor to serve a two-year term, which was superseded by 1953 amendments. The executive branch is empowered with a line-item veto, but a majority of all members in each house may override the veto, which is the same vote required to enact the bill initially. The governor is the head of the state militia, but he may not exercise that power unless the General Assembly authorizes him to do so when &quot;the public safety requires it&quot; (Section 5).

There are twenty-two departments that operate under the executive branch; the departments are:
* Department of Agriculture
* Department of Children&#x27;s Services
* Department of Commerce and Insurance
* Department of Correction
* Department of Economic and Community Development
* Department of Education
* Department of Environment and Conservation
* Department of Finance and Administration
* Department of Financial Institutions
* Department of General Services
* Department of Health
* Department of Human Resources
* Department of Human Services
* Department of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
* Department of Labor and Workforce Development
* Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services
* Department of Military
* Department of Revenue
* Department of Safety and Homeland Security
* Department of Tourist Development
* Department of Transportation
* Department of Veterans Services

====Judicial branch====
Article VI creates the judiciary, with the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Chancery courts, and others to be &quot;ordained and established&quot; as deemed necessary as well as justices of the peace (Section 1).

The Tennessee Supreme Court is to meet in Nashville, Knoxville, and Jackson. Only two of its five members may be from any one of the state&#x27;s Grand Divisions (East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and West Tennessee) (Section 2). The courts were elected by the people for eight years at a time (Sections 3 and 4), but that has been changed to the Tennessee Plan.

The court then appoints the state &quot;Attorney General and Reporter&quot; for an eight-year term (Section 5).

The General Assembly may remove judges and state attorneys with a two-thirds supermajority of the constitutionally authorized membership in both houses, with each vote for and against being recorded along with the individual reason for his decision. Removal will lie for either official or personal misconduct. The judge or attorney subject to removal must be notified ten days before such a vote (Section 6).

Alternatively, judges and state attorneys may be impeached by a simple majority vote of a quorum of the General Assembly for crimes or misconduct committed solely in their official capacity. Then, the lower house appoints three members to prosecute the impeached, and the senate, presided over by the Chief Justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court, convenes to try the impeached. Conviction requires only a two-thirds supermajority of the number of senators &quot;sworn to try the impeachment,&quot; which may be less than a &quot;constitutional&quot; supermajority (Article V).

Judges are also barred from hearing cases of impeachment. Criminal charges after removal from office would result only from a separate trial of fact in the state&#x27;s ordinary courts.

==Other provisions==
The constitution has several provisions that are unusual for a state constitution. It mandates only three constitutional officers other than governor: the secretary of state, state treasurer, and comptroller, who are elected by the General Assembly, not the voters as is far more common. Tennessee is the only state other than Hawaii and, arguably, New Jersey in which the governor is the sole office holder elected statewide (the Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is elected as part of a ticket alongside the governor).

The governor&#x27;s designated successor is the Speaker of the Tennessee State Senate, elected from among its membership, a provision now found in the constitutions of only a few other states; most now have a full-time lieutenant governor. (The office is referred to as Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee in subsequent statutory law, but not in the constitution.)

General elections for state offices were moved to make them simultaneous with federal elections (November in even-numbered years), with elections for county and judicial offices to be held in August of even-numbered years; that later became the traditional date for primary elections for the statewide offices to be held as well so that the day on which, for example, a sheriff was elected would be the same day as the primary election for governor would be held.

Other provisions included are the procedure for the establishment of new counties and the recognition of three counties previously established by the legislature, in contravention of provisions of the previous constitution. New counties would carry a pro-rata share of the indebtedness of the county or counties from which they were being formed, preventing the formation of new counties as a way of areas getting out from under debt that they had previously incurred.

(That provision nonetheless incited a spate of new counties; ten were established in the next decade, but none have been since, and one of those established was subsequently abolished, and the provisions are such that would make the establishment of any further counties beyond those extremely difficult and unlikely.) 

Some current agendas of the era were reflected, as there were provisions allowing county seats to be moved in two counties with only a majority vote of the populace, but a two-thirds majority was required in all others. A county line adjustment between two counties was made between two existing counties, and special provisions made for counties whose formation was already planned at the time as well as for settling definitively the status of others that had already been created without strict adherence to the provisions for the creation of new counties contained in the previous constitution.

There were also provisions forbidding interracial marriages and integrated schools, allowing for a poll tax, preventing interest over 10% from being charged on loans and making this usury &quot;per se&quot;. All four provisions have been either subsequently formally removed or otherwise invalidated by Supreme Court of the United States decisions and are no longer enforced. Whether the prohibition of former duelists from holding office is valid has apparently not been tested.

===Militia===
The state&#x27;s militia is governed by Article VIII, which specifies that all officers are to be elected by those subject to service within their groupings and as the legislature directs (Section 1) but that the governor will appoint his staff officers, who, in turn, appoints their staff officers (Section 2). The legislature is also directed to exempt religious conscientious objectors (Section 3).

===Disqualifications===
Article IX lists three groups of people who are barred from various privileges:

* Ministers of any religion may not sit as legislators because they &quot;ought not be diverted from the great duties of their functions&quot; (Section 1).
* Atheists may not perform any office in the government, but Section 4 of Article I, banning any religious test for any &quot;office of public trust&quot;, would make this impossible to enforce (Section 2).
* Any person involved in a duel may not hold any &quot;honor or profit&quot; under the state&#x27;s government and is liable to be punished otherwise (Section 3).

The restrictions on ministers and atheists have been deemed to be unenforceable due to the interpretations of the Supreme Court of the United States with regard to the First and the Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

Impeachment

Article V of the Tennessee Constitution states that only the House of Representatives has the power to impeach (Section 1). Impeachment is when an office holder&#x27;s actions are called into question, so therefore, they face the chances of being removed from office. The process of impeachment it is tried in the Senate, and all senators must be sworn under oath. The chief justice of the Supreme Court presides overall all trials of impeachment unless he is on trial, then the senior associate judge will rule over the court. The office holder can not be convicted without a two-thirds or majority rule from the Senate (Section 2). The House of Representatives must choose three members to prosecute impeachments. Impeachments can not be tried until the Legislature has adjourned &quot;sine die,&quot; then the Senate can try the impeachment (Section 3). The governor, Supreme Court Judges, inferior court judges, chancellors, attorneys of the state, treasurer, comptroller, and secretary of state are all liable to impeachment if the House of Representative believe they have committed a crime that calls for disqualification or removal from office, but judgement can only be removal of office and disqualification to hold any office after impeachment. The party must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, and the Legislature has the power to remove penalties imposed on anyone disqualified from filling office by impeachment (Section 4). Justices of the peace, and other civil officers are also liable for indictments in such courts as the Legislature may direct, and if convicted of impeachment they must be removed from office by said court, and will be subject to other punishment as asserted by law (Section 5).

==Amendment process==
Article XI, Section 3 of the Tennessee State Constitution gives two methods to amend the document:

===Legislative method===
Under the legislative method, which is a very lengthy process, the General Assembly must pass a resolution, calling for an amendment and stating its wording, and it must do so in three separate readings on three separate days, with an absolute majority on all readings. The resolution does not require the governor&#x27;s approval.

The amendment must then be published at least six months before the next legislative election, but it is not then placed on the ballot. Instead, once the legislative election is held, the proposed amendment must go another three readings, a three-day voting process. Then, the amendment now requires approval of two-thirds of the legislature on each vote.

Finally, the amendment is placed on the ballot as a referendum, coinciding with the next gubernatorial election. For the amendment to pass, the number of &quot;yes&quot; votes must both be greater than &quot;no&quot; votes and must equal &quot;a majority of all the citizens of the state voting for governor.&quot;

===Convention method===
Under the convention method, the legislature can put on any ballot the question of whether to call a constitutional convention. The question must state whether the convention is limited (to make amendments to the existing constitution) or unlimited (to propose an entirely new constitution). If the convention is limited, the question must state the provisions of the current constitution that are to be subject to amendment, and the subsequent convention, if approved, is limited to considering only the amendments to the provisions that are specified in the call.

The proposed amendments (or new constitution) must then be placed on the ballot and receive a simple majority.

A constitutional convention may not be held more frequently than once every six years.

==Amendments==
===First amendments===
The record length of time for going unamended ended in 1953. In 1952, the legislature called for a convention, and the voters approved it. Voters then approved the recommended amendments. The most noticeable change in the 1953 amendments was a lengthening of the governor&#x27;s term from two to four years, but no governor could succeed himself anymore. (Until it was subsequently amended again, in 1978, the provision was to establish what critics derisively called &quot;leapfrog government.&quot;)

Another provision allowed for the consolidation of a county government with the government of a county&#x27;s main city, in the four largest counties.

The convention also established precedents that later proved useful. Since no one who served in the 1870 convention, which wrote the constitution, was still alive, many administrative measures had to be decided, such as what rules the convention would function under temporarily until it was organized and adopted its own permanent rules and how a chair was to be elected.

Also, the constitution was decided to be compiled in a manner similar to statutory law, unlike the federal constitution. Thus, that amendments actually replace the language that they alter in the document, and future publications would have amendments integrated into the text rather than appended to it as &quot;Amendment I,&quot; &quot;Amendment II,&quot; etc. Thus, someone reading the text of the state constitution can, absent a strong historical background, sometimes be confused as to the provisions that are those of the original document and the ones that are the result of later amendment, but some amendments declare themselves to be such within the text of their provisions.

That does prevent a reader of the current constitution from being confused by encountering obsolete provisions that have since been changed and not reading on to the end of the document to establish that fact, which is sometimes done to the federal constitution by those wishing to obscure its current provisions, such as those who assert that the document considers slaves as three-fifths of a person, which has not applied since the American Civil War but is still in the text of the early part of the document. The amendment changes that are not encountered until much later in the text.

Further amendments to the state constitution were proposed and then adopted at conventions, held in 1959 and 1965. Among the most notable are for the establishment of home rule by counties that chose to adopt a charter so they can function in many ways similar to municipalities.

The amendments also allowed legislators to receive a salary besides expense money and extended the terms of state senators from two years to four, but only half of its membership is elected every two years. Another important change was that the frequency of scheduled sessions of the legislature and thus the budget cycle was altered from biennial to annual, but the General Assembly is still limited to a total of fifteen organizational days and ninety legislative days every two year. Sessions extending that time and special sessions extending beyond twenty legislative days result in the legislature being unable to continue to receive its expense &quot;per diem&quot;.

The poll tax provisions, already rendered moot, were removed. The 1971 convention, dominated by longtime Tennessee politician Clifford Allen, was limited to the establishment of a new system of property tax assessments.

===1977 convention and aftermath===
The 1977 convention was the broadest call since the original writing of the constitution, in 1870. It was called in part to remove long-unenforceable provisions such as those banning interracial marriage and school desegregation but primarily at the behest of banking interests to remove the 10% cap on interest, which was becoming very problematic in the economic environment of the time. (It had long been circumvented by smaller lenders such as finance companies with tactics such as administration fees, service charges, and payment fees, with tacit legislative approval.)

This convention proved to be very long and contentious and even lasted nearly twice as long as the original one that wrote the 1870 constitution. There were major fights over the adoption of the permanent rules and over who would be the permanent chair. Although that seemed to bode ill, once the convention got on track, it accomplished what many legal scholars see as being a record of largely solid achievement.

A major change was the proposal that the governor could now succeed himself once. A two-term governor was also not barred from any future service in that office in the way that a two-term US President is by the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution for life, only from a third &quot;consecutive&quot; term.

Any county and its principal city could vote to consolidate themselves into one &quot;metropolitan government&quot;. Only three counties have done so: Nashville and Davidson County; Hartsville and Trousdale County; Lynchburg and Moore County.

Minor other changes included the elimination of the necessity of each county having the archaic (at least for urban counties) offices of constable and cattle ranger. (The provision for rangers was routinely widely ignored; but not the one mandating constables.) The provision limiting sheriffs to three consecutive two-year terms was replaced with one allowing sheriffs an unlimited number of consecutive four-year terms. That provision was called by some wags the &quot;Fate Thomas Amendment&quot;, as it seemed to have been passed largely at the behest at the then hugely popular sheriff and political boss of Davidson County, who was otherwise about to be term-limited out of office but achieved re-election under the provisions of the amendment. Eventually, Thomas served federal time for corruption-related offenses.

Some in the mass media derided the convention as having gone out of control, but the primary public reaction was one of apathy. The primary controversy within the convention once it began its actual work, as opposed to its early difficulties, was over a judicial amendment that would have made the state attorney general an office elected by statewide popular vote rather than retaining selection by the Supreme Court, and it would have also eliminated the requirement for the Supreme Court to meet in Knoxville and Jackson, where a new and elaborate building for it had just been completed. Another important provision of the proposed amendment was to repeal the 1870 Constitution&#x27;s requirement that all judges &quot;shall be elected&quot; in favor of a provision stating that &quot;Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals shall be appointed by the Governor from three nominees recommended... by the Appellate Court Nominating Commission... The name of each justice and judge seeking retention shall be submitted to the qualified voters for retention or rejection... at the expiration of each six year term.&quot;

The voters, in a special election held March 7, 1978, solely to ratify the amendments proposed by the convention, voted to remove the archaic provisions and the usury cap and to accept the changes regarding the governor&#x27;s terms and metropolitan government, but they narrowly turned down the judicial amendment, marking the first time that an amendment put to the voters by a convention had been defeated. Of the 13 proposed amendments, only that one was rejected by the voters.

No further conventions have been held since 1977, but they have been frequently proposed, in part because of the recent spate of state fiscal crises. Some have proposed conventions to determine conclusively whether or not the Tennessee Constitution allows a general, broad-based income tax on wages. It has been suggested by several observers that one reason against the General Assembly requesting future conventions is that they do not desire to create potential new rivals for themselves; as the members themselves cannot be delegates to the convention, in calling for a convention, they are creating a potential new set of politicians campaigning in their same districts and addressing some of the same issues. That occurred to an extent after the 1977 convention, which launched the career, among others, of Memphis attorney Steve Cohen, who was vice president of the convention and later became a prominent progressive Democrat in the Tennessee State Senate, until 2006, when he was elected U.S. Representative from the Ninth District.

===Recent amendments===
Beginning in the 1990s, amendments were placed on the ballot without a convention being held, using, for the first time, the provisions that allow the General Assembly to propose amendments directly.

In 1998, voters were asked about two amendments. One was the Victims&#x27; Rights Amendment, which required prosecutors to stay in touch with crime victims and their families, to explain to them how purported offenses involving them were to be prosecuted, and to notify them when persons who had committed crimes against them were being scheduled for parole or release, among other provisions. The other amendment removed the word &quot;comfortable&quot; from the requirements for minimum standards for prisons. Both of these amendments passed by overwhelming margins in an election marked by a very light turnout. The amendments represented the first changes to the constitution in 20 years.

In 2002, the legislature again proposed two amendments. The first proposal passed, repealing a constitutional ban on all lotteries. The ban had been a carryover from the 1835 document and was widely regarded as a tribute not only to religious fundamentalism but also to the influence of Andrew Jackson, a known lottery opponent, who was in no way averse to other forms of gambling, especially that regarding horse racing. The amendment established the current state lottery.

The other amendment on the 2002 ballot, pushed for by the Tennessee Municipal League (TML), would have eliminated a constitutional provision that set $50 (a large sum in 1870 when the provision was enacted) as the maximum allowable fine for violation of a municipal ordinance. Instead, it would have allowed the legislature to set limits on the fines that municipalities could enact. However, after putting much effort into getting the legislature to put this amendment onto the ballot, the TML put little effort into winning voter approval, and the proposal was largely overlooked during the public debate over the high-profile lottery amendment. Many voters were unaware of the proposal until they were confronted with it on the ballot and so may have turned it down for that reason. It became the first amendment put forward by the General Assembly to be defeated at the polls; it was, other than the proposed 1978 judicial amendment, the only one ever defeated.

In 2006, two additional amendments to the Tennessee State Constitution were passed. The Tennessee Marriage Protection Amendment specifies that only marriages between a man and a woman can be legally recognized in the state of Tennessee. The amendment was approved by 81% of Tennesseans participating in the vote, which was 30.91% of eligible voters that year. A second amendment, authorizing the legislature to enact legislation allowing counties and municipalities to exempt people over 65 from property tax increases, was approved by 83% of voters.

In 2007, the Tennessee House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution calling for an amendment to establish the right to hunt, fish, and harvest game &quot;subject to reasonable rules and regulations,&quot; but the State Senate did not act on the measure during the 2007 legislative session. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) had raised objections to an earlier version of the measure, which had the backing of the National Rifle Association. The TWRA was concerned that the proposal would prevent it from continuing its regulation of hunting and fishing methods as well as efforts to manage fish and game populations.

In 2010, 90% of voters approved the following: &quot;The citizens of this state shall have the personal right to hunt and fish, subject to reasonable regulations and restrictions prescribed by law. The recognition of this right does not abrogate any private or public property rights, nor does it limit the state&#x27;s power to regulate commercial activity. Traditional manners and means may be used to take non-threatened species.&quot;

In 2014, voters approved this amendment: &quot;Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion. The people retain the right through their elected state representatives and state senators to enact, amend, or repeal statues regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother.&quot; This amendment overturns a 2000 Tennessee Supreme Court ruling, &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Sundquist&quot;.

As well, a ban on income tax being levied against earned income (as opposed to interest and dividends, which are still subject to income tax); a change in the judiciary selection/retention process to make the Tennessee Plan explicitly constitutional; and allowing veterans organizations to host gambling fundraisers all passed in 2014.

The 2022 Tennessee Amendment 1, also known as the &quot;Right-to-Work Amendment&quot;, is a right-to-work law amendment that was passed in 2022. The amendment added language to the constitution to make it illegal, along as a constitutional right, for workplaces to require mandatory labor union membership for employees as a condition for employment.

<text>Abies concolor, the white fir, concolor fir, or Colorado fir, is a coniferous tree in the pine family Pinaceae. This tree is native to the mountains of western North America, including the Sierra Nevada and southern Rocky Mountains, and into the isolated mountain ranges of southern Arizona, New Mexico, and Northern Mexico. It naturally occurs at elevations between .

It is popular as an ornamental landscaping tree and as a Christmas tree.

== Description ==
This large evergreen conifer grows best in the central Sierra Nevada of California, where the record specimen was recorded as tall and measured in diameter at breast height (dbh) in Yosemite National Park. The typical size of white fir ranges from tall and up to dbh. The largest specimens are found in the central Sierra Nevada, where the largest diameter recorded was found in Sierra National Forest at (1972); the west slope of the Sierra Nevada is also home to the tallest specimen on record, in height. &quot;Abies concolor&quot; subsp. &quot;concolor&quot; (Rocky mountain white fir) rarely exceeds tall or dbh. Large (but not huge) trees in good soil range from tall and from dbh in California and southwestern Oregon and to tall and dbh in Arizona and New Mexico. The dead tree tops sometimes fork into new growth.

The gray bark is usually at least thick, and brown-hued inside. The leaves are needle-like, flattened, long and wide by thick, green to glaucous blue-green above, and with two glaucous blue-white bands of stomatal bloom below, and slightly notched to bluntly pointed at the tip. The leaf arrangement is spiral on the shoot, but with each leaf variably twisted at the base so they all lie in either two more-or-less flat ranks on either side of the shoot, or upswept across the top of the shoot but not below the shoot.

The cones are long and broad, green or purple ripening pale brown, with about 100–150 scales; the scale bracts are short, and hidden in the closed cone. The winged seeds are released when the cones disintegrate at maturity about 6 months after pollination.

White fir can live over 300 years.

=== Subspecies ===
As treated here, there are two subspecies; these are also variously treated at either the lower rank of variety by some authors, or as distinct species by others:
== Botanical collection ==
White fir was first collected by Augustus Fendler on his expedition to the Santa Fe area of New Mexico in 1846–1847. Fendler&#x27;s patron George Engelmann, a St. Louis area physician and botanist, then described the plant. This tree was first collected in California by William Lobb on his expedition to California of 1849–1853, after it was overlooked by David Douglas in his 1825–1827 expedition to the Pacific coast region.

The specific epithet &quot;concolor&quot; means &quot;all one color&quot;.

== Distribution ==
This tree is native to the mountains of western North America from the southern Cascade Range in Oregon, south throughout California and into the Sierra de San Pedro Mártir in northern Baja California, and south throughout the Colorado Plateau and southern Rocky Mountains in Utah and Colorado, and into the isolated mountain ranges of southern Arizona, New Mexico, and Northern Mexico. It naturally occurs between above sea level.

== Ecology ==
White fir is very closely related to grand fir (&quot;Abies grandis&quot;), and intergrades with it in central Oregon. It is also suggested that all of subspecies lowiana has experienced genetic introgression from grand fir. White fir occupies a different niche than grand fir, including dryer and higher elevation sites, being more drought tolerant and having thicker, fire-resistant bark. In Mexico, it is replaced by further close relatives, Durango fir (&quot;A. durangensis&quot;) and Mexican fir (&quot;A. mexicana&quot;).

Like grand fir, white fir is more shade tolerant than Douglas fir, but less so than western hemlock and western redcedar. White fir is a climax species, which means the forest has reached complex maturity in forest succession in western coniferous forests of the U.S. White fir and yellow pine (ponderosa pine/Jeffrey pine) have co-existed for millennia in old growth forests throughout their range. In the presence of logging of large diameter trees and exclusion of cleansing wildfires, young trees have become abundant over the past two centuries. White fir had been regarded as a pest in the past by those in the lumber industry, but this opinion has changed. White fir is now one of the most important of all commercial softwoods according to the Western Wood Products Association.

The white fir trait of retaining lower limbs creates an escape route for medium-to-small forest birds (such as spotted owl) from larger flying predators and provides a drip zone around the roots for collecting moisture. The retained limbs can become a fuel ladder that allows flames to climb up to the canopy. Limbing-up white fir, instead of removing medium to large diameter trees, in areas where the public is more likely to start fires can help keep other trees and specifically giant sequoia from experiencing canopy fire. Recent concern for sequoia groves has caused agencies to call for removal of white fir in the Sierra Nevada. While sequoia seedlings and young saplings are highly susceptible to mortality or serious injury by fire; mature sequoias are fire adapted with: fire-resistant bark, elevated canopies, self-pruning lower branches, latent buds, and serotinous cones. The sequoia ecosystem is incomplete without the mixed pine/fir and oak that make up the mid and understory. Giant Sequoia&#x27;s cones release seeds when the heat of fire triggers them to open while the thick bark protects the inner cambium from fire damage.

This tree is host to fir mistletoe (&quot;Phoradendron pauciflorum&quot;), a parasitic plant. It is attacked by many types of insects, such as the fir engraver (&quot;Scolytus ventralis&quot;).

=== Dependent species ===
Mature white fir–yellow pine forests support old-growth dependent wildlife species such as California spotted owl (&quot;Strix occidentalis occidentalis&quot;), Mount Pinos sooty grouse (&quot;Dendragapus fuliginosus howardi&quot;), and Pacific fisher (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;). The spotted owl and fisher utilize cavities in decadent large-diameter white fir for nesting and denning. The Mount Pinos sooty grouse requires large diameter trees for thermal cover and its winter diet consists of mostly white fir and yellow pine needles. This subspecies of sooty grouse has been extirpated along with a significant number of large diameter white fir from much of its range. Other subspecies of sooty grouse also utilize Douglas fir, which does not occur in the range of Mount Pinos sooty grouse. Squirrel also frequent the tree&#x27;s branches.

Deer browse the foliage of this species and porcupines chew the bark. Songbirds, grouse, and various mammals eat the seeds.

== Uses ==
White fir and grand fir were used by Native Americans for medicinal use involving powdered bark or pitch to treat tuberculosis or skin ailments. The Nlaka&#x27;pamux used the bark to cover lodges and make canoes. Branches were also used as bedding.

White fir is a preferred construction species because of its nail-holding ability, lightness in weight, and resistance to split, twist, and pitch. It is straight-grained, non-resinous, fine-textured, stiff, and strong.

It is popular as a Christmas tree and for Christmas decoration owing to its soft needles, generally excellent needle retention and abundance. It is often marketed as concolor or white fir.

===Cultivation===
White fir is widely planted as an ornamental tree in parks and larger gardens, particularly some cultivars of subsp. &quot;concolor&quot; selected for very bright glaucous blue foliage, such as cv. &#x27;Violacea&#x27;. The dwarf cultivar &#x27;Compacta&#x27;, growing to a maximum height and spread of , has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>Whitchurch Bridge is a toll bridge that carries the B471 road over the River Thames in England. It links the villages of Pangbourne in Berkshire, and Whitchurch-on-Thames in Oxfordshire – crossing the river just downstream of Whitchurch Lock. It is one of two remaining private toll bridges across the Thames, the other being Swinford Toll Bridge. The bridge has a weight limit of 7.5 tonnes and is a Grade II listed structure. Its 1792-built, now unrelated, residential toll house is also listed.

The bridge is owned and maintained by &quot;The Company of Proprietors of Whitchurch Bridge&quot;, who are themselves owned by the General Estates Company, who also own Bathampton Toll Bridge across the River Avon to the east of Bath. Tolls currently range from 60p for cars to £4 for vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes. Pedestrians, cyclists and motorcycles cross for free. A pre-paid multiple-use Bridge Card can be bought that provides cost savings on tolls.

The Thames Path crosses the river on Whitchurch Bridge. In the downstream (easterly) direction the path passes along the southern bank of the Thames through Pangbourne Meadow. In the upstream (westerly) direction it takes a more inland route through Hartslock on the north side of the river. 

== History ==
A bridge has stood here since 1792 when it replaced a ferry. The structure was renewed in 1852–3, 1902 and most recently in 2014. The original charges ranged from a halfpenny ( of a pound) per pedestrian, sheep, lamb, boar, sow or pig to twopence for each wheel of a vehicle and twopence for the drawing animal (though one and a half if an ass), so a of a pound for a horse-drawn four-wheeled vehicle (). Horses and persons using the lock for barge hauling were exempt.


The Company of Proprietors of Whitchurch Bridge was promoted by a consortium of ten subscribers, and was authorised by the Whitchurch Bridge Act 1792 (32 Geo. 3. c. 97). Under this act, and the Whitchurch Bridge Act 1988, it has a duty to maintain the bridge &quot;forever in good and sufficient repair&quot; and to replace it if it becomes unsafe. In November 2008 the owners&#x27; predicted a renewal was vital within a decade and so announced application to the Department for Transport to double the toll for cars to 40p. This met with more local opposition than registered support. A public inquiry was held in June 2009 and the toll increase was approved in October 2009; the new toll came into force on 26 October 2009.

From October 2013 a complete reconstruction took place, with new and stronger piling and steel spans. The white lattice iron girders of the 1902 structure were refurbished and incorporated in the design. The contractor was Balfour Beatty, the designer Atkins and the project manager Oxfordshire County Council. During reconstruction the bridge was closed to vehicles, but a temporary footbridge was provided. The project was delayed for several months by exceptional flood flows in the Thames and the new bridge was finally opened on 19 September 2014. A blessing ceremony was conducted five days later by the Bishop of Oxford, during which a 1902 De Dion-Bouton was driven across the bridge, carrying Bridge Company directors and a descendant of one of the original bridge promoters of 1792.

As a result of the delays and consequent overspend on the reconstruction, the company proposed a further toll increase and a public enquiry was held on 19 May 2015. It considered 293 written objections but approved the request to increase tolls to 60p for cars and £4 for vehicles weighing more than 3.5 tonnes, on 12 August. In 2019 it was announced that the Company of Proprietors of Whitchurch Bridge had been sold to the General Estates Company, who previously held a minority stake in the company since the late 1920s.

<doc id="1238792" wikidata="Q7937430" url="?curid=1238792" title="Viva! Bravo!">
<text>Viva! Bravo! (1986) is the twentieth studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo and the first to be recorded in Italian. Released in 1986 by Globo Records, it reflects the band&#x27;s ongoing strategy of linguistic adaptation to reach audiences in different countries. 

The lineup during this period included Charlie Massó, Robby Rosa, Ricky Martin, Raymond Acevedo, and the new member Sergio Gonzalez, who replaced Roy Rosselló. The tracklist features versions of songs originally recorded in Spanish and English from five previous albums: &quot;Por Amor&quot; (1982), &quot;A Todo Rock&quot; (1983), &quot;Evolución&quot; (1984), &quot;Menudo&quot; (1985), and &quot;Ayer y Hoy&quot; (1985).

==Background==
In 1983, the group Menudo signed a six-year contract with RCA Records for the release of twelve albums, a deal worth several million dollars. Following the success of their first albums recorded in English and Portuguese, respectively titled &quot;Reaching Out&quot; (1984) and &quot;Mania&quot; (1984), the record label aimed to continue expanding its business beyond its southern border, including European countries such as Spain and Italy.

==Production and recording== 
On January 7, 1985, the newspaper &quot;La Opinión&quot; reported that the group planned to enter the studio and record songs in Italian during the first half of that year. The recordings took place at Estudios Kirios, owned by Discos CBS, in Madrid, Spain, and at the American Recording Co. studio in Hollywood, United States. The audio mixing was completed at Estudios Eurosonic, in Madrid. The album was produced by Edgardo Díaz, the group&#x27;s creator and manager, with assistance from Mary Lynne Pagán and Olimpio Petrossi. The graphic design (cover and back cover) was managed by Antonio Dojmi. 

The album’s title comes from the first track on Side A, &quot;Viva! Bravo!&quot;, which shares its name with the versions in Spanish and Portuguese included in the albums &quot;Ayer y Hoy&quot; and &quot;A Festa Vai Começar&quot;, both released in 1986. These versions achieved success on radio, ranking among the top positions on the record charts in Latin countries such as Bolivia (La Paz) and Brazil (Rio de Janeiro).

==Repertoire== 
The tracklist includes versions of songs originally recorded in Spanish and English from previous albums. From the album &quot;Ayer y Hoy&quot; (1986), the tracks &quot;Viva! Bravo!&quot; (&quot;Viva! Bravo!&quot;), &quot;Guardando Il Cielo Ed Un Gabbiano&quot; (&quot;Pañuelo Blanco Americano&quot;), and &quot;Vicino A Te&quot; (&quot;Acércate&quot;) were adapted. From &quot;Evolución&quot; (1984), the songs &quot;Baci Al Cioccolato&quot; (&quot;Sabes a Chocolate&quot;), &quot;Il Primo Amore&quot; (&quot;Amor Primero&quot;), and &quot;Acqua Candida&quot; (&quot;Agua de Limón&quot;) were included. The album &quot;A Todo Rock&quot; (1983) contributed &quot;Tu Come Stai (Senza Me)&quot; (&quot;Si tú no estás&quot;), &quot;Vivi La Vita&quot; (&quot;No te reprimas&quot;), and &quot;La Più Carina&quot; (&quot;Piel de manzana&quot;). &quot;Dolci Baci&quot; is a version of &quot;Dulces besos&quot; from the album &quot;Por Amor&quot; (1982). Finally, from the album &quot;Menudo&quot; (1985), the tracks &quot;Al Di Là Che Cosa C&#x27;è&quot; (&quot;You And Me All The Way&quot;) and &quot;Sogni&quot; (&quot;Hold Me&quot;) were translated.

==Promotion==
As part of their promotional efforts, the group traveled to Italy on February 12, 1986, to perform at the thirty-sixth edition of the Sanremo Music Festival (&quot;36º Festival della canzone italiana&quot;), where they performed the songs &quot;Baci al cioccolato&quot; and &quot;Viva! Bravo!&quot;. The RCA label included &quot;Baci al cioccolato&quot; in the compilation album &quot;Speciale Sanremo &#x27;86&quot;, which reached the sixth position on the Italian music chart. 

During this time, an incident was reported by Ramón L. Acevedo in his biography, &quot;“¡Papi, Quiero Ser Un Menudo!”&quot;. The author revealed internal tensions in Menudo following accusations of sexual abuse against Edgardo Díaz, the group&#x27;s manager, made by Ricky Martin and another member. After inappropriate physical contact with the boys, Ricky fled in tears and sought help from Robby and Charlie, who confronted Edgardo, threatening and condemning his behavior. The disclosure led parents to question their children&#x27;s contracts, while Edgardo attempted to manipulate members and isolate leaders like Robby. Further allegations of financial manipulation and harassment attempts escalated the conflict. Despite initial parental support, Edgardo retaliated by firing allies such as Edwin Fonseca, remaining relentless in his retribution against those who challenged his authority.

<text>Refrescante..., titled Menudo in the Brazilian edition, is a studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1986 by RCA Records. It is the group&#x27;s seventeenth album in Spanish and their third in Portuguese. The lineup at the time included members Ricky Martin, Robby Rosa, Charlie Massó, Raymond Acevedo, and Sérgio González. 

The album was produced by the trio Edgardo Díaz, Carlos Vilela, and Alejandro Monroy (the latter two being the principal composers of the work). The tracklist includes songs in the ballad and pop styles.

Regarding the Brazilian edition, it marked the first time the group recorded songs written by Brazilian composers: the single &quot;Diga Sim,&quot; for example, was written by Ed Wilson and Carlos Colla; the song &quot;Alegria&quot; was composed by Michael Sullivan and Paulo Massadas; and &quot;Cara ou Coroa&quot; is a version adapted by Carlos Costa.

==Singles==
&quot;Bésame&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single. Among the singles, it achieved the best commercial performance on the music chart published by &quot;Billboard,&quot; reaching number 21 on the Hot Latin Songs chart, the group&#x27;s highest position on that chart with a single.

Other singles from the Spanish edition include &quot;Hoy Me Voy Para México,&quot; &quot;A Cara, O Cruz,&quot; &quot;Salta La Valla,&quot; &quot;Amiga Mia,&quot; and &quot;La Primera Vez.&quot; &quot;Hoy Me Voy Para México&quot; was re-recorded in English as &quot;I&#x27;m Going Back to the Philippines&quot; and included in the group&#x27;s fourth English album, &quot;In Action,&quot; released in 1987.

The singles from &quot;Menudo&quot; (the Portuguese edition) were &quot;Cara ou Coroa&quot; and &quot;Diga Sim,&quot; with the latter reaching the top 10 on 105 FM radio. The track &quot;Hoje a Noite Não Tem Luar&quot; was later recorded by the Brazilian group Legião Urbana for their album &quot;Acústico MTV.&quot; According to one of the group&#x27;s members, Dado Villa-Lobos, the lead singer Renato Russo was a Menudo fan and followed the group&#x27;s tour in Rio.

==Critical reception==

Regarding the reviews from music critics, the critic from the site AllMusic rated the album two stars out of five, although no written commentary accompanied the rating.

Edgar Augusto, writing for &quot;Diário do Pará&quot; in his review of the Portuguese-language version of the album, stated that the album differs from the group’s previous works only in its language. According to the journalist, the &quot;Electronic drums, synthesizers patched with violins, dull melodies, and pseudo-youthful lyrics&quot; present in previous albums are also featured in &quot;Menudo&quot;. He concluded his review by writing: &quot;For the Menudos, just another album. For us, a piece of nonsense.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The Spanish version of the album reached the number 16 spot on the music chart Latin Pop Albums by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

<doc id="1238797" wikidata="Q5163644" url="?curid=1238797" title="Constant angular velocity">
<text>In optical storage, constant angular velocity (CAV) is a qualifier for the rated speed of any disc containing information, and may also be applied to the writing speed of recordable discs. A drive or disc operating in CAV mode maintains a constant angular velocity, contrasted with a constant linear velocity (CLV).

A typical CD-ROM drive operates in CLV mode, in contrast to a floppy or hard disk drive, or gramophone, which operates in CAV mode. In CAV mode, the spindle motor turns at a constant speed, which makes the medium pass by the read/write head faster when the head is positioned at the outside of the disk. In contrast, in CLV mode, the spindle motor speed varies so that the medium passes by the head at the same speed regardless of where on the disk the head is positioned. 

If the disk is recorded at the same areal density throughout, then when read or written in CAV mode, the data rate is higher for the outer tracks than for the inner tracks, whereas in CLV mode, the data rate is the same everywhere.

An advantage of CAV mode over CLV is that the drive mechanism is easier to engineer (and less expensive to build). Another advantage is that a device can switch from reading one part of a disk to reading another part more quickly, because in CLV mode, when the device moves the head in or out, it must change the speed of the disc.

== Dimensions ==

In case of a 12 cm standard diameter disc, data at the outermost edge (6 cm from center) is accessed at 2.4 times the speed of data at the inner edge of the data-containing program area (2.5 cm from center).

For a miniature disc with a diameter of 8 cm (radius of 4 cm), the speed ratio of outer to inner data edge is 1.6.

This means that, for example, if a disc is accessed at a constant angular velocity of ×24, the equivalent linear velocity is ×24 while accessed at the outermost edge of the data area while being ×10 at the innermost data area.

==Uses==

Gramophone records have always used CAV, including CEDs which provide video signals.

Some high-speed CD and DVD drives can use CAV. It allows for shorter access times because the rotation speed (angular velocity) does not need to be changed when the laser seeks across the disc, similarly to the magnetic head of a hard disk drive. With a given angular (rotation) speed, the linear speed at the outermost track is nearly 2.4 times as fast as that of the innermost track.

CAV was used in the LaserDisc format for interactive titles; it was also used with special editions of certain films. CAV allowed for perfect still frames, as well as random access to any given frame on a disc. Playing time, however, was 30 minutes on each side (these discs are also known as &quot;standard play&quot;), as opposed to 60 minutes on each side for CLV-based discs (&quot;extended play&quot;).

CAV is used with the Nintendo GameCube Game disc and Wii Optical disc, the original Xbox discs, and Sega&#x27;s GD-ROM.

=== Partial constant angular velocity (P-CAV) ===
If the used media (e.g. DVD-RAM variants) has a linear (writing) speed limitation that can not be attained with physically supported angular (rotation) speeds at the inner edge of the recordable area, the disc writing can start off with a constant angular velocity, until the increasing linear velocity has reached the writing speed limitation of the disc.

At that point, the drive transitions into writing with a constant linear velocity.

<doc id="1238799" wikidata="Q5028876" url="?curid=1238799" title="Can't Get Enough (Menudo album)">
<text>Can&#x27;t Get Enough is the twenty-third studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo and their third release in English, launched by RCA Victor in 1986. The group’s lineup for this album included Charlie Massó, Robi Rosa, Ricky Martin, Raymond Acevedo, and Sergio Gonzalez. 

The album consists of nine tracks: five original songs and four English cover versions of tracks from the 1986 album &quot;Refrescante...&quot;. The tracks alternate between romantic ballads and danceable rock. 

==Promotion==
As part of its promotion, Padosa Records produced a TV special directed and produced by Edgardo Díaz. Titled &quot;Puerto Rico... La Tierra de Menudo,&quot; the special featured commentary from the members and music videos for seven of the nine album tracks, as well as three songs from previous albums. The videos were filmed at various locations in Puerto Rico, including &quot;Marie (I Need You),&quot; &quot;Tell Me How You Feel,&quot; &quot;No One Can Love You More,&quot; &quot;Dolci Bacci,&quot; &quot;Alegria,&quot; &quot;Volta Para Mim,&quot; &quot;I Can&#x27;t Spend Another Day,&quot; &quot;Old Enough to Love,&quot; &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Over,&quot; and &quot;Summer in the Streets.&quot; 

The group promoted the album in Brazil. On May 1, 1987, they appeared on the &quot;Show Maravilha&quot; program, hosted by Mara Maravilha on the SBT, performing the songs &quot;Maria (I Need You)&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Spend Another Day&quot; alongside their new member, Ralphy Rodríguez. 

In Philippines, the group performed on the &quot;GMA Supershow,&quot; where they sang &quot;Summer in the Streets&quot; and received a gold record for the album &quot;The Best of Menudo&quot; (1986) from a representative of OctoArts International. 

In 1987, the group launched the &quot;Summer in the Streets Tour&quot; (named after the album’s lead track), which included 34 shows across various cities in the United States. The tour concluded in August of the same year. The tour also marked the group’s tenth anniversary and the addition of Ralphy Rodríguez, who replaced Charlie Massó.

==Critical reception==

Regarding music criticism, the critic from the AllMusic website rated the album three out of five stars but did not provide any written comments on it. 

Julio Brasilia, from the newspaper &quot;Diário do Pará&quot;, wrote a review stating that the album&#x27;s tracks alternate between &quot;romantic ballads and super danceable rock songs.&quot; According to him, the album&#x27;s standout track is &quot;No One Can Love You More,&quot; which was receiving high airplay on radio stations.

==Commercial performance==
The song &quot;No One Can Love You More&quot; appeared on charts in Brazil, according to reports published in the newspapers &quot;La Opinión&quot; and &quot;Jornal do Brasil.&quot;

<doc id="1238801" wikidata="Q664860" url="?curid=1238801" title="Ceremonial oath of the Bundeswehr">
<text>There were originally two types of soldiers serving in the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; (Federal Defence): regular units and conscripts. Consequently, there were also two types of oaths. Conscripts recited a pledge, since their service was compulsory and not unconditionally voluntary. Regular soldiers recited an oath in its true sense.

==Conscripted personnel==

Conscript&#x27;s pledge:

:&quot;Ich gelobe, der Bundesrepublik Deutschland treu zu dienen, und das Recht und die Freiheit des deutschen Volkes tapfer zu verteidigen.&quot;
Translation:

:&quot;I pledge to loyally serve the Federal Republic of Germany and to courageously defend the right and the liberty of the German people.&quot;

Conscripts are allowed to decline taking the pledge, but this forfeits any chance of promotion during service. This refusal does not constitute conscientious objection to military service, since German conscripts are also allowed to render alternative social service in its place.

==Professional soldiers and Soldiers for a Time==
Oath for other enlisted personnel, non-commissioned officers and officers serving for at least two years (Soldiers For a Time) or for lifetime (professional soldiers):

:&quot;Ich schwöre, der Bundesrepublik Deutschland treu zu dienen, und das Recht und die Freiheit des deutschen Volkes tapfer zu verteidigen, so wahr mir Gott helfe.&quot;

Translation:

:&quot;I swear to loyally serve the Federal Republic of Germany and to courageously defend the right and the liberty of the German people, so help me God.&quot;

The religious adjunct used with the oath was optional, the replacing of &quot;&quot;ich gelobe&quot; (I pledge) with &quot;ich schwöre&quot;&quot; (I swear) was not.

<doc id="1238803" wikidata="Q6132023" url="?curid=1238803" title="Somos Los Hijos del Rock">
<text>Somos Los Hijos Del Rock is the twenty-fourth studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1987 by the Melody label. The group’s lineup included members: Ricky Martin, Raymond Acevedo, Sergio Blass, and new members Ralphy Rodríguez and Rubén Gómez. Ralphy replaced Charlie Massó and Ruben Gómez replaced Robby Rosa.

The album was produced with the intention of renewing Menudo both visually and musically, and produced the successful single &quot;Y Te Veré - A Las Tres,&quot; which appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot Latin Songs chart.

In 1987, an album titled &quot;In Action&quot; was released in the Philippines, featuring versions in English and Tagalog of various Menudo songs, including three tracks from &quot;Somos Los Hijos Del Rock&quot;: &quot;Estamos En Acción&quot; (&quot;Action&quot;), &quot;Mi Sombra En La Pared - Bailo Con Mi Sombra&quot; (&quot;My Shadow On The Wall&quot;), and &quot;Dame Más&quot; (&quot;Gimme More&quot;). In the same year, an album aimed at the U.S. market was released, titled &quot;Sons of Rock&quot;, featuring new songs, though it carried a similar name to the Spanish-language album.

==New members==
In 1986, the company Padosa América, which managed the band&#x27;s career, announced a new member: Ralphy Rodríguez, a bilingual New Yorker, chosen from hundreds of candidates through a series of auditions. He would replace Charlie Rivera starting in January 1987.

In 1987, another new member, Rubén Gómez, was announced. He was 12 years old at the time and would replace Charlie Massó, who had completed five years (the limit for staying in the group) as a member of Menudo.

==Production==
The group had been experiencing a decline in album sales, and the artists had to switch labels. In an effort to renew the audience, the producers decided that the artists would have to completely change their appearance, as well as the sound of their music. The once dance-pop music and colorful style were replaced by a more rock-inspired style of singing and dressing.

The tracklist includes four cover versions by the rock band Miguel Mateos - Zas, taken from their 1986 album &quot;Solos En América&quot;*. According to the producer of Zas, Oscar López: “The conversations had been going on for some years with the Menudo team to record Miguel’s songs. Far from any prejudice, I thought it was a great promotion for a teen group with so much success to record Zas songs, considering the projection I had in mind [to expand Zas’ career] abroad.”

==Singles==
The singles chosen for release were &quot;Mi Sombra En La Pared (Bailo Con Mi Sombra)&quot;, &quot;Dame Más&quot;, and &quot;Estamos En Acción&quot;. The single &quot;Y Te Veré - A Las Tres&quot; became the most successful on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs chart, reaching number 45 and remaining on the chart for five consecutive weeks.

==Commercial performance==
According to a report from &quot;Billboard&quot;, although the group’s album sales had declined over time, record distributors in Puerto Rico reported that orders for the album &quot;Somos Los Hijos Del Rock&quot; were growing as quickly as when the band first began its career.

<text>In Action! is the twenty-fifth studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1987 by RCA Victor. The album is the second to feature the lineup of Ricky Martin, Raymond Acevedo, Sergio Blass, Ralphy Rodríguez, and Rubén Gómez, and the fourth to include songs in English. Additionally, it is the first album to feature tracks sung in Tagalog, the language spoken in the Philippines, reflecting RCA&#x27;s ongoing linguistic adaptation strategy to reach audiences in different countries.

The album&#x27;s tracklist includes nine songs, seven of which are in English and two in Tagalog. The Tagalog tracks were originally recorded in Spanish and Portuguese on previous albums, except for the new song &quot;That Situation.&quot;

Commercially, the album was a success, earning a gold record in the Philippines for its sales.

==Background==
In 1987, Menudo celebrated its tenth anniversary with a commemorative tour that sold out shows across Latin America and the United States. Ralphy Rodríguez replaced Charlie Massó, the last remaining original member of the group. However, despite his official departure, Massó continued performing with the quintet until their successful tour in the Philippines, during which his farewell was finalized.

By invitation of the daughter of the country&#x27;s president, Corazón Aquino, Menudo traveled to the Philippines, where they attracted 75,000 fans during a tour that included five shows at the Araneta Coliseum in Manila. The group&#x27;s achievements in the Philippines led Menudo to record their first album in Tagalog.

==Song selection==
From the album &quot;Por Amor&quot; (1982), a version of the song &quot;Lady&quot; was included. From &quot;Ayer y Hoy&quot; (1985), the track &quot;Acércate&quot; (&quot;Nang Dahil Sa &#x27;Yo&quot;) was selected. Representing the album &quot;Refrescante...&quot; (1986) is the song &quot;La primera vez&quot; (&quot;Se Bawa&#x27;t Halik&quot;), while the Brazilian version of the album, titled &quot;Menudo&quot;, features the track &quot;Come Back to Me,&quot; a version of &quot;Diga Sim.&quot; From &quot;Somos Los Hijos del Rock&quot; (1987), the tracks &quot;Estamos en acción&quot; (&quot;Action&quot;), &quot;Nena&quot; (&quot;Nena&quot;), and &quot;Mi Sombra En La Pared&quot; (&quot;My Shadow On The Wall&quot;) were included.

The digital version of the album included the bonus track &quot;I&#x27;m Going Back to the Philippines,&quot; which was released as a single to promote the Philippines-exclusive compilation album &quot;The Best of Menudo&quot; (1986). This song is an English re-recording of the group’s earlier hit &quot;Hoy Me Voy Para México,&quot; from &quot;Refrescante...&quot; (1986). Fans of the group often compare it to the 1976 song &quot;Manila&quot; by the Filipino band The Hotdogs, as both songs express a love for the country and the narrator’s longing to return home.

==Singles==
The song &quot;That Situation&quot; is a danceable track in English, recorded in collaboration with Filipino singer Lea Salonga. The track was composed by Gary Valenciano, with lyrics by Valenciano and Mary Lynne Paggan, and arrangements by Pedro Gely. The lyrics encourage teenagers to carefully reflect on decisions about sex, avoiding rushing into &quot;that situation.&quot;

To promote the song, the artists performed it on the ABS-CBN show &quot;Kalatog Pinggan&quot;, where they sang &quot;That Situation&quot; and were interviewed by Pinky Marquez and Richard Gomez. The music video portrays two teenagers exchanging shy glances whenever they see each other at school. Salonga sings: &quot;Wait and see what our love can be if we’re ready to face life together.&quot; The video was further promoted with a hotline that received over 22,000 calls in its first 18 months. Around the same time, a duet between Salonga and Charlie Massó titled &quot;I Still Believe&quot; was recorded, exploring a similar thematic approach.

Initially promoted as commercial projects, the songs achieved significant success and impact, reaching the top positions on the country&#x27;s music charts. According to a survey conducted with young people in the metropolitan area of Manila, 51% of respondents stated that the songs influenced them to discuss sexual responsibility with friends or parents.

Other singles from the album include &quot;Nang Dahil Sa’yo&quot; and &quot;Salta La Valla.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The quintet embarked on a promotional tour for the album, visiting cities across the Philippines. During this period, the record label organized a press conference and awarded the group a gold disc for the album&#x27;s outstanding performance in the country.

<text>Sons of Rock is the twenty-sixth studio album (and fifth in English) by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1988 by Blue Dog Records. This album marks the first time the group released entirely original songs in English; previous English albums had only contained translated versions of songs from their Spanish albums.

It featured Ricky Martin, Raymond Acevedo, Sergio Gonzalez, Rubén Gómez and new member Angelo García. Angelo replaced Ralphy Rodríguez, after just one year of tenure, Rodríguez&#x27;s parents pulled him off the band citing cruel treatment by management. 

==Members and title==
During this period, the group consisted of the following members: Ricky Martin, Raymond Acevedo, Sergio Blass, Rubén Gómez, and the new member Angelo García. At the beginning of 1988, the group appeared on television shows and performed live as a quartet, as Ralphy Rodríguez left the group after reaching the age limit of 16. 

This is the first English album the band recorded of all new material, without any previous Spanish songs translated into English.

The album has a similar name to the 1987 album &quot;Somos Los Hijos del Rock&quot;, although the only connection between the two is the more rock-inspired visual and musical style. This release continued Menudo&#x27;s aesthetic and musical transformation, which began in 1987 after the underperformance of previous albums. During this time, the group also released an album in the Philippines titled &quot;In Action&quot;, featuring English and Tagalog versions of songs from &quot;Somos Los Hijos del Rock&quot; and other recordings.

In late 1988/early 1989, &quot;Sons Of Rock&quot; was re-released with a new album cover. This time it featured a neon magenta color, as well as a new picture of the group and current line-up: Ricky Martin, Sergio Blass, Rubén Gómez, Angelo García and new member Robert Avellanet replacing Raymond Acevedo.

==Single==
&quot;You Got Potential,&quot; the sixth track, was released as a single. It achieved radio success, and according to Ricky Martin, &quot;The success led us to a 40-show tour in the United States. It was an exciting phase because we managed to reinvent ourselves to reach our fans with a different type of music.&quot;

==Promotion==
The group embarked on a tour to promote the album, which included performances in Mexico, where they were welcomed by a substantial number of fans at the airport. The show’s &quot;set list&quot; included Menudo hits along with several songs from *Sons of Rock*. One of the performances was broadcast by the television channel KMEX-TV in October 1988. The recordings were made live at the American theme park Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm.

<text>Los Últimos Héroes is a studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1989 by the record label Melody. The album was produced and recorded in Caracas, Venezuela, by Willie Croes, who is a producer and husband of Brazilian singer Elisa Rego. The group&#x27;s lineup included Sergio Gonzalez, Rubén Gómez, Angelo García, Robert Avellanet, and the new member Rawy Torres, who replaced Ricky Martin.

==Promotion==
To promote the album, the group embarked on an extensive tour, performing 40 shows in the United States and various other countries in South America. In 1989, a concert held in Caracas was released on VHS. The recordings took place at El Poliedro De Caracas on October 28 and 29 (Saturday and Sunday), 1989.

The album&#x27;s title was revived years later when the group reunited for a series of concerts in Puerto Rico and other Latin America countries in 2002 and 2005. This was the last album to feature Angelo García, who left the group at age 13 and was replaced by César Abreu.

==Commercial performance==
The album achieved significant commercial success, selling 40,000 copies in the United States, and earning a platinum certification in Venezuela. The album&#x27;s success inspired a homonymous telenovela miniseries, featuring future member Jonathan Montenegro in the cast.

<text>I Zwicky 18 is a blue compact dwarf galaxy located about 59 million light years away in the constellation Ursa Major. The galaxy was first identified by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky in a 1930s photographic survey of galaxies.

==Age==
Studies at the Palomar Observatory some 40 years ago led astronomers to believe that the galaxy erupted with star formation billions of years after its galactic neighbours. Galaxies resembling I Zwicky 18&#x27;s youthful appearance are typically found only in the early universe. Early observations with the Hubble Space Telescope suggested an age of 500 million years old for I Zwicky 18.

Astronomers have hypothesised the existence of young dwarf galaxies in a cold dark matter-dominated Universe. Dwarfs as young as 500 million years would be, however, much fainter than I Zwicky 18. I Zwicky 18 is thus unlikely to have formed all its stars recently in a cold dark matter Universe.

Later observations with the Hubble Space Telescope found faint and old stars contained within the galaxy, suggesting its star formation started at least one billion years ago and possibly as much as ten billion years ago. The galaxy, therefore, may have formed at the same time as most other galaxies.

==Contents==

Spectroscopic observations with ground-based telescopes have shown that I Zwicky 18 is almost exclusively composed of hydrogen and helium, the main ingredients created in the Big Bang. The galaxy&#x27;s primordial makeup suggests that its rate of star formation has been much lower than that of other galaxies of similar age. The galaxy has been studied with most of NASA&#x27;s telescopes, including the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), and the James Webb Space Telescope. However, it remains a mystery why I Zwicky 18 formed so few stars in the past, and why it is forming so many new stars right now.

In 2015 a study found a very large region of ionised helium in this small galaxy, which tends to be more frequent in very distant galaxies with low presence of metals. The ionization of helium implies the presence of objects emitting a radiation intense enough to knock electrons off the helium atoms. Scientists therefore hypothesise that I Zwicky 18 must contain Population III stars, which are almost absent in all other galaxies in the local universe.

==Distance==
Astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland and the European Space Agency discerned the distance by observing Cepheid variable stars within I Zwicky 18. These massive flashing stars pulse in a regular rhythm. The timing of their pulsations is directly related to their brightness. The team determined the observed brightness of three Cepheids and compared it with the actual brightness predicted by theoretical models. These models were calculated specifically for I Zwicky 18&#x27;s deficiency in heavy elements, indicating the galaxy&#x27;s stars formed before these elements were abundant in the universe. The Cepheid distance also was validated through the observed brightness of the brightest red stars older than one billion years.

The Hubble data suggest that I Zwicky 18 is 59 million light-years from Earth. The galaxy&#x27;s larger-than-expected distance may explain why astronomers have had difficulty detecting older, fainter stars within the galaxy. The faint, old stars in I Zwicky 18 are almost at the limit of Hubble&#x27;s resolution and sensitivity.

==Classification==
I Zwicky 18 is classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy and also a blue compact galaxy and a starburst galaxy. I Zwicky 18 is much smaller than our Milky Way and a mere 3,000 light-years across. I Zwicky 18 may still be creating Population III stars—spectroscopy shows that its stars are composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, with heavier elements almost completely absent. The concentrated bluish-white knots embedded in the heart of the galaxy are two major starburst regions where stars are forming at a furious rate. The wispy blue filaments surrounding the central starburst regions are bubbles of gas that have been blown away by stellar winds and supernovae explosions from a previous generation of hot, young stars. This gas is now heated by intense ultraviolet radiation unleashed by a new generation of hot, young stars.

<doc id="1238831" wikidata="Q7044463" url="?curid=1238831" title="No Me Corten El Pelo">
<text>No Me Corten El Pelo is a studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1990. The lineup for the quintet included Sergio Gonzalez, Rubén Gómez, Robert Avellanet, Rawy Torres, and new member Adrián Olivares, after César Abreu left the group.

==Promotion==
Events surrounding the album&#x27;s release and promotion marked a significant crisis in Menudo&#x27;s history. In November 1990, Gonzalez and Gómez were detained at Miami Airport for marijuana possession and were expelled from the group a few days before the album&#x27;s release on December 1. Management quickly replaced both with Edward Aguilera and Jonathan Montenegro, forming a new lineup composed of Robert, Rawy, Adrian, Edward, and Jonathan.

Months later, on April 6, 1991, another crisis unfolded: Avellanet, Torres, Aguilera, and Montenegro announced their departure from the group due to physical, psychological, and emotional abuse. Although Edgardo Díaz, Menudo&#x27;s manager, denied the allegations, management decided to replace them with new members: Alexis Grullón, Abel Talamántez, Andy Blázquez, and Ashley Ruiz, in an attempt to stabilize the group.

==Critica reception==
Regarding reviews from music critics, AllMusic rated it three out of five stars, although no accompanying text was provided to justify the rating.

==Commercial performance==
Commercially, despite the incidents, the album was a success. According to &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine, the quintet recorded significant sales with the album, after periods of low sales in their discography. In the United States, it reached the 22nd position on the &quot;Billboard Latin Pop Albums&quot; chart. In Puerto Rico, it ranked 15th on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Latin LPs chart.

<text>Detrás de tu Mirada is a studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1991. The quintet included Abel Talamántez, Alexis Grullón, Andy Blázquez, and Ashley Ruiz.

The album was the first recording with the four new members, following the departure of Robert, Rawy, Edward, and Jonathan, who cited physical, psychological, and emotional abuse as their reasons for leaving. Although Edgardo Díaz, the group&#x27;s manager, denied these allegations, the management decided to replace the former members with the new ones in an effort to stabilize Menudo.

==Commercial performance==
According to &quot;La Opinion&quot; newspaper, the songs &quot;Bésame En La Playa&quot; and &quot;Me Sigue Pareciendo Frío&quot; reached top positions on Peruvian radio stations weeks before the group visited the country to promote their next album. In the United States, &quot;Bésame En La Playa&quot; reached number 26 on the Hot Latin Tracks chart by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

==Critical reception==
Regarding reviews from specialized music critics, AllMusic rated the album just one out of five stars but did not include any commentary.

<doc id="1238841" wikidata="Q4550856" url="?curid=1238841" title="15 Años (Menudo album)">
<text>15 Años is a studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1992. At the time, the group consisted of Adrián Olivares and new members: Abel Talamántez, Alexis Grullón, Andy Blázquez, and Ashley Ruiz. This would be the last album featuring Adrián, who was replaced by Ricky López in 1993.

==Background==
After the success of their previous album, &quot;Detras de tu Mirada&quot;, in countries like Peru, Menudo released two English singles titled &quot;Dancin&#x27;, Movin&#x27;, Shakin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan Girl&quot;, under the McGillis Records label. For this new project, the group re-recorded some songs from Menudo&#x27;s discography, originally performed by members from other line-ups, and also included new tracks. Although the album is titled &quot;Quince Años&quot; (15 Years), the group was already 17 years into their career.

About the new album, Alexis, one of the members, commented: &quot;Our new album is celebratory. It not only contains well-known songs from the group but also brings new material.&quot; Ashley added: &quot;People who listen to Quince Años will realize that Menudo is much more than a group of five teenagers who sing and dance and sell millions of albums worldwide (...) Menudo is good music, clean and appropriate for young people. It’s a group that only promotes positive things and is against injustice, drugs, and violence.&quot;

==Promotion and commercial performance==
To promote the new album, three singles were released: &quot;Buscame&quot;, &quot;Y Tú Que Ni Te Fijas&quot;, and &quot;Lo Que Juramos&quot;. Commercially, &quot;Buscame&quot; was the most successful, reaching the number-one spot on radio charts in Peru. As part of the promotion, Menudo embarked on a tour that included performances in the United States and Europe.

<doc id="1238845" wikidata="Q7919459" url="?curid=1238845" title="Vem Pra Mim">
<text>Vem Pra Mim is the fifth and final album in Portuguese by the group Menudo, released in 1993. This was the only album performed by the lineup composed of Abel Talamántez, Alexis Grullón, Andy Blázquez, Ashley Ruiz, and new member Ricky López. Ricky replaced Adrián Olivares, who decided to leave the group.

The album features 12 tracks, including Portuguese versions of songs originally recorded in Spanish by other Menudo lineups. The track &quot;Eu Só Queria&quot; includes a special guest appearance by Brazilian TV host Mylla Christie, known for hosting the TV show &quot;Clube da Criança&quot; on Rede Manchete. Her participation was recorded in October 1993. Additionally, two songs from the &quot;Sombras &amp; Figuras&quot; album, released in 1988, were adapted into Portuguese: &quot;Serenata Rock&#x27;N Roll&quot; (also featured on the &quot;Os Ultimos Herois&quot; album released in 1990) with new lyrics, and &quot;Gafas Oscuras.&quot;

==Promotion==
To promote the album, Menudo appeared on Brazilian TV shows such as the &quot;Programa Sula Miranda&quot; on Record. The track &quot;Juras De Amor&quot; was released as a single. In 1994, the group also toured Brazil, performing in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

==Critical reception==
In a report on the group and the album, Simone do Vale from the newspaper &quot;Folha de Boa Vista&quot; remarked that the album&#x27;s songs are &quot;syrupy and sentimental like those of the past.&quot; However, she emphasized that the new members&#x27; popularity compensated: &quot;the new Menudo members are cute, charming, and intelligent.”

<doc id="1238846" wikidata="Q4972765" url="?curid=1238846" title="Brock Yates">
<text>Brock Yates (October 21, 1933 – October 5, 2016) was a prominent American journalist, TV commentator, TV reporter, screenwriter, and author. He was the longtime executive editor at &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine—and contributed to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, &quot;Boating&quot;, &quot;Vintage Motorsports&quot;, as well as other publications. 

With a journalism career spanning six decades, his work was highlighted by often irreverent and incisive industry critiques—including a 1968 analysis in Car and Driver titled &quot;The Gross Pointe Myopians,&quot; on which he expanded for his 1983 book, &quot;The Decline and Fall of the American Automotive Industry.&quot;
Yates was widely known for co-conceiving and then executing the first non-stop, cross-country Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, widely known as &quot;The Cannonball Run,&quot; in 1971—which subsequently gave rise to his screenwriting career. He co-wrote the 1980 film, &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II.&quot; For his reporting and racing participation, he was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America, in 2017. 

Writing for &quot;Motor Trend&quot;, noted automotive writer Steven Cole Smith, said Yates was a &quot;prolific, iconic, profane, brilliant, pioneering writer&quot; and &quot;called him the first superstar automotive writer.&quot;

==Background==
Yates was the son of American author Raymond Francis Yates and the former Marguerite Wendel. He was born and raised in Lockport, New York and graduated from Lockport High School in 1951. Yates&#x27; first articles appeared in &quot;Science and Mechanics&quot; magazine when he was 16 years old. He graduated from Hobart College and spent time in the United States Navy. 

His 1955 marriage to Sally Kingsley ended in divorce. In the late 1970s, he married Pamela Reynolds. Yates lived variously in Western New York state, in Castile, the village of Wyoming, and Fairport. 

First suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2007, Yates died at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Batavia, New York, on October 5, 2016, from complications of the disease, sixteen days shy of his 83rd birthday. He was survived by his wife, Pamela, sons Brock, Jr., and Daniel, a daughter, Claire Lilly, stepdaughter, Stacy Bradley and three grandchildren.

==Career==
Yates was hired in 1964 as managing editor at &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine by the magazine&#x27;s iconic editor, David E. Davis—who was noted for fostering an &quot;atmosphere of creative turbulence.&quot; Yates later recalled, &quot;little did [Davis] know that in fact I knew nothing about managing or editing.&quot; Four decades later (2006), he was fired by editor-in-chief Csaba Csere (as Yates himself noted) for being &quot;too expensive.&quot; 

On David E. Davis, Yates wrote:

::&quot;I hold the distinct honor of being the person David fired most in his long and storied career,&quot; Yates said. &quot;We were tough, opinionated sons of bitches who often went head to head, but at our core we loved and respected each other.&quot; Although they always settled their spats, Yates would add fuel to the fire whenever possible. In 1994, he wrote: &quot;Dave remains the grand old water buffalo of automotive journalism. To know him is to acknowledge his short fuse and penchant for unpredictable, snorting charges at friendly targets.&quot; Yates once called C/D’s then executive editor to report: &quot;Dave’s on the hill behind my house, crawling on his stomach. He’s got a shotgun.&quot;

As a best-selling author, most frequently about automotive topics and motor sport, some of Yates&#x27; articles and commentaries for &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine and other publications have had considerable impact within the auto industry and general public. Beginning with his 1968 critique of the American auto industry, its management, and its products: &quot;The Grosse Pointe Myopians,&quot; Yates established a recurring theme in his nonfiction work that American automotive management had grown arrogant, lost touch with its markets, and failed to respond to changing public needs/tastes, technology, and energy/environmental concerns. He developed the thesis in his 1983 book, &quot;The Decline and Fall of the American Automotive Industry&quot;—and followed up with his 1996 book &quot;The Critical Path:Inventing an Automobile and Reinventing a Corporation,&quot; a focused look at Chrysler&#x27; efforts to recast itself with development of its third generation minivans.

As a pit reporter for CBS, Yates covered certain NASCAR Cup Series (at the time, the Winston Cup) series races in the 1980s, including the Daytona 500. He was also one of the main commentators on the TNN motor sports TV show &quot;American Sports Cavalcade&quot; with Steve Evans where, on occasion, Paul Page, Gary Gerould, and Ralph Sheheen appeared. He was a commentator on racing and vintage cars at various points between 1995 and 2013 for the Speed Channel, a U.S. cable affiliate of Fox Sports. 

Yates wrote for &quot;The Truth About Cars&quot; briefly in January and February 2008.

Yates was inspired by Erwin G. &quot;Cannonball&quot; Baker (1882–1960), who set several coast-to-coast records, to initiate the Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash. 

Conceived by Yates and fellow &quot;Car and Driver&quot; editor Steve Smith, the first run was intended both as a celebration of the United States Interstate Highway System and as a protest against strict traffic laws coming into effect at the time. Another motivation was the fun involved, which showed in the tongue-in-cheek reports in &quot;Car and Driver&quot; and other auto publications worldwide. The initial cross-country run was made by Yates; his son, Brock Yates Jr.; Steve Smith; and friend Jim Williams beginning on May 3, 1971, in a 1971 Dodge Custom Sportsman van called the &quot;Moon Trash II.&quot;

The first competitive race was won by Brock and Formula One and Le Mans winner Dan Gurney in a Sunoco blue Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. The duo traveled from New York to Los Angeles in a then-record time of 35 hours, 54 minutes. In all, five Cannonballs were run between 1971 and 1979, although Yates never again won. The event was the inspiration for the 1976 movies &quot;Cannonball!&quot; and &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot;.

The event has continued on in the form of the Tire Rack One Lap of America Presented by Grassroots Motorsport Magazine. The event is now run by his son Brock Yates Jr. 2018 saw the 35th anniversary of the event.

==Screenwriting==
Yates along with director and stuntman Hal Needham, wrote &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot; (1980). Yates also wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981) film with the intention of giving the lead role to Steve McQueen. However, McQueen was diagnosed with cancer early in 1980 and was unable to do the film, leading to the casting of Burt Reynolds. Yates had a brief cameo in &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; as the race organizer who lays out the ground rules before the beginning of the race.

While Yates was not involved in them, &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; was followed by one sequel using his characters, &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), and a second sequel, &quot;Speed Zone&quot; (1989), which, apart from being about the race and a small cameo by Jamie Farr&#x27;s character, had no other connections.

<text>Imagínate... is a studio album by the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, released in 1994. The album featured the members Abel Talamántez, Alexis Grullón, Andy Blázquez, Ashley Ruiz and Ricky López, and is the second album recorded by this line-up.

==Songs and promotion==
While promoting the album in Peru, the song &quot;Los Amigos y Las Amigas&quot; was accused of plagiarism of the song &quot;Los Patos y Las Patas&quot; by singer Raúl Romero, a member of the group Los Nosequién y Los Nosecuántos. Edgardo Díaz, Menudo&#x27;s manager, denied the accusations, stating that the term &quot;plagiarism&quot; was being misused, as the word &quot;patas&quot; was simply replaced with a synonym due to the pejorative use of the word &quot;pato&quot; in Puerto Rico.

The Peruvian authorities banned the distribution and commercialization of the song. This decision was made after a resolution by INDECOPI, which pointed out similarities in the title and content of the songs. The record label Discos Hispánicos in Peru was also prevented from distributing the song. Díaz claimed the controversy was an attempt at self-promotion by the singer. Romero allegedly demanded $20,000 to lift the ban on the song, but the request was denied. 

The song &quot;Mil Ángeles&quot; was composed as a tribute to the young Peruvian Cecilia Huamán, who died in 1993 during a concert by the band. The music, written by Rawy Torres and Edgardo Díaz, reflects the impact of this loss not only on the fans but also on the group members, who visited Cecilia&#x27;s family and grave as a gesture of condolences. Inspired by a letter and the emotions the teenager carried with her to the concert, the lyrics express the eternity of pure love and the hope of reunion, also symbolizing the emotional connection between artists and their admirers.

==Commercial performance==
The album resulted in a success for the group on the radio, with the song &quot;Yo Quiero Bailar Reggae&quot; reaching the number one spot on the music chart in Panama.

<doc id="1238851" wikidata="Q919132" url="?curid=1238851" title="Paul Gonsalves">
<text>Paul Gonsalves ( – ) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist best known for his association with Duke Ellington. At the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival, Gonsalves played a 27-chorus solo in the middle of Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue,&quot; a performance credited with revitalizing Ellington&#x27;s waning career in the 1950s.

==Biography==
Born in Brockton, Massachusetts, to Portuguese Cape Verdean parents, Gonsalves&#x27; first instrument was the guitar, and as a child he was regularly asked to play Cape Verdean folk songs for his family. He grew up in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and played as a member of the Sabby Lewis Orchestra. His first professional engagement in Boston was with the same group on tenor saxophone, in which he played before and after his military service during World War II. He also played with fellow Cape Verdean Americans in Phil Edmund&#x27;s band in the 1940s. Before joining Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra in 1950, he also played in big bands led by Count Basie (1947–1949) and Dizzy Gillespie (1949–1950).

At the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival, Gonsalves&#x27; solo in Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue&quot; went through 27 choruses; the publicity from this performance is credited with reviving Ellington&#x27;s career. The performance is captured on the album &quot;Ellington at Newport&quot;. Gonsalves was a featured soloist in numerous Ellingtonian settings. He received the nickname &quot;The Strolling Violins&quot; from Ellington for playing solos while walking through the crowd.

Gonsalves died in London ten days before Duke Ellington&#x27;s death, after a lifetime of addiction to alcohol and narcotics. Mercer Ellington refused to tell Duke of the passing of Gonsalves, fearing the shock might further accelerate his father&#x27;s decline. Ellington and Gonsalves, along with trombonist Tyree Glenn, lay side by side in the same New York funeral home for a period of time.

Gonsalves is buried at the Long Island National Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York.

<text>The Niger national football team (French: &quot; Equipe de football du Niger&quot;) represents Niger in international football through the Nigerien Football Federation, a member of Confederation of African Football (CAF). Niger plays in the colors of the flag of Niger, white, green and orange. Their nickname comes from the Dama gazelle, native to Niger, the Hausa name of which is &quot;Meyna&quot; or &quot;Ménas&quot; The Dama appears on their badge in the colors of the national flag. 

==History==
Although one of the less successful sides in the strong West Africa region, Niger has produced a couple of noteworthy runs in qualifying tournaments.

One of their best performances was in the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in which Niger eliminated Somalia and Togo on the away goals rule, but were beaten by Algeria in the third round where only eight teams were left. Notable players in this run included Jacques Komlan, Hassane Adamou and Moussa Kanfideni.

In 1990, they set a record by thrashing Mauritania 7–1 in continental qualifiers, the highest positive score margin for the &quot;Mena&quot;.

In the 2004 African Nations Cup qualifiers, Niger won all their home games (including a win over Guinea) to finish on nine points, just three short of qualification.

The Niger squad is also plagued by financial concerns, which have caused them to withdraw from international tournaments on more than one occasion. The Nigerien Football Federation would have turned to fundraising to pay for their trip to the 2010 African Cup of Nations in Angola, had they qualified.

On 10 October 2010, Niger earned a shock 1–0 win over Egypt at home in the 2012 African Cup of Nations qualification.

Despite a failed run for AFCON 2010, Niger hosted and won the UEMOA Tournament in November 2010, and followed up with their first ever qualification for the African Nations Championship in February 2011.

After home wins over South Africa and Sierra Leone, on 8 October 2011 Niger qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in its history, despite losing 3–0 in Egypt. Niger, South Africa and Sierra Leone all ended with nine points, but Niger qualified thanks to their superior head-to-head record against their rivals.

At the 2012 African Cup of Nations, Niger was placed in Group C alongside co-hosts Gabon, Tunisia and Morocco. In their opening match, Niger lost 2–0 to Gabon, while against Tunisia in Libreville, Niger trailed 1–0 on an early goal from Youssef Msakni in which he dribbled his way through for a fine goal after just four minutes. William N&#x27;Gounou, however, then made history by scoring Niger&#x27;s first ever goal at the African Cup of Nations. A 1–1 draw looked likely, but Issam Jemâa&#x27;s goal would eliminate Niger from the tournament. In the final match, Niger faced Morocco in a match featuring two sides already eliminated from the tournament. Younès Belhanda scored on an assist from Marouane Chamakh just 11 minutes from time to give Morocco a 1–0 victory.

Later in 2012, Niger repeated its success in African Nations Cup qualifiers by beating Guinea in a two-legged series to qualify for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. Guinea won the first match 1–0, but Niger won 2–0 in the second leg. Goalscorers Mohamed Chikoto and Issoufou Boubacar had sent Niger to another African Cup of Nations tournament.

In their first match at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, Niger lost 1–0 to Mali at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. Mali captain Seydou Keita handed his nation the hard-fought victory five minutes before the end of the encounter. Niger then earned their first point ever at the African Cup of nations after holding DR Congo to a 0–0 draw. In the third match, Ghana outclassed Niger 3–0 to reach the quarter-finals as Group B winners. Niger finished bottom of the group.

On 22 May 2014, Niger played a friendly match against Ukraine, marking the first ever match against a European nation. Oumarou Bale scored in the 56th minute, cancelling out a 20th-minute goal from Ivan Ordets before Ukraine won on a goal from Taras Stepanenko as the match finished 2–1.

<doc id="1238868" wikidata="Q1349107" url="?curid=1238868" title="Geophagia">
<text>Geophagia (), also known as geophagy (), is the intentional practice of consuming earth or soil-like substances such as clay, chalk, or termite mounds. It is a behavioural adaptation that occurs in many non-human animals and has been documented in more than 100 primate species. Geophagy in non-human primates is primarily used for protection from parasites, to provide mineral supplements and to help metabolize toxic compounds from leaves. Geophagy also occurs in humans and is most commonly reported among children and pregnant women.

Human geophagia is a form of pica – the craving and purposive consumption of non-food items – and is classified as an eating disorder in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) if not socially or culturally appropriate. Sometimes geophagy is a consequence of carrying a hookworm infection. Although its etiology remains unknown, geophagy has many potential adaptive health benefits as well as negative consequences.

==Animals==
Geophagia is widespread in the animal kingdom. Galen, the Greek
philosopher and physician, was the first to record the use of clay by sick or injured animals in the second century AD. This type of geophagia has been documented in &quot;many species of mammals, birds, reptiles, butterflies and isopods, especially among herbivores&quot;.

===Birds===
Many species of South American parrots have been observed at clay licks, and sulphur-crested cockatoos have been observed ingesting clays in Papua New Guinea. Analysis of soils consumed by wild birds show that they often prefer soils with high clay content, usually with the smectite clay families being well represented.

The preference for certain types of clay or soil can lead to unusual feeding behaviour. For example, Peruvian Amazon rainforest parrots congregate not just at one particular bend of the Manu River but at one specific layer of soil which runs hundreds of metres horizontally along that bend. The parrots avoid eating the substrate in layers one metre above or below the preferred layer. These parrots regularly eat seeds and unripe fruits containing alkaloids and other toxins that render the seeds and fruits bitter and even lethal. Because many of these chemicals become positively charged in the acidic stomach, they bind to clay minerals which have negatively charged cation-exchange sites, and are thereby rendered safe. Their preferred soils have a much higher cation-exchange capacity than the adjacent, rejected layers of soils because they are rich in the minerals smectite, kaolin, and mica. The preferred soils surpass the pure mineral kaolinate and surpass or approach pure bentonite in their capacity to bind quinine and tannic acid.

&quot;In vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot; tests of these soils and many others from southeastern Peru indicate that they also release nutritionally important quantities of minerals such as calcium and sodium. In the Manu River example cited above, the preferred soil bands had much higher levels of sodium than those that were not chosen. Repeated studies have shown that the soils consumed most commonly by parrots in South America have higher sodium contents than those that are not consumed.

It is unclear which factor is driving avian geophagy. However, evidence is mounting that sodium is the most important driver among parrots in southeastern Peru. Parrots are known to eat toxic foods globally, but geophagy is concentrated in very specific regions. Researchers Lee etal. show that parrot geophagy in South America is positively correlated to a significant degree with distance from the ocean. This suggests that overall lack of sodium in the ecosystem, not variation in food toxicity, is a better predictor of the spatial distribution of geophagy. This work, coupled with the recent findings of consistently high sodium levels in consumed soils, make it highly likely that sodium is the primary driver of avian geophagy among parrots (and possibly other taxa) in the western Amazon Basin. This supplemental nutrients hypothesis is further supported by peak geophagy occurring during the parrots&#x27; breeding season.

===Non-human primates===
There are several hypotheses about the importance of geophagia in bats and primates. Chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, Uganda, have been observed to consume soil rich in kaolinite clay shortly before or after consuming plants including &quot;Trichilia rubescens&quot;, which possesses antimalarial properties in the laboratory.

Geophagy is a behavioural adaptation seen in 136 species of nonhuman primates from the suborder Haplorrhini (81%) and Strepsirrhini (19%). The most commonly ingested soils are soils from mounds, soils from tree bases, soils from termite mounds, &#x27;Pong&#x27; soils, and forest floor. Studies have shown many benefits of geophagy such as protection from parasites (4.9%), mineral supplements (19.5%), and helping to metabolize toxic compounds from leaves (12.2%) nonexclusive. From soil analysis, it has been seen that one of the main compounds in the earth consumed by these primates is clay minerals that contains kaolinite, which is commonly used in medications for diarrheal and intestinal problems. Geophagic behaviour plays an important role in nonhuman primates&#x27; health. This kind of zoopharmacognosy use differs from one species to another. For example, mountain gorillas from Rwanda tend to ingest clay soil during dry season, when the vegetation changes forcing them to feed on plants that have more toxic compounds, in this case the ingested clay absorbs these toxins providing digestive benefits. This kind of seasonal behavioural adaptation is also seen in the red-handed howler monkeys from the western Brazilian Amazonia, which also have to adapt to the shift of feeding on leaves that contains more toxic compounds. In other cases, geophagy is used by the Ring-Tailed Lemurs as a preventive and therapeutic behaviour for parasite control and intestinal infection. These benefits from clay ingestion can also be observed among rhesus macaques. In a study that was carried out in the island of Cayo Santiago, it has been observed that the rhesus macaques had intestinal parasites and their health was not affected and they did not have many gastrointestinal effects from these parasites. Data observed shows that this was caused by the consumption of clay soil by this species. On the other hand observations have shown that behavioural geophagy provides mineral supplements, as seen among Cambodia&#x27;s Colobinae. The study was done at the salt licks in Veun Sai-Siem Pang Conservation Area, a site that is visited by various species of nonhuman primates. More in-depth research needs to be carried out in order to better understand this behavioural adaptation of geophagy among nonhuman primates.

===Bats===
There is debate over whether geophagia in bats is primarily for nutritional supplementation or detoxification. It is known that some species of bats regularly visit mineral or salt licks to increase mineral consumption. However, Voigt etal. demonstrated that both mineral-deficient and healthy bats visit salt licks at the same rate. Therefore, mineral supplementation is unlikely to be the primary reason for geophagia in bats. Additionally, bat presence at salt licks increases during periods of high energy demand. Voigt etal. concluded that the primary purpose for bat presence at salt licks is for detoxification purposes, compensating for the increased consumption of toxic fruit and seeds.

==Humans==

===Anthropological and historical evidence===
Evidence for the likely origin of geophagy was found in the remains of early humans in Africa:

Geophagia is nearly universal around the world in tribal and traditional rural societies (although apparently it has not been documented in Japan or Korea). In the ancient world, several writers noted the phenomenon of geophagia. Pliny is said to have noted the ingestion of soil on Lemnos, an island of Greece, and the use of the soils from this island was noted until the 14th century. The textbook of Hippocrates (460–377 BCE) mentions geophagia, and the famous medical textbook titled &quot;De Medicina&quot; edited by A.Cornelius Celsus (14–37 CE) seems to link anaemia to geophagia. One of Rumi&#x27;s fables tells about a geophage being cheated by a sugar seller who leaves him alone with a weight made of clay and then waits until the man eats enough of it, thus reducing the amount of sugar he will get.

The existence of geophagy among Native Americans was noted by early explorers in the Americas, including Gabriel Soares de Sousa, who in 1587 reported a tribe in Brazil using it in suicide, and Alexander von Humboldt, who said that a tribe called the Otomacs ate large amounts of soil. In Africa, David Livingstone wrote about slaves eating soil in Zanzibar, and it is also thought that large numbers of slaves brought with them soil-eating practices when they were trafficked to the New World as part of the transatlantic slave trade. Slaves who practised geophagia were nicknamed &quot;clay-eaters&quot; because they were known to consume clay, as well as spices, ash, chalk, grass, plaster, paint, and starch.

===Contemporary practices===
In Africa, kaolinite, sometimes known as &quot;kalaba&quot; (in Gabon and Cameroon), &quot;calaba&quot;, and &quot;calabachop&quot; (in Equatorial Guinea), is eaten for pleasure or to suppress hunger. Kaolin for human consumption is sold at most markets in Cameroon and is often flavoured with spices such as black pepper and cardamom. Consumption is greatest among women, especially to cure nausea during pregnancy, in spite of the possible dangerous levels of arsenic and lead to the unborn child. Another example of geophagia was reported in Mangaung, Free State Province in South Africa, where the practice was geochemically investigated. Calabash chalk is also eaten in west Africa.

In Haiti, poor people are known to eat bonbon tè made from soil, salt, and vegetable shortening. These biscuits hold minimal nutritional value, but manage to keep the poor alive. However, long-term consumption of the biscuits is reported to cause stomach pains and malnutrition, and is not recommended by doctors.

In Central Java and East Java, Indonesia a food made of soil called ampo is eaten as a snack or light meal. It consists of pure clay, without any mixture of ingredients.

Bentonite clay is available worldwide as a digestive aid; kaolin is also widely used as a digestive aid and as the base for some medicines. Attapulgite, another type of clay, is an active ingredient in many anti-diarrheal medicines.

=== Impact on health ===
Clay minerals have been reported to have beneficial microbiological effects, such as protecting the stomach against toxins, parasites, and pathogens. Humans are not able to synthesize vitamin B12 (cobalamin), so geophagia may be a behavioral adaption to obtain it from bacteria in the soil. Mineral content in soils may vary by region, but many contain high levels of calcium, copper, magnesium, iron, and zinc, minerals that are critical for developing fetuses which can cause metallic, soil, or chewing ice cravings in pregnant women. To the extent that these cravings, and subsequent mineral consumption (as well as in the case of cravings for ice, or other cold neck vasoconstricting food which aid in increasing brain oxygen levels by restricting neck veins) are therapeutically effective decreasing infant mortality, those genetic predispositions and the associated environmental triggers, are likely to be found in the infant as well. Likewise, multigenerationally impoverished villages or other homogenous socioeconomic closed genetic communities are more likely to have rewarded gene expression of soil or clay consumption cravings, by increasing the likelihood of survival through multiple pregnancies for both sexes.

There are obvious health risks in the consumption of soil that is contaminated by animal or human feces; in particular, helminth eggs, such as &quot;Ascaris&quot;, which can stay viable in the soil for years, can lead to helminth infections. Tetanus poses a further risk. Lead poisoning is also associated with soil ingestion, as well as health risks associated with zinc exposure can be problematic among people who eat soils on a regular basis. Gestational geophagia (geophagia in pregnancy) has been associated with various homeostatic disruptions and oxidative damage in rats.

<doc id="1238874" wikidata="Q3851789" url="?curid=1238874" title="Matewan">
<text>Matewan () is a 1987 American independent drama film written and directed by John Sayles, and starring Chris Cooper (in his film debut), James Earl Jones, Mary McDonnell and Will Oldham, with David Strathairn, Kevin Tighe and Gordon Clapp in supporting roles. The film dramatizes the events of the Battle of Matewan, a coal miners&#x27; strike in 1920 in Matewan, a small town in the hills of West Virginia.

&quot;Matewan&quot; was a critical success but a box office flop, grossing under $2 million on an estimated $4 million budget. The film received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and received a Criterion Collection re-release in 2019.

==Plot==
Joe Kenehan is an ex-Wobbly organizer for the United Mine Workers. He arrives in Matewan, West Virginia in 1920 to organize miners against the Stone Mountain Coal Company. His introduction to the town is his witnessing of a mob of miners angry at wage cuts beating up black miners who intended to cross the picket line. He takes up residence at a boarding house run by a coal miner&#x27;s widow, Elma Radnor, and her 15-year-old son, Danny, who is also a miner and a budding Baptist preacher. The miners are reluctant to bring the imported workers, both black and Italian, into their union, a cause not helped by C. E. Lively, a spy for the company within the union, who tries to goad the miners into violence and secretly informs the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency of the &quot;red&quot; Kenehan&#x27;s presence.

The next day, two Baldwin-Felts men, Hickey and Griggs, show up in town and take up residence at the Radnor boarding house. Danny at first refuses to give rooms to Hickey and Griggs, but Kenehan voluntarily moves to the hotel, freeing up a room for the two men and averting trouble for Mrs. Radnor. Hickey and Griggs then start their campaign against the union by forcibly evicting miners from company-owned houses in town. Mayor Testerman and Police Chief Sid Hatfield refuse to let them be evicted without eviction writs from Charleston. Hatfield deputizes all the men in town and tells them to go home and come back with their guns.

The Baldwin-Felts men then turn their attention on the strikers&#x27; camp outside town, where the miners and their families are living in tents. At night, the armed strikebreakers fire shots into the camp, injuring some strikers. The next day, they enter the camp to demand that all food and clothing purchased at the company store with scrip be turned over to them, but are thwarted by the arrival of armed hill people, whose land was taken by the coal company. Expressing disdain for the noise caused by the gunmen&#x27;s automobile the night before, their presence and sympathy for the miners compels the Baldwin-Felts men to leave empty-handed. The slow arrival of the union&#x27;s thinly stretched strike funds tests the patience of Danny Radnor and other miners who become disillusioned and turn to violence in spite of Kenehan&#x27;s warnings. The miners are involved in a night-time shootout with the agents and Sephus is wounded. He is rescued by some hill people but not before he recognizes Lively as the infiltrator.

Lively tries to drive a wedge between Kenehan and the miners by convincing a young widow, Bridey Mae Tolliver, to falsely accuse Kenehan of sexual assault, and he plants a letter that makes Kenehan appear to be the infiltrator, leading the miners to plot to kill Kenehan. Danny overhears Hickey and Griggs talking about the scheme and is discovered and threatened by Hickey. That night, while preaching at the Freewill church, Danny relates a parable about Joseph that convinces the miners they have been deceived by a false story, taking advantage of the now-inebriated detectives. Lively silently slips out of the back of the church while a miner runs to the camp to stop Few Clothes from killing Kenehan. Meanwhile, Sephus has made his way back to town and informed the others of Lively&#x27;s betrayal, furiously burning down his restaurant. Lively flees town by swimming across the Tug Fork River.

Later, while Danny and his friend Hillard Elkins are stealing coal from the mine, they are confronted by the detectives. Danny hides, while Elkins is tortured for information. He provides five names, and is killed by Griggs anyway. Lively reveals that the men he named died in a mine accident years before and muses that the death of a young boy will complicate things.

The situation between the Baldwin-Felts men and Chief Hatfield reaches a boiling point with the arrival of reinforcements with orders to carry out the evictions. The mayor tries to negotiate as Kenehan comes running to try to stop the fight. The sudden movement sets off a climactic gunfight between the exposed mercenaries and the armed townspeople firing from barricades and rooftops. Hatfield shoots two men and survives the battle, but Kenehan is killed and the mayor is shot in the stomach. Griggs is brought down, while Hickey escapes to Elma Radnor&#x27;s boarding house, where he is shot and killed by Elma Radnor. Seven Baldwin-Felts men and two townspeople are ultimately killed.

In the epilogue, the narrator (revealed to be an elderly Danny recalling those days in &quot;Bloody Mingo&quot;) recounts that Mayor Testerman succumbed to his wounds and the mayor&#x27;s wife married Chief Sid Hatfield. But Hatfield was later gunned down in broad daylight on the steps of the McDowell County Courthouse in Welch, with Lively stepping up to deliver the &quot;coup de grâce&quot;. He recalls the event as the start of the Great Coalfield War.

==Reception and legacy==
===Critical response===
&quot;Variety&quot; praised the acting in the film, writing, &quot;&quot;Matewan&quot; is a heartfelt, straight-ahead tale of labor organizing in the coal mines of West Virginia in 1920 that runs its course like a train coming down the track. Among the memorable characters is Joe Kenehan (Chris Cooper), a young union organizer who comes to Matewan to buck the bosses. With his strong face and Harrison Ford good-looks, Cooper gives the film its heartbeat...Most notable of the black workers is &#x27;Few Clothes&#x27; Johnson (James Earl Jones), a burly good-natured man with a powerful presence and a quick smile. Jones&#x27; performance practically glows in the dark. Also a standout is Sayles veteran David Strathairn as the sheriff with quiet integrity who puts his life on the line.&quot;

Film critic Vincent Canby lauded the acting and the cinematography in the film and wrote in his review, &quot;There&#x27;s not a weak performance in the film, but I especially admired the work of Mr. Cooper, Mr. Tighe, Miss McDonnell, Miss Mette, Mr. Gunton, Mr. Strathairn and Mr. Mostel. They may be playing Social-Realist icons, but each manages to make something personal and idiosyncratic out of the material, without destroying the ballad-like style. For the most part, Haskell Wexler&#x27;s photography doesn&#x27;t go overboard in finding poetry in the images.&quot;

Critic Desson Howe liked the look of the film and wrote, &quot;Cinematographer Haskell Wexler etches the characters in dark charcoal against a misty background. You get the feeling of dirt, sweat and – despite the story&#x27;s mythic intentions – the grim grey struggle of it all. And Sayles, struggling for authority from &quot;Return of the Secaucus 7&quot; through &quot;The Brother from Another Planet&quot;, has finally tapped the vein.&quot;

Jonathan Rosenbaum called Matewan a &quot;simpleminded yet stirring&quot; film which &quot;offers a bracing alternative to complacent right-wing as well as liberal claptrap. If Sayles’s bite were as lethal as his bark, he might have given this a harder edge and a stronger conclusion.&quot;

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 94% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 34 reviews.

=== Accolades ===
Cinematographer Haskell Wexler received an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography at the 60th Academy Awards.

In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked the film at number 21 on its list of the 50 Greatest American Independent Movies. Its description read, &quot;The film not only marked a significant turning point in Sayles’ career (it was his first film to attract anything like a mainstream audience), it&#x27;s arguably an even more relevant, cautionary tale today than it was during the Reagan/Thatcher controlled-climate of its release year.&quot;

In 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Locations==
The film was made in West Virginia with the town of Thurmond standing in for Matewan. Other scenes were filmed along the New River Gorge National River.

==Soundtrack==
The film score features Appalachian music of the period composed and performed by Mason Daring, who frequently works on John Sayles&#x27; films. West Virginia bluegrass singer Hazel Dickens sings the film&#x27;s title track, &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot;, and appears in the film as a member of the Freewill Baptist Church whose voice is heard leading the congregation in an a cappella hymn (&quot;What A Friend We Have in Jesus&quot;) and also sings over the grave of a fallen union miner, Hillard Elkins, (&quot;Gathering Storm&quot;). Dickens also sings &quot;Hills of Galilee&quot; over the closing credits.

The soundtrack was released on LP by Columbia.
Other performers are John Hammond, Phil Wiggins (harmonica); Gerry Milnes, Stuart Schulman (fiddle), Jim Costa (mandolin); John Curtis (guitar), and Mason Daring (guitar, dobro).

==In popular culture==
The version of Gathering Storm used in the film was sampled by Canadian post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor for their 1997 album F♯ A♯ ∞, with the band later reusing the melody for a track also named Gathering Storm in their 2000 album Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven.

<doc id="1238888" wikidata="Q3365458" url="?curid=1238888" title="Parker (Stark novels character)">
<text>Parker is a fictional character created by American novelist Donald E. Westlake. A professional robber specializing in large-scale, high-profit crimes, Parker is the main protagonist of 24 of the 28 novels Westlake wrote under the pseudonym Richard Stark.

==Writing style==
Westlake wrote under many pseudonyms as well as his own name, but the Richard Stark pseudonym was notable both for the sheer amount of writing credited to it (far more than any other except Westlake&#x27;s real name itself), as well as for Stark&#x27;s particular style of writing, which was colder, darker, less sentimental, and less overtly humorous than Westlake&#x27;s usual prose. For a period in the late 1960s, the Stark name was more well-known and more lucrative for Westlake than his real name. According to Westlake, he chose the name &quot;Richard Stark&quot; for actor Richard Widmark, whose performance in the film &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; impressed Westlake: &quot;part of the character&#x27;s fascination and danger is his unpredictability. He&#x27;s fast and mean, and that&#x27;s what I wanted the writing to be: crisp and lean, no fat, trimmed down ... &quot;stark&quot;.&quot; Westlake described the difference between Stark&#x27;s style and his usual style in a 2001 article for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;: &quot;Stark and Westlake use language very differently. To some extent they&#x27;re mirror images. Westlake is allusive, indirect, referential, a bit rococo. Stark strips his sentences down to the necessary information.&quot;

==Overview==
A ruthless career criminal, Parker has almost no traditional redeeming qualities, aside from efficiency and professionalism. Parker lives by one ethical principle: he will not double-cross another professional criminal with whom he is working, unless they try to double-cross &quot;him&quot;. Should that happen, Parker will unhesitatingly undertake to exact a thorough and brutal revenge. Parker is callous, meticulous, and perfectly willing to commit murder if he believes it necessary. However, Parker prefers to avoid murder less due to moral considerations and more because of practical factors: murder brings greater attention from the police and general public than does robbery or theft. 

Parker&#x27;s first name is never mentioned in the novels, and there are many details about him which remain unknown. In fact, it is hinted throughout the series that the name &quot;Parker&quot; might itself be an alias.

In a 1981 introduction to a reprint of &quot;The Mourner&quot; (1963), Westlake&#x27;s friend and fellow crime novelist Lawrence Block describes Parker as rare among anti-hero protagonists in that the character never develops a conscience. Block argues that novelists are generally &quot;uncomfortable writing consistently from an antisocial perspective&quot;, and tend to soften such characters, a fate Parker avoids: &quot;[Parker] never turns honest, or finds God, or starts working as a secret agent for the government.&quot; According to Block, a sign of Westlake&#x27;s genius and the key factor in the character&#x27;s durability, was the realization that &quot;[a] mellow Parker is no Parker at all.&quot; Albert Frederick Nussbaum, a bank robber turned writer, notes that given Parker&#x27;s &quot;cold, methodical [and] humorless&quot; habits, the character would be the villain in most books. But Nussbaum also identifies two critical elements that make Parker a sympathetic protagonist: he is surrounded by criminals even more ruthless than he and though Parker is capable of &quot;using&quot; violence he rarely if ever &quot;initiates&quot; violence except in self-defense.

== Character ==
While in 1966&#x27;s &quot;The Handle&quot;, Parker&#x27;s age is explicitly stated to be 38, Parker is, essentially, an ageless character—in the various Parker novels that were written and take place over a span of 45 years, Parker always appears to be somewhere around 40.

Physically, Parker is described in the opening paragraphs of &quot;The Hunter&quot; as &quot;big and shaggy, with flat square shoulders... His hands, swinging curve-fingered at his sides, looked like they were molded of brown clay by a sculptor who thought big and liked veins. His hair was brown and dry and dead, blowing around his head like a poor toupee about to fly loose. His face was a chipped chunk of concrete, with eyes of flawed onyx. His mouth was a quick stroke, bloodless.&quot; When asked about who he would cast as Parker, Westlake stated: &quot;Usually I don’t put an actor’s face to the character, though with Parker, in the early days, I did think he probably looked something like Jack Palance. That may be partly because you knew Palance wasn’t faking it, and Parker wasn’t faking it either. Never once have I caught him winking at the reader.&quot; In &quot;The Man With the Getaway Face&quot;, Parker has plastic surgery in an attempt to evade The Outfit&#x27;s retribution, so he&#x27;s no longer recognizable to most who knew him before, though his general appearance (and the impression it makes on others) seems to be largely unchanged.

In terms of his interactions with others, Parker dislikes small talk, and has little use for social pleasantries. Instead, he prefers to converse as little as possible, and will end conversations abruptly once he feels that he has obtained the information he requires. Parker has few interests outside his work, and when he is planning or executing a heist, he is focused on it to the exclusion of almost everything else. However, once the heist is complete, Parker has an almost overwhelming desire to have sex. Though he has a wide range of professional contacts, Parker has no friends.

His first name is never revealed in the series, a decision Westlake has stated he made when thinking that &quot;The Hunter&quot; would be a standalone book and which he stuck to even though it complicated writing the subsequent books. Westlake himself never definitively settled on a first name for the character, once musing &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the hell it would be, maybe Frank.&quot;

No mention is ever made of Parker&#x27;s family. While the events of previous novels are frequently referred to throughout the series, very little that happened in Parker&#x27;s life before his appearance in &quot;The Hunter&quot; is ever discussed. In &quot;The Outfit&quot;, it is stated that he had been in the Army from 1942 to 1944 and had been given a bad conduct discharge for blackmarketeering.

The closest Westlake has ever come to alluding to Parker&#x27;s childhood is in the novel &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Moon&quot;, when Parker surveys the fictional city of Tyler and thinks to himself that it is a very different place from where he grew up. As well, in &quot;The Sour Lemon Score&quot;, it&#x27;s mentioned that Parker was &quot;born and raised in cities&quot;, but no further details are offered. In &quot;The Outfit&quot; (which explicitly takes place in late 1963) Parker does state he had already been a thief for 18 years, and refers to a heist he committed in 1949. In Chapter 3 of &quot;The Man With the Getaway Face&quot; it is mentioned that Parker &quot;owned a couple parking lots and gas stations around the country&quot;. He has virtually no involvement with the operation of these businesses, allowing the managers to skim profits in exchange for creating the appearance of Parker having a legitimate source of income to avoid suspicion from &quot;internal revenue beagles&quot;.

In the essay &quot;The Gentrification of Crime&quot;, which appeared in the March 28, 1985 issue of &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Lucy Sante (then known as Luc Sante) offered the following analysis of the character:

In Parker&#x27;s world there is no good or evil, but simply different styles of crime. There is no law, so Parker cannot be caught, but merely injured or delayed. The subversive implication is not that crime pays, but that all business is crime. Among the Homeric epithets that follow Parker from book to book is: &#x27;He had to be a businessman of some kind. The way he looked, big and square and hard, it had to be a tough and competitive business; used cars maybe, or jukeboxes.&#x27; He is a loner, competing with conglomerates (the syndicate) and fending off marginal elements (psychotics, amateurs). He has no interest in society except as a given, like the weather, and none in power. He is a freebooter who acquires money in order to buy himself periods of vegetative quiet.

Contrary to what Sante says, Parker was arrested and imprisoned twice in the series—first in &quot;The Hunter&quot; for vagrancy, then much later, in &quot;Breakout&quot; after a heist goes wrong. In both cases, his real identity wasn&#x27;t known to the authorities at the time of arrest, and he escaped both times from facilities with relatively low security. However, Parker&#x27;s always very aware that the law is out there, and that his fingerprints are linked to the murder of a guard at a prison camp—which means that he has no chance of ever being released if caught and properly identified. In the original version of &quot;The Hunter&quot; submitted to publishers, Parker was stopped by the police at the end, and killed trying to escape. Bucklin Moon, an editor for Pocket Books, said he&#x27;d buy the novel, on condition that Parker got away, so that he could appear in a series of books, instead of just one.

In a similar tone, author Ian Sansom, in &quot;The Guardian&quot; (March 3, 2007), wrote of Parker as

...always restless, always on the move; forever hunted, forever hunting, crisscrossing the country following the mighty dollar, trying to make his way in the only way he knows how: through scheming, cheating, and the exercise of brute force. But Parker is by no means merely evil, merciless or insane; the brilliance of the books lies in their blurring of the distinction between madness and sanity, justice and mercy. Parker is not so much sick as blank, with the deep blankness of... humanity stripped to its essentials... [he is] callous, unable to feel guilt for his actions, completely lacking in empathy and incapable of learning from his own bitter experience... we admire and yearn for Parker&#x27;s demented sense of purpose: he feels no embarrassment or shame... he is never afflicted or careworn; he is, in the way of all existential heroes and madmen, somehow stenchless, blameless and utterly free.

== Novel structure ==
Westlake used the same structure for many of the Parker novels, a method that &quot;Library Review&quot; described as &quot;clever.&quot;

Each book is divided into four sections of roughly equal length, each in turn subdivided into shorter chapters. The first and second sections are written in a limited third-person perspective focused entirely on Parker as he plans and undertakes a robbery or heist with colleagues. The second section ends on a cliffhanger, as Parker is betrayed—often injured and left for dead. Section three shifts to the perspective of Parker&#x27;s opponents, usually in flashback as they plan and execute their double-cross. Section four returns to Parker&#x27;s perspective as he survives the plot against him and sets out for revenge.

== Appearances ==
===Novels by Richard Stark===
The first novel in Parker&#x27;s series is &quot;The Hunter&quot; (adapted to film twice: as &quot;Point Blank&quot; in 1967, and as &quot;Payback&quot; in 1999), in which he chases a past associate who betrayed him in a heist and left him for dead. He survives, but is arrested by the police. Slowly and methodically, Parker tracks down Mal Resnick, his former accomplice, who intimidated Parker&#x27;s weak-willed wife into shooting her husband after the job had been completed. When the gambling syndicate known as The Outfit refuses to return to Parker his share of the loot Resnick gave them to make good on a debt, Parker takes on The Outfit as well, a storyline that figures in several subsequent books in the series.

In subsequent novels, Parker is often at work, putting together a team of professionals to plan and execute daring heists. Parker&#x27;s numerous memorable adventures include robbing an entire town in &quot;The Score&quot;, a football stadium in &quot;The Seventh&quot;, an island casino in &quot;The Handle&quot;, an Air Force base in &quot;The Green Eagle Score&quot;, and a rock concert in &quot;Deadly Edge&quot;. Always perfectly blueprinted heists, Parker&#x27;s plans tend to go awry in the execution, sometimes due to bad luck but more often due to greed or incompetence on the part of Parker&#x27;s less-experienced partners. The tension in the novels often comes from Parker having to work his way out of increasingly dangerous situations on the fly, as his carefully planned heist collapses around him—all while he tries to keep hold of both the money he stole, and his life. (And, often, he does so while endeavoring to exact revenge on those responsible for his troubles.)

Throughout the course of the series, Parker has operated under a number of pseudonyms, and it is implied that the name Parker itself is an alias. In the first novel in the series, Parker is arrested for vagrancy and is imprisoned in a work camp under the name Ronald Kasper, a name that is linked to his real fingerprints. In the next five novels in the series, &quot;The Man with the Getaway Face&quot;, &quot;The Outfit&quot;, &quot;The Mourner&quot;, &quot;The Score&quot;, and &quot;The Jugger&quot;, Parker lives comfortably in a Florida hotel under the name Charles Willis between jobs, but is forced to abandon this identity (and the money that goes with it) when police show up at his hotel at the end of &quot;The Jugger&quot;. In some later books, he uses Edward Latham as his &quot;straight&quot; name. It&#x27;s mainly other heavy heisters and people who live outside the law who know him as Parker.

In the novel &quot;The Rare Coin Score&quot;, Parker meets Claire Carroll, the woman who will become his companion for the rest of the series. They live together somewhere in northern New Jersey in a lake house owned under the name Claire Willis (she took this surname from Parker&#x27;s past). In the novel &quot;Backflash&quot;, their home is described as &quot;a house on a lake called Colliver Pond, seventy miles from New York, a deep rural corner where New York and New Jersey and Pennsylvania meet... mostly a resort community, lower-level white-collar, people who came here three months every summer and left their &#x27;cottages&#x27; unoccupied the rest of the year... For Parker, it was ideal. A place to stay, to lie low when nothing was going on, a &#x27;home&#x27; as people called it, and no neighbors. In the summer, when the clerks came out to swim and fish and boat, Parker and Claire went somewhere else.&quot;

Also appears in:

* &quot;The Blackbird&quot; (1969) by Richard Stark — Parker appears only in the first chapter of this novel starring Alan Grofield.
* &quot;Dead Skip&quot; (1972) by Joe Gores — Parker appears briefly in Chapter 18, in a sequence that was also described (from a different viewpoint) in &quot;Plunder Squad&quot; (1972). Gores hints further at the connection between the two books by referring to Parker&#x27;s associates as &quot;the plunder squad.&quot; Additionally, earlier in the novel, the book&#x27;s protagonist is described as being a reader only of Richard Stark novels.
* &quot;Jimmy the Kid&quot; (1974) by Donald E. Westlake — This novel in Westlake&#x27;s John Dortmunder series features the gang planning a caper based on a Parker novel they have. Chapters alternate between Parker committing a kidnapping (in the otherwise unavailable novel &quot;Child Heist&quot;) and the Dortmunder gang screwing it up as they try to imitate Parker. Only a few chapters of &quot;Child Heist&quot; are featured, and this particular Parker story is not complete on its own.

== Influences ==
=== Literary spinoffs and crossovers ===
The Westlake novel &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; (1970) was originally intended to feature Parker, but the plot, which involves a precious gem that is stolen, lost, stolen again, lost again, and so on seemed too comic a situation for the hard-boiled Parker, so Westlake rewrote the novel with a more bumbling and likable cast of characters, including John Dortmunder, who is Parker seen through a comic mirror. The third Dortmunder novel, &quot;Jimmy the Kid&quot; (1974), features a plot in which Dortmunder and his associates base a kidnapping on a plan from a (fictitious) Parker novel called &quot;Child Heist&quot;. Ironically, in the main Parker novels, Parker repeatedly expresses disgust for kidnappers. &quot;Good Behavior&quot; (1985) was originally intended as the seventeenth Parker novel following &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Moon&quot; (1974), but, like &quot;The Hot Rock&quot;, was rewritten for Dortmunder. &quot;Good Behavior&quot; bore the dedication &quot;To P., 1962-1974&quot;—the dates the original Parker novels were published.

The Parker novel &quot;Plunder Squad&quot; (1972) contains a brief encounter with a San Francisco detective named Kearney, who is not looking for Parker but for one of his associates. The same encounter is described from Kearney&#x27;s point of view in the Joe Gores DKA novel &quot;Dead Skip&quot; (1972). Westlake and Gores repeated the same trick in 1990 with matching sequences in the DKA novel &quot;32 Cadillacs&quot; and the Dortmunder novel &quot;Drowned Hopes&quot;.

The second Dortmunder novel, &quot;Bank Shot&quot; has Dortmunder&#x27;s new accomplice Herman X claim to have been involved in a robbery with Stan Devers, Mort Kobler (who appears in &quot;The Outfit&quot;) and George Cathcart (who briefly appears in the final Grofield novel, &quot;Lemons Never Lie&quot;). Dortmunder is familiar with Kobler and his friend Kelp knows Catchcart.

=== Portrayals ===
Parker has been portrayed numerous times in films. Westlake refused to allow productions to use the name unless a whole series of films were planned based on the novels. Substitute characters were created—starting with Lee Marvin starring as Walker in &quot;Point Blank&quot; (based on &quot;The Hunter&quot;), Michel Constantin as Georges in &quot;Pillaged&quot; (based on &quot;The Score&quot;), Anna Karina as Paula Nelson in &quot;Made in U.S.A.&quot; (partly based on &quot;The Jugger&quot;), Jim Brown as McClain in &quot;The Split&quot;, Robert Duvall as Earl Macklin in &quot;The Outfit&quot;, Peter Coyote as Stone in &quot;Slayground&quot;, and Mel Gibson as Porter in &quot;Payback&quot; (the second screen adaptation based on &quot;The Hunter&quot;).

After Westlake&#x27;s death, his widow, Abby, sold the screen rights to the novel &quot;Flashfire&quot; to producer Les Alexander and allowed for the name Parker to be used in the adaptation, with the option of further novels being adapted should the first one prove successful. Jason Statham was cast as the titular character in &quot;Parker&quot;. Over a decade later, Amazon Studios optioned the entire Parker property with the intent to launch a shared universe consisting of films and television shows. Filmmaker Shane Black wrote and directed &quot;Play Dirty&quot; based on the novel &quot;The Hunter&quot;, marking it the third time the novel has been adapted to the screen. Mark Wahlberg was cast as Parker.

=== Homages ===

Author Dan Simmons has paid homage to Westlake and his Parker character with three hard-boiled action novels featuring the character of Joe Kurtz, a past and current private investigator who spent time in Attica prison. The first novel, &quot;Hardcase&quot;, is dedicated to Richard Stark/Donald Westlake. In the third Kurtz novel, &quot;Hard as Nails&quot;, Kurtz mentions that he did not know his father, but that he was a career criminal thief who went by a single name and would have sex with women after a job, a clear reference to Parker.

Max Allan Collins authored a series of novels with a protagonist named &quot;Nolan&quot; who was an homage to Westlake&#x27;s Parker. Collins said of the character: &quot;[T]he concept was to take a Parker-like character who has reached the ancient age of 48 and wants badly to retire, and of course needs one last heist to do so.&quot;

The television series &quot;Leverage&quot; features a character named &quot;Parker&quot;. As played by Beth Riesgraf, Parker is an expert thief, cat-burglar, pickpocket and safe-cracker. Like Stark&#x27;s Parker, this character is also only known by the single name &quot;Parker&quot;.

Jim Doherty&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Ghost of Dillinger,&quot; published in the anthology &quot;Tales from the Red Lion&quot;, pits his series cop, Dan Sullivan, against a legendary criminal named &quot;Karper,&quot; whose backstory derives from Stark&#x27;s Parker novels. Doherty contacted Westlake ahead of time to get approval for this deliberate homage to his character.

The graphic novel featuring Catwoman, &quot;Selina&#x27;s Big Score&quot;, by Darwyn Cooke features a character resembling Parker, an experienced professional thief known only by his last name, Starka reference to the pseudonym used by Westlake for the Parker novels.

===Films===
* &quot;Made in USA&quot; (1966) was based on the novel &quot;The Jugger&quot; and directed by Jean-Luc Godard. It starred Anna Karina as a journalist investigating the disappearance of her boyfriend. Characters were named after the writer David Goodis, director Don Siegel and actor Richard Widmark — people influential in the genre of film noir. The film&#x27;s producer, Georges de Beauregard, did not complete payments for rights to the novel, so Westlake took him to court (after litigation Westlake was given North American distribution rights). The film had a theatrical release in the U.S. in 2009.
* &quot;Point Blank&quot; (1967, MGM) was based on the novel &quot;The Hunter&quot;. It was directed by John Boorman and starred Lee Marvin as Walker, the Parker character. The film also starred Angie Dickinson, John Vernon, Carroll O&#x27;Connor and Keenan Wynn.
* &quot;&quot;Pillaged&quot;&quot; (1967) was a French film based on the novel &quot;The Score&quot; and directed by Alain Cavalier. Michel Constantin played Georges, the Parker character, and Franco Interlenghi appeared as Maurice, the Grofield character. An English-dubbed version, titled &quot;Midnight Raid&quot;, was distributed by United Artists to some territories in 1969. The film did not have a theatrical release in the U.S. until 2013, when it was screened at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA). 
* &quot;The Split&quot; (1968, MGM) was based on the novel &quot;The Seventh&quot;. It starred Jim Brown as McClain, the Parker character. It also starred Gene Hackman, Julie Harris, Diahann Carroll, Jack Klugman, Donald Sutherland, Warren Oates, James Whitmore and Ernest Borgnine.
* &quot;The Outfit&quot; (1973, MGM) was based on the novel of the same name. It was directed by John Flynn and starred Robert Duvall as Earl Macklin, the Parker character. It also starred Joe Don Baker, Karen Black and Robert Ryan.
* &quot;Slayground&quot; (1983) was based on the novel of the same name. It was directed by Terry Bedford and starred Peter Coyote as Stone.
* &quot;Payback&quot; (1999) was based on the novel &quot;The Hunter&quot;. Writer/director Brian Helgeland was removed from the project after test screenings and new footage was written by Terry Hayes and directed by Paul Abascal. The film starred Mel Gibson as Porter, the Parker character. It also featured Gregg Henry, Maria Bello, David Paymer, Deborah Kara Unger, Kris Kristofferson, Lucy Liu and an uncredited James Coburn. Helgeland&#x27;s version was released as &quot;Payback – Straight Up: The Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; for a small theatrical run in 2006 and on DVD in 2007. This version&#x27;s plot more closely follows the novel.
* &quot;Parker&quot;, an adaptation of the novel &quot;Flashfire&quot;, was released in January 2013. Jason Statham stars as the title character, along with Jennifer Lopez, Nick Nolte, and Michael Chiklis.
* &quot;Play Dirty&quot; is an upcoming film based on &quot;The Hunter&quot;. Mark Wahlberg stars as Parker, along with LaKeith Stanfield, Rosa Salazar and Dermot Mulroney.

===Comics===
*Darwyn Cooke wrote and illustrated a graphic novel based on &quot;The Hunter&quot; published by IDW in July 2009. The story is a faithful adaptation of the novel, retaining its 1962 setting. Cooke produced the work in consultation with Westlake (who died before he could see the final product). Westlake was reportedly impressed enough that he gave his blessing for Cooke to use the name Parker for the central character—something he had not allowed with any film adaptation of the Parker novels. Cooke went on to adapt &quot;The Outfit&quot;, released in October 2010. The third adaptation, &quot;The Score&quot;, was released in July 2012, and the fourth—&quot;Slayground&quot;—was released in January 2014. &quot;Slayground&quot; also contained an adaptation of &quot;The Seventh&quot; in abbreviated form as an added bonus. The contract to adapt the series had been extended past the intended four books, as Cooke wanted very much to adapt &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Moon&quot;, and possibly others, but Cooke&#x27;s death in 2016 left these plans unfinished.

<text>The Chad national football team (, ), nicknamed Les Sao (), represents Chad in international football and is controlled by the Chadian Football Federation, the governing body for football in the country. The team has never qualified for the World Cup finals or Africa Cup of Nations. Home matches are played at the Idriss Mahamat Ouya Stadium. In April 2021, FIFA banned the Chad national football team from participating in global football over the Chadian government&#x27;s interference with the Chadian Football Federation.

==History==
The Chadian Football Federation was founded in 1962 and became affiliated to FIFA and CAF in 1988.

Chad&#x27;s national football team did not play a big role in world football until the 1990s. They did not enter any qualifiers for Continental or World Cups until the early 1990s when they played their first qualifying matches for the 1992 Africa Cup of Nations, hosted by Senegal. Until then, they played mostly friendly matches and minor cups, mostly with African teams.

The national team had a difficult start − the first match they ever played was in the L&#x27;Amitié Tournament, which took place in Senegal in 1963, and it was a 2–1 defeat to Liberia. Soon after, they suffered a 6–2 loss to Dahomey (now Benin).

The Chad national football team never qualified for either the Africa Cup of Nations or the World Cup. Their first participation in the World Cup qualifiers was in 2000 when they were eliminated in the first round by Liberia, losing 0–1 at home, and playing 0–0 away. They were coached by Marcel Mao. Their next attempt was in 2003, under Yann Djim, but they were eliminated by Angola. They won their first home game when Francis Oumar Belonga scored a hat trick, 3–1. They lost their away match 2–0, and went no further. The qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup brought more matches because they played in a group phase together with Mali, Sudan and Congo. They finished at the bottom of the group, with six points (two wins and four losses).

In the qualifying competition for the 2014 World Cup, Chad faced Tanzania in a first-round playoff. Tanzania advanced despite shockingly losing 1–0 at home at Dar es Salaam&#x27;s National Stadium. The Taifa Stars were tipped for an emphatic victory over the visitors, having won the first-leg 2–1 in N&#x27;Djamena. Chad stunned the home side three minutes after the break when Mahamat Ahmat Labo struck to silence the home crowd. But Tanzania managed to progress to the next round thanks to the away goals rule as they were tied 2–2 on aggregate.

Chad played against Malawi in the qualifiers for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. Chad won the first leg match 3–2, but lost 2–0 in Blantyre to be eliminated with an aggregate score of 4–3.

In the qualifiers for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, Malawi was the opponent once again. Chad lost 2–0 in the first leg at Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre, but they won 3–1 in at Idriss Mahamat Ouya Stadium in N&#x27;Djamena, losing on the away goals rule. Forward Robin Ngalande turned into a savior for Malawi when he came off the bench to score a crucial late goal.

The biggest achievement for Chad so far is a CEMAC Cup (Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa) title in 2014, after beating Congo 3–2 in the final on December 14 in Bata, Equatorial Guinea. French-born Emmanuel Trégoat managed the team. Their previous best was a second place in the 2005 edition, when they lost to Cameroon in the final.

&quot;Les Sao&quot; had a disappointing start into their qualifying campaign for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, losing 2–0 to Nigeria and slumping to a 5–1 defeat at home against Egypt. But it was then that things took a turn for the better, as coach Moudou Kouta, who was in charge of the side on an interim basis, took the team to an unexpected victory against Sierra Leone in the first round of the qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup. &quot;Les Sao&quot; won 1–0 at home and even though they were beaten 2–1 in the return leg, they advanced to the second round of the qualifiers on away goals. Chad sensationally defeated Egypt 1–0 at home in the second round before falling to a 4–0 defeat in Alexandria three days later.

In March 2016, the Chadian Football Federation announced they were withdrawing from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification due to financial problems. The team was subsequently banned from entering the following edition, meaning they would play no official games for over three years until September 2019, when Chad lost 1–3 at home to Sudan in 
2022 FIFA World Cup qualification. A month later &quot;Les Sao&quot; defeated Liberia on penalties to reach the Group Stage of 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification.

In March 2021, the Chadian government dissolved the Chadian Football Federation, leaving Chad facing a likely ban under FIFA regulations that prevent governments from interfering in the running of a country&#x27;s football team. In April 2021, FIFA announced an indefinite ban from global football, citing the Chadian government&#x27;s interference. Due to this decision, CAF disqualified Chad from its participation in the 2021 AFCON qualifiers.

==Kits==
During the independence of Chad, the team competed in international matches and played in a blue shirt, blue shorts, and red socks. These are the national colours of the French flag. In the 1970s, Chad&#x27;s home colors changed to blue-yellow-red. Their first away kit in 1960 was white shirt, red shorts, and white socks. In 1980, the away kit color changed into red shirt, blue shorts, and yellow socks.

<doc id="1238902" wikidata="Q3348675" url="?curid=1238902" title="Indian Antarctic Programme">
<text>The Indian Antarctic Programme is a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional programme under the control of the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India. It was initiated in 1981 with the first Indian expedition to Antarctica. The programme gained global acceptance with India&#x27;s signing of the Antarctic Treaty and subsequent construction of the Dakshin Gangotri Antarctic research base in 1983, superseded by the Maitri base from 1989. The newest base commissioned in 2012 is Bharati, constructed out of 134 shipping containers. Under the programme, atmospheric, biological, earth, chemical, and medical sciences are studied by India, which has carried out 40 scientific expeditions to the Antarctic.


==History==

The origin of the Indian missions to the Antarctic are traced to the joint Indian Space Research Organisation – Hydrometeorological Centre of Russia agreements, which led to Indians, such as Dr. Paramjit Singh Sehra, joining the 17th Soviet Antarctic expedition of 1971–1973.

India officially acceded to the Antarctic Treaty System on 1 August 1983. On 12 September 1983, the country became the fifteenth Consultative Member of the Antarctic Treaty.

==Organization==

The National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research—a research and development body functioning under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India—controls the Indian Antarctic Programme. The NCPOR and the Department of Ocean Development select the members for India&#x27;s Antarctic expeditions. After medical tests and subsequent acclimatisation training at the Himalayas, these selected members are also trained in survival, environment ethics, firefighting and operating in a group.

One expedition costs up to . Logistical support to the various activities of the Indian Antarctic Programme is provided by the relevant branches of the Indian armed forces. The launching point of Indian expeditions has varied from Goa in India to Cape Town in South Africa on 19th expedition during the time of NCAOR Founding Director Dr. P C Pandey in December 1999. Over 70 institutes in India contributed to its Antarctic Programme as of 2007.

==Global cooperation==

The Indian Antarctic Programme is bound by the rules of the Antarctic Treaty System, which India signed in 1983. Pandey (2007) outlines the various international activities that India has undertaken as a part of its Antarctic Programme:

India also collaborates with the international community as a member of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, Regional Committee of Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission in Coastal Indian Ocean (IOCINDIO), International Seabed Authority (ISBA), and the State Parties of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS).

==Research==
Antarctica holds scientific interest for global research projects due to a number of reasons: &#x27;Origin of continents, climate change, meteorology and pollution&#x27; are among the reasons cited by S.D. Gad (2008). Mrinalini G. Walawalkar (2005) holds that: &#x27;ice–ocean interaction and the global processes; paleoenvironment and paleoclimatic studies; geological evolution of earth and Gondwanaland reconstruction; Antarctic ecosystems, biodiversity and environment physiology; solar terrestrial processes and their coupling; medical physiology, adaptation techniques and human psychology; environment impact assessment and monitoring; enabling low temperature technology development; and studies on earthquakes&#x27; are among the areas of study under the Indian Antarctic Programme.

Close to 1,300 Indians had been to the continent as of 2001 as a part of the country&#x27;s Antarctic Programme. Indian expeditions to the Antarctic also study the fauna and the molecular biodiversity of the region. A total of 120 new microbes had been discovered as a result of international scientific effort in the Antarctic by 2005. 30 of these microbes had been discovered by Indian scientists. India has also published over 300 research publications based on Antarctic studies as of 2007.

The &#x27;ice cores&#x27; retrieved by drilling holes in Antarctic&#x27;s vast ice-sheets yield information &#x27;on the palaeoclimate and eco-history of the earth as records of wind-blown dust, volcanic ash or radioactivity are preserved in the ice as it gets accumulated over time&#x27;. The NCAOR developed a polar research &amp; development laboratory with a &#x27;low-temperature laboratory complex at −20 °C for preservation and analysis of ice core and snow samples&#x27; according to S.D. Gad (2008). The &#x27;ice core&#x27; samples are held, processed, and analysed in containment units designed by such technology. Storage cases made of poly propylene also ensure that the samples do not alter characteristics and are preserved for analysis in the form that they were recovered.

==Research stations==
In 1981 the Indian flag unfurled for the first time in Antarctica, marking the start of Southern Ocean expeditions under the environmental protocol of the Antarctic Treaty (1959).

=== Dakshin Gangotri ===
The first permanent settlement was built in 1983 and named Dakshin Gangotri. In 1989 it was excavated and is being used again as supply base and transit camp. Dakshin Gangotri was decommissioned in the year 1990 after half of it got buried under the ice. It is nothing more than a historical site now. In its times, it used to double up as a place for multiple support systems, including the presence of an ice-melting plant, laboratories, storage, accommodation, recreation facilities, a clinic and also a bank counter.

=== Maitri ===
The second permanent settlement, Maitri, was put up in 1989 on the Schirmacher Oasis and has been conducting experiments in geology, geography and medicine. India built this station close to a freshwater lake around Maitri known as Lake Priyadarshini. Maitri accomplished the mission of geomorphologic mapping of Schirmacher Oasis.

=== Bharati ===
Located beside Larsmann Hill at 69°S, 76°E, Bharati is established in March 2012. This newest research station for oceanographic research will collect evidence of continental break-up to reveal the 120-million-year-old ancient history of the Indian subcontinent. In news sources this station was variously spelled &quot;Bharathi&quot;, &quot;Bharti&quot; and &quot;Bharati&quot;.

=== India Post Office in Antarctica ===
It was established in the year 1984 during the third Indian expedition to Antarctica. It was located at Dakshin Gangotri. As many as 10,000 letters were posted and cancelled in this post office in total in the first year of its establishment. Although the post office is no more there, it is a favourite stopover for Indian tourists who visit the place in cruise ships.

The current Indian post office in Antarctica is situated at Maitri, where the country&#x27;s current research station is also situated.

<doc id="1238911" wikidata="Q1241738" url="?curid=1238911" title="M3U">
<text>M3U (&quot;MP3 URL&quot; or Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3 Uniform Resource Locator in full) is a computer file format for a multimedia playlist. One common use of the M3U file format is creating a single-entry playlist file pointing to a stream on the Internet. The created file provides easy access to that stream and is often used in downloads from a website, for emailing, and for listening to Internet radio.

Although originally designed for audio files, such as MP3, it is commonly used to point media players to audio and video sources, including online sources. M3U was originally developed by Fraunhofer for use with their WinPlay3 software, but numerous media players and software applications now support the format.

Careless handling of M3U playlists has been the cause of vulnerabilities in many music players such as VLC media player, iTunes, Winamp, and many others.

==File format==
There is no formal specification for the M3U format; it is a &quot;de facto&quot; standard.

An M3U file is a plain text file that specifies the locations of one or more media files. The file is saved with the &quot;m3u&quot; filename extension if the text is encoded in the local system&#x27;s default non-Unicode encoding (e.g., a Windows codepage), or with the &quot;m3u8&quot; extension if the text is UTF-8 encoded.

Each entry carries one specification. The specification can be any one of the following:
* an &quot;absolute local pathname&quot;; e.g., C:\My Music\Heavysets.mp3
* a &quot;local pathname&quot; relative to the M3U file location; e.g. Heavysets.mp3
* a URL

Each entry ends with a line break which separates it from the following one. Furthermore, some devices only accept line breaks represented as codice_1, but do not recognize a single codice_2.

===Extended M3U===
The M3U file can also include comments, prefaced by the &quot;#&quot; character. In extended M3U, &quot;#&quot; also introduces extended M3U directives which are terminated by a colon &quot;:&quot; if they support parameters.

Apple used the extended M3U format as a base for their HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) which was documented in an Independent Submission Stream RFC in 2017 as RFC 8216. Therein, a &quot;master playlist&quot; references segment playlists which usually contain URLs for short parts of the media stream. Some tags only apply to the former type and some only to the latter type of playlist, but they all begin with codice_3. 

===M3U8===
The Unicode version of M3U is M3U8, which uses UTF-8-encoded characters. M3U8 files are the basis for the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) format originally developed by Apple to stream video and radio to iOS devices, and which is now a popular format for adaptive streaming in general.

The 2015 proposal for the HLS playlist format uses UTF-8 exclusively and does not distinguish between the &quot;m3u&quot; and &quot;m3u8&quot; file name extensions.

==Internet media types==

The only Internet media type registered for M3U and M3U8 is codice_4, registered in 2009 and only referring to the playlist format as used in HLS applications.

The current proposal for the HLS playlist format acknowledges two media types which it treats as equivalent: codice_4 and codice_6. Likewise, these are the two types recommended for HLS use by Microsoft.

For non-HLS applications, no media types were standardized or registered with the IANA, but a number of media types are nonetheless associated with the historical and ongoing use of the M3U and M3U8 formats for general playlists:
* codice_7
* codice_8
* codice_6
* codice_10

These types, plus codice_4 and codice_12, are supported for HLS applications by (for example) Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 10 and Internet Explorer 9, and LG&#x27;s WebOS.

==Examples==
;Example 1
This is an example of an extended M3U file on the Windows platform. Sample.mp3 and Example.ogg are the media files. 123 and 321 are the lengths in seconds. A length of -1 or 0 may be used when the media file is a streaming file, as there is no actual, predefined length value. The value after the length is the title to be shown, which is generally the same as the location of the file which is on the second line. On the macOS and Linux platforms, Unix paths are used.
 #EXTM3U
 #EXTINF:123, Sample artist - Sample title
 C:\Documents and Settings\I\My Music\Sample.mp3
 #EXTINF:321,Example Artist - Example title
 C:\Documents and Settings\I\My Music\Greatest Hits\Example.ogg

;Example 2
This example shows how to create an m3u file linking to a specified directory (for example, a flash drive, or CD-ROM). The m3u file should contain only one string: the path to the directory. After starting, the media player will play all contents of the directory:
 C:\Music

;Example 3
Here is another example, using relative format. The M3U file is placed in the same directory as the music, and directories must be preserved when moving the playlist to another device if subdirectories are used. This method is more flexible, as it does not rely on the file path staying the same.

This is the same file as above, saved as sample.m3u in C:\Documents and Settings\User\My Music\
 #EXTM3U
 #EXTINF:123, Sample artist - Sample title
 Sample.mp3
 #EXTINF:321,Example Artist - Example title
 Greatest Hits\Example.ogg

This format in an M3U allows copying to another device for playback. All files and directories referred to must also be copied.

;Example 4
Here is a mixed example:
 Alternative\Band - Song.mp3
 Classical\Other Band - New Song.mp3
 Stuff.mp3
 D:\More Music\Foo.mp3
 ..\Other Music\Bar.mp3
 http://www.example.com:8000/Listen.mp3
 http://www.example.com/~user/Mine.mp3

Notes:
* Alternative and Classical are sub-directories of the directory that this playlist is stored in.
* &quot;Song&quot; and &quot;New Song&quot; are in sub-directories of the directory that this playlist is stored in.
* &quot;Stuff&quot; is in the same directory that the playlist is stored in.
* &quot;Foo&quot; is in the specified (Windows) volume and directory, which may or may not be the same directory the playlist is in.
* &quot;Bar&quot; is in a different directory at the same level as the playlist directory. The double-dots reference the parent directory of the playlist directory, then into the sub-directory &quot;Other Music&quot; to reach &quot;Bar&quot;.
* &quot;Listen&quot; is a Shoutcast stream.
* &quot;Mine&quot; is an MP3 stored on a web server.

;Example 5

References to other M3U playlists, for example, are generally not well-supported.

 AnotherPlayList.m3u

;Example 6
The following is an example of an M3U playlist file for &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; album by &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; that was created by Mp3tag with the following custom option settings: 
* playlist extended info format = codice_13
* playlist filename format = codice_14
* tag to filename conversion format = codice_15

<doc id="1238913" wikidata="Q291049" url="?curid=1238913" title="Marjorie Bruce">
<text>Marjorie Bruce or Marjorie de Brus (1316 or 1317) was the eldest daughter of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, and the only child born of his first marriage with Isabella of Mar.

Marjorie&#x27;s marriage to Walter, High Steward of Scotland, gave rise to the House of Stewart. Her son was the first Stewart monarch, King Robert II of Scotland.

==Early life==
Her mother, Isabella, was a noblewoman from the Clan Mar. Marjorie was named after her father&#x27;s mother, Marjorie, Countess of Carrick. Soon after giving birth to Marjorie, at the age of 19, Isabella died. Marjorie&#x27;s father was at that time the Earl of Carrick.

According to legend, Marjorie&#x27;s parents had been very much in love, and Robert the Bruce did not remarry until 1302 (six years after his first wife&#x27;s death), to a courtier named Elizabeth de Burgh.

On 27 March 1306, her father was crowned King of Scots at Scone, Perthshire.

==Imprisonment==
Three months after the coronation, in June, 1306, her father was defeated at the Battle of Methven. He sent his wife, two sisters, and Marjorie north with his supporter Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, but by the end of June they were captured by Uilleam II, Earl of Ross, a Balliol supporter, who handed them over to the English.

As punishment, Edward I of England sent his hostages to different places in England. Marjorie was sent to the convent at Watton. Her aunt, Christina Bruce, was sent to another convent. Elizabeth de Burgh was placed under house arrest at a manor house in Yorkshire. Elizabeth de Burgh&#x27;s punishment was lighter than the others. This is due to the fact that Edward I needed the support of her father, the powerful Earl of Ulster. Marjorie&#x27;s aunt, Mary Bruce, and the Countess of Buchan were imprisoned in wooden cages, exposed to public view, at Roxburgh Castle and Berwick Castle, respectively.

For the next four years, Elizabeth, Christina, Mary, and Isabella endured solitary confinement. The latter two experienced daily public humiliation. A cage was built for Marjorie, who was around the age of 12, at the Tower of London, but Edward I reconsidered. He instead sent her to the Gilbertine convent in Watton. Christopher Seton, Christina&#x27;s husband, was executed.

Edward I died on 7 July 1307. He was succeeded by his son, Edward II, who subsequently held Marjorie captive in a convent for about seven more years. She was freed in October 1314, in exchange for Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford captured after the Battle of Bannockburn.

==Marriage and death==

Upon the liberation of Elizabeth de Burgh and Marjorie from their long captivity in England, Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland, was sent to receive them at the Anglo-Scottish border and conduct them back to the Scottish court. He later married Marjorie. Her dowry included the Barony of Bathgate in West Lothian.

The traditional story is that two years later, on 2 March 1316, Marjorie was riding in Gallowhill, Paisley, Renfrewshire while heavily pregnant. Her horse was suddenly startled and threw her to the ground. She went into premature labour and her child, Robert II of Scotland, was born. Marjorie died soon afterward at the age of around 20, like her mother, who was roughly the same age when she died in childbirth. However, it is not clear that this traditional story is correct; some accounts indicate that she may have survived into 1317. She may still have died in a riding accident, but this could have taken place after the birth of her son. In fact, one source states that she died in October 1317, after falling from a horse, during a second pregnancy. Following the same October 1317 tradition, the Renfrewshire historian Crawford recorded circa 1710 that local tradition reported she was &quot;riding betwixt Pasly and the Castle of Renfrew, then the principal Residence of the Great Stewart of Scotland, her Husband, she was thrown from her Horse, and by the fall suffered a Dislocation of the Vertebrae of her Neck; she, being pregnant, fell in Labour (of King Robert II.) the child or Faetus, as they report, was a Cesar[ian]: The Operation being by an unskilful Hand, his Eye was touch&#x27;d by the Instrument, which afterwards proved incurable, from which he was called King Bleareie [ie. bleery eye]; she died upon the Spot: And on the Fatal Place where this Accident happened, there was erected a Cross, yet standing, called Queen Bleareie&#x27;s Cross.&quot; This tradition appears to conflate the dates and facts from other known sources, however authentic references to the sight affliction occurring in infancy, and the related nickname, are lacking.

At the junction of Renfrew Road and Dundonald Road in Paisley, a cairn marks the spot called &quot;the Knock&quot;, near where Marjorie reputedly fell from her horse. Bruce Road and Marjorie Drive are named in her honour. She is buried at Paisley Abbey.

Her son succeeded his childless uncle David II of Scotland in 1371 as King Robert II. Her descendants include the House of Stewart (now styled Stuart) and all their successors on the throne of Scotland, England and the United Kingdom.

==Marjorie in fiction==
The young adult novel &quot;Girl in a Cage&quot;, by Jane Yolen and Robert J. Harris, features Marjorie Bruce as its protagonist. In it, Marjorie is imprisoned in a cage. Although there is a preface stating that it is fictional, many have taken it to be a true story.

The historical fiction novel &quot;Spirit of Fire: The Tale of Marjorie Bruce &quot; (2016), by the young author Emmerson Brand, features Marjorie Bruce as its protagonist.

In the historical action drama film &quot;Outlaw King&quot; (2018), Marjorie is featured as a minor character during the First War of Scottish Independence.

==Commemoration==
The original site of Bathgate Castle, which was part of her dowry, can be found on the grounds of Bathgate Golf Club. The site is protected by Historic Environment Scotland and the club is barred from carrying out any excavation work on the site without prior permission. Every year on the first Saturday of June, the town of Bathgate celebrates the marriage of Marjorie and Walter in their annual historical pageant, just before the town&#x27;s Bathgate Procession and Community Festival (formerly Bathgate Procession and John Newland Festival. Local school children are given the parts of Marjorie, Walter, and other members of the court. After the pageant, everyone joins the procession along with Robert the Bruce on horseback.

<doc id="1238914" wikidata="Q1163555" url="?curid=1238914" title="Easy Living (1937 film)">
<text>Easy Living is a 1937 American screwball comedy film, directed by Mitchell Leisen, written by Preston Sturges from a story by Vera Caspary, and starring Jean Arthur, Edward Arnold, and Ray Milland. Many of the supporting players (William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn, Luis Alberni, Robert Greig, Olaf Hytten, and Arthur Hoyt) became a major part of Sturges&#x27; regular stock company of character actors in his subsequent films.

Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin composed the song &quot;Easy Living&quot; for the film, and it has since become a jazz standard, made famous by Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and many other jazz singers.

The film is unrelated to a 1949 RKO drama by the same name.

==Plot==
J.B. Ball, the third richest banker in America, has a fight with his son John Jr. over breakfast. It ends with the son leaving, determined to prove that he can make his own way. Ball becomes infuriated after learning that his wife Jenny bought a $58,000 sable fur coat, and he decides it has to be returned. After finding many fur coats in her closet, Ball grabs the sable coat. Jenny takes it from him, and a chase takes them to the roof of their New York City penthouse. He throws it over the edge.

It lands on Mary Smith while she is riding to work on a double-decker bus. When she tries to return it, he tells her to keep it, without telling her how costly it is. He also buys her an expensive new hat to replace the one damaged in the incident, causing Van Buren, the owner of the shop, to mistake her for Ball&#x27;s mistress. Van Buren loses no time in spreading the word. When Mary shows up for work, her straitlaced boss suspects her of behaving improperly to get a coat she obviously cannot afford and fires her to protect the reputation of the &quot;Boy&#x27;s Constant Companion&quot;, the magazine he publishes.

Mary is nearly penniless, but she begins receiving offers from people eager to cash in on her notoriety. Hotel owner Mr. Louis Louis installs her in a luxury suite, hoping that this will deter Ball from foreclosing on his failing establishment. When Mary goes to an automat for a meal, she meets John Jr., who is working there anonymously. However, he is fired for giving Mary free food and starting a food fight. When Mary finds out he has no place to stay, she invites him to share her enormous suite while he looks for a new job. They quickly fall in love. Meanwhile, J.B.&#x27;s wife goes to Florida, he moves into the Hotel Louis, and reports of a nonexistent affair make their way into gossip columns. The hotel instantly becomes popular with the elite, and various luxury firms begin giving Mary jewelry, clothes, and a sixteen-cylinder car.

Mary&#x27;s supposed connection to J.B. has disastrous consequences for the stock market. Stockbroker E.F. Hulgar asks her for inside information about steel from Mr. Ball. The only Ball the confused Mary knows is John Jr., so she consults him. He jokingly tells her it is going down, and she passes this along to Hulgar. As a result, everybody begins selling just as J.B. starts buying, causing his firm to teeter on the brink of bankruptcy. Jenny returns from Florida. When Mary, John, and J.B. finally get together and figure out what is going on, John comes up with a bright solution: Mary tells Hulgar that J.B. has cornered the market on steel. Prices shoot up, rescuing the beleaguered financier. The delighted J.B. gives his son a job, and John Jr. asks Mary to be his wife.

Preston Sturges had signed a deal with Paramount in 1936, and &quot;Easy Living&quot; was his first assignment for them. Although putatively based on a story by Vera Caspary, Sturges in fact supposedly kept almost nothing of it except the fur coat. When a studio executive rejected the script because &quot;1936 was not the time for comedies&quot;, Sturges took the script directly to Mitchell Leisen, of which Sturges said &quot;going to a director over the head of my producer was not a sagacious move&quot;.

Preston based the Hotel Louis on the Waldorf Towers, which was a financial flop when it first opened.

Adolphe Menjou was to have been in the cast of &quot;Easy Living&quot;, but was forced to withdraw due to illness. The minor surgery of director Leisen caused production to be postponed a week to April 5, 1937.

Leisen said that Ray Milland got stuck in the tub while shooting the bathtub scene, and although the incident wasn&#x27;t in the script, Leisen kept the camera rolling and inserted the bit into the film. The phone gag with Esther Dale as the secretary was based on the behavior of Leisen&#x27;s secretary, who got the phones on her desk mixed up.

Under the belief that an actress needs to be satisfied with the way she will look in order to devote all her attention to her acting, Leisen personally directed all of Arthur&#x27;s wardrobe and hair tests, and went so far as to style her hair himself. (Leisen had come to directing from the world of costume design and art direction).

Leisen&#x27;s pains paid off – the shy and nervous Jean Arthur had a reputation for being difficult, but the director had no trouble with her on &quot;Easy Living&quot;, which was all the more surprising since Arthur was in the middle of a bitter dispute with Columbia Pictures&#x27; Harry Cohn. Dissatisfied with the films Columbia was putting her in, she wanted out of her contract. (Arthur was contractually able to do two outside pictures a year, which is why she could do &quot;Easy Living&quot; for Paramount).

It has been reported in Jean Arthur&#x27;s biography and elsewhere (Bob Dorian on American Movie Classics a few years ago) that the jewels and furs Arthur wore in the film were genuine, and that guards were posted during the filming.

A legal dispute between Twentieth-Century Fox and Paramount over the source for the film threatened to hold up its release. Fox asserted that the film was based on a Hungarian play called &quot;Der Komet&quot; by Attila Orbok, which they owned and had used as the basis for &quot;My Lips Betray&quot; (1933) and were planning to use as the basis for an upcoming Sonja Henie film, &quot;Thin Ice&quot;. Fox eventually backed off their claim of infringement, and &quot;Easy Living&quot; was released as scheduled on July 7, 1937.

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;Easy Living&quot; a &quot;poor imitation [of &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;]&quot;, adding that &quot;[unlike the latter, this one lacks] spontaneity and cleverness&quot;.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100 percent based on 10 critics, with an average rating of 7.9/10.

<doc id="1238920" wikidata="Q7169368" url="?curid=1238920" title="Permutation automaton">
<text>In automata theory, a permutation automaton, or pure-group automaton, is a deterministic finite automaton such that each input symbol permutes the set of states.

Formally, a deterministic finite automaton may be defined by the tuple (&quot;Q&quot;, Σ, δ, &quot;q&quot;&quot;0&quot;, &quot;F&quot;),
where &quot;Q&quot; is the set of states of the automaton, Σ is the set of input symbols, δ is the transition function that takes a state &quot;q&quot; and an input symbol &quot;x&quot; to a new state δ(&quot;q&quot;,&quot;x&quot;), &quot;q&quot;&quot;0&quot; is the initial state of the automaton, and &quot;F&quot; is the set of accepting states (also: final states) of the automaton. is a permutation automaton if and only if, for every two distinct states and in &quot;Q&quot; and every input symbol in Σ, δ(&quot;qi&quot;,&quot;x&quot;) ≠ δ(&quot;qj&quot;,&quot;x&quot;).

A formal language is p-regular (also: a pure-group language) if it is accepted by a permutation automaton. For example, the set of strings of even length forms a p-regular language: it may be accepted by a permutation automaton with two states in which every transition replaces one state by the other.

== Applications ==
The pure-group languages were the first interesting family of regular languages for which the star height problem was proved to be computable.

Another mathematical problem on regular languages is the &quot;separating words problem&quot;, which asks for the size of a smallest deterministic finite automaton that distinguishes between two given words of length at most &quot;n&quot; – by accepting one word and rejecting the other. The known upper bound in the general case is formula_1. The problem was later studied for the restriction to permutation automata. In this case, the known upper bound changes to formula_2.

<doc id="1238924" wikidata="Q1961133" url="?curid=1238924" title="United Communist Party (Netherlands)">
<text>United Communist Party ( or VCP) is a small communist party in the Netherlands, formed in 1999, and mainly based in Oldambt and Pekela. It is a break-away party from the New Communist Party of the Netherlands (NCPN).

==History==
The VCP was created as a local split of the NCPN in north-east Groningen. The NCPN was created in 1992 by members of the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN) who opposed the merger of the CPN with other leftwing parties to form GroenLinks in the late eighties. North-east Groningen is historically a bulwark of support for the CPN, and later the NCPN.

The main reason of the split lied in a disagreement surrounding a large construction project, consisting of mainly expensive villas, called Blauwestad. The Scheemda chapter of the NCPN was opposed to the plan, while the Reiderland chapter was in favor. In Reiderland the NCPN was part of the governing coalition, whereas in Scheemda the party was part of the opposition. In 1999 this disagreement led to a definite split, with the Scheemda chapter forming the VCP.

In 2009, the municipalities of Scheemda and Reiderland merged to form the new municipality of Oldambt. Both the NCPN and the VCP contested the elections in the new municipality, however only the VCP won representation.

==Election results==


==Ideology==
The VCP describes itself as a party based upon scientific socialism as developed by Marx, Engels and Lenin. The party strives to eliminate, through democratic means, all elements of capitalism and its outgrowths, such as fascism, national socialism and all other forms of suppression and exploitation. In its day to day political work in Oldambt, the party focuses on transparancy and the support of grassroots actions.

<doc id="1238936" wikidata="Q538508" url="?curid=1238936" title="Donald E. Westlake">
<text>Donald Edwin Westlake (July 12, 1933 – December 31, 2008) was an American writer with more than one hundred novels and non-fiction books to his credit. He specialized in crime fiction, especially comic capers, with an occasional foray into science fiction and other genres. Westlake created two professional criminal characters who each starred in a long-running series: the relentless, hardboiled Parker (published under the pen name Richard Stark), and John Dortmunder, who featured in a more humorous series.

He was a three-time Edgar Award winner and, alongside Joe Gores and William L. DeAndrea, was one of few writers to win Edgars in three different categories (1968, Best Novel, &quot;God Save the Mark&quot;; 1990, Best Short Story, &quot;Too Many Crooks&quot;; 1991, Best Motion Picture Screenplay, &quot;The Grifters&quot;). In 1993, the Mystery Writers of America named Westlake a Grand Master, the highest honor bestowed by the society.

==Personal life==
Westlake was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Lillian (Bounds) and Albert Joseph Westlake, and was raised in Albany, New York.

Westlake wrote constantly in his teens, and after 200 rejections, his first short story sale was in 1954. Sporadic short story sales followed over the next few years, while Westlake attended Champlain College (a now defunct college created in the post WWII GI Bill boom) of Plattsburgh, New York, and Binghamton University in Binghamton, New York. He also spent two years in the United States Air Force.

Westlake moved to New York City in 1959, initially to work for a literary agency while writing on the side. By 1960, he was writing full-time. His first novel under his own name, &quot;The Mercenaries&quot;, was published in 1960; over the next 48 years, Westlake published a variety of novels and short stories under his own name and a number of pseudonyms.

He was married three times, the final time to Abigail Westlake (also known as Abby Adams Westlake and Abby Adams), a writer of nonfiction (her two published books are &quot;An Uncommon Scold&quot; and &quot;The Gardener&#x27;s Gripe Book&quot;). The couple moved from New York City to Ancram in upstate New York in 1990.

Westlake died of a heart attack on December 31, 2008, while on the way to a New Year&#x27;s Eve dinner in Mexico, where he and his wife were on vacation.

==Pseudonyms==
In addition to writing consistently under his own name, Westlake published under several pseudonyms. In the order they debuted:

* Rolfe Passer: An early Westlake story was published under this name in &quot;Mystery Digest&quot; in 1958. Rolfe Passer was actually the assistant editor of the magazine at the time. It is not known why the story was published under Passer&#x27;s name; frequent Westlake collaborator Lawrence Block has suggested &quot;editorial incompetence&quot;.
* Richard Stark: Westlake&#x27;s best-known continuing pseudonym was that of Richard Stark. The Stark pseudonym was notable both for the sheer amount of writing credited to it (far more than any other except Westlake&#x27;s real name itself), as well as for Stark&#x27;s particular style of writing, which was colder, darker, less sentimental, and less overtly humorous than Westlake&#x27;s usual prose. For a period in the late 1960s, the popularity of the Parker series made Stark&#x27;s name more well-known and more lucrative for Westlake than his real name. According to Westlake, he chose the name &quot;Richard Stark&quot; for actor Richard Widmark, whose performance in the film &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; impressed Westlake: &quot;part of the character&#x27;s fascination and danger is his unpredictability. He&#x27;s fast and mean, and that&#x27;s what I wanted the writing to be: crisp and lean, no fat, trimmed down ... &quot;stark&quot;.&quot; Westlake described the difference between Stark&#x27;s style and his usual style in a 2001 article for the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;: &quot;Stark and Westlake use language very differently. To some extent they&#x27;re mirror images. Westlake is allusive, indirect, referential, a bit rococo. Stark strips his sentences down to the necessary information.&quot; Stark debuted in 1959, with a story in &quot;Mystery Digest&quot;. Four other Stark short stories followed through 1961, including &quot;The Curious Facts Preceding My Execution&quot;, later the title story in Westlake&#x27;s first short-story collection. Then, from 1962 to 1974, sixteen novels about the relentless and remorseless professional thief Parker and his accomplices (including larcenous actor Alan Grofield) appeared and were credited to Richard Stark. After &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Moon&quot; in 1974, Westlake unexpectedly found himself unable to tap into what he called Stark&#x27;s &quot;personality.&quot; Despite repeated attempts to bring him back, Westlake was unsatisfied. Years later, when Westlake had been hired to write the screenplay for &quot;The Grifters,&quot; director Stephen Frears was so impressed by its lean, cold attitude that he insisted that the screenplay had been written by Stark, not Westlake, and even tried to get Stark&#x27;s name officially credited as the writer. Westlake said that &quot;I got out of that one by explaining Richard Stark wasn&#x27;t a member of the Writer&#x27;s Guild. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a joiner, actually.&quot; Stark was inactive until 1997, when Westlake once again began writing and publishing Parker novels under Stark&#x27;s name beginning with &quot;Comeback&quot;. The University of Chicago began republishing the Richard Stark novels in 2008. 
* Alan Marshall (or Alan Marsh): Westlake acknowledged writing as many as 28 paperback soft-porn titles from 1959 to 1964 under these names; titles include &quot;All My Lovers, Man Hungry, All About Annette, Sally, Virgin&#x27;s Summer, Call Me Sinner, Off Limits&quot;, and three featuring the character of Phil Crawford: &quot;Apprentice Virgin&quot;, &quot;All the Girls Were Willing&quot;, and &quot;Sin Prowl&quot;. Westlake was not the only author to work under Marshall&#x27;s name, claiming: &quot;The publishers would either pay more for the names they already knew or would only buy from (those) names…so it became common practice for several of us to loan our names to friends…. Before…the end of 1961…six other people, friends of mine, published books as Alan Marshall, with my permission but without the publishers&#x27; knowledge.&quot; Two novels published in 1960 by Midwood Books were co-authored by Westlake and Lawrence Block (who used the pen-name &quot;Sheldon Lord&quot;) and were credited to &quot;Sheldon Lord and Alan Marshall&quot;: &quot;A Girl Called Honey&quot;, dedicated to Westlake and Block, and &quot;So Willing&quot;, dedicated to &quot;Nedra and Loretta,&quot; who were (at that time) Westlake and Block&#x27;s wives.
*James Blue: one-shot pseudonym, used as a third name circa 1959 when both Westlake and Stark already had stories in a magazine issue. In actuality, the name of Westlake&#x27;s cat.
* Ben Christopher: one-shot pseudonym for a 1960 story in &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; magazine, based on the characters from the TV show of the same name.
* John Dexter: a house pseudonym used by Nightstand Books for the work of numerous authors. The very first novel credited to John Dexter is a soft-core work by Westlake called &quot;No Longer A Virgin&quot; (1960)
* Andrew Shaw: pseudonym used by Westlake and Lawrence Block for their 1961 collaborative soft-core novel &quot;Sin Hellcat&quot;. Like John Dexter (above), &quot;Andrew Shaw&quot; was a house pseudonym used by a wide variety of authors.
* Edwin West: &quot;Brother and Sister, Campus Doll, Young and Innocent&quot;, all 1961; &quot;Strange Affair&quot;, 1962; &quot;Campus Lovers&quot;, 1963, one 1966 short story.
* John B. Allan: &quot;Elizabeth Taylor: A Fascinating Story of America&#x27;s Most Talented Actress and the World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Woman&quot;, 1961, biography.
* Don Holliday: pseudonym used by Westlake for two collaborative soft-core novels (with various authors, including Hal Dresner and Lawrence Block) in 1963/64.
* Curt Clark: debuted in 1964 with the short story &quot;Nackles&quot;. Novel: &quot;Anarchaos&quot;, 1967, science fiction.
* Barbara Wilson: one co-authored novel with Laurence Janifer (&quot;The Pleasures We Know&quot;, 1964); Janifer also used this name for at least one solo novel with no involvement from Westlake.
* Tucker Coe: five mystery novels featuring the character of Mitch Tobin: &quot;Kinds of Love, Kinds of Death&quot;, 1966; &quot;Murder Among Children&quot;, 1967; &quot;Wax Apple&quot; and &quot;A Jade in Aries&quot;, both 1970; &quot;Don&#x27;t Lie to Me&quot;, 1972.
* P. N. Castor: pseudonym used for one 1966 short story co-authored with Dave Foley.
* Timothy J. Culver: &quot;Ex Officio&quot;, 1970, thriller.
* J. Morgan Cunningham: &quot;Comfort Station&quot;, 1971, humor. Cover features the blurb, &quot;I wish I had written this book! – Donald E. Westlake.&quot;
* Samuel Holt: four mystery novels featuring the character of Sam Holt, 1986-1989: &quot;One of Us is Wrong&quot; and &quot;I Know a Trick Worth Two of That&quot;, both 1986; &quot;What I Tell You Three Times is False&quot;, 1987; &quot;The Fourth Dimension is Death&quot;, 1989. Westlake used the Holt pseudonym as an experiment to see if he could succeed as an author under a new name; he was dismayed when his publisher revealed the true identity of &quot;Holt&quot; simultaneously with the release of the first book. Westlake subsequently delivered all four books he had contracted for as Holt, but abandoned plans to write at least two further books in the series.
* Judson Jack Carmichael: &quot;The Scared Stiff&quot;, 2002, mystery; UK editions dropped the pseudonym.

Westlake sometimes made playful use of his pseudonyms in his work:
* John Dortmunder and associates plan a kidnapping based on a mythical Richard Stark/Parker novel in Westlake&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy The Kid&quot;. Stark himself makes an appearance in the novel.
* Richard Stark&#x27;s character of Parker has ID that gives his name as &quot;John B. Allan&quot;.
* In the film version of &quot;The Grifters&quot; (for which Westlake wrote the screenplay), a key scene takes place at the firm of Stark, Coe and Fellows. Westlake explains the in-joke in the film&#x27;s DVD commentary track, noting that he wrote books as &quot;Richard Stark, Tucker Coe and some other fellows.&quot; Westlake had been asked to write the script for &quot;The Grifters&quot; using the pen-name &quot;Richard Stark&quot; as an in-joke, but insisted on using his own name.
* A character in Timothy J. Culver&#x27;s &quot;Ex Officio&quot; works for Coe-Stark Associates.
* In the Mitch Tobin novel &quot;A Jade in Aries&quot;, Tobin phones a friend, who briefly mistakes Tobin for somebody named Don Stark.

Additionally, Westlake conducted a mock &quot;interview&quot; with Richard Stark, Tucker Coe and Timothy J. Culver in an article for the non-fiction book &quot;Murder Ink: The Mystery Reader&#x27;s Companion&quot;.

==Writing style==
Donald Westlake was known for the great ingenuity of his plots and the audacity of his gimmicks. Westlake&#x27;s most famous characters include the hard-boiled criminal Parker (appearing in fiction published under the Richard Stark pseudonym) and Parker&#x27;s comic flip-side John Dortmunder. Westlake was quoted as saying that he originally intended what became &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; to be a straightforward Parker novel, but &quot;It kept turning funny,&quot; and thus became the first John Dortmunder novel.

Most of Donald Westlake&#x27;s novels are set in New York City. In each of the Dortmunder novels, there is typically a foray into a particular city neighborhood. He wrote just two non-fiction books: &quot;Under an English Heaven&quot;, regarding the unlikely 1967 Anguillan &quot;revolution&quot;, and a biography of Elizabeth Taylor.

Westlake was an occasional contributor to science fiction fanzines such as &quot;Xero&quot;, and used &quot;Xero&quot; as a venue for a harsh announcement that he was leaving the science fiction field.

== Literary crossovers ==
Westlake and Joe Gores wrote the same encounter between two of their characters from different perspectives in two different novels. In chapter 18 of Gores&#x27; 1972 novel &quot;Dead Skip&quot;, San Francisco detective Dan Kearney meets Westlake&#x27;s amoral thief Parker while looking for one of Parker&#x27;s associates. The sequence is described from Parker&#x27;s viewpoint in the 1972 book &quot;Plunder Squad&quot;, which Westlake wrote under the pseudonym Richard Stark. Gores hints further at the connection between the two books by referring to Parker&#x27;s associates as &quot;the plunder squad.&quot; Additionally, earlier in the novel, the book&#x27;s protagonist Larry Ballard is described as being a reader only of Richard Stark novels.

Gores and Westlake also wrote a shared chapter in Westlake&#x27;s &quot;Drowned Hopes&quot; and Gores&#x27; &quot;32 Cadillacs&quot;, having the characters in those books influenced by the same event.

==Motion pictures and television==

Several of Westlake&#x27;s novels have been made into motion pictures: 1967&#x27;s &quot;Point Blank&quot; (based on &quot;The Hunter&quot;) with Lee Marvin as Parker (changed to Walker); &quot;&quot; (based on &quot;The Score&quot;) with Michel Constantin as Parker (changed to Georges), also in 1967; 1968&#x27;s &quot;The Split&quot; (from the book &quot;The Seventh&quot;) with Jim Brown as Parker (changed to McClain); &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; in 1972 with Robert Redford; &quot;Cops and Robbers&quot; in 1973; &quot;&quot;The Outfit&quot;&quot; with Robert Duvall as Parker (changed to Macklin), also in 1973; &quot;Bank Shot&quot; in 1974 with George C. Scott; &quot;The Busy Body&quot; (with an &quot;all-star cast&quot;) in 1967; &quot;Slayground&quot; with Peter Coyote as Parker (changed to Stone) in 1983; &quot;Why Me?&quot; with Christopher Lambert, Christopher Lloyd, and J. T. Walsh in 1990; &quot;Payback&quot; in 1999, the second film made from &quot;The Hunter&quot;, with Mel Gibson as Parker (changed to Porter); &quot;What&#x27;s the Worst That Could Happen?&quot; in 2001 with Martin Lawrence as Dortmunder (changed to Kevin Caffery); Constantin Costa-Gavras adapted &quot;The Ax&quot; for the European screen in 2005, to great critical and public acclaim – entitled &quot;Le Couperet&quot;, the film takes place in France and Belgium rather than the novel&#x27;s setting of New England; &quot;Parker&quot; in 2013, based on &quot;Flashfire&quot;, with Jason Statham as Parker.

In his introduction to one of the short stories in &quot;Thieves&#x27; Dozen&quot;, Westlake mentioned legal troubles with Hollywood over his continued use of the Dortmunder novel characters; the movie studios attempted to assert that he had sold the rights to the characters to them permanently as a result of the Redford film.

The novel &quot;Jimmy the Kid&quot; has been adapted three times: in Italy as &quot;&quot; in 1976; in the U.S. as &quot;Jimmy the Kid&quot; in 1982, starring Gary Coleman; and in Germany as &quot;Jimmy the Kid&quot; in 1998, starring Herbert Knaup.

The novel &quot;Two Much!&quot; has been adapted twice: in France as &quot;Le Jumeau&quot; (&quot;The Twin&quot;) in 1984; and in the U.S. as &quot;Two Much&quot; in 1995, starring Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith.

Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Made in U.S.A.&quot; in 1966 was an extremely loose adaptation of &quot;The Jugger&quot;. Neither the film&#x27;s producer nor Godard purchased the rights to the novel, so Westlake successfully sued to prevent the film&#x27;s commercial distribution in the United States.

His novel &quot;Memory&quot;, published posthumously in 2010, was adapted into the upcoming film &quot;The Actor&quot;, directed by Duke Johnson and starring André Holland and Gemma Chan.

Westlake was himself a screenwriter. His script for the 1990 film &quot;The Grifters,&quot; adapted from the novel by Jim Thompson, was nominated for an Academy Award. Westlake adapted Jim Thompson&#x27;s work in a straightforward manner, but Westlake the humourist played on Thompson&#x27;s name later that year in the Dortmunder novel &quot;Drowned Hopes&quot; by featuring a character named &quot;Tom Jimson&quot; who is a criminal psychopath. Westlake also wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;The Stepfather&quot; (from a story by Westlake, Brian Garfield and Carolyn Lefcourt), which was popular enough to inspire two sequels and a remake, projects in which Westlake was not involved.

In 1987 Westlake wrote the teleplay &quot;Fatal Confession&quot;, a pilot for the TV series &quot;Father Dowling Mysteries&quot; based on the novels by Ralph McInerny. He also appeared in a small role (as the mystery writer Rich Vincent) in the third-season episode, &quot;The Hardboiled Mystery.&quot;

Westlake wrote an early draft of the 1999 James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, which was later scrapped because of difficulties in filming in the script&#x27;s original setting in China. Westlake adapted the script into the novel &quot;Forever and a Death&quot;, which was published posthumously in 2017 by Hard Case Crime.

Westlake wrote an unproduced screenplay adapting the Dashiell Hammett crime novel &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, which changed the story considerably to refocus the ending on solving the original murder for which the detective had been hired, which is solved relatively early in the original book and which Westlake felt made the detective&#x27;s continuing involvement in the story hard to justify.

Westlake co-wrote the story for the pilot of the ill-fated 1979 TV series &quot;Supertrain&quot; with teleplay writer Earl W. Wallace; Westlake and Wallace shared &quot;created by&quot; credit.

In 2022, Variety (magazine) reported that Robert Downey, Jr. and Shane Black were working together on multiple movie and television projects for Amazon Studios based on the Parker series.

An adaptation of Westlake&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ax&quot; is currently in production by the South Korean director Park Chan-Wook under the title &quot;No Other Choice&quot;.

==Legacy==
Westlake has been acknowledged by many writers and fans of crime fiction as one of the masters of the genre.

The central villain of Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dark Half&quot;, George Stark, was named in honor of Richard Stark. King telephoned Westlake personally to ask permission. King&#x27;s own &quot;Richard Bachman&quot; pseudonym was also partly named for Stark: King had been reading a Richard Stark novel at the time he chose the pen name.

Writer Duane Swierczynski named his first-born son Parker, in honor of the Richard Stark character as well as Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity, Peter Parker.

In addition to Darwyn Cooke&#x27;s graphic-novel adaptations of Parker, Cooke also homaged Westlake in his earlier work &quot;Catwoman: Selena&#x27;s Big Score&quot; by giving one of the characters, an old flame and mentor of Selina Kyle, the name &quot;Stark&quot; as well as the face of Lee Marvin, who played the Parker character in &quot;Point Blank&quot;.

<text>Carmine John Persico Jr. (; August 8, 1933 – March 7, 2019), also known as &quot;Junior&quot;, &quot;The Snake&quot; and &quot;Immortal&quot;, was an American mobster and the longtime boss of the Colombo crime family in New York City from 1973 until his death in 2019. He had been serving 32 years in federal prison from 1987 until his death on March 7, 2019.

== Youth and crimes ==

=== Background ===
Carmine Persico was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Carmine John Persico Sr. and Assunta &quot;Susan&quot; Plantamura. His father was a legal stenographer for several law firms in Manhattan. His brothers Theodore Persico and Alphonse &quot;Allie Boy&quot; Persico (died 1989) also became caporegimes in the Colombo crime family. His son, named Alphonse after the boy&#x27;s uncle and commonly known as &quot;Little Allie Boy&quot;, eventually became a capo as well. He was the uncle of Theodore Persico Jr. The family lived in the Carroll Gardens and Red Hook sections of Brooklyn.

Persico dropped out of high school at age 16. By then he was a leader of the Garfield Boys, a Brooklyn street gang. However, one contemporary source says that in 1950 he had actually belonged to the South Brooklyn Boys, a successor gang to the Garfield Boys. In March 1951, 17-year-old Persico was arrested on charges of fatally beating another youth in Brooklyn&#x27;s Prospect Park. However, all charges were eventually dropped. In the early 1950s, Persico was recruited into the Profaci crime family, the forerunner of the Colombo family, by longtime capo Frank Abbatemarco. At first Persico did bookmaking and loan-sharking, then moved into burglaries and hijackings. During this decade he was arrested over 12 times but spent only a few days in jail. He also started working with Joe Gallo and his brothers, Albert Gallo and Larry Gallo.

=== Anastasia murder ===
In 1957, Persico allegedly participated in the murder of Albert Anastasia, the former leader of Murder, Inc. and the boss of what was then the Anastasia family. Anastasia&#x27;s underboss Carlo Gambino wanted control of the family and conspired with his allies, Genovese family boss Vito Genovese and Profaci boss Joe Profaci, to kill Anastasia. Profaci allegedly gave the job to Persico and the Gallo brothers.

On October 25, 1957, Anastasia entered the barbershop of the Park Sheraton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. As he relaxed in the barber chair, two men—with scarves covering their faces—rushed in, shoved the barber out of the way and fired at Anastasia. After the first volley of bullets, Anastasia allegedly tried to lunge at his killers. However, the stunned Anastasia had actually attacked the gunmen&#x27;s reflections in the wall mirror of the barber shop. The gunmen continued firing, finally killing Anastasia. No one was ever charged in the Anastasia killing.

== Profaci and Magliocco regimes ==

=== The Gallo faction ===
By the late 1950s, Persico and the Gallos were becoming increasingly dissatisfied with Profaci&#x27;s leadership. Profaci demanded high tribute payments from family members and was viewed as a wealthy autocrat. The First Colombo War started on November 4, 1959, when Profaci&#x27;s gunmen murdered Abbatemarco on a Brooklyn street. Abbatemarco had stopped paying tribute to Profaci earlier that year with the support of the Gallo faction. It is speculated that Carlo Gambino and Lucchese family boss Tommy Lucchese were encouraging the Gallos to challenge Profaci, their enemy. When Profaci took Abbatemarco&#x27;s lucrative rackets away from the Gallos, the warfare began.

On February 27, 1961 the Gallos, led by Joe Gallo, kidnapped four of Profaci&#x27;s top men: underboss Joseph Magliocco, Frank Profaci (Joe Profaci&#x27;s brother), capo Salvatore Musacchia and soldier John Scimone. Profaci himself eluded capture and flew to sanctuary in Florida. While holding the hostages, Larry and Albert Gallo sent Joe Gallo to California. Profaci&#x27;s Capo &amp; later underboss John ‘Sonny’ Franzese negotiated with the Gallos and all the hostages were released peacefully.

=== Changing sides ===
On August 20, 1961 Joe Profaci ordered the murder of Gallo members Joseph &quot;Joe Jelly&quot; Gioielli and Larry Gallo. Gunmen allegedly murdered Gioielli after inviting him to go deep sea fishing. Gallo survived a strangulation attempt in the Sahara club of East Flatbush by Persico and Salvatore &quot;Sally&quot; D&#x27;Ambrosio after a police officer intervened. The Gallos then began calling Persico &quot;The Snake&quot;; he had betrayed them, the war continued on resulting in nine murders and three disappearances. Persico was indicted later that year for the attempted murder of Gallo, but the charges were dropped when Gallo refused to testify.

On June 6, 1962, Profaci died of cancer and Magliocco became the new family boss. However, the war with the Gallo faction continued. In early 1963, Persico survived a car bombing and his enforcer Hugh McIntosh was shot in the groin as he attempted to kill Larry Gallo. On May 19, 1963, Gallo gunmen ambushed Persico in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn. A panel truck pulled alongside Persico&#x27;s car and two men shot him in the face, hand and shoulder. Persico reportedly spat out the bullet that had entered his face. Soon after this attempt on his life, Persico was imprisoned on extortion charges. By the fall of 1963, with Joey Gallo also imprisoned, the shooting war had ended with Magliocco the winner.

In late 1963, after an unsuccessful attempt to take over the Commission, Magliocco was forced into retirement. He was replaced by Colombo, who had alerted the Commission to Magliocco&#x27;s plot. The Profaci crime family was now the Colombo crime family. In turn, Colombo rewarded the imprisoned Persico by naming him a capo.

== Colombo regime ==

=== Profitable crew ===
After he was promoted to capo, Persico was constantly on the streets. He was involved in labor racketeering, extortion, loan-sharking, hijacking, illegal gambling, and especially murder for hire. By the late 1960s, Persico&#x27;s crew was one of the most profitable in the Colombo family. In 1968, Persico was convicted on federal hijacking charges after five separate trials dating back to 1960. On January 27, 1972, he was finally sent to prison on these charges, where he would spend eight years. The trial was noted for the only appearance of former mobster Joseph Valachi as a prosecution witness.

=== Colombo and Gallo shootings ===
In February 1971, Joey Gallo was released from prison. On June 28, Colombo was shot and severely wounded at the second annual Italian-American Civil Rights League rally in Manhattan. The shooter, a black ex-convict named Jerome Johnson, was immediately shot dead by Colombo&#x27;s bodyguards. Colombo survived in a paralyzed state until his death on May 22, 1978. Police concluded that Johnson was the sole shooter. Both law enforcement and the Mafia assumed Gallo had organized the hit; he had built ties with black gangsters while in prison and, upon his release, threatened to start another gang war unless he received $100,000 compensation.

On November 11, 1971, Persico went on trial in state court on 37 counts of extortion, usury, coercion, and conspiracy, all stemming from a loan-sharking operation out of a Manhattan fur shop. On December 8 a jury acquitted him of all charges; all 12 prosecution witnesses said they could not identify Persico.

After the Colombo shooting, underboss Joseph Yacovelli assumed the role of acting boss. On April 7, 1972, Joey Gallo was shot and killed by Persico gunmen as he was celebrating his birthday at Umberto&#x27;s Clam House in Manhattan&#x27;s Little Italy. Looking for revenge, Albert Gallo sent a gunman from Las Vegas to the Neapolitan Noodle restaurant in Manhattan, where Yacovelli, Alphonse Persico, and Gennaro Langella were dining one day. However, the gunman did not recognize the mobsters and shot four innocent diners instead, killing two of them. After this assassination attempt, Yacovelli fled New York, leaving Persico as the new boss, with Perisco himself coordinating the suppression of the Gallos.

== Persico regime ==

=== Prison ===

In 1973, Persico was imprisoned on hijacking and loan-sharking charges, and sentenced to eight years in prison. His incarceration coincided with the release of his brother Alphonse from 17 years in prison. Persico designated Alphonse as acting boss with support as underboss from Gennaro Langella and Carmine&#x27;s other brother, Theodore. Langella supervised various labor rackets for the family, including their stake in the &quot;Concrete Club&quot;, and exerted control over various labor unions, including Cement and Concrete Workers District Council, Local 6A. In 1979, Persico was released from federal prison.

On August 11, 1981, Persico pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge of attempting to bribe an IRS agent from 1977–78 while in federal custody. The evidence included a recording of Persico offering the agent $250,000 in exchange for getting him an early release from prison. On November 9, 1981, Persico was sentenced to five years in federal prison.

=== Federal fugitive ===
On October 14, 1984, Persico and the rest of the Colombo family leadership were indicted on multiple racketeering charges as part of the &quot;Colombo Trial&quot;. After the indictment was published, Persico went into hiding. On October 26, the FBI began a national manhunt for Persico, and soon named him as the 390th fugitive to be added to their Ten Most Wanted list.

Persico hid in the home of his brother-in-law and minor mob associate Fred DeChristopher, in Hempstead, New York. Unbeknownst to Persico, DeChristopher had been relaying information to the FBI for the previous two years after being caught up in a sting operation, and had already told the Bureau of Persico&#x27;s whereabouts. The FBI concocted the fake &quot;manhunt&quot; to shield DeChristopher, who would later provide damning testimony against Persico as a key witness for the prosecution. Persico was arrested on February 15, 1985 at the home of DeChristopher. An FBI agent actually called the residence and spoke with Persico, telling him the house was surrounded. Persico and another mob associate that had been visiting him surrendered peacefully. Persico, the only head of a mafia family to ever make the Ten Most Wanted list, later autographed one of the posters for an FBI agent.

On July 1, Persico pleaded not guilty along with 11 other New York Mafia leaders, after a previous indictment on a second set of racketeering charges as part of the Mafia Commission Trial. Prosecutors aimed to strike at all the crime families at once using their involvement in the commission. According to Colombo hitman and FBI informant Gregory Scarpa, Persico and Gambino boss John Gotti backed a plan to kill the lead prosecutor, and future New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani in late 1986, but it was rejected by the rest of the commission.

=== Life imprisonment ===

==== Colombo and Commission trials ====

At the start of the commission trial Persico decided to serve as his own lawyer. He believed that his history of convictions gave him sufficient experience to defend himself. His co-defendants vehemently disagreed with this decision, and the judge warned Persico that he would be waiving &quot;incompetent counsel&quot; as the grounds for an appeal. Persico received counsel from lawyers to help guide him when the prosecutors questioned him. He tried to project a friendly image to the jury and urged them to put aside any preconceptions about &quot;the Mafia&quot; or &quot;Cosa Nostra&quot;. Many believe that Persico inadvertently sabotaged his own defense by acknowledging criminal activities during his cross-examinations of prosecution witnesses.

On June 14, 1986, Persico was convicted of racketeering in the Colombo Trial. On November 17, he was sentenced to 39 years in prison. The sentencing judge, John F. Keenan, nonetheless praised Persico&#x27;s performance as his own lawyer in the commission trial and said, &quot;Mr. Persico, you&#x27;re a tragedy. You are one of the most intelligent people I have ever seen in my life.&quot; On November 19, Persico and the other commission trial defendants were convicted on all charges. On January 13, 1987, Keenan sentenced Persico to 100 years in prison, to run consecutively with his 39-year sentence in the Colombo trial, a $240,000 fine, and given no option for parole.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; organized crime writer Selwyn Raab thought the Colombos were the most damaged by the trial, even though most of the top leaders of New York&#x27;s Mafia families were sent to prison, with the Luccheses losing their entire hierarchy. In his book &quot;Five Families&quot;, Raab noted that Persico was only 53 years old at the time of the commission trial, making him by far the youngest boss in New York. However, Raab noted, Persico had already led the family for 14 years and was &quot;at the peak of his abilities.&quot; He believed Persico would have potentially had a long reign ahead of him had he not been taken off the streets. By comparison, the other bosses were in their 70s, and would have likely passed the reins to men of Persico&#x27;s generation even without the trial intervening. Persico was sent to United States Penitentiary near Marion, Illinois, to serve his combined 139-year sentence.

By 2017, Persico was in the medium-security Federal Correctional Complex in Butner, North Carolina. The facility has medical facilities for elderly inmates. Press reports indicated he had become friends with convicted fraudster Bernie Madoff.

==== Revenge ====
In June 1987, Persico ordered acting boss Joel Cacace to kill lawyer William Aronwald, a retired prosecutor who had allegedly been disrespectful to the Mafia. Cacace delegated the job to two hitmen who mistakenly killed Aronwald&#x27;s father George. In response to outrage from the other New York families, Cacace recruited two more gunmen to kill the first hit team. After those murders were accomplished, Cacace killed the second set of gunmen. In 2004, Cacace would plead guilty to the Aronwald murder. No charges were filed against Persico.

==== Brooklyn rivalry ====
Persico realized that he would likely die in prison, and would thus never be able to resume active control of the family. He was, however, determined to ensure that his cut of the Colombo rackets continued to flow to his relatives. To that end, soon after he was sentenced, he named his brother, Allie Boy, as acting boss. Allie Boy did not reign long, however; he was arrested for loansharking and averted bail. Persico then named a three-man ruling panel to run the family. In 1988, he dissolved the panel and named Victor &quot;Little Vic&quot; Orena, a loyal capo from Brooklyn, as temporary acting boss. While giving Orena the power to induct members and order murders on his own authority—unusual for an acting boss—Persico made it clear that Orena was merely a placeholder until Persico&#x27;s son, Little Allie Boy, was released from prison. Indeed, Persico picked Orena in part because he was the capo of Little Allie Boy&#x27;s old crew. Knowing that Little Allie Boy would be 40 years old by the time he was paroled, Persico wanted to ensure that his son would be able to inherit the family&#x27;s riches as soon as he was released.
In 1990, the government transferred Persico to what was then the United States Penitentiary in Lompoc, California. There he established an Italian Cultural Club for the inmates. He socialized with people such as Patriarca family consigliere Joseph Russo and Lucchese family associate Anthony Senter. Persico formed the &quot;Lompoc Four&quot;, a band in which Russo played guitar and Persico played drums.

By 1991, Orena had become disgruntled with the current leadership scheme and was tired of the constant stream of orders that he received from Persico in prison. He also grew to resent that he would have to turn over the family to Little Allie Boy. John Gotti encouraged Orena&#x27;s rebellion, since he and Persico had long been enemies, and went so far as to label Persico a &quot;rat&quot;, the worst possible accusation for a Cosa Nostra figure.

In the spring of 1991, Orena made a push to become boss in his own right. He requested that consigliere Carmine Sessa quietly poll all the Colombo capos as to whom they wanted as boss. Orena believed that if he had enough support from the capos, it would strengthen his argument that the Commission should recognize Orena, not Persico, as the rightful leader of the family. However, Sessa instead told Persico about Orena&#x27;s plot. Persico then allegedly ordered Sessa to lead a team to kill Orena. On June 20, Sessa took a five-man hit team and parked on the street close to Orena&#x27;s residence on Long Island, waiting for his return home. As Orena drove down the street, he recognized the men in the car and quickly sped away. For the next several months, the Persico and Orena factions engaged in peace negotiations brokered by the Commission. Despite Persico&#x27;s claim as the legitimate boss, the Commission refused to take sides in the Colombo conflict.

==== Third Colombo war ====
On November 18, 1991, the Third Colombo War started when Orena lieutenant William Cutolo sent a hit team to try to kill Scarpa, a Persico loyalist, in Brooklyn. By the end of 1991, the two Colombo factions had traded several successful murder attempts. Responding to public outrage over the carnage, law enforcement threw resources into prosecuting the Colombo mobsters, resulting in 68 indictments, 58 convictions and ten mobsters turning state&#x27;s evidence. In December 1992, Orena was convicted of racketeering and murder and was sentenced to life in prison, dissolving his belligerent faction and leaving the Persicos in control again.

==== Changing family structure ====
With the end of the war with Orena, Persico had to set up another ruling structure for the family. Since Little Allie Boy was facing prosecution on new charges, Persico installed a ruling committee comprising his brother, Theodore, mobster Joseph Baudanza and Joseph Tomasello. In 1994, when Andrew Russo was released from prison, Persico disbanded the committee and designated Russo as acting boss. In 1996, Russo went to prison and Persico replaced him with his son, Little Allie Boy, who by now had been released from prison. In early 1999, with Alphonse in legal trouble, Persico made Cacace the acting boss.

However, later in 1999, either Carmine or Alphonse Persico ordered Cutolo&#x27;s murder. The recently released Alphonse was facing new federal charges that threatened to send him back to prison, and the Persicos were worried about Cutolo seizing control of the family. On May 26, 1999, Alphonse ordered Cutolo to meet him at a Brooklyn park. Cutolo was then taken to a mob associate&#x27;s apartment and murdered, and his body was buried in Long Island. Police would not recover the remains until November 2008.

=== Life sentence for Alphonse Persico ===
On December 20, 2001, Alphonse Persico pleaded guilty to the loan-sharking charges, accepted a 13-year prison sentence and agreed to forfeit $1 million. On October 14, 2004, he was indicted on federal racketeering charges, including conspiring to murder Cutolo and Joe Campanella. No charges were filed against Carmine Persico. However, the Cutolo murder trial ended in a mistrial due to juror deadlock.

In 2004, with the conversion of Lompoc into a different correctional facility, the government transferred Carmine Persico to the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, a medium-security correctional facility in North Carolina.

On December 28, 2007, in a second trial, Alphonse Persico and DeRoss were convicted of Cutolo&#x27;s murder. Like his father, Alphonse Persico was sentenced to life in prison.

==== Later leadership ====
In 2011, Carmine Persico was still the official boss of the Colombo crime family. His street boss at the time was Andrew Russo, his official underboss, John Franzese, the acting underboss Benjamin Castellazzo and the consigliere Richard Fusco.

In March 2010, the Reuters News Agency reported that Carmine Persico had been socializing in prison with convicted swindler Bernard Madoff. The &quot;New York Post&quot; further reported that Persico loved to play pinochle and bocce with other mobsters and regale them with stories from his past.

Persico&#x27;s projected release date was March 20, 2050—when he would have been 117 years old. Raab wrote in &quot;Five Families&quot; that Persico&#x27;s attempts to protect his own position and ensure that his son succeeded him nearly destroyed the Colombo family. By Raab&#x27;s estimate, Persico&#x27;s &quot;deceitful schemes&quot; led directly to 70 of his fellow mobsters and associates being sent to prison, as well as 12 deaths.

==Death==
On March 7, 2019, Persico died at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.

<text>The Wilton Diptych (made ) is a small portable diptych of two hinged panels, painted on both sides, now in the National Gallery, London. It is an extremely rare survival of a late medieval religious panel painting from England. The diptych was painted for King Richard II of England, who is depicted kneeling before the Virgin and Child in what is known as a donor portrait. He is presented to them by (left to right) the English saints King Edmund the Martyr, King Edward the Confessor and patron saint, John the Baptist. The painting is an outstanding example of the International Gothic style, and the nationality of the unknown artist is probably French or English.

==Description==
The Wilton Diptych is painted on two panels of Baltic oak, set in frames of the same material and joined by two hinges so that it may be closed to protect the inner painting. The inner faces of the panels are in excellent condition for their age, though some glazes have been lost, and the outer faces have paint losses from handling.

The painting is in tempera, the ground paint being mixed with egg yolk and laid in thin glazes. The background and many details are inlaid with gold leaf and in places the panel has been tooled beneath the gilding to enhance the decorative quality. In the panel with the Virgin and Christ Child, the garments are universally blue, the pigment coming from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli. Richard&#x27;s robe uses vermilion, another expensive pigment. Some colours have faded; the roses in the angels&#x27; hair would originally have been a much deeper pink, and the green grass of the outer hart panel is now much darker than when painted.

Although the figures of the two inner scenes face each other, and interact by gaze and gesture, they are set in different backgrounds. The human figures are on bare rocky ground, with a forest behind, and a gold leaf &quot;sky&quot; decorated with a pattern made by a metal punch. The heavenly figures stand in a flowery meadow, behind which is a gold background patterned by a different punch.

In the left inner panel the kneeling King Richard II is presented by Saints John the Baptist, Edward the Confessor and Edmund the Martyr, each holding their attribute. In the right-hand panel the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child in her arms is surrounded by eleven angels, against a golden background and field of delicately coloured flowers.

Richard&#x27;s outer robe is of cloth of gold and red vermilion, the fabric decorated with his personal device of the white harts and sprigs of rosemary, the emblem of his wife Anne of Bohemia, who died in 1394. Around his neck is a gold collar with broomscods, seed-pods of &quot;Cytisus scoparius&quot;, the common broom, which is the &quot;planta genista&quot; that gave Richard&#x27;s Plantagenet dynasty its name. They were also the emblem of Charles VI of France, whose daughter he married in 1396. Richard had been given such a collar by Charles in 1393, and wearing one here may indicate a date for the work after Richard&#x27;s second marriage to the six-year-old Isabella of Valois in 1396. The livery badges worn by both Richard and the angels appear to be made in the fashionable and expensive technique of ronde bosse white enamel on gold; they are comparable to the surviving Dunstable Swan Jewel, probably given by one of Richard&#x27;s cousins in the House of Lancaster. Richard&#x27;s badge, but not those of the angels, has pearls tipping the antlers, and may perhaps be based on one of several examples recorded in his treasure roll of 1397, which had pearls and a bed of emeralds for the hind to sit on. A hart badge of Richard&#x27;s inventoried in the possession of Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy in 1435 was set with 22 pearls, two spinels, two sapphires, a ruby and a huge diamond.
Although thematically linked, the composition of the two pictures is quite different in feeling. The scene of Richard and his patrons is very sedate, but full of rich contrasts in colour and texture. The scene of the Virgin and Child is full of energetic movement created by the angels who encircle the mother and child. The predominant brilliant blue gives a precious quality, symbolising the heavenly nature of this apparition. The flowery ground also symbolises the gardens of Paradise. The strong tonal contrast of the angels&#x27; wings throw the figures into relief against the background.

When closed, the diptych reveals on one side a white hart or stag, Richard&#x27;s emblem &quot;gorged&quot; with a golden coronet around its throat and a golden chain, &quot;lodged&quot; (the heraldic term for sitting) on a grassy meadow with branches of Anne&#x27;s rosemary, with a gold &quot;sky&quot;. On the other is a coat of arms with arms associated with King Edward the Confessor impaled with the arms of the Kings of England. These arms were adopted by Richard in about 1395. The arms of Edward were a later invention, as coats of arms had not been invented in the eleventh century when he lived.

==Iconography and date==
The identity of the kneeling king is certain because he and the angels surrounding the Virgin are wearing badges with Richard&#x27;s livery, the White Hart, which also appears in the brocade of the left panel and the outside of the diptych. As Richard kneels, the Christ Child reaches towards him in benediction and also reaches towards the pennant held by an angel, and significantly placed between them. This pennant is the symbol of Richard&#x27;s kingship and of the Kingdom of England as a whole. It bears the Cross of St George, the symbol of England, and surmounting the staff is an orb on which is a tiny map of England, or Ireland, where Richard was campaigning in 1394–95. The probable sense is that the pennant has just been presented by Richard. The liveried angels, iconographically very unusual, are a strangely precise anticipation of the lines from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; of two hundred years later:
::The breath of worldly men cannot depose
::The deputy elected by the Lord:
::For every man that Bolingbroke hath press&#x27;d
::To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
::God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
::A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
::Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right. (Act III Scene 2)

It is possible that Shakespeare had seen the picture, then still in the Royal Collection.

Apparently beginning relatively harmlessly in the reign of Richard&#x27;s grandfather Edward III in a context of tournaments and courtly celebrations, by Richard&#x27;s reign livery badges had come to be seen as a social menace, and were &quot;one of the most protracted controversies of Richard&#x27;s reign&quot;, as they were used to denote the small private armies of retainers kept by lords, largely for the purpose of enforcing their lord&#x27;s will on the less powerful in his area. Though they were surely a symptom rather than a cause of both local baronial bullying and the disputes between the king and his uncles and other lords, Parliament repeatedly tried to curb the use of livery badges.
The issuing of badges by lords was attacked in the Parliament of 1384, and in 1388 they made the startling request that &quot;all liveries called badges [&quot;signes&quot;], as well of our lord the king as of other lords ... shall be abolished&quot;, because &quot;those who wear them are flown with such insolent arrogance that they do not shrink from practising with reckless effrontery various kinds of extortion in the surrounding countryside ... and it is certainly the boldness inspired by these badges that makes them unafraid to do these things&quot;. Richard offered to give up his own badges, to the delight of the House of Commons of England, but the House of Lords refused to give up theirs, and the matter was put off. In 1390 it was ordered that no one below the rank of banneret should issue badges, and no one below the rank of esquire wear them.

The issue was apparently quiet for a few years, but from 1397 Richard issued increasingly large numbers of badges to retainers who misbehaved (his &quot;Cheshire archers&quot; being especially notorious), and in the Parliament of 1399, after his deposition, several of his leading supporters were forbidden from issuing &quot;badges of signes&quot; again, and a statute was passed allowing only the king (now Henry IV) to issue badges, and only to those ranking as esquires and above, who were only to wear them in his presence. In the end it took a determined campaign by Henry VII to largely stamp out the use of livery badges by others than the king, and reduce them to things normally worn only by household servants.

All three saints who present the kneeling Richard to the Virgin and Child are believed to have been venerated by the king, as each has his own chapel in Westminster Abbey. Each saint holds the symbolic attribute by which they are recognised in art. Edmund the Martyr, who stands to the left, holds the arrow which killed him in 869, while Edward the Confessor, at the centre, holds the ring he gave to a pilgrim who transpired to be the disguised John the Evangelist. John the Baptist (right) holds his symbol, the Lamb of God.

The scene makes reference to King Richard&#x27;s birth on 6 January, the feast of Epiphany, when Christ was adored by three kings, often depicted in similar compositions to this. At this date the feast of the Baptism of Christ by John the Baptist was celebrated on the same day and the figure of John in his usual hermit&#x27;s dress, carrying a lamb, recalls the shepherds, whose visit after the birth of Christ was often combined in the same scene as the visit of the Magi or three kings. That two of the presenting saints are kings may also evoke a contemporary story that Richard&#x27;s birth in Bordeaux in France was attended by the Kings of Castile, Navarre, and Portugal. John the Baptist was Richard&#x27;s patron saint, and Saint Edward and Saint Edmund had both been English kings. Richard had a special devotion to Edmund, who with St George is one of the patron saints of England.
The diptych also serves as a family portrait of Richard&#x27;s family and immediate antecedents. There is a strong resemblance between the three saints, and it has been suggested they represent not just Saints Edmund, Edward the Confessor, and John the Baptist, but also either Edward III (Richard&#x27;s immediate predecessor) with his sons Edward the Black Prince (Richard&#x27;s father) and John of Gaunt (Richard&#x27;s uncle, and a powerful figure during Richard&#x27;s youth); or, alternatively, the Black Prince doubled with the Baptist (the Black Prince, like John the Baptist, was never a king, and the Baptist takes the most paternal role in the scene), Edward III doubled with the Confessor, and Edward III&#x27;s father Edward II doubled with Edmund the Martyr (like Edmund, Edward II was a murdered king; Richard revered Edward, and tried to have him canonised in 1395). The Virgin Mary is considered to represent Richard&#x27;s mother, Joan of Kent, and the infant Jesus to be Edward of Angoulême, Richard&#x27;s older brother who died in childhood.

The date of the Wilton Diptych has been the subject of considerable controversy among art historians. The National Gallery follow a broad current consensus in dating the painting to the last five years of Richard&#x27;s reign, but dates between 1377 and about 1413 have been proposed. Richard was born in 1367, and the portrait seems to be of a younger man than the twenty-eight-year-old he was in 1395. It has been suggested that the eleven angels each represent a year of his age at the start of his actual reign, which began in 1377, when he gave eleven of the coins called angels to &quot;Our Lady of the Pew&quot; at Westminster Abbey. The painting would then have been made more than fifteen years later to commemorate the moment. Alternatively the painting might represent Richard&#x27;s reception into heaven after his death in 1400, though given the circumstances of his deposition, who would have commissioned such a work in the next reign is unclear.

The number of angels (eleven) is unusual and has still not been satisfactorily explained. It is in contradiction with the iconography of the heavenly court of the Virgin, because in medieval iconography the number eleven has extremely negative symbolism. Considering the Biblical exegesis and medieval number symbolism, a possible interpretation of the enigmatic number of angels can be found in the Biblical motif of the second dream of young Joseph (Genesis 37:9) in which the number eleven exceptionally has a positive meaning because it implicates the celestial twelve. The sun, the moon and eleven stars that in Joseph&#x27;s dream are bowing down to him are completed by Joseph himself, who according to medieval exegesis is to be taken for a twelfth star. Having in mind the historical evidence of Richard II&#x27;s personal regal iconography of the anointed king and the documented Biblical allusions, it seems that the motif of youthful Joseph honoured in his dream by the sun, representing the Christ, the moon, representing the Virgin and eleven stars representing his brothers offers a significant parallel to the vision of the heavenly court with Jesus Christ, the Virgin and eleven angelic courtiers appearing in front of the eyes of King Richard II.

The painting is indicative of both Richard&#x27;s belief in his divine right to rule and his genuine Christian devotion. It also importantly symbolises (in the form of the Pennant), Richard II giving his kingdom into the hands of the Holy Virgin, thereby continuing a long tradition by which England was known as &quot;Our Lady&#x27;s Dowry&quot; and was thought to be specially under her protection. Another painting, now lost, showed Richard and Anne offering the Virgin an orb representing England, with the inscription &quot;This is your dowry, O Holy Virgin, wherefore, O Mary, may you rule over it&quot;.

==Authorship==
The artist, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Wilton Master&quot;, has never been identified, or associated with other panel paintings, and the closest resemblances to his style come in some illuminated manuscripts from the 1410s. At this period it was common in Northern Europe for panel paintings, still made in very small numbers, to be made by artists with a background in illumination. The date of the painting, at a time when the International Gothic style was at its most similar in several courts in Europe, makes identifying the nationality of its painter more difficult. It is possible that the painter was English, but apart from the Westminster portrait of Richard, now unlike the Diptych much overpainted, there are too few comparable works to establish in what style the recorded English painters worked.

The artist has been proposed as coming from &quot;every possible nation&quot;, but France seems the most likely, with Italy another possibility, and some art historians point to the possibility of a Bohemian artist, perhaps brought to England by Richard II&#x27;s first wife, Anne of Bohemia. The exquisite quality of the painting is thought by most art historians to indicate that the artist was probably from northern France. It shows similarities to the manuscript painting of Pol de Limbourg, but like the other surviving portrait of Richard, in Westminster Abbey, is also closely related in themes to paintings made in Prague for Anne&#x27;s father Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and her brother Wenceslas, King of the Romans.

==Provenance==
The painting was drawn and issued as a print by Wenceslaus Hollar in 1639, with a dedication to King Charles I. It was documented in 1649 in an inventory of the art collection of King Charles I who had been given it by Sir 
James Palmer, a Gentleman Usher of the Privy Chamber.
It passed to the Earls of Pembroke who kept it at Wilton House, from which it takes its name, until it was bought by the National Gallery in 1929. That it remained intact is remarkable because little religious pictorial art survived the Puritan iconoclasm that followed the execution of Charles I.

<text>Theodor Innitzer (25 December 1875 – 9 October 1955) was Archbishop of Vienna and a cardinal of the Catholic Church.

==Early life==
Innitzer was born in Neugeschrei (Nové Zvolání), part of the town Weipert (Vejprty) in Bohemia, at that time Austria-Hungary, (now Czech Republic). He was the son of a passementier Wilhelm Innitzer in Vejprty, later a textile factory worker, and his wife Maria born Seidl, daughter of a mining clerk. After completing the minimum mandatory school, Innitzer became an apprentice in a textile factory. The dean of his home parish supported young Theodor, thus paving the way for him to attend higher schools (&quot;Gymnasium&quot;) in Kaaden.

==Ecclesiastical career==

*1898 – entered the seminary in Vienna
*1902 – priestly ordination
*1906 – doctorate in theology
*1908 to 1911 Privatdozent at the University of Vienna
*1911 to 1932 professor and (from 1913) chair for New Testament Exegesis
*1928 to 1929 rector of the University of Vienna
*1929 to 1930 Minister of Social Affairs in the third government of Chancellor Johann Schober
*1932 consecrated archbishop of Vienna
*1933 name a cardinal

==Political activity and assessment==

===The &quot;Anschluss&quot;===
Innitzer&#x27;s role in early 20th century Austrian history remains disputed because of his involvement in politics. Despite early support for the Anschluss, Innitzer became a critic of National Socialism and was subject to further violent intimidation.

This assessment stems from his cooperation with the Austro-fascist government of Engelbert Dollfuß and Kurt Schuschnigg from 1934 to 1938, which based many of its economic and social policies on the teachings of the Catholic Church. He and the other Austrian Catholic bishops signed a declaration endorsing the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, set up by Gauleiter Josef Bürckel, and signed by Innitzer with &quot;Heil Hitler!&quot;. Without the bishops&#x27; consent, the Nazi regime disseminated this statement throughout the German Reich. 

Vatican Radio had recently broadcast a vehement denunciation of the Nazi action, and Cardinal Pacelli (soon to become Pope Pius XII) ordered Innitzer to report to the Vatican. Before meeting with Pius XI, Innitzer met with Pacelli, who had been outraged by Innitzer&#x27;s statement. He made it clear that Innitzer needed to retract and was made to sign a new statement, issued on behalf of all the Austrian bishops, which asserted that &quot;the solemn declaration of the Austrian bishops ... was clearly not intended to be an approval of something that was not and is not compatible with God&#x27;s law.&quot; The Vatican newspaper also reported that the bishops&#x27; earlier statement had been issued without the approval of the Holy See.

===Nazi intimidation===
In April 1938, in honour of Hitler&#x27;s birthday, Cardinal Innitzer had ordered that all Austrian churches fly the swastika flag, ring bells, and pray for Hitler. Innitzer also called a day of prayer in the Cathedral of St. Stephen of Vienna for 7 October 1938, which was attended by almost 9,000 people, mostly young people. In the sermon, Innitzer declared that &quot;we must confess our faith in our Führer, for there is just one Führer: Jesus Christ.&quot; Nazi leaders were angered: about 100 Nazis, among them many older members of the Hitler Youth, ransacked the archbishop&#x27;s residence the next day. In Britain, the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; provided the following contemporary account on 14 October 1938:

===World War II===
Innitzer&#x27;s ambiguous relationship with the Nazi regime brought him a lot of criticism after World War II (he was referred to as the &quot;Heil Hitler Cardinal&quot;). During the war, Innitzer was critical of the anti-Semitic and racist policies of the Nazis towards the Austrian Jews and the Catholic gypsies of the Austrian countryside.

He openly, though moderately, supported the war effort against the Soviet Union, however. Years before, he had campaigned against Soviet policies. In 1933, based on data collected by undercover investigation and photographs, Innitzer sought to raise awareness in the West of the Holodomor and even cases of cannibalism that were occurring in Ukraine and the North Caucasus at that time.

In October 1944, Innitzer preached in the parish of Vienna-Reindorf, which also included members of the NSDAP local group who listened and wrote a report about it. They reported that Innitzer attributed the war to God directly; he saw it as a punishment for lukewarm participation in church life: children not receiving Communion, absolution in confession, or religious instruction at school. Seminaries were closing, and only one sixth of Catholics attended Holy Mass. The report understood this as indirect criticism of the National Socialist government, since their measures had suppressed the church&#x27;s influence.

<doc id="1238967" wikidata="Q7104932" url="?curid=1238967" title="Orthostatic intolerance">
<text>Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is the development of symptoms when standing upright that are relieved when reclining. There are many types of orthostatic intolerance. OI can be a subcategory of dysautonomia, a disorder of the autonomic nervous system occurring when an individual stands up. Some animal species with orthostatic hypotension have evolved to cope with orthostatic disturbances.

A substantial overlap is seen between syndromes of orthostatic intolerance on the one hand, and either chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia on the other. It affects more women than men (female-to-male ratio is at least 4:1), usually under the age of 35. OI can also be a symptom of mitochondrial cytopathy.

Orthostatic intolerance occurs in humans because standing upright is a fundamental stressor, so requires rapid and effective circulatory and neurologic compensations to maintain blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, and consciousness. When a human stands, about 750 ml of thoracic blood are abruptly translocated downward. People who have OI lack the basic mechanisms to compensate for this deficit. Changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and cerebral blood flow that produce OI may be caused by abnormalities in the interactions between blood volume control, the cardiovascular system, the nervous system, and circulation control system.

==Signs and symptoms==
Orthostatic intolerance can be classified as acute OI and chronic OI.

===Acute orthostatic intolerance===

Patients who have acute OI usually manifest the disorder by a temporary loss of consciousness and posture, with rapid recovery (simple faints, or syncope), as well as remaining conscious during their loss of posture. This is different from a syncope caused by cardiac problems because the triggers for the fainting spell (standing, heat, emotion) and identifiable prodromal symptoms (nausea, blurred vision, headache) are known. As Dr. Julian M. Stewart, an expert in OI from New York Medical College states, &quot;Many syncopal patients have no intercurrent illness; between faints, they are well.&quot;

Symptoms:
* Altered vision (blurred vision, &quot;white outs&quot;/gray outs, black outs, double vision)
* Anxiety
* Exercise intolerance
* Fatigue
* Headache
* Heart palpitations, as the heart races to compensate for the falling blood pressure
* Hyperpnea or sensation of difficulty breathing or swallowing (see also hyperventilation syndrome)
* Lightheadedness
* Sweating
* Tremulousness
* Weakness

A classic manifestation of acute OI is a soldier who faints after standing rigidly at attention for an extended period of time.

===Chronic orthostatic intolerance===

Patients with chronic orthostatic intolerance have symptoms on most or all days. Their symptoms may include most of the symptoms of acute OI, plus:
* Nausea
* Neurocognitive deficits, such as attention problems
* Pallor
* Sensitivity to heat
* Sleep problems
* Other vasomotor symptoms

==Causes==
Symptoms of OI are triggered by:
* An upright posture for long periods (e.g. standing in line, standing in a shower, or even sitting at a desk)
* A warm environment (e.g. hot summer weather, a hot crowded room, a hot shower or bath, after exercise)
* Emotionally stressful events (seeing blood or gory scenes, being scared or anxious)
* Return from an extended stay in space, when the body is not yet readapted to gravity
* Extended bedrest
* Inadequate fluid and salt intake
* Concussion

== Diagnosis ==
Many patients go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed and either untreated or treated for other disorders. Current tests for OI (tilt table test, NASA Lean Test, adapted Autonomic Profile (aAP), autonomic assessment, and vascular integrity) can also specify and simplify treatment. Patients with dysautonomia symptoms can be referred to a cardiologist, neurologist, or even a gastroenterologist for treatment and management.

==Management==
Most patients experience an improvement of their symptoms, but for some, OI can be gravely disabling and can be progressive in nature, particularly if it is caused by an underlying condition that is deteriorating. The ways in which symptoms present themselves vary greatly from patient to patient; as a result, individualized treatment plans are necessary.

OI is treated pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically. Treatment does not cure OI; rather, it controls symptoms.

Physicians who specialize in treating OI agree that the single most important treatment is drinking more than 2 liters (8 cups) of fluids each day. A steady, large supply of water or other fluids reduces most, and for some patients all, of the major symptoms of this condition. Typically, patients fare best when they drink a glass of water no less frequently than every two hours during the day, instead of drinking a large quantity of water at a single point in the day.

For most severe cases and some milder cases, a combination of medications is used. Individual responses to different medications vary widely, and a drug that dramatically improves one patient&#x27;s symptoms may make another patient&#x27;s symptoms much worse. Medications focus on three main issues:

&quot;Medications that increase blood volume:&quot;
* Fludrocortisone (Florinef)
* Erythropoietin
* Hormonal contraception

&quot;Medications that inhibit acetylcholinesterase:&quot;
* Pyridostigmine

&quot;Medications that improve vasoconstriction:&quot;
* Stimulants: (e.g., Ritalin or Dexedrine)
* Midodrine (ProAmatine)
* Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine (Sudafed)
* Theophylline (low-dose)
* Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs - Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil)

&quot;Behavioral changes that patients with OI can make are:&quot;
* Avoiding triggers such as prolonged sitting, quiet standing, warm environments, or vasodilating medications
* Using postural maneuvers and pressure garments
* Treating co-existing medical conditions
* Increasing fluid and salt intake
* Physical therapy and exercise

==Notable case==
A notable person with OI is Greg Page, founding member and original lead singer of the Australian children&#x27;s music group The Wiggles. Due to being diagnosed with this illness, Page left the group in late 2006, and was replaced by his understudy, Sam Moran. Two years later in late 2008, he went on to create his own fund for OI to help fund research into this then-little known disorder. Page recovered enough to temporarily return to The Wiggles in early 2012 to help with the transition to the next generation of Wiggles, after which he again left the group at the end of 2012 and was replaced by Emma Watkins and again by Tsehay Hawkins.

<doc id="1238972" wikidata="Q2654063" url="?curid=1238972" title="New Communist Party of the Netherlands">
<text>The New Communist Party of the Netherlands (, NCPN) is a communist party in the Netherlands. The NCPN was founded in 1992 by the former members of the Communist Party of the Netherlands to oppose CPN&#x27;s merger into the left-wing GroenLinks. These members have been known as &quot;the Horizontals&quot;. Through the &quot;Stichting HOC&quot; (Foundation HOC), the NCPN releases the monthly newspaper &quot;Manifest&quot;.

The NCPN actively supports the socialist government of Cuba. The party opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and is against Dutch military intervention through NATO or other military alliances. The party considers itself anti-capitalist, anti-fascist and anti-imperialist. It opposes both the active intervention of the EU and NATO in Ukraine but also the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. It believes that a Leninist view of anti-imperialism is not choosing sides in a inter-imperialist conflict. 

The NCPN claims to work to preserve the heritage of the Dutch communist movement through commemoration of events like the February strike, holding that anti-communist laws in Europe and the normalisation of far-right ideas are erasing this legacy. The party also participates in the struggle against discrimination towards women and minorities with a migrant background, and is against homophobia and transphobia.

Although the party only has limited electoral successes to date, it claims not to shun elections and instead purports to work with trade unions and other similar organisations to advance its agenda. According to a party report, &quot;the NCPN participates in elections to the best of its ability&quot; and views &quot;bourgeois representative bodies&quot; as platforms to promote its agenda.

In 2003, the Communist Youth Movement (CJB) was founded as the NCPN&#x27;s political youth organization. According to a statement from the NCPN after its 7th conference, the CJB contributed to a revival of the party in terms of membership and lowered the average age of its members.

== History ==
In 1982, a group of members of the Communist Party of the Netherlands founded the newspaper &quot;Manifest&quot;, out of discontent with the CPN leadership. In 1984 this group founded the League of Communists in the Netherlands (VCN). The CPN dissolved in 1992 in order to make place for a new political party, GreenLeft, an alliance in which the CPN had participated since the 1980s. Subsequently, the VCN, together with many former members of the CPN, founded the NCPN.

In 1999, the local branch of the NCPN in the municipality of Scheemda split from the party and continued as the United Communist Party (VCP), which has since won city council seats in Oldambt and Pekela.

== Elections ==
The NCPN has participated in elections to the Tweede Kamer, Provinciale Staten and gemeenteraden, but never in elections to the European Parliament. In the period between 1994 and 2002, the NCPN was part of the governing majority coalition in the municipality of Reiderland. 


== International activity ==
The NCPN has participated in the annual International Communist Seminar and the annual International Meeting of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties. The NCPN also often cooperates with fraternal parties like the Communist Party of Greece, Communist Party of Turkey, Communist Party of Cuba, Communist Party of Belgium, German Communist Party and the Communist Party of Luxembourg.

<text>Kalpakkam is a township in Tamil Nadu, India, situated on the Coromandel Coast 70 kilometres south of Chennai. A conglomerate of two villages (Puduppattinam and Sadurangappatinam) and a DAE township, it is about from Thiruvanmiyur and from Pondicherry. This coastal town is humid. Summers here prevail from early March till
late May. Temperatures in the Summer vary from 32 degrees Celsius and can go up to 41 degrees Celsius. There is no particular Monsoon season for Kalpakkam as rains are unpredictable here, although there is heavy rainfall in the months of October and November, usually turning into a storm. The coolest months are December and January. A study by the Madras Atomic Power Station(MAPS) revealed that the pollution in Kalpakkam is very low, which when compared to the neighbouring city Chennai is 50 times less.
Kalpakkam is known for its nuclear plants and affiliated research installations. These include the Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS), a nuclear power plant, the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), an affiliate of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). Kalpakkam hosts the only nuclear plant in India with a Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) and a Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR).

Due to increasing congestion in Kalpakkam arising from the need to accommodate more employees, a new township of Anupuram/Amaipakkam, from Kalpakkam, was inaugurated in 1998.

On December 26, 2004, the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake generated widespread damage and resulted in 200 deaths in and around Kalpakkam. There is a tsunami memorial having a white oval plaque engraved with the names of 39 people who lost their lives in the tsunami.

==Facilities==
Kalpakkam is a well built and planned township. The schools present in the township are Atomic Energy Central School (AECS 1 and 2), Kendriya Vidyalaya-1, Kendriya Vidyalaya-2, Govt Hr. Secondary School and Infant Jesus Matric Hr. Sec. School on Pudupattinam. The township is split into two sides: the Sadras and Pudupattinam sides. Both sides have similar facilities and also good facilities for sports, but Pudupattinam has larger and more complete facilities, such as the hospital and the General Services Organization (GSO). The two sides are separated by two bridges over the canal which joins the sea nearby and well over the backwater. The backwater is a visiting place by many migratory birds especially the rarely seen Siberian crane in the depths of winter. The backwater can be clearly seen through the compound walls of K.V-2 in Sadras.

==Recreation==

Until a few years ago, the beach at Kalpakkam used to be lined with casuarina trees and only a few weeds. Nowadays, to avoid the widespread damage in case of a tsunami again, weed growth is starting to dominate, which the locals are fighting to keep in check. A tsunami wall has been built across the seashore in case of another tsunami. The relatively calm waters are free of sharks.

Kalpakkam is also very close to Mamallapuram, a tourist destination near Chennai. The environment within the township has been maintained for over 30 years. The township contains numerous trees and various parks, and recreation facilities, including tennis courts, music, dance, swimming academies and other sport activities.

==NESCO==

NESCO (Nuclear Employee Sports and Cultural Organisation), previously KRC (Kalpakkam Recreation Centre) is governed by an elected employee council. It offers various facilities for members: Swimming, Movies, Basketball, Volleyball, Football, Badminton, Carrom, Chess, Table Tennis and a Gym. There is also a tennis court and Swimming pool where competitions are held annually.

==Bus routes==
The township is well connected by road and TNSTC operates buses from Chennai, Pondicherry, Bangalore, Coimbatore, Trichy, Nagercoil, Tirupathi, Vellore, Tiruvannamalai Chittoor, Tindivanam and Kanchipuram. The East Coast Road connecting Chennai and Pondicherry passes through Pudupattinam.

<doc id="1238988" wikidata="Q3854590" url="?curid=1238988" title="Men into Space">
<text>Men into Space (a.k.a. Space Challenge in later US syndication) is an American black-and-white science fiction television series, produced by Ziv Television Programs, Inc., that was first broadcast by CBS from September 30, 1959, to September 7, 1960. The series depicts future efforts by the United States Air Force to explore and develop outer space. The series&#x27; star, William Lundigan, played Col. Edward McCauley.

==Scenarios==
&quot;Men into Space&quot; was not set in a specified time period, but clues dropped in the scripts indicated that it took place between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s. The first Moon landing would have occurred circa 1975. Some props were futuristic (such as a forerunner of today&#x27;s real-life LCD TVs), but the show&#x27;s Earth clothing and environs, including automobiles, telephones, and other machines, were decidedly late 1950s. The program aired in the year just prior to the beginning of human spaceflight, with Vostok 1 and the Project Mercury launching crewed spacecraft in 1961.

&quot;Men into Space&quot; was somewhat unusual for a TV action series in that it had numerous recurring characters, but only one protagonist, Col. Edward McCauley (William Lundigan), who was in all 38 of the series&#x27; episodes. Tyler McVey appeared in seven episodes as Major General Norgath. Ron Foster appeared five times as Lieutenant Neil Templeton. Joyce Taylor had a recurring role in eight episodes as Col. McCauley&#x27;s wife, Mary McCauley.

McCauley was a sort of &quot;everyman&quot; character who was viewed in the show as the most experienced and illustrious astronaut. As depicted in the scripts, the low-key but decisive McCauley was ubiquitous, assigned to every important space mission over at least a decade, including the earliest human flights, the first flight to the Moon, many additional lunar landings and Moon base construction missions, construction of a space station, and two flights to Mars (neither succeeded, and folklore has it that plans for a never-aired second season would have focused on further missions to Mars and beyond).

In many episodes, the astronauts were faced with accidents or technical problems that required innovation. The program was not idealistic; missions sometimes failed and astronauts sometimes died. For example, a scientist-astronaut stricken with a coronary thrombosis while exploring the Moon was not expected to survive the G-forces of the return flight, so his comrades stowed the space-suited patient in a steel drum filled with water, to cushion him during launch. A &quot;Space Race&quot; episode involved spacecraft from the USA and the USSR starting out almost simultaneously on the first Mars mission, with the American spacecraft aborting its effort in order to rescue the Soviet crew after their spacecraft experienced problems.

The series included an episode whose plot essentially paralleled the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission&#x27;s explosion in space more than a decade later and another that was an uncanny foretelling of the accident that befell the real Gemini 8 mission in 1966.

Scripts often considered the human factor, and while action was the show&#x27;s forte, humor and romance were part of the mix. &quot;Men into Space&quot; predicted women astronauts and scientists, as well as married couples in space.

==Episode list==
==Artwork==
&quot;Men into Space&quot; was advertised as being (for its era) an extremely accurate preview of human spaceflight, based on scientific studies and buttressed by technical assistance from the USAF&#x27;s ballistic missile and space medicine offices. The spacecraft designs, however, veered inconsistently between early 1950s Wernher von Braun concept vehicles, and later on, totally scaled-down and more practical spacecraft proposals. Visual backdrops and conceptual designs of spacecraft, space stations, and a Moon base depended somewhat on contributions from notable astronomical and science fiction artist Chesley Bonestell.

The series also utilized extensive documentary footage of early missile launches, notably the Atlas missile. It evoked the earlier Disney space exploration documentaries, which in turn owed their look and feel to a widely read, early 1950s series on the subject in the old &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; magazine, where Bonestell&#x27;s art also held sway. At one point in production, a scale model and poster of an Atlas-derived missile design was built with the series spacecraft as its payload, with publicity photos of Lundigen holding the model in front of the large poster. Several scenes used documentary footage from the canceled Navaho missile program to depict spacecraft landings on the desert runway. The distinctive design of the North American X-10 (different from the close up depictions of the series spacecraft) can be seen in the desert landing sequences.

==Prediction of later technologies==
&quot;Men into Space&quot; used for its plots many technical and human problems anticipated by engineers and planners. For example, the show depicted attempts to refuel spacecraft by tanker in orbit, construction of a space telescope, an experiment to dispose of high level atomic waste by launching it into the Sun, the search for life-sustaining frozen Lunar water, and exploration and destruction of an asteroid whose orbit threatened Earth. In two different episodes, the series even speculated about exo-fossil extraterrestrial life discovered while exploring a distant asteroid and about ancient Earth-orbiting spaceship debris belonging to a non-human, space-faring civilization. Although the series was modestly budgeted, it was cleverly mounted with what, for its era, were very good special effects helmed by Louis DeWitt. Even decades later, the series can still be watched and appreciated for its attention to detail and accurate physics.

== Scientific accuracy ==
A narrator explained in nearly every episode why the astronauts needed magnetic boots to walk in or upon their free-falling spacecraft, how a jet thruster backpack could propel an astronaut through the vacuum of space, why a wrong angle of attack could doom a spacecraft upon atmospheric re-entry, and so forth. The spacecraft in the program were shown gliding to a powerless landing on a dry lake bed, just like the real Space Shuttle nearly 25 years later. Footage of these landings used documentary film of the SM-64 Navaho cruise missile landing at Edwards AFB.

On the other hand, dramatic license held sway on soundtracks, which repeatedly depicted sound in the airless vacuum of space: airlocks hummed, rockets roared, explosions boomed, and footsteps on the Moon&#x27;s surface could be heard. Spacesuits being worn by the actors did not expand when exposed to the vacuum of space, as they would later during actual space walks.

== Production notes ==
The program was produced by Ziv Television Programs, Inc., whose other notable series included &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;. The theme and recurring background music were written and conducted by David Rose. The series was produced by Lewis J. Rachmil.

Among the guest stars was Keith Larsen of the CBS series &quot;Brave Eagle&quot; and &quot;The Aquanauts&quot;. Joyce Taylor played the role of Mary McCauley in the series, but Angie Dickinson played the role in the original pilot episode. Other guest stars include James Best, Whit Bissell, Paul Burke, James Coburn, Paul Comi, James Drury, Joe Flynn, Arthur Franz, Nancy Gates, Allison Hayes, Murray Hamilton, Brett King, Werner Klemperer, Gavin MacLeod, Joe Maross, Donald May, Bek Nelson, Simon Oakland, Denver Pyle, Robert Reed, William Schallert, Warren Stevens, Marshall Thompson, Harry Townes, and Robert Vaughn.

Spacesuit costumes and special-effects footage of space vehicles (shot with miniature models) were later re-used in &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, the science fiction film &quot;The Phantom Planet&quot;, and the 1969 drama &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (the space opera playing on the movie screen during Joe Buck&#x27;s tryst with a bespeckled young man is footage from Men into Space episode 1). The spacesuits also bore a strong resemblance to the spacesuits worn in the first half of the one-season comedy series &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;. The pilot episode used real, high-altitude pressure suits developed by the United States Navy, but most of the space suits used in the series were US Air Force designs.

In the UK, &quot;Men into Space&quot; was shown on the BBC as a children&#x27;s series. It was programmed in an early Saturday evening slot that would later be filled by &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Novelization==
A paperback novelization of the TV series, written by science fiction writer Murray Leinster, was published in 1960.

==In popular culture==
In the early 1960s, Ideal Toy Company manufactured and sold a toy space helmet styled after the one worn by the main character, Col. Edward McCauley.

<doc id="1238994" wikidata="Q1493559" url="?curid=1238994" title="Gangway (band)">
<text>Gangway is a Danish band, originally active from 1982 to 1998 and again since 2017. Gangway consisted of Allan Jensen (lead singer), Henrik Balling (guitar), Torben Johansen (of Escape Artists, keyboards), and four different drummers, Jan Christensen (1982–84), Gorm Ravn-Jonsen (1984–89), Cai Bojsen-Møller (1991–94), and Jeppe Moesgaard (1996–98).

==Original career==
Their first three albums had a Beatles (and sometimes Smiths-esque) guitar pop sound, with a distinct new wave twist, but later on, particularly on &quot;The Quiet Boy Ate the Whole Cake&quot;, their influences were more on synthpop, such as that of the Pet Shop Boys. They are also known for their strange and subtle lyrics that are often on the verge of surrealism.

Their best-known song, &quot;My Girl and Me&quot;, was a big hit in Denmark in 1988 and was also played on MTV. It received regular airplay on the modern rock radio station KITS in San Francisco.

The band broke up in 1998, bar a one-off reunion show in October 2006.

==2017 reunion==
In spring of 2017, Gangway announced a reunion tour. Beginning in October, they played two sold out gigs at DR Koncerthuset. The shows received great critical acclaim and were followed by two more shows in Danish cities Aarhus and Aalborg. The line-up for these shows was Henrik Balling, Allan Jensen and Torben Johansen backed by drummer Janus Nevel Ringsted (formerly of Spleen United), keyboard player René Munk Thalund (of Nephew) and bass player Carl-Erik Riestra. During the shows Gorm Ravn-Jonsen made a special appearance.

In 2018 the band released their first new recordings since the 1990s with the single &quot;Colourful Combinations&quot;. The following year, they released an album, &quot;Whatever It Is&quot;, their first for 23 years.

<text>Martti Olavi Talvela (4 February 1935 – 23 July 1989) was a Finnish operatic bass.

Born in Hiitola, Finland (now in the Republic of Karelia), the eighth of ten children he studied in Lahti and Stockholm, and made his operatic debut in Helsinki in 1960 as Sparafucile. He trained as a boxer in his youth and developed the stamina necessary for the biggest roles.

Originally Talvela was educated as a primary school teacher in Savonlinna, Eastern Finland (1952–1956), and he worked in that occupation at three schools (1957–1960). He sang at the Stockholm Royal Opera in Sweden from 1961 to 1962, before becoming a regularly employed singer at the Deutsche Oper of Berlin in 1962, the same year as his debut at Bayreuth.

In 1970, the Senate (government) of West Berlin formally granted him the rank of &quot;Kammersänger&quot;. He was especially acclaimed as the title character in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, a role he performed 39 times at the Metropolitan Opera between 1974 and 1987, and as Pimen from the same work, as Paavo Ruotsalainen in &quot;The Last Temptations&quot;, as a Wagner singer who frequently performed at Bayreuth (King Marke, Hunding, Fasolt, Fafner, Hagen (one critic described his Hagen as an &quot;elemental force&quot;) and Titurel), as the Commendatore, Sarastro, Dosefei, and Prince Gremin, as King Phillip II, the Grand Inquisitor and, in the later part of his career, the title character in Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot;.

As his final record he left, terribly thinned out by illness, a warm and heartfelt version of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot;. He left at least two recorded performances of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Songs and Dances of Death&quot; – one with full orchestra and one with piano accompaniment.
In his prime Talvela made a shattering impact not only on the opera stage but also as an ardent interpreter of Lieder. After a recital given by Talvela and Ralf Gothoni in London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall in July 1974 (which included Brahms&#x27; Vier Ernste Gesänge), a critic with the Financial Times likened Talvela&#x27;s appearance to an Old Testament prophet and his voice to granite, describing how this Finnish bass giant captivated his audience with thunderstorms, prayers and invocations.
Referring to the same recital, the respected critic John Steane wrote, &quot;For at least one member of the audience on that occasion the great and irreplaceable feature of the recital was the sheer magnificence of voice.&quot;

Talvela possessed a &quot;voice of immense size and wide range&quot; and was able to bring to his roles a combination of both &quot;grandeur and gentleness&quot;. A large man, tall and weighing nearly , he was a fine vocal actor who brought an air of dignity to his roles, even to pure-evil roles like Hagen and the Grand Inquisitor.

He can be seen performing on video as Boris Godunov, as Sarastro, as Osmin, as the Grand Inquisitor (in German) and as Don Fernando, and in the CBS special &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Birthday: A Celebration in Vienna&quot;, released on DVD as &quot;Bernstein on Beethoven: A Celebration in Vienna&quot;.

Talvela was the first artistic leader of the Savonlinna Opera Festival in Finland, from 1972 to 1979, and had been appointed general director of the National Opera in Helsinki just before his death.

In 1973 he received the Pro Finlandia Medal of the Order of the Lion of Finland.

During the last eight years of his life (1981–1989), he worked as a farmer on the Inkilänhovi (Inkilä manor) farm in Juva, Eastern Finland, while continuing his official career as an opera singer. His health had begun to decline in 1975, when he was diagnosed with diabetes and gout. In 1982 alone, he suffered two heart attacks at the Metropolitan Opera. Stomach problems also plagued him at times in the 1980s.

==Death==
Talvela died of a heart attack at age 54 while dancing at his daughter&#x27;s wedding in Juva.

<doc id="1238998" wikidata="Q715749" url="?curid=1238998" title="Muhammad al-Nasir">
<text>Muhammad al-Nasir (,&quot; Muḥammad an-Nāṣir&quot;, – 1213) was the fourth Almohad Caliph from 1199 until his death. Contemporary Christians referred to him as Miramamolín.

On 25 January 1199, al-Nasir&#x27;s father Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur died; al-Nasir was proclaimed the new Caliph that very day. Al-Nasir inherited from his father an empire that was showing signs of instability. Because of his father&#x27;s victories against the Christians in the Iberian Peninsula (Al-Andalus), he was temporarily relieved from serious threats on that front and able to concentrate on combating and defeating Banu Ghaniya attempts to seize Ifriqiya (Tunisia). Needing, after this, to deal with problems elsewhere in the empire, he appointed Abu Mohammed ibn Abi Hafs as the governor of Ifriqiya, so unwittingly inaugurating the rule of the Hafsid dynasty there, which lasted until 1574.

==Dynasty and Iberian presence==
He now had to turn his attention back to Iberia, to deal with a Crusade proclaimed by Pope Innocent III at the request of King Alfonso VIII of Castile. This resulted in his defeat by a Christian coalition at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212). He died the following year, and was succeeded by his young son Yusuf al-Mustansir, born of Christian slave Qamar.

==Relationship with King John of England==
In the early 13th century, John, King of England was under pressure after a quarrel with Pope Innocent III led to England being placed under an interdict, by which all forms of worship and other religious practices were banned. John himself was excommunicated, parts of the country were in revolt and there were threats of a French invasion.

Writing two decades after the events, Matthew Paris, a St Albans chronicler of the early thirteenth century, claims that, in desperation, John sent envoys to al-Nâsir asking for his help. In return John offered to convert to Islam, to make the country at disposal of the caliph and turn England into a Muslim state. Among the delegates was Master Robert, a London cleric. Al-Nâsir was said to be so disgusted by John&#x27;s grovelling plea that he sent the envoys away. Historians have cast doubt on this story, due to the lack of other contemporary evidence.

<text>The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) is a nuclear power plant undergoing decommissioning. ChNPP is located near the abandoned city of Pripyat in northern Ukraine, northwest of the city of Chernobyl, from the Belarus–Ukraine border, and about north of Kyiv. The plant was cooled by an engineered pond, fed by the Pripyat River about northwest from its juncture with the Dnieper River.

Originally named the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant of [[Vladimir Lenin|V. I. Lenin]], the plant was commissioned in phases with the four reactors entering commercial operation between 1978 and 1984. In 1986, in what became known as the Chernobyl disaster, reactor No. 4 suffered a catastrophic explosion and meltdown; as a result of this, the power plant is now within a large restricted area known as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Both the zone and the power plant are administered by the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management. The three other reactors remained operational post-accident maintaining a capacity factor between 60 and 70%. In total, units 1 and 3 had supplied 98 terawatt-hours of electricity each, with unit 2 slightly less at 75 TWh. In 1991, unit 2 was placed into a permanent shutdown state by the plant&#x27;s operator due to complications resulting from a turbine fire. This was followed by Unit 1 in 1996 and Unit 3 in 2000. Their closures were largely attributed to foreign pressures. In 2013, the plant&#x27;s operator announced that units 1–3 were fully defueled, and in 2015 entered the decommissioning phase, during which equipment contaminated during the operational period of the power station will be removed. This process is expected to take until 2065 according to the plant&#x27;s operator. Although the reactors have all ceased generation, Chernobyl maintains a large workforce as the ongoing decommissioning process requires constant management.

From 24 February to 31 March 2022, Russian troops occupied the plant as part of their invasion of Ukraine.

== Construction ==
Construction of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant began in 1972. The plant was meant to have 12 units, made up of six construction phases, and if completed would have been the largest nuclear power plant in the world. The plant would eventually consist of four RBMK-1000 reactors, each capable of producing 1,000 megawatts (MW) of electric power (3,200 MW of thermal power), and the four together produced about 10% of Ukraine&#x27;s electricity. Like other sites which housed multiple RBMK reactors such as Kursk, the construction of the plant was also accompanied by the construction of a nearby city to house workers and their families. In the case of the ChNPP, the new city was Pripyat. Construction of the station concluded in the late 1970s, with reactor No. 1 being commissioned in 1977. It was the third Soviet RBMK nuclear power plant, after the Leningrad and Kursk power plants, and the first plant on Ukrainian soil.

The completion of the first reactor in 1977 was followed by reactor No. 2 in 1978, No. 3 in 1981, and No. 4 in 1983. Two more blocks, numbered five and six, of more or less the same reactor design, were planned at a site roughly a kilometre from the contiguous buildings of the four older blocks. This is similar to the layout of units 5 and 6 at Kursk and shows the similarity in design between the RBMK sites. Reactor No. 5 was around 70% complete at the time of Reactor 4&#x27;s explosion and was scheduled to come online approximately seven months later, in November 1986. In the aftermath of the disaster, construction on No. 5 and 6 was suspended, and eventually cancelled on April 20, 1989, days before the third anniversary of the 1986 explosion. At one point six other reactors were planned on the other side of the river, bringing the total to twelve.

Reactors No. 3 and 4 were second-generation units, whereas No. 1 and 2 were first-generation units, like those in operation at the Kursk power plant. Second-generation RBMK designs were fitted with a more secure containment structure, visible in photos of the facility.

== Design ==
=== Electrical systems ===
The power plant is connected to the 330 kV and 750 kV electrical grid. The block has two electrical generators connected to the 750 kV grid by a single generator transformer. The generators are connected to their common transformer by two switches in series. Between them, the unit transformers are connected to supply power to the power plant&#x27;s own systems; each generator can therefore be connected to the unit transformer to power the plant, or to the unit transformer and the generator transformer to also feed power to the grid.

The 330 kV line was normally not used, and served as an external power supply, connected to a station&#x27;s transformer – meaning to the power plant&#x27;s electrical systems. The plant was powered by its own generators, or at any event got power from the 750 kV national grid through the main grid backup feed in the transformer, or from the 330 kV level feed in grid transformer 2, or from the other power plant blocks via two reserve busbars. In case of total external power loss, the essential systems could be powered by diesel generators. Each unit&#x27;s transformer is therefore connected to two 6 kV main power line switchboards, A and B (e.g., 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B for generators 7 and 8), powering principal essential systems and connected to even another transformer at 4 kV, which is backed up twice (4 kV reserve busbar).

The 7A, 7B, and 8B boards are also connected to the three essential power lines (for the coolant pumps), each also having its own diesel generator. In case of a coolant circuit failure with simultaneous loss of external power, the essential power can be supplied by spinning down turbogenerators for about 45 to 50 seconds, during which time the diesel generators should start. The generators were started automatically within 15 seconds at loss of off-site power.

=== Turbo generators ===

Electrical energy was generated by a pair of 2x500 MW hydrogen-cooled turbo generators per unit. These are located in the -long machine hall, adjacent to the reactor building. The turbines—the venerable five-cylinder K-500-65/3000—were supplied by the Kharkiv turbine plant; the electrical generators are the TBB-500. The turbine and the generator rotors are mounted on the same shaft; the combined weight of the rotors is almost and their speed was 3,000 revolutions per minute.

The turbo generator is long and its total weight is . The coolant flow for each turbine is 82,880 t/h. The generator produced 20 kV 50 Hz AC power. The generator&#x27;s stator was cooled by water while its rotor was cooled by hydrogen. The hydrogen for the generators was manufactured on-site by electrolysis. The design and reliability of the turbines earned them the State Prize of Ukraine for 1979.

The Kharkiv turbine plant later developed a new version of the turbine, K-500-65/3000-2, in an attempt to reduce use of valuable metal. The Chernobyl plant was equipped with both types of turbines; block 4 had the newer ones. The newer turbines, however, turned out to be more sensitive to their operating parameters, and their bearings had frequent problems with vibrations.

=== Reactor fleet ===

The construction of two partially completed reactors, No. 5 and 6, were suspended immediately after the accident at reactor No. 4, and eventually cancelled in 1989. Reactors No. 1 and 3 continued to operate after the disaster. Reactor No. 2 was permanently shut down in 1991 after a fire broke out due to a faulty switch in a turbine. Reactors No. 1 and 3 were to be eventually closed due to a 1995 agreement Ukraine made with the European Union.

Ukraine agreed to close the remaining units in exchange for EU assistance in modernizing the shelter over reactor No. 4 and improving the energy sector of the country, including the completion of two new nuclear reactors, Khmelnytskyi 2 and Rivne 4. Reactor No. 1 was shut down in 1996 with No. 3 following in 2000.

=== Computer systems ===
SKALA (Russian: СКАЛА, система контроля аппарата Ленинградской Атомной; &quot;sistema kontrolya apparata Leningradskoj Atomnoj&quot;, &quot;Control system of the device of the Leningrad Nuclear [Power Plant]&quot;, lit. &quot;rock&quot;) was the process computer for the RBMK nuclear reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant prior to October 1995. Dating to the 1960s, it used magnetic-core memory, magnetic tape data storage, and punched tape for loading software.

SKALA monitored and recorded reactor conditions and control board inputs. It was wired to accept 7200 analog signals and 6500 digital signals. The system continuously monitored the plant and displayed this information to operators. Additionally, a program called PRIZMA (Russian: ПРИЗМА, программа измерения мощности аппарата; &quot;programma izmereniya moshchnosti apparata&quot;, &quot;Device power measurement program&quot;, lit. &quot;prism&quot;) processed plant conditions and made recommendations to guide plant operators. This program took 5 to 10 minutes to run, and could not directly control the reactor.

== Known accidents and incidents ==
=== 1982 reactor #1 partial meltdown ===
On 9 September 1982, a partial core meltdown occurred in reactor No. 1 due to a faulty cooling valve remaining closed following maintenance. Once the reactor came online, the uranium in the channel 13-44 overheated and ruptured. The extent of the damage was comparatively minor, and no one was killed during the accident. However, due to the negligence of the operators, the accident was not noticed until several hours later, resulting in significant release of radiation in the form of fragments of uranium oxide and several other radioactive isotopes escaping with steam from the reactor via the ventilation stack. This accident was somewhat similar to the 1975 Leningrad unit 1 accident. The accident was not made public until several years later, despite cleanups taking place in and around the power station and Pripyat. The reactor was repaired and put back into operation after eight months.

=== 1984 reactor #3 and #4 incident ===
According to KGB documents declassified in Ukraine on 26 April 2021, serious incidents occurred in the third and fourth reactors in 1984. According to these documents, the central government in Moscow knew as early as 1983 that the powerplant was &quot;one of the most dangerous nuclear powerplants in the USSR&quot;. The reasoning behind this had to do with the building&#x27;s structural integrity. The room which housed the steam separators would reach temperatures as high as 270 degrees Celsius. This excess heat caused the concrete of the building to shift its position, which made the building unsafe and could potentially result in the collapse of the steam separators, which would cause it to collapse onto the reactor hall, causing a meltdown.

=== 1986 reactor #4 catastrophe (Chernobyl disaster) ===

On 26 April 1986, reactor No. 4 suffered catastrophic meltdown resulting in a core explosion and open-air fires. This caused large quantities of radioactive materials to be dispersed in the atmosphere and surrounding land. The disaster is regarded as the worst accident in the history of nuclear power.

The destroyed reactor was encased in a concrete and lead sarcophagus, followed more recently by a large steel confinement shelter to prevent further escape of radioactivity. The radioactive cloud spread as far away as Norway.

=== 1991 reactor #2 turbine fire ===

Reactor No. 2 was permanently shut down shortly after October 1991 when a fire broke out due to a faulty switch in a turbine.

On 11 October 1991, a fire broke out in the turbine hall of reactor No. 2. The fire began in reactor No. 2&#x27;s fourth turbine, while the turbine was being idled for repairs. A faulty switch caused a surge of current to the generator, igniting insulating material on some electrical wiring. This subsequently led to hydrogen, used as a coolant in the synchronous generator, being leaked into the turbine hall &quot;which apparently created the conditions for fire to start in the roof and for one of the trusses supporting the roof to collapse.&quot; The adjacent reactor hall and reactor were unaffected, but due to the political climate it was decided to shut down this reactor permanently after this incident.

=== 2017 cyberattack ===
The 2017 Petya cyberattack affected the radiation monitoring system and took down the power plant&#x27;s official website, which hosts information about the incident and the area.

=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was the site of fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces during the Battle of Chernobyl as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 24 February 2022, Russian forces captured the plant. The resulting activity reportedly led to a 20-fold increase of detected radiation levels in the area due to disturbance of contaminated soil.

On 9 March 2022, there was a power cut at the plant itself. No radiation leaks were reported at the time. However, Ukrainian authorities reported that there was a risk of a radiation leak due to spent fuel coolant being unable to circulate properly.

On 31 March 2022, Russian forces formally handed control of the plant back to its employees, and most occupying forces withdrew. Ukrainian National Guard personnel were moved to Belarus as prisoners of war. On 2 April 2022, Ukrainian media reported that the flag of Ukraine was raised at the plant.

Russian troops dug trenches and other fighting positions on the outskirts of the highly contaminated Red Forest, which attracted considerable media attention due to unconfirmed reports that soldiers were being treated for radiation sickness in Belarus. The IAEA later clarified that only modest radiation doses (6.5 mSv/year) could have resulted from such activities, and a tour guide in the Zone later acknowledged to the Washington Post that he had helped start these rumors in a &quot;huge exaggeration.&quot; 

On 14 February 2025, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that a Russian drone attack significantly damaged the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement, which covers the sarcophagus and Unit No. 4. The IAEA said that radiation levels at the site remained normal.

== Decommissioning ==
After the explosion at reactor No. 4 and construction of the sarcophagus, the remaining three reactors were de-contaminated and re-launched (reactor No. 1 on 1 October 1986, reactor No. 2 on 5 November 1986, &amp; reactor No. 3 on 4 December 1987) and continued to operate until the post-Soviet period. The Chernobyl New Safe Confinement is equipped with two overhead main cranes, which will be used to remove unstable parts of the original sarcophagus. The majority of the external gamma radiation emissions at the site are from the isotope caesium-137, which has a half-life of 30.17 years. , the radiation exposure from that radionuclide has declined by half since the 1986 accident.

On 11 October 1991, reactor No. 2 caught fire, and was subsequently shut down. Ukraine&#x27;s 1991 independence from the Soviet Union generated further discussion on the Chernobyl topic, because the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine&#x27;s new parliament, was composed largely of young reformers. Discussions about the future of nuclear energy in Ukraine ultimately moved the government toward a decision to decommission reactor No. 2.

On 30 November 1996, following pressure from foreign governments, reactor No. 1 was shut down. Removal of uncontaminated equipment began at reactor No. 1 in 2007.

On 15 December 2000, reactor No. 3 was shut down after operating briefly since March 1999 following almost three months of repairs, and the plant as a whole ceased producing electricity. In April 2015, units 1 through 3 entered the decommissioning phase. Upon being shut down, the plant was re-classified as a &#x27;State Special Enterprise,&#x27; while &#x27;V. I. Lenin&#x27; was removed from the name following Ukraine&#x27;s independence.

In 2013, the pump lifting river water into the cooling reservoir adjacent to the facility was powered down, with the thermal sink expected to slowly evaporate.
Originally announced in June 2003, a new steel containment structure named the New Safe Confinement was built to replace the aging and hastily built sarcophagus that protected ruined reactor No. 4. Though the project&#x27;s development had been delayed several times, construction officially began in September 2010. The New Safe Confinement was financed by an international fund managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and was designed and built by the French-led consortium Novarka.

In February 2013, a portion of the roof and wall adjacent to the covered part of the turbine hall collapsed into the entombed area of the turbine hall. The collapse did not affect any other part of the Object Shelter (sarcophagus) or the New Safe Confinement. No variances in radiation levels as a result of the incident were detected. The collapsed roof was built after the Chernobyl disaster and was later repaired.

Novarka built a large arch-shaped structure out of steel wide, high, and long to cover the old crumbling concrete dome that was in use at the time. The structure was built in two segments which were joined in August 2015. In November 2016, the completed arch was placed over the existing sarcophagus. This steel casing project was expected to cost $1.4 billion, and was completed in 2017. The casing also meets the definition of a nuclear entombment device.

A separate deal has been made with the American firm Holtec International to build a storage facility within the exclusion zone for nuclear waste produced by Chernobyl. This facility, named the Interim Storage Facility 2, has storage for the 21,297 Spent Fuel assemblies currently at the power plant, which will be loaded into approximately 231 waste canisters, and stored in the ISF-2 for 100 years. In 2020, the storage facility was completed, and on November 18, 2020, the first canister of nuclear waste was loaded into the storage area.

<text>Boscov&#x27;s Inc. is a family-owned department store with fifty locations in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, Connecticut, West Virginia and Rhode Island. Twenty-six of these stores are located in Pennsylvania.

Corporate headquarters are located in Exeter Township, Pennsylvania, near Reading. The company chairman is Jim Boscov, who took over after his uncle Albert Boscov retired.

== History ==
Solomon &quot;Sol&quot; Boscov was of Jewish descent. He emigrated from Russia to Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1911. He had $1.37 in cash (equal to $ today) on arrival in the United States. He worked as a traveling salesman with an initial $8 worth of merchandise. Because he spoke Yiddish, he was able to converse with people in Berks County who spoke Pennsylvania Dutch. Boscov&#x27;s fortunes changed in 1914 when he opened the first Boscov&#x27;s store at 9th and Pike streets in Reading. A Pennsylvania Historical Marker commemorating Solomon Boscov stands at the site of the original store.

Boscov&#x27;s began expanding in the Reading suburbs during the 1960s, with the Boscov&#x27;s West store in Sinking Spring opening in November 1962 and the Boscov&#x27;s North store at the Reading Fairgrounds in Muhlenberg Township opening in August 1965. The Boscov&#x27;s East store along 9th Street in Reading was destroyed by fire in February 1967 and was replaced by a new Boscov&#x27;s East store in Exeter Township in November 1967. The Boscov&#x27;s West store was destroyed by fire in November 1967 and reopened in November 1968.

By 1968, Boscov&#x27;s had five stores, 2,200 workers, and annual sales exceeding $50 million. Solomon Boscov retired and was succeeded by his son Albert &quot;Albie&quot; Boscov as head of the company in 1960. The first Boscov&#x27;s location outside of Berks County opened at the Lebanon Valley Mall in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, in August 1972. Boscov&#x27;s bought Fowler, Dick and Walker, the Boston Store in 1980. One of Wilkes-Barre&#x27;s last remaining downtown department stores, it was Boscov&#x27;s first multi-story store.

Boscov&#x27;s opened its first location outside of Pennsylvania at the Dover Mall in Dover, Delaware, in August 1982. Boscov&#x27;s first entered the Philadelphia market in the late 1980s by opening Ports of the World stores. These stores would later be re-branded as Boscov&#x27;s sometime in the mid-1990s.

In 1983, Boscov&#x27;s leased the Fowler&#x27;s department store building and opened the next year in downtown Binghamton, New York.

In August 2002, Boscov&#x27;s opened a store at the Berkshire Mall in Wyomissing, replacing a Strawbridge&#x27;s store. As a result, the Boscov&#x27;s West store in Sinking Spring closed.

In 2006, Albert Boscov, the son of Solomon Boscov, retired and his nephew Kenneth Lakin became chairman and chief executive. Lakin led an aggressive expansion of the chain, opening 10 new stores by 2008. Boscov&#x27;s acquired these locations from Federated Department Stores following the merger with The May Department Stores Company. The new stores opened just prior to the 2008 economic downturn and in August 2008, Boscov&#x27;s filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Albert Boscov came out of retirement and regained control of the company. As part of the bankruptcy, 10 stores were shuttered, two of which were reopened. The company emerged from bankruptcy in September 2009.

Albert Boscov died from pancreatic cancer on February 10, 2017, at the age of eighty-seven. The chain is now headed by his nephew, Jim Boscov.

Boscov&#x27;s continuing success makes it regarded as somewhat of an &quot;outlier&quot; because many department store retailers had begun pulling back to a degree on brick-and-mortar formats. Boscov&#x27;s saw record sales of $1.2 billion in 2017. Since 2009, the chain continues to expand and opened its 47th store in Milford, Connecticut, in October 2018. Boscov&#x27;s plans to continue to open one store per year and has invested in older stores by renovating them. Boscov&#x27;s announced plans to move into the Providence Place mall in Providence, Rhode Island, in 2019. The store opened on September 26, 2019.

In 2020, Boscov&#x27;s announced plans to open at Eastwood Mall in Niles, Ohio. The store opened on October 7, 2021, a year late due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, Boscov&#x27;s announced that a store will open at the Meadowbrook Mall in Bridgeport, West Virginia, in the later part of the year; this will be Boscov&#x27;s 50th store and first location in the state. The 50th store located in West Virginia opened on October 7, 2023.

==Civic affairs and charitable giving==
During the 1970s, Boscov&#x27;s launched its &quot;Friends Helping Friends&quot; program, an annual fundraising event which has raised roughly a million dollars each year for non-profit organizations.

=== Jazz festival ===
Boscov&#x27;s sponsors the annual &quot;Boscov&#x27;s Berks Jazz Fest&quot; which draws 35,000 to 40,000 people to the Reading area.

=== Thanksgiving Day Parade ===
When Gimbels went out of business in 1986, WPVI-TV and Boscov&#x27;s took over the sponsorship of the Philadelphia Thanksgiving Day Parade. Boscov&#x27;s remained a co-sponsor until 2007.

==In popular culture==

The Boscov&#x27;s in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, was used to represent the fictional department store Illustra in the 1987 film &quot;Mannequin&quot;.

Boscov&#x27;s is mentioned in the Season 3 episode &quot;Kimmy Steps on a Crack!&quot; of the Netflix comedy series &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;.

It is also mentioned in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Office&quot;, Season 5, Episode 25, “Casual Friday”.

<text>The Florida West Coast Railroad was a 13-mile (21-kilometre) railroad owned by CSF Acquisition, Inc., which acquired it from CSX on December 13, 1987 as its first acquisition. It ran west from a CSX line at Newberry to Trenton.

The railroad used to extend west to Cross City, with a branch south to Chiefland. All the lines were originally owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad.

On February 25, 2004, the company applied to the Surface Transportation Board to abandon almost the whole line. The case was decided March 11, 2004, and the company was allowed to abandon all of the line.

By notice to the STB on May 13, 2010, Florida West Coast Railroad abandoned 10.3 miles of the railroad from Newberry to Trenton. The consummation of abandonment did not include the easternmost portion of the railroad. The portion that was abandoned was subsequently acquired by the State of Florida Department of Environmental Protection to be used to extend the Nature Coast State Trail.

<text>Interstate 465 (I-465), also known as the USS Indianapolis Memorial Highway, is the beltway circling Indianapolis, Indiana. It is roughly rectangular in shape and has a perimeter of approximately . It lies almost completely within the boundaries of Marion County, except for two short sections on the north leg in Boone and Hamilton counties. It intersects with I-65, I-69, I-70, and I-74 and provides additional access to I-65 via I-865.

==Route description==

Starting as exit numbers do, I-465 begins at an interchange with I-65 at exit 53, running concurrently with I-69, I-74, US 31, US 36, US 40, SR 37, and SR 67. Moving west, US 31 leaves the Interstate southbound at exit 2. All routes that I-465 meets in this direction (clockwise) move the opposite direction (counterclockwise), except US 52. I-69 and unsigned SR 37 leave the beltway at exit 5 before crossing the White River. Afterwards, at exit 8, SR 67 also exits the loop with Kentucky Avenue. I-465 then meets I-70 at exit 9 near the Indianapolis International Airport. After this interchange, the Interstate then changes direction.

Now northbound, US 40 leaves at exit 12, followed by US 36 at exit 13, towards Plainfield and Avon, respectively. I-74 finally leaves the beltway at exit 16, and US 136 ends just past the interchange. At exit 20, I-465 has a directional access interchange with its parent, I-65. Before the Interstate turns east, at exit 25, I-865 moves west toward I-65 northbound. I-865 eastbound merges into I-465 east, bringing eastbound US 52 with it. As previously mentioned, I-465 then turns east.

Moving eastbound, US 421 meets at exit 27. US 421 northbound exits from westbound I-465, and US 421 southbound enters eastbound. US 31 south also enters the beltway at exit 31. After passing former SR 431 (Keystone Parkway) at exit 33, I-69 southbound enters I-465 in this direction at exit 37. Afterwards, I-465 turns southward.

After the directional change, the Interstate meets Shadeland Avenue, former SR 100, at exit 40. At exit 42, westbound US 36 and southbound SR 67 reenter the beltway. I-70 once again meets I-465 at exit 44. At exit 46, US 40 west reenters the beltway, while US 52 leaves at exit 47. US 421 leaves at exit 49, and I-74 west enters the loop at the same exit. Along with this, I-465 completes its final directional change westbound.

Now moving westbound again, I-465 only has one more interchange (exit 52) before meeting I-65 once again at exit 53, and exit numbers then reset.

All U.S. and state highways that formerly were routed through the central part of Indianapolis are now routed concurrently with I-465. Only I-65 and I-70 run through Downtown Indianapolis.

Non-Interstate Highway route markers are not posted along I-465 itself; rather, signs on the entrance ramps direct traffic traveling a particular route to follow I-465 to a specific exit to continue on that route.

Despite being unsigned, an approximately section between exits 46 and 47 carries nine designations: I-465, I-69, US 31, US 36, US 40, US 52, US 421, and SR 67, tying a short segment of Georgia State Route 10 Loop in Athens, Georgia, for the largest concurrency in the United States.

==History==
===Planning and alignment selection===
A beltway for Indianapolis was part of the original plan of the Interstate Highway System in 1955. The general alignment was to be either on or adjacent to the now-defunct SR 100, which, by then, had only two completed legs—on the north side, along 86th Street west of the White River and 82nd Street east of the river, and on the east side, along Shadeland Avenue. On the city&#x27;s west side, an alignment corridor paralleling High School Road was preferred, and, on the south side, one between Hanna Avenue and Thompson Road had been proposed. Development along 86th Street made its use unfeasible for I-465, so a 91st Street alignment was initially proposed. This proved to be controversial and caused many delays in final alignment selection for the north leg, postponing its construction by several years.

===Initial construction (1959–1970)===
The I-465 beltway was constructed in segments. There were 16 segments along the original proposed semicircumferential alignment between I-65 in Boone County at exit 129 and that same highway to the south at exit 123 in Marion County. Indiana highway officials recognized the value of having the route be a full circumferential, so using non-Interstate federal funding and employing a temporary designation of SR 100, they planned a separate 17th segment northward between I-65 at its exit 123 and the north leg of I-465 in Boone County. By the time that added section was completed in 1970, Indiana had obtained federal approval to sign it as I-465 as well, resulting in the creation of a dogleg section of I-465 outside of the loop (now signed as I-865).

State highway officials concentrated on building the west and south legs of I-465 early in the overall project, since they were the missing portions of the SR 100 concept. Construction began in 1959, and the first section of the I-465 beltway to be completed was the portion on the west leg between I-65 near Eagle Creek Park and I-74/US 136 in Speedway. That section was opened to traffic on September 26, 1961, simultaneously with the adjacent section of I-65 northwest from there running to 71st Street. By July 18, 1962, all four segments of the original west leg were open between SR 67 (Kentucky Avenue) and I-65, but the interchange with I-70 in that stretch was not completed until much later that decade when the segment of that route from I-465 west to SR 43 opened in 1968.

The south side sections were the next to be completed, with three opening in the second half of 1963 and two more on October 15, 1964. This completed both the south leg and the first segment of the east leg and included a connection from a point just north of the Raymond Street grade separation to SR 100 (Shadeland Avenue) at Washington Street (US 40). With these sections open, the full length of I-74&#x27;s concurrency over I-465 was now available for motorists. The south leg&#x27;s junction with I-65 was also completed, but I-65 itself was open only between a temporary intersection at Thompson Road to the south and the Keystone Avenue interchange north of I-465 until early 1971.

With SR 100/Shadeland Avenue connected to the full southern and western bypass of Indianapolis, work on I-465&#x27;s east leg slowed, delaying the opening of the next segment over three years. In January 1968, two sections of the east leg, between US 36/SR 67 (Pendleton Pike) and the SR 100 junction near Raymond Street, were completed and opened a day apart. This allowed through traffic from both US 36 and SR 67 to bypass the increasingly congested SR 100. The interchange with I-70 in this newly opened section was not yet complete, and its ramps did not open until the opening of that route&#x27;s mainline between SR 100/Shadeland Avenue and SR 9 near Greenfield on December 2 of that year. On October 23, 1968, the section of I-465 between Pendleton Pike and 56th Street at Shadeland Avenue was finished and opened to traffic, completing the east leg&#x27;s eastern bypass of SR 100.

With its alignment controversies now settled, the north leg of I-465 began to take shape in the late 1960s. The section between US 421 (Michigan Road) and US 31 (Meridian Street) was the first on this side of town to see traffic on October 20, 1968. A year to the day later, the segment from US 31 to Keystone Avenue (then SR 431) was opened to motorists. The next month, in November 1969, the north extension of the west leg was completed and signed as I-465 (although it was considered to be &quot;added mileage&quot; by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) since it was built to Interstate standards using non-Interstate funds by Indiana), but only the portion between I-65 and 86th Street was opened to traffic because the segment of the north leg to which it would connect was not yet complete. That occurred on August 18, 1970, when the western end of the north leg between I-65 near Royalton and Michigan Road (US 421) was finished and opened to traffic. At that time, the final connection on the north extension of the west leg to 86th Street was also opened, leaving only one remaining gap in the entire I-465 route.

The final section of I-465 to be built was the portion joining the north and east legs between Keystone Avenue (then SR 431) and 56th Street at Shadeland Avenue (then SR 100). This stretch opened to traffic on October 5, 1970, and marked the completion of the I-465 beltway around Indianapolis.

===Subsequent changes===

In 2000, the Emerson Avenue interchange on the south leg was converted from a conventional diamond to a single-point urban interchange (SPUI), becoming the first SPUI on the I-465 beltway.

The first of the major post-completion rebuild and expansion projects occurred from 1999 to 2002, when the heavily traveled northern section of the east leg was modernized and expanded to as many as 13 lanes in one short portion. Concurrently, the east junction with I-70 was rebuilt and reconfigured. 

In April 2002, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) announced the redesignation of the dogleg portion of I-465 as I-865. This change eliminated the three-way intersection of I-465 where the north extension of the west leg met the original north leg (at exit 25).

Between 2004 and 2005, the north extension of I-465&#x27;s west leg between I-65 and I-865 was rebuilt to widen and update the freeway in this heavily traveled section located along the western edge of the massive Park 100 commercial and industrial development. This segment was rapidly becoming functionally obsolete due to continued growth of that complex as well as that of other nearby residential and commercial projects in Pike Township. Both interchanges along this stretch, 71st Street (exit 21) and 86th Street (exit 23), were totally rebuilt while remaining open to traffic and had loop ramps added for west-to-south movements. In addition, a new northbound exit ramp was added at exit 21 which bridges over 71st Street to directly deposit motorists onto eastbound 73rd Street. On the mainline, dual auxiliary lanes were added in each travel direction between these interchanges and the 79th Street grade separation over I-465 was demolished and rebuilt to allow for the widened freeway below. Distinctive decorative features were also incorporated into most of the grade separation structures within this project. Also, bicycle paths were established along the southern side of both 86th and 71st streets, which included grade separations with the east-to-south ramps at both interchanges.

Indianapolis native David Letterman had quintuple bypass surgery in 2000, and, two years later, suggested on his show that I-465 should be renamed the David Letterman Bypass, going so far as to call the mayor of Indianapolis during the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. At the time of the gag on his show, Letterman had offered $10 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the honor, later offering just to pay to change the signs. In 2011 the Indiana General Assembly passed a resolution officially designating I-465 as &quot;USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot; Memorial Highway&quot; in &quot;the memory of the brave sailors who lost their lives&quot; when USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot; was sunk in the Pacific during World War II. Signs for this designation have been erected sporadically around the loop, but the highway is still referred to nearly exclusively as &quot;I-465&quot; or simply &quot;465&quot; by most locals.

INDOT completed an $800-million (equivalent to $ in ) project called Accelerate 465 to refurbish and reconfigure the original west leg of the loop between July 2007 and December 2012. This project completely rebuilt and added new travel lanes, added auxiliary lanes, rebuilt many grade separations, and reconfigured nearly all of the interchanges along I-465 from just north of the Kentucky Avenue (SR 67 south) interchange to the 56th Street partial interchange. The junction with I-74 and Crawfordsville Road (US 136 west) was reconfigured to allow direct access between I-465 and US 136 for the first time. Interlaced into that design is a full directional connection for I-74, which replaced the former cloverleaf interchange and removed its original stub connector east of I-465 to the intersection of Crawfordsville Road and High School Road in Speedway.

In 2007, another undertaking was launched by INDOT to modernize the entire northeastern portion of I-465. All three interchanges along the freeway in this stretch—Keystone Avenue (exit 33), Allisonville Road (exit 35) and I-69/Binford Boulevard (exit 37)—were to be modified and rebuilt. As this project progressed, financial constraints prompted INDOT to scale back its scope. The original, scaled-back project concluded by the end of 2012. The beltway&#x27;s mainline was reconstructed with additional travel and auxiliary lanes being added in two separate segments—from east of Meridian Street to Allisonville Road and from a point at the southeast end of the I-69/Binford interchange southward to Fall Creek.

The Keystone Avenue partial cloverleaf interchange was reconfigured to allow free-flowing access for most of the movements between I-465 and Keystone. Although Keystone operates as a controlled-access highway both north of I-465 and up to the first junction south of the Interstate, the movements from westbound I-465 to southbound Keystone and from eastbound I-465 to northbound Keystone are not free-flowing but are left turns controlled by traffic lights.

At Allisonville Road, the interchange was converted into a more efficient SPUI configuration. Finally, though the interchange itself was not rebuilt, the I-69/Binford Boulevard junction had two ramps slightly modified to facilitate better traffic flow.

As part of its Operation Indy Commute project, INDOT began work in 2013 to widen I-65 on both its northbound and southbound mainlines from exit 103 at Southport Road northward to the junction with I-465&#x27;s south leg, which would also be modified. To reduce congestion at and near that interchange, the loop ramp from westbound I-465 to southbound I-65 was replaced by a flyover ramp. The eastbound I-465 exit to southbound I-65 was also expanded for smoother merging with the new west-to-south flyover. In addition, grade separations over I-465 were replaced on Sherman Drive and Carson Avenue to allow for longer and wider approaches to this busy junction. Most of this work was completed in late 2014.

As part of the major project to upgrade of US 31 in Hamilton County to a full Interstate-standard freeway, the I-465 north leg interchange at Meridian Street (exit 31) was reconfigured between October 2013 and December 2015 (with some additional work continuing until November 22, 2016) to the present partial directional (system interchange) design which allows for free-flow movements to or from the new US 31 freeway to the north.

In 2022, construction began on Clear Path 465, a project involving widening I-465 between the White River and Fall Creek, as well as rebuilding the interchange of I-465 and I-69 in the northeast region of Indianapolis. As part of this project, the interchange will be reconfigured to provide a direct movement for traffic on I-69 to continue onto I-465 southbound, which will be concurrent with I-69 upon the interstate&#x27;s completion.On August 6 and 9, 2024, the interchange between I-69 and I-465 on the southwest side of Indianapolis (exit 5) officially opened to traffic, with I-69 running concurrently with I-465 on the southeast half of the beltway between exits 5 and 37. With the portion between exits 5 and 49 also including part of the existing concurrency of I-465 and I-74, this created another instance of a three-route concurrency within the Interstate Highway System, the other two (both in Wisconsin) being in Milwaukee and between Madison and Portage.

==Future==
Remaining sections of the I-465 beltway that are still awaiting reconstruction or widening projects include the west leg junction with I-65, the north leg between I-865 and US 31 north/Meridian Street, and several portions along the southeast leg.

<text>Elisabetta Olga Laura Brusa (born 3 April 1954) is an Italian/British composer.

Brusa was born in Milan, and as a child wrote 32 piano pieces. At the Milan Conservatory she formally studied Composition with Bruno Bettinelli (who also taught famous Italian conductors like Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti) and Azio Corghi, graduating in 1980. She then taught composition at the Conservatoires of Vicenza, Mantova and Brescia before teaching at the Conservatorio of Milan in 1985. She also received instruction from Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and Hans Keller. She first appeared on the &quot;Young Italian Composers&quot; RAI 3 television programme in 1983.

After winning first prize at the Washington International Competition for Composition for String Quartet in 1982, she was awarded the Fromm Music Foundation Fellowship and a Fellowship of the U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission the next year to follow the Composition classes at the Tanglewood Music Center and three Fellowships from the MacDowell Colony later in the decade. In 1997 she married the conductor Gilberto Serembe.

Currently, she is best known for her orchestral works recorded in five volumes on the Naxos Records label. She is often inspired by works of Literature and Art as well as of Music of all ages but the latter are never quoted or imitated in her works. These include two Symphonies, a Requiem, a Stabat Mater, the tone poem &quot;Florestan&quot;, based on the Florestan side of Robert Schumann&#x27;s personality; the &quot;Nittemero Symphony&quot;, inspired by the words &quot;night&quot; and &quot;day&quot; in ancient Greek; the tone poem &quot;Messidor&quot;, which alludes strongly to (without actually quoting) Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s incidental music to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (the work is dedicated to her husband), a &quot;Fanfare&quot;, an &quot;Adagio&quot;, &quot;Firelights&quot;, a &quot;Requiescat&quot;, &quot;Favole&quot;, &quot;Merlin&quot;, &quot;Simply Largo, all of which for orchestras of different sizes, among other works. Brusa describes her musical style as &quot;close to Neo-Tonality and in particular to Neo-Romanticism, but in the original sense of the word, which is nowadays often confusedly assimilated to other ones,&quot; and her harmony as &quot;essentially pandiatonic with panchromatic moments.&quot;

Her music has been performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Hungarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, Ulster Orchestra, BBC Philharmonic, BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, RSNO Royal Scottish National Orchestra, CBC Vancouver Orchestra, http://www.masterorchestraproduction.org/state-hermitage-symphony-orchestra.html State Hermitage Orchestra, St. Petersburg Symphony Orchestra, Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra, The Women&#x27;s Philharmonic of San Francisco, to name just a few.

<doc id="1239015" wikidata="Q1132939" url="?curid=1239015" title="Corinto, Nicaragua">
<text>Corinto is a town, with a population of 18,602 (2022 estimate), on the northwest Pacific coast of Nicaragua in the province of Chinandega. The municipality was founded in 1863.

==History==
===Early years===
The town of Corinto was founded in 1849. It first came into prominence as a port in 1863, due to its spacious and sheltered harbour. It superseded El Realejo, which was from 1550 to 1850 the principal seaport of Nicaragua but became partly filled with sandbanks.

===British occupation===
When Nicaragua refused to pay Britain an indemnity for the annexation of the Mosquito Reserve, the British responded by occupying the Nicaraguan Pacific port of Corinto on 27 April 1895. Eventually the British left after being paid indemnities by the Nicaraguan government.

=== United States intervention ===
On May 2, 1896, U.S. Marines landed in Corinto to protect American interests during political unrest.

In 1909, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed the African-American writer James Weldon Johnson U.S. Consul to Corinto.

On January 25, 1922, the USS &quot;Galveston&quot; landed a detachment of U.S. Marines at Corinto, to reinforce the Managua legation guard during a period of political tension.

While supporting the Contra war against the Sandinista government in the 1980s, U.S. Forces mined the Port of Corinto. On October 10, 1983, an attack destroyed of fuel. It is believed that this attack was directed by the CIA and carried out by U.S. Navy Seals.

== Economy ==
Corinto was a railroad terminus and is Nicaragua&#x27;s largest and only Pacific port for the import and export of goods. It has a container terminal and is able to manage a wide variety of cargo: liquid, bulk, containers, cars, etc.

==International relations==
===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Corinto is twinned with:
* Bremen, Germany
* Cologne, Germany
* Liverpool, United Kingdom
* Portland, Oregon, United States

<doc id="1239024" wikidata="Q4899482" url="?curid=1239024" title="Beverly Briley">
<text>Clifton Beverly Briley (January 11, 1914 – September 14, 1980) was an American attorney and politician, the first mayor of the newly consolidated metropolitan government of Nashville and Davidson County in Tennessee. Elected to the mayor&#x27;s position in 1962 as a Democrat, Briley served three terms from 1963 to 1975; he was prevented by term limits from running again. He had previously served as county judge (chief executive) of Davidson County for several terms, from 1950 to 1963.

==Early life==
Briley was born in West Nashville, Tennessee in 1914. Attending local schools, he became involved in Scouting as a boy and attained the rank of Eagle Scout. He attended Vanderbilt University before transferring to Cumberland University&#x27;s law school (now the Cumberland Law School at Samford University), graduating in 1932. He was admitted to the bar in 1932.

==Career==
Briley began practicing in 1932. Briley served in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a quartermaster aboard the USS &quot;David Taylor&quot;. After the war, he ran a successful campaign for county judge (chief executive) of Davidson County in 1950, serving until 1963.

Briley was a champion of metropolitan government and supported the merger of Nashville and Davidson County government. In 1963 he won election against Davidson County tax assessor Clifford Allen, another longtime Nashville politician, and became the first mayor of what is known as Metro Nashville. In 1966, his main opponent was Ben West, the former mayor of the earlier City of Nashville municipal government. Briley won the election in a runoff. Briley was reelected in 1971, also in a runoff. He was prevented by term limits from running again in 1975. He remained active in Nashville politics until his death five years later. Altogether, he served as chief executive of Davidson County and of Nashville for 25 years.

Briley took a fairly progressive position on the Civil Rights Movement, an important question for mayors of Southern cities at the time. He readily cooperated with black leaders and is generally credited with helping smooth the transition away from racial segregation in Nashville. Public schools and lunch counters had already been desegregated by the time he took office. In 1965, Briley described the Ku Klux Klan as &quot;merchants of hate&quot; and said they were &quot;not welcome&quot; in Nashville.

On other issues, he was a conservative Democrat; in 1972 he was the area leader of &quot;Democrats for Nixon,&quot; in an effort to strengthen southern support for Republican national candidates. That year, Nixon became the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Davidson County since the Reconstruction era. Most Republicans had been disenfranchised in Tennessee and other Southern states as Southern Democrats passed new constitutions after the Civil War to suppress black voting by raising barriers to voter registration.

==Personal life and death==
Briley married Dorothy Gordon in 1934. They had two children together, Cliff and Diane. He was an alcoholic. His grandson David Briley was the Mayor of Nashville after the resignation of Megan Barry.

Briley died of bladder cancer on September 14, 1980, at the Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville at the age of 66, just months after the death of his wife. His funeral was held at the Inglewood Baptist Church, and he was buried at Spring Hill Cemetery in Nashville.

==Legacy and honors==
Briley Parkway, a major beltway thoroughfare which runs by the Grand Ole Opry House and around much of the city, was named in his honor.

The city-owned Beverly Briley Building, a major component of Nashville&#x27;s redesigned Public Square, was named for him.

His grandson, Rob Briley, was a politician who formerly represented the 52nd House District, a Nashville district, in the state legislature. He also served as the Democratic Majority Floor Leader. Another grandson, David Briley, served as mayor of Nashville.

<doc id="1239025" wikidata="Q2602462" url="?curid=1239025" title="Manx Loaghtan">
<text>The Manx Loaghtan ( ) is a rare breed of sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;) native to the Isle of Man. It is sometimes spelled as &quot;Loaghtyn&quot; or &quot;Loghtan&quot;. The sheep have dark brown wool and usually four or occasionally six horns.

The Manx Loaghtan is one of the Northern European short-tailed sheep breeds, and descends from the primitive sheep once found throughout Scotland, the Hebrides, and Shetland Islands. The word Loaghtan comes from the Manx words &quot;lugh dhoan&quot;, which mean mouse-brown and describe the colour of the sheep. This breed is primarily raised for its meat, which some consider a delicacy. In 2008, the meat received EU recognition and protection under the Protected Designation of Origin scheme, which requires products with a regional name to originate in the named region.

The Rare Breeds Survival Trust has characterised the Loaghtan as &quot;at risk&quot;. By the 1950s there were only 43 surviving specimens. Manx National Heritage developed two healthy flocks. These have given rise to commercial flocks on the Isle of Man, United Kingdom and Jersey. Even so, today there are still fewer than 1,500 registered breeding females.

==Appearance==

The Manx Loaghtan is a small sheep, with no wool on their dark brown faces and legs. The sheep have short tails and are fine-boned. In the past century the sheep&#x27;s colour has stabilised as &quot;moorit&quot;, that is shades between fawn and dark reddish brown, though the colour bleaches in the sun. Manx Loaghtan usually have four horns, but individuals are also found with two or six horns. The horns are generally small on the ewes but larger and stronger on the males. An adult female weighs about 40 kg, and an adult male weighs around 60 kg.

==Products==
===Meat===
The Loaghtan is farmed for its meat on the Isle of Man, with only two principal farms on the island producing it. There are now many holdings on the UK mainland that also breed Loaghtans, including some farms with over 100 ewes: for example the Fowlescombe Flock in Devon. This gourmet meat is highly prized, often being sold as hogget or mutton from well-finished animals. A 15-month-old will yield a carcass of 18 kg of lean meat.

There is a large flock of the sheep on the Calf of Man, and access to the Isle of Man was closed to protect them during the 2001 UK Foot and Mouth Disease epidemic. The disease did not reach the island itself, nor the Calf, which continued exports of the meat to the continent of Europe.

The breed is listed in the Ark of Taste, an international catalogue of endangered heritage foods that the global Slow Food movement maintains.

===Wool===
Craft spinners and weavers like the wool for its softness and rich brown colour. The crafters use the undyed material to produce woollens and tweeds. 

The Loaghtan&#x27;s wool has a high coating of lanolin wax, also known as wool wax or wool grease. Warm weather makes the lanolin viscous, which aids shearing. Some speciality soap producers also use the lanolin as an ingredient in a mild soap.

==Jersey==

The Loaghtan is believed to be the closest surviving relative of the now extinct Jersey sheep. Already in medieval times, Jersey was famous for its woolens. Consequently, the name of the island became a generic term for the jersey, an item of knitted clothing, worn as a pullover.

In 2008 the National Trust for Jersey began a programme of introducing Loaghtans into Jersey for coastal grazing, a traditional method of vegetation control in the north of Jersey. In 2014, two shepherds cared for a flock that had grown from 20 to 231 animals. The wool from Jersey&#x27;s flock of Loaghtans is sold locally.

==Ecology==
There appears to be a link between the presence of Loaghtan sheep and the ability of the chough to thrive. Studies on Ramsey Island, Bardsey Island, and the Isle of Man have found that as the number of grazing sheep fell, so did the number of breeding choughs; when sheep grazing increased, so did the number of breeding choughs. This appears to be happening on Jersey as well.

As the Loaghtans graze, they crop and trample the grass. This enables the birds to reach surface-active and soil insects. Also, the dung the sheep leave draws beetles and fly larvae. These insects in turn are a resource for the birds when the ground is hard or other insects are scarce.

<text>Robert Tear, CBE (8 March 1939 – 29 March 2011) was a Welsh tenor singer, teacher and conductor. He first became known singing in the operas of Benjamin Britten in the mid-1960s. From the 1970s until his retirement in 1999 his main operatic base was the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; he appeared with other opera companies in the UK, mainland Europe, the US and Australia. Generally avoiding the Italian repertoire, which did not suit his voice, Tear became known in leading and character roles in German, British and Russian operas.

Tear&#x27;s concert repertoire was wide, extending from music from the 17th century to contemporary works by Britten, Tippett and others. He conducted for some years from the mid-1980s, but found himself temperamentally unsuited to it. As a teacher at the Royal Academy of Music he was happier, and was well regarded by colleagues and pupils.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Tear was born in Barry, Glamorgan, the son of Thomas Tear, a railway clerk, and his wife Edith, &quot;née&quot; Dodds. As a schoolboy at Barry Boys&#x27; Grammar School he sang in a local church choir and at the age of seven he took part in the nascent Welsh National Opera&#x27;s first production, &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; in Cardiff in April 1946. In 1957 he won a choral scholarship to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied English. His biographer Raymond Holden counts as his chief university influences the critic and teacher F. R. Leavis, the writer E. M. Forster and the conductor David Willcocks.

Tear graduated in 1960, and moved to London. where in 1961 he was appointed a vicar choral at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. His choir duties left him time to study with the singing teacher Julian Kimbell and to sing with the Ambrosian Singers. In January 1961 he married Hilary Thomas; they had two daughters.

Tear made his operatic debut in 1963 as the Male Chorus in Britten&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot; with the English Opera Group (EOG); the composer approved of Tear&#x27;s performance, and invited him to understudy Peter Pears in the original production of &quot;Curlew River&quot; at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1964. Tear then played Peter Quint in a production of &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, before joining Britten and the EOG in a four-week tour of the Soviet Union in September and October 1964. Britten wrote two roles with Tear&#x27;s voice in mind: Misael in &quot;The Burning Fiery Furnace&quot; (1966) and the title role in &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; (1968). For the EOG Tear also created the role of Private Todd in Gordon Crosse&#x27;s &quot;The Grace of Todd&quot; (1969) and sang Arbace (1969) and later the title role (1973) in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot;.

Tear was never a member of Britten&#x27;s inner circle; he failed to treat the composer with the required reverence, and was seen as a threat to Pears&#x27;s preeminence as leading tenor. When he chose, in 1970, to create the role of Dov in Michael Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Knot Garden&quot; for the Royal Opera rather than appearing in the premiere of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; he became one of Britten&#x27;s &quot;corpses&quot; – former colleagues from whom he completely cut off contact once they had outlived their usefulness to him or offended him. He continued to perform in Britten&#x27;s operas and concert works, but never saw the composer again.

===Peak years===
Concurrently with his developing operatic career, Tear built up a reputation as a concert singer. In 1965 he made his debut at the Edinburgh Festival, singing Tippett&#x27;s song cycle &quot;The Heart&#x27;s Assurance&quot;; in the same year he made the first of fifty-four appearances at the Proms, in Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Paukenmesse&quot;, conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent. His repertoire ranged from Tudor music to the most modern works.

Tear sang with many opera companies in Britain, continental Europe, Australia and the US, but his principal base was Covent Garden. His voice was described by his obituarist in &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;typically British: less expansive than the Italian style and with little of the German heroic tenor in it, but pure, elegant, flexible, capable of sweetness and with a expressive quality at the service of fine musicianship and great intelligence.&quot; Italian opera did not appeal to him; his rare performances in that repertoire were Malcolm in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, Gastone in &quot;La traviata&quot;, the comic character roles of Dr Caius in &quot;Falstaff&quot; and Alcindoro in &quot;La bohème&quot;, and the one Italian role with which he became associated, the Emperor Altoum in &quot;Turandot&quot;, which he first sang at the Royal Opera House in 1984 and in which he made his final appearance there, in 2009. At Covent Garden and elsewhere he sang many leading roles, such as Captain Vere in &quot;Billy Budd&quot;, the title role in &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, Aschenbach in &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, Lensky in &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, Herod in &quot;Salome&quot;, Loge in &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, Belmonte in &quot;The Seraglio&quot;, and David in &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;. A greater part of his operatic repertoire consisted of character roles, in which, in the view of &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;his humour and his sharp human perceptions were given free rein&quot;. They included Monostatos in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, Don Basilio in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, Jaquino in &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Spalanzani in &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, Valzacchi in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, and Aegisth in &quot;Elektra&quot;.

===Later years===
In 1980 Tear made his debut as a conductor with the Thames Chamber Orchestra at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Although he subsequently conducted the London Mozart Players and the Minneapolis, English Chamber, London Symphony and Philharmonia orchestras, he found that he was temperamentally unsuited to conducting, because his friendly and easy-going nature made it difficult for him to exert the authority and discipline required in conductors. He found more satisfaction in his role as a teacher; he was the first incumbent of the international chair of singing at the Royal Academy of Music, London. He held it from 1987 to 1989, and was judged a success by students and staff.

After his official retirement, Tear made a cameo appearance at the 2009 Proms as Bunthorne&#x27;s solicitor in a performance of &quot;Patience&quot;, conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, whose final Prom appearance it also was.

Tear died of bronchopneumonia, secondary to oesophageal cancer, at his home in Hammersmith, London, on 29 March 2011. A memorial service was held in September of that year at St Martin-in-the-Fields, at which readings and songs were performed by Tear&#x27;s former colleagues including Dame Janet Baker, Sir Thomas Allen, John Mark Ainsley, Sir John Tomlinson and Dame Felicity Palmer.

==Honours and publications==
In 1984 Tear was appointed CBE. He was an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama and of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

Tear published two volumes of memoirs: &quot;Tear Here&quot; (1990) and &quot;Singer Beware&quot; (1995). In a memorial tribute Robert Ponsonby commented that they were both written &quot;in a style so odd, so metaphysical and so idiosyncratic as sometimes to defy comprehension&quot;, although Tear&#x27;s &quot;seriousness and his interest in things spiritual (he had discovered Buddhism) were self-evident – as they were in his paintings and drawings).&quot;

==Recordings==
Tear made more than 250 records, and wrote in his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry that he had worked for every major recording company. Roles he sang on disc range from Uriel in Haydn&#x27;s &quot;The Creation&quot; to the painter in Berg&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot;, and from Pitichinaccio in Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; to Sir Harvey in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;. His many classical recordings include performances of Bach, Handel, Monteverdi, Mozart, Beethoven, Mahler, Bruckner, Stravinsky, Janáček, Wagner and Messiaen. In the English canon, he also recorded songs by Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Butterworth and Britten.

<doc id="1239038" wikidata="Q4965345" url="?curid=1239038" title="Brian Sonntag">
<text>Brian S. Sonntag (born December 28, 1951) was the ninth Washington State Auditor. He served five terms, from 1993 until his retirement in 2013. He is a Democrat.

==Personal==
Sonntag was born in 1951 in Tacoma, Washington. He attended Tacoma Community College and the University of Puget Sound. He and his wife Jann live in Tacoma. They have five sons and three grandchildren.

Sonntag has served on the boards of United Way and the Boys and Girls Clubs. He has volunteered for the YMCA and the March of Dimes and has also spent several years coaching youth baseball and basketball teams.

==Public office==
Sonntag was first elected to public office in 1978 as Pierce County Clerk, working as the administrative officer for the Superior Courts. On November 4, 1986, he was elected to the office of Pierce County Auditor, an office his father, Jack W. Sonntag, had held from 1948 to 1969. Following the end of his second term, Sonntag was elected Washington State Auditor on November 3, 1992. He was re-elected four times, most recently in 2008 with 70 percent of the vote.

Sonntag is a Certified Government Financial Manager (CGFM), a designation formally recognized by seven states since its inception in 1994. He has been a member of the Washington Coalition for Open Government, State Productivity Board and the National State Auditors Association&#x27;s Performance Audit Task Force. Although four of the fourteen members of his executive team at the State Auditor&#x27;s Office are CPAs, the fact he is not a CPA has drawn criticism from some of his constituents.

==Tenure==
One of the most publicized issues involving the Auditor&#x27;s Office in 2006 was its performance audit of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). Sonntag&#x27;s office examined the WSDOT&#x27;s inventory and project management, as well as its overall administration and overhead. Always a hot topic of debate, traffic congestion in Seattle caused many commuters to look more closely at what was being done to alleviate the problem. One sign that legislators were attempting to address the problem came in the form of SB 6839. The State Auditor was granted legal authority to conduct performance audits of transportation-related agencies on June 7, 2006, the effective date of Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6839. Section 5.2.c of the bill states, &quot;Fair, independent, comprehensive performance audits of transportation-related agencies overseen by the elected state auditor are essential to improving the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of the state&#x27;s transportation system.&quot; Despite the bill&#x27;s passage, Sonntag faced resistance from the transportation committee as he moved forward with the audit.

==2012 gubernatorial campaign==
On June 13, 2011, Sonntag announced he was considering a run for the 2012 Gubernatorial race. However, on July 5 Sonntag said he had decided not to run for Governor: “The Office of State Auditor continues to be a good fit and the place where I can best contribute and focus on my values.” On June 11, 2012, Sonntag endorsed Republican Attorney General Rob McKenna for Governor and became chairman of Democrats for Rob (D4R).

==Retirement and successor==
In September 2011, Sonntag announced he would retire from the office of State Auditor: &quot;In the past week, I made a difficult decision not to seek re-election as Washington State Auditor in 2012. It was a tough call, but it is the right decision. At the end of my current term, I will have served 20 years in this Office and 40 years in public service – 35 in elected office. Based on what we have accomplished and what we will continue to do on behalf of citizens, the 2012 election is the right time for the Office to transition to new leadership.&quot; He was succeeded by Troy Kelley.

==Recognition==
On May 7, 1999, the Municipal League of King County awarded Sonntag the Warren G. Magnuson Award for &quot;implementing performance measures and the performance audit as constructive management tools for state and local governments, allowing them to operate more efficiently and be more accountable to their constituencies.&quot;

<doc id="1239040" wikidata="Q6824732" url="?curid=1239040" title="Metro Times">
<text>The Detroit Metro Times is a progressive alternative weekly newspaper located in Detroit, Michigan. It is the largest circulating weekly newspaper in the metro Detroit area.

The &quot;Metro Times&quot; was an official sponsor of the now-defunct Detroit Festival of the Arts, where one of the stages is named after it.

== History and content ==
Founded in 1980, the Metro Times since its inception has been supported entirely by advertising and distributed free of charge every Wednesday in newsstands, businesses, and libraries around the city of Detroit and its suburbs. Compared to the two dailies, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; and the &quot;Detroit News&quot;, the &quot;Metro Times&quot; has a liberal orientation, like its later competitor &quot;Real Detroit Weekly&quot;. As of 2014, average circulation for the &quot;Metro Times&quot; was 50,000 weekly and it was available at more than 1,200 locations. Average readership is just over 700,000 weekly.

Its annual &quot;Best of Detroit&quot; survey awards local businesses. The categories include &quot;Public Square&quot; (city life); &quot;Spend the Night&quot; (nightlife and bars); &quot;Nutritional Value&quot; (restaurants and food); and &quot;Real Deal&quot; (retail and other stores).

Syndicated alternative comics run by the &quot;Metro Times&quot; have in the past included &quot;Perry Bible Fellowship&quot;, &quot;This Modern World&quot;, &quot;Eric Monster Millikin&quot; and &quot;Red Meat&quot;. The &quot;Metro Times&quot; also prints Dan Savage&#x27;s &quot;Savage Love&quot; sex advice column (which replaced Isadora Alman&#x27;s &quot;Ask Isadora&quot; sex advice column) and Cal Garrison&#x27;s &quot;Horoscopes&quot; (which replaced Rob Brezsny&#x27;s &quot;Free Will Astrology&quot;). Starting with the January 19–25 issue, the &quot;Metro Times&quot; had its own exclusive crossword, crafted by Brooklyn-based cruciverbalist Ben Tausig, who appears in the documentary &quot;Wordplay&quot;. Editors cut the crossword in May 2008 to save space.

The paper was founded in 1980 by co-publishers Ron Williams and Laura Markham, with Williams as editor and Markham as business manager. In December 2012, Metro Times Editor W. Kim Heron announced his departure. Heron had previously been the paper&#x27;s managing editor. In March 2013, after three months during which Michael Jackman was interim editor, the publisher named Bryan Gottlieb as Editor-in-Chief.

In 2013, Times-Shamrock Communications sold the newspaper to Euclid Media Group. The company dissolved in August 2023 and the sold to Chris Keating, operating under the name Big Lou Holdings LLC.

In April 2014, Valerie Vande Panne, former editor of &quot;High Times,&quot; was named editor-in-chief. In May 2014, the &quot;Metro Times&quot; merged with &quot;Real Detroit Weekly,&quot; which had been a Detroit-area alternative weekly paper since 1999. Dustin Blitchok took over as editor-in-chief in February 2016, before resigning from the position in November of the same year. Former &quot;Metro Times&quot; staff writer and associate editor for &quot;Hour Detroit&quot; Lee DeVito was named editor-in-chief following Blitchok&#x27;s departure.
Euclid Media Group dissolved in August 2023 and the newspaper was sold to Chris Keating, operating under the name Big Lou Holdings LLC.

==Offices==
The headquarters are located in Midtown Detroit. It was previously headquartered in the Detroit Cornice and Slate Company Building in Downtown Detroit. The &quot;Metro Times&quot; moved to the Cornice and Slate building in the 1990s and building owners constructed a wraparound expansion to give the newspaper additional room. In 2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield purchased the Cornice and Slate building, forcing the &quot;Metro Times&quot; to move to a leased space in Ferndale. According to editor-in-chief Lee DeVito, the newspaper intended to eventually return to Detroit. In 2018, the &quot;Metro Times&quot; returned to Detroit, moving into the Arnold E. Frank Building in Midtown.

<doc id="1239041" wikidata="Q488982" url="?curid=1239041" title="Nalubaale Hydroelectric Power Station">
<text>Nalubaale Power Station, formerly known as Owen Falls Dam, is a hydroelectric power station across the White Nile near its source at Lake Victoria in Uganda. &quot;Nalubaale&quot; is the Luganda name for Lake Victoria.

==Location==
The dam sits across the Nile River between the town of Jinja, in Jinja District approximately , by road, east of Kampala, Uganda&#x27;s capital and largest city.

==History==
Before the construction of the dam, water levels on Lake Victoria were moderated by a natural rock dam on the north side of the lake. Rising lake waters would spill over the natural dam into the White Nile, which flows through Uganda, South Sudan, Sudan, and Egypt before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea. When water levels dropped too low, flow into the river ceased.

In 1947, Charles Redvers Westlake, an English engineer, reported to the Colonial Government of Uganda recommending the construction of a hydroelectric dam at Owen Falls near the city of Jinja. This led to the establishment of the Uganda Electricity Board (UEB), with Westlake as its first chairman. A treaty between Uganda and Egypt ensured that the dam would not alter the natural flow of the Nile. The consultant engineer on the project was Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners. Eighty thousand tons of plant and construction materials (including 36,000 tons of cement) were shipped out from Europe in the difficult post-war period. They were then hauled by rail from Mombasa to Jinja. The dam was completed in three years, ahead of schedule in 1954, submerging Ripon Falls.

It supplies electricity to Uganda and parts of neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania. Maintenance and availability of the station declined seriously during the government of Idi Amin.

The rating of the Nalubaale power station is 180 megawatts (MW). Originally it was designed for ten turbines rated at 15 MW each (for a total of 150 MW. The station was refurbished in the 1990s to repair the accumulated wear from a decade of civil disorder. During the repairs, the output power of the generators was increased, bringing the Nalubaale Power Complex&#x27;s generating capacity to 180 MW.

==Operations==
The Uganda Government, through the Uganda Electricity Generation Company (UEGCL), a 100 percent parastatal, awarded a 20-year operational, management and maintenance concession to Eskom Uganda Limited, a subsidiary of Eskom, the South African energy company, to cover both Nalubaale Power Station and the adjacent Kiira Power Station. The concession agreement commenced in 2002. The electricity generated here, is sold to the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL), the authorized single buyer. UETCL in turn sells the power to Umeme, the energy distributor.

On 31 March 2023, the 20-year concession with Eskom for both dams expired and was not renewed. Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) took over the management of the power stations and absorbed 93 percent of Eskom Uganda staff, effective 1 April 2023.

==Maintenance==
In 2021, Eskom Uganda Limited hired &quot;Babcon Uganda Limited&quot; at a cost of USh888 million (approx. US$251,000) to repair and strengthen the powerhouse staircase to Units 1, 5 and 9. The deterioration of the staircase is blamed on Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR), which results when water reacts with concrete, over time, causing expansion of the concrete and loosening of attached hardware.

In September the same year, Sinohydro Corporation Limited completed renovations to the dam&#x27;s structure. The repairs that lasted nearly one year, were meant to stop water leakages due to &quot;deterioration of grout curtain&quot;. It is expected that the repairs, last carried out in 1999, will give the dam at least another 20 years of life. The repairs cost USh11.6 billion (US$3.3 million).

In September 2022, Eskom Uganda spent UGX:6.84 billion (approx. US$1.8 million) to replace three of the ten generator transformers. The transformers to units 3, 5 and 6 &quot;were past their service life expectancy&quot; and were replaced. The transformers from units 1 to 4, step up voltage from 11kV to 33kV, while those from units 5 to 10 step up voltage from 11kV to 132kV. The power at high voltage is then transmitted across the grid. Transmission of power at high voltage over long distances reduces power losses.

==Owen Falls Extension==
In 1993 work started on the Owen Falls Extension project, a second powerhouse located about 1 km from the 1954 powerhouse. A new power canal was cut to bring water from Lake Victoria to the new powerhouse. Major construction was completed in 1999 with first power from the project from two units in 2000. The extension has space for five hydroelectric turbine generators with four installed as of 2001. Each unit at the extension has a capacity of 40 megawatts. During official opening ceremonies in 2003, the extension was named the Kiira Power Station. Design and project management of the extension project was by Acres International of Canada, now known as Hatch Limited.

Eskom Uganda operates Nalubaale Power Station as a concessionaire. They regularly clear debris water hyacinth from the intakes of the stations. Further downstream, the 250 MW Bujagali Hydroelectric Power Station was constructed between 2007 and 2012.

==Lake Victoria water levels==
Since January 2006, hydroelectric generation at Nalubaale and Kiira stations has been curtailed due to a prolonged drought and low level of water in Lake Victoria. The hydrology of Lake Victoria has unusual features.

In 2006 there was a release of secret documents from 1956 in Britain that indicated the British had considered using this dam to reduce the water in the Nile in an effort to remove Egyptian President Nasser. The plan was not carried out because it would have seasonally flooded land in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, reduced flows to a trickle in Sudan and the effect of shutting off the White Nile even to coincide with the seasonal lull in the Blue Nile would not have affected Egypt for at least 16 months. Veto power over construction projects on the Nile River and its tributaries was granted to Egypt by the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1929, reinforced by the bilateral agreement between Egypt and Sudan signed in 1959. In 1959 upriver Nile states such as Uganda denounced this treaty purportedly claiming virtually all of the waters of the Nile to themselves and leaving none to the upriver states. The countries along the White Nile excluding Sudan seek to create a unified international legal framework for the basin and for the time being respect keeping lake levels virtually unaltered so as not to upset their own eco-systems and established patterns of crop production and livestock raising.

==Developments==
In October 2024, Jan Sadek, the ambassador of the European Union  to Uganda, announced an economic package valued at €170 million (UGX:680 billion), to rehabilitate, stabilize and prolong the life of both Nalubaale and Kiira dams. Of the total, €30 million is a grant from the EU to the government of Uganda. The remaining €140 million is a concessional loan from the European Investment Bank and the French Development Agency (FDA).

<doc id="1239047" wikidata="Q620760" url="?curid=1239047" title="Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome">
<text>Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a condition characterized by an abnormally large increase in heart rate upon sitting up or standing. POTS is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system that can lead to a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, brain fog, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, headaches, heart palpitations, exercise intolerance, nausea, diminished concentration, tremulousness (shaking), syncope (fainting), coldness or pain in the extremities, numbness or tingling in the extremities, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Other conditions associated with POTS include myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine headaches, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, asthma, autoimmune disease, vasovagal syncope, and mast cell activation syndrome. POTS symptoms may be treated with lifestyle changes such as increasing fluid, electrolyte, and salt intake, wearing compression stockings, gentle and slow postural changes, avoiding prolonged bedrest, medication, and physical therapy.
The causes of POTS are varied. It may develop after a viral infection, surgery, trauma, autoimmune disease, or pregnancy. It has been shown to emerge in previously healthy patients after COVID-19, or possibly in rare cases after COVID-19 vaccination, though causative evidence is limited and further study is needed. POTS is more common among people who got infected with SARS-CoV-2 than among those who got vaccinated against COVID-19. Risk factors include a family history of the condition. POTS in adults is characterized by a heart rate increase of 30 beats per minute within ten minutes of standing up, accompanied by other symptoms. This increased heart rate should occur in the absence of orthostatic hypotension (&gt;20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure) to be considered POTS. A spinal fluid leak (called spontaneous intracranial hypotension) may have the same signs and symptoms as POTS and should be excluded. Prolonged bedrest may lead to multiple symptoms, including blood volume loss and postural tachycardia. Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as dehydration, orthostatic hypotension, heart problems, adrenal insufficiency, epilepsy, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, must not be present.
Treatment may include:

* avoiding factors that bring on symptoms, 
* increasing dietary salt and water, 
* small and frequent meals, 
* avoidance of immobilization, 
* wearing compression stockings, and 
* medication. Medications used may include:
** beta blockers, 
** pyridostigmine, 
** midodrine and
** fludrocortisone.

More than 50% of patients whose condition was triggered by a viral infection get better within five years. About 80% of patients have symptomatic improvement with treatment, while 25% are so disabled they are unable to work. A retrospective study on patients with adolescent-onset has shown that five years after diagnosis, 19% of patients had full resolution of symptoms.

It is estimated that 1–3 million people in the United States have POTS. The average age for POTS onset is 20, and it occurs about five times more frequently in females than in males.

==Signs and symptoms==

POTS is a complex and multifaceted clinical disorder, the etiology and management of which remain incompletely understood. This syndrome is typified by a diverse array of nonspecific symptoms, making it a challenging condition to describe.

Individuals living with POTS experience a diminished quality of life compared to healthy individuals, due to disruptions in various domains such as standing, playing sports, symptom anxiety, and impacts on school, work, or spiritual (religious) domains—these disruptions affect their daily life and overall well-being.

In adults, the primary manifestation is an increase in heart rate of more than 30 beats per minute within ten minutes of standing up. The resulting heart rate is typically more than 120 beats per minute. For people between ages 12 and 19, the minimum increase for a POTS diagnosis is 40 beats per minute. POTS is often accompanied by common features of orthostatic intolerance—in which symptoms that develop while upright are relieved by reclining. These orthostatic symptoms include palpitations, light-headedness, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, weakness or &quot;heaviness&quot; in the lower legs, blurred vision, and cognitive difficulties. Symptoms may be exacerbated with prolonged sitting, prolonged standing, alcohol, heat, exercise, or eating a large meal.

POTS and dysautonomia often presents with narrowed pulse pressures. In some cases, patients experience a drop in pulse pressure to 0 mm Hg upon standing, rendering them practically pulseless while upright. This condition leads to significant morbidity, as many affected individuals struggle to remain standing.

Up to one-third of POTS patients experience fainting for many reasons, including but not limited to standing, physical exertion, or heat exposure. POTS patients may also experience orthostatic headaches. Some POTS patients may develop blood pooling in the extremities, characterized by a reddish-purple color of the legs and/or hands upon standing. 48% of people with POTS report chronic fatigue and 32% report sleep disturbances. Other POTS patients only exhibit the cardinal symptom of orthostatic tachycardia. Additional signs and symptoms are varied, and may include excessive sweating, lack of sweating, heat intolerance, digestive issues such as nausea, indigestion, constipation or diarrhea, post-exertional malaise, coat-hanger pain, brain fog, and syncope or presyncope.

Whereas POTS is primarily characterized by its profound impact on the autonomic and cardiovascular systems, it can lead to substantial functional impairment. This impairment, often manifesting as symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and sleep disturbances, can significantly diminish the patient&#x27;s quality of life.

=== Brain fog ===
One of the most disabling and prevalent symptoms in POTS is &quot;brain fog&quot;, a term used by patients to describe the cognitive difficulties they experience. In one survey of 138 POTS patients, brain fog was defined as &quot;forgetful&quot; (91%), &quot;difficulty thinking&quot; (89%), and &quot;difficulty focusing&quot; (88%). Other common descriptions were &quot;difficulty processing what others say&quot; (80%), &quot;confusion&quot; (71%), &quot;getting lost&quot; (64%), and &quot;thoughts moving too quickly&quot; (40%). The same survey described the most common triggers of brain fog to be fatigue (91%), lack of sleep (90%), prolonged standing (87%), and dehydration (86%).

Neuropsychological testing has shown that a POTS patient has reduced attention (Ruff 2&amp;7 speed and WAIS-III digits forward), short-term memory (WAIS-III digits back), cognitive processing speed (symbol digits modalities test), and executive function (Stroop word color and trails B).

A potential cause for brain fog is a decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF), especially in upright position.

There may be a loss of neurovascular coupling and reduced functional hyperemia in response to cognitive challenge under orthostatic stress – perhaps related to a loss of autoregulatory buffering of beat-by-beat fluctuations in arterial blood flow.

===Co-morbidities===
Conditions that are commonly reported with POTS include:
* Migraine headaches (40%)
* Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (18–25%)
* Asthma (20%)
* Autoimmune disease (16%)
* Vasovagal syncope (13%)
* Mast cell activation disorder (9%)

==Causes==
The pathophysiology of POTS is not attributable to a single cause or unified hypothesis—it is the result of multiple interacting mechanisms, each contributing to the overall clinical presentation; the mechanisms may include autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, deconditioning, hyperadrenergic states, etc.

The symptoms of POTS can be caused by several distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. These mechanisms are poorly understood, and can overlap, with many patients showing features of multiple POTS types. Many people with POTS exhibit low blood volume (hypovolemia), which can decrease the rate of blood flow to the heart. To compensate for low blood volume, the heart increases its cardiac output by beating faster (reflex tachycardia), leading to the symptoms of presyncope.

In the 30% to 60% of cases classified as &quot;hyperadrenergic POTS&quot;, norepinephrine levels are elevated on standing, often due to hypovolemia or partial autonomic neuropathy. A smaller minority of people with POTS have (typically very high) standing norepinephrine levels that are elevated even in the absence of hypovolemia and autonomic neuropathy; this is classified as &quot;central hyperadrenergic POTS&quot;. The high norepinephrine levels contribute to symptoms of tachycardia. Another subtype, &quot;neuropathic POTS&quot;, is associated with denervation of sympathetic nerves in the lower limbs. In this subtype, it is thought that impaired constriction of the blood vessels causes blood to pool in the veins of the lower limbs. Heart rate increases to compensate for this blood pooling.

A subset of POTS patients have markedly reduced myocardial MIBG reuptake via MIBG myocardial scintigraphy, interpreted to be a potential manifestation of autonomic cardiac neuropathy, although reduced expression of the norepinephrine transporter may also result in impaired MIBG reuptake and has been implicated in POTS.

In up to 50% of cases, there was an onset of symptoms following a viral illness. It may also be linked to physical trauma, concussion, pregnancy, surgery or psychosocial stress. It is believed that these events could act as a trigger for an autoimmune response that result in POTS. It has been shown to emerge in previously healthy patients after COVID-19, or after COVID-19 vaccination. A 2023 review found that the chances of being diagnosed with POTS within 90 days after mRNA vaccination were 1.33 times higher compared to 90 days before vaccination, still, the results are inconclusive due to a small sample size; only 12 cases of newly diagnosed POTS after mRNA vaccination were reported, all these 12 patients having autoimmune antibodies. However, the risk of POTS-related diagnoses was 5.35 times higher after getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to after mRNA vaccination. Possible mechanisms for COVID-induced POTS are hypovolemia, autoimmunity/inflammation from antibody production against autonomic nerve fibers, and direct toxic effects of COVID-19, or secondary sympathetic nervous system stimulation.

POTS is more common in females than males. POTS also has been linked to patients with a history of autoimmune diseases, long Covid, irritable bowel syndrome, anemia, hyperthyroidism, fibromyalgia, diabetes, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and cancer. Genetics likely plays a role, with one study finding that one in eight POTS patients reported a history of orthostatic intolerance in their family.

Physical deconditioning may be a factor involved in POTS. Strong parallels have been found between POTS and strong physical deconditioning or people who have undergone prolonged periods of bed rest. Both POTS and deconditioning are marked by cardiac atrophy, reduced blood volume, and other physical changes. There are also similarities between POTS and deconditioning in response to exercise.
There are however distinct differences between classic cardiovascular deconditioning and POTS in most cases 

There appears to be some overlap between POTS and certain other conditions like chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia.

=== Autoimmunity ===
There is an increasing number of studies indicating that POTS is an autoimmune disease. A high number of patients has elevated levels of autoantibodies against the α1-adrenergic receptor and against the muscarinic acetylcholine M4 receptor.

Elevations of autoantibodies targeting the α1-adrenergic receptor has been associated with symptoms severity in patients with POTS.

More recently, autoantibodies against other targets have been identified in small cohorts of POTS patients. Signs of innate immune system activation with elaboration of pro-inflammatory cytokines has also been reported in a cohort of POTS patients. Studies suggest the involvement of adrenergic, cholinergic, and angiotensin II type I autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of orthostatic intolerance, so that these autoantibodies are thought to interfere with the normal functioning of the autonomic nervous system, leading to the symptoms observed in POTS; as such, there is growing interest in the use of immunomodulation therapy as a potential treatment strategy for POTS: immunomodulation therapy aims to regulate or normalize the immune response, thereby reducing the production of harmful autoantibodies.

=== Secondary POTS ===
If POTS is caused by another condition, it may be classified as &quot;secondary POTS&quot;. Chronic diabetes mellitus is one common cause. POTS can also be secondary to gastrointestinal disorders that are associated with low fluid intake due to nausea or fluid loss through diarrhea, leading to hypovolemia. Systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases have also been linked to POTS.

There is a subset of patients who present with both POTS and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), and it is not yet clear whether MCAS is a secondary cause of POTS or simply comorbid, however, treating MCAS for these patients can significantly improve POTS symptoms.

POTS can also co-occur in all types of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), a hereditary connective tissue disorder marked by loose hypermobile joints prone to subluxations and dislocations, skin that exhibits moderate or greater laxity, easy bruising, and many other symptoms. A trifecta of POTS, EDS, and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is becoming increasingly more common, with a genetic marker common among all three conditions. POTS is also often accompanied by vasovagal syncope, with a 25% overlap being reported. There are some overlaps between POTS and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), with evidence of POTS in 10–20% of ME/CFS cases. Fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance are prominent symptoms of both conditions, and dysautonomia may underlie both conditions.

POTS can sometimes be a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with cancer.

There have also been reports of patients experiencing co-occurring POTS, May-Thurner Syndrome, and EDS.

There are case reports of people developing POTS and other forms of dysautonomia post-COVID. There is no good large-scale empirical evidence yet to prove a connection, so for now the evidence is preliminary.

==Diagnosis==

POTS is a complex disorder with a multifactorial etiology, and the diagnostics of POTS is challenging.

POTS is most commonly diagnosed by a cardiologist (41%), cardiac electrophysiologist (15%), or neurologist (19%). The average number of physicians seen before receiving diagnosis is seven, and the average delay before diagnosis is 4.7 years.

=== Diagnostic criteria ===
A POTS diagnosis requires the following characteristics:

* For patients age 20 or older, a sustained increase in heart rate ≥30 bpm within ten minutes of upright posture (tilt table test or standing) from a supine position.
** For patients age 12–19, heart rate increase must be &gt;40 bpm.
* Associated with frequent symptoms of lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, or fatigue that are worse with upright posture and that improve with recumbence.
* An absence of orthostatic hypotension (i.e. no sustained systolic blood pressure drop of 20 mmHg or more).
* Chronic symptoms that have lasted for longer than three months.
* In the absence of other disorders, medications, or functional states that are known to predispose to orthostatic tachycardia.

Alternative tests to the tilt table test are also used, such as the NASA Lean Test and the adapted Autonomic Profile (aAP) which require less equipment to complete. Nonpostural testing, such as the Valsalva maneuver, which may minimize the triggering of POTS symptoms, can be used prior to or in conjunction with the aforementioned techniques as a potential indicator of orthostatic intolerance, including POTS.

===Orthostatic intolerance===
An increase in heart rate upon moving to an upright posture is known as orthostatic (upright) tachycardia (fast heart rate). It occurs without any coinciding drop in blood pressure, as that would indicate orthostatic hypotension. Certain medications to treat POTS may cause orthostatic hypotension. It is accompanied by other features of orthostatic intolerance—symptoms that develop in an upright position and are relieved by reclining. These orthostatic symptoms include palpitations, light-headedness, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, weakness or &quot;heaviness&quot; in the lower legs, blurred vision, and cognitive difficulties.

=== Differential diagnoses ===
A variety of autonomic tests are employed to exclude autonomic disorders that could underlie symptoms, while endocrine testing is used to exclude hyperthyroidism and rarer endocrine conditions. Electrocardiography is normally performed on all patients to exclude other possible causes of tachycardia. In cases where a particular associated condition or complicating factor are suspected, other non-autonomic tests may be used: echocardiography to exclude mitral valve prolapse, and thermal threshold tests for small-fiber neuropathy.

Testing the cardiovascular response to prolonged head-up tilting, exercise, eating, and heat stress may help determine the best strategy for managing symptoms. POTS has also been divided into several types (see § Causes), which may benefit from distinct treatments. People with neuropathic POTS show a loss of sweating in the feet during sweat tests, as well as impaired norepinephrine release in the leg, but not arm. This is believed to reflect peripheral sympathetic denervation in the lower limbs. People with hyperadrenergic POTS show a marked increase of blood pressure and norepinephrine levels when standing, and are more likely to have from prominent palpitations, anxiety, and tachycardia.

People with POTS can be misdiagnosed with inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) as they present similarly. One distinguishing feature is those with POTS rarely exhibit &gt;100 bpm while in a supine position, while patients with IST often have a resting heart rate &gt;100 bpm. Additionally patients with POTS display a more pronounced change in heart rate in response to postural change.

==Treatment==
Despite numerous therapeutic interventions proposed for the management of POTS, none have received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for this indication, and no effective treatment strategies have been identified that would have been confirmed by large clinical trials.

POTS treatment involves using multiple methods in combination to counteract cardiovascular dysfunction, address symptoms, and simultaneously address any associated disorders. For most patients, water intake should be increased, especially after waking, in order to expand blood volume (reducing hypovolemia). Eight to ten cups of water daily are recommended. Increasing salt intake, by adding salt to food, taking salt tablets, or drinking sports drinks and other electrolyte solutions is an effective way to raise blood pressure by helping the body retain water. Different physicians recommend different amounts of sodium to their patients. Combining these techniques with gradual physical training enhances their effect. In some cases, when increasing oral fluids and salt intake is not enough, intravenous saline or the drug desmopressin is used to help increase fluid retention.

Large meals worsen symptoms for some people. These people may benefit from eating small meals frequently throughout the day instead. Alcohol and food high in carbohydrates can also exacerbate symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. Excessive consumption of caffeine beverages should be avoided, because they can promote urine production (leading to fluid loss) and consequently hypovolemia. Exposure to extreme heat may also aggravate symptoms.

Prolonged physical inactivity can worsen the symptoms of POTS. POTS may be caused or exacerbated by deconditioning. Techniques that increase a person&#x27;s capacity for exercise, such as endurance training or graded exercise therapy, can relieve symptoms for some patients. Exercise programs can be very effective and can lead to remission in many people with POTS. Aerobic exercise performed for 20 minutes a day, three times a week, is sometimes recommended for patients who can tolerate it. Exercise may have the immediate effect of worsening tachycardia, especially after a meal or on a hot day. In these cases, it may be easier to exercise in a semi-reclined position, such as riding a recumbent bicycle, rowing, or swimming. Although exercise may be difficult initially, it becomes progressively easier as physical conditioning improves.

When changing to an upright posture, finishing a meal, or concluding exercise, a sustained hand grip can briefly raise the blood pressure, possibly reducing symptoms. Compression garments can also be of benefit by constricting blood pressures with external body pressure.

Aggravating factors include exertion (81%), continued standing (80%), heat (79%), and after meals (42%).

===Medication===
If non-pharmacological methods are ineffective, medication may be necessary. Medications used may include beta blockers, pyridostigmine, midodrine, or fludrocortisone, among others. As of 2013, no medication has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat POTS, but a variety are used off-label. Their efficacy has not yet been examined in long-term randomized controlled trials.

Fludrocortisone, a mineralocorticoid, may be used to enhance sodium retention and blood volume, which may be beneficial not only by augmenting sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction, but also because a large subset of POTS patients appear to have low absolute blood volume. However, fludrocortisone may cause hypokalemia (low potassium levels).

While people with POTS typically have normal or even elevated arterial blood pressure, the neuropathic form of POTS is presumed to constitute a selective sympathetic venous denervation. In these patients the selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist midodrine may increase venous return, enhance stroke volume, and improve symptoms. Midodrine should only be taken during the daylight hours as it may promote supine hypertension.

Sinus node blocker ivabradine can successfully restrain heart rate in POTS without affecting blood pressure, demonstrated in approximately 60% of people with POTS treated in an open-label trial of ivabradine experienced symptom improvement.

Pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and parasympathomimetic, has been reported to restrain heart rate and improve chronic symptoms in approximately half of people. However, it may cause GI side effects that limit its use in around 20% of its patient population.

The selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine has been used successfully to enhance venous return and stroke volume in some people with POTS. However, this medication may be hampered by poor oral bioavailability. Indirectly acting sympathomimetics, like the norepinephrine releasing agents ephedrine and pseudoephedrine and the norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors methylphenidate and bupropion, have also been used in the treatment of POTS. The norepinephrine prodrug droxidopa has been used as well.

==Prognosis==
POTS has a favorable prognosis when managed appropriately. Symptoms improve within five years of diagnosis for many patients, and 60% return to their original level of functioning. Approximately 90% of people with POTS respond to a combination of pharmacological and physical treatments. Those who develop POTS in their early to mid teens will likely respond well to a combination of physical methods as well as pharmacotherapy. Outcomes are more guarded for adults newly diagnosed with POTS. Some people do not recover, and a few even worsen with time. The hyperadrenergic type of POTS typically requires continuous therapy. If POTS is caused by another condition, outcomes depend on the prognosis of the underlying disorder.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence of POTS is unknown. One study estimated a minimal rate of 170 POTS cases per 100,000 individuals, but the true prevalence is likely higher due to underdiagnosis. Another study estimated that there are at least 500,000 cases in the United States. POTS is more common in women than men, with a female-to-male ratio of 4:1. Most people with POTS are aged between 20 and 40, with an average onset of 21. Diagnoses of POTS beyond age 40 are rare, perhaps because symptoms improve with age.

As recently stated, up to one-third of POTS patients also present with Vasovagal Syncope (VVS).  This ratio is probably higher if pre-Syncope patients, patients that report the symptoms of Syncope without overt fainting, were included.  Given the difficulty with current autonomic measurements in quantitatively isolating and differentiating Parasympathetic (Vagal) activity from Sympathetic activity without assumption or approximation, the current direction of research and clinical assessment is understandable:  perpetuating uncertainty regarding underlying cause, prescribing beta-blockers and proper daily hydration as the only therapy, not addressing the orthostatic dysfunction as the underlying cause, and recommending acceptance and associated lifestyle changes to cope. 

Direct measures of Parasympathetic (Vagal) activity obviates the uncertainty and lack of true relief of POTS as well as VVS.  For example, the hypothesis that POTS is an auto-immune disorder may be an indication that a significant number of POTS cases are indeed co-morbid with VVS.  Remember the Parasympathetic Nervous System is the memory for, and controls and coordinates, the immune system.  If Parasympathetic (Vagal) over-, or prolonged-, activation is chronic then portions of the immune system may remain active beyond the limits of the infection.  Given that portions of the immune system are not of self, these portions remain active and continue to &quot;feed.&quot;  Once the only source of &quot;feed&quot; is self, the immune system begins to attack the host.  This is the definition of autoimmune.  This is a counter-hypothesis that may provide a simpler explanation with a more immediate plan for therapy and relief.  For it may be that relieving the Vagal over-activation, will retires the self-attacking portion of the immune system, thereby relieving the autoimmunity.

Another example may be &quot;Hyperadrenergic POTS.&quot;  A counter hypothesis and perhaps a simpler explanation that leads to more direct therapy and improved outcomes is again the fact that POTS and VVS may be co-morbid.  It is well known that Parasympathetic (Vagal) over-activation may cause secondary Sympathetic over-activation.  Without direct Parasympathetic (Vagal) measures, the resulting assumption is that the secondary Sympathetic over-activation (the definition of &quot;hyperadrenergic&quot;) is actually the primary autonomic dysfunction.  Simply treating the (secondary) Sympathetic over-activation may be just treating a symptom in these cases, which may work for a while but then the body compensates and more medication is needed or the patient become unresponsive and the permanent degraded lifestyles are considered the only option.  Again, this is unfortunate.  Given that cases of POTS with VVS involves different portions of the nervous system (Parasympathetic and Sympathetic), and that both branches may be treated simultaneously, albeit differently, true relief of both conditions, as needed, is quite possible, and the cases of these newer hypothesized causes may be relieved with current, less expensive, and shorter-term therapy modalities.

==Research directions==
A key area for further exploration of POTS management is the autonomic nervous system and its response to the orthostatic challenge. The autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis during changes in posture. A deeper understanding of its function and the alterations that occur in POTS could provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets and the mechanisms of POTS treatment.

==History==
In 1871, physician Jacob Mendes Da Costa described a condition that resembled the modern concept of POTS. He named it &quot;irritable heart syndrome&quot;. Cardiologist Thomas Lewis expanded on the description, coining the term &quot;soldier&#x27;s heart&quot; because it was often found among military personnel. The condition came to be known as Da Costa&#x27;s syndrome, which is now recognized as several distinct disorders, including POTS.

&quot;Postural tachycardia syndrome&quot; was coined in 1982 in a description of a patient who had postural tachycardia, but not orthostatic hypotension. Ronald Schondorf and Phillip A. Low of the Mayo Clinic first used the name &quot;postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome&quot;, POTS, in 1993.

==Notable cases==
British politician Nicola Blackwood revealed in March 2015 that she had been diagnosed with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome in 2013 and that she had later been diagnosed with POTS. She was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Life Science by Prime Minister Theresa May in 2019 and given a life peerage that enabled her to take a seat in Parliament. As a junior minister, it is her responsibility to answer questions in parliament on the subjects of Health and departmental business. When answering these questions, it is customary for ministers to sit when listening to the question and then to rise to give an answer from the despatch box, thus standing up and sitting down numerous times in quick succession throughout a series of questions. On 17 June 2019, she fainted during one of these questioning sessions after standing up from a sitting position four times in the space of twelve minutes, and it was suggested that her POTS was a factor in her fainting. Asked about the incident, she stated: &quot;I was frustrated and embarrassed my body gave up on me at work ... But I am grateful it gives me a chance to shine a light on a condition many others are also living with.&quot;

In 2024, Taiwanese tennis player Latisha Chan revealed that she was diagnosed with POTS back in 2014 and has been receiving treatments before Summer Olympics as well. Her condition was considered career-threatening, but has had her career extended by over a decade due to external counterpulsation.

In her 2024 memoir &quot;Just Add Water&quot;, Olympic gold medalist swimmer Katie Ledecky shared that she has a mild form of POTS.

<text>Klaus Hermann Wilhelm Tennstedt (; June 6, 1926 – January 11, 1998) was a German conductor from Merseburg. Known for his interpretation of the Austro-German repertoire, especially his sympathetic approaches towards Gustav Mahler, Tennstedt is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential conductors of the late 20th century. He worked with the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, the NDR Symphony Orchestra, and other highly regarded ensembles such as the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and most notably the London Philharmonic Orchestra, with which he was closely associated and recorded many of his celebrated recordings under the EMI label, including a cycle of Mahler&#x27;s 10 symphonies.

==Life and career==

He studied violin and piano at the Leipzig Conservatory. He avoided military service during the Nazi era by joining a Baroque orchestra. He became concertmaster of the Halle Municipal Theater orchestra in 1948, but a finger injury ended his career as a violinist and he continued as a voice coach at the same theater. Tennstedt then directed his talents toward conducting. In 1958, he became music director of the Dresden Opera, and in 1962, music director of the Schwerin State Orchestra and Theatre.

He emigrated from East Germany in 1971, obtaining asylum in Sweden. He conducted in Gothenburg at the Göteborg Theater, and in Stockholm with the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra. In 1972, he became General Music Director of the Kiel Opera in northern Germany. From 1979 to 1981, he was chief conductor of the North German Radio Symphony Orchestra (NDR Symphony) in Hamburg, and during the same period (1979–82) was principal guest conductor of the Minnesota Orchestra in Minneapolis.

In 1974, Tennstedt made his North American debut with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. His first U.S. appearance was shortly after that, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, on December 13, 1974, conducting an all-Brahms program. The following week, his BSO Bruckner &quot;Symphony No. 8&quot; earned laudatory reviews. In Norman Lebrecht&#x27;s &quot;The Maestro Myth&quot;, the story was told that when the Boston management asked Tennstedt what he wanted to conduct, he replied: &quot;You mean I get to choose?&quot; His appearances were so highly acclaimed that as a result, Tennstedt was invited to guest-conduct at the Tanglewood Music Festival and Blossom Music Festival in 1975.

His only American opera engagement was a series of seven performances of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, the last of which, on January 7, 1984, was broadcast. 
Tennstedt then guest-conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony, the Cincinnati Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the New York Philharmonic. In Europe, he guest- conducted the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Bavarian Radio Symphony of Munich, the Berlin Philharmonic and the SDR Symphony (now the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra).

His London debut was with the London Symphony (LSO) in 1976. In 1977 came his first engagement with the London Philharmonic (LPO), which led to his appointment as its principal guest conductor in 1980, and eventually as principal conductor in 1983. Due to ill-health he resigned in 1987, but was later named its conductor laureate, returning to the LPO in 1986 to record Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 8 (&quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot;, EMI DSB-47625) and for Mahler concerts in November 1991 (Symphony No. 6) and May 1993 (Symphony No. 7). His last guest appearance in the U.S. was with the New York Philharmonic in 1992, but on the advice of his physicians he retired from conducting altogether in October 1994. The last time he conducted was in June 1994, at a rehearsal of a student orchestra at Oxford University, where he received an honorary doctorate a few days later. He died of throat cancer in January 1998, at his home in Kiel, Germany. 

In 1978 Tennstedt became the first German conductor of his generation to conduct the Israel Philharmonic, which until then had boycotted German conductors because of their connections with the Nazi regime.

His recordings include a complete cycle of the symphonies of Gustav Mahler, and several of Tennstedt&#x27;s concert performances have been reissued on CD.

<text>The University of Charleston (UC) is a private university with its main campus in Charleston, West Virginia. It also has a location in Beckley, West Virginia, known as UC-Beckley.

==History==
The school was founded in 1888 as the Barboursville Seminary of the Southern Methodist Church. In 1901, it was renamed Morris Harvey College, in honor of a devoted supporter.

In 1935 the school moved to downtown Charleston and affiliated with the Mason College of Fine Arts and Music. In 1940, it became independent of the Methodist Church. In 1947, the school moved to its present campus in the Kanawha City section of Charleston across the river from the State Capitol. In 1951, it purchased the Young-Noyes House as the home of the college president. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The college fell on hard times after the end of the military draft and college deferment during the Vietnam War and offered itself to the state in 1975, which refused the gift. In December 1978, the school changed its name to the University of Charleston. Beginning with the inauguration of President Dr. Edwin H. Welch in 1989, the school has undergone a physical and academic transformation. Four new residence halls, a parking garage, a fitness center, an academic building housing the library, computer and science labs, and a new school of pharmacy have been built since 1998.

UC established campuses on Mountain State University&#x27;s former Beckley and Martinsburg, West Virginia, locations on January 1, 2013. UC later vacated the former MSU Martinsburg campus (the property was sold to a third-party buyer, and established a new location in Martinsburg, known as UC-Martinsburg. UC vacated the former MSU Beckley campus after the 2014–15 academic year and established a new campus in Beckley.

On December 15, 2017, the board of trustees named Martin S. Roth to succeed Dr. Edwin Welch as the president of the university. He began on June 30, 2018. Roth left his position as the dean of the business school at the University of Hartford.

==Academics==
The University of Charleston is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

There are over twenty undergraduate major programs at UC, including fields such as business, communications, education, nursing, exercise science, organizational leadership, sport administration, radiologic science, and digital media design. 

===Graduate schools===
In 2006, UC opened its first doctoral program, the UC School of Pharmacy. UC now also offers an online doctoral program through its School of Leadership, the Doctor of Executive Leadership (DEL). In 2008, the university opened a graduate business school which grants four business master&#x27;s degrees: Master of Business Administration and Leadership (MBAL), Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA), Executive Master of Business Administration with a concentration in Pharmaceutical &amp; Healthcare Management (EMBA- PHM), and Executive Master of Forensic Accounting (EMFA).

In 2012, the school announced a new Physician Assistant program.

==Athletics==
UC&#x27;s athletic teams, known as the Golden Eagles, mostly compete in the Mountain East Conference (MEC) in NCAA Division II. In June 2012, UC was one of nine members of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) that announced their plans to leave to form a new Division II conference. Two months later, the new conference was unveiled as the MEC, with UC as one of 12 charter members. The men&#x27;s volleyball team, which was elevated from a club team to full varsity status for the 2015 season (2014–15 school year), plays at the National Collegiate (Division I/II) level; after playing in 2015 as an independent, it joined the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association. University of Charleston achieved its first Division II national championship in men&#x27;s soccer in 2017 defeating Lynn University in the finals.

In 2005, UC entered into a partnership with the local school board to refurbish the school board–owned Laidley Field, which was renamed University of Charleston Stadium. The campus also boasts new or renovated softball, football, baseball, and soccer fields, and competes in 18 Division II sports.

<doc id="1239055" wikidata="Q7925603" url="?curid=1239055" title="Victims' Rights Amendment">
<text>In the United States, the Victims&#x27; Rights Amendment is a provision which has been included in some states&#x27; constitutions, proposed for other states, and additionally has been proposed for inclusion in the United States Constitution. Its provisions vary from state to state but are usually somewhat similar. There are likewise competing versions of the proposed federal amendment.

==The Victims&#x27; Rights Movement==
The Victims&#x27; Rights Movement began as a response to the spread of two beliefs. The first was the perception that the legal system was more concerned with the protection of the constitutional rights of criminal offenders and alleged offenders than they were the victims of their offenses. This was especially inflamed by numerous lawsuits alleging unconstitutional conditions in many U.S. jails and prisons, and a strong emphasis on the education and rehabilitation of those who were incarcerated, especially beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s. Advocates of the movement wanted to see affirmative help for crime victims to be at least as extensive as that provided to the offenders, and for victims to receive compensation from offenders whenever this was practicable. The second stimulus was the spread of the belief, bolstered by prominent stories in the media, that the number of released or paroled offenders returning to attack their original victims or victims&#x27; families was increasing, in some cases in retaliation for having reported the original offense.

Most states&#x27; victims&#x27; rights amendments provide for the prosecutors to stay in touch with the victims and their families during all stages of prosecution, and to stay in touch with them post-conviction to advise them of events such as parole hearings, applications for pardons or other forms of executive clemency or relief, and similar news. They may require that any pay received by an offender while incarcerated go at least in part to compensate the victims, and that royalties to any creative works such as books, screenplays or similar works created by the offender judged to be derived from the events of the offense be assigned to the victims (though these latter requirements have been challenged as a violation of the constitutional guarantee of free speech).

==The Federal Amendment==

The federal victims&#x27; rights amendments which have been proposed are similar to the above. The primary contention, and perhaps the main reason that to this point they remain only proposals, is whether they will apply only to federal offenses and the federal system or will mandate all states to adopt similar provisions (the version advocated by at least one very high-profile advocate, John Walsh, host of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;). This second version is offensive to many otherwise conservative &quot;law and order&quot; members of United States Congress because they deem it to be violative of another principle important to conservatives, that of federalism. Advocates of both sides are adamant on their version, and for this reason neither has been passed by either house of Congress .

==Text of the Victims&#x27; Rights Amendment==
House Joint Resolution 106, introduced on March 26, 2012, by Reps. Trent Franks (R-AZ 02) and Jim Costa (D-CA 20), failed to pass committee or be voted on. The bill reads as follows:
:&quot;Section 1. The rights of a crime victim to fairness, respect, and dignity, being capable of protection without denying the constitutional rights of the accused, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State. The crime victim shall, moreover, have the rights to reasonable notice of, and shall not be excluded from, public proceedings relating to the offense, to be heard at any release, plea, sentencing, or other such proceeding involving any right established by this article, to proceedings free from unreasonable delay, to reasonable notice of the release or escape of the accused, to due consideration of the crime victim&#x27;s safety, and to restitution. The crime victim or the crime victim&#x27;s lawful representative has standing to fully assert and enforce these rights in any court. Nothing in this article provides grounds for a new trial or any claim for damages and no person accused of the conduct described in section 2 of this article may obtain any form of relief.&quot;

:&quot;Section 2. For purposes of this article, a crime victim includes any person against whom the criminal offense is committed or who is directly harmed by the commission of an act, which, if committed by a competent adult, would constitute a crime.&quot;

:&quot;Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it has been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within 14 years after the date of its submission to the States by the Congress. This article shall take effect on the 180th day after the date of its ratification.&quot;&quot;

There have been several previous versions of the Victims&#x27; Rights Amendment. The text of one version reads as follows:

:&quot;Section 1. Victims of crimes of violence and other crimes that Congress and the States may define by law pursuant to section 3, shall have the rights to notice of and not to be excluded from all public proceedings relating to the crime; to be heard if present and to submit a statement at a public pre-trial or trial proceeding to determine a release from custody, an acceptance of a negotiated plea, or a sentence; to these rights at a parole proceeding to the extent they are afforded to the convicted offender; to notice of a release pursuant to a public or parole proceeding or an escape; to a final disposition free from unreasonable delay; to an order of restitution from the convicted offender; to have the safety of the victim considered in determining a release from custody; and to notice of the rights established by this article.&quot;

:&quot;Section 2. The victim shall have standing to assert the rights established by this article; however, nothing in this article shall provide grounds for the victim to challenge a charging decision or a conviction, obtain a stay of trial, or compel a new trial; nor shall anything in this article give rise to a claim for damages against the United States, a State, a political subdivision, or a public official; nor shall anything in this article provide grounds for the accused or convicted offender to obtain any form of relief.&quot;

:&quot;Section 3. The Congress and the States shall have the power to enforce this article within their respective federal and state jurisdictions by appropriate legislation, including the power to enact exceptions when required for compelling reasons of public safety.&quot;

:&quot;Section 4. The rights established by this article shall be applicable to all proceedings occurring after ratification of this article.&quot;

:&quot;Section 5. The rights established by this article shall apply in all federal, state, military, and juvenile justice proceedings, and shall also apply to victims in the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.&quot;

<text>Jess Thomas (August 4, 1927 – October 11, 1993) was an American operatic tenor, best known for singing the works of Richard Wagner.

==Biography==

Jess Floyd Thomas was born in Hot Springs, South Dakota. As a child, he took part in various musical activities and studied psychology at the University of Nebraska. For several years, he worked as a high school guidance counselor, before enrolling at Stanford University for an MA. Learning that the operatic department was producing Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;, he auditioned for Otto Schulmann, the vocal professor, and obtained the role of Fenton. Although by now 27 years old, Thomas decided to change careers and to become a singer. He studied with Schulmann for three years before his operatic debut in 1957. In 1958, he joined the Badisches Staatstheater in Karlsruhe, Germany. He was awarded the Wagner Medal at Bayreuth in 1963. His many appearances in North America and Europe between the late 1950s and early 1980s included fifteen seasons in 109 performances of fifteen roles at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.

Thomas died in Tiburon, California in 1993, aged 66.

==Operatic career==
Thomas made his operatic debut in 1957 for the San Francisco Opera, performing in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; as the Haushofmeister. In 1958, he debuted in the title role of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; for the Karlsruhe Staatstheater at the commencement of a career in Germany.

It was at Bayreuth that he established his reputation as a Wagnerian tenor, performing in the following roles and operas:
* Parsifal 1961–63, 1965
* Lohengrin 1962, 1967
* Siegmund in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (Bayreuth Festival on Tour in Osaka) 1967
* Walther in &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; 1963, 1969
* Tannhäuser 1966–67
* Siegfried 1969, 1976

In 1963, Thomas joined the roster of the Metropolitan Opera and went on to sing 109 performances of fifteen roles with the company, including all the major tenor roles of Wagner&#x27;s work. Among the highlights of his career with the Met was appearing at the opening of the new Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center, in the first performance of Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; with Leontyne Price.

In 1970, at the 12th Annual Grammy Awards, Thomas won a Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording for his performance of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Siegfried&quot;, with the Berlin Philharmonic.

On December 9, 1981, San Francisco Opera general director Kurt Herbert Adler called Thomas an hour before a performance of &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. Heldentenor James King had lost his voice, and Adler asked Thomas if he would like to sing the role in an hour. &quot;But I haven&#x27;t even shaved yet&quot;, Thomas said. Though he hadn&#x27;t looked at the score in years, Thomas performed the role at the age of 54, relying on a memory of the role, with some prompting. The next day, headlines proclaimed Thomas&#x27;s eleventh-hour rescue for &quot;Die Walküre&quot;. Thomas&#x27;s farewell performance took place in the title role of &quot;Parsifal&quot; with the Metropolitan Opera in 1982, while it was on tour in Washington, D.C.

In 1997, on request of Thomas&#x27;s widow, Violeta Thomas, the Austrian sculptor Hortensia Fussy made a portrait of Jess Thomas, showing him as Siegfried with his sword. The sculpture was donated to the Austrian Theatre Museum in 2002.

<doc id="1239064" wikidata="Q56716" url="?curid=1239064" title="Alsea">
<text>The Alsea are a Native American tribe of Western Oregon. They are (since 1856), confederated with other Tribes on the Siletz Reservation, Oregon, and are members of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz.

Their origin story says that the Yaquina, Alsea, Yachats, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw people are all one tribe, and speak the same language. Today however, the Yakonan language branch is divided into Alsean and Siuslawan. The Alsean people (Yaquina/Alsea/Yachats) all practiced forehead flattening (by slight pressure applied in baby&#x27;s cradleboard) until about 1860. The Alsea signed the 1855 Coast Treaty, agreeing to share their homelands with other Tribes when the Siletz Reservation was to be established, the treaty not being ratified by the U.S. Senate, the appropriations never arrived. The Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, represented Tillamook, Yaquina, Alsea, Coquille, Tututni, Chetco aboriginal title compensation claims in the 1940s–50s. The lawsuit “Alsea Band of Tillamooks et al vs the United States”. The confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians won that case, and some compensation was received about 1959.

==Name==
The name &quot;Alsea&quot; comes from &quot;/alsíiya/&quot;, the name applied to the Alseas by their neighbors, the Tillamook and Coos peoples.

Kûnis&#x27;tûnne, Chastacosta name. Päifan amím, Luckiamute Kalapuya name. Si ni&#x27;-te-li tunne, Naltunne name, meaning &quot;flatheads.&quot; Tcha yáxo amim, Luckiamute Kalapuya name. Tehayesátlu, Nestucca name.

==Geography==
The Alsea lived on the western coast of Oregon, around what is now Alsea Bay at the mouth of the Alsea River.&lt;br&gt;
:Villages
*Chiink, on the south side of Alsea River.
*Kakhtshanwaish, on the north side of Alsea River.
*Kalbusht, on the lower course of Alsea River.
*Kauhuk, on the south side of Alsea River.
*Kaukhwan, on the north side of Alsea River at Beaver Creek.
*Khlimkwaish, on the south side of Alsea River.
*Khlokhwaiyutslu, on the north side of Alsea River.
*Kutauwa, on the north side of Alsea River at its mouth.
*Kwamk, on the south side of Alsea River.
*Kwulisit, on the south side of Alsea River.
*Kyamaisu, on the north side of Alsea River at its mouth.
*Panit, on the south side of Alsea River.
*Shiuwauk, on the north side of Alsea River.
*Skhakhwaiyutslu, on the south side of Alsea River.
*Tachuwit, on the north side of Alsea River.
*Thlekuhweyuk, on the south side of Alsea River.
*Thlekushauk, on the south side of Alsea River.
&lt;br&gt;&quot;Mooney (1928) estimates the number of Indians belonging to the Yakonan stock at 6,000 in 1780. The census of 1910 returned 29 Indians under this name, and that of 1930 only 9 under the entire Yakonan stock.&quot;

==Culture==
The Alsea hunted seals and sea lions, fished for salmon, and gathered camas roots. Like many tribes in the area, they flattened the heads of infants. They placed their dead in canoes on isolated land jutting into estuaries.

===Language===
Alsea was an Alsean language very closely related to Yaquina. By 1910, it was almost extinct, with fewer than six people having a speaking knowledge of the language.

===Religion===
Very little is known about Alsea religion. It is thought to be similar to that of the Coos. Alsea shamans promoted good salmon runs and the Alsea appealed to animal spirits and powers in nature for aid.

===Arts===
The Alsea wore robes of seal skin, wove baskets and made grass raincoats.

<doc id="1239066" wikidata="Q805753" url="?curid=1239066" title="B&amp;O Railroad Museum">
<text>The B&amp;O Railroad Museum is a museum and historic railway station exhibiting historic railroad equipment in Baltimore, Maryland. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) company originally opened the museum on July 4, 1953, with the name of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Transportation Museum. It has been called one of the most significant collections of railroad treasures in the world and has the largest collection of 19th-century locomotives in the U.S. The museum is located in the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s old Mount Clare Station and adjacent roundhouse, and retains 40 acres of the B&amp;O&#x27;s sprawling Mount Clare Shops site, which is where, in 1829, the B&amp;O began America&#x27;s first railroad and is the oldest railroad manufacturing complex in the United States.

Mount Clare is considered to be a birthplace of American railroading, as the site of the first regular railroad passenger service in the U.S., beginning on May 22, 1830. It was also to this site that the first telegraph message, &quot;What hath God wrought?&quot; was sent on May 24, 1844, from Washington, D.C., using Samuel Morse&#x27;s electric telegraph.

The museum houses collections of 19th- and 20th-century artifacts related to America&#x27;s railroads. The collection includes 250 pieces of railroad rolling stock, 15,000  artifacts, of archival material, four significant 19th-century buildings, including the historic roundhouse, and a mile of track, considered the most historic mile of railroad track in the United States. Train rides are offered on the mile of track on Wednesday through Sunday from April through December and on weekends in January. In 2002, the museum had 160,000 visitors annually.

The museum also features an outdoor G-scale layout, two indoor HO scale model, and a wooden model train for children to climb on. From Thanksgiving through the New Year, local model railroad groups set up large layouts on the roundhouse floor and in select locations on the grounds of the museum. A museum store offers toys, books, DVDs, and other railroad-related items.

The museum and station were designated as a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1961. In 2008, the museum won three awards in Nickelodeon&#x27;s Parents&#x27; Picks Awards in the categories of Best Museum for Little Kids, Best Indoor Playspace for Little Kids, and Best Indoor Playspace for Big Kids. Television and film actor Michael Gross is the museum&#x27;s &quot;celebrity spokesman&quot;.

The museum definitively documented 24 Freedom Seekers that used the B&amp;O Railroad on their journeys on the Underground Railroad – 8 of which traveled through the museum&#x27;s historic site of Mount Clare. In 2021, the museum&#x27;s Mount Clare Station building was designated as a National Park Service Underground Railroad Network to Freedom site.

The museum also hosts an annual Day Out with Thomas event every year, complete with the train&#x27;s excursion including a non-powered Thomas the Tank Engine replica.

==History==
The inaugural horse-drawn B&amp;O train traveled the of the newly completed track from Mount Clare to Ellicott Mills (now Ellicott City, Maryland), on May 22, 1830, the first regular railroad passenger service in the U.S. The existing Mount Clare station brick structure was constructed in 1851. The adjacent roundhouse designed by Ephraim Francis Baldwin was built in 1884 to service the B&amp;O&#x27;s passenger cars.

For much of its history, the B&amp;O had been collecting locomotives and other artifacts from its history for public relations purposes. This collection was stored in various places until the railroad decided to centralize it in a permanent home. The car shop of the Mt. Clare Shops was chosen, and the new museum opened on July 4, 1953.

The museum ended up outliving its parent B&amp;O Railroad, and was kept intact by both the Chessie System and CSX Corporation. In 1990, CSX deeded the property and collection to the newly formed, not-for-profit museum organization governed by an independent board of directors and provided it with a $5 million endowment. In 1999, the museum became affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.

In the early morning of February 17, 2003, heavy snow from the Presidents&#x27; Day Storm collapsed half of the roof of the museum&#x27;s roundhouse. Although the structure&#x27;s central support columns remained standing, the supporting iron struts and ties of the destroyed roofing sections failed under the snow load. The museum suffered heavy damage not only to the roundhouse itself but also to the collection within the roundhouse. Some of the items were damaged beyond repair. Reporting on the devastation the following day, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said, &quot;...hours after the collapse, columns of mangled steel stuck out from the roundhouse ... Locomotives and passenger cars in the museum&#x27;s collection, some dating from the 1830s, could be seen covered with snow and debris.&quot; The roundhouse, with a newly repaired roof, reopened to the public on November 13, 2004, and the damaged locomotives and cars were surrounded by a plexiglass barrier. As of September 2015, all damaged exhibits have been restored to their original appearance.

After the roof collapse, subsequent fundraising and restoration allowed the museum to upgrade many of its facilities. In 2005 the museum opened a new service facility west of the roundhouse for restoration of historical equipment and maintenance of active equipment.

== Collection ==
The B&amp;O Railroad Museum possesses the oldest and most comprehensive American railroad collections in the world. Dating from the beginning of American railroading, the collection contains locomotives and rolling stock, historic buildings, railroading artifacts, and an extensive archives and research library that documents the impact of American railroading and the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad on American economics, culture, and history.

The collection is being made available through an online searchable database.

<text>Alun William Evans (born 30 April 1949) is an English former footballer who made his name as a centre forward in the Liverpool side rebuilt by Bill Shankly at the start of the 1970s. He was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire.

==Career==
Evans began his professional career with Wolverhampton Wanderers, breaking into the first team in the 1967/68 season. He had already appeared for the club on their summer success in winning the United Soccer Association under the guise of the Los Angeles Wolves in Summer 1967.

He only had one full season in Wolves&#x27; first team as he swiftly joined Liverpool in September 1968 for £100,000, making him Britain&#x27;s most expensive teenager. He had caught the eye of manager Bill Shankly after he outran and out-thought Liverpool captain Ron Yeats in a match in 1968. Although only 19, and despite Shankly&#x27;s known desire to introduce new players gradually to the team, Evans was put straight into the side and stayed there until the end of the season.

He made his debut on 21 September 1968 in a league match against Leicester City at Anfield, scoring in a 4–0 win. Evans went on to feature in 33 league games, scoring seven goals as Liverpool finished runners-up to Leeds.

After an unimpressive 1969–70 campaign, he fared better the next season, scoring frequently in the opening games but suffered from injury and ill-luck which forced him out of the team, including facial scarring after being attacked with broken glass in a nightclub.

He returned to the fray near the end, and bagged a hat-trick during this season in a European Fairs Cup fourth round 1st leg tie at home to German giants Bayern Munich in a 3–0 win that ultimately saw them through 4–1 on aggregate. He also scored a magnificent equaliser against Merseyside rivals Everton as Liverpool came from behind to win their FA Cup semi-final at Old Trafford. However, Evans played disappointingly in the final and was substituted midway through the second half. Liverpool eventually lost 2–1 to Arsenal after extra time.

His Anfield career did not last much longer, as the signing of Kevin Keegan pushed him aside, and he managed only a handful of appearances in 1971–72. After 111 first team appearances, he departed for Second Division, newly promoted, Aston Villa for £72,000 on 20 June 1972; Evans could have joined the Villa Park club straight from school as he impressed during a trial in 1964, however, he had decided to sign for Midland rivals Wolves.

He remained at Villa Park for just two-and-a-half seasons, before being allowed to leave for fellow Midlanders Walsall for £30,000 on 14 December 1975, after 71 games and 17 goals. Ironically, 5 months after Evans departed, Villa gained the promotion back to the big time they yearned for, finishing runner-up to Manchester United by 3 points. Following two full seasons at Walsall, which included scoring a goal that knocked Leicester out of the F.A. Cup and won &#x27;Goal of the Month&#x27; on Match of the Day, the striker ended his career abroad playing in both the US and Australia (with South Melbourne FC, Morwell Falcons and Sandringham City SC).

<text>Ecumenopolis (; ; ) is the hypothetical concept of a planetwide city. It is primarily known as a stock setting in science fiction, but has also received serious consideration in theoretical city planning and futurist concepts.

==Description==
The word was invented in 1967 by the Greek city planner Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis to represent the idea that, in the future, urban areas and megalopolises would eventually fuse, and there would be a single continuous worldwide city as a progression from the current urbanization, population growth, transport and human networks. According to Doxiadis, it was the fifteenth level of ekistic units and the most significant one as the uppermost echelon of the classification. This concept was already current in science fiction in 1942, with Trantor in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation&quot; series. When made public, Doxiadis&#x27; idea of ecumenopolis seemed &quot;close to science fiction&quot;, but today is &quot;surprisingly pertinent&quot; according to geography researchers Pavle Stamenovic, Dunja Predic and Davor Eres, especially as a consequence of globalization.

Doxiadis also created a scenario based on the traditions and trends of urban development of his time, predicting at first a European eperopolis (&quot;continent city&quot;) which would be based on the area between London, Paris, Rhine-Ruhr and Amsterdam. In 2008, &quot;Time&quot; magazine coined &quot;Nylonkong&quot; to link New York City, London, and Hong Kong as the eperopolis of the Americas, Euro-Africa and Asia-Pacific respectively.

==In popular culture== 

Before the term had been created, the concept had been previously discussed. The American religious leader Thomas Lake Harris (1823–1906) mentioned city-planets in his verses, and science fiction author Isaac Asimov used the city-planet Trantor as the setting of some of his &quot;Foundation&quot; novels.

In science fiction, the ecumenopolis has become a frequent topic and was popularized in 1999 by the fictional city planet Coruscant in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, which is the capital of the Galactic Republic (later Empire) and home to the Jedi Order. In addition to Coruscant, &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; features the planet Hosnian Prime, the capital world of the New Republic.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, the Harkonnens&#x27; home world of Giedi Prime is a heavily polluted ecumenopolis infamous for its gladiator arenas.

The concept is depicted in the video game &quot;Stellaris&quot;, where players are given the option of transforming planets into ecumenopolises, which provides a great deal of housing and space for industrial production through the construction of arcologies, at the cost of making the planet&#x27;s natural resources inaccessible.

A central setting in the tabletop wargame &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; is a portrayal of Earth in the far future, where it is described as having been transformed into a vast, Gothic-style ecumenopolis sometime during the 30th millennium AD after its establishment as the capital of an interstellar superpower known as the Imperium of Man. The ecumenopolis contains multiple continent-scale districts housing different branches of society and government, with the Imperial Palace alone taking up the entirety of the Himalayan Mountains. It is the focus of the &quot;Siege of Terra&quot; storyline of the wider &quot;Horus Heresy&quot; tie-in novel series.

In &quot;&quot;, the plane of Ravnica is an ecumenopolis.

DC Comics continuity features Darkseid&#x27;s extra-dimensional home planet of Apokolips, often depicted as a hellish world covered entirely in industrial sprawl to feed Darkseid&#x27;s brutal empire.

The manga and film of &quot;Blame!&quot; by Tsutomu Nihei is set in a far future in which Earth has become the ruins of planet-covering city, which is suggested to be so large that it has consumed most of the Solar System as well, it may also be along the lines of a hollow-world or dyson shell. Some of his other works also take place in this same setting.
