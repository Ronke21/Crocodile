<text>Rexel S.A. is a French company specializing in the distribution of electrical, heating, lighting and plumbing equipment, but also in renewable energies and energy efficiency products and services.

The group has 1,950 points of sale in 19 countries and employs more than 27,000 people. Rexel is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange.

== History ==
The Rexel Group is the descendant of Compagnie de Distribution de Matériel Électrique (CDME), which was created in 1967 by Compagnie Lebon. CDME was the result of the merger of four companies: Revimex, Facen, Sotel and Lienard-Soval. It specialized in electrical equipment sales and grew in France through the acquisition of regional family businesses. In 1978, the company launched a professional electronic and computer equipment distribution branch and diversified into the industrial supplies business.

Beginning in the 1980s, CDME began its expansion into European and international markets by setting up in Cyprus, Saudi Arabia, Portugal, Benelux, West Germany, Singapore and Canada.

In 1983, CDME joined the unlisted securities market of the Paris Stock Exchange. The company then held more than 20% of the market share in France and 6% worldwide. In 1986, it began doing business in the United States. At that time, it had 350 points of sale, 65 of which were abroad. In 1987, Compagnie Française de l&#x27;Afrique Occidentale (CFAO) became the main shareholder of CDME (68%).

=== Rexel Group ===
The Pinault Group acquired CDME in December 1990 and became its main shareholder. The electrical equipment distribution subsidiary accounted for 38% of the Pinault Group&#x27;s total sales. CDME was then the leading distributor of electrical equipment in France (30% market share), Belgium and Portugal.

In June 1993, CDME joined forces with Groupelec Distribution. That is when the group took on the name Rexel.

In the 1990s, the group continued to strengthen its business in France, Europe and the United States. The company re-centered its operations on the distribution of electrical equipment. In 1988, it had sold most of its professional electronics distribution interests and in 1994 it separated from its subsidiary GDFI, France&#x27;s largest distributor of industrial supplies.

The group&#x27;s subsidiaries gradually adopted the Rexel brand identity abroad. Willcox and Gibbs in the United States became Rexel Inc. in 1995; Rexel Italia was born in 2000 from the merger of 10 Italian subsidiaries; and the first joint venture was formed in China under the name Rexel Hailongxing.

=== Evolution of the group ===
The PPR (Pinault-Printemps-Redoute) Group announced the sale of Rexel, which was finalized on March 16, 2005, with the Ray Investment consortium acquiring shares in the company. The consortium members included Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, Eurazeo and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity. Rexel was de-listed from the Paris Stock Exchange on April 25, 2005. The Rexel Group continued refocusing on its core business. It disposed of certain assets while embarking on a series of acquisitions. In addition to the 29 small and medium-sized acquisitions it made over the period, in 2006 the group bought the American distribution subsidiary of General Electric, GE Supply, which it renamed Gexpro. That moved Rexel into the number one position in North America and Asia-Pacific. Gexpro reinforced the group&#x27;s provision of services to major industrial accounts.

In 2007, Rexel teamed up with the Sonepar Group to make a joint offer to purchase the Hagemeyer Group which was then number 3 worldwide. In 2007, Rexel changed its legal status to become a French public limited company (société anonyme) with a management board and supervisory board. The company was listed on the Paris stock exchange on April 4, 2007 on the Euronext market. In March 2008, Rexel acquired the majority of Hagemeyer&#x27;s European assets (Elektroskandia in Scandinavia, ABM in Spain and Newey &amp; Eyre in the United Kingdom). Following that acquisition, Rexel doubled its total sales in Europe, increased the number of points of sale by 50%, and entered the markets of five new countries (Finland, Norway and the Baltic States). Rexel was the largest or second-largest market player in Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden and Finland. In 2008, Rexel held around 9% of the world market for the distribution of professional electrical equipment. With 2,500 points of sale in 34 countries, the group was a leading player in this sector.

In 2011, the company began seeking acquisitions in emerging markets. As a result, Rexel strengthened its position in China with the acquisition of Lucky Well Zhineng and notably penetrated markets in Brazil (Nortel Suprimentos Industriais), India (Yantra Automation) and Peru (where it bought V&amp;F Technologia, a Lima-based distributor of electrical equipment distributor). In early 2012, the group acquired the companies Delamano and Etil, becoming a leader in the Brazilian market. It also continued expanding in the United States by acquiring the independent electrical equipment distributor Platt Electric Supply and Munro Distributing Company for 115 million Euros, which bolstered its presence in the American energy efficiency market across the pond. The year 2012 also marked the start of Rudy Provoost&#x27;s tenure as chairman of the management board. He succeeded Jean-Charles Pauze. The company launched the Energy in Motion project in 2012 which put customers at the heart of its strategy.

In June 2013, the group created the Rexel Foundation to harness its know-how and expertise to fight energy poverty. In 2014, the group announced it was purchasing Esabora, a software company that publishes sales and administrative management tools for electricians. In 2015, the Group strengthened its position in the multi-energy sector in France with the acquisition of Sofinther, a distributor specializing in thermal, heating and control equipment. On April 30, 2015, Rexel announced the sale of its businesses in Latin America. In January 2016, Rexel announced it was selling its interests in Poland, Slovakia and the Baltic countries to Würth.

In January 2016, the group sold its interests in Poland, Slovakia and the Baltic States to the Würth Group. In February 2016, as part of its acquisition policy, Rexel purchased Brohl &amp; Appell, an American company specialized in industrial automation and MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations) services. In July 2016, Rexel changed its governance structure and separated the functions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Patrick Berard was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Ian Meakins was named Chairman of the Board of Directors. In February 2017, Rexel announced a new strategic plan intended to refocus its activity on the most promising countries and market segments in order to accelerate the group&#x27;s organic growth, by promoting the digital transformation of electrical equipment and hardware, including connected objects. In December 2017, the group announced it would sell its activities in South-East Asia to American Industrial Acquisition Corporation Group.

In 2020, the group parted ways with its Gexpro Services business to devote its resources to the crux of its strategy: the distribution of electrical equipment in the United States and the digital transformation of that equipment. The group reasserted its commitment to evolve toward a data-driven business model. In February 2021, the group acquired the Canadian operations of Wesco International and in March 2021 announced the acquisition of Freshmile Services, an independent charging station operator that offers monitoring services and software. The group also gained a 25% minority stake in Trace Software International, a software company specializing in electrical design. These two moves were intended to build the group&#x27;s electromobility capacity.

In November, 2021, Rexel closed on the acquisition of Mayer, a major distributor of electrical products and services operating in the Eastern part of the United States. This followed their announcement in February to resume bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen positioning in the United States. The Mayer business added 68 points of sale for Rexel generating $1.2B in annual sales as of August, 2021.

Rexel turned down an offer to be acquired by QXO Inc., an American building materials company led by Brad Jacobs, for $9.6 billion in September 2024.

<text>A sheep shearer is a worker who uses (hand-powered)-blade or machine shears to remove wool from domestic sheep during crutching or shearing.

==History==
During the early years of sheep breeding in Australia, shearing was carried out by shepherds, assigned servants, Ticket of Leave men, and free labourers using blade shears. As the sheep industry expanded, more shearers were required. Although the demand had increased, conditions had not improved and shearers had to contend with terrible working conditions, very long hours and low pay. In 1888, Australia became the first country in the world to have a complete shearing, at Dunlop Station, finished using machines.

By 1915, most large Australian sheep station shearing sheds had machines that were powered by steam engines. Later, internal combustion engines powered machines until rural power supplies became available.

==Sheep shearing today==
In most countries like Australia with large sheep flocks, the shearer is one of a contractor&#x27;s team that go from property to property shearing sheep and preparing the wool for market. A workday starts at 7:30 am and the day is divided into four “runs” of two hours each. “Smoko” breaks of a half hour each are at 9:30 am and again at 3 pm. The lunch break is taken at 12 midday for one hour. Most shearers are paid on a piece rate, i.e., per sheep. The shearer collects a sheep from a catching pen, positions it on his “stand” on the shearing board and operates the shearing hand-piece. A shearer begins by removing the wool over the sheep&#x27;s belly, which is separated from the main fleece by a rouseabout while the sheep is still being shorn. The remainder of the fleece is taken off in one piece by following an efficient set of movements.

In the case of powered shears, the movements used are those devised by Godfrey Bowen, in approximately 1950, or the “Tally-Hi” method. In 1963, the Tally-Hi shearing system was developed by Kevin Sarre and the Australian Wool Corporation who promoted the technique using synchronised shearing demonstrations. Sheep struggle less using the Tally-Hi method, reducing strain on the shearer and there is a saving of about 30 seconds shearing each sheep. When finished, the shorn sheep is removed from the board via a chute in the floor, or wall, to a counting out pen, efficiently removing it from the shed.

The latest shearing patterns which are used by some of the most efficient shearers around the world, world record holders, world champions, etc. have fewer blows due to better sheep control and positioning. These patterns ensure that there is less strain placed on the sheep and the shearers due to the advanced techniques used.
A professional or &quot;gun&quot; shearer typically removes a fleece, without badly marking or cutting the sheep, in two to three minutes depending on the size and condition of the sheep, or less than two in elite competitive shearing. Shearers who “tally” more than 400 sheep per day when shearing crossbreds, or around 200 for finer wool sheep such as merino, are known as “gun shearers”. Gun shearers using blade shears are usually shearers that have shorn at least 200 sheep in a day. A learner (shearer) is a shearer or intending shearer who has shorn less than a specified number of sheep.

In 1983 the Australian shearing industry was torn apart by the wide comb dispute and the ensuing 10-week strike that followed. The offending combs had been introduced by New Zealanders who were weaker union supporters. In 1984, Australia became the last country in the world to permit the use of wide combs, due to previous Australian Workers&#x27; Union rulings.

The Shear Outback, Australian Shearers&#x27; Hall of Fame and museum, was officially opened on 26 January 2001 at Hay, New South Wales in recognition the great wool industry and the great shearers of Australia, especially those of the Outback. The inaugural inductees into the Australian Shearers’ Hall of Fame are Jackie Howe (1861–1920), Julian Stuart (1866–1929), Henry Salter MBE (1907–1997), Kevin Sarre (1933–1995) and John Hutchinson OAM. These inductees were chosen because they had won world championships or had shorn high tallies.

==Clothing==

The shearers’ protective clothing and footwear usually includes:

* Shearers&#x27; jeans or dungarees which have a double thickness of material over the front and lower back leg.
* Shearers&#x27; singlets: singlets with patches under the arms where the sheep&#x27;s feet are placed during shearing.
* Shearers&#x27; boots: leather boots with elastic sides or lacing across the front and a flap to prevent the comb catching in the laces
or
* Shearers&#x27; moccasins: a modern synthetic fleece version of the laced boots above, which have a non-slip coating on the sole to prevent slipping on grease in the shearing sheds. These moccasins are washable to prevent the spread of disease and lice etc.

==Records==
On 10 October 1892, Jackie Howe set a record of 321 sheep shorn in 7 hours and 40 minutes, using blade shears. He had previously set a weekly aggregate record of 1,437 sheep over a total working week of 44 hours and 30 minutes.
While Howe&#x27;s weekly aggregate record remained until at least 2005, his daily record tally was broken using machine shears by Ted Reick in 1950.

Kevin Sarre (1933–1995) was one of the world&#x27;s greatest 20th Century machine shearers. He won many shearing championships including five Australian Titles, was a Golden Shears Winner in 1963 and held World Shearing Record in 1965 of shearing 346 Merinos. In 1963, Kevin in association with the Australian Wool Board, was instrumental in the development of the revolutionary Tally-Hi shearing technique, and went on to supervise the training of this technique throughout Australia. The Tally-Hi shearing technique reduced the time taken to shear a sheep by approximately 30 seconds. Kevin&#x27;s daughter Deanne holds the Australian women&#x27;s shearing record, having shorn 392 sheep in a day.

Henry Salter (1907–1997) MBE won the first organised shearing contest at Pyramid Hill in 1934 and in 1953 was a machine shearing champion. He continued to use blade shears until he was well into his 80s. In 1946 Salter organised the first Australian shearing school at Kerang, Victoria. During the next 26 years he taught 6,557 students the art of shearing. In 1968 Henry Salter was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the wool industry.

John Hutchinson from South Australia is a former Australian Shearing Champion who won the first of six Australian championships and demonstrated shearing at the Osaka World Expo. In 1999 Hutchinson was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for his contribution as a shearer trainer and teacher.

Australian Dwayne Black holds six world records, mainly in shearing endurance or marathon events. On 6 October 2002 he shore 570 Merino lambs in 9 hours at Yeeramulla, Badgingarra, Western Australia. In April 2005, he spent 9 hours shearing 513 Merino ewes, six more than the previous world record. In October of the same year he shore 519 crossbred lambs at the showground, Bendigo, Victoria.

On 2 March 2007, Broomehill shearer Brendan Boyle set the world 24-hour sheep shearing record by shearing 841 full wool Merino sheep, and in the process raised over $20,000 for the fight against prostate cancer. It was the first time a record has been set in 24 hours sheep shearing. However, for the record to be officially recognized, it needs to be overseen by the World Sheep Shearing Records Committee. This committee has a set of rules, and official referees in three member countries for the specific purpose of ensuring records are set under the same rules and consistent referees in these countries.

In competition sports shearers, using blades or machine driven hand-pieces, can usually achieve short-term rates that are greater than for day shearers.

<doc id="1248969" wikidata="Q238261" url="?curid=1248969" title="Saint Sarah">
<text>Saint Sarah, also known as Sara-la-Kâli (&quot;Sara the Black&quot;; ), is the patron saint of the Romani people in Folk Catholicism. The center of her veneration is Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, a place of pilgrimage for Roma in the Camargue, in Southern France. Legend identifies her as the servant of one of the Three Marys, with whom she is supposed to have arrived in the Camargue. Saint Sarah also shares her name with the Hindu goddess Kali who is a popular deity in northern India from where the Romani people originate. The name &quot;Sara&quot; itself is seen in the appellation of Durga as Kali in the famed text Durgasaptashati. Despite her popular veneration amongst Romani Catholics, she is not considered a Saint by the Roman Catholic Church.

==Accounts==

According to various legends, during a persecution of early Christians, commonly placed in the year 42, Lazarus, his sisters Mary and Martha, Mary Salome (the mother of the Apostles John and James), Mary Jacobe and Maximin were sent out to sea in a boat. They arrived safely on the southern shore of Gaul at the place later called Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. Sarah, a native of Berenice Troglodytica, appears as the black Indo-Egyptian maid of one of the Three Marys, usually Mary Jacobe.
(The natives of Berenice Troglodytica had ancestors who once came from the Malabar Coast, through Indo-Roman trade relations, and settled in Egypt (Roman province) and intermarried with Egyptians.)

Though the tradition of the Three Marys arriving in France stems from the High Middle Ages, appearing for instance in the 13th century &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, Saint Sarah makes her first appearance in Vincent Philippon&#x27;s book &quot;The Legend of the Saintes-Maries&quot; (1521), where she is portrayed as &quot;a charitable woman that helped people by collecting alms, which led to the popular belief that she was a Gypsy.&quot; Subsequently, Sarah was adopted by Romani as their saint.

Another account has Sarah welcoming the Three Marys into Gaul. Franz de Ville (1956) writes:
One of our people who received the first Revelation was Sara the Kali. She was of noble birth and was chief of her tribe on the banks of the Rhône. She knew the secrets that had been transmitted to her... The Rom at that period practiced a polytheistic religion, and once a year they took out on their shoulders the statue of Ishtari (Astarte) and went into the sea to receive benediction there. One day Sara had visions which informed her that the Saints who had been present at the death of Jesus would come, and that she must help them. Sara saw them arrive in a boat. The sea was rough, and the boat threatened to founder. Mary Salome threw her cloak on the waves and, using it as a raft, Sarah floated towards the Saints and helped them reach land by praying.

==Pilgrimage==
The day of the pilgrimage honouring Sarah is May 24; her statue is carried down to the sea on this day to re-enact her arrival in France.

Some authors have drawn parallels between the ceremonies of the pilgrimage and the worship of the Hindu goddess Kali (a form of Durga), subsequently identifying the two. Ronald Lee (2001) states:

If we compare the ceremonies with those performed in France at the shrine of Sainte Sara (called &quot;Sara e Kali&quot; in Romani), we become aware that the worship of Kali/Durga/Sara has been transferred to a Christian figure... in France, to a non-existent &quot;sainte&quot; called Sara, who is actually part of the Kali/Durga/Sara worship among certain groups in India.

The name &quot;Sara&quot; itself is seen in the appellation of Durga as Kali in the famed text Durgasaptashati.

==In popular culture==
Some authors, taking up themes from the pseudohistorical book &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot;, suggest that Sarah was the daughter of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. These ideas were popularized by Dan Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, Eron Manusov&#x27;s &quot;Ahavah&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and &quot;The Maeve Chronicles&quot; by Elizabeth Cunningham. These speculations have been rejected by the local inhabitants and by scholars.
* In &quot;The Rozabal Line&quot;, author Ashwin Sanghi puts forward that Sara-la-Kali refers to the three Hindu goddesses – Saraswati, Lakshmi, and Kali – the goddesses of Knowledge, Wealth and Power – symbolizing the trinity of female power. 
* In Paulo Coelho&#x27;s novel &quot;The Witch of Portobello&quot;, St. Sarah is mentioned several times.
* Alistair MacLean&#x27;s 1970 thriller, &quot;Caravan to Vaccarès&quot; is set during the pilgrimage to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.
* Czon the Swedish artist did a portrait of Sara La Kali outside the church in &quot;Saintes Maries de la Mer&quot; 2018.
* The statue of Saint Sarah makes an appearance in Tony Gatlif&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Latcho Drom&quot; (&quot;Safe Journey&quot;) where it is carried to the sea, and her landing is re-enacted.
* In &quot;Korkoro&quot;, also a Tony Gatlif film, the Romani often pray to Saint Sarah with intense fervor.
* The Chilean telenovela Romané also portrays the Romani&#x27;s fervor for Sara Kali, set in Antofagasta Region, North of Chile.

<doc id="1248972" wikidata="Q155974" url="?curid=1248972" title="Kungur">
<text>Kungur () is a town in the southeast of Perm Krai, Russia, located in the Ural Mountains at the confluence of the rivers Iren and Shakva with the Sylva (Kama&#x27;s basin). Population: 62,173 (2023 Estimate).

==History==
Kungur was founded above the Iren&#x27;s mouth on the banks of the Kungurka in 1648. In 1662, it was burnt by Bashkirs. In 1663, it was rebuilt as a fortress on the place of the village of Mysovskoye. In the beginning of the 18th century, leather and footwear industries started to develop here, and in 1724, a tannery was built. By the mid-18th century, Kungur became one of the most populated areas in the Urals. In 1759, Perm administration of mining plants was moved to Kungur. By the end of the 18th century, Kungur was an important transit trade center of the Siberian road, as well as the center of leather manufacture in Perm Governorate. Kungur rope and linseed oil were widely known. In 1774, the town withstood a siege by Yemelyan Pugachev&#x27;s Cossack forces. By the end of the 19th century, Kungur had become a significant industrial (including manufacture of leather footwear, gloves, and mittens) and cultural center.

In 1890 the Kungurian Age of the Permian Period of geological time was named for Kungur.

Kungur was the seat of the 1411th Artillery Ammunition Depot from 11 August 1941, the day of its establishment, to July 1945.

===Coat of arms===

The town&#x27;s original coat of arms became official according with the Highest Law of Empress Anna Ioannovna in 1737. The current coat of arms was adopted in 1994.

== Etymology ==
The name of the city was given by the &quot;Kungur River&quot;, which flows into the &quot;Iren&quot; at the site of the construction of the first fort. The hydronym arose under the influence of the Volga Bulgars (Ogur and Hungarian tribes) who came to the Volga-Kama territory in the 7th century, from them the name Kungur &lt; Hungur &lt; Vungur &lt; Ungur is the name of the Onogur (On ogur) and Hungarian tribes. On the territory of Perm the Great and Udmurtia, archaeologists find quite a lot of Bulgar objects.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kungur serves as the administrative center of Kungursky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of krai significance of Kungur—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.

==Tourism and attractions==
===Kungur Ice Cave===
The Kungur Ice Cave is located in the vicinity of Kungur, on the right bank of the Sylva River. Ramified passages stretch under the ground for over 6,000 meters, and only a small part has already been explored. To this day, old slides and crumblings do not allow to determine the total length of the passages. In the explored part of the cave there are several dozens of grottoes; the largest one, which is called the Druzhba (Friendship) Grotto, was given its name in honor of the participants of the International Geological Congress who visited the cave in 1937. Inside this grotto there is a lake with the area of 750 m2. The grottoes are &quot;adorned&quot; with columns of stalagmites and icicles of stalactites up to two meters in height. Over millennia, limestone bearing water has created an infinite variety of forms in the cave, like snowflakes which change in size during the year and reach the size of a maple leaf during late winter. The cave is filled with water from the Sylva River twice a year, in spring and in fall, when it is not accessible to tourists.

<text>Rowland Oswald Colin Marks (4 February 1893 – 12 November 1977) was born in Auckland, New Zealand, and was a pioneer of the social credit movement in New Zealand.

He served in World War I as a sergeant and later second lieutenant in the New Zealand Rifle Brigade and earned the DCM. A teacher by profession, after graduating MA in 1922 from Auckland University College, Marks witnessed first-hand the difficulties faced by New Zealanders during the Depression. He became convinced that monetary reform was needed, and stood as the candidate for the Real Democracy Movement in the Wanganui electorate in the 1943 general election.

The Movement evolved into the New Zealand Social Credit Political League and Marks polled highly, though not enough to take the seat. When not running for Parliament, he served on the League&#x27;s national committee and was made a life member in 1968. Marks deservedly takes credit for establishing the Social Credit movement as a force in Wanganui.

<doc id="1248977" wikidata="Q1595294" url="?curid=1248977" title="Holy Chalice">
<text>The Holy Chalice, also known as the Holy Grail, is in some Christian traditions the vessel that Jesus used at the Last Supper to share his blood. The Synoptic Gospels refer to Jesus sharing a cup of wine with the Apostles, saying it was the covenant in his blood. The use of wine and chalice in the Eucharist in Christian churches is based on the Last Supper event. In the late 12th century, the author Robert de Boron associated the pre-existing story of the Holy Grail, a magical item from Arthurian literature, with the Holy Chalice. This association was continued in many subsequent Arthurian works, including the Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate) cycle, the Post-Vulgate Cycle, and Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. A cup kept in the Spanish Cathedral of Valencia has been identified since medieval times as the purported Holy Chalice used at the Last Supper.

==Last Supper==
The Gospel of Matthew (26:27–29) says:

And He took a cup and when He had given thanks He gave it to them saying &quot;Drink this, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until I drink it new with you in My Father&#x27;s kingdom.&quot;

This incident, traditionally known as the Last Supper, is also described by the gospel writers, Mark and Luke, and by the Apostle Paul in I Corinthians. With the preceding description of the breaking of bread, it is the foundation for the Eucharist or Holy Communion, celebrated regularly in many Christian churches. Except within the context of the Last Supper, the Bible makes no mention of the cup, and ascribes no significance whatsoever to the object itself.

St. John Chrysostom (347–407 AD) in his homily on &quot;Matthew&quot; asserted:

The table was not of silver, the chalice was not of gold in which Christ gave His blood to His disciples to drink, and yet everything there was precious and truly fit to inspire awe.

The pilgrim Antoninus of Piacenza (570 AD) in his descriptions of the holy places of Jerusalem, said that he saw &quot;the cup of onyx, which our Lord blessed at the last supper&quot; among many relics displayed at the Basilica erected by Constantine near to Golgotha and the Tomb of Christ.

Herbert Thurston in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; (1908) concluded that:

No reliable tradition has been preserved to us regarding the vessel used by Christ at the Last Supper. In the sixth and seventh centuries pilgrims to Jerusalem were led to believe that the actual chalice was still venerated in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, having within it the sponge which was presented to Our Saviour on Calvary.

According to one tradition, Saint Peter brought it to Rome, and passed it on to his successors (the Popes). In 258, when Christians were being persecuted by Emperor Valerian and the Romans demanded that relics be turned over to the government, Pope Sixtus II instead gave the cup to one of his deacons, Saint Lawrence, who passed it to a Spanish soldier, Proselius, with instructions to take it to safety in Lawrence&#x27;s home country of Spain.

==Medieval tradition==

=== Iconography ===
The iconic significance of the Chalice grew during the Early Middle Ages. Depictions of Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, such as that in the fourteenth-century frescoes of the church at Öja, Gotland (&quot;illustration, right&quot;), show a prefigured apparition of the Holy Chalice that stands at the top of the mountain, illustrating the words &quot;Let this cup be taken from me&quot;. Together with the halo-enveloped Hand of God and the haloed figure of Jesus, the halo image atop the chalice, as if of a consecrated Host, completes the Trinity by embodying the Holy Spirit.

===Holy Grail===

The Holy Grail appears as a miraculous artifact in Arthurian legend in the 12th century, and is soon associated with the Holy Chalice.

The &quot;Grail&quot; became interwoven with the legend of the Holy Chalice. The connection of the Holy Chalice with Joseph of Arimathea dates from Robert de Boron&#x27;s (late 12th century). The fully developed &quot;Grail legend&quot; of the 13th century identifies the Holy Grail with the Holy Chalice used in the Last Supper and later used to collect Christ&#x27;s blood, brought to Hispania by Joseph of Arimathea.

=== Medieval relics ===
In the account of Arculf, a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon pilgrim, mention is made of a chalice venerated as the one used in the Last Supper in a chapel near Jerusalem. This is the only mention of the veneration of such a relic in the Holy Land.

Two artifacts were claimed as the Holy Chalice in Western Christianity in the later medieval period. The first is the &quot;Santo Cáliz&quot;, an agate cup in the Cathedral of Valencia, purportedly from around the 1st century AD, and celebrated by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006 as &quot;this most famous chalice&quot; (&quot;hunc praeclarum Calicem&quot;); Valencia&#x27;s Holy Chalice is the object most commonly identified as a claimant to being the Holy Grail. The second is the &quot;Sacro Catino&quot; in Genoa Cathedral, a flat dish made of green glass; recovered from Caesarea in 1101, it was not identified as the Holy Chalice until much later, towards the end of the 13th century.

====Valencia Chalice====
The &quot;Holy Chalice&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Santo Cáliz&quot;) is an agate cup preserved in the Cathedral of Valencia. The chalice is commonly credited as being the actual Holy Grail used by Jesus during the Last Supper and is preserved in a chapel consecrated to it, where it still attracts the faithful on pilgrimage. The artifact has seemingly never been accredited with supernatural powers.

The cup is made of dark red agate which is mounted by means of a knobbed stem and two curved handles onto a base made from an inverted cup of chalcedony. The agate cup is about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) in diameter and the total height, including base, is about 17 centimetres (7 inches) high. The base, stems and handles are later additions purportedly medieval, with the lower part added &#x27;Arabic looking&#x27; inscription. The red agate cup itself (the chalice) was most likely produced in a Levantine or Egyptian workshop between the 2nd century BC and the 1st century AD.

It is kept together with an inventory list on vellum, said to have accompanied a lost letter which detailed state-sponsored Roman persecution of Christians that forced the church to split up its treasury and hide it with members, specifically the deacon Saint Lawrence.

The first explicit inventory reference to the present &quot;Chalice of Valencia&quot; is found in an inventory of the treasury of the monastery of San Juan de la Peña drawn up by Don Carreras Ramírez, Canon of Zaragoza, on 14 December 1134. The Chalice is described as the vessel in which &quot;Christ Our Lord consecrated his blood&quot; (&quot;En un arca de marfil está el Cáliz en que Cristo N. Señor consagró su sangre, el cual envió S. Lorenzo a su patria, Huesca&quot;).

Reference to the chalice is made again in 1399, when it was given by the monastery of San Juan de la Peña to king Martin I of Aragon in exchange for a gold cup.

Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass with the Holy Chalice in Valencia in November 1982, and in that occasion the Pope referred to it as &quot;a witness to Christ&#x27;s passage on Earth&quot;. In July 2006, at the closing Mass of the 5th World Meeting of Families in Valencia, Pope Benedict XVI also celebrated Mass with the Holy Chalice, on this occasion calling it &quot;this most famous chalice&quot; (&quot;hunc praeclarum Calicem&quot;), words in the Roman Canon said to have been used for the first popes to refer to the Holy Grail until the 4th century in Rome.

====Genoa Dish====
The &quot;Sacro Catino&quot; (&quot;Sacred Basin&quot;), kept in Genoa Cathedral, is a hexagonal dish made of green Egyptian glass, some 9 cm high and 33 cm across. It was taken to Genoa by Guglielmo Embriaco as part of the spoils from the conquest of Caesarea in 1101. William of Tyre (10.16) describes it as a &quot;vessel of the most green colour, in the shape of a serving dish&quot; (&quot;vas coloris viridissimi, in modum parapsidis formatum&quot;) which the Genoese thought to be made of emerald, and accepted as their share of the spoils. William states that the Genoese were still exhibiting the bowl, insisting on its miraculous properties due to its being made of emerald, in his own day (&quot;Unde et usque hodie transeuntibus per eos magnatibus, vas idem quasi pro miraculo solent ostendere, persuadentes quod vere sit, id quod color esse indicat, smaragdus&quot;), the implication being that emerald was thought to have miraculous properties of its own in medieval lore, and not that the bowl was thought of as a holy relic. The &quot;Sacro Catino&quot; would later become identified as the Holy Grail. The first explicit claim to this effect is found in the &quot;Chronicon&quot; by Jacobus de Voragine, written in the 1290s. Pedro Tafur, who visited Genoa in 1436, reported that the Holy Grail, &quot;made of a single emerald&quot; is kept in Genoa Cathedral.

The bowl was seized and taken to Paris by Napoleon in 1805, and it was damaged when it was returned to Genoa in 1816, on which occasion it was confirmed it is made of glass rather than emerald. It was the subject of various restorations, in 1908, 1951, and 2017.

The study of the object made during the period of presence in France by the Académie des sciences of the Institut de France established that it was a Byzantine crystal, and not emerald. Modern studies consider it to be an Islamic artifact of the 9th–10th century.

==Modern candidates==
Aside from the Holy Chalice of the Cathedral of Valencia, which some have believed to be the Holy Grail since the time of the first few centuries AD, and which has been used by popes to celebrate Mass through to the present, a number of other artifacts of greater or lesser notability have come to be identified with the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; or &quot;Holy Chalice&quot;, beginning with the rising popularity of the Grail legend in 19th-century Romanticism.

===Chalice of Doña Urraca===

The Chalice of Doña Urraca is an artifact kept in St. Isidore&#x27;s Basilica in León, Spain.
The connection of this artifact to the Holy Grail was made in the 2014 book &quot;Los Reyes del Grial&quot;, which develops the hypothesis that this artifact had been taken by Egyptian troops following the invasion of Jerusalem and the looting of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, then given by the Emir of Egypt to the Emir of Denia, who in the 11th century gave it to the Kings of Leon for them to spare his city in the Reconquista.

===Antioch Chalice=== 
This silver-gilt object is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was apparently made at Antioch in the early 6th century, and is of double-cup construction, with an outer shell of cast-metal open work, enclosing a plain silver inner cup. When it was first recovered in Antioch in 1910, it was touted as the Holy Chalice, an identification the Metropolitan Museum characterizes as &quot;ambitious&quot;. It is no longer identified as a chalice, having been identified by experts at Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland as likely a standing lamp, in a style of the 6th century.

===Nanteos Cup===
The Nanteos Cup is a medieval wood mazer bowl, held for many years at Nanteos Mansion, Rhydyfelin, near Aberystwyth in Wales.
It is recorded as having been attributed miraculous powers of healing in the late 19th century, and tradition apparently held it had been made from a piece of the True Cross at the time, but it came to be identified as the Holy Chalice in the early 20th century.

<doc id="1248992" wikidata="Q2270572" url="?curid=1248992" title="Roumoules radio transmitter">
<text>The Roumoules transmitter is the main broadcasting facility for longwave and mediumwave broadcasting of Radio Monte Carlo near Roumoules, France and is owned by Monaco Media Diffusion. The 1000 and 2000kW transmitters installed are among the most powerful in the world and can be received well at nighttime throughout Europe.

==Longwave transmitter==
The longwave transmitter at Roumoules, which was inaugurated in 1974, transmits at 216 kHz (until 1988: 218 kHz) with a transmission power of 1400 kW (until 1976: 2000 kW). It consists of two 1000 kW transmitters switched in parallel, which are however run with 700 kW output power. A third 1000 kW unit has been available since 1983. Although this unit is only used as backup unit, it is possible to switch all three units in parallel, which would allow an operation with a transmission power of 3000 kW. Since 31 March 2020 the transmitter has ceased transmitting the French programme of Radio Monte Carlo but remains available for contract use.

The longwave transmitter uses a directional aerial with a maximum strength pointing northwest (azimuth: 309°). It consists of three -high guyed masts, which are insulated against ground and ground-fed. As a backup a -high guyed, ground-fed lattice steel mast radiator is available on the site, which only allows an omnidirectional radiation pattern.

The grounding system of the long wave transmitter is very large. The total length of all wires of the grounding system is , covering an area of . Because the area around the mast is used for agriculture, the ground wires are laid to a depth of .

==Medium wave transmitter==
In 1987 a switchable directional antenna consisting of five ground-fed guyed masts was built nearby for the 1467 kHz medium wave frequency, which was previously transmitted from a transmitter at La Madonne. This antenna allows a switchable directional radiation in the following directions:

Changing the signal direction takes only 5 seconds. There are no matching network buildings at the bottom of the masts used for medium wave transmission – the devices for tuning the masts to the transmission line are placed in the open air, similar to those in the longwave antenna system.

The medium wave Roumoules transmitter has an output power of 1000 kW. It is also used for transmitting the religious programmes of Trans World Radio. In comparison to the longwave transmitter, which can be received well both at day and night in Southern France, Northern Italy, Switzerland and Southern Germany, this transmitter cannot be normally received well more than from Roumoules. However at night its transmissions may have at least the same range as those of the longwave system due to its skywave propagation.

==Power supply==
The Roumoules Transmitter consumes significant amounts of power, supplied by two transformers each capable of providing 5000 kW. The power is delivered to the transformers by a 150 kV and a 220 kV power line. The transmitter&#x27;s power supply is larger than required (an equivalent supply would provide a community of 5000 with its own substation to the 150 kV grid supply). This redundant supply ensures reliable power for the transmitter. There is a backup generating set of on the site and a possibility to supply the station at reduced power from the local 20 kV grid.

<text>A King&#x27;s Scout (also known as Queen&#x27;s Scout during the reign of Elizabeth II) is a Scout who has attained the King&#x27;s Scout [[Award]]. The King&#x27;s Scout Award is the highest youth award achievable in the Scouting movement in the Commonwealth realms, including the United Kingdom, Canada (King&#x27;s Venturer Award), Australia, and New Zealand (King&#x27;s Scout Kauri Award), where Scouts operate under the patronage of King Charles III. Whether the award recipient is a Queen&#x27;s or King&#x27;s Scout depends on who is the current monarch of the Commonwealth realms.

Initially the award required demonstrated proficiency in standardised Scoutcraft and skills useful for service to others and the nation. The current requirements are different in each country and now focus on personal development and typically involve achieving challenges from several areas such as community involvement, adventurous activities, personal growth and leadership development. King&#x27;s Scouts are entitled to attend one King&#x27;s Scout Parade held at Windsor Castle each year held on the Sunday closest to St George&#x27;s Day; this is the only time when Scouts officially march.

== History ==

In November 1909, King Edward VII approved Robert Baden-Powell&#x27;s request that boys who passed special tests for efficiency be ranked as &quot;King&#x27;s Scouts&quot;. A badge with a crown signified the award as a &quot;King&#x27;s Scout&quot;, on the left sleeve. The First Class Scout had to pass the Guide&#x27;s badge, and any three of: Ambulance, Bugler, Cyclist, Marksman, Seaman, and Signaller. From 1911, it was proposed that one troop from each of the countries of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa would be awarded a Challenge Standard of the name of &quot;King&#x27;s troop&quot;, where the troop had no less than 24 boys, and each King&#x27;s Scout must have been a member of the troop for at least six months.

From early-1919 to at least the mid-1920s, there briefly existed a &quot;King&#x27;s Sea Scout&quot; badge for the Sea Scout branch alongside the King&#x27;s Scout Award. Badges for both could be earned by a Sea Scout. After the formal establishment of the Senior Scout section in 1946, only Senior Scouts (or Boy Scouts over 15 years of age) could become King&#x27;s Scouts. Under the reign of Elizabeth II the uniform award emblem normally consisted of a stylised St Edward&#x27;s Crown. The award was renamed from King&#x27;s Scout to Queen&#x27;s Scout by April 1952, with the succession and approval of Queen Elizabeth II. Since 1947, individuals who achieve the King&#x27;s Scout or Queen&#x27;s Scout award receive a certificate with a facsimile signature of the monarch at that time. The certificate for a King&#x27;s Scout, headed by a stylised Royal coat of arms of the monarch, stated:
:AS A KING&#x27;S SCOUT you have prepared yourself for service to God and your fellow-men, and have shown yourself a worthy member of the great SCOUT BROTHERHOOD. I wish you God-speed on your journey through life; may it prove for you a joyous adventure.

==United Kingdom==
The King&#x27;s Scout Award in the United Kingdom is the ultimate goal of a progressive award scheme and is achieved by completing the following requirements through The Scout Association:

* Be 16 or over to start this award and be under 25 to complete it as well as still being a member of the Association.
* Be a member of Explorer Scouts or the Scout Network or both for at least 18 months.
* Complete 18 nights away as an Explorer Scout or member of the Scout Network, of which 12 must be camping.
* Complete six activities from a list of International, Environment and Values activities, two from each topic area.
** Holders of the Chief Scout&#x27;s Platinum Award only need to complete four activities from the list, and holders of the Chief Scout&#x27;s Diamond Award only need to complete two. The activities should be different from those completed as part of the other awards.
* Hold the Gold Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award, or complete the five King&#x27;s Scout Award Challenges, which are:
** Take up a Skill for 6 or 12 months and show progress and lasting interest.
** Take up a Physical Activity for 6 or 12 months.
** All members should complete 12 months of either the Physical or the Skill.
** Provide Service to an individual or the community for 12 months.
** Plan, complete and review a four-day and three-night expedition in open or adventurous country by foot, cycle, horse, canoe, kayak, boat or dinghy.
** Complete a five-day and four-night residential project in an unfamiliar environment with people who are not known.
* Following completion of the first four elements of the Award, make a presentation, to a suitable audience, of your achievements so far in working towards the King&#x27;s Scout Award.

Explorer Scouts and members of the Scout Network who are not holders of the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Silver Award or the Chief Scout&#x27;s Diamond Award must complete an extra six months in either the Service or the longer of the Skills or Physical Recreation Challenge. Upon the succession of King Charles III in September 2022, the award in the United Kingdom was renamed &quot;King&#x27;s Scout&quot;. The first King&#x27;s Scout in England was awarded to patrol leader Victor Watkins, of Broadstone, Dorset, on or before January 1910. The first person to hold both the Queen&#x27;s Guide Award and the Queen&#x27;s Scout Award was Susan Parker of 1st Brantham Panthers Venture Scout Unit in 1980.

==Australia==
Historically, it is given the first Australasian King&#x27;s Scout was in New Zealand by August 1910. By October 1910, at least one troop in Australia had two King&#x27;s Scouts, the 1st Kensington Troop, Adelaide. The first King&#x27;s Scout in Queensland was awarded by June 1911. Those scouts were then eligible to complete 21 badges to be awarded the &#x27;Silver Wolf&#x27;.

The Award Scheme is designed for Venturer Scouts, formerly called Senior Scouts. Its aim is to widen the interests and knowledge of Venturer Scouts. Its rationale is based on the aim and methods of Scouting allowing fun, variety, personal choice and to assist in planning for a balanced program. It is a system designed to be challenging and encouraging for people over a wide range of activities. The Queen&#x27;s Scout Award requires the Scout to complete a number of achievements in the Venturer Scout Award Scheme. These are:
* Completion of Program Essentials – Milestone 3
* Twelve progressions in the Outdoor Adventure Skills. This must include achieving at least Stage 5 in each of the Core skills of:
** Bushcraft (Pioneering and/or Survival Skills), 
** Bushwalking, and Camping, if not previously completed
** This must include at least four achievements of Stage 4 or higher in any stream
* Six Special Interest Area projects
* An Adventurous Journey
* A Leadership or Personal Development Course
* A Personal Reflection

Approval may be required from the youth member&#x27;s unit council, the district venturer council or a separate examiner. This peer review aims to maintain good standards for the award. A number of the requirements of the Venturer Scout Award Scheme, and thus the peak award itself, are mapped to competencies in the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), which allows award recipients to apply for several nationally-recognised qualifications in vocational areas such as Business, Active Volunteering and Outdoor Recreation.

An adult leader who has earned the King&#x27;s Scout Badge, the Queen&#x27;s Scout Badge or the Queen&#x27;s Scout Award (as a youth member) is entitled to wear a miniature replica of the cloth badge on their uniform. Following the death of her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, it was announced in September 2024, the award would be renamed from the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Scout Award&quot; to the &quot;King&#x27;s Scout Award&quot; by King Charles III when he accepted the Royal Patronage of the Scout Association of Australia.

==Canada==

Initially the King&#x27;s Scout Award, Scouts Canada changed the Queen&#x27;s Scout Award (during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II) into the Queen&#x27;s Venturer Award in 1968, when the Scout programme was divided into the Scout and Venturer programmes. The award is presented to venturers who have acquired competence and skills that will be of considerable use to themselves, their company, and their community. These venturers will have also been recognized by the company, the advisor, and Scouts Canada as being worthy of receiving the award. The certificate is signed by the governor general of Canada, in the official capacity as the Chief Scout of Canada.

==Hong Kong ==
The Queen&#x27;s Scout award was awarded in Hong Kong for the Venture Scout section before 1 April 1997. The Royal Certificate (Queen&#x27;s Scout Award certificate) was awarded in the Hong Kong Scout Rally or on St George&#x27;s Day (before 1987), by the Governor of Hong Kong. A Scout Leader who was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Scout Award could have worn a Queen&#x27;s Scout Leader&#x27;s insignia on their uniform. After 1997, it was replaced with the HKSAR Scout Award. The name of the current award was revised again in 2008, due to the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, to the Dragon Scout Award.

== Malaysia ==

Until 1957, Malaya was part of the British Empire, and scouts may have been earned the King&#x27;s Scout or Queen&#x27;s Scout Award. Since gaining independence from the United Kingdom, Malaysia&#x27;s King&#x27;s Scout Award is conferred in the name of the Royal Patron of the Scouts Association of Malaysia, His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (unofficially, the King of Malaysia). The King&#x27;s Scout Certificate is signed by His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia and all the sultans in Malaysia.

== New Zealand ==

The first King&#x27;s Scout in New Zealand was Sergeant Rennie, First Woolston Troop; and given to be the first scout in Australasia. Venturer section members were eligible to achieve the King&#x27;s Scout Badge, then from 1952, the Queen&#x27;s Scout Award. It included completing modules on road safety, environmental awareness, personal development and community service. In 2020, the award was renamed as the Queen&#x27;s Scout Kauri Award.

== Singapore ==

Until 1963, Singapore was part of the British Empire, then becoming part of Malaysia, and in 1965, becoming its own republic. Before 1965, scouts earned the King&#x27;s Scout (1926–1951) or Queen&#x27;s Scout (1952–1966) Awards. After independence, the award was renamed the &#x27;President&#x27;s Scout Award&#x27; in 1967. This award is separate to the Rover Scout section&#x27;s Award.

== South Africa == 

Scouts in South Africa earned the King&#x27;s Scout (1910–1951) or Queen&#x27;s Scout (1952–1961) Awards. Upon becoming the Republic of South Africa on 31 May 1961, the award&#x27;s name and insignia was changed to the Springbok Award.

<doc id="1248995" wikidata="Q948790" url="?curid=1248995" title="Rangipo Desert">
<text>Te Onetapu (), commonly known as the Rangipo Desert (), is a barren desert-like environment located in New Zealand, located in the Ruapehu District on the North Island Volcanic Plateau; to the east of the three active peaks of Mount Tongariro, Mount Ngauruhoe, and Mount Ruapehu, and to the west of the Kaimanawa Range.
==Etymology==
Two main names have been given to the desert, both of which are derived from te reo Māori and describe the area&#x27;s history. The first of these, Te Onetapu, is derived from the words - beach or sand, and - sacred. This name refers to the death of Taiteariki, an ancestor of the Ngāti Rangi iwi who was killed at a location in the desert in early Māori history after conflict arose between him and two children of Houmea, Tura and Rotuia.

Following Pākehā settlement and expansion into the region, the desert became known as Rangipo, from the Māori words , meaning sky, and , meaning night or darkness. This name references the story of Ngātoro-i-rangi, a and ancestor of Ngāti Tūwharetoa who explored the region in search of land for his people. According to legend, Ngātoro-i-rangi saw explorers from the &quot;Tākitimu&quot; while camping on Mount Tongariro, and pleaded to Ruaumoko for help defending the area from the encroachment. Ruaumoko responded by causing Mount Ngauruhoe to erupt, darkening the sky and enveloping the new party in smoke and ash.

In 2019, the desert&#x27;s original name of Te Onetapu was officially restored as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the Crown and Ngāti Rangi.
==Geography and climate==
The Rangipo Desert receives of rainfall per year, but resembles a desert because of its location on the volcanic plateau adjacent to and east of Ruapehu, poor soil quality and drying winds, and also due to the mass sterilisation of seeds during a series of violent eruptions, particularly ignimbrite flows about 20,000 years ago. The vegetation is low and sparse, consisting of mainly tussock and snow grasses. The headwaters of many small streams, which later turn into large rivers, gouge deep serrated valleys through the unconsolidated ash and pumice-rich earth. The climate here is harsh and alpine, with close to 270 ground frosts per year in comparison with fewer than 30 in the coastal regions of Hawke&#x27;s Bay, to the east. Heavy snowfalls - rarely seen in the rest of the island - are also a common occurrence in winter. Trampers and climbers in the area should be mindful of the extreme chill effect of the cold south wind which can produce wind chill factors lowering the temperature below 0°C (32°F) for days on end.

Much of the desert lies at an altitude of over , and a considerable proportion of it is over above sea level. Many of the North Island&#x27;s largest rivers have their headwaters in the area, particularly around the slopes of Mount Ruapehu, the North Island&#x27;s highest mountain. These include the Waikato and Whangaehu Rivers, as well as major tributaries of the Rangitikei and Whanganui Rivers.

==Human interaction==
The region is largely uninhabited, possibly due to the unproductive nature of the extreme winter climate. One account of crossing the desert from an early Pākehā explorer in the region described it as &quot;a most desolate and weird-looking spot... a fit place for Macbeth&#x27;s witches, or Faustus&#x27;s Brocken scene.&quot; The town of Waiouru, with its army camp, lies to the south and much of the southern part of the desert is used for training purposes. To the north of the desert lies the Rangipo prison farm.

The desert is bisected by only one sealed road, a section of State Highway 1 known as the &quot;Desert Road&quot;. The road is closed with barrier arms for short periods most winters, due to severe snow storms and icy road conditions. Turangi emergency services monitor the northern part of the Desert Road, and the NZDF Military Police at Waiouru are responsible for the southern end. The boundary between the Waikato and Manawatū-Whanganui regions intersects the Desert Road at its summit, which at above sea level is the highest pass on the New Zealand State Highway network.

The &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films were shot in New Zealand, and the Black Gate of Mordor scenes were shot in the Rangipo Desert in 2000.

<text>Jørgen Juve (22 November 1906 – 12 April 1983) was a Norwegian football player, jurist, journalist, and non-fiction writer. For most of his career, he played as a striker for Lyn. He also played for a season at Basel in Switzerland before retiring and earned a total of 45 caps for the Norway national team. He is the second highest-scoring player ever for Norway, with 33 goals in just 45 games, holding the record for most international goals in Norway from 1932 until 2024, when Erling Haaland surpassed his record. He was captain of the Norway team which won Olympic bronze medals in the 1936 Summer Olympics. He also had a career as a journalist for &quot;Dagbladet&quot; and &quot;Tidens Tegn&quot;, and wrote several books.

==Personal life==
Juve was born in Porsgrunn; the son of tanner Ole Martin Juve and Marie Pøhner. The family name originates from the farm Juve/Djuve in Lårdal, where his grandfather was born. He was the eldest of six children. His two brothers both emigrated to the United States, while his three sisters married and settled in Norway. Among his childhood friends was later composer Klaus Egge. He was married twice, first to Erna Riberg in 1932, and they had two children. One of their grandchildren is folk singer Tone Juve. He was later married to the psychologist Eva Røine, and they had one daughter. He died in Oslo in 1983.

==Sports career==
Juve started playing football for the Porsgrunn sports club Urædd, only 16 years old. In 1926 he moved to Oslo, where he started playing for the club Lyn. Juve played in the Norwegian Cup final for Lyn in 1928, but the team lost 2–1 against Ørn-Horten. During the season 1930–1931 he played 12 games for FC Basel in which he scored 10 goals.

He made 45 appearances and scored 33 international goals for the Norway national team between 1928 and 1937. His first match for the national team was against Finland in June 1928, and his 45th match was against Denmark in June 1937. Juve scored his first goals for Norway in June 1929, when he scored a hat-trick against Netherlands, and during the next seven matches he scored 16 goals. His 33 goals made Juve the Norway national team all time top scorer for over 90 years, until his record was finally beaten by Erling Haaland in 2024. He only played as a striker in 22 of those games; the rest he alternated between right-back and centre-half.

He was captain of the team that won bronze medals at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. In the first round of the Olympics, 3 August, the Norwegian team met Turkey, and won the match 4–0. In the second round they met Germany, and won this match 2–0. Both goals were scored by Magnar Isaksen (after 8 and 84 minutes). Among the spectators were Hitler and Goebbels. It was the first and last time Hitler watched a football match. In the semifinal, on 10 August, the Norwegian team lost 1–2 to Italy, after extra time. Finally the team won 3–2 over Poland in the bronze final. In 2006, on the occasion of the 100-year anniversary of Juve&#x27;s birth Per Ravn Omdal stated that Juve was one of the greatest Norwegian footballers while Sondre Kåfjord, Per Jorsett, Ola Dybwad Olsen and Arne Scheie named Juve as the most important contributor to Norway&#x27;s only medal in an international football championship for men.

Juve retired from football in 1938, then coached Bodø/Glimt in 1939. He coached Molde FK for a few weeks in 1948.

In September 2024, Norway&#x27;s anti-doping agency mistakenly included Juve and Einar Gundersen on a list of football players to be tested. The agency&#x27;s communications director said, &quot;All we can do now is admit we&#x27;re wrong. We can joke about it in the office today and then review our routines going forward.&quot;

==Writing career==
In 1931, Juve obtained a law degree in Basel, and would later work as a journalist and writer. He was sports editor for the newspaper &quot;Dagbladet&quot; from 1928 to 1934, and for &quot;Tidens Tegn&quot; from 1934 to 1940. During World War II Juve started the weekly magazine &quot;Bragd&quot;. In 1941 he moved to Stockholm, where he edited the magazine &quot;Norges-Nytt&quot;. In 1942 he travelled to London, and later to New York.

He worked as a journalist for &quot;Dagbladet&quot; from 1945. Among his books are &quot;Alt om fotball&quot; from 1934, &quot;Norsk fotball&quot; from 1937, and &quot;Øyeblikk&quot; from 1978. In &quot;Øyeblikk&quot; (&quot;Moments&quot;) Juve describes memorable moments, such as when Birger Ruud won the men&#x27;s downhill and Laila Schou Nilsen won the women&#x27;s downhill at the 1936 Winter Olympics. From the football match against Germany in 1936 he reminisced on how some German players stopped playing and saluted when Hitler appeared. He edited a book on Ole Reistad in 1959. Juve was also a minor ballot candidate for the Liberal Party in the 1949 Norwegian parliamentary election.

<doc id="1249014" wikidata="Q663469" url="?curid=1249014" title="Knife in the Water">
<text>Knife in the Water () is a 1962 Polish psychological thriller film co-written and directed by Roman Polanski in his feature debut, and starring Leon Niemczyk, Jolanta Umecka, and Zygmunt Malanowicz. Its plot follows a husband and wife who are accompanied on a boating trip by a young male hitchhiker, who spurs a number of escalating confrontations between the couple.

The film was nominated for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and is Polanski&#x27;s only Polish-language feature to date. &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; has garnered acclaim from film critics since its release, and is one of Polanski&#x27;s best-reviewed works. American filmmaker Martin Scorsese recognized the film as one of the masterpieces of Polish cinema and in 2013 he selected it for screening alongside films such as Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Innocent Sorcerers&quot; in the United States, Canada and United Kingdom as part of the &quot;Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema&quot; festival of Polish films.

==Plot==
Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) are driving to a lake to go sailing when they come upon a young man (Zygmunt Malanowicz) hitchhiking in the middle of the road. After nearly hitting him, Andrzej invites the young man along. When they arrive at the lake, instead of leaving the young man behind, Andrzej invites him to go sailing with them. The young man accepts the offer, and, not knowing much about sailing, must learn many hard lessons from Andrzej.

Meanwhile, tension gradually builds between Andrzej and the hitchhiker as they vie for the attentions of Krystyna. The title refers to the major turning point in the film when Andrzej taunts the young man with the latter&#x27;s treasured pocket knife, which is accidentally lost overboard. A fight ensues between Andrzej and the hitchhiker, and the latter falls into the water. Andrzej and his wife search for him but cannot find him and assume that he has drowned since earlier he said that he could not swim. Andrzej and his wife quarrel about what to do, and Andrzej swims to shore to fetch the police. When the young man realizes that Andrzej has gone, he comes out from hiding behind a buoy on the lake and swims to the yacht. There he sees Krystyna naked, drying off. He boards the yacht, and Krystyna tells him he is as bad as Andrzej, but sexual attraction wins out and they have sex, off-screen.

Krystyna sails back to the dock, and the man jumps off and goes on his way before Andrzej appears and takes charge again. He wants to go to the police to report the young man missing. Krystyna tells him that the young man returned and she was unfaithful. Andrzej does not know what to believe, and at the road junction, where they would turn one way to return home and another to go to the police station, the car does not move.

==Cast==
* Leon Niemczyk as Andrzej
* Jolanta Umecka as Krystyna
* Zygmunt Malanowicz as Young Man
* Anna Ciepielewska as Krystyna (voice)
* Roman Polanski as Young Man (voice)

==Analysis==
Film professor Charles Derry notes that &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; is atypical from other thrillers due to the fact that it &quot;represses the usual violence promised by the thriller, [and] it ends its narrative with violence&#x27;s opposite: a scene of total stasis, in which no action is perfectly acceptable to the husband protagonist.&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
The screenplay for the film, written by Polanski, Jakub Goldberg, and Jerzy Skolimowski, was initially rejected by the Polish Ministry of Culture due to its &quot;lack of social commitment.&quot; Unable to obtain funding in his native Poland, Polanski reworked the screenplay to be set in France, though the production was ultimately unable to receive funding there as well. After making a number of minor edits to the screenplay—mainly snippets of dialogue demonstrating &quot;social commitment&quot; to &quot;appease the Ministry [of Culture]&quot;—Polanski again pitched the project to the national film board, who approved it for production.

===Filming===
&quot;Knife in the Water&quot; was shot by Polanski in 1961 using only three actors. Two of the actors (Jolanta Umecka, who plays Krystyna and Zygmunt Malanowicz, who plays the young man) had virtually no previous professional acting experience.

Being filmed on the water (in the Polish Masurian Lake District), and largely within the confines of a sailboat and life raft, the film was technically difficult. While the sailboat was large enough for the three actors, it was quite cramped for the film crew, who often had to hang over the side of the boat with safety harnesses in order to shoot.

===Music===
Krzysztof Komeda composed the film&#x27;s music and the featured saxophonist was Bernt Rosengren.

==Release==
&quot;Knife in the Water&quot; was released theatrically in Poland on 9 March 1962. It premiered in the United States the following year, on 28 October 1963.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Knife in the Water&quot; was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 1963 Academy Awards, the first Polish motion picture to receive this kind of recognition. &quot;Time&quot; used a still from the film, with Umecka and Malanowicz on the verge of a kiss, as the cover of an issue featuring international cinema. It won the FIPRESCI Prize in 1962 Venice Film Festival. The film has been included in lists of the best debut feature films and was ranked number 61 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 97% approval rating based on 34 reviews, with an average score of 8.3/10.

In 2014, Martin Scorsese selected &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; to be screened as part of the festival of Polish films in the United States and Canada entitled &quot;Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema&quot;.

In the 2015 poll conducted by Polish Museum of Cinematography in Łódź, &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; was ranked as the fourth greatest Polish film of all time.

===Home media===
&quot;Knife in the Water&quot; was released on VHS in 1996, and on DVD in 2003 by The Criterion Collection.

==Related works==
&quot;Knife in the Water&quot; was the basis for a low budget 2001 American film &quot;Kaaterskill Falls&quot;, set in the Catskill Mountains.

Polański himself had an offer to make an English-language, colour remake, with a Hollywood cast (including Henry Fonda), but he refused, saying he did not want to do a remake of a movie that was already good.

<doc id="1249019" wikidata="Q2171744" url="?curid=1249019" title="Killer Klowns from Outer Space">
<text>Killer Klowns from Outer Space is a 1988 American science fiction comedy horror film produced by the Chiodo Brothers, who also created the practical effects and makeup, with Stephen directing from a script he co-wrote with Charles; it is the only film written or directed by any of the Chiodos. The film features an ensemble cast starring Grant Cramer, Suzanne Snyder, John Allen Nelson and John Vernon. It concerns evil extraterrestrials that resemble clowns arriving on Earth and invading a small town in order to capture, kill and harvest the human inhabitants for sustenance.

&quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot; was filmed in Watsonville, California and at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. The film utilizes practical effects, including creature suits. The score was composed by John Massari. The film received generally positive reviews and has been considered a cult classic.

Sequels have been in development hell since the original film&#x27;s release. Stephen Chiodo stated in 2016 that he hopes to produce three additional films, or possibly a television series. In 2018, NBCUniversal&#x27;s Syfy announced that it was in talks to license the rights to make one or more sequels.

==Plot==
Just outside the Californian town of Crescent Cove, Mike Tobacco and his girlfriend Debbie Stone are spending time at the local lovers&#x27; lane when they witness the arrival of a strange glowing object. Nearby, a farmer, perceiving it as Halley&#x27;s Comet, ventures into the woods to find the impact site. He stumbles upon a large circus tent-like structure, during which he and his dog are captured by clown-like aliens known as &quot;Klowns&quot;. Arriving to investigate for themselves, Mike and Debbie enter the structure and discover a complex interior with bizarre rooms, eventually realizing that it is the object and a spaceship. They find the now-fleshless farmer encased in a cocoon made out of a cotton candy-like substance and are discovered by a Klown, which shoots popcorn at them from a bazooka-like weapon and then pursues them, aided by another one.

Narrowly escaping to the local police station, they report the incident to one of the officers and Debbie&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, Dave Hansen, and his curmudgeonly partner, Curtis Mooney. Mike takes Dave to the site of the ship, only to find it missing with a large crater left in its place, prompting Dave to apprehend Mike for his supposed tall tale. The duo then travel to the lovers&#x27; lane, only to find it abandoned and one of the cars filled with the cocoon&#x27;s substance, proving the Klowns&#x27; existence and Mike&#x27;s innocence. All the while, the Klowns are seen encasing townspeople in more of their cocoons using toy-like rayguns. Several of them pull pranks and mock circus acts, which result in the deaths of several onlookers.

Mike and Dave eventually witness a Klown using a form of shadow puppetry to shrink a crowd of people at a bus stop, then dump them into a bag full of popcorn, which are later revealed to be its species&#x27; larval form. Back at the police station, another Klown arrives and Mooney arrests it, believing it to be a teenage prankster. Dave soon returns to the station and encounters the Klown using a deceased Mooney as a ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy before shooting its fragile nose, which causes the alien to spin around wildly and explode into confetti upon its shattering.

Mike meets with his friends, Rich and Paul Terenzi, and, using the public address system on their ice cream truck, they drive around town attempting to warn people of the Klowns. At Debbie&#x27;s house, some of the Klowns&#x27; larvae from her and Mike&#x27;s earlier encounter with them evolves into juvenile Klowns and attacks her. As she attempts to escape, she is intercepted by the other Klowns, who detain her in a giant balloon. Mike, the Terenzi brothers and Dave witness Debbie&#x27;s capture and give chase, following the Klowns to the local amusement park, where they have relocated their ship. Journeying through a funhouse, the Terenzis become separated. After Dave and Mike infiltrate the ship and witness a Klown using a drinking straw to drink the blood of one of their cocooned victims, they rescue Debbie and flee deeper into it.

The trio find themselves surrounded by a legion of Klowns, but the Terenzis arrive in their ice cream truck and attempt to distract them. The Klowns&#x27; gargantuan leader, Jojo the Klownzilla, soon appears and destroys the truck, seemingly killing the brothers; Dave creates a distraction as Mike and Debbie escape before the ship begins to take off. Dave then uses his police badge to shatter Jojo&#x27;s nose, vanquishing it and resulting in the ship being destroyed. The Klowns&#x27; car then drops out of the sky and Dave emerges along with the Terenzis, the latter of whom miraculously survived by hiding in the ice cream truck&#x27;s freezer moments before it was destroyed.

As Dave and his friends watch the fireworks created by the ship&#x27;s destruction, pies fall from the sky and land on their faces.

==Cast==
==Production==

The &quot;from Outer Space&quot; part of the film&#x27;s title was initially left out, but was ultimately kept in so audiences would not assume it was a slasher film. Filming took place in the city of Watsonville and at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. The film was Christopher Titus&#x27; first role in a motion picture. The popcorn gun used by one of the Klowns in the film, which included a compressor that would allow the weapon to actually propel popcorn, was the most expensive prop made for the production, costing seven thousand dollars to create and taking six weeks to build. The legs of the Klowns&#x27; sentient balloon animal dog were coated in latex by the film&#x27;s special effects department in order to keep it from popping on the pine needles that covered the ground.

While the Chiodo Brothers were well-known as special effects artists, much of the special effects work was carried out by other artists, allowing the brothers to focus more on their production duties. However, the brothers did personally construct the miniature set for the &quot;Klownzilla&quot; sequence.

Most of the vehicles used in the film were rented and therefore were not allowed to be damaged. A pair of cars were accidentally damaged; one was driven off a bridge, although it was only intended to roll a short distance, and the Jeep filled with the cotton candy cocoons&#x27; substance needed three thousand dollars worth of repairs after solvent in the material damaged the interior.

The Chiodo Brothers wanted to cast comedian Soupy Sales as the local amusement park&#x27;s security guard killed by the Klowns&#x27; acidic pies, as he was known for receiving pies in the face on his children&#x27;s television show &quot;Lunch with Soupy Sales&quot;. However, the executive producers did not want to allocate funds to pay for Sales&#x27; plane ticket to the production, as they felt that audiences would not know who Sales was.

Jojo the Klownzilla, the Klowns&#x27; gargantuan leader who appears in the film&#x27;s climax, was originally intended to be created using stop-motion animation, but was instead portrayed by Charles Chiodo in a creature suit. In the film&#x27;s original finale, Dave was killed in the destruction of the Klowns&#x27; ship, but this was changed after audiences in test screenings desired a more upbeat ending.

Four molds were made for the main Klowns&#x27; heads. One was peanut shaped, another was triangular, another circular and the final shape was an inverted triangle. From those four molds the effects artists produced a pair of specific Klowns each. Klownzilla had its own mask molded specifically for its appearance.

Two of the masks that were used for the Klowns in the film were allegedly re-purposed and used to portray the trolls of &quot;Ernest Scared Stupid&quot;. However, in a 2023 Zoom Q&amp;A at the Little Theatre in Rochester, NY, Stephen Chiodo said that the only things potentially reused were some ear props, with the resemblance in masks being purely coincidental.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s score was composed by John Massari. The title song &quot;Killer Klowns&quot; was written and performed by the American punk rock band the Dickies and was released on their album &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot; in 1988. Frontman Leonard Phillips wrote the song without seeing the movie. A limited-edition complete soundtrack was released in 2006 through Percepto Records and features twenty-six tracks of the score, the title song &quot;Killer Klowns&quot;, and four bonus tracks at a running time just over sixty-nine minutes. The score was later released by Waxwork Records on a vinyl LP.

==Release==
&quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot; was released in the United States on May 27, 1988. The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc by Media Home Entertainment in 1989, and then by MGM Home Entertainment in 2000 as part of their &quot;Midnite Movies&quot; line, and on DVD on August 28, 2001. MGM released the film on Blu-ray on September 11, 2012.

On May 25, 2013, the film received a 35 mm screening at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Vintage Park in Houston, Texas, as well as a 35 mm screening at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Yonkers, New York on June 20, 2014.

On April 9, 2018, Arrow Films released their special edition Blu-Ray of &quot;Killer Klowns From Outer Space&quot;. This release was newly restored, with interviews, documentary featurettes, Klown auditions, bloopers, deleted scenes, a double-sided poster that features the original theatrical poster, as well as art by Sara Deck, and more.

==Critical reception==
The film has been considered a cult classic. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an average score of 79%, based on 28 critic reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot;″s title promises darkly goofy fun – and more often than not, the movie delivers.&quot; Leonard Klady of &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;demonstrates both above-average technical skill and large dollops of imagination&quot;. Film critic Leonard Maltin initially declared the film a BOMB (&quot;Strictly tenth-rate.&quot;), but gave the movie a second look after a few years; this time, Maltin awarded the picture two-and-a-half out of a possible four stars. In his second review, Maltin wrote &quot;Routinely plotted, but vividly designed, with cheeky humor ... plays its premise to the hilt, all &#x27;circus&#x27; bases touched&quot;.

Charles Bramesco of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; recommended the film, writing that &quot;The film is patently absurd, but the filmmakers are fully committed to that absurdity. It&#x27;s hard not to respect&quot;, and noted the film&#x27;s &quot;enduring appeal&quot;. Charles Webb of MTV.com called the performances &quot;a little rough&quot;, and wrote &quot;If &quot;Killer Klowns&quot; isn&#x27;t especially scary, it&#x27;s only kind of funny but still gets by on the execution of extremely inventive visuals based on the clown/circus motif&quot;. Dread Central gave the film three out of a possible five stars. JoBlo.com gave the film a rating of 8/10, stating that the film &quot;is the &quot;king&quot; of &#x27;80s B-movies and it delivers the tacky goods by the truckloads&quot;. John Gugie of HorrorNews.net gave the film a score of 3/5, calling it &quot;a hit or miss for horror and sci-fi fans&quot;.

Author Matthew Chojnacki recommended the film in his book &quot;Alternative Movie Posters: Film Art From the Underground&quot;. Jim Craddock, in his book &quot;VideoHound&#x27;s Golden Movie Retriever&quot;, gave the film two-and-a-half out of four bones, calling the film a &quot;Visually striking, campy but slick horror flick that&#x27;ll make you think twice about your next visit to the big top&quot;. Director Brian Herzlinger considers &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot; to be &quot;his favorite cult film&quot;.

==Planned sequels==
The Chiodo brothers planned to release a &quot;requel&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;remake&quot; and &quot;sequel&quot;), titled &quot;Return of the Killer Klowns from Outer Space in 3D&quot;, in 2012. Stephen Chiodo was to direct the movie, and his brother Charles would be a production designer. Grant Cramer, who starred in the original film as Mike Tobacco, stated that his character would return. According to Cramer, Tobacco now would be a town drunk, whose ramblings about the Klowns are dismissed. When the Klowns come back, Tobacco, who has been preparing for their return, teams up with two young street performers to fight them. Cramer also said that there might be multiple sequels, each revolving around a character from the original movie.

It was reported later that the release date had been delayed, but, according to the Facebook page for the film, it was &quot;officially in post-production.&quot; A page on a website for the original movie promised that the follow-up film (referred to as a sequel, rather than a &quot;requel&quot;) would be released in 2013.

In 2016 interviews, Stephen Chiodo stated that efforts to make further &quot;Killer Klowns&quot; productions had shifted, from planning one or more theatrical releases, to focus on television. He explained the concept of &quot;a trilogy in four parts, with the original film being the first,&quot; adding, &quot;We&#x27;ve got it all written out.&quot; However, he also ambiguously referred to the same plans as &quot;a long arch series for cable&quot; and &quot;a long-ranging series&quot;.

On October 22, 2018, it was announced that the Syfy channel was in talks to license the rights to make one or more sequels to &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot;, as well as additional movies in the &quot;Critters&quot; franchise.

==Legacy==
In 2005, SOTA Toys announced they would produce Killer Klown figurines as part of their Now Playing film action figures line. One figure was produced in 2006. After SOTA stopped producing the toys, Amok Time took over until 2017, when the company announced that its license to produce Killer Klown figures had expired. Both Klown and Shorty figures have become high-end collectibles, and are much sought after by collectors.

John Massari, the composer of the synthesizer-filled score for the movie, rerecorded the music with a full orchestra at Warner Brothers Studios in 2016.

In 2018, Klowns, as well as the infamous ice cream truck from the film, were featured in a &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot;-themed &quot;scare zone&quot; at Universal Orlando&#x27;s 28th annual Halloween Horror Nights event. On July 25, 2019, it was announced that the &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot; scare zone of the previous year would be expanded into a full-fledged haunted house attraction for the 2019 event at both the Orlando and Hollywood locations. Later in August, it was revealed that exclusive &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot; merchandise would be sold during Halloween Horror Nights. The haunted house later returned for the 2022 edition of Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood.

Since 2021, Spirit Halloween has dedicated a section of its seasonal stores to merchandise tied to the movie. In addition to costumes, statues, prop replicas, doormats, signage, and life-sized animatronic characters have been featured.

In August 2022, it was revealed that an asymmetrical multiplayer game based on the film was being developed by Teravision Games and published by Good Shepherd Entertainment with a planned release in 2024 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. It was announced in August 2023 that IllFonic was brought onto the project to relieve Good Shepherd from publishing duties as well as co-develop the game with Teravision. The game, officially titled &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game&quot;, was released on June 4, 2024.

<doc id="1249023" wikidata="Q274128" url="?curid=1249023" title="Geoffrey Wilkinson">
<text>Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson FRS (14 July 1921 – 26 September 1996) was a Nobel laureate English chemist who pioneered inorganic chemistry and homogeneous transition metal catalysis.

==Education and early life==
Wilkinson was born at Springside, Todmorden, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. His father, Henry Wilkinson, was a master house painter and decorator; his mother, Ruth, worked in a local cotton mill. One of his uncles, an organist and choirmaster, had married into a family that owned a small chemical company making Epsom and Glauber&#x27;s salts for the pharmaceutical industry; this is where he first developed an interest in chemistry.

He was educated at the local council primary school and, after winning a County Scholarship in 1932, went to Todmorden Grammar School. His physics teacher there, Luke Sutcliffe, had also taught Sir John Cockcroft, who received a Nobel Prize for &quot;splitting the atom&quot;. In 1939 he obtained a Royal Scholarship for study at Imperial College London, from where he graduated in 1941, with his PhD awarded in 1946 entitled &quot;Some physico-chemical observations of hydrolysis in the homogeneous vapour phase&quot;.

==Career and research==
In 1942 Professor Friedrich Paneth was recruiting young chemists for the nuclear energy project. Wilkinson joined and was sent out to Canada, where he stayed in Montreal and later Chalk River Laboratories until he could leave in 1946. For the next four years he worked with Professor Glenn T. Seaborg at University of California, Berkeley, mostly on nuclear taxonomy. He then became a research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began to return to his first interest as a student – transition metal complexes of ligands such as carbon monoxide and olefins.

He was at Harvard University from September 1951 until he returned to England in December 1955, with a sabbatical break of nine months in Copenhagen. At Harvard, he still did some nuclear work on excitation functions for protons in cobalt, but had already begun to work on olefin complexes.

In June 1955 he was appointed to the chair of Inorganic Chemistry at Imperial College London, and from then on worked almost entirely on the complexes of transition metals.
Wilkinson is well known for his popularisation of the use of Wilkinson&#x27;s catalyst RhCl(PPh3)3 in catalytic hydrogenation, and for the discovery of the structure of ferrocene. Wilkinson&#x27;s catalyst is used industrially in the hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes.

He supervised PhD students and postdoctoral researchers including John A. Osborn, Alan Davison and Malcolm Green.

==Awards and honours==
Wilkinson received many awards, including the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1973 for his work on &quot;organometallic compounds&quot; (with Ernst Otto Fischer). He is also well known for writing, with his former doctoral student F. Albert Cotton, &quot;Advanced Inorganic Chemistry&quot;, often referred to simply as &quot;Cotton and Wilkinson&quot;, one of the standard inorganic chemistry textbooks.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1965. In 1980 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Bath. Imperial College London named a new hall of residence after him, which opened in October 2009. Wilkinson Hall is named in his honour.

==Personal life==
Wilkinson was married to Lise Schou, a Danish plant physiologist whom he had met at Berkeley. They had two daughters, Anne and Pernille.

<text>Fantasy Warlord is a fantasy miniatures game released in 1990 by Folio Works. It was written by Ian Bailey and Gary Chalk who also did the illustrations.

The game was designed and published by two ex-Games Workshop (GW) employees who disagreed with the much more commercial direction that company was taking. It was supposed to rival the &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot; game that GW published.

&quot;Fantasy Warlord&quot; featured some unusual game mechanics such as simultaneous movement, an original command and control system (units are organised into brigades commanded by characters) and fog of war rules. It also featured balanced magic and troop choice systems. However the balance within the combat system reduced the opportunity to generate dramatic victories.

Much like &quot;Warhammer&quot;, the game had its own fantasy world, called Vortimax, in which the battles were imagined to take place. There was also a related range of &quot;Fantasy Warlord&quot; miniatures cast by Alternative Armies, and a magazine called &quot;Red Giant&quot;.

The game went out of print 18 months after first publication. Some supplements were expected, such as &quot;Armies of Vortimax&quot; (expected in 1992) &quot;Besieged&quot; or &quot;Fantasy Warlord Command Pack&quot;, but none were released. Only two issues of &quot;Red Giant&quot; magazine were released. Folio Works Ltd. was dissolved on 11 February 1993.

==Publication history==
Gary Chalk and Ian Bailey created &quot;Fantasy Warlord&quot; (1990) to compete with Games Workshop&#x27;s &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot;.

==The Rulebook==

===Content===

Fantasy Warlord is a single softback book of 192-pages mostly printed in black and white with a Gary Chalk front cover. The book is divided in two parts: the first one covers the game&#x27;s rules and the second part describes the fantasy world of Vortimax, where the battles take place. 16 pull-out soft cards are attached at the back of the book, one for each racial type plus templates and orders counters.

The book contains many illustrations from Gary Chalk and photographs that illustrate troop&#x27;s formations, movements, etc.

Determining the abilities of troop is easy: you choose their morale class (A = veterans, B = trained or C = militia) weapons and armour from 11 different races (Human, Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs...). Monsters (flying or not), pack animals and daemons were also available. More races were expected in the supplement &quot;Armies of Vortimax&quot;.

Generation of heroes or wizards is more time-consuming. There are six types of characters: Warrior Heroes, Priests, Warrior Priests, Magic-users, Thieves and Discipline Masters. Skills and attributes are determined by their level of experience: they could be Minor, Major or Master.

Nearly sixty magic artifacts or weapons and more than 100 spells are available to equip characters.

Each turn is divided into 11 phases. Unlike Warhammer Fantasy Battle, movements are made simultaneously, the players using counters to issue orders. Units are organised into brigades which are commanded by characters. As the game progresses, characters gradually lose control of their brigades, as they would do in real battlefield.

The combat system does not rely solely on random results and copious dice rolling, but rather emphasises strategy and tactics, balanced races, and unit control in order to determine the outcome of a battle.

The book was sold $29.99 in the United States and £13,95 in Great Britain.

====Book One: The Rules====

The first part of the rulebook is divided into 12 chapters:

* Introduction
* Creating an army
* Army organisation
* Into battle
* Orders
* Movement
* Battlefield terrain
* Missile fire
* Combat
* Morale
* Magic
* Tactical hints &amp; terrain generation

====Book Two: The World of Vortimax====

The second part of the rulebook offers a background for Fantasy Warlord and contains descriptions of geography, history and realms of Vortimax and races that could be played.

===Supplements===

At least 3 supplements were anticipated, but none of them were printed.

* &quot;Armies of Vortimax&quot;, expected in 1992 and already announced in &quot;The Games Quarterly Catalog&quot; 1991 Christmas Edition
* &quot;Besieged&quot;, adding rules for war machines and siege
* &quot;Fantasy Warlord Command Pack&quot;

====High Command====

A science-fiction skirmish game probably based on Fantasy Warlord&#x27;s system, High Command, was expected in 1992 but never released. A small miniatures range was available alongside that of Fantasy Warlord. Those science-fiction figures are currently available from SHQ miniatures (Space Ratten, Saurian Militia and Human Earth Guard)

==Critical Reaction==

&quot;Fantasy Warlord&quot; was not well received by critics, citing problems ranging from the racial-types not affecting melee, movement being overly complicated, and the cover artwork being &quot;garish&quot;.

According to Gary Chalk in a recent interview, producing Fantasy Warlord cost him a lot of money and stress. Ian Bailey and he misjudged the market dominated by Games Workshop&#x27;s products and gamers did not well receive a game that used pseudo-military tactics to determine the outcome of fantasy battles.

In addition to this, the launch coincided with the release of Grenadier&#x27;s Fantasy Warriors wargame.

==Red Giant magazine==

&quot;Red Giant&quot; was a fantasy magazine published by Folio Works Ltd. which covered historical or fantasy wargamers, role-players, computer games, play by mail, or live role-playing. Unlike White Dwarf (WD) published by its competitor Games Workshop, Red Giant was not intend to support exclusively &quot;Fantasy Warlord&quot; or &quot;High Command&quot; games, but was a response to what Games Workshop and other editors did to the business, according to the company.

Just like White Dwarf did in early ages of its existence, Red Giant made room for many games, such as AD&amp;D, Runequest, Call of Cthulhu, Warhammer Fantasy Role-play and many others.

Actually, &quot;Red Giant&quot; was a sarcastic title, the exact opposite of White Dwarf, run by Games Workshop. In his first editorial, Tom Sage described WD as &quot;[one of the] magazines exclusive to their product range.&quot;

The magazine went out of print after only two issues.

== Miniatures Range ==

Folio Works launched a full range of 28 mm metal miniatures simultaneously with the publication of the rulebook, produced under license exclusively by Alternative Armies. Some of them have been sculpted by Bob Olley (it is confirmed that &quot;FW 8 Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;FW 5 Urucks&quot; and &quot;FW 9 Ogres&quot; have been designed by him).

Miniatures were sold in two kind of packages: a traditional blister carding and a less common shrink-wrap packing which offer a better view and protection of the miniatures during shipping. They were distributed in the United States and the United Kingdom.

The range uses two different codification: one for the characters (heroes and wizards) and troops in &quot;classic&quot; blister packs which consists of five digit and a second kind of code for the troops, shields and weapons prefixed with &quot;FW&quot; letters and followed by two digit, the first one designing the range (for instance: 8 for dwarfs).

Characters were sold individually with a weapon and a shield when appropriate. Troops were sold by two to five miniatures per blister, shields and weapons were cast separately to let the player chooses his troop&#x27;s weapons easily. Single miniature blisters were sold £0.80 (£1.50 for bigger miniatures such as Ogre Hero), Multipacks £2.95 and Weapon packs £1.50.

Folio Works also sold different sort of pre-cut bases and multi-bases as announced in the rulebook page 8, but there is no evidence those bases have ever been released.

When Folio Works went out of business around 1992, the rights to the miniatures were acquired by Mayhem Miniatures, and later by Kennington Miniatures and then later by &quot;SHQ&quot; and some of the miniatures are still available to purchase online (mainly Ogres and Urucks, also scenery packs).

Alternative Armies still has the original moulds and some of the miniatures, if not all from the classic blisters range, can be cast on demand.

On 20 July 2017, Alternative Armies officially announced the availability on their website of classic blisters range.

=== Fantasy Warlord Scenery Packs ===

Five resin scenery packs have been released and were cataloged in the &quot;Games Quarterly Catalog&quot; (with a typo: Barrels is spelled &quot;Varrels&quot;) and advertised and pictured in the first issue of &quot;Red Giant&quot; magazine. Some of them are also depicted in the rulebook, alongside hero figures. Each pack was sold for £2.95. This range may still be available online at who bought MBM who bought Kennington who bought some of Folio&#x27;s ranges, recently these items which mayhem had added to their fantasy range have been purchased by scotia grendel and will be rereleased in early 2020 alongside the full mayhem fantasy range (also included will be the unreleased wall and fence sections as well)

* 501 Stone Walls (5)
* 502 Wooden Fences (5)
* 503 Rune Stones (5)
* 504 Barrels and Boxes (1)
* 505 Shrine (1)

It seems that more items were available, such as wooden fence or wall stone corners, damaged walls, etc. and are still sold by Kennington.

=== Uncatalogued range ===

Alternative Armies also released between 1991 and 1992 according to the slotta&#x27;s copyright an unknown number of uncatalogued &quot;Fantasy Warlord&quot; blisters. Unlike the &#x27;official&#x27; range each blister pack contains 10 miniatures: 9 troops and one leader.

* LOL 001 ?
* LOL 002 ?
* LOL 003 ?
* LOL 004 ?
* LOL 005 Sharpes Longbows - Elves (10)
* LOL 006 ?
* LOL 007 Smollett&#x27;s Southearts - Halflings (10)
* LOL 008 Erlangen&#x27;s Brigand Band - Humans (10)
* LOL 009 ?
* LOL 010 Anaria&#x27;s Amazons (10)

It is unclear if this extra range was officially commercialised by Folio Works or cast and sold by Alternative Armies on its own initiative.

=== Erin and other miniatures range from Alternative Armies ===

Alternative Armies also sold &quot;Erin - The Game of Celtic Myth Miniatures&quot;, &quot;Shia Khan&quot; or &quot;Orcish Horde&quot; blisters mentioning that they were part of &quot;Folio Works&quot; and Fantasy Warlord&#x27;s range of miniatures. It is unclear why they used &quot;Folio Works&quot;&#x27; trademark on the back of their blisters at that time.

<doc id="1249034" wikidata="Q7551794" url="?curid=1249034" title="Socialist Unity Party of New Zealand">
<text>The Socialist Unity Party of New Zealand was one of the better-known communist parties in New Zealand. It had a certain amount of influence in the trade union movement, but never won seats in Parliament.

The Socialist Unity Party was founded in 1966 as a splinter group of the Communist Party. The Communist Party had been bitterly divided by the Sino-Soviet Split, a dispute between the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev and China under Mao Zedong. The party eventually decided to take China&#x27;s side. Shortly afterwards, a number of the more prominent supporters of the Soviet position, such as Ken Douglas, George Jackson and Bill Andersen, established the Socialist Unity Party. The Socialist Unity Party retained ideological and political links to the Soviet Union for most of its existence.

The Socialist Unity Party&#x27;s association with the Soviet government drew considerable criticism from mainstream politicians. In 1980, the Soviet ambassador to New Zealand, Vsevolod Sofinsky, was expelled after allegedly giving $10,000 to a member of the Socialist Unity Party. In 1987, another Soviet diplomat, Sergei Budnik, was ordered to leave the country by Prime Minister David Lange for his alleged involvement with the party.

At the same time, the Socialist Unity Party was strongly condemned by other communist groups, which accused it of not following &quot;true&quot; communism and of collaborating with capitalists. The Socialist Unity Party&#x27;s most well known leader, Ken Douglas, was also criticised by hardliners for the comparatively moderate position he took within the trade union movement.

The Socialist Unity Party, unlike some of the more radical groups, participated in New Zealand elections, and was not wholly antagonistic to mainstream parties — it was prepared, for example, to occasionally support the Labour Party as &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;. The party put forward candidates in four elections; generally in safe Labour seats in the four main centres; except for and in the and in the . However Bill Andersen stood against Rob Muldoon in four times.

The Socialist Unity Party has now dissolved, although the Socialist Party of Aotearoa (now also defunct), which split from the Socialist Unity Party in 1990, continued for a number of years afterwards into the early 2010s.

<doc id="1249040" wikidata="Q950934" url="?curid=1249040" title="Jimmy Ellis (boxer)">
<text>James Albert Ellis (February 24, 1940 – May 6, 2014) was an American professional boxer. He won the vacant WBA heavyweight title in 1968 by defeating Jerry Quarry, making one successful title defense in the same year against Floyd Patterson, before losing to Joe Frazier in 1970.

==Early life==
He was born one of ten children. His father, Walter, was a pastor, and Ellis was brought up as a Christian. As a teenager he worked in a cement finishing factory. He also sang in the local church choir, later joined by his wife Mary. He continued church involvement all his adult life. In his youth he admired the boxer Joe Louis.

==Amateur career==
Ellis got into boxing as a teenager after watching a friend box a fellow Louisville youngster Muhammad Ali (then known as Cassius Clay) on a local amateur boxing television show called Tomorrow&#x27;s Champions. &quot;I had a friend of mine named Donnie Hall, and he fought Ali,&quot; Ellis said. &quot;Donnie lost, and I thought I could maybe be a fighter then.&quot; Ellis went with Hall to Louisville&#x27;s Columbia Gym, where the coach was a police officer named Joe Martin.

Ellis won 59 of 66 amateur bouts and was a Golden Gloves champion. He boxed Ali twice as an amateur, with Ali winning the first bout and Ellis winning the second.

==Professional career==
Ellis turned professional as a middleweight in 1961. Early in his pro career, he was trained and managed by Bud Bruner. With Bruner, he compiled a record of 15–5 (6 KOs). His five losses were decisions to top Middleweight contenders Holly Mims (whom he defeated in a rematch), Henry Hank, Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, Don Fullmer, and George Benton. This start probably helped his speed of punch, movement and finesse.

At the end of 1964, after losing three out of four fights, Ellis decided to leave Bruner. He later recalled Bruner fondly. &quot;I liked him, and I fought a lot of top-rated fighters when I was with him, but eventually I had to move on,&quot; Ellis said. &quot;He did me justice, and we always remained friends.&quot;

Ellis wrote a letter to an at first skeptical Angelo Dundee, the trainer of Ali, and asked him to handle his career. Dundee agreed to be both manager and trainer. Ellis became a sparring partner for Ali and fought on several of Ali&#x27;s early pre-world championship undercards. Six of his first eight fights with Dundee were on an Ali undercards.

By the mid-1960s, Ellis was fighting heavyweights. Being a tall natural athletic build he&#x27;d had increasing trouble keeping down to middleweight. Dr. Ferdie Pacheco, who worked with both Ali and Ellis throughout their careers, called Ellis&#x27;s development from middleweight to heavyweight one of the most dramatic he could recall.

===WBA heavyweight title eliminator matches===
By 1966, Ellis was fighting as a heavyweight. When Ali was stripped of the world title for refusing to enter the military, the World Boxing Association staged an eight-man tournament that featured most of the top heavyweight contenders. Ellis, who was ranked eighth in the world after eight consecutive wins, was invited to be in the tournament. Joe Frazier, ranked second by the WBA, chose not to participate in the tournament. Instead, Frazier fought for the vacant New York State Athletic Commission World Heavyweight Championship, which he won with an eleventh-round knockout of Buster Mathis.

In the opening round of the tournament, Ellis fought Leotis Martin on August 5, 1967, in Houston, Texas. Ellis, the betting underdog, battered Martin&#x27;s face into a bloody mask, and the referee stopped the fight in the ninth round.

Ellis met Oscar Bonavena in the second round of the tournament. The fight took place on December 2, 1967, in Louisville, Kentucky. Ellis, once again the underdog, dropped Bonavena with a right once in the third round and once in the tenth. After twelve rounds, Ellis was awarded a unanimous decision. This fight was regarded as one of the best of his career. He seemed to be in control for most of the fight apart from the ninth round. Ellis advanced to the tournament final.

===WBA heavyweight champion===
In the tournament final, Ellis faced Jerry Quarry, a slight betting favorite, on April 27, 1968, in Oakland, California. Ellis fought what &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; called &quot;a tactical masterpiece&quot;. A cautious Ellis won a 15-round split decision to capture the vacant WBA Heavyweight Championship. Quarry said, &quot;If they&#x27;d given me the decision, I&#x27;d have given it back. I didn&#x27;t deserve it.&quot;

===Title reign===
In his only successful title defense, Ellis defeated Floyd Patterson by a controversial 15-round decision on September 14, 1968, in Stockholm, Sweden. Ellis, who suffered a broken nose in the second round, was awarded the decision by the referee, the sole judge. Many in the crowd of 30,000 disagreed with the decision and started chanting, &quot;Floyd champ!&quot; The &quot;New York Times&quot; scored the fight seven rounds to six for Ellis, with two even.

Following the defeat of Patterson, Ellis was out of the ring for seventeen months. He was going to fight Henry Cooper in the United Kingdom, even though the British Boxing Board of Control refused to recognize the fight as a world title bout: the BBBofC was affiliated with the World Boxing Council, who stated that they would only recognize a fight between Joe Frazier and a suitable contender as being for the world title. The fight was postponed a couple of times and eventually cancelled because Cooper injured his knee. Ellis then planned to fight Bob Cleroux in Montreal, but Cleroux lost what was supposed to be a tune-up fight against the lightly regarded Billy Joiner. Finally, Ellis was going to fight Gregorio Peralta in Argentina, but promoters canceled the fight 24 hours before it was to take place because of poor ticket sales.

===Unification title match with Joe Frazier===

On February 16, 1970, Ellis fought Joe Frazier to unify the World Heavyweight Championship at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The undefeated Frazier, a heavy betting favorite, proved to be too strong and powerful. Ellis, who had never been floored as a heavyweight, was knocked down twice in the fourth round by a relentless Frazier. At the request of Ellis&#x27;: trainer Angelo Dundee, the referee stopped the fight before the start of the fifth round. It was the first knockout loss for Ellis.

===Ellis vs. Ali===
After winning his next three fights, Ellis fought Muhammad Ali in the Houston Astrodome on July 26, 1971. Angelo Dundee chose to work with Ellis for the fight. He was Ali&#x27;s trainer, but he was both manager and trainer for Ellis. Working with Ellis meant that he would get a bigger share of the purse. Ali accepted the arrangement and got Harry Wiley, who had worked with Henry Armstrong and Sugar Ray Robinson, to be his trainer for the Ellis fight.

Ellis fought well over the first three rounds, but the fight turned after Ellis was hurt by a right hand in the fourth round. The right hand &quot;hurt me so bad I couldn&#x27;t really fight my best after that&quot;, Ellis said. &quot;It ruined me.&quot; The referee stopped the fight in the twelfth round as Ali pummelled Ellis.

===Diminishing skills===

After the loss to Ali, Ellis won his next eight fights by knockout. But on June 18, 1973, he fought Earnie Shavers, who was 44–2 (43 KOs), at Madison Square Garden. Ellis, ranked fourth by the WBA, stunned Shavers in the first round with a chopping right to the jaw and backed him into a corner. Shavers took numerous shots in the corner before clinching. After the referee separated the fighters, Shavers put Ellis down for the count with a powerful single right uppercut to the chin. The time was 2:39.

Ellis came back with a knockout win against club fighter Memphis Al Jones, but with his skills in decline, he went winless in his next five fights. He lost a split decision to Boone Kirkman, fought a draw with Larry Middleton, dropped decisions to Ron Lyle and Joe Bugner, and was stopped in nine rounds in a rematch with Joe Frazier.

The rematch with Frazier took place in Melbourne, Australia, on March 2, 1975. Ellis trained at the Golden Bowl Gym in Camberwell, Melbourne, with martial arts 4th Dan Gerry Scaife. Ellis won the first three rounds, but Frazier then picked up the intensity and took control. With Ellis bloody and battered, Angelo Dundee signaled for referee Bob Foster to stop the fight in the ninth round.

===Retirement===
On May 6, 1975, in what would be his last fight, Ellis knocked out club fighter Carl Baker in the first round. He retired aged 35 after a training injury left him partially blind in his left eye. Ellis finished his respectable career with a record of 40 wins of which 24 of them came by way of knockout, twelve losses and one draw.

==Later life==
After retiring from boxing, Ellis trained boxers. Later he worked for the Louisville Parks Department on athletic and recreational projects between 1989 and 2003. In 2004, Ellis told the &quot;Washington Times&quot; &quot;...All I ever wanted to be was a good fighter and good man.&#x27; Brother Jeff gave a tribute on his death saying &quot; He was someone you could model yourself on&quot; Ellis was a reserved family man who shunned flash although had a determined competitive streak in boxing.

With wife Mary he had six children: two sons and four daughters. His brother Charles boxed in the 1964 Olympics.
Ellis was personally kind and gracious. He maintained a brotherly relationship with Ali over all the decades. Ali himself often recalled Ellis as a great friend. Ellis wasn&#x27;t always pleased by the sparring partner tag but felt he had proved himself above that.

He lived with dementia pugilistica, for over a decade before his death. It was reported that Ellis&#x27;s condition was so bad that he believed his deceased wife, Mary, who died in 2006, was still alive.

==Death==
Ellis died in Louisville Baptist Hospital, Kentucky at the age of 74 from complications of dementia on May 6, 2014, 39 years exactly after his last boxing match. His funeral was held on 12 May, 2014, at Louisville&#x27;s Canaan Christian Church and he was buried in Green Meadows Memorial Cemetery. On the announcement Ellis&#x27;s death Muhammad Ali issued the following statement: &quot;In the world of heavyweights I always thought of him as one of the best&quot;.

==Personal life==
His son Jeff played professional football and confirmed the family were always immensely proud of Ellis&#x27;s achievements and his World Title. Ellis&#x27;s family considered that boxing exacerbated the dementia of his later years, but had not necessarily caused it. His younger brother Jerry, who had trained with Ellis, commented that he avoided watching boxing in his later years as he had seen too many people damaged by it.

<doc id="1249041" wikidata="Q2053337" url="?curid=1249041" title="Bernie Kosar">
<text>Bernard Joseph Kosar Jr. (born November 25, 1963) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, leading the team to a national championship in 1983. He subsequently played in the NFL for the Cleveland Browns from 1985 to 1993, the Dallas Cowboys in 1993, and Miami Dolphins from 1994 to 1996. He was the backup quarterback on the 1993 Cowboys team that won Super Bowl XXVIII.

==Early life==
Kosar was born in Youngstown, Ohio and raised in suburban Boardman Township. He is of Hungarian descent.

He attended Boardman High School, where he earned &quot;Parade&quot; magazine All-American honors in 1981 as a senior and was Ohio&#x27;s Division I &quot;Player of the Year.&quot; He also gained recognition as a baseball player, especially for his pitching skills.

==College career==

Kosar was recruited by University of Miami head football coach Howard Schnellenberger, and Kosar committed to the University of Miami, which ran a passing-oriented offense and was beginning to emerge as one of the nation&#x27;s premier college football programs. Kosar proved instrumental in establishing the University of Miami nickname &quot;Quarterback U&quot; in reference to the number of top quarterbacks the program produced.

After being redshirted in 1982, Kosar started all 12 games as a freshman in 1983. In the 1983 season, he completed 61.5 percent of his passes for 2,328 yards and 15 touchdowns, leading the Hurricanes to an 11–1 regular season and a berth in the Orange Bowl against top-ranked Nebraska, which had won 22 consecutive games. In the game, Kosar passed for 300 yards and two touchdowns, and the Hurricanes topped the Cornhuskers, 31–30, for Miami&#x27;s first national championship. Kosar earned Orange Bowl MVP honors for his performance.

In 1984, he set Hurricane season records with 3,642 yards and 25 touchdowns, was a second-team All-American and finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. Kosar&#x27;s career completion percentage of 62.3 percent is still a Hurricanes record.

Kosar threw for 447 yards and two touchdowns, completing 25 of 38 attempts, in the Hurricanes&#x27; November 23, 1984 47–45 loss to Boston College when Flutie threw his famous &quot;Hail Flutie&quot; pass. Earlier the same year, Kosar watched as replacement quarterback Frank Reich of the Maryland Terrapins launched what was then the biggest comeback in college football history, coming back from a first-half deficit of 31–0 to win a 42–40 victory. The game and pass have been described as among the most memorable moments in sports history.

His final collegiate game was the 1985 Fiesta Bowl against UCLA, which the Hurricanes lost 39–37. In that game, Kosar completed 31 of 44 passes for 294 yards, two touchdown passes and one interception.

Kosar graduated from the University of Miami School of Business with a double major in finance and economics. He took 18 credit hours during the spring of 1985 and an additional six during the summer to graduate early.

Kosar was interviewed about his time at the University of Miami for the documentary &quot;The U&quot;, which premiered on ESPN on December 12, 2009.

==Professional career==
===NFL draft controversy===
In 1985, Kosar was a highly sought NFL prospect, described as having &quot;an elite football IQ&quot; and &quot;being able to decipher a defense quicker than his coaches.&quot; But his route from the University of Miami to the National Football League would prove to be filled with widespread controversy and the use of highly unconventional transactional and draft NFL tactics.

In a March 14, 1985 press conference in Miami, Kosar announced that he was forgoing his final two years of collegiate eligibility at the University of Miami to enter the National Football League. Kosar grew up a Cleveland Browns fan, and also announced in the press conference that he would like to play for the Browns in his native Ohio.

NFL rules at the time permitted only college seniors and college graduates to enter the 1985 NFL draft, and Kosar was still a University of Miami underclassman in March 1985. To establish eligibility, Kosar announced he had arranged an expedited academic plan with 18 credits in spring 1985 and an additional six credits in the summer that would permit him to graduate from the University of Miami in time to meet the draft&#x27;s eligibility requirements. In June 1985, the University of Miami notified the NFL that Kosar had met the course requirements to graduate.

Seeking to obtain Kosar in the NFL draft, the Minnesota Vikings on April 9, 1985, traded with the Houston Oilers to obtain a top draft selection and announced their intent to draft Kosar. Meanwhile, also seeking to draft Kosar, the Browns quietly traded their first round NFL draft selections for 1985 and 1986, their third round selection in 1985 and sixth selection in 1986 with the Buffalo Bills for the Bills&#x27; first pick in the 1985 supplemental draft, which paved the way for the Browns to select Kosar in the 1985 supplemental draft if Kosar entered it.

The NFL deadline for the submission of formal eligibility documents for the 1985 draft was April 15, 1985, and the Vikings learned that Kosar had not met the deadline. &quot;I&#x27;m as confused as you are,&quot; Vikings coach Bud Grant said at the time about Kosar. &quot;We put our bid on the line. It&#x27;s up to the commissioner whether you need a verbal or a written commitment from the man. He dropped out of football, hired an agent and declared he was going in the draft. The only thing he didn&#x27;t do was sign a letter.&quot;

Teams soon learned of the Browns&#x27; highly unorthodox trade with the Bills to obtain Kosar in the supplemental draft. Several teams asked then NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to prevent the unusual trade between the Browns and Bills. Rozelle, in turn, announced that he was giving Kosar until April 23 to submit eligibility documents for either the traditional or supplemental draft. On April 25, Kosar held a press conference, announcing his intention to skip the traditional draft and enter the supplemental draft, where he expected to be selected with the Browns&#x27; first selection.

The Houston Oilers, also seeking to draft Kosar in the traditional draft, threatened to sue to stop the entire draft unless Kosar was in it. Houston also appealed to the Vikings to join the suit. Kosar&#x27;s agent, in turn, threatened to sue the NFL if Kosar was obligated to enter the traditional draft.

But when the Vikings refused to join the suit, the Oilers dropped it. Kosar submitted documentation announcing his eligibility and participation in the 1985 supplemental draft.

On July 3, 1985, the Browns used their first selection in the 1985 supplemental draft to select Kosar, offering him a five-year contract.

===Cleveland Browns===
The Cleveland Browns intended for Kosar to serve as Gary Danielson&#x27;s backup in Kosar&#x27;s rookie season, but Danielson injured his shoulder in the fifth week. Kosar completed half of his passes in the team&#x27;s run-oriented offense that year, and the team squeaked into the playoffs with an 8–8 record, losing to the Miami Dolphins in the divisional playoffs.

Danielson was injured again in the 1986 preseason. By the time Danielson healed and returned, however, Kosar had established himself as the Browns&#x27; permanent starter. In a new, passing-focused offense, Kosar threw for 3,854 yards and finished second in the league with 310 completions. The Browns took the top seed in the American Football Conference (AFC) with a 12–4 record. In the divisional playoffs against the New York Jets, Kosar threw for a then-playoff-record 489 yards (a record since broken by Tom Brady in Super Bowl LII) in leading the Browns to a 23–20 comeback victory in double overtime. But the following week, John Elway&#x27;s 98-yard drive in the AFC championship game kept the Browns out of the Super Bowl.

Kosar&#x27;s most productive year statistically was 1987. In the strike-shortened season, he completed 62 percent of his passes for 3,033 yards and 22 touchdowns and led the AFC in quarterback rating. In an AFC championship rematch against Elway&#x27;s Denver Broncos, Kosar threw for 356 yards and three touchdowns in a 38–33 loss.

Kosar spent most of the 1988 season sidelined with injuries but came back to throw for 3,533 yards in 1989. That year, the Browns advanced to the AFC championship for the third time in four years, losing again to the Broncos in Denver.

Kosar set a record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (3 games) having thrown three scores against both Indianapolis and Denver in 1987, and three against Buffalo in 1989.

Kosar&#x27;s later years in Cleveland were dampened by injuries and dwindling support around him. In 1990, Kosar threw a career-high 15 interceptions as the Browns went 3–13. He also started the 1990 season by setting an NFL record for consecutive pass attempts without an interception with 286. The following year, 1991, Kosar came back to throw for 3,487 yards and 18 touchdowns to only 9 interceptions. In 1990 and 1991, Kosar set league records by throwing 308 consecutive passes without an interception, which stood as an AFC League record for almost two decades.

In 1991, the Browns hired Bill Belichick as head coach. Following a 1992 season that saw Kosar miss nine games with a broken ankle and go 2–5 in the games that he started, Belichick signed quarterback Vinny Testaverde, also a former University of Miami quarterback, prior to the 1993 season. After falling from 3–0 to 3–2 in the 1993 season, Belichick benched Kosar in favor of Testaverde. An injury to Testaverde returned Kosar to the field. After a 29–14 loss to Denver in Week 10, the Browns released Kosar.

According to a poll of Browns fans in 2019, Kosar was considered the &quot;most beloved&quot; Browns player in the franchise&#x27;s history.

===Dallas Cowboys===
The Dallas Cowboys suffered an injury to starter Troy Aikman on the same weekend. After Kosar&#x27;s release, the Cowboys promptly signed Kosar to a one-year, $1 million contract as the backup quarterback for rookie Jason Garrett. After an inefficient first nine minutes of the game against Phoenix with only two completions, Garrett was replaced by Kosar, who finished the rest of the game and started the next game for his only two meaningful game action in the regular season. During the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers, Aikman was knocked out of the game with a concussion in the third quarter, with Kosar finishing the game, completing five of nine pass attempts for 83 yards and one touchdown. He earned his only Super Bowl championship as a backup in Super Bowl XXVIII, entering the game in the final play and knelt down to close the victory.

===Miami Dolphins===
Kosar spent the final two years of his NFL career with the Miami Dolphins as backup to Dan Marino. Kosar brought to the Dolphins a trick play that helped the Dolphins top the New York Jets in a crucial 1994 game. With the clock winding down and the Dolphins trailing by three, Marino pretended to spike the ball to stop the clock. He then threw the winning touchdown pass to Mark Ingram.

Kosar finished his 12-season career with 1,994 completions in 3,365 attempts for 23,301 yards and 124 touchdowns, 87 interceptions, and five rushing touchdowns. In November 1991, Kosar also set the NFL record for most consecutive completed passes without an interception, a record that stood until broken by Tom Brady on December 26, 2010.

===Sports-related===
Since his NFL retirement in 1996, Kosar has been involved in several sports and business-related ventures. He hosted the Nestlé/Bernie Kosar Charity Classic at Tanglewood National Golf Club in Bainbridge Township, Ohio throughout the 1990s.

In 2001, Kosar purchased the Florida Panthers, a National Hockey League team, along with pharmaceutical businessman Alan Cohen.

In 2007, there was some speculation that Kosar might take the head coaching job at the University of Miami, his alma mater and where he holds a seat on the university&#x27;s board of regents. Kosar acknowledged that he had considered taking the job before it was ultimately offered to Randy Shannon.

Kosar also purchased a minority share in the Arena Football League&#x27;s Las Vegas Gladiators in 2007 and announced that the team would move to Cleveland and play under the name Cleveland Gladiators. On October 16, 2007, Kosar was named team president and CEO of the franchise. The Gladiators finished the 2008 regular season 9–7, earning them a playoff berth.

On October 17, 2009, Kosar was hired as a consultant for the Cleveland Browns.

In September 2022, Kosar launched &quot;The Bernie Kosar Show&quot; with local sports media company BIGPLAY. A sports podcast with Cleveland Browns cornerback Hanford Dixon interviewing athletes and discussing the Cleveland Browns past present, and future. In 2023 Kosar was involved in a lawsuit related to BIGPLAY.

===Business and property ventures===
Following the 2008–2009 recession, Kosar and his businesses declared bankruptcy on June 19, 2009, later revealing $9.2 million in assets and $18.9 million in debt. Kosar&#x27;s initial bankruptcy filing was a Chapter 11 restructuring, but the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Ft. Lauderdale on January 6, 2010, ordered the proceeding be changed to a Chapter 7 liquidation. Under the restructuring, Kosar&#x27;s filings proposed protecting his NFL pension, though it was unclear if this will be permitted under a Chapter 7 proceeding.

In July 2010, it was reported that Kosar was on the verge of losing property in Geauga County, Ohio for unpaid back taxes totaling $173,557.90. In September 2010, the trustees of Auburn Township indicated it was considering purchasing the land in foreclosure.

Kosar has lent his name to Kosar&#x27;s Wood-Fired Grill at the Hard Rock Rock Casino Northfield Park in Northfield, Ohio, which opened in December 2013.

Kosar has teamed with Ohio grocery chain Heinen&#x27;s for a motivational and wellness seminar series based on Kosar&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Learning to Scramble&quot;, which he published in 2017.

In October 2023, Kosar announced a line of wellness products named U Matter Wellness Essentials under his Kosar Wellness brand, selling supplements including digestive enzymes, fermented vegetable powder and effervescent humic fulvic acid tablets. As part of the product launch, Kosar partnered with Foundation Health Solutions, an Ohio-based long-term care company. In 2023 Kosar was involved in a lawsuit related to Kosar Wellness.

A Jan. 5, 2024, Cleveland.com story by Peter Chakerian stated that Bernie Kosar just launched a new patented coffee blend, designed by Kosar himself to &quot;boost immunity, protect against chronic diseases and strengthen heart health.&quot;

==Personal life==
On June 22, 1990, Kosar married Babette Ferre whom he first met as a University of Miami student. They had four children. Ferre filed for divorce in 2005, alleging that Kosar had engaged in reckless spending, bad investments, and drug use. The divorce was finalized in 2007. Kosar dated Tami Longaberger of The Longaberger Company from 2009 to 2013.

Kosar was prominently featured in &quot;Broke&quot;, a 2012 ESPN &quot;30 For 30&quot; documentary about the financial problems common among high-earning athletes. According to one review of &quot;Broke&quot;, &quot;[Kosar&#x27;s] story proved to be the true heart of the film&quot; with Kosar&#x27;s upfront discussion of family problems and bad business decisions.

On September 29, 2013, Kosar was pulled over by law enforcement in Solon, Ohio for speeding and was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. He later pleaded no contest to a lesser charge of reckless operation and received a $750 fine and suspended jail sentence.

Kosar&#x27;s political views are undetermined, but was invited to the 2016 Republican National Convention, and spoke positively of host state Ohio and host city Cleveland in the context of the Convention being held there. In 2022, he appeared in an advertisement for Tim Ryan, the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate in Ohio.

===Health===
Kosar continues to deal with lingering health issues related to several concussions he sustained during his playing career and enrolled in a treatment program to alleviate his symptoms. Kosar says the experimental treatment has been helpful and has promoted it to other players who may have developed symptoms related to chronic traumatic encephalopathy. For over a decade, Kosar&#x27;s symptoms have included insomnia, slurred speech, and ringing in his head.

In 2024, Kosar said he was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and early symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==In popular culture==
In the 2010 novel &quot;I Am Number Four&quot; by Pittacus Lore, protagonist John Smith finds an abandoned beagle named &quot;Bernie Kosar&quot; who becomes Smith&#x27;s pet. In the 2011 film adaptation, a poster of Kosar is shown in Smith&#x27;s new bedroom.

<text>The Junglinster Longwave Transmitter is a longwave broadcasting facility used by RTL near Junglinster, Luxembourg, which went into service in 1932. Its aerial consists of three free-standing steel-framework towers, which are ground fed radiators. These towers formed a directional aerial for the frequency 234 kHz and until 1980 were 250 metres high. Since 1980 their height has been 215 metres.

Junglinster longwave transmitter was at time of inauguration one of the most powerful transmitters in the world. It was discovered that its signal can under some conditions show cross modulation with other radio stations by ionospheric reflection. This phenomenon was named &quot;Luxembourg effect&quot; after the circumstance that it was first detected at the signal of this transmitter in Luxembourg.

Since the inauguration of the Beidweiler longwave transmitter the Junglinster longwave transmitter has been only a spare.

Also at the site of Junglinster Longwave Transmitter are the shortwave transmitters of RTL, at the frequencies 6090 kHz and 15350 kHz were used. Transmitting on 6090 kHz, it is of special interest as it was (until the 80s) one of the best known radio stations in Germany and several radio sets had a special switch for its reception, the so-called &quot;Luxembourg&quot;-switch.
Today this transmitter works in DRM mode.

From 1951 on the site of Junglinster Longwave transmitter was also the mediumwave transmitter. It moved to Marnach in 1955.

<doc id="1249052" wikidata="Q4857708" url="?curid=1249052" title="Baptist successionism">
<text>Baptist successionism (or Baptist perpetuity) is one of several theories on the origin and continuation of Baptist churches. The theory postulates an unbroken lineage of churches (since the days of John the Baptist or the Book of Acts) which have held beliefs similar to those of current Baptists. Groups often included in this lineage include the Montanists, Paulicians, Paterines, Cathari, Waldenses, Albigenses, and Anabaptists. Although there exists variation within successionist theories, particularly in the inclusion of Messalianism, alongside some Lollard and Hussite factions. 

This view is held by some conservative Baptists and it has been associated with Baptist writers such as John Spittlehouse (1652), Jesse Mercer (1769–1841), Charles Spurgeon (1834 – 1892), and James Milton Carroll (1852 – 1931) among some others. However, modern scholarship sees the theory as pseudohistorical, viewing English Baptists as originating from English Puritanism. Although a minority still hold to the Anabaptist influence theory of Baptist origins, which although accepts the connection between Anabaptism and Baptists, does not hold to the rest of Baptist successionism.

The majority of modern Baptists do not believe in successionism today.

== Theory ==

The theory proposes that Baptists have an unbroken lineage from the early church, while claiming that over time bishops or pastors started to assume more authority which led to the Catholic church being born and which led to errors.

Groups often included in the succession line are Montanists, Novationists, Donatists, Paulicians, Pataria, Cathars, Waldenses, Petrobrusians, Arnoldists, Henricians, and Anabaptists. With some variantions of the including Messalianism and factions of Hussitism and Lollardism within the claimed succession. 

Supporters of the theory argue that groups such as Bogomils, Paulicians, or Cathars were Baptist in doctrine instead of Gnostic; with, for example, Berlin Hisel arguing that many charges put towards Bogomils were false, although Baptist successionists may still grant that not everybody inside these sects held to the same views as modern Baptists. 

However Baptist historians such as Thomas Armitage have held to a model of Baptist history which did not advocate for visible institutional succession of Baptist churches, while still arguing for the existence of Baptist principles throughout history. Despite rejecting their affiliations with Gnosticism, he still denied the inclusion of groups such as the Cathars, Paulicians and Bogomils as proto-Baptists, instead arguing that they were closer to modern Quakerism. However, he still held that groups such as the Petrobrusians, Henricans, Waldensians held to Baptist principles in their views, alongside praising early Christian theologians such as Jovinian, Helvidius, Aerius of Sebaste and Vigilantius. Thomas Armitage also drew parallers between Montanism and Baptists, such as by the principles of regenerate church membership, although still stating that there are significant differences. 

=== Montanism ===
Montanism is the first and earliest group included in Baptist successionism. Montanism has been generally associated as being a charismatic group that emphasized personal revelation, which also sought to establish a more conservative personal ethic. However, Berlin Hisel, a proponent of Baptist successionism argued that Eusebius&#x27; (265 – 339) portrayal of Montanism is questionable, claiming that he had no firsthand sources on Montanism. Although conceding that some of the Montanists may have held aberrant views, he still held that Montanism was largely an early Baptist movement. Citing the Baptist historian, Henry C. Vedder (who himself was critical of successionism), Baptist successionists have argued that due to the principle of the regenerate church taught by Montanism necessitates that they would have taught believer&#x27;s baptism.

=== Novatians ===
The Novatians were an early Christian sect that emerged in the third century. The Novatians were among the first groups included by James Milton Carroll in his &quot;Trail of Blood&quot;, whom he argued to represent an ancient form of Baptist theology. Berlin Hisel, argued that the Novatians practiced believer&#x27;s baptism and emphasized church discipline similarly to modern Baptist groups. However, the evidence for the Novatians being credobaptists has been called &quot;weak&quot; by some historians, as Augustine’s accounts and other sources do not explicitly support this view in a robust manner.

=== Donatism ===

Baptist successionists often include Donatism as a part of Baptist successionism, arguing that Donatists taught the doctrines of saved church membership, believer&#x27;s baptism and separation of church and state. The Baptist successionist Hisel Berlin, argued that Donatist statements concerning the practice of rebaptism should be viewed evidence of them practicing credobaptism.

The Baptist historian David Benedict in 1875 wrote a book called &quot;History of the Donatists&quot;, where he argued that the Donatists were congregational in their church government and rejected infant baptism. However, Dr. Heman Lincoln although rejecting the claim of David Benedict that the Donatists were fully Baptist, still argued that they held many similar principles to the Baptists such as freedom of conscience, freedom of religion and regenerate church membership. The Baptist successionist John T Christian believed that although some of the Donatists placed too much stress on the efficiency of baptism and even accepting the episcopal polity, that they were still reflective of Baptists. 

However these conclusions have been criticized, instead understanding the statements of rebaptism to refer to the claim that only Donatists could offer regeneration in Baptism, thus rebaptizing converts from non-Donatist groups so that they would be saved from hell.

=== Paulicians and Bogomils ===
Paulicianism was a sect in the Eastern Church which was started by a preacher named Constantine. As with Montanism, Baptist successionists dispute charges made against the Paulicians and Bogomils, including claims that they rejected the writings of Peter the Apostle and the Old Testament. Hisel Berlin argued that the Paulicians upheld an orthodox view of the Trinity and contended that many of the charges against them were unreliable, as the primary sources were written by their opponents. Hisel also suggested that the Paulicians practiced believer&#x27;s baptism, a belief he claimed for them to share with the Bogomils. The Baptist historian Thomas Armitage argued that the witness of Photius on the Paulicians was inaccurate, and that there were many classes of Paulicians, whom Photius and Siculus lumped wrongly together and misinterpreted their views, however he denied them as Baptists due to their denial of water baptism. However, Hisel claimed that the charges of rejecting baptism were likely false accusations, which he saw as referring to a rejection of infant baptism and trine-immersion, which he argues could have been taken as rejection of baptism itself by the opponents of Bogomilism.

=== Arnoldists ===
Hisel made the case that the Arnoldists were baptist in doctrine, as evidence the Lateran council is quoted where Arnold of Brescia was condemned for rejecting infant baptism and for the rejection of transubstantiation. A direct connection with Arnoldists and Waldensians was also claimed to support succession, a direct link was also argued with Arnoldists and Petro-Brussians.

=== Waldensians ===
The Waldensians, a medieval Christian movement of the 12th century, were identified by Hisel as having connections to the Albigenses. He claimed that the two groups shared a common origin with similar doctrinal beliefs, including the rejection of paedobaptism and a focus on personal faith. This connection was presented as part of the broader argument for Baptist succession, linking the Waldensians to other medieval groups like the Cathars.

=== Cathars ===
The Cathars or Albigenses, a medieval group generally argued to be dualistic, were often accused of rejecting marriage and other traditional sacraments within medieval sources. However, Hisel argued that the Cathars’ supposed rejection of marriage likely referred to their refusal to recognize marriage as a sacrament, rather than a denial of the institution itself. He also suggested that the Cathars rejected infant baptism and the concept of baptismal regeneration, aligning them with other groups seen as part of the Baptist succession.

Claiming the Cathars as pockets of true teaching in the middle ages has also been done by some Reformed writers, such as Jean Duvernoy and John Foxe. Magisterial Protestants and Baptists successionists who have attempted to claim Cathars as their precursors have historically denied any charges of dualism on the Cathars as simply hostile claims. The Cathar views on dualism are against Roman Catholic, Baptist and Reformed teachings. Protestant historians such as Jacques Basnage, Mosheim and Shroeck have insisted that the charges of dualism and docetism were not authentic, only hostile claims, with such arguments being criticized by Charles Schmidt.

Arguments against Catharic dualism were the following: there were possibly other neo-Manichean dualists in the Middle Ages, but they were not Cathars; that it was a misinterpration of their theology because they denied religious hierarchy set by man or that the accusation of their dualism was merely a hostile false claim. However each argument has been called &quot;unconvincing&quot; by critics.

=== Lollards ===
Although Lollardy was not included in the &quot;Trail of Blood&quot;, Charles Spurgeon (an advocate of successionism) claimed that John Wycliffe and some of the Lollard movement was opposed to the practice infant baptism.

=== Anabaptists ===

In the Trail of Blood, James Milton Carroll argued that Baptists descent from the Anabaptist movement of the 16th century. In the &quot;Baptist History Notebook&quot;, Hisel drew on historical accounts, including those of the Lutheran historian Johann Lorenz von Mosheim (1693 – 1755), to argue for a succession of Baptist-like groups throughout history. Mosheim wrote: “&quot;The true origin of that sect which acquired the denomination of Anabaptists by their administering anew the rite of baptism to those who came over to their communion, and derived that of Mennonites from the famous man to whom they owe the greatest part of their present felicity, is hidden in the depths of antiquity, and is, of consequence, extremely difficult to be ascertained&quot;.” Hisel interpreted this statement as giving credit to the idea that the Anabaptists were connected to earlier similar groups, such as the Waldensians, forming a continuous tradition of believer’s baptism and opposition to paedobaptism.

The view that the Baptist movement is an outgrowth of the Anabaptist movement is a central claim of the Baptist successionist advocates only held by some conservative Baptists. However, some other historians who do not believe in Baptist successionism, although holding a minority view, believe that early 17th century Baptists were influenced by (but not directly connected to) continental Anabaptists. According to this view, the General Baptists shared similarities with Dutch Waterlander Mennonites (one of many Anabaptist groups) including believer&#x27;s baptism only, religious liberty, separation of church and state, and Arminian views of predestination and original sin. It is certain that the early Baptist church led by Smyth had contacts with the Anabaptists; however it is debated if these influences found their way into the English General Baptists.

Representatives of this theory include A.C. Underwood and William R. Estep. Gourley writes that among some contemporary Baptist scholars who emphasize the faith of the community over soul liberty, the Anabaptist influence theory is making a comeback. This view was also taught by the Reformed historian Philip Schaff. However, the relations between Baptists and Anabaptists were early strained. In 1624, the five existing Baptist churches of London issued a condemnation of the Anabaptists. Furthermore, the original group associated with Smyth (popularly believed to be the first Baptists) broke with the Waterlander Mennonite Anabaptists after a brief period of association in the Netherlands.

C. H. Spurgeon argued that there existed an Anabaptist community in England during the 16th century, which was the origin of the English Baptist movement.

== History ==

Baptist successionsim was advocated as early as 1652 by an English Baptist named John Spittlehouse in a book entitled &quot;A Vindication of the Continued Succession of the Primitive Church of Jesus Christ (Now Scandalously Termed Anabaptists) from the Apostles Unto This Present Time&quot;. Among other early Baptists to defend successionism was the famous English preacher C. H. Spurgeon (1834 – 1892). However, the perpetuity view is most often identified with &quot;The Trail of Blood&quot;, a pamphlet by James Milton Carroll published in 1931. Other Baptist writers who held the perpetuity view are John T. Christian, Thomas Crosby, G. H. Orchard, J. M. Cramp, William Cathcart, Adam Taylor, D. B. Ray as well as Jesse Mercer, the namesake of Mercer University. 
This view was once commonly held among Baptists. Since the end of the 19th century, however, the theory has increasingly come under attack and today has been largely discredited. Nonetheless, the view continued to be the prevailing view among Baptists of the Southern United States into the latter 20th century. It is now identified primarily with Landmarkism, which is upheld by the Independent Fundamental Baptist movement, though not exclusively so. The concept attempts to parallel the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican doctrine of apostolic succession and stands in contrast to the restorationist views of Latter Day Saints and the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement.

Even within the Independent Baptists, some individuals such as Jack Hyles (1926 – 2001) did not teach Landmarkism/Baptist successionism, although he did teach that the church started in AD 31 when Christ was still alive (and not at Pentecost), and that the Catholic Church was started by the Emperor Constantine in AD 313.

== Contemporary view ==

Since the end of the 19th century the trend in academic Baptist historiography has been away from the successionist viewpoint to the view that modern day Baptists are an outgrowth of 17th-century English Separatism. This shift precipitated a controversy among Southern Baptists which occasioned the forced resignation of William H. Whitsitt, a professor at Southern Baptist Seminary, in 1898 from the seminary for advocating the new view, though his views continued to be taught in the seminary after his departure.

== Critique ==
Fr. Dwight Longenecker writing for Catholic Answers has argued that Baptist successionism is unprovable, being primarily based on theological assertion rather than historical evidence. He states that its advocates too often ignore the heretical views espoused by the groups included in the succession, using only persecution by medieval Catholicism as a polemic.

Baptist successionism has also been critiqued by some Baptists, one example being Fred Anderson (an executive director at the Virginia Baptist Historical Society), who saw Baptist successionism as &quot;fanciful history without factual basis&quot;. Today, the majority of Baptists reject the successionism of churches as in the Trail of Blood.

<text>The International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) is a steel framework container that is designed and been adopted by the International Space Station (ISS) program to support efficient integration and interchangeability of space payload hardware, such as machines and experiments. A typical rack contains 37 ISPR slots for science payloads, which are interchangeable to accommodate different components or payloads.

==Capabilities==
Each ISPR provides of internal volume being about high, wide, and deep. The rack weighs 104 kg (230 lb) and can accommodate an additional of payload equipment. The rack has internal mounting provisions to allow attachment of secondary structure. The ISPRs will be outfitted with a thin center post to accommodate sub-rack-sized payloads, such as the 483 mm (19-inch rack) Spacelab Standard Interface Rack (SIR) Drawer or the Space Shuttle Middeck Locker. Utility pass-through ports are located on each side to allow cables to be run between Racks. Module attachment points are provided at the top of the rack and via pivot points at the bottom. The pivot points support installation and maintenance. Tracks on the exterior front posts allow mounting of payload equipment and laptop computers. Additional adapters on the ISPRs are provided for ground handling.

==Compatibility==
The International Standard Payload Rack are the size of a side-by-side refrigerator, and is too big to fit through the Russian probe and drogue docking system, APAS, or NDS docking systems, and therefore cannot be transferred directly from a Progress, ATV, or the interior of the Space Shuttle to the ISS. In the past ISPRs were delivered in Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules, which were carried in the Space Shuttle cargo bay and berthed to CBM ports. Cygnus spacecraft hatches are too narrow to fit ISPRs with their wide openings and Cargo Dragon 1 spacecraft have no capability to either launch or return ISPRs because of the design of the pressurized section of the Cargo Dragon 1 spacecraft which can only transport cargo bags and smaller racks. Cargo Dragon 2 spacecraft have wide hatch openings and can not fit the wide ISPRs. ISPRs can only be delivered using the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle.

==Other ISPR systems==
Japan has developed an ISPR with interfaces and capabilities nearly identical to NASA&#x27;s.

<text>Martin Austin Fido (18 October 1939 – 2 April 2019) was a university professor, true crime writer and broadcaster. His many books include &quot;The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper&quot;, &quot;The Krays: Unfinished Business&quot;, &quot;The Official Encyclopedia of Scotland Yard&quot;, &quot;Serial Killers&quot;, and &quot;The Murder Guide to London&quot;. He is also one of the authors of &quot;The Complete Jack the Ripper A to Z&quot;.

Martin Fido was born in Penzance, Cornwall, to Austin Harry and Enid Mary (Hobrough) Fido. He attended Truro School and later Lincoln College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1961. He pursued a Master’s degree on the novels of Benjamin Disraeli at Balliol College, Oxford.

On 21 June 1961, Fido married Judith Mary Spicer, and the couple had two daughters, Rebecca and Abigail. After leaving college in 1966, where he had been a junior research fellow in English, he went to the University of Leeds where he lectured in English until 1973. In 1971, he spent a year as a visiting associate professor a Michigan State University in the USA. Following his divorce from Judith in 1972, he married his second wife Norma Elaine Wilson on 16 December 1972. 

In 1973, he became a reader in English Literature and head of the English department at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus, Barbados. In the West Indies he was active in theatre and educational broadcasting, and during this time he had a son, Austin. After he separated from his wife (they would divorce in 1984), he resigned from his job to write a book about science, philosophy and 19th-century literature, but he lost seven years of work in a fire.

In 1983 he returned to England and moved into a block of flats previously occupied by the Kray twins, and became a freelance writer and broadcaster, specialising in true crime. He broadcast a weekly segment on London&#x27;s LBC Radio series &quot;Leading Britain&#x27;s Conversation&quot; called &quot;Murder After Midnight&quot; from 1987 to 2001, in which he detailed a famous true crime case in each episode. Several of these segments were produced and released commercially on cassette and CD by his friend (and fellow LBC broadcaster) Paul Savory. Edited versions of the scripts were also released in book form. Aside from his many true crime books he has also written illustrated biographies of Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, Rudyard Kipling and Oscar Wilde, and books on Agatha Christie, and Sherlock Holmes. He translated Louis Cazamian&#x27;s &quot;Le Roman Social en Angleterre&quot;, and his play &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Bajan!&quot; was performed successfully in Barbados and London. 

His most acclaimed work is &quot;The Crimes, Detection and Death of Jack the Ripper&quot; (1987). In this book, Fido identified the infamous Jack the Ripper as the Russian-Jewish butcher Aaron Kosminski. Former criminal profiler for the FBI John E. Douglas endorsed Fido’s hypothesis after conducting a thorough two-decade personal investigation into the Whitechapel murders. Over time, Fido’s theory has gained recognition as one of the most probable explanations, and gained credibility when DNA found on the blood-stained shawl belonging to Catherine Eddowes, one of Jack the Ripper&#x27;s victims, was alleged to be Kominski&#x27;s.

On 17 December 1994, he married Karen Lynn Sandel, and in 2000, with his three children all adults, Fido settled in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, to help Karen (who died on 29 October 2013) nurse her parents through their terminal illnesses. From 2001 until his death he taught writing and research at Boston University, including a course called “Sympathy For The Devil”. He was himself a practicing Quaker.

Martin Fido, who was suffering from cancer in his later years, died on 2 April 2019 of complications resulting from a fall.

<doc id="1249062" wikidata="Q715572" url="?curid=1249062" title="Troy Polamalu">
<text>Troy Aumua Polamalu (; born Troy Benjamin Aumua; April 19, 1981) is an American former professional football player who spent his entire 12-year career as a safety for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL). An eight-time Pro Bowl and six-time All-Pro selection, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020, his first year of eligibility.

Polamalu played college football for the USC Trojans, earning consensus All-American honors in 2002. He was chosen by the Steelers in the first round of the 2003 NFL draft. He was a member of two Steelers&#x27; Super Bowl championship teams and was the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2010, helping them to another Super Bowl appearance. He was also the head of player relations of the Alliance of American Football. Known for his &quot;range, explosiveness, and impact on the field,&quot; Polamalu is widely considered one of the greatest safeties in NFL history, and is credited with playing a key role in the Steelers&#x27; success during the 2000s.

==Early life==
Polamalu was born in Garden Grove, California. His mother is Suila Polamalu. Polamalu is of American Samoan descent. He is the youngest of five children. His father left the family soon after Polamalu was born. Polamalu spent his early years in Santa Ana, California. At age eight, Polamalu vacationed in Tenmile, Oregon with his aunt and uncle for three weeks; afterwards, he begged his mother to let him live in Oregon. Concerned about the negative influences in nearby Los Angeles, Polamalu&#x27;s mother sent him to Oregon to live with his uncle, aunt, and cousins when he was nine years old. Polamalu described his uncle, Salu Polamalu, as a disciplinarian who kept him straight.

Polamalu graduated from Douglas High School in Winston, Oregon. While there, he played high school football. Following his junior season, Polamalu was named to the All-State first team and was the All-Far West League Offensive Most Valuable Player for Douglas High, which achieved a 9–1 record. He rushed for 1,040 yards with 22 touchdowns and had 310 receiving yards. On defense, he made 65 tackles and had eight interceptions. Despite playing in only four games during his senior season due to injury, he was named to the 1998 Super Prep All-Northwest team, &quot;Tacoma News Tribune&quot; Western 100, and the All-Far West League second team. As a two-way player, Polamalu rushed for 671 yards with nine touchdowns and had three interceptions.

Polamalu also played high school baseball and basketball, where he received all-state and all-league honors.

==College career==
Polamalu received an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Southern California (USC), and played for the Trojans from 1999 to 2002. &quot;I believe God named me Troy for a reason&quot;, he said (Troy was the ancient capital of the Trojans). &quot;I was born to come here.&quot;

===Freshman season===
Polamalu began his college career in 1999 as a true freshman, playing backup at safety and linebacker, while also contributing on special teams. While playing in eight games, he recorded 12 tackles, two sacks, and two forced fumbles. Against Louisiana Tech, he showed his effectiveness on special teams, blocking a punt. His freshman season was cut short when he suffered a concussion at practice. The injury sidelined him for four games.

===Sophomore season===
The 2000 season marked the beginning of Polamalu&#x27;s career. He opened his season starting against Penn State, and recorded only two tackles but made an interception for a 43-yard touchdown. While playing against Colorado, he made five tackles and recovered a fumble that set up a Trojan touchdown. The next game, he again recorded five tackles and also sacked Oregon State&#x27;s quarterback. During a game against Oregon, he ended the game with 13 tackles, two tackles for a loss, and one interception. Later on, against Stanford, he made 11 tackles in the game. He set a career-high with 14 tackles against Arizona State and tied that mark against Notre Dame. This marked his first year starting all 12 games at strong safety and he closed out 2000 with 83 tackles, five tackles-for-loss, one sack, two interceptions, and one touchdown.

===Junior season===
In 2001, he had the best year of his college career. He started the season by being voted as the team captain, and in the season opener he recorded seven tackles and one tackle for a loss against San Jose State. Against Kansas State, he had a game-high 13 tackles, three tackles for a loss, and one forced fumble. Polamalu continued his dominance against Stanford, making a game-high 10 stops, one tackle for a loss, and his first blocked punt of the season. In the next game against Washington he had a game-high 13 tackles, two tackles for a loss, an interception that he returned for a 22-yard touchdown. Throughout the next four games, Polamalu continued to have the most tackles in each game. He had a streak of six games in a row and eight total in the season where he led both teams in tackles. Against Oregon State, he accumulated a game-high 11 tackles, two tackles for a loss, two pass deflections, one forced fumble, and a blocked punt that USC recovered. His streak ended against California, when he had four tackles, but made a game-deciding play with an interception that he returned for a 58-yard touchdown. The next week, the Trojans played their rival, UCLA. Polamalu had two tackles but made key plays when he blocked a punt and made an interception that set up key field goals for USC. He won his first PAC-10 Defensive Player of the Week. USC went on to the Las Vegas Bowl against Utah and Polamalu made a career-high 20 tackles, and three tackles for a loss. He finished his junior campaign with a team-high 118 tackles, 13 tackles for a loss, one sack, three interceptions, two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, three blocked punts, and two touchdowns. Polamalu won USC&#x27;s MVP award and was voted a first-team All-American by Football Writers and College and Pro Football News Weekly. The Associated Press voted him second-team All-American.

===Senior season===
For his last season, Polamalu continued to uphold his big play reputation. After being voted team captain for the second consecutive year, he opened the 2002 season with seven tackles and one tackle for a loss in a victory over Auburn. The Trojans faced #18 Colorado in the second game and Polamalu had a team-high 11 tackles. His performance in the 40–3 blowout over Colorado won him Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Week. In the fifth game of the season, he injured his ankle on the first defensive series against #17 Washington State. After sitting out a game, he returned against #22 Washington and recorded five tackles and returned an interception 33 yards. Polamalu then disrupted Stanford for the third year in a row, accumulating a season-high 13 tackles, two tackles for a loss, and one sack. He played his last college game in the Orange Bowl against #3 Iowa. A hamstring injury sidelined him for the majority of the game. Polamalu finished his senior season with 68 tackles, nine tackles for a loss, three sacks, one interception, and three forced fumbles. He was voted a first team All-American by the Associated Press, Football Writers, ESPN.com, and Walter Camp, making him the first Trojan to be a two-time first-team All-American since Tony Boselli in 1992.

Polamalu finished his college career with 278 tackles, 29 tackles for a loss, six interceptions, four blocked punts, and three touchdowns.

==Professional career==

===2003===
In the last game of his college career in the Orange Bowl, Polamalu injured his knee in pre-game warm-ups and had very limited action in the game that day. The injury also caused Polamalu to miss the Senior Bowl and 2003 NFL Combine. On March 12, 2003, Polamalu participated at USC&#x27;s pro day, along with Carson Palmer, Justin Fargas, Kareem Kelly, Sultan McCullough, Malaefou MacKenzie, and others. He performed the three-cone drill (6.75), short shuttle (4.37), and 40-yard dash (4.33) for NFL team representatives and scouts.

The Pittsburgh Steelers initially had a verbal agreement with Dexter Jackson, who was the reigning Super Bowl MVP with the 2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers. With an agreement in place with Jackson, the Steelers focused on drafting a running back in the first round. On March 12, 2003, Jackson signed with the Arizona Cardinals after they added $2 million to their offer and increased his salary by $2.3 million in the first three-years.

Polamalu was projected to be a late-first or early-second-round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked the top strong safety prospect by BLESTO and National Scouting Combines. The Steelers selected Polamalu in the first round (16th overall) in the 2003 NFL draft.

The San Diego Chargers, who had the 15th overall pick, had a major need at safety to replace Rodney Harrison but passed on the opportunity to select Polamalu by trading down and getting Sammy Davis and Terrence Kiel. The Steelers quickly made a move to bring Polamalu to their team. The Steelers believed so much that Polamalu could have a positive impact on their defense that they traded up from the 27th spot to the 16th spot, originally held by the Chiefs. The Steelers traded away the 92nd and 200th overall picks for the rights to switch first-round picks. The Kansas City Chiefs went on to draft Larry Johnson, Julian Battle, and Brooks Bollinger (the Bollinger pick was subsequently traded to the Jets in the same draft) with the picks acquired from the trade. He has the distinction of being one of only two safeties ever drafted by the Steelers in the first round of an NFL Draft; the other being Terrell Edmunds in 2018.

On July 28, 2003, the Steelers signed Polamalu after a short hold out to a five-year, $12.10 million contract.

On July 29, 2003, Polamalu arrived at training camp after missing the start of it due to a hamstring injury and competed with veteran Mike Logan in training camp for the vacant starting strong safety job left by Lee Flowers.

Polamalu made his professional regular season debut in the Steelers&#x27; season-opening 34–15 victory over the Baltimore Ravens. The following week, he made his first career tackle and finished with two solo tackles during a 41–20 loss at the Kansas City Chiefs. On November 30, 2003, he made four combined tackles and had his first career sack on Cincinnati Bengals&#x27; quarterback Jon Kitna, in a 24–20 loss. On December 23, 2003, Polamalu recorded a season-high six combined tackles in a 13–6 win against the Cleveland Browns. He finished his rookie season in with a total of 38 combined tackles (30 solo) and four passes defensed in 16 games and zero starts. Throughout the season, he was the backup strong safety and played primarily on special teams and in dime packages. Defensive coordinator Tim Lewis was fired after the 2003 season.

===2004===
Head coach Bill Cowher named Polamalu the starting strong safety over Mike Logan to start the season and made his first career start in the Steelers&#x27; season-opener against the Oakland Raiders. He made seven combined tackles in their 24–21 victory. The following week, he made a season-high 11 combined tackles, as the Steelers lost 30–13 to the Baltimore Ravens. On September 26, 2004, Polamalu recorded six combined tackles, deflected a pass, and made his first career interception off a pass from A. J. Feeley during a 13–3 victory over the Miami Dolphins. In Week 4, he made six combined tackles, two pass deflections, and intercepted a pass attempt by Carson Palmer and returned it for a 26-yard touchdown during the Steelers&#x27; 28–17 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. In Week 10, against the Cleveland Browns, he earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week. In his first season under new defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau, Polamalu finished with a career-high 96 combined tackles (67 solo), ten pass deflections, five interceptions, and one touchdown in 16 games and 16 starts. He was named to the 2005 Pro Bowl for the first time.

The Steelers finished first atop the AFC North with a 15–1 record. On January 15, 2005, Polamalu started his first career playoff game and collected seven combined tackles, deflected a pass, and intercepted New York Jets&#x27; quarterback Chad Pennington, during the Steelers&#x27; 20–17 victory in the AFC Divisional Round. The Steelers were eliminated the following week after losing 41–27 in the AFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl XXXIX Champions, the New England Patriots.

===2005===
He returned as the starting strong safety in 2005 and started the Steelers&#x27; season-opener against the Tennessee Titans. Polamalu recorded three solo tackles, deflected a pass, and intercepted Steve McNair during the 34–7 victory. On September 18, 2005, Polamalu had six solo tackles and sacked Houston Texans&#x27; quarterback David Carr three times during a 27–7 victory. He set the NFL record for the most sacks by a safety in a single game. On October 31, 2005, he collected a season-high ten combined tackles in a 20–19 victory over the Baltimore Ravens. The Steelers received a playoff berth after finishing second in the AFC North with an 11–5 record. Polamalu finished the season with 91 combined tackles (73 solo), six pass deflections, and two interceptions in 16 games and 16 starts. The 2006 Pro Bowl was his second consecutive Pro Bowl appearance. In addition, he was named as a First Team All-Pro.

On January 8, 2006, Polamalu made six combined tackles and intercepted a pass in a 31–17 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC wild card game. On February 5, 2006, he started in his first career Super Bowl and collected five combined tackles in the Steelers&#x27; 21–10 win against the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL.

===2006===
In the Steelers&#x27; season-opener against the Miami Dolphins, Polamalu collected a season-high ten combined tackles, defended two passes, and intercepted a pass attempt by Joey Harrington in the Steelers 28–17 victory. On October 15, 2006, he recorded a season-high nine solo tackles, a season-high three pass deflections, and returned an interception for 49-yards during a 45–7 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. He earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his game against the Chiefs. He missed Weeks 13–15 with a shoulder injury. Polamalu finished the season with 76 combined tackles (57 solo), seven pass deflections, and three interceptions in 13 games and 13 starts. He was voted to his third consecutive Pro Bowl and started the 2007 Pro Bowl at strong safety.

===2007===

On July 23, 2007, the Steelers signed Polamalu to a four-year contract extension worth $30.19 million with $15.37 million guaranteed. The contract made him the highest paid safety in the league, but was surpassed by Bob Sanders on December 28, 2007, when he was signed to a five-year, $37.5 million contract with $20 million in guarantees.

In an article on ESPN.com, Polamalu said, &quot;I did not want to be a player who is jumping from team to team.&quot; Polamalu had repeatedly expressed his intent on staying with the Steelers.

He remained the starting strong safety under new head coach Mike Tomlin. On September 23, 2007, Polamalu recorded an eight combined tackles and made a pass deflection, as the Steelers defeated the San Francisco 49ers 37–16. He was unable to play in a Week 5 contest against the Seattle Seahawks with an abdominal injury. During a Week 15 matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had a season-high ten combined tackles and a pass deflection in a 22–29 loss. Polamalu had an injury plagued season and missed Weeks 12–14 with a sprained knee. He finished the 2007 season with 58 combined tackles (45 solo) and nine pass deflections in 12 games and 11 starts.

Polamalu was named a reserve to the 2008 Pro Bowl despite having no interceptions and only playing in 11 games during the 2007 season.

===2008===
Polamalu suffered a hamstring injury during his off-season workout and missed the entire 2008 training camp. He started the Steelers&#x27; season-opener against the Houston Texans and recorded three solo tackles, deflected a pass, and intercepted a pass attempt by Matt Schaub during their 38–17 victory. The following week, he had his second consecutive interception and four solo tackles as the Steelers defeated the Cleveland Browns, 10–6. He earned AFC Defensive Player of the Week for his game against the Browns. During a Week 3 contest against the Philadelphia Eagles, Polamalu made five solo tackles, deflected a pass, and intercepted a pass attempt by Donovan McNabb during a 15–6 loss. This marked his third consecutive game with an interception. On November 16, 2008, he collected three solo tackles, defended a pass, and intercepted a pass by San Diego Chargers&#x27; quarterback Philip Rivers, in an 11–10 victory. A fumble he returned for a touchdown at the end of the game was taken off the board as the officials ruled that San Diego had made an illegal forward pass, although head referee Scott Green admitted after the game that the touchdown should have been counted. On December 7, 2008, Polamalu recorded a season-high nine combined tackles, deflected a pass, and had his seventh interception of the season off of a pass attempt by Dallas Cowboys&#x27; quarterback Tony Romo during a 20–13 victory. This marked his fourth consecutive game with an interception. He finished the season with 73 combined tackles (54 solo), a career-high 17 pass deflections, and a career-high seven interceptions in 16 games and 16 starts. Polamalu was named to the 2009 Pro Bowl as the AFC&#x27;s strong safety after being given a unanimous vote by five experts. He earned his second First-team All-Pro honor.

The Steelers finished first atop the AFC North with a 12–4 record. On January 18, 2009, Polamalu made four combined tackles, deflected two passes, and intercepted a pass by Joe Flacco and returned it for a 40-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter of the Steelers&#x27; 23–14 victory over the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship. He went on to start in Super Bowl XLIII and assisted in making two tackles in the Steelers&#x27; victory over the Arizona Cardinals, 27–23.

===2009===
On April 24, 2009, it was reported that Polamalu would be featured on the cover of Madden NFL 2010, alongside Super Bowl XLIII opponent and Arizona Cardinals&#x27; wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald.

In the Steelers 2009 season-opener against the Tennessee Titans, Polamalu recorded six tackles and made a one handed interception on a pass attempt by Kerry Collins before getting injured while trying to recover a blocked field goal.

He missed the remainder of the season and when asked on why he didn&#x27;t return by John Harris of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Polamalu stated, &quot;If I would have injured it again, the doctor was saying that it will be a career-ending injury, most likely. I had to face that.&quot; Polamalu finished the season with 20 combined tackles (18 solo), seven pass deflections, and three interceptions in only five games and five starts.

==NFL career statistics==

=== Postseason ===
==Personal life==
Polamalu&#x27;s surname at birth was Aumua. He petitioned in 2007 to change his legal surname to his mother&#x27;s maiden name of Polamalu. He had already been using Polamalu for the previous 15 years.

Polamalu&#x27;s favorite pastimes include surfing, growing flowers, making furniture, and playing the piano.

In 2009, Polamalu said that he tried to separate himself from his profession as much as possible and did not watch football games at home. As of 2009, he resided with his family in Pittsburgh during the football season and in San Diego, California during the off-season.

During the 2011 NFL lockout, Polamalu utilized his time away from the field to return to the University of Southern California to complete his college education. On May 13, 2011, he graduated from USC with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history. On his personal website he explained, &quot;I decided to finish what I started and walked that stage today not only because it was very important to me personally, but because I want to emphasize the importance of education, and that nothing should supersede it.&quot; Teammate Ben Roethlisberger followed in Polamalu&#x27;s footsteps the following off-season and finished his degree as well.

===Family===
Polamalu&#x27;s uncle, Kennedy Polamalu, was a former Las Vegas Raiders running backs coach. He was the Jacksonville Jaguars running backs coach for five years, and also served as offensive coordinator for UCLA. Another uncle, Aoatoa Polamalu, played nose tackle at Penn State from 1984 to 1988.

Despite Polamalu&#x27;s hard-hitting style on the gridiron, he became known off the field as a soft-spoken family man. Polamalu is married to Theodora Holmes and has two sons: Paisios, born in 2008, and Ephraim, born in 2010. Theodora is the sister of NFL player and USC Trojans alumnus Alex Holmes and Khaled Holmes. Polamalu and Theodora founded the Harry Panos Fund to honor Theodora&#x27;s grandfather, who served in World War II.

===Faith===
Polamalu is well-read in the history and theology of early Christianity, which ultimately led both him and his wife to convert to Orthodox Christianity in 2007. He made the Sign of the Cross after every play. Among his spiritual activities was a 2007 pilgrimage to Orthodox Christian sites in Greece and Turkey. He seldom gives interviews, but when he does, he often speaks of the role his spirituality plays in his life. During his NFL career, he prayed after each play and prayed on the sidelines. His sons are both named after Orthodox Christian saints: Saint Paisios the Great of Egypt and Saint Ephraim the Syrian.

===Hair===
Polamalu&#x27;s hair is one of his most distinguishing characteristics. In the &quot;CBS Playoffs Pre-game Show&quot;, Polamalu said the last time he had gotten a haircut was in 2000 at USC.

In an October 15, 2006, game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Chiefs&#x27; running back Larry Johnson pulled Polamalu down by the hair in order to tackle him. Afterward, Polamalu took out an insurance policy on his hair.

Polamalu had a contract with Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and has starred in five commercials for the product. On April 1, 2013, it was reported that he had decided not to sign a new contract to endorse Head &amp; Shoulders and instead signed a five-year contract with Suave to endorse their &quot;Action Series&quot;.

===Business===
Polamalu is an investor in Arenda Capital, which is called a multi-family office that pulls together the funds of four families and manages their spending and investments. Any large purchases or investments must be approved by all members of the office. Arenda Capital makes investments into real estate properties and shares the earnings among all of the partners within the office. Polamalu joined Arenda Capital in 2010.

==In the media==
In 2005, Pittsburgh-area band Mr. Devious wrote and recorded the novelty song &quot;Puhlahmahlu&quot;, a parody of the song &quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot;. Guitarist Glenn Shirey said that the song was inspired by Fox Sports announcer Dick Stockton&#x27;s mispronunciation of Polamalu&#x27;s name.

Polamalu is featured on the cover of the Scholastic children&#x27;s book &quot;National Football League Megastars&quot; which profiles Polamalu and 14 other NFL stars.

During Super Bowl XLIII, a commercial of Polamalu aired that had him do a remake of the famous &quot;Mean Joe&quot; Greene Coca-Cola commercial, except it was advertising for Coca-Cola Zero instead. Two Coke &quot;brand managers&quot; take the Coke Zero bottle away right when the kid is to give it to Polamalu, with Polamalu subsequently tackling one of the managers. Then, instead of giving the kid his own jersey, he rips the shirt off the brand manager he has tackled and tosses it to the kid. Greene, who like Polamalu lives a very quiet life off the field in contrast to his on-field play, liked the commercial and gave his stamp of approval.

He was on the cover of &quot;Madden NFL 10&quot; with Larry Fitzgerald and is supposedly a sufferer of the &quot;Madden Curse&quot;.

Polamalu voiced Villager #1 in the 2016 film &quot;Moana&quot;.

Since 2019, he and Patrick Mahomes have appeared in commercials for Head &amp; Shoulders.

<doc id="1249076" wikidata="Q1293760" url="?curid=1249076" title="Tim Witherspoon">
<text>Tim Witherspoon (born December 27, 1957) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1979 to 2003. He was a two-time world heavyweight champion, having held the WBC title in 1984, and the WBA title in 1986. He beat heavyweight world champions Greg Page, James Smith, Tony Tubbs, Frank Bruno and cruiserweight world champions Alfonzo Ratliff and Al Cole. He is best known for his fight against undefeated heavyweight world champion Larry Holmes in which he lost by split decision. Witherspoon also worked as a regular sparring partner for Muhammad Ali.

==Professional career==
===Early years===
Witherspoon had six amateur bouts, losing the last to Marvis Frazier on decision after getting knocked down.

Making his professional debut with a first-round TKO over Joe Adams on October 30, 1979, Witherspoon quickly rose through the ranks. In 1981, he participated in his first high-profile fight, knocking out future world cruiserweight champion Alfonzo Ratliff, after which he was signed by Don King. Witherspoon was a sparring partner of Ali as he was training to fight Larry Holmes and Trevor Berbick. Ali also gave Witherspoon his complimentary ring alias of &quot;Terrible&quot; Tim Witherspoon.

In 1982, he was matched with Renaldo Snipes, who had just given champion Larry Holmes a fair challenge (and knocked Holmes down), and outpointed him over 10 rounds, setting up his own challenge to Holmes.

===Witherspoon vs. Larry Holmes: WBC heavyweight title===

On May 20, 1983, Witherspoon would have his first attempt at earning a world title by taking on the recognized top man in the division World Boxing Council champion Larry Holmes at the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas. Witherspoon gave Holmes all he could handle, including rocking him badly in the ninth round, before losing a disputed twelve round split decision.

He returned later in the year to outpoint Floyd &quot;Jumbo&quot; Cummings, who had drawn with Joe Frazier in Smokin&#x27; Joe&#x27;s last fight, and win the NABF title with a first-round knockout of James &quot;Quick&quot; Tillis.

===First title reign: WBC heavyweight champion===

In December 1983, Holmes relinquished his WBC title rather than defend against Greg Page, and chose to accept that of the newly formed IBF (International Boxing Federation).

Witherspoon was matched with Page for the vacant title on March 9, 1984. Page, in constant war with promoter Don King, turned up overweight and was outpointed.

Witherspoon&#x27;s reign as champion would not be long however, as soon he himself was in constant war with King, and on August 31 of that year he was outpointed by Pinklon Thomas via majority decision.

===Second title reign: WBA heavyweight champion===

In 1985 Witherspoon regained his NABF belt by beating James Broad in two rounds and made a successful twelve round defense against James &quot;Bonecrusher&quot; Smith in his first defense of the belt. This earned him another chance at a heavyweight title and he signed to fight reigning WBA champion Tony Tubbs on January 17, 1986 in Atlanta. Witherspoon won a close fight by majority decision, winning by only one point on one of the scorecards and three on another with one even, to become champion for a second time.

In his first defense of his newly won championship, Witherspoon traveled to London and fought a young up-and-coming English heavyweight and future world champion Frank Bruno at Wembley Stadium, as part of the heavyweight unification series. In the eleventh round of a scheduled fifteen, Witherspoon recorded a technical knockout and did something he had not done when he was champion the first time: make a successful defense of the title after winning it. After defeating Bruno, a rematch with Tony Tubbs loomed but Tubbs pulled out of the fight.

Needing to make a title defense, Witherspoon accepted a second fight with Bonecrusher Smith. Since dropping a lopsided decision in their first matchup (losing every round but one on all three scorecards) Smith had fought four bouts and recorded three wins, all against fringe contenders and journeymen. The fight was scheduled for December 12, 1986 at Madison Square Garden and Witherspoon a heavy favorite against the 17-5 Smith. With fifty seconds remaining in the first round, Witherspoon hit the canvas a third time and Rivera ended the proceedings. At ringside, HBO commentators Barry Tompkins, Larry Merchant, and Sugar Ray Leonard expressed disbelief at the outcome, with all three calling the bout a major upset.

===Post-championship career===
Following the end his second title reign, Witherspoon spent years in litigation against Don King. In 1991 won the USBA heavyweight title by defeating fellow contender Carl &quot;The Truth&quot; Williams but lost a points decision to Everett Martin. Ring magazine called this inexplicable loss the low point of his career.

In 1993 Don King settled out of court and paid Witherspoon a million dollars. By 1994 Witherspoon had won five fights in a row by knockout. Aged 38 he was signed by HBO and matched in high-profile fights with cruiserweight champion Al Cole and the Cuban amateur Jorge Luis González, both of whom he defeated. Later in the year he was matched with Ray Mercer but lost a 10-round decision.

After that loss Witherspoon laid off a year, and when he came back he was outpointed by Larry Donald on HBO, and, in 1998, lost a close decision when outworked by New Zealander Jimmy Thunder before travelling to Poland to be outpointed by Andrew Golota.

The 43-year-old Witherspoon resurfaced in 2001, knocking out the prospect David Bostice in one round, outpointing Cuban southpaw contender Eliecer Castillo and Syrian Ahmed Abdin, before his revival was ended by Lou Savarese, who stopped him in five rounds.

Witherspoon also competed in Cedric Kushner&#x27;s 2003 Thunderbox Heavyweight Tournament, &quot;Fistful of Dollars,&quot; but lost in the opening stages.

==Life after boxing==
Witherspoon resides near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he trains boxers, including his son, lightweight Tim Witherspoon Jr. and many others. He has also trained Light Heavyweight champion Clinton Woods in the U.K.

In 2014, Witherspoon published his book with the help of British entrepreneur Kevin Baker and ghost writer Ryan Danes.

<doc id="1249082" wikidata="Q1785574" url="?curid=1249082" title="Harry Boland">
<text>Harry Boland (27 April 1887 – 1 August 1922) was an Irish republican politician who served as President of the Irish Republican Brotherhood from 1919 to 1920. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1918 to 1922.

He was elected at the 1918 general election as the MP for Roscommon South, but as with other Sinn Féin candidates, he did not take seat in the British House of Commons, serving instead as a TD in the First Dáil.

At the 1921 general election, Boland was elected to the second Dáil as one of the TDs for the Mayo South–Roscommon South. He was re-elected in 1922 as an Anti-Treaty candidate, but was killed two months later in the Irish Civil War.

==Early life==
Boland was born at 6 Dalymount Terrace, Phibsborough, Dublin, on 27 April 1887, the son of Irish Republican Brotherhood member James Boland and Kate Woods. He was active in GAA circles in early life, and refereed the 1914 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. He joined the IRB at the same time as his older brother Gerry in 1904, following in the footsteps of his father, uncle and probably grandfather. He was educated at the Synge Street CBS, but had a personality clash with one of the brothers so he refused to carry on his attendance at the school. He then went to De la Salle College, County Laois, as a novice.

==Irish nationalism== 
Boland later joined the Irish Volunteers along with Gerry and his younger brother Ned. They took an active part in the Easter Rising of 1916. 

At the 1918 general election, Boland was elected as an MP for the Roscommon South seat. In line with all the Sinn Féin MPs elected at that election, he did not represent his constituents at Westminster, but withdrew to sit in the declared independent Dáil Éireann (the First Dáil) and was named by Éamon de Valera as special envoy to the United States, a role his uncle Jack had played 25 years previously. He left Ireland for the United States of America along with de Valera as part of a campaign to raise awareness and support for their cause in America. Boland negotiated a loan of $20,000 from the Irish Republic to the Soviet Republic through the head of the Soviet Bureau, Ludwig Martens, using some Russian jewellery as collateral. These jewels were transferred to Ireland when he returned.

During the Irish War of Independence, Boland operated alongside Michael Collins, of whom he was a close friend. Boland was also a devoted follower of de Valera.

==Civil War==
Boland opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty. In the ensuing Irish Civil War, he sided with the Anti-Treaty IRA which brought him into disagreement with his friend &quot;Mick&quot; Collins. Prior to the start of violence, he said: &quot;It&#x27;s going to be war, and I&#x27;m not going to fire on Mick. So I can&#x27;t fire on any of Mick&#x27;s men. In the 1922 general election, he was re-elected to the Dáil representing Mayo South–Roscommon South. Six weeks later, on 31 July, Boland was shot by soldiers of the National Army when they attempted to arrest him at the Skerries Grand Hotel. Two officers entered his room and Boland, who was unarmed, was shot and mortally wounded during a struggle:

He died the next day in St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital on 1 August 1922. As he lay dying, he refused to give the name of his attacker to his sister, Kathleen.

He was buried at Glasnevin Cemetery. The service took place from the Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church. The hearse was followed by Cumann na mBan, Clan na Gael and the Citizen Army women&#x27;s section.

==Family==
Boland&#x27;s brother, Gerald Boland, was a prominent member of Fianna Fáil and later served as Minister for Justice. His nephew, Kevin Boland, served as a Minister until he resigned in solidarity with the two ministers, Charles Haughey and Neil Blaney, who were sacked from the government in May 1970 during the Arms Crisis. Kevin Boland&#x27;s resignation from Fianna Fáil and the subsequent loss of his seat marked the end of an era for the Boland political dynasty.

His nephew, Harry Boland, was a basketball player who competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. He died on 18 December 2013, at the age of 88.

He also had a sister, Kathleen, who was entrusted, with her mother, with the safekeeping of jewels received from Russian diplomats as collateral for a loan made by the provisional government to the new Russian state in April 1920.

==In popular culture==
In the 1991 TV movie &quot;The Treaty&quot;, Boland was portrayed by Malcolm Douglas.

In the 1996 film &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, Boland was portrayed by Irish-American actor Aidan Quinn. The film was criticised for fictionalising both Boland&#x27;s death and aspects of Collins&#x27; life.

<doc id="1249097" wikidata="Q1045113" url="?curid=1249097" title="Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū">
<text>is a Japanese ward of the city of Kitakyushu in Fukuoka Prefecture. It is the former city of Moji which was one of five merged to create Kitakyūshū in 1963. It faces the city of Shimonoseki across the Kanmon Straits between Honshū and Kyūshū.

The ward&#x27;s area is 73.37 km2. It had a population of 114,754 as of 2000.

==History==
Moji was first made into a port by Suematsu Kenchō with the financial backing of Shibusawa Eiichi in 1889. It was chiefly used for the transportation of coal, though there is a traditional song about the sale of bananas imported into Moji from Southeast Asia which survives to this day (&quot;Banana no tataki-uri&quot;).

An imperial decree in July 1899 established Moji as an open port for trading with the United States and the United Kingdom.

In 1905, Moji was the departure point for many troops in the Russo-Japanese War who were ferried to Korea.

==Tourism==

=== The Mojiko Retro District===

Mojiko Retro, which officially opened under this name as a tourist site in 1995, is a historical area centered on JR Kyushu&#x27;s Mojiko Station, which is a replica of Rome&#x27;s Termini Station and is designated an Important Cultural Property
of Japan.

The area boasts many interesting historic buildings. For instance, the former Moji Mitsui Club once hosted Dr. Albert Einstein and his wife when they visited Japan in the 1920s. Recent developments along the waterfront, such as the renovated customs building, a striking new hotel and the a unique pedestrian Blue Wing drawbridge add to the charm of Mojiko and make it a pleasant place to stroll.

=== Shiranoe Gardens ===

The Shiranoe botanical gardens face the Seto Inland Sea.

==Transport==
Several ferry companies connect Kitakyushu with Tokyo and Osaka via Shin-Moji port on the Seto Inland Sea.

Moji is served by the Kagoshima Main Line, operated by JR Kyushu, and the Mojikō Retro Scenic Line, operated by Heichiku. Rail tunnels connect Kyushu and Honshu via Moji Station.

<doc id="1249100" wikidata="Q17032364" url="?curid=1249100" title="Wachovia Tract">
<text>Wachovia () was the area settled by Moravians in what is now Forsyth County, North Carolina, United States. Of the six 18th-century Moravian &quot;villages of the Lord&quot; established in Wachovia, today only the town of Bethania and city of Winston-Salem exist within the historic Wachovia Tract. The historical tract was somewhat larger than present-day Winston-Salem and somewhat smaller than present-day Forsyth County.

==History==
Wachovia&#x27;s early settlers were mostly German-speaking people who shared a common Germanic cultural background.

In 1752 Moravian Bishop August Gottlieb &quot;Brother Joseph&quot; Spangenberg led an expedition to locate the area where the Unitas Fratrum, or Moravian church, intended to begin the Wachovia settlements. Members of the Moravian Church in Europe purchased of land in the backcountry (middle/western area) of the Province of North Carolina, from John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville.

The land in North Carolina was purchased on behalf of the Moravians by John Henry (Johann Heinrich) Antes, who had also served as agent on behalf of the Moravians in the purchase of the tract which became the city of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He also served as &quot;Baumeister&quot; (&quot;construction manager&quot;) of the first buildings which still stand in Bethlehem&#x27;s historic district. were purchased by Johann Steinhauer, leader of the Moravian church in Riga (today&#x27;s Latvia).

&quot;Wachovia&quot; is a Latinized form of the German name &quot;Wachau&quot;. It was chosen as the name of the North Carolina Moravian tract to honor Count Zinzendorf, Moravian patron and bishop whose family estate was located in the Wachau region northwest of Vienna, along the Danube River between the towns of Melk and Krems. Bishop Spangenberg and the surveying team in 1752 strayed into the mountains of western North Carolina, coming down through what is now Wilkes County (viz. &quot;Moravian Falls&quot; etc.) on their way to the Three Forks of Muddy Creek. It was this mountainous landscape in the Carolina back country along the Catawba, Little, New and Yadkin Rivers that suggested the Wachau region in Lower Austria.

Twelve Moravian Single Brethren traveling from Pennsylvania, most from the Christiansbrunn farm near Nazareth, arrived in Wachovia in 1753, forming Bethabara, in Hebrew meaning &quot;House of Passage&quot;, a transitional congregational settlement founded November 17, 1753. In July 1756, during the French and Indian War (1754–1763), a wooden stockade was built around the central-most area of the Moravian settlement, and Bethabara became a place of refuge for settlers from across the region, with many refugees living near the Bethabara Mill, numbering 120 by May 1759.

The first planned Moravian settlement, and oldest incorporated municipality in Wachovia is Bethania, Province of North Carolina, formed June 12, 1759, also known historically as Bethany, meaning &quot;house/place of dates and figs&quot; in Hebrew. &quot;Bethania&quot; is the German form of &quot;Bethany&quot;. The Town of Bethania was incorporated in 1995, following the reactivation of Bethania&#x27;s 1838/1839 town charter, and was spared from being annexed into the city of Winston-Salem. Today, Bethania remains the only independent, continuously active Moravian town in the southern United States. In 2007, Historic Bethania, a visitor center and museum, opened in Bethania, providing information and historical interpretation in yet another Wachovia Moravian community.

Wachovia&#x27;s central administrative congregational town of Salem can be visited today at Old Salem Museums and Gardens. Salem was begun in 1766 (formally organized in 1771), and was built by Moravians and friends from Bethabara and Bethania.

Subsequent Moravian congregational settlements to be formed include Friedberg (1769), Friedland (1772), and Hope (1775). The congregation at Hope was the first &quot;English&quot; Moravian church in the area.

A secular county seat was founded in 1849 in newly drawn Forsyth County, north of Salem. The new county seat was named Winston in 1852. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, maker of Winston, Salem, and Camel cigarettes, was founded at Winston in 1875. The towns of Salem and Winston merged as Winston-Salem in 1913. Bethabara now lies within the city limits of Winston-Salem, and can be visited today at Historic Bethabara Park, operated by the city of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County.

Over time, the Wachovia Tract was redrawn into the following counties as the backcountry of North Carolina became increasingly populated:

* 1753 Rowan County
* 1771 Surry County
* 1789 Stokes County
* 1849 Forsyth County was drawn out of what had been the southern half of Stokes County

==Museums==
Historic Bethabara Park, Historic Bethania, and Old Salem Museums and Gardens are museums which serve to transport visitors in time to what Wachovia once was. The museums each contribute to the story of Moravians in North Carolina, and preserve, interpret, and demonstrate life in Wachovia over time.

==Wachovia Corporation==
The area is the namesake and birthplace of Wachovia Corporation, once one of the world&#x27;s largest banks. The bank was pioneered by Bethanian I.G. Loesch. Salem, then Winston-Salem, was the corporate headquarters for the bank until its merger with the First Union corporation, when the headquarters was moved to Charlotte, North Carolina.

==Linguistic note==
Present day students and scholars who are not familiar with the German language frequently, albeit incorrectly, use a masculine article &quot;der&quot; to modify &quot;Wachau&quot; when the feminine article &quot;die&quot; should be used, as historically documented. When speaking of &quot;Wachovia&quot; as a place, the proper title in German is &quot;die Wachau&quot;. When speaking of &quot;Wachau&quot; in a locative sense, such as &quot;in the Wachau,&quot; the article becomes dative and written as &quot;in der Wachau.&quot; Many individuals and organizations have seen the dative phrase and have irresponsibly and unknowingly dropped the preposition, leaving &quot;...der Wachau,&quot; which is incorrect when used as a proper noun. The feminine gender of &quot;die Wachau&quot; does not change, though the case might.

<text>Claude Cahun (, born Lucy Renee Mathilde Schwob; 25 October 1894 – 8 December 1954) was a French surrealist photographer, sculptor, and writer.

Schwob adopted the pseudonym Claude Cahun in 1914. Cahun is best known as a writer and self-portraitist, who assumed a variety of performative personae.

In her writing, Cahun mostly referred to herself with grammatically feminine words, but she also said that her actual gender was fluid. For example, in &quot;Disavowals&quot;, Cahun writes: &quot;Masculine? Feminine? It depends on the situation. is the only gender that always suits me.&quot; Cahun is most well known for her androgynous appearance, which challenged the strict gender roles of her time.

During World War II, Cahun was also active as a resistance worker and propagandist, founding the leftist group Contre Attaque, a union of communist writers, artists and workers, alongside André Breton and Marcel Moore.

==Early life==
Cahun was born in Nantes in 1894, into a well-off literary Jewish family. Avant-garde writer Marcel Schwob was her uncle and Orientalist David Léon Cahun was her great-uncle. When Cahun was four years old, her mother, Mary-Antoinette Courbebaisse, began suffering from mental illness, which ultimately led to her mother&#x27;s permanent internment at a psychiatric facility. In her mother&#x27;s absence, Cahun was brought up by her grandmother, Mathilde.

Cahun attended a private school (Parsons Mead School) in Surrey after experiences with antisemitism at high school in Nantes. She attended the University of Paris, Sorbonne. She began making photographic self-portraits as early as 1912 (aged 18), and continued taking images of herself throughout the 1930s.

Around 1914, she changed her name to Claude Cahun, after having previously used the names Claude Courlis (after the curlew) and Daniel Douglas (after Lord Alfred Douglas). During the early 1920s, she settled in Paris with lifelong partner Suzanne Malherbe, who adopted the pseudonym &quot;Marcel Moore&quot;. The two became step-sisters in 1917 after Cahun&#x27;s divorced father and Moore&#x27;s widowed mother married, eight years after Cahun and Moore&#x27;s artistic and romantic partnership began. For the rest of their lives together, Cahun and Moore collaborated on various written works, sculptures, photomontages and collages. The two published articles and novels, notably in the periodical &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, and befriended Henri Michaux, Pierre Morhange, and Robert Desnos.

Around 1922 Cahun and Moore began holding artists&#x27; salons at their home. Among the regulars who would attend were artists Henri Michaux and André Breton and literary entrepreneurs Sylvia Beach and Adrienne Monnier.

==Work==

Cahun&#x27;s works encompassed writing, photography, sculpture and theatre, of which the most remembered are the highly staged self-portraits and tableaux that incorporated the visual aesthetics of Surrealism. During the 1920s, Cahun produced an astonishing number of self-portraits in various guises such as aviator, dandy, doll, body builder, vamp and vampire, angel, and Japanese puppet.

Cahun gave a unique perspective within surrealism, using mirrors, collages and doubling in her photos to reflect the diversion from social norms.

Some of Cahun&#x27;s portraits feature the artist looking directly at the viewer, head shaven, often revealing only head and shoulders (eliminating body from the view), and a blurring of gender indicators and behaviors which serve to undermine the patriarchal gaze. For example; in one photo Cahun is seen in a top that reads &#x27;i am in training, do not kiss me.&#x27; showing how her identity and gender is allowed to be seen but should not be objectified and exoticized by the male gaze. Scholar Miranda Welby-Everard has written about the importance of theatre, performance, and costume that underlies Cahun&#x27;s work, suggesting how this may have informed the artist&#x27;s varying gender presentations.

Cahun&#x27;s published writings include &quot;Heroines&quot;, (1925) a series of monologues based upon female fairy tale characters intertwined with witty comparisons to the contemporary image of women; &quot;Aveux non avenus&quot;, (Carrefour, 1930) a book of essays and recorded dreams illustrated with photomontages; and several essays in magazines and journals.

In 1932, Cahun joined the Association des Écrivains et Artistes Révolutionnaires, where she met André Breton and René Crevel. Following this, Cahun began associating with the surrealist group and later participated in a number of surrealist exhibitions, including the London International Surrealist Exhibition (New Burlington Gallery) and Exposition surréaliste d&#x27;Objets (Charles Ratton Gallery, Paris), both in 1936. Cahun&#x27;s photograph from the London exhibition of Sheila Legge standing in the middle of Trafalgar Square, her head obscured by a flower arrangement and pigeons perching on her outstretched arms, appeared in numerous newspapers and was later reproduced in a number of books. In 1934, Cahun published a short polemic essay, &quot;Les Paris sont Ouverts&quot;, and in 1935 took part in the founding of the left-wing anti-fascist alliance &quot;Contre Attaque&quot;, alongside André Breton and Georges Bataille. Breton called Cahun &quot;one of the most curious spirits of our time.&quot;

In 1994, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London held an exhibition of Cahun&#x27;s photographic self-portraits from 1927 to 1947, alongside the work of two young contemporary British artists, Virginia Nimarkoh and Tacita Dean, entitled &quot;Mise en Scene&quot;. In the surrealist self-portraits, Cahun represented herself as an androgyne, nymph, model, and soldier.

In 2007, David Bowie created a multi-media exhibition of Cahun&#x27;s work in the gardens of the General Theological Seminary in New York. It was part of a venue called the Highline Festival, which also included offerings by Air, Laurie Anderson, and Mike Garson. Bowie said of Cahun:
=== Collaboration with Marcel Moore ===
Cahun&#x27;s work was often a collaboration with Marcel Moore (the pseudonym of Suzanne Malherbe). It is believed that they were lovers with Moore being an integral part of Cahun&#x27;s creative and playful process, though this often goes unrecognized. It is believed that Moore was often the person standing behind the camera during Cahun&#x27;s portrait shoots and was an equal partner in Cahun&#x27;s collages.

With the majority of the photographs attributed to Cahun coming from a personal collection, not one meant for public display, it has been proposed that these personal photographs allowed for Cahun to experiment with gender presentation and the role of the viewer to a greater degree.

==World War II activism==
In 1937 Cahun and Moore settled in Jersey. Following the fall of France and the German occupation of Jersey and the other Channel Islands, they became active as resistance workers and propagandists. Fervently against war, the two worked extensively in producing anti-German fliers. Many were snippets from English-to-German translations of BBC reports on the Nazis&#x27; crimes and insolence, which were pasted together to create rhythmic poems and harsh criticism. They created many of these messages under the German pseudonym Der Soldat Ohne Namen, or The Soldier With No Name, to deceive German soldiers that there was a conspiracy among the occupation troops. The couple then dressed up and attended many German military events in Jersey, strategically placing their pamphlets in soldier&#x27;s pockets, on their chairs, and in cigarette boxes for soldiers to find. Additionally, they inconspicuously crumpled up and threw their fliers into cars and windows.

On one occasion, they hung a banner in a local church which read &quot;Jesus is great, but Hitler is greater – because Jesus died for people, but people die for Hitler.&quot; As with much of Cahun and Moore&#x27;s artistic work in Paris, many of their notes also used this same style of dark humor. In many ways, Cahun and Moore&#x27;s resistance efforts were not only political but artistic actions, using their creative talents to manipulate and undermine the authority which they despised. In many ways, Cahun&#x27;s life&#x27;s work was focused on undermining a certain authority; however, their activism posed a threat to their physical safety. As historian Jeffrey H. Jackson writes in his definitive study of their wartime resistance &quot;Paper Bullets&quot;, for Cahun and Moore, &quot;fighting the German occupation of Jersey was the culmination of lifelong patterns of resistance, which had always borne a political edge in the cause of freedom as they carved out their own rebellious way of living in the world together. For them, the political was always deeply personal.&quot;

In 1944, Cahun and Moore were arrested and sentenced to death, but the sentence was never carried out, as the island was liberated from German occupation in 1945. However, Cahun&#x27;s health never recovered from her treatment in jail, and she died in 1954. Cahun is buried in St Brelade&#x27;s Church with partner Moore. At the trial, Cahun said to the German judge (according to the documentary on the Occupation of the Channel Islands, presented by John Nettles) that the Germans would have to shoot her twice, as she was not only a Resister but a Jew. This apparently brought a peal of laughter from the court and is said to have been one reason the execution was not carried out.

==Social critique and legacy==

Cahun made work for herself and did not want to be famous. Cahun&#x27;s work was largely unrecognized until 40 years after her death. In many ways, Cahun&#x27;s life was marked by actions which revolted against convention, and her public image has since become a commentary which challenges the public&#x27;s notions of gender, beauty, and logic.

Her work was meant to unsettle the audience&#x27;s understanding of photography as a documentation of reality. Furthermore, her poetry challenged gender roles of the time and attacked the increasingly modern world&#x27;s social and economic boundaries. Also, Cahun&#x27;s participation with the Parisian Surrealist group brought an element of diversity to the group&#x27;s output which ushered in new representations. Most Surrealist artists were men, whose primary images of women depicted them as isolated symbols of eroticism rather than as the chameleonic, gender non-conforming figure that Cahun presented. Cahun’s photographs, writings, and general life as an artistic and political revolutionary continues to influence artists.

Twenty-first century writing on Cahun and Moore’s work has described the pair as &quot;prototransgender artists&quot;. Christy Wampole connects Cahun’s adopted name and appearance to twenty-first century genderqueer identities, arguing that Cahun&#x27;s photographs display “transgender signals” and are a prototype of modern trans self-representation.

Cahun&#x27;s collected writings were published in 2002 as &quot;Claude Cahun – Écrits&quot; (), edited by François Leperlier.
In 2018, a street of Paris took the name of &quot;Allée Claude Cahun – Marcel Moore&quot; (area of Saint-Germain-des-Prés – Montparnasse, near the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs where Claude and Suzanne lived).

Rupert Thomson&#x27;s 2018 novel, &quot;Never Anyone But You&quot;, was based on the lives of Cahun and Moore in Paris and Jersey. It was favourably reviewed by Adam Mars-Jones in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;.

Cahun and Moore&#x27;s WWII activism and heroism are documented by Jeffrey H. Jackson in the 2020 book, &quot;Paper Bullets: Two Artists Who Risked Their Lives to Defy the Nazis.&quot;

Google honored Claude Cahun by showing an animated Doodle on its home page in many countries on 25 October 2021, on the anniversary of what would have been her 127th birthday.

&quot;Exist Otherwise&quot; is a literary journal edited by Eric Jennings that takes Claude Cahun as its literary inspiration.

Kaz Rowe, an illustrator, published a biography in graphic novel form on Cahun&#x27;s life in 2023. &quot;Liberated: The Radical Art and Life of Claude Cahun&quot; explores Cahun&#x27;s and Moore&#x27;s involvement in &quot;a radical journey of Surrealist collaboration that would take them from conservative provincial France to the vibrancy of 1920s Paris to the oppression of Nazi-occupied Jersey during World War II, where they used art to undermine the Nazi regime.&quot;

An opera about the lives of Cahun and Moore has been commissioned by West Edge Opera with a planned 2027 premiere.

<text>Aircraft maneuvering is referenced to a standard rate turn, also known as a rate one turn (ROT).

A standard rate turn is defined as a 3° per second turn, which completes a 360° turn in 2 minutes. This is known as a 2-minute turn, or rate one (180°/min). Fast airplanes, or aircraft on certain precision approaches, use a half standard rate (&#x27;rate half&#x27; in some countries), but the definition of standard rate does not change.

== Usage ==
Standardized turn rates are often employed in approaches and holding patterns to provide a reference for controllers and pilots so that each will know what the other is expecting. The pilot banks the airplane such that the turn and slip indicator points to the mark appropriate for that aircraft and then uses a clock to time the turn. The pilot can roll out at any desired direction depending on the length of time in the turn.

During a constant-bank level turn, increasing airspeed decreases the rate of turn, and increases the turn radius. A &quot;rate half turn&quot; (1.5° per second) is normally used when flying faster than 250 kn. The term &quot;rate two turn&quot; (6° per second) is used on some low speed aircraft.

=== Instrumentation ===

Instruments, either the turn and slip indicator or the turn coordinator, have the standard rate or half standard rate turn clearly marked. Slower aircraft are equipped with 2-minute turn indicators while faster aircraft are often equipped with 4-minute turn indicators.

== Formulae ==

=== Angle of bank formula ===

The formula for calculating the angle of bank for a specific true airspeed (TAS) in SI units (or other coherent system) is:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the angle of bank, formula_3 is true airspeed, formula_4 is the radius of the turn, and formula_5 is the acceleration due to gravity.

For a rate-one turn and velocity in knots (nautical miles per hour, symbol kn), this comes to

formula_6.

A convenient approximation for the bank angle in degrees is

formula_7

For aircraft holding purposes, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandates that all turns should be made, &quot;at a bank angle of 25° or at a rate of 3° per second, whichever requires the lesser bank.&quot; By the above formula, a rate-one turn at a TAS greater than 180 knots would require a bank angle of more than 25°. Therefore, faster aircraft just use 25° for their turns.

=== Radius of turn formula ===

One might also want to calculate the radius formula_4 of a Rate 1, 2 or 3 turn at a specific TAS.

formula_9

Where formula_10 is the rate of turn.

If the velocity and the angle of bank is given,

formula_11

where g is the gravitational acceleration. This is a simplified formula that ignores slip and returns zero for 90° of bank.

In metres (where gravity is approximately 9.81 metres per second per second, and velocity is given in metres per second): 

formula_12

Or in feet (where velocity is given in knots): 

formula_13

<text>Old Salem is a historic district of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States, which was originally settled by the Moravian community in 1766. It features a living-history museum which interprets the restored Moravian community. The non-profit organization began its work in 1950, although some private residents had restored buildings earlier. As the Old Salem Historic District, it was declared a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1966, and expanded fifty years later. The district showcases the culture of the Moravian settlement in the Province of North Carolina during the colonial 18th century and post-statehood 19th century via its communal buildings, churches, houses and shops.

Two buildings are individually designated as NHLs: the Salem Tavern and the Single Brothers&#x27; House. Additional buildings and properties have been added to the National Register to expand the historic area (see St. Philips Moravian Church below, Single Brothers Industrial Complex Site and West Salem Historic District). Ownership of the buildings and land is divided among Old Salem, Inc., Wachovia Historical Society, private owners, Salem College, Salem Academy and Salem Congregation (the successor to the Salem Congregational Council, to whom all ownership of Church properties was transferred).

==Historic Salem==

Salem was originally settled by members of the Moravian Church, a Protestant denomination that first began in 1457, out of the followers of Jan Hus (1369–1415) in the Kingdom of Bohemia and Moravia, now part of the Czech Republic. In 1722, the German-speaking exiles finally found protection on the estate of Count Zinzendorf, a Saxon nobleman, where he allowed them to create the village of Herrnhut as their home. First settling in North America in Savannah, Province of Georgia, in 1735, they moved in 1740 to the Province of Pennsylvania, where they founded several communities (Bethlehem, Nazareth and Lititz). Because of development pressures, they looked for more space to create their church communities. Purchasing just over from John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, one of the British Lords Proprietor, in the Piedmont of the Province of North Carolina in 1753, they sent groups from Bethlehem to begin construction. They founded the transitional settlement of Bethabara (translated as &quot;House of Passage,&quot; the first planned Moravian community in North Carolina in 1753, in Bethania), in 1759.

Salem was to be the central town of a tract of land named Wachovia. Construction began in 1766 to build the central economic, religious and administrative center of the tract. The outlying communities, eventually five in all (Bethabara, Bethania, Friedberg, Friedland and Hope), were more rural and agriculture focused. Salem and most of the other communities were controlled by the church, which owned all property and only leased land for construction. The worldwide Moravian Church initially owned the property, but Salem Congregation purchased the town lot outright in 1826. All people in the communities had to be members of the church and could be expelled from the town if they acted contrary to the community&#x27;s regulations. The several governing bodies all kept meticulous records; copies were sent to the Bethlehem and Herrnhut archives. Most of this information has been translated and published in the &quot;Records of the Moravians in North Carolina&quot; by the North Carolina State Archives, now comprising thirteen volumes. This detailed information is part of the documentation used for the accurate restoration and interpretation of Old Salem and many original documents are still housed in the Moravian archives.

* In 1849, Forsyth County was created, but Salem was unwilling to be the county seat and sold property directly to the north to become the new courthouse town. This town became Winston, which quickly grew into a thriving industrial center.
* In 1857, the church divested control of the town and allowed the residents to purchase their property. Salem then became a legal municipality. The town expanded twice, in 1889 and 1907.
* Salem merged with adjacent Winston in 1913, becoming known as Winston-Salem.

A local architectural review district was created in 1948 (the first in North Carolina and probably the fifth in the country) to protect the historic remains of what had become a depressed area from encroaching development. In 1950, Old Salem Inc. (a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation) was formed to protect threatened buildings, restore the town and operate portions of it as a museum.

==Old Salem museums and gardens==

The town&#x27;s restored and reconstructed buildings, staffed by living-history interpreters, present visitors with a view of Moravian life in the 18th and 19th centuries. The features include skilled interpreters such as tinsmiths, blacksmiths, cobblers, gunsmiths, bakers and carpenters, practicing their trades while interacting with visitors. Approximately 70% of the buildings in the historic district are original.

=== Points of interest ===
The village is centered around Salem Square, which is bounded by Academy Street to the north, Church Street to the east, West Street to the south and Main Street to the west. Salem College overlooks the square from Church Street.

Highlights of the town include the Salem Tavern, where George Washington spent two nights (May 31 and June 1, 1791), while passing through North Carolina during his &quot;Southern Tour&quot;; the Single Brothers&#x27; House; Boys&#x27; School; C. Winkler Bakery; and a host of restored homes and shops and several stores including Traugott Bagge Merchant and the Moravian Book and Gift Shop.

Of note is the St. Philip&#x27;s Moravian Church complex. The site of God&#x27;s Acre, an 18th-century graveyard, the (now reconstructed) 1823 &#x27;Negro Church&#x27; was built following a congregational vote to segregate worship in accordance with North Carolina state law in 1816. Before that the African-Americans who joined the Moravian church attended Home Moravian Church. In 1861, St. Philip&#x27;s Church was constructed. Now restored, the church was originally built by the Salem congregation for the enslaved and free African-Americans of the community. Completed just before the Civil War in 1861, it is the oldest surviving African-American church built for that purpose in North Carolina. The Emancipation Proclamation was read there to the congregation in 1865 by the chaplain of the 10th Ohio Regiment. The church continued to grow and was expanded in the 1890s. The congregation moved to a new location in 1952 then a third location on Bon Aire Avenue, before returning to hold services in the brick Church in 2019. The building stood vacant from 1952 until its restoration. St. Philip&#x27;s Church is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Partially in the Old Salem historic district is the campus of Salem College and Academy, with Main Hall, the Single Sisters&#x27; House, the Inspectors House (with the president&#x27;s office and the college book store) on the Square and Gramley Library just down Church Street.

Home Moravian Church, while not a part of the official Old Salem tour per se, this functioning congregation opens its sanctuary to visitors on a regular schedule. Still owned by the Salem Congregation, Salem Square, in the center of the district, hosts many special events throughout the year.

In Salem, the &quot;Easter City,&quot; the traditional Moravian Easter sunrise service has been held annually since 1772 by the Salem Congregation, and draws several thousand people to the Salem Square and Moravian graveyard. The first two weeks of December play host to the Candle Tea, an annual fundraiser for local charities held by the Home Moravian Church Women&#x27;s Fellowship in the Single Brothers&#x27; House.

The Market–Fire Engine House was constructed in 1803 (reconstructed in 1955). Half of it was used as a marketplace for fresh meat, and the other half was used to store fire fighting equipment. The town had been using this equipment since 1785, when the Salem Tavern was destroyed by fire. The fire company is thought to be the first of its kind in North Carolina.

At the north end of the historic district is a large Coffee Pot which is a former tin-shop sign, moved when Interstate 40 was built just to the north.

=== Visitor Center ===
Old Salem&#x27;s Visitor Center was built in 2003 and is the main location where museum visitors purchase tickets. The building features a large concourse along a serpentine glass wall with interpretive panels about the history of Wachovia and Salem. The preliminary design was developed by Venturi Scott Brown and Associates, with local firm Calloway, Johnson, Moore and West completing the project. The building also houses a food service, gift shops and the James A. Gray Jr. Auditorium. The Gray Auditorium is home to the 1800 Tannenberg Organ.

The former 1964 visitor center and parking lot were demolished to allow partial reconstruction of the 18th-century Single Brothers&#x27; Garden.

===Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts===
A part of Old Salem Museums &amp; Gardens and located in a modern building in the historic district, the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts (MESDA) is dedicated to exhibiting and researching the regional decorative arts of the early South. MESDA opened to the public on January 5, 1965. MESDA was founded by Frank L. Horton and his mother Theodosia “Theo” L. Taliaferro, antiques dealers and collectors who spent most of their lives raising awareness of and appreciating domestic objects made in the south. In its galleries, MESDA showcases the architecture, needlework, furniture, paintings, textiles, ceramics, silver and other metalwares made and used in Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky and Tennessee through the early 19th century. The majority of the MESDA collection is accessible online.

== Hidden Town Project ==
Starting in December 2016, substantial historical and archaeological research has focused on Salem&#x27;s historical African-American population. Moravians educated enslaved members of their community, teaching literacy skills and some professional trades. Holistic studies directed toward understanding ethnicity and cultural identity of African-Americans in Salem have resulted in significant additions to the historical interpretation presented at Old Salem. These additions include newly identified slave dwellings and the updated number of slaves who lived in Salem from 1790-1860.

The goals of this project are to:

# To locate the sites of dwelling places of enslaved people throughout the entire historic district
# To archaeologically investigate the sites.
# To fully integrate the narrative of the enslaved into the visitor experience.
# To connect with descendants of the Salem enslaved population and form an Advisory Committee to help direct future efforts at Old Salem.
# To interpret through contemporary art forms, salon discussions and public gatherings.

<doc id="1249119" wikidata="Q4382663" url="?curid=1249119" title="Footman">
<text>A footman is a male domestic worker employed mainly to wait at table or attend a coach or carriage.

==Etymology==
Originally in the 14th century a footman denoted a soldier or any pedestrian, later it indicated a foot servant. A running footman delivered messages. He might run beside or behind the carriages of aristocrats, running alongside the coach to make sure it was not overturned by such obstacles as ditches or tree roots. A footman might also run ahead to the destination to prepare for his lord&#x27;s arrival.

==Roles==
The name was applied to a household servant who waited at table and attended, rode on his employer&#x27;s coach or carriage in case of untoward incidents. In many cases, a footman was expected to serve as an armed bodyguard. Many were skilled with pistols to defend their employer&#x27;s coach against highwaymen. 

The &quot;first footman&quot; was the designation given to the highest-ranking servant of this class in a given household. The first footman would serve as deputy butler and act as butler in the latter&#x27;s absence, although some larger houses also had an under-butler above the first footman.

In a larger household, various footmen might be assigned specific duties (for which there might be a traditional sequence), such as the silver specialist. Usually the footmen performed a range of duties which included serving meals, opening and closing doors, carrying heavy items, or moving furniture for the housemaid to clean behind. The footmen might also double as valets, especially for visiting guests.

==Servants==
Male servants were paid more than female servants and footmen were something of a luxury and therefore a status symbol even among the servant-employing classes. They performed a less essential role than the cook, maid or even butler, and were employed only by the grandest households. Since a footman was for show as much as for work, his good looks were highly prized, including a tall stature and well-turned legs, shown off by the traditional footman&#x27;s dress of stockings below knee breeches. Footmen were expected to be unmarried and tended to be relatively young; they might, however, progress to other posts, notably that of butler. One 19th-century footman, William Tayler, kept a diary which has been published. He was, in fact, married, but he kept it secret from his employers and visited his family only on his days off.

Once a common position in great houses, the footman became much rarer after World War I as fewer households could afford large retinues. The role is now virtually a historic one, although servants with this designation are still employed in the British Royal Household, wearing a distinctive scarlet livery on state occasions.

===Famous fictional footmen===
* In Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, the Queen of Hearts&#x27; Fish Footman delivers a croquet invitation to the Duchess&#x27;s Frog Footman, which he then presents to the Duchess.
* George (Richard E. Grant), first footman in service to Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon), in the 2001 film &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, directed by Robert Altman.
* Thomas Barrow (Rob James-Collier) and William Mason (Thomas Howes) serve as first and second footman, respectively, to Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) in the Julian Fellowes period drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;.

<doc id="1249122" wikidata="Q625083" url="?curid=1249122" title="Water supply network">
<text>A water supply network or water supply system is a system of engineered hydrologic and hydraulic components that provide water supply. A water supply system typically includes the following:
# A drainage basin (see water purification – sources of drinking water)
# A raw water collection point (above or below ground) where the water accumulates, such as a lake, a river, or groundwater from an underground aquifer. Raw water may be transferred using uncovered ground-level aqueducts, covered tunnels, or underground water pipes to water purification facilities.
# Water purification facilities. Treated water is transferred using water pipes (usually underground).
# Water storage facilities such as reservoirs, water tanks, or water towers. Smaller water systems may store the water in cisterns or pressure vessels. Tall buildings may also need to store water locally in pressure vessels in order for the water to reach the upper floors.
# Additional water pressurizing components such as pumping stations may need to be situated at the outlet of underground or aboveground reservoirs or cisterns (if gravity flow is impractical).
# A pipe network for distribution of water to consumers (which may be private houses or industrial, commercial, or institution establishments) and other usage points (such as fire hydrants)
# Connections to the sewers (underground pipes, or aboveground ditches in some developing countries) are generally found downstream of the water consumers, but the sewer system is considered to be a separate system, rather than part of the water supply system.

Water supply networks are often run by public utilities of the water industry.

==Water abstraction and raw water transfer==
Raw water (untreated) is from a surface water source (such as an intake on a lake or a river) or from a groundwater source (such as a water well drawing from an underground aquifer) within the watershed that provides the water resource.

The raw water is transferred to the water purification facilities using uncovered aqueducts, covered tunnels or underground water pipes.

==Water treatment==

Virtually all large systems must treat the water; a fact that is tightly regulated by global, state and federal agencies, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) or the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Water treatment must occur before the product reaches the consumer and afterwards (when it is discharged again). Water purification usually occurs close to the final delivery points to reduce pumping costs and the chances of the water becoming contaminated after treatment.

Traditional surface water treatment plants generally consists of three steps: clarification, filtration and disinfection. Clarification refers to the separation of particles (dirt, organic matter, etc.) from the water stream. Chemical addition (i.e. alum, ferric chloride) destabilizes the particle charges and prepares them for clarification either by settling or floating out of the water stream. Sand, anthracite or activated carbon filters refine the water stream, removing smaller particulate matter. While other methods of disinfection exist, the preferred method is via chlorine addition. Chlorine effectively kills bacteria and most viruses and maintains a residual to protect the water supply through the supply network.

==Water distribution network==

The product, delivered to the point of consumption, is called potable water if it meets the water quality standards required for human consumption.

The water in the supply network is maintained at positive pressure to ensure that water reaches all parts of the network, that a sufficient flow is available at every take-off point and to ensure that untreated water in the ground cannot enter the network. The water is typically pressurised by pumping the water into storage tanks constructed at the highest local point in the network. One network may have several such service reservoirs.

In small domestic systems, the water may be pressurised by a pressure vessel or even by an underground cistern (the latter however does need additional pressurizing). This eliminates the need of a water tower or any other heightened water reserve to supply the water pressure.

These systems are usually owned and maintained by local governments such as cities or other public entities, but are occasionally operated by a commercial enterprise (see water privatization). Water supply networks are part of the master planning of communities, counties, and municipalities. Their planning and design requires the expertise of city planners and civil engineers, who must consider many factors, such as location, current demand, future growth, leakage, pressure, pipe size, pressure loss, fire fighting flows, etc.—using pipe network analysis and other tools.

As water passes through the distribution system, the water quality can degrade by chemical reactions and biological processes. Corrosion of metal pipe materials in the distribution system can cause the release of metals into the water with undesirable aesthetic and health effects. Release of iron from unlined iron pipes can result in customer reports of &quot;red water&quot; at the tap. Release of copper from copper pipes can result in customer reports of &quot;blue water&quot; and/or a metallic taste. Release of lead can occur from the solder used to join copper pipe together or from brass fixtures. Copper and lead levels at the consumer&#x27;s tap are regulated to protect consumer health.

Utilities will often adjust the chemistry of the water before distribution to minimize its corrosiveness. The simplest adjustment involves control of pH and alkalinity to produce a water that tends to passivate corrosion by depositing a layer of calcium carbonate. Corrosion inhibitors are often added to reduce release of metals into the water. Common corrosion inhibitors added to the water are phosphates and silicates.

Maintenance of a biologically safe drinking water is another goal in water distribution. Typically, a chlorine based disinfectant, such as sodium hypochlorite or monochloramine is added to the water as it leaves the treatment plant. Booster stations can be placed within the distribution system to ensure that all areas of the distribution system have adequate sustained levels of disinfection.

===Topologies===
Like electric power lines, roads, and microwave radio networks, water systems may have a loop or branch network topology, or a combination of both. The piping networks are circular or rectangular. If any one section of water distribution main fails or needs repair, that section can be isolated without disrupting all users on the network.

Most systems are divided into zones. Factors determining the extent or size of a zone can include hydraulics, telemetry systems, history, and population density. Sometimes systems are designed for a specific area then are modified to accommodate development. Terrain affects hydraulics and some forms of telemetry. While each zone may operate as a stand-alone system, there is usually some arrangement to interconnect zones in order to manage equipment failures or system failures.

==Water network maintenance==
Water supply networks usually represent the majority of assets of a water utility. Systematic documentation of maintenance works using a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) is a key to a successful operation of a water utility.

==Sustainable urban water supply==

A sustainable urban water supply network covers all the activities related to provision of potable water. Sustainable development is of increasing importance for the water supply to urban areas. Incorporating innovative water technologies into water supply systems improves water supply from sustainable perspectives. The development of innovative water technologies provides flexibility to the water supply system, generating a fundamental and effective means of sustainability based on an integrated real options approach.

Water is an essential natural resource for human existence. It is needed in every industrial and natural process, for example, it is used for oil refining, for liquid-liquid extraction in hydro-metallurgical processes, for cooling, for scrubbing in the iron and the steel industry, and for several operations in food processing facilities.

It is necessary to adopt a new approach to design urban water supply networks; water shortages are expected in the forthcoming decades and environmental regulations for water utilization and waste-water disposal are increasingly stringent.

To achieve a sustainable water supply network, new sources of water are needed to be developed, and to reduce environmental pollution.

The price of water is increasing, so less water must be wasted and actions must be taken to prevent pipeline leakage. Shutting down the supply service to fix leaks is less and less tolerated by consumers. A sustainable water supply network must monitor the freshwater consumption rate and the waste-water generation rate.

Many of the urban water supply networks in developing countries face problems related to population increase, water scarcity, and environmental pollution.

===Population growth===
In 1900 just 13% of the global population lived in cities. By 2005, 49% of the global population lived in urban areas. In 2030 it is predicted that this statistic will rise to 60%. Attempts to expand water supply by governments are costly and often not sufficient. The building of new illegal settlements makes it hard to map, and make connections to, the water supply, and leads to inadequate water management. In 2002, there were 158 million people with inadequate water supply. An increasing number of people live in slums, in inadequate sanitary conditions, and are therefore at risk of disease.

===Water scarcity===
Potable water is not well distributed in the world. 1.8 million deaths are attributed to unsafe water supplies every year, according to the WHO. Many people do not have any access, or do not have access to quality and quantity of potable water, though water itself is abundant. Poor people in developing countries can be close to major rivers, or be in high rainfall areas, yet not have access to potable water at all. There are also people living where lack of water creates millions of deaths every year.

Where the water supply system cannot reach the slums, people manage to use hand pumps, to reach the pit wells, rivers, canals, swamps and any other source of water. In most cases the water quality is unfit for human consumption. The principal cause of water scarcity is the growth in demand. Water is taken from remote areas to satisfy the needs of urban areas. Another reason for water scarcity is climate change: precipitation patterns have changed; rivers have decreased their flow; lakes are drying up; and aquifers are being emptied.

===Governmental issues===
In developing countries many governments are corrupt and poor and they respond to these problems with frequently changing policies and non clear agreements. Water demand exceeds supply, and household and industrial water supplies are prioritised over other uses, which leads to water stress. Potable water has a price in the market; water often becomes a business for private companies, which earn a profit by putting a higher price on water, which imposes a barrier for lower-income people. The Millennium Development Goals propose the changes required.

Goal 6 of the United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goals is to &quot;Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all&quot;. This is in recognition of the human right to water and sanitation, which was formally acknowledged at the United Nations General Assembly in 2010, that &quot;clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the recognition of all human rights&quot;. Sustainable water supply includes ensuring availability, accessibility, affordability and quality of water for all individuals.

In advanced economies, the problems are about optimising existing supply networks. These economies have usually had continuing evolution, which allowed them to construct infrastructure to supply water to people. The European Union has developed a set of rules and policies to overcome expected future problems.

There are many international documents with interesting, but not very specific, ideas and therefore they are not put into practice. Recommendations have been made by the United Nations, such as the Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development.

== Optimizing the water supply network ==
The yield of a system can be measured by either its value or its net benefit. For a water supply system, the true value or the net benefit is a reliable water supply service having adequate quantity and good quality of the product. For example, if the existing water supply of a city needs to be extended to supply a new municipality, the impact of the new branch of the system must be designed to supply the new needs, while maintaining supply to the old system.

===Single-objective optimization===
The design of a system is governed by multiple criteria, one being cost. If the benefit is &quot;fixed&quot;, the least cost design results in maximum benefit. However, the least cost approach normally results in a &quot;minimum capacity&quot; for a water supply network. A minimum cost model usually searches for the least cost solution (in pipe sizes), while satisfying the hydraulic constraints such as: required output pressures, maximum pipe flow rate and pipe flow velocities. The cost is a function of pipe diameters; therefore the optimization problem consists of finding a minimum cost solution by optimising pipe sizes to provide the minimum acceptable capacity.

===Multi-objective optimization===
However, according to the authors of the paper entitled, “Method for optimizing design and rehabilitation of water distribution systems”, “the least capacity is not a desirable solution to a sustainable water supply network in a long term, due to the uncertainty of the future demand”. It is preferable to provide extra pipe capacity to cope with unexpected demand growth and with water outages. The problem changes from a single objective optimization problem (minimizing cost), to a multi-objective optimization problem (minimizing cost and maximizing flow capacity).

===Weighted sum method===
To solve a multi-objective optimization problem, it is necessary to convert the problem into a single objective optimization problem, by using adjustments, such as a weighted sum of objectives, or an ε-constraint method. The weighted sum approach gives a certain weight to the different objectives, and then factors in all these weights to form a single objective function that can be solved by single factor optimization. This method is not entirely satisfactory, because the weights cannot be correctly chosen, so this approach cannot find the optimal solution for all the original objectives.

===The constraint method===
The second approach (the constraint method), chooses one of the objective functions as the single objective, and the other objective functions are treated as constraints with a limited value. However, the optimal solution depends on the pre-defined constraint limits.

=== Sensitivity analysis ===
The multiple objective optimization problems involve computing the tradeoff between the costs and benefits resulting in a set of solutions that can be used for sensitivity analysis and tested in different scenarios. But there is no single optimal solution that will satisfy the global optimality of both objectives. As both objectives are to some extent contradictory, it is not possible to improve one objective without sacrificing the other. It is necessary in some cases use a different approach. (e.g. Pareto Analysis), and choose the best combination.

=== Operational constraints ===
Returning to the cost objective function, it cannot violate any of the operational constraints. Generally this cost is dominated by the energy cost for pumping. “The operational constraints include the standards of customer service, such as: the minimum delivered pressure, in addition to the physical constraints such as the maximum and the minimum water levels in storage tanks to prevent overtopping and emptying respectively.”

In order to optimize the operational performance of the water supply network, at the same time as minimizing the energy costs, it is necessary to predict the consequences of different pump and valve settings on the behavior of the network.

Apart from Linear and Non-linear Programming, there are other methods and approaches to design, to manage and operate a water supply network to achieve sustainability—for instance, the adoption of appropriate technology coupled with effective strategies for operation and maintenance. These strategies must include effective management models, technical support to the householders and industries, sustainable financing mechanisms, and development of reliable supply chains. All these measures must ensure the following: system working lifespan; maintenance cycle; continuity of functioning; down time for repairs; water yield and water quality.

== Sustainable development ==
In an unsustainable system there is insufficient maintenance of the water networks, especially in the major pipe lines in urban areas. The system deteriorates and then needs rehabilitation or renewal.
Householders and sewage treatment plants can both make the water supply networks more efficient and sustainable. Major improvements in eco-efficiency are gained through systematic separation of rainfall and wastewater. Membrane technology can be used for recycling wastewater.

The municipal government can develop a “Municipal Water Reuse System” which is a current approach to manage the rainwater. It applies a water reuse scheme for treated wastewater, on a municipal scale, to provide non-potable water for industry, household and municipal uses. This technology consists in separating the urine fraction of sanitary wastewater, and collecting it for recycling its nutrients. The feces and graywater fraction is collected, together with organic wastes from the households, using a gravity sewer system, continuously flushed with non-potable water. The water is treated anaerobically and the biogas is used for energy production.

One effective way to achieve sustainable water management is to shift emphasis towards decentralized water projects, such as drip irrigation diffusion in India. This project covers large spatial areas while relying on individual technological adoption decisions, offering scalable solutions that can mitigate water scarcity and enhance agricultural productivity.

Another method that can be utilized is through the promoting of community engagement and resistance against unsustainable water infrastructure projects. Grassroots movements, as observed in anti-dam protests in various countries, play a crucial role in challenging dominant development narratives and advocating for more socially and ecologically just water management practices.

Municipalities and other forms of local governments should also invest in innovative technologies, such as membrane technology for wastewater recycling, and develop policy frameworks that incentivize eco-efficient practices. Municipal water reuse systems, as demonstrated in implementation, offer promising avenues for integrating wastewater treatment and resource recovery into urban water networks.

The sustainable water supply system is an integrated system including water intake, water utilization, wastewater discharge and treatment and water environmental protection. It requires reducing freshwater and groundwater usage in all sectors of consumption. Developing sustainable water supply systems is a growing trend, because it serves people&#x27;s long-term interests. There are several ways to reuse and recycle the water, in order to achieve long-term sustainability, such as:
* Gray water re-use and treatment: gray water is wastewater coming from baths, showers, sinks and washbasins. If this water is treated it can be used as a source of water for uses other than drinking. Depending on the type of gray water and its level of treatment, it can be re-used for irrigation and toilet flushing. According to an investigation about the impacts of domestic grey water reuse on public health, carried out by the New South Wales Health Centre in Australia in the year 2000, grey water contains less nitrogen and fecal pathogenic organisms than sewage, and the organic content of grey water decomposes more rapidly.
* Ecological treatment systems use little energy: there are many applications in gray water re-use, such as reed beds, soil treatment systems and plant filters. This process is ideal for gray water re-use, because of easier maintenance and higher removal rates of organic matter, ammonia, nitrogen and phosphorus.

Other possible approaches to scoping models for water supply, applicable to any urban area, include the following:
* Sustainable drainage system
* Borehole extraction
* Intercluster groundwater flow
* Canal and river extraction
* Aquifer storage
* A more user-friendly indoor water use

The Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development is a good example of the new trend to overcome water supply problems. This statement, suggested by advanced economies, has come up with some principles that are of great significance to urban water supply. These are:
# Fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain life, development and the environment.
# Water development and management should be based on a participatory approach, involving users, planners and policy-makers at all levels.
# Women play a central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of water. Institutional arrangements should reflect the role of women in water provision and protection.
# Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic good.

From these statements, developed in 1992, several policies have been created to give importance to water and to move urban water system management towards sustainable development. The Water Framework Directive by the European Commission is a good example of what has been created there out of former policies.

== Future approaches ==
There is great need for a more sustainable water supply systems. To achieve sustainability several factors must be tackled at the same time: climate change, rising energy cost, and rising populations. All of these factors provoke change and put pressure on management of available water resources.

An obstacle to transforming conventional water supply systems is the amount of time needed to achieve the transformation. More specifically, transformation must be implemented by municipal legislation bodies, which always need short-term solutions too. Another obstacle to achieving sustainability in water supply systems is the insufficient practical experience with the technologies required, and the missing know-how about the organization and the transition process.

Urban water infrastructure faces several challenges that undermine its sustainability and resilience. One critical issue highlighted in recent research is the vulnerability of water networks to climate variability and extreme weather events. Poor seasonal rains, as observed in the case of the Panama Canal&#x27;s lock and dam infrastructure, exemplify how inadequate water supply can strain water-intensive infrastructure, raising questions about engineering legitimacy and the reliability of water systems.

Another key challenge is the unequal development associated with large-scale water infrastructure projects such as dams and canals. Such projects, while aimed at promoting economic growth, often actually reproduce social and economic inequalities by displacing rural communities and marginalizing indigenous populations. This phenomenon of &quot;accumulation by dispossession&quot; further emphasizes the need for more equitable and inclusive approaches to water infrastructure development.

Possible ways to improve this situation is simulating of the network, implementing pilot projects, learning from the costs involved and the benefits achieved.

<text>FutureGen was a project to demonstrate capture and sequestration of waste carbon dioxide from a coal-fired electrical generating station. The project (renamed FutureGen 2.0) was retrofitting a shuttered coal-fired power plant in Meredosia, Illinois, with oxy-combustion generators. The waste CO2 would be piped approximately to be sequestered in underground saline formations. FutureGen was a partnership between the United States government and an alliance of primarily coal-related corporations. Costs were estimated at US$1.65 billion, with $1.0 billion provided by the Federal Government.

First announced by President George W. Bush in 2003, construction started in 2014 after restructuring, canceling, relocating, and restarting. Citing an inability to commit and spend the funds by deadlines in 2015, the Department of Energy withdrew funds and suspended FutureGen 2.0 in February, 2015. The government also cited the Alliance&#x27;s inability to raise the requisite amount of private funding. The Meredosia power plant that had been planned for retrofit was demolished around 2021.

FutureGen 2.0 would have been the most comprehensive Department of Energy Carbon Capture and Storage demonstration project, involving all phases from combustion to sequestration. FutureGen&#x27;s initial plan involved integrated gasification combined cycle technology to produce both electricity and hydrogen. Early in the project it was to be sited in Mattoon, IL.

==Original project==
The original incarnation of FutureGen was as a public-private partnership to build the world&#x27;s first near zero-emissions coal-fueled power plant. The 275-megawatt plant would be intended to prove the feasibility of producing electricity and hydrogen from coal while capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide underground. The Alliance intended to build the plant in Mattoon Township, Coles County, Illinois northwest of Mattoon, Illinois, subject to necessary approvals (issuing a “Record of Decision”) by the Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process.

FutureGen was to be designed, developed and operated by the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, a non-profit consortium of coal mining and electric utility companies formed to partner with the DOE on the FutureGen project. The project was still in the development stage when its funding was cancelled in January 2008. The Alliance decision of the location of the host site, subject to DOE&#x27;s completing NEPA environmental reviews, was announced in December 2007 after a two-year bidding and review process. Construction was scheduled to begin in 2009, with full-scale plant operations to begin in 2012.

The estimated gross project cost, including construction and operations, and excluding offsetting revenue, was $1.65 billion. The project was governed by a legally binding cooperative agreement between DOE and the Alliance. Under the agreement, DOE was to provide 74% of the project’s cost, with private industry contributing the other 26%. The DOE also planned to solicit the financial support and participation of international governments in the FutureGen project, since by 2020 more than 60% of man-made greenhouse gas emissions are expected to come from developing countries. Foreign financial support was to offset a portion of DOE’s cost-share. As of January 2008, the foreign governments of China, India, Australia, South Korea, and Japan had expressed interest in participating and sharing the cost of the project.

FutureGen was to sequester carbon dioxide emissions at a rate of one million metric tons per year for four years, which is the scale a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) report cites as appropriate for proving sequestration. The MIT report also states that “the priority objective with respect to coal should be the successful large-scale demonstration of the technical, economic, and environmental performance of the technologies that make up all of the major components of a large-scale integrated CCS system — capture, transportation and storage.” An injection field test similar to this was done in Norway.

In March 2009 Washington Post reported that U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu expressed support for continuing the project using stimulus funds (after some changes that have not yet been specified) and making it a part of a larger portfolio of research plants developed in collaboration with other countries.

Following the successful completion of the first phase, in February 2013, the Energy Department announced the beginning of Phase II of the project development with a new cooperative agreement between the FutureGen Industrial Alliance and the Department of Energy. This means that the FutureGen project has government support as it moves into its third phase, deployment of the project.

===Site selection===
Site selection for the FutureGen facility was based on a competitive process which began in May 2006. Seven states responded to the Site Request for Proposals with a total of 12 proposals. Proposals were reviewed against a set of environmental, technical, regulatory, and financial criteria with input from external technical advisors on power plant design and carbon sequestration. In July 2006, four candidate sites were selected for further review, including an environmental impact analysis as required by NEPA.

DOE issued its Final Environmental impact statement (EIS) on November 8, 2007, which concluded that all four sites were acceptable from an environmental impact standpoint and all would move forward in the site evaluation process. EPA published a Notice of Availability (NOA) for the EIS in the Federal Register on November 16, 2007. The DOE is required by federal law to wait at least 30 days after the NOA release before issuing its final Record of Decision (ROD). The waiting period legally closed on December 17, 2007. DOE chose not to issue the ROD and advised the FutureGen Alliance to delay the final site selection announcement, which was scheduled to occur at the end of the 30-day waiting period. The Alliance chose to move ahead with the announcement, citing time, money, and a commitment to proposers to select the final site by year-end. &quot;Every month of delay can add $10 million to the project&#x27;s cost, solely due to inflation,&quot; said Michael Mudd, the Alliance&#x27;s chief executive.
The Michael Mudd, the CEO of the FutureGen Alliance, announced the selection of Mattoon, Illinois as the host site on December 18, 2007. According to the EIS, Mattoon, IL the site is located about northwest of downtown Mattoon in the eastern part of Mattoon township section 8 on of former farm land. The carbon sequestration area is about below the ground. In July 2007, Illinois Public Act 095-0018 became law giving the state of Illinois ownership of and liability for the sequestered gases.

===Technology===
Original FutureGen project was intended to combine and test several new technologies in a single location, including coal gasification, emissions controls, hydrogen production, electricity generation, and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS).

Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) was the core technology behind FutureGen. IGCC power plants use two turbines – a gas and a steam turbine – to produce electric power more efficiently than pulverized coal plants. IGCC plants also make it easier to capture carbon dioxide for carbon sequestration.

FutureGen was to capture carbon dioxide produced during the gasification process and pump it into deep rock formations thousands of feet under ground. FutureGen specifically targeted rock formations containing saline water, as these are one of the most abundant types of geologic formations that can be used to store carbon dioxide worldwide. A study by the Global Energy Technology Strategy Program estimates the storage capacity of these saline rock formations in the U.S. to be 2,970 gigatons of carbon dioxide, compared to a capacity of 77 gigatons of carbon dioxide for all other types of reservoirs, such as depleted gas fields. Focusing on rock formations with saline water was intended to help ensure that the lessons learned from the project are broadly transferable throughout the U.S. and around the world.

===Challenges===
Maintaining the project schedule and keeping costs down were two major challenges with which the DOE and the FutureGen Alliance grappled. The project had remained on schedule with the announcement of the host site before the end of 2007; however, a desire by DOE to restructure the project’s financial arrangement has brought the project to a halt.

In December 2007, the DOE Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy James Slutz stated that projected cost overruns for the project &quot;require a reassessment of FutureGen&#x27;s design.&quot; And that &quot;This will require restructuring FutureGen to maximize the role of private-sector innovation, facilitate the most productive public-private partnership, and prevent further cost escalation.&quot;

The FutureGen Alliance wrote a letter to the Department of Energy’s Under Secretary C.H. “Bud” Albright Jr. stating that overall inflation and the rising cost of raw materials and engineering services are driving costs up on energy projects around the world. According to James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, the market for steel, concrete and power plant components has “just gone through the roof globally”, and much of the reason is the construction of hundreds of new conventional coal plants.

On January 11, 2008, the FutureGen Alliance sent a letter to the DOE offering to lower the government&#x27;s portion of the project&#x27;s costs. The initial plans had called for DOE to pay based on a percentage of the total cost, and their portion had risen from about $620 million to about $1.33 billion. The letter indicated that DOE&#x27;s portion would now be $800 million.

Risk management was a significant portion of the cost of the first FutureGen experimental implementation. FutureGen involved many complex never-before-solved technology problems. The risks also included significant health risks, if the untested-technology systems failed to work correctly.

===Funding cancellation===
On January 29, 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy announced that it would pull its funding for the project, mostly due to higher than expected costs. The move is likely to delay the project as other members seek the additional funds that the DOE was to provide. The sudden concern over cost after an Illinois site was chosen over those in Texas raised questions about the motives for the cancellation. Local and state officials in Illinois, including then Governor Rod Blagojevich, expressed frustration at the move, especially in light of the money and resources that the state had spent to attract the project. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois accused Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman of &quot;cruel deception&quot; of Illinoisans by &quot;creating false hope in a FutureGen project which he has no intention of funding or supporting.&quot; Durbin claimed that &quot;when the city of Mattoon, Illinois, was chosen over possible locations in Texas, the secretary of energy set out to kill FutureGen.&quot; Mattoon mayor David Cline said &quot;one could question the motivation of the Department of Energy which was ready to move forward with the project until a site other than Texas was chosen.&quot;

In March 2009, Congressional auditors determined that the DOE had miscalculated the government portion of the project&#x27;s cost, overstating the amount by a half billion dollars. As a result, the Bush administration cited the project as having nearly doubled in cost when, in reality, it had increased by 39%

Secretary Bodman stated that with restructuring the FutureGen project, DOE plans &quot;to equip multiple new clean-coal power plants with advanced CCS technology, instead of one demonstration plant. That will provide more electricity from multiple clean-coal plants, sequestering at least twice as much CO2 and providing for wider use and more rapid commercialization.&quot;

==Revised plan FutureGen 2.0==

===Plans for continuing FutureGen===
Despite the cancellation of funding by the DOE, the FutureGen Alliance continued to move forward with the project, opening an office in Mattoon and planning to buy the land for the plant in August 2008, in partnership with a local group.

During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaigns, Sen. Barack Obama pledged his support to clean coal technologies, with plans to develop five commercial-scale coal plants equipped with CCS technology.

In November 2008, Fred Palmer, senior vice president at Peabody Energy shared his outlook on FutureGen with the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), saying that the FutureGen Alliance would &quot;Make a concerted effort in the Obama administration to reinstate the project and get this built as originally planned.&quot;

On June 12, 2009, the DOE announced a restart of design work for the FutureGen project. &quot;Following the completion of the detailed cost estimate and fundraising activities,&quot; the press release states, &quot;the Department of Energy and the FutureGen Alliance will make a decision either to move forward or to discontinue the project early in 2010.&quot;

===Revised project: FutureGen 2.0===
On August 5, 2010, the DOE announced a retooling of the FutureGen project, dubbed FutureGen 2.0. The revised plan includes retrofitting a shuttered coal-fired power plant in Meredosia, Illinois to demonstrate advanced oxy-combustion technology, and piping the carbon dioxide 175 miles to Mattoon for underground storage. Due to these changes, leaders in Mattoon decided to drop out of the FutureGen project.

The Illinois sites vying for the underground storage portion of the project were in Christian, Douglas, Fayette, and Morgan counties, after sites in Adams and Pike counties were cut in December 2010. In February 2011, Morgan County was chosen for the sequestration site.

In Sept, 2014 FutureGen received the first-ever EPA permits for four class VI carbon dioxide sequestration wells in Morgan County, with plans to store 1.1 million metric tons per year for 20 years.
Also in 2014 FutureGen survived a lawsuit from Illinois Electric utility ComEd, which challenged the state&#x27;s ability to impose a surcharge on all customers to pay for FutureGen electricity.

According to critics, including the Illinois Policy Institute, the plan presents major environmental and fiscal pitfalls.

===FutureGen 2.0 funding cancellation===
The Department of Energy ordered suspension of FutureGen 2.0 in February, 2015. The funds, appropriated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, needed to be committed by July 1 and spent by Sept 30, 2015. The government also cited the Alliance&#x27;s inability to raise the requisite amount of private funding. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz explained at a press conference “If you look between now and July 1, without them having closed their financing, and try as we might, we just don’t see how it gets over the finish line.” At the time of suspension the power plant part of the project had spent $116.5 million and the sequestration part had spent $86 million.

==Alliance members==
The FutureGen Industrial Alliance is a consortium of 10 power producers and electric utilities from around the globe.

===Former members===
Four companies initially a part of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance have since dropped out of the project.

== A simple well water control system ==

Referring to the figure on the left, a submersible water pump is installed in a well. The pressure switch turns the water pump on when it senses a pressure that is less than &quot;P&quot;lo and turns it off when it senses a pressure greater than &quot;P&quot;hi. While the pump is on, the pressure tank fills up. The pressure tank is then depleted as it supplies water in the specified pressure range to prevent &quot;short-cycling&quot;, in which the pump tries to establish the proper pressure by rapidly cycling between &quot;P&quot;lo and &quot;P&quot;hi.

A simple pressure tank would be just a tank which held water with an air space above the water which would compress as more water entered the tank. Modern systems isolate the water from the pressurized air using a flexible rubber or plastic diaphragm or bladder, because otherwise the air will dissolve in the water and be removed from the tank by usage. Eventually there will be little or no air and the tank will become &quot;waterlogged&quot; causing short-cycling, and will need to be drained to restore operation. The diaphragm or bladder may itself exert a pressure on the water, but it is usually small and will be neglected in the following discussion.

Referring to the diagram on the right, a pressure tank is generally pressurized when empty with a &quot;charging pressure&quot; &quot;P&quot;c, which is usually about 2 psi below the turn-on pressure &quot;P&quot;lo (Case 1). The total volume of the tank is &quot;V&quot;t. When in use, the air in the tank will be compressed to pressure &quot;P&quot; and there will be a volume &quot;V&quot; of water in the tank (Case 2). In the following development, all pressures are gauge pressures, which are the pressures above atmospheric pressure (&quot;P&quot;a, which is altitude dependent). The ideal gas law may be written for both cases, and the amount of air in each case is equal:
: formula_1
: formula_2
where &quot;N&quot; is the number of molecules of gas (equal in both cases), &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant and &quot;T&quot; is the temperature. Assuming that the temperature is equal for both cases, the above equations can be solved for the water pressure/volume relationship in the tank:
: formula_3
: formula_4

Tanks are generally specified by their total volume &quot;V&quot;t and the &quot;drawdown&quot; (Δ&quot;V&quot;), which is the amount of water the tank will eject as the tank pressure goes from &quot;P&quot;hi to &quot;P&quot;lo, which are established by the pressure switch:
: formula_5

The reason for the charging pressure can now be seen: The larger the charging pressure, the larger the drawdown. However, a charging pressure above &quot;P&quot;lo will not allow the pump to turn on when the water pressure is below &quot;P&quot;lo, so it is kept a bit below &quot;P&quot;lo. Another important parameter is the drawdown factor (&quot;f&quot;Δ&quot;V&quot;), which is the ratio of the drawdown to the total tank volume:
: formula_6

This factor is independent of the tank size so that the drawdown can be calculated for any tank, given its total volume, atmospheric pressure, charging pressure, and the limiting pressures established by the pressure switch.

<text>Hungry Mother State Park is a state park in southwestern Virginia.

Much of the land for Hungry Mother State Park was donated by local landowners to develop a new state park in Smyth County on Hungry Mother Creek. The park is one of the six original CCC parks that opened in June 1936. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

==Origins of name==
It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. A legend states that when the Native Americans destroyed several settlements on the New River south of the park, Molly Marley and her small child were among the survivors taken to the raiders’ base north of the park. They eventually escaped, wandering through the wilderness eating berries. Molly finally collapsed, and her child wandered down a creek. Upon finding help, the only words the child could utter were &quot;Hungry Mother.&quot; When the search party arrived at the foot of the mountain where Molly had collapsed, they found the child&#x27;s mother dead. Today, that mountain is Molly&#x27;s Knob (3,270 feet), and the stream is Hungry Mother Creek.

<doc id="1249175" wikidata="Q284846" url="?curid=1249175" title="Schalk Burger">
<text>Schalk Willem Petrus Burger Jr. (born 13 April 1983) is a South African former professional rugby union player. He played as a flanker for Saracens in the English Premiership and won 86 caps for South Africa.

He was a member of the 2007 Rugby World Cup-winning team, was twice named South African Rugby Player of the Year (in 2004 and 2011), and was named IRB Player of the Year in 2004, among other accolades. He also holds the record for the most appearances (84) and most tries scored (13) by a Springbok flanker. However, Burger&#x27;s physical approach also resulted in him being shown a yellow card six times in international rugby, second only to Italy&#x27;s Marco Bortolami (7 times) as of June 2014. Burger also suffered injuries, especially to his neck and knee, which sidelined him for considerable periods at a time. He also played four times for the Barbarians.

==Early life==
Burger is one of a handful of second-generation Springboks. His father, also called Schalk Burger, was an international lock, being capped for South Africa during the &quot;isolation years&quot; of the 1980s. Burger attended high school at Paarl Gimnasium, along with future teammate and Springbok captain Jean de Villiers, and enjoyed success in many sports. Burger attended Stellenbosch University and stayed in Eendrag Men&#x27;s Residence before leaving in order to pursue a full-time rugby career.

==Rugby career==
After playing for the Under 21 Springbok side that won the U21 Rugby World Cup in 2002 and then captaining it in 2003, Burger was selected for the senior Springbok squad. He made his debut against Georgia in 2003 at the Rugby World Cup and carved out a name as one of the best flankers in the world with solid performances in the Super 12, Tri-Nations and Currie Cup.

===2004===
In 2004, Burger was selected as part of a rejuvenated Springbok squad which, under the guiding hand of new coach Jake White, went on to win the Tri-Nations trophy for the first time since Nick Mallett&#x27;s team managed the feat in 1998.

To cap off a magnificent year, Burger was also awarded the most prestigious rugby player&#x27;s award, the IRB International Player of the Year award in the 2004 season. In addition, he claimed the 2004 ABSA SA Rugby Player of the Year award.

===2006===

After an indifferent 2006 Super 14 season, during which Burger showed only flashes of the brilliance that took him to the peak of world rugby, he was to once again start in his favoured number 6 shirt ( openside flanker in South African rugby) in the national team for the upcoming expanded Tri-Nations test series against Australia and New Zealand. However, in the Springboks&#x27; Test match against Scotland on 17 June, Burger suffered a serious neck injury. The following day, it was confirmed that he would require cervical fusion surgery and would be out of action for at least the remainder of 2006. The injury and the required surgery were serious enough for White to tell the media, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to jump to conclusions – but there is a chance he may never play again.&quot; Burger&#x27;s father told a Cape Town radio program that the injury was between his sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, adding, &quot;Although the operation is difficult the fact that the injury is lower down his neck is good for a future prognosis of making a full recovery.&quot; The South African Rugby Union released a statement on 24 June, the date of the surgery, indicating that the surgery was successful and that Burger would undergo six to eight months of rehabilitation, with plans to return him to the game.

===2007 – Rugby World Cup Champion===

Following successful surgery and rehabilitation, Burger returned to the Vodacom Stormers line-up on 13 January 2007, playing 55 minutes as the Stormers lost to the Bulls. Despite the loss, Burger did show flashes of the brilliance that took him to the peak of world rugby in 2004–05. After a shaky start to the 2007 Super 14 season, Burger inspired the Stormers to their first win of the campaign against the Chiefs as the Stormers recorded their first points of the season in a tense 21–16 victory at the Newlands Stadium.

In mid-2007 he was picked in the Springboks squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He was linked with a move to Harlequins of the English Premiership after the cup.

During the Springboks&#x27; first match of the Rugby World Cup against Samoa, Burger was cited for a high tackle on Junior Polu, and on 11 September was given a four-match suspension which would have in theory kept him out of the team until the semi-final. However, this was reduced to a two-match suspension on appeal.

Burger would return to play a key role in South Africa&#x27;s World Cup triumph as the Springboks defeated England 15–6 to lift the Webb Ellis trophy for the second time in four attempts.

===2008===
In March 2008, Burger was banned for openly abusing a touch judge in a Super 14 game for the Stormers against the Sharks in Durban. The touch judge in question had suggested the referee send Burger to the sin-bin for an offense that the referee hadn&#x27;t seen. Upon leaving the field, Burger was seen to be gesticulating and shouting at the touch judge. The citing commissioner decided that Burger be banned for two weeks for his actions. After another great season which saw the Stormers finish just short of making the play-offs, Burger was selected by new coach Peter de Villiers for the Springboks&#x27; 2008 Tri Nations campaign.

===2009===
Burger was selected for the Springboks&#x27; to play the British &amp; Irish Lions, not having played since injuring his calf muscle in April while playing for the Stormers.

During the opening minute of the second British &amp; Irish Lions test at Loftus Versfeld, Pretoria, Burger made contact with the eyes of Lions winger Luke Fitzgerald. The incident was seen by touch judge Bryce Lawrence who reported it to match referee Christophe Berdos, who awarded a yellow card. Burger was subsequently cited by the commissioning officer for &quot;making contact with the eye area&quot; and then handed an eight-week ban. A later investigation by judicial officer Alan Hudson concluded that contact with the face was made but there was no intention to gouge Fitzgerald&#x27;s eyes, but that Burger acted &quot;contrary to good sportsmanship by making contact with the face in the eye area.&quot; Burger responded by saying &quot;...I only have the utmost respect for the traditions of the wonderful game of rugby. Through my life and career I have always approached the game with the intention only of playing it hard and fair. I am not a rugby thug and will never intentionally engage in eye gouging or similar illegal actions.&quot;

===2010===
Burger was selected for the 2010 Tri Nations series as part of the South African squad to play six matches. The first game was against New Zealand on 10 July 2010 in Auckland. He started that match at blindside Flanker. South Africa lost that match 32–12. But in the second game against New Zealand which South Africa lost 31–17 Burger scored a try. He scored his second and final try of the tournament against New Zealand.
During the 2010 Currie Cup final, which lost to the Sharks 30–10, Burger suffered a broken rib. However, he was not substituted during the match, and also scored Western Province&#x27;s only try. Scans after the game revealed the injury, which would force Burger to miss the 2010 end-of-year rugby union tests against the Home Unions.

===2011 – Rugby World Cup===
Burger was selected for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. He played the first game against Wales which South Africa won 17–16. He played all the matches in group D. South Africa were knocked out however in the Quarter Finals against Australia. He was ruled out of South Africa&#x27;s Summer tour of England with injury. In November at the end-of-year awards ceremony in Johannesburg, Burger was named the SARU&#x27;s Player of the Year for the second time, becoming the fifth Springbok to win the award more than once.

===2012–13===
Over the following two seasons, Burger struggled with injury and illness.
During preparations for the 2013 Super Rugby season, Burger pulled up during a running exercise after experiencing spasms in his left calf. A back scan revealed a cyst next to his spinal cord impacting the nerve which influenced the calf muscle&#x27;s performance, and he underwent an operation to drain the cyst and relieve pressure on the nerve. It was thought at the time that Burger would miss at least the first three weeks of the season.
However, severe complications followed. During the initial operation, Burger contracted a hospital bug, which resulted in bacterial meningitis. At one stage during the isolation period, Burger&#x27;s condition became so serious that there were genuine fears for his life. After his situation had improved, he then had to endure a series of operations to remove the cyst completely. In total, Burger would spend six weeks in hospital and a further eight weeks recovering indoors. Burger resumed training at the end of July, but was reluctant to set a definite return date:
To give a timeline is quite difficult... I certainly don&#x27;t want to over-commit. The good news is that I can start to train properly and get the heart-rate up. That, in itself, is exciting news and I look forward to increasing my training schedule over the next few weeks with the help of the strength and conditioning team at WP Rugby. We will then reassess things again in a month&#x27;s time.
Burger finally returned to action in late September, coming off the bench for the final 20 minutes of the Currie Cup match between Western Province and Free State Cheetahs in Bloemfontein. Although it was not a spectacular comeback, he emerged unscathed as Western Province came from behind to win 29–27. It was Burger&#x27;s first competitive appearance since injuring his knee 18 months earlier.

===2014===
On 24 May, during the Stormers&#x27; 33–0 win over the Cheetahs, Burger suffered a neck injury. The injury was not serious, but he failed to recover in time for the following match against the Sharks in Durban.
On 2 June, it was announced that Burger had signed a two-year contract with Japanese Top League side Suntory Sungoliath. As part of his contract, he would still be available to play for the and the national side, but would not feature during the 2014 Currie Cup.
For the 2014 June test series against Wales and Scotland, Springbok coach Heyneke Meyer named Burger and Victor Matfield in the squad of 36 players. Both had not played for South Africa since the 2011 World Cup.

===2015 – Rugby World Cup Bronze Medalist===
Due to his success in returning to the Springboks after recovering from spinal meningitis, he was awarded the Comeback of the Year Award at the Laureus World Sports Awards. He joined the list of Super Rugby centurions during their Round 7 match against the in Dunedin, starting the match which ended in a 21–39 defeat for the Stormers. Selected as part of the Springbok squad at the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Schalk started in all seven matches, the majority as openside flanker, with a sole appearance as number eight in their Pool B match against Japan. The Springboks reached the semi-finals, bowing out to eventual champions New Zealand (18–20), before clinching the Bronze Final against Argentina (24–13). Burger scored tries against Samoa and Scotland in the pool stages, and assisted Fourie du Preez&#x27;s try in their victory against Wales (23–19) in the Quarter Finals. Schalk finished the tournament as the player with the equal second most RWC tournament participations (4), equal third most RWC matches won (16), as well as being the player with the equal second highest number of RWC matches contested (20), bested solely by Jason Leonard and Richie McCaw (22). Burger was also drawn into 2015 RWC sponsors Société Générale&#x27;s dream team, taking the position of openside flanker. Dismissing any notion of continuing to play for the Springboks in 2016 and beyond, Burger had suggested the commencement of his international retirement after the 2015 RWC Bronze Final.

===2016 – Saracens===
Burger signed a two-year deal to join English Premiership side Saracens prior to the 2016–2017 season. He helped Saracens win the European Champions Cup in 2017 and 2019, featuring in both finals. In December 2018 Burger announced that he would be leaving Saracens at the end of the 2018-2019 season to return to Cape Town.

==Personal life==

Burger is the eldest child of Schalk Burger Snr and his wife Myra. He has two younger siblings – brother Tiaan and sister René, who in 2008 gained international attention for speaking out after she was gang-raped.
When not playing rugby, Burger lives and works with his family on the Welbedacht Wine Estate near Wellington, Western Cape.

After dating for six years, Burger was engaged to Michele de Munck, an interior designer from Cape Town. They married at the Welbedacht Estate on 3 December 2011. The couple had their first child, Schalk Jr, in August 2012, and their second son Nicol was born in March 2014.

<doc id="1249182" wikidata="Q940448" url="?curid=1249182" title="Kevin Coyne">
<text>Kevin Coyne (27 January 1944 – 2 December 2004) was an English musician, singer, composer, film-maker, and a writer of lyrics, stories and poems. He was born in Derby, Derbyshire, England, and died in his adopted home of Nuremberg, Bavaria, Germany.

Coyne was critically acclaimed for his unorthodox style of blues-influenced guitar composition, the intense quality of his vocal delivery, and his lyrics describing injustice to the mentally ill. Musicians who have described themselves as Coyne fans include Sting and John Lydon. In the mid-1970s, prior to the formation of the Police, Coyne&#x27;s band included guitarist Andy Summers. BBC disc jockey Andy Kershaw described Coyne as &quot;a national treasure who keeps getting better&quot; and as one of the great British blues voices.

Over many years Coyne produced the art work for many of his own album covers. His move to Germany, in the 1980s, saw his work on full-size paintings blossom in its own right.

== Early days ==
As a teenager and young adult Coyne studied at the Joseph Wright School of Art from 1957 to 1961 and then studied graphics and painting at Derby School of Art from 1961 to 1965. There he met Nick Cudworth (piano, acoustic guitar). His love of American bluesmen developed, as did his song-craft and his guitar and vocal talents.

At the conclusion of his arts training, Coyne began the work that would change him forever – he spent the three years, from 1965 to 1968, working as a social therapist and psychiatric nurse at Whittingham Hospital near Preston in Lancashire and then for &quot;The Soho Project&quot; in London as a drugs counsellor During this period of working with the mentally ill he performed regularly. Subsequently, his musical aspirations took precedence and he signed a record deal in 1969.

Joined by Dave Clague (bass, acoustic guitar, ex-Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band), Coyne&#x27;s band got an early break as a result of a demo heard by John Peel, who in 1969 signed them to his Dandelion Records label. At first billed as Coyne-Clague (an early Dandelion release erroneously named them just &quot;Clague&quot;), the band soon altered its name to Siren. Reviewing the band&#x27;s 1971 LP &quot;Strange Locomotion&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981): &quot;Like Fleetwood Mac, this is British blues that neither chokes on false roots nor enmires itself in boogie reductionism. Kevin Coyne&#x27;s humorously belligerent drawl embodies the band&#x27;s wit and its punk chauvinism. Mistake: &#x27;Fetch Me My Woman,&#x27; which (second mistake) goes on for 7:40.&quot;

== An established artist ==
In 1973 he appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, performing &quot;I Want My Crown&quot; and &quot;House on the Hill&quot; with guitarist Gordon Smith and percussionist Chilli Charles. In 1975 Coyne and his band performed at the alternative festival held to protest against the Eurovision Song Contest 1975 in Stockholm; footage from the concert was later released as the 1976 film &quot;Musikfilmen&quot;.

In late 1975 and 1976 Coyne completed the musical &quot;England, England&quot;, written with playwright Snoo Wilson, and described as &quot;an evocation of the Kray twins&quot;. The musical, directed by Dusty Hughes, was performed in August 1977 at the Jeannetta Cochrane Theatre, in Holborn, London. It drew attention to the associations between fascism and the type of British nationalism that later saw the rise of the National Front and the election of Margaret Thatcher. From 18 August to 24 September 1977 it played at the Bush Theatre in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush.

In 1978 Coyne collaborated with fellow Derby Art School graduate Ian Breakwell to produce the film &quot;The Institution&quot; based on Breakwell&#x27;s Artist Placement Group work at Rampton Secure Hospital in Nottinghamshire.

Early in his career, Coyne turned down a meeting with founder of Elektra Records Jac Holzman (Coyne&#x27;s band Siren were on Elektra in America) to discuss replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors. &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the leather trousers!&quot; was Coynes&#x27; alleged reason.

Coyne&#x27;s first solo album, mainly with only his voice and guitar, was &quot;Case History&quot; (1972), released on Peel&#x27;s Dandelion label. It was not a success, but it was noticed by Virgin Records, which signed Coyne and released his 1973 album &quot;Marjory Razorblade&quot;. The single &quot;Marlene&quot; (b/w &quot;Everybody Says&quot;), taken from the album and released in August 1973, was the first Virgin single.

Coyne was the second artist signed to Virgin Records, after Mike Oldfield. Coyne got on well with label-mates such as John Lydon, who played &quot;Eastbourne Ladies&quot; on a Desert Island Discs–type show, and the Mekons, who recorded his &quot;Having a Party&quot;, an attack on Richard Branson. Described as being musically &quot;... a mixture of blues and music hall comedy, with a punk edge&quot;, the 1973 album contained many notable songs, such as &quot;Eastbourne Ladies&quot; and &quot;House on the Hill&quot; about life in a psychiatric institution. It was the record that established Coyne&#x27;s reputation.

In 1976 Coyne released the live album &quot;In Living Black and White&quot; that included Zoot Money, Andy Summers, Steve Thompson and Peter Woolf. Culled from three shows, it featured a cover of Dylan&#x27;s Knocking on Heaven&#x27;s Door. 
Released in 1979, the album &quot;Babble&quot;, by Coyne and singer Dagmar Krause, was subtitled Songs for Lonely Lovers, with Q Magazine noting that Coyne&#x27;s and Krause&#x27;s voices complement each other so well (...) the song function as a kind of exchange.&quot; 

The subsequent tour courted controversy when Coyne suggested, in the theatre presentation of the piece, that the destructive relationship between the two lovers could have been based on The Moors Murderers. Two performances at the Theatre Royal in Stratford, London were cancelled at short notice by Newham Council following negative press reports in &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. The show was eventually staged, for four nights, at the Oval House in Kennington. Reviewing the show for the &quot;NME&quot;, Paul Du Noyer wrote:

&quot;Babble&quot; is a particularly thorough, painstaking exploration of the reality of one relationship, stripped of romance and artifice. The format employed is correspondingly stark. Against a stage-set of light-bulb, table and chairs Coyne and his partner Dagmar Krause stand at either side; the only accompaniment comes from Bob Ward and Brian Godding, playing electric and acoustic guitar in the gloom behind.

American singer/songwriter Will Oldham claimed that the &quot;Babble&quot; album had &quot;changed my life&quot; and he recorded two of the songs himself. Oldham also went on to form a side project called The Babblers – who strictly played covers of songs from Babble. Extracts from a performance of &quot;Babble&quot;, in Berlin, were included in the short German film &quot;Herz Aus Feuer&quot; (1979) by Claudia Strauven and Wolfgang Kraesze.

The album &quot;Politicz&quot;, featuring Peter Kirtley on guitar and Steve Bull on keyboards, was released in 1982. AllMusic&#x27;s reviewer Dean McFarlane described the album as &quot;One of the British singer/songwriter&#x27;s more outwardly experimental records, this album contains some of his most intimate work, deeply personal songs and techniques which were taking him further and further away from tradition... strictly a post-punk album with a humorous political agenda&quot;. The same year Coyne appeared in concert with his band (Peter Kirtley (guitar), Steve Lamb (bass), Steve Bull (keyboards) and Dave Wilson(drums)) live in front of the Berlin Wall at the Tempodrom. The concert was later issued on the 2008 DVD &quot;At the Last Wall&quot; (Dockland Productions, Meyer Records).

== Nuremberg ==

Following a nervous breakdown and increasing difficulties with drink, Coyne left the UK in 1985. He settled in Nuremberg, West Germany and having given up alcohol, never stopped recording and touring, as well as writing books and exhibiting his paintings.

Coyne&#x27;s move to Germany saw his writing and painting career blossom. He published four books, two of which, &quot;Showbusiness&quot; and &quot;Party Dress&quot;, were published by Serpent&#x27;s Tail in London. There were numerous exhibitions of his visual work throughout Europe. Those in Berlin, Amsterdam and Zürich were well reviewed and attended.

In the late 1980s Coyne acted on stage, playing the small part of a rock star in &quot;Linie Eins&quot; (&quot;Line One&quot;), a German musical, at the Nuremberg Opera House. At the start of the 1990s Virgin began reissuing the albums on CD. This included a collection of Peel sessions from the period 1973 -1990. Q Magazine noted that &quot;the artistic focus of his albums is lost (...) the Peel Session is more fun&quot;.

His 1995 album, &quot;The Adventures of Crazy Frank&quot;, was based on a stage musical about English comedian Frank Randle, with Coyne in the title role. It also starred the singer Julia Kempken who was erroneously listed in &quot;The Guardian&quot; obituary as Coyne&#x27;s wife. Kempken later wrote fondly of this mistake, suggesting that her performance on stage as Randle&#x27;s wife had been so strong as to transform her, in the eyes of the press, into Coyne&#x27;s actual wife.

In Germany his sons from his first marriage, Eugene and Robert, appeared on recordings such as &quot;Tough And Sweet&quot; (1993) and &quot;Sugar Candy Taxi&quot; (1999), with guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Robert joining his band. His later German recordings, including &quot;Knocking on Your Brain&quot; (1997) often featured the &quot;Paradise Band&quot;. In later years he also collaborated with Brendan Croker on &quot;Life Is Almost Wonderful&quot;, with Jon Langford of the Mekons (on &quot;One Day in Chicago&quot;) and with Gary Lucas once of Captain Beefheart&#x27;s Magic Band (on &quot;Knocking on Your Brain&quot;). A reunion with original Siren members Dave Clague and Nick Cudworth happened for a John Peel&#x27;s Dandelion Records DVD, alongside solo performances by Coyne.

In a 2004 interview with Frank Bangay, Coyne named his favourite blues musicians as Robert Johnson, Leroy Carr, Peetie Wheatstraw and Tommy McClennan

== Death ==
Diagnosed with lung fibrosis in 2002, Coyne died at his home in Germany in 2004. He was survived by his wife Helmi and his sons Eugene, Robert and Nico.

Writing in his obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alan Clayson said, &quot;... Virgin&#x27;s press office referred to him as an &quot;anti-star&quot; ... If he meant nothing in the Top 40, Coyne was appreciated as a songwriter&#x27;s songwriter, and collaborated with musicians such as Zoot Money, Andy Summers, Carla Bley, Robert Wyatt... He earned, too, the admiration of Johnny Rotten and Sting. Coyne was infinitely less precious and artistically self-centred than other artists of that era, such as Nick Drake, Melanie Safka and James Taylor, whose primarily acoustic albums appealed more to self-doubting adolescent diarists than fans of heavy metal, jazz-rock and similar genres that dominated early 1970s rock.&quot;

==2007 tributes==
In 2007, the Nightingales recorded a version of &quot;Good Boy&quot; for their album &quot;Out of True&quot;, Jackie Leven recorded a song about Coyne on his album &quot;Oh What A Blow The Phantom Dealt Me!&quot;, and &quot;Here Come The Urban Ravens&quot; featured on the album, &quot;Whispers From The Offing – A Tribute to Kevin Coyne&quot;, put together by Coyne&#x27;s friend Frank Bangay.

The full track listing for the CD version of the album was:

# &quot;Black Cloud&quot; – Nigel Burch
# &quot;Talking To No One&quot; – Big Mehr and friend
# &quot;Born Crazy&quot; – Razz
# &quot;Sand All Yellow&quot; – Goldfish

*The downloaded version also includes two bonus tracks – Sally Timm&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Just A Man&quot; and Jon Langford&#x27;s &quot;Having a Party&quot; in Coyne&#x27;s own voice.

In 2008 Swiss performance artist Pipilotti Rist produced a video in which she mimes &quot;Jackie and Edna&quot; against the background of various images, including film taken from a moving train. This video was exhibited in Helsinki&#x27;s Kiasma Gallery in January 2012 as part of the &quot;Thank you for the Music&quot; exhibition.

==Critical appraisal==
Although Coyne has been neglected by popular music historians and academics, George McKay&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over: Popular Music and Disability&quot;, features a critical discussion of Coyne&#x27;s work. The book opens with an epigraph from Coyne: &#x27;anything that rhymes with &quot;me&quot;&#x27; (from the song &quot;Fat Girl&quot; as performed on the 1977 album &quot;In Living Black and White&quot;). Describing him as &#x27;the great lost English singer-songwriter&#x27; with his &#x27;social-work approach to pop&#x27;, McKay discusses the 1978 song &quot;Having a Party&quot; in the context of songs about the destructive economy of the pop industry. He also notes Coyne&#x27;s &#x27;anti-star&#x27; status and his innovative &#x27;anti&#x27;-guitar playing: &quot;Not being able, or electing not, to play the instrument &quot;properly&quot;, and hearing other voices while singing: there is something culturally disabling about each of these artistic choices, quite apart from the lyrical terrain&quot;.

On 15 June 2017 Coyne was commemorated with the unveiling of a blue plaque at the University of Derby Art School.

In January 2018, an exhibition of Coyne&#x27;s work was staged at the city gallery Alte Feuerwache in Amberg An exhibition, accompanied by a 70-page catalogue, compiled by Stefan Voit, was held from 9 June to 5 August 2018, at the Städtische Galerie Cordonhaus in Cham.

In 2024 Coyne was featured in &quot;Underground: The Illustrated Bible of Cursed Rockers and High Priestesses of Sound&quot; by Arnaud Le Gouefflec and Nicolas Moog.

BBC disc jockey Andy Kershaw described Coyne as &quot;a national treasure who keeps getting better&quot; and as one of the great British blues voices.

<doc id="1249193" wikidata="Q3403026" url="?curid=1249193" title="Symbol of Chaos">
<text>The Symbol of Chaos (also known as the Chaos Star) originates from Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Elric of Melniboné stories and their dichotomy of Law and Chaos. In them, the Symbol of Chaos comprises eight arrows in a radial pattern.

The symbol has been adopted in role-playing games such as &quot;Warhammer&quot; and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, as well as modern occult traditions, where it represents chaos magic, and also as a part of punk rock subculture and branches of modern anarchism.

==History==
Michael Moorcock conceived this symbol while writing the first Elric of Melniboné stories in the 1960s. It later became common in popular culture, appearing in occult traditions and role-playing games. In an interview, Moorcock described how he designed the symbol:
In the 1970s, the Chaos Star become the main symbol of chaos magic, a British occult tradition. It is the official symbol of the Illuminates of Thanateros, a magical organization dedicated to chaos magic.

The symbol&#x27;s first appearance in a commercial role-playing game was in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; supplement &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot;, which featured gods and monsters from Moorcock&#x27;s books. It was later adopted in &quot;Stormbringer&quot; (a role playing game based on Moorcock&#x27;s Elric stories), &quot;Warhammer&quot;,&quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, or &quot;Warhammer Age of Sigmar&quot;, among other games.

== Political uses ==

The Chaos Star in its original form has been adopted by multiple Eastern European and North and Latin American activist groups affiliated with post-leftism, insurrectionary anarchism and nihilist anarchism. The symbol likely came into modern anarchism movements from punk artwork and zines fulfilling the need for a unified symbol. A contributing factor to its adoption may be that Moorcock himself identifies as an anarchist.

According to Anton Shekhovtsov, Aleksandr Dugin has used a modified version of the symbol to represent his idea of Neo-Eurasianism, and it can be seen on the logo of his Eurasia Party and the cover of his book &quot;Foundations of Geopolitics.&quot;

<text>The Cassiobury Estate is a suburban residential area of Watford in Hertfordshire, England. It is bounded to the south by Cassiobury Park, the main public park in the town, to the west by playing fields next to the River Gade, and to the northeast by Hempstead Road. It is mostly characterised by 1930s Mock Tudor houses.

To the northwest of Cassiobury, outside the Borough of Watford in the Three Rivers District, is The Grove, the former estate and house of the Earls of Clarendon. This has been converted into a luxury hotel and with extensive grounds.

==History==
The suburban streets of Cassiobury were laid out in the early 1930s on land that was formerly part of the estate of Cassiobury House, the ancestral seat of the Earls of Essex. The house, which originally dated from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, contained lavishly decorated interiors and a substantial art collection and was surrounded by landscaped park land. Parts of the Cassiobury estate were sold for development land in 1908, and following the death of the 7th Earl of Essex in 1916, the family put the rest of estate up for sale in order to pay for death duties. Unable to find a buyer for the house, they had Cassiobury House demolished in 1927 and the estate was partly sold to Watford Borough Council to be used as a public park, with the remaining land sold to developers such as William King &amp; Co and Charles Brightman for housing development.

With the extension of the Metropolitan Railway to Watford in 1926, residential development around the new Watford tube station grew rapidly as the homes of Metro-land were constructed over the site of the former Essex mansion, and Humphry Repton&#x27;s landscaped vistas gave way to suburban lawns. The area of land once occupied by Cassiobury House is now where Temple Close sits, close to the Cassiobury Tennis Club.

Although the Essex mansion house no longer exists, traces of the area&#x27;s noble past remain; the Cassiobury House stable block (built c. 1805–1815) still stands on Richmond Drive; now called Cassiobury Court, the buildings have been Grade II listed and are now used as a drug rehabilitation centre. Several residential street names recall former Earls of Essex; Coningesby Drive, Devereux Drive, De Vere Walk and Capelvere Walk all bear names of former Lords of Cassiobury House.

==Geography==
==Transport==

The area is currently served by a London Underground station, Watford tube station, on Cassiobury Park Avenue, which is the terminus of the Metropolitan line&#x27;s Watford branch. This station is planned to close in the future when the line is diverted to terminate at as part of the Croxley Rail Link project; after this, Cassiobury will be served by a new Cassiobridge tube station instead, approximately south of the current station.

<text>Janet Kear (13 January 1933 – 24 November 2004) was an English ornithologist and conservationist who worked extensively on waterfowl and wrote several major works on ducks. She was the first woman to become president of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union (BOU).
==Early life and education==

Kear was born in Middlesex, the younger daughter of clerk Harold Kear and Constance May née Betteridge. Her brother David became a director-general of the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. She was educated at Walthamstow Hall, Sevenoaks, Caspar Junior College, Wyoming, King&#x27;s College London and then from 1956 Girton College, Cambridge, where she obtained her PhD on the feeding ecology of finches in 1959 under Robert A. Hinde.

==Career==
In 1959 Kear joined the staff of Peter Scott&#x27;s Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire. Her work included studies to breed Hawaiian goose and the reintroduction captive bred geese into the wild. She examined behaviour and development and made studies on geese grazing. She studied the health of waterfowl and methods for assessing them. From 1974 to 1977 she was the avicultural coordinator at WWT. She married Geoffrey Vernon Townsend Matthews, another researcher at the WWT, in 1964. They separated in 1978.

In 1977 she became curator of the trust&#x27;s new regional center at Martin Mere, Lancashire. She met John Victor Turner, a volunteer ornithologist, whom she married in New Zealand in 1993. She was also known for having a lot of intercorrelations with many men.

Kear was the first woman to become vice-president (1989–91), then president (1991–95) of the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union, and edited their &quot;Ibis&quot; magazine from 1980 to 1988. She authored more than 90 scientific papers. Her books included &quot;The Mute Swan&quot; (1989), &quot;Man And Wildfowl&quot; (1990) and &quot;Ducks of the World&quot; (1991). Kear was made a fellow of Liverpool University (1978–92) and an honorary doctorate with the title of professor from John Moores University in 1990. She received the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union&#x27;s medal in 1998. She was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1993.

==Death and legacy==
Kear died in 2004. At the time of her death, she was working on a biography of the early medieval saint Werburgh, who had an affinity with geese and is famous for bringing a goose back from the dead.

From 2019, the BOU&#x27;s redesigned Union Medal was renamed the &quot;Janet Kear Union Medal&quot;, in her honour.

<doc id="1249215" wikidata="Q1387359" url="?curid=1249215" title="McLaughlin (surname)">
<text>M(a)cLaughlin is the most common Anglicized form of &quot;Mac Lochlainn&quot;, a masculine surname of Irish origin. The feminine form of the surname is &quot;Nic Lochlainn&quot;. The literal meaning of the name is &quot;son of &quot;Lochlann&quot;&quot;. Note that &quot;Mc&quot; is simply a contraction of &quot;Mac&quot;, which is also (albeit rarely) truncated to &quot;M&#x27; &quot;. Thus, &quot;MacLaughlin&quot;, &quot;McLaughlin&quot; and &quot;M&#x27;Laughlin&quot; are the same Anglicism, the latter two merely contractions of the first.

The original surname Mac/Nic Lochlainn was borne by a family of Cenél nEógain, a branch of the historic northern O&#x27;Neill dynasty, reputedly founded by Niall Noígíallach. This family expanded across the North Channel into Scotland, where it became the Clan MacLachlan.

M(a)cLaughlin is sometimes used as a modern form of &quot;O&#x27;Melaghlin&quot;/&quot;Melaghlin&quot;, which is more commonly modernised &quot;McLoughlin&quot;, &quot;M&#x27;Loughlin&quot;, and &quot;O&#x27;Loughlin&quot; (among other spellings). O&#x27;Melaghlin was a phonetic rendering into Anglo-Norman and Middle English of &quot;ó Mǽilsheáchlainn&quot;. That family is part of the historic Clann Cholmáin, a branch of the Southern Uí Néill, cousins to the Northern Uí Néill. Ó/Ní M(h)ǽilsheáchlainn was the surname chosen by the descendants of Máel Sechnaill II, King of Meath, 976–1022, and High King of Ireland, 979–1002 &amp; 1014–1022.

M(a)cLaughlin and M(a)cLoughlin are rarely English forms of the surname &quot;ó/ní Lachtna&quot;, a phonetic corruption of the much more common &quot;Loughney&quot; or &quot;M(a)cLoughney&quot;.

Unlike Irish surnames that have only one Gaelic source for their English form, it is not possible to tell by the spelling &quot;McLaughlin&quot; and other English spellings whether the person bearing the name is descended from the &quot;Mac/Nic Lochlainn&quot; family, the &quot;Ó/Ní M(h)ǽilsheáchlainn&quot; family, or the &quot;Ó/Ní Lachtna&quot; family.

<text>The Lesotho national football team, also known as LNFT, represents Lesotho in men&#x27;s international association football and is governed by the Lesotho Football Association.

==History==

Following Lesotho&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom in 1966, the Lesotho Football Association was created, and later, the Lesotho national football team, which played its first match on 7 August 1970 against Malawi, where Lesotho won 2-1.

Lesotho participated in its first World Cup qualifiers, for the 1974 tournament, drawing 0–0 against Zambia at home before losing 1–6 in the second leg and getting eliminated. Lesotho was also eliminated in the first round of qualifying for the 1974 AFCON, losing 1–5 to Mauritius after a 0–0 draw in the first leg. Lesotho faced Mauritius again in their next attempt to qualify for 1980 AFCON, losing on away goals. In qualifying for the 1982 tournament, Lesotho lost 3–7 on aggregate to Mozambique. Lesotho then faced Guinea in the 1982 World Cup first qualification round, losing 4–2 on aggregate.

Lesotho won their first ever qualification tie during the 1994 AFCON qualifiers, beating Botswana 4–0 on aggregate, with all four goals coming in the second leg in Botswana. With this victory they entered the group stage of qualifying, managing to draw against Kenya (2–2), Zaire (1–1), and Mozambique (1–1) at home, but losing all three away fixtures to finish bottom of the group.

Lesotho withdrew from the 1996 AFCON qualification and was subsequently banned from the next tournament therefore next entered the 2000 AFCON qualifiers, losing in the first round to Mauritius. Lesotho qualified for the 1999 COSAFA Cup after beating Namibia 1–0, but lost to eventual winners Angola 0–1 in the quarter-finals. The following year Lesotho produced their best ever finish at the 2000 COSAFA Cup, only qualifying for the tournament via disciplinary record. They beat Zambia 3–1 on penalties before scoring two late goals against Angola in the semi-finals to win 2–1. In the final they lost 3–0 twice across two legs to Zimbabwe to finish as runners-up.

<doc id="1249227" wikidata="Q7646003" url="?curid=1249227" title="Surface micromachining">
<text>Surface micromachining builds microstructures by deposition and etching structural layers over a substrate. This is different from Bulk micromachining, in which a silicon substrate wafer is selectively etched to produce structures.

== Layers ==
Generally, polysilicon is used as one of the substrate layers while silicon dioxide is used as a &quot;sacrificial layer.&quot; The sacrificial layer is removed or etched out to create any necessary void in the thickness direction. Added layers tend to vary in size from 2-5 micrometres. The main advantage of this machining process is the ability to build electronic and mechanical components (functions) on the same substrate. Surface micro-machined components are smaller compared to their bulk micro-machined counterparts.

As the structures are built on top of the substrate and not inside it, the substrate&#x27;s properties are not as important as in bulk micro-machining. Expensive silicon wafers can be replaced by cheaper substrates, such as glass or plastic. The size of the substrates may be larger than a silicon wafer, and surface micro-machining is used to produce thin-film transistors on large area glass substrates for flat panel displays. This technology can also be used for the manufacture of thin film solar cells, which can be deposited on glass, polyethylene terepthalate substrates or other non-rigid materials.

==Fabrication process==
Micro-machining starts with a silicon wafer or other substrate upon which new layers are grown. These layers are selectively etched by photo-lithography; either a wet etch involving an acid, or a dry etch involving an ionized gas (or plasma). Dry etching can combine chemical etching with physical etching or ion bombardment. Surface micro-machining involves as many layers as are needed with a different mask (producing a different pattern) on each layer. Modern integrated circuit fabrication uses this technique and can use as many as 100 layers. Micro-machining is a younger technology and usually uses no more than 5 or 6 layers. Surface micro-machining uses developed technology (although sometimes not enough for demanding applications) which is easily repeatable for volume production.

===Sacrificial layers===
A sacrificial layer is used to build complicated components, such as movable parts. For example, a suspended cantilever can be built by depositing and structuring a sacrificial layer, which is then selectively removed at the locations where the future beams must be attached to the substrate (i.e. the anchor points). A structural layer is then deposited on top of the polymer and structured to define the beams. Finally, the sacrificial layer is removed to release the beams, using a selective etch process that does not damage the structural layer.

Many combinations of structural and sacrificial layers are possible. The combination chosen depends on the process. For example, it is important for the structural layer not to be damaged by the process used to remove the sacrificial layer.

== Examples ==
Surface Micro-machining can be seen in action in the following MEMS (Microelectromechanical) products:

* Surface Micro-machined accelerometers
* 3D Flexible Multichannel Neural Probe array
* Nanoelectromechanical relays

<text>The Congo Craton, covered by the Palaeozoic-to-recent Congo Basin, is an ancient Precambrian craton that with four others (the Kaapvaal, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and West African cratons) makes up the modern continent of Africa. These cratons were formed between about 3.6 and 2.0 billion years ago and have been tectonically stable since that time. All of these cratons are bounded by younger fold belts formed between 2.0 billion and 300 million years ago.

The Congo Craton occupies a large part of central southern Africa, extending from the Kasai region of the DRC into Sudan and Angola. It forms parts of the countries of Gabon, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic. A small portion extends into Zambia as well, where it is called the Bangweulu Block.

==Congo–São Francisco==
The Congo Craton and the São Francisco Craton are stable Archaean blocks that formed a coherent landmass until the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean during the break-up of Gondwana ( 2000–130 Ma). They stabilised during the Transamazonian orogeny and Eburnean Orogeny and have been affected by a long series of orogens since resulting in similar sequences on both blocks.

Congo–São Francisco experienced three large igneous province (LIP) events at 1380–1370 Ma, 1505 Ma, and 1110 Ma. The relative position of Congo–São Francisco within the supercontinent Nuna/Columbia can be reconstructed because these LIP events also affected other Precambrian continental blocks. Within Nuna the northern part of Siberia was located adjacent to western São Francisco. 1110 Ma dyke swarms in Angola are absent in Siberia but coincide with the Umkondo LIP on the Kalahari Craton and magmatic event in the Bundelkhand Craton in India, the Amazonian Craton in South America, and the Keweenawan Rift in Laurentia (although the latter was located far from the other continental blocks).
A series of 1500 Ma dyke swarms also support the close relation between Congo–São Francisco and Siberia: Kuonamka in Siberia and Curaçá and Chapada Diamantina in São Francisco and Angola. These dyke swarms radiate from a mantle plume centre located in what is now north-eastern Siberia. Magmatic events in Congo (Kunene) and Siberia (Chieress) at 1384 Ma also corroborate the closeness of these two continents during at least 120 million years.

It is possible that the 1110 Ma LIP in Congo–São Francisco, Amazonia, and India was part of a much larger event that also involved West Africa and Kalahari (with a possible but unlikely link to the 1075 Ma Warakurna LIP in Australia). However, while the palaeo-latitudes of India and Kalahari are well constrained, those of Amazonia and Congo–São Francisco are not, making any plate tectonic reconstruction speculative.

At the time for the formation of the supercontinent Gondwana at 550  the Congo Craton formed the already amalgamated central African landmass. The southern and eastern margins (modern coordinates) of this landmass was made of the Archaean Angola-Kasai block and Tanzanian Craton. These proto-Congo blocks were deformed in the Palaeoproterozoic Eburnean orogeny but later stabilised.

===West Congo Belt===
Before the opening of the South Atlantic the São Francisco and Congo cratons were connected by a &quot;cratonic&quot; bridge, the Bahia–Gabon Bridge. The most recent orogenic event on this bridge occurred at 2 Ga, so the connection between São Francisco and Congo must have formed during the Palaeoproterozoic. South of this cratonic bridge the Araçuaí–West Congo orogen evolved in the Neoproterozoic in a sea basin made of oceanic crust, an embayment in the São Francisco–Congo continent.

The West Congo Pan-African Belt includes major magmatic events at 1000 and 910 Ma. In the Early Neoproterozoic, the western edge of Congo Craton was the location for the initial rifting of Rodinia before its break-up. During the Neoproterozoic, Central Congo or Bas-Congo became a passive margin on which was deposited sediments. At the end of the Neoproterozoic, Bas-Congo was only affected by the Pan-African orogeny at 566 Ma to a limited extent protected by this passive margin and by the thickness of the craton.
At 1000 Ma peralkaline magmatism initiated an early transtensional setting along the western edge of the Congo Craton. An LIP at 930–920 Ma was followed by felsic magmatism between 920–910 Ma which had a short emplacement interval and resulted in a thick sequence.
Mafic-felsic magma sequences ( thick) on the western edge of the Congo Craton are similar to those of the Paraná and Deccan LIPs, but in the Congo Craton the magma source became shallower with time. There was no geodynamic activity along the western Congo margin during the Mesoproterozoic.

<doc id="1249233" wikidata="Q17157187" url="?curid=1249233" title="Zug Island">
<text>Zug Island is a heavily industrialized island within the city of River Rouge at the southern city limits of Detroit in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located where the mouth of the River Rouge spills into the Detroit River. Zug Island is not a natural island in the river; it was formed when a shipping canal was dug along the southwestern side of the island, allowing ships to bypass several hundred yards of twisting waterway near the mouth of the natural course of the lowest portions of the River Rouge.

==History==
Originally a marsh-filled peninsula at the mouth of the River Rouge, it served as an uninhabited Native American burial ground for thousands of years. Upon European arrival, the land was incorporated into Ecorse Township, making up the very northeast corner of the township. The beginning of interest in developing the land came when Samuel Zug, one of the founders of the Republican Party and a staunch abolitionist, came to Detroit from Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, in 1836 to make his fortune in the furniture industry with the money he earned as a bookkeeper. Shortly after, Marcus Stevenson, a Detroit financier, went into business with him.

The Stevenson &amp; Zug Furniture Company flourished until 1859 when Samuel Zug, by then a rich man, dissolved the partnership. He decided to invest in real estate to provide security for his wife, Anna. Envisioning a luxurious estate on the Detroit River, Zug bought of marshy land below Fort Wayne from the town of Delray in 1876. But the dampness was too much for the Zugs, and after 10 years they abandoned their home.

In 1888, Zug allowed the River Rouge Improvement Company to cut a small canal through the south section of his property to more directly connect the Rouge River to the Detroit River. This Short Cut Canal, as it came to be known, was enlarged in the early 1920s by Henry Ford to allow large ships to more easily navigate to the Ford River Rouge Complex. In 1891, Zug completed the largest real estate transaction of the decade: he sold his island for $300,000 to industries that wanted it as a dumping ground.

Zug became interested in politics and served as Wayne County Auditor under Gov. John J. Bagley. He died in 1896 when he was 80.

==Steel mill==
The Detroit Iron Works brought ironmaking to Zug Island in 1901 with the commissioning of a blast furnace built in 1902. In 1904 the works was purchased by the M.A. Hanna Company of Cleveland, Ohio, which built a second blast furnace in 1909. At this time the island&#x27;s two furnaces were reportedly the largest of their kind in the world, producing pig iron for foundry companies. The plant expanded and became part of the Great Lakes Steel Corporation in late 1931, becoming a key component of a fully integrated steel mill and a division of the larger National Steel Corporation. A third blast furnace was added in early 1938 while the existing furnaces were rebuilt and enlarged.

When National Steel became insolvent in 2003 most of the island&#x27;s facilities were purchased, along with the rest of what is now called the Great Lakes Works, by United States Steel, which currently operates the mill. The island is home to the mill&#x27;s ironmaking facilities (the rest of the mill&#x27;s facilities, primarily steelmaking and processing, are located at the main plant a few miles south in the city of Ecorse) which includes 3 blast furnaces (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot;) and raw materials storage areas. Ships supply large ore docks along the north (&quot;1 Dock&quot;) and east (&quot;3 Dock&quot;) shores of the island and large coal/coke/ore storage fields along the south and west (&quot;B Area&quot;) shores. Number 5 Coke Battery located there, once an integral part of the mill, is independently owned and operated by EES Coke LLC, a DTE Energy company. Delray Connecting Railroad, a subsidiary of U.S. Steel company, also operates some rail facilities on the island. A &quot;2-way&quot; vehicle/rail bridge is the main access to the island. Secondary vehicle and rail bridges (the &quot;Swing Bridge&quot;) at the southwestern corner of the island also allow mainland access.

Iron produced at Zug Island was transported in bottle cars via rail to steelmaking at the main plant while DTE&#x27;s coke is shipped via rail to supply consumers, chiefly ISG/Mittal, in the merchant metallurgical market. During the industry&#x27;s peak, thousands of workers were employed on the island with a large percentage of the downriver community supported by the local steel producer. Recently a few hundred people worked on the island with the hourly workers at U.S. Steel represented by United Steelworkers Local 1299. In fall of 2008 U.S. Steel halted its production due to the economic downturn, but restarted it in fall of 2009.

U.S. Steel announced in December 2019 that it would idle most of its operations in the area, including all of its operations on Zug Island, by April 2020. Primary steelmaking activities shut down in April 2020, and the hot strip mill shut down in June of the same year, but in January 2021, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reported that there remained 500 employees working at the plant, and that &quot;a few operations [were] ongoing — as long as demand will support them&quot;.

==Wildlife==

Despite the island&#x27;s extremely developed industrial landscape, areas along the south and west shores are left undeveloped to provide habitat for wildlife. Foxes and once-endangered peregrine falcons, which frequent large outdoor structures such as the gantry cranes at the ore docks, thrive on the island and offshore. At the bottom of the Detroit River is a man-made bed of coal cinders which serves as a rare spawning site for lake sturgeon, a threatened species. Less desirable are the sizable and sometimes troublesome populations of gulls, feral cats and rats.

==Environmental impact==

One of the most pressing problems in the neighborhoods surrounding Zug Island is poor air quality. According to an article in the January 20, 2010, edition of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, the neighborhoods around the area compose six of the ten most polluted zip codes in Michigan. In the article, residents cite air quality samples containing lead and high levels of methyl ethyl ketone, large numbers of cancer and asthma cases, and foul smells with &quot;sparkly&quot; dust that must be removed with toilet cleaner. Interviewed separately, residents of the area say the foul smells are strong enough to cause dry heaves.

===Noise and vibration===
In 2011, the Zug Island area was identified by Canadian scientists and Ontario&#x27;s Ministry of Natural Resources as the source of mysterious rumblings and vibrations, known as &quot;The Hum&quot;, that plagued hundreds of area residents with cyclical vibrations, reportedly being felt in the ground up to fifty miles (eighty kilometres) away.

The city of River Rouge reported in the &quot;Star&quot; that it cannot afford to spend any more money on investigating the hum. They claim the City Council had already spent over $1 million to help Windsor and Ontario find the source of the noise. However, they say it likely comes from the steel mill facilities on the island.

In April 2013, a Canadian scientist used sound-level meters and a portable &quot;pentangular array&quot; of cameras and microphones to try to accurately identify the source of the sound, in order to know whom exactly to ask to fix it.

The results of the 2013 study were released on May 23, 2014. Although contemporaneous news reports claim the study confirmed that Zug Island was the source of the Hum,
the report&#x27;s findings actually stated &quot;the most probable source of the Hum points well to the South of Zug Island. The bulk of our observations from both stations do not support the hypothesis that the source of the Hum emanates from Zug Island.&quot;

Reports of the Hum ceased after the US Steel plant on Zug Island ceased operations in April 2020.

In April 2024, an alleged former worker at Zug Island claimed in an r/IAmA thread that the plant&#x27;s byproducts flare stacks were the origins of the hum.

==In popular culture==
The island is mostly off-limits to the public. Cameras are prohibited on the premises, so pictures of the island&#x27;s interior are rare. Due to its location and relative security, many urban legends exist regarding the island. One popular legend claims that the island is home to a correctional facility or prison, but no such facility exists on the island. Another popular claim is that parts of the movie &quot;RoboCop&quot; were filmed there. The island is mentioned by name in the movie, but the steel mill shots in &quot;RoboCop&quot; were actually filmed at the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.&#x27;s Monessen Works in Pennsylvania.

The SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; of Great Lakes shipwreck fame was laden with taconite destined for Zug Island on her fateful voyage in 1975.

In 2011, Detroit based author Gregory Fournier published his novel, &quot;Zug Island: A Detroit Riot Novel&quot;.

Zug Izland, a Detroit-based rock band in association with Insane Clown Posse, named themselves after the island and self describe their sound as &quot;Juggalo Rock&quot;. ICP themselves have made references to Zug Island in their songs &quot;The Shaggy Show&quot;, &quot;In the Haughhh!&quot; &quot;Cotton Candy &amp; Popsicles&quot; and &quot;Toxic Love&quot;. This is likely due to its proximity to the Delray/River Rouge area, where the members spent some of their youth. In fact, part of the island can be seen in the background of the cover photo for Insane Clown Posse (at the time, Inner City Posse)&#x27;s EP, &quot;Dog Beats&quot;.

==History==
===Postwar era===
The base became operational in January 1943, training new pilots on multi-engine aircraft. The primary training aircraft were the Cessna AT-17 Bobcat and the Curtiss-Wright AT-9 Jeep. On 15 May 1945, the airfield was placed on temporary inactive status.

It later became an aircraft disposal point for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.

===Cold War===
The base sat idle for only a few years. The onset of the Korean War in June 1950 created the need for more staff to fly

During the 1950s, the base underwent many changes and changed hands from TAC to the Strategic Air Command (SAC). Later that year, on 18 November, the 96th Bombardment Wing, Medium (96 BMW), arrived and began operations with three bomber squadrons and one air refueling squadron. The squadrons eventually flew the first all jet-engined bomber, the B-47 Stratojet and the KC-97 Stratofreighter, a dual-purpose cargo and air-refueling aircraft. By the end of the decade, both of these aircraft would be replaced by aircraft still in the Air Force inventory, the KC-135 Stratotanker and the B-52 Stratofortress. The KC-135 was the first all jet-engined air-refueling aircraft and the B-52 still remains the backbone of the USAF bomber fleet. When the 96th BW moved to Dyess AFB, Texas, the 11th Bombardment Wing (Heavy) activated and stood on alert during the Cold War.

June 1961 witnessed the activation of twelve Atlas “F” intercontinental ballistic missile sites within a 40-mile radius of the base. Controlled by the 577th Strategic Missile Squadron, the missiles sat inside a silo, constructed underground with a launch facility, and staffed around the clock. The missile silos became operational on 10 October 1962, but the activation would be short-lived. The missile at the Frederick, OK, site exploded in May 1964. The missiles were outdated. By April 1965, the missiles were phased out of the national strategic defense plan.

In August 1966, the 4th Mobile Communications Group transferred from Hunter AFB, Georgia, to Altus. The unit&#x27;s mission consisted of providing mobile and transportable communication services, aiding navigation and air traffic control throughout the world.

In 1967, the Air Force began searching for a base that could handle the training for its strategic airlift fleet, the C-141 Starlifter and its newest and largest transport aircraft, the C-5 Galaxy. Again, Oklahoma proved to be well suited for the mission. The Military Airlift Command (MAC) assumed command of the base from SAC and activated the 443d Military Airlift Wing (443 MAW), Training, to assume host wing responsibilities and to fly alongside the SAC aircraft that would become a tenant command at Altus.

By the start of the 1970s, Altus AFB had three aircraft type/models assigned: KC-135s, C-141s, and C-5s. For the KC-135 aircraft at Altus still under SAC&#x27;s control, the USAF activated the 340th Air Refueling Wing, which continued to operate the base&#x27;s KC-135s.

=== The 1990s and beyond ===

The post Cold War environment brought many changes to Altus AFB. On 1 June 1992, the Air Force reorganized and the Military Airlift Command (MAC) disestablished. In its place the new Air Mobility Command (AMC) was activated, which placed MAC&#x27;s strategic and tactical airlift aircraft and SAC&#x27;s aerial refueling aircraft under a single command. Second, the 443d Airlift Wing and the 340th Air Refueling Wing were inactivated, with the latter&#x27;s aircraft transferred to the 19th Air Refueling Wing at Robins AFB, Georgia.

On 1 October, the first Air Mobility Wing (AMW), the 97th Air Mobility Wing (97 AMW), arrived Altus without personnel or equipment, having formerly been designated as SAC&#x27;s 97th Bombardment Wing and having been transferred from the deactivating Eaker AFB, Arkansas as a result of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action. The 97 AMW was tasked with flight crew formal training unit (FTU) responsibilities for the C-141 and C-5 aircrew, and with the closure of Castle AFB, California due to BRAC action, concurrently assumed FTU responsibilities for KC-135E/R/T flight crews. On 1 July 1993, the 97th was transferred from AMC to the newly established Air Education and Training Command (AETC) as part of a USAF initiative to move most FTU activities to AETC.

More changes were on the horizon. In 1996, the latest addition to Altus AFB, the new C-17 Globemaster III, arrived. Even before its arrival, the base began training pilots and loadmasters to operate and fly the aircraft.

In August 2002, the mission of the wing grew when the Air Force moved the basic loadmaster course from Sheppard AFB, Texas, to Altus. This initiative combined similar training programs to reduce the number of moves required by trainees while cutting overall costs. Additionally, during that same month, the wing reorganized as a &quot;combat wing&quot;: the 97th Support Group became the 97th Mission Support Group, gaining the new 97th Logistics Readiness Squadron (comprising the former 97th Supply Squadron, 97th Transportation Squadron and logistics plans flight) and the 97th Contracting Squadron. Also, the 97th Logistics Group inactivated and the 97th Maintenance Directorate was activated. The directorate comprises civil-service personnel, who are responsible for the care and maintenance of all three airframes at the base.

The 97 AMW discontinued FTU responsibilities for the C-141 concurrent with that aircraft&#x27;s retirement from the USAF inventory in 2006. On 1 July 2007, the Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s (AFRC) 433d Airlift Wing (433 AW) at Lackland AFB/Kelly Field (former Kelly AFB) assumed responsibility for all flying training and academic training for the C-5 aircraft for all Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) aircrews, leaving the 97 AMW and Altus to concentrate on C-17A, KC-135R, and KC-46A training for AMC, USAFE, PACAF, AFRC and ANG aircrews.

<text>Alexander Anatolyevich Shabalov (; ; born September 12, 1967) is an American chess grandmaster and a four-time winner of the United States Chess Championship (1993, 2000, 2003, 2007). He also won or tied for first place seven times in the U.S. Open Chess Championship (1993, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2015, 2016).

==Chess career==
Shabalov was born in Riga, Latvia, and was known during much of his career for courting complications even at the cost of objective soundness, much like his fellow Latvians Mikhail Tal and Alexei Shirov. He has transitioned to a more conservative and positional playing style as of 2019.

In 1997 and 2000, Shabalov tied for first place at the U.S. Masters Chess Championship.
In 2002, he tied for first place at the Aeroflot Open in Moscow with Gregory Kaidanov, Alexander Grischuk, Aleksej Aleksandrov, and Vadim Milov.
In 2009, Shabalov shared first place with Fidel Corrales Jimenez in the American Continental Chess Championship.

Shabalov regularly lectured chess players of all ages at the House of Chess, a store he ran at Ross Park Mall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, until it closed in mid-2007.

In 2015 he was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame.

In 2019, Shabalov won the 23rd annual Eastern Chess Congress.

In 2020, Shabalov won the 52nd annual Liberty Bell Open.

Shabalov won the 2022 U.S. Senior Championship, defeating Grandmaster Larry Christiansen in the final round of the tournament to claim victory.

In 2024, Shabalov won the over-50 category of the World Senior Chess Championship.

<text>Trevor John Cherry (23 February 1948 – 29 April 2020) was an English footballer who notably captained both England and Leeds United. A defender, Cherry also played for Huddersfield Town and Bradford City, and managed the latter club.

Born in Huddersfield, he started his career at his hometown team before he made his name at Leeds United during the 1970s, making 486 appearances and winning the Championship title in 1973–74. He won a total of 27 international caps and captained the England team on one occasion.

==Playing career==
===Huddersfield Town===
Born in Huddersfield on 23 January 1948, Cherry joined his hometown club Huddersfield Town as part of the groundstaff in July 1963 as a 15-year-old from the Huddersfield YMCA, before signing a full-time professional contract in 1965. He made his debut in 1965, aged 17, establishing himself as a classy defender who could play anywhere across the back line, and helped Huddersfield win the Second Division title in the 1969–70 season. They were relegated after two seasons in the top flight and in 1972 Cherry left for local rivals Leeds United after making a total of 188 appearances; he had impressed Leeds manager Don Revie enough for him to consider him a potential replacement for Jack Charlton.

===Leeds United===
Cherry – along with teammate Roy Ellam – moved along the M62 in 1972 when Leeds paid £100,000 to Huddersfield for his services. He ended up playing both alongside and instead of Charlton in his first season but predominantly at left back, replacing broken leg victim Terry Cooper. By the end of the season Cherry had amassed 38 League appearances and was selected by Revie for the 1973 FA Cup final, which Leeds lost to Sunderland.

He did, however, win the League championship with Leeds in 1973–74, as the team went on a record 29-match unbeaten run at the start of the season to make sure the title would be theirs; Cherry spent much of the season at left back, playing 38 times in total. The following season, 1974–75, was a mixed year for Cherry. Injury curtailed half of his season, but he recovered in time to help Leeds in their European Cup campaign as they progressed towards the semi-finals and a game against Barcelona. Cherry marked Dutch legend Johan Cruyff out of each leg as Leeds reached the final, but after missing subsequent League matches through suspension, manager Jimmy Armfield placed him on the substitute&#x27;s bench for the final against Bayern Munich, and he did not play.

In 1976, Cherry became Leeds captain after Billy Bremner left, and won his first England cap. He continued to play for Leeds until 1982, the year that the club were relegated to the Second Division, and won the club&#x27;s Player of The Season award in 1981. In 2000, Cherry was voted the 30th best Leeds United player by its fans.

===Bradford City and management===
Cherry played three months of Second Division football for Leeds before leaving for another neighbouring club, Bradford City, where he became player-manager. He played for three years until he retired to concentrate on management. His final game in football was City&#x27;s 2–0 win against Bolton Wanderers on 6 May 1985 which captured the Division Three title. Cherry also won the Third Division manager of the season award. However, Cherry&#x27;s own personal success paled into insignificance when the Valley Parade ground was devastated by the Bradford City stadium fire during the final game of the season on 11 May 1985, killing 56 people. The subsequent appeal to raise money for the bereaved families and injured supporters raised more than four million pounds, and Cherry was among the mourners at many funerals.

He steered Bradford to 13th place the following season despite the club having to play home games at three other grounds; Odsal Stadium, Bradford and his former home grounds of Elland Road and Leeds Road. Cherry was manager when City returned to Valley Parade in December 1986 but was sacked the following month when the club was struggling – a surprise decision that provoked angry demonstrations against the board.

==International career==
Cherry won his first English cap on 24 March 1976 against Wales. He became the first England player to be sent off in an international friendly, when he was sent off against Argentina in 1977. Cherry lost two teeth after being punched in the mouth by Daniel Bertoni, whom Cherry had felled with a nasty tackle from behind; Bertoni also received a red card.

England did not qualify for the 1978 World Cup, but did so for the 1980 European Championships, and Cherry was included in the squad of 22 to travel there. In a warm-up game just before the tournament, Cherry captained his country for the only time in a 2–1 win against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. His tournament was limited, however, to a single substitute appearance against Spain. It was to be his 27th and final cap.

==Post-football==
After he was sacked by Bradford City, Cherry gave up football in general for a number of years. He ran a promotions and hospitality company in Huddersfield, a waste paper company and a five-a-side football centre. In 2004, he also made a bid to buy into Leeds United. He was also given an honorary degree by the University of Huddersfield in November 2005.

Cherry died suddenly on 29 April 2020, aged 72 from COVID-19. He was survived by his wife Sue, with whom he had two sons and a daughter, and five grandchildren.

<text>Franklin Burr Tillstrom (October 13, 1917 – December 6, 1985) was a puppeteer and the creator of &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot;.

==Early life==
Tillstrom was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Bert and Alice Burr Tillstrom. He attended Senn High School in Chicago and later the University of Chicago. While still a freshman, he accepted a job offer from the WPA-Chicago Parks District Theatre to set up a marionette theater.

==Career==
Tillstrom turned his attention to puppetry in the early 1930s and created Kukla in 1936. Kukla remained nameless until the Russian ballerina Tamara Toumanova referred to him as &quot;kukla&quot;, the Russian word for &quot;doll&quot;. Other famous puppets from Tillstrom&#x27;s group included Ollie (Oliver J. Dragon), Beulah Witch, Goultar, Cecil Bill, and Fletcher Rabbit. In 1939, Tillstrom was invited to present his Kuklapolitan Players at the New York World&#x27;s Fair. The following year, RCA sent him to Bermuda to perform on the first ship-to-shore broadcast.

From 1947 to 1957, Tillstrom was involved with the &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; show, which starred his puppets and Fran Allison. It is widely regarded as being the first children&#x27;s show to appeal to both children and adults, and counted Orson Welles, John Steinbeck, Tallulah Bankhead, Adlai Stevenson, and James Thurber among its many adult fans. With only a few exceptions, all of the shows were improvised.

After the original series ended in 1957, Tillstrom continued to work with the Kuklapolitans. Early in 1958, Tillstrom appeared with the puppets on Polly Bergen&#x27;s short-lived NBC variety show, &quot;The Polly Bergen Show&quot;.

Tillstrom, Kukla and Ollie reunited with Fran Allison to host the &quot;CBS Children&#x27;s Film Festival&quot; from 1967 to 1977. In 1970, &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; appeared on National Educational Television, taped at WTTW in Chicago, for two seasons. In 1975, &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; began another run on television with 13 new episodes.

In 1977, The &quot;Kukla and Ollie Retrospective Stage Show&quot; tours began, a creation of the Artist-in-Residence program at Hope College. In 1978, Kukla, Burr and Ollie joined the Broadway cast of &quot;Side by Side by Sondheim&quot;, a revue of Stephen Sondheim songs.

Tillstrom continued to perform with his Kuklapolitan Players until his death at age 68 in Palm Springs, California on December 6, 1985. He was found sitting in a chair near his swimming pool and appeared to have died from natural causes. He was buried at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago. His papers are held at the Chicago History Museum.

==Honors==
On March 23, 1986, Burr Tillstrom was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame for his creativity and innovation in the medium. The Saugatuck Douglas Art Club in Saugatuck, Michigan (the location of Tillstrom&#x27;s longtime summer home) dedicated a memorial to Tillstrom in 1988. The Burr Tillstrom Collection and Archives are maintained at the Chicago History Museum.

In 2013 Tillstrom was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.

In 1999, the City of Chicago honored Tillstrom with a historical marker at 1407 W. Sherwin in the Rogers Park neighborhood, where he was living when he first debuted &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie.&quot;

<text>Bulk micromachining is a process used to produce micromachinery or microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).

Unlike surface micromachining, which uses a succession of thin film deposition and selective etching, bulk micromachining defines structures by selectively etching inside a substrate. Whereas surface micromachining creates structures &quot;on top&quot; of a substrate, bulk micromachining produces structures &quot;inside&quot; a substrate.

Usually, silicon wafers are used as substrates for bulk micromachining, as they can be anisotropically wet etched, forming highly regular structures. Wet etching typically uses alkaline liquid solvents, such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) or tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to dissolve silicon which has been left exposed by the photolithography masking step. These alkali solvents dissolve the silicon in a highly anisotropic way, with some crystallographic orientations dissolving up to 1000 times faster than others. Such an approach is often used with very specific crystallographic orientations in the raw silicon to produce V-shaped grooves. The surface of these grooves can be atomically smooth if the etch is carried out correctly, and the dimensions and angles can be precisely defined. Pressure sensors are usually created by bulk micromachining technique.

Bulk micromachining starts with a silicon wafer or other substrates which is selectively etched, using photolithography to transfer a pattern from a mask to the surface. Like surface micromachining, bulk micromachining can be performed with wet or dry etches, although the most common etch in silicon is the anisotropic wet etch. This etch takes advantage of the fact that silicon has a crystal structure, which means its atoms are all arranged periodically in lines and planes. Certain planes have weaker bonds and are more susceptible to etching. The etch results in pits that have angled walls, with the angle being a function of the crystal orientation of the substrate. This type of etching is inexpensive and is generally used in early, low-budget research.

<text>The Mühlacker Broadcasting Transmission Facility is a radio transmission facility near Mühlacker, Germany, first put into service on November 21, 1930. It uses two guyed steel tube masts as aerials and one guyed steel framework mast, which are insulated against ground. It has two transmission aerials for shortwave and one free standing steel framework tower for directional radio services. The shortwave transmitter was shut off on October 19, 2004. The medium wave transmitter was switched off in January 2012.

==Description==
At time of inauguration in 1930 the transmitter, which had a power of 60 kW, used a T-type antenna spun between two 100 m high wooden lattice towers placed 310 m apart. As this antenna produced large amounts of skywave, the area of undistorted fading-free reception - was in spite of its high transmission power - at night not as large as planned and so it was planned to replace this antenna by an aerial with better skywave suppression. So in 1933–34, a 190 m high wooden tower - the tallest structure ever built of wood - was built, in which a vertical wire antenna, which was electrically enlengthened by a metal ring with 10.6 metres diameters on the top of the tower, was hung up. At this time transmission power was also increased from 60 kW to 100 kW. After inauguration of this antenna, the two original wooden towers were dismantled. One of them was rebuilt at Koblenz, the other at Frankfurt-Heiligenstock. In 1939/1940 a second 100 kW transmitter was installed. It used as antenna a system of 3 T-antennas, which were mounted on 3 50 metres tall guyed masts arranged in a triangle. In opposite to the first transmitter, it was including its aerial designed for a quick change of broadcasting frequency, which was done in case of air attacks in order to form a single frequency network with other transmitters, which hindered hostile aircraft using the signals.

Today, the most important aerial mast in Mühlacker is a 273 m high guyed steel tube mast with a diameter of 1.67 m, located at . This mast, which was built in 1950, is used as a transmitter for the mediumwave frequency 576 kHz and is therefore insulated against ground. It is designed as an antifading aerial and is therefore double-feedable and insulated. The mast is topped with a butterfly aerial for FM-broadcasting transmitters.

There are flight safety lamps near the ground end of the guy ropes, to make the span of the guy ropes more visible.

Two other radio masts, with heights of 130 m and 80 m, were located at the Mühlacker site.

*The 130 m high mast, situated at , was a steel tube mast, insulated against ground. Before 1996, it was used as a director during nighttime and a spare during daytime. Transmission power was reduced to 100 kW in 1996 and the mast was obsolete and used only as a spare aerial. It was demolished in 2013.
*The 80 m high radio mast, located at , is an insulated guyed steel framework mast with a triangular cross section. It was built in 1977 in order to improve transmission towards the south. It was also used to carry aerials for mobile phone services. It has been demolished.

The three masts are arranged in a nearly straight line on the site. A T-type aerial for shortwave transmission is fixed between two small guyed steel framework masts, but was shut down on October 19, 2004. It was later dismantled.

In 1948, a 110 m tall guyed steel framework mast was built on the site at This served as a transmission aerial for the American Forces Network (AFN) until 1963. From 1963 until its demolition in November 1993, the mast was used as part of a directional aerial for a mediumwave transmitter. It also served as a spare FM transmitter with a butterfly aerial installed on top. The mast was demolished because it was in poor repair and was deemed no longer necessary. Plans for a new mast have not been realized.

Also located here at was a 50 m steel framework mast insulated against ground. It was part of the directional aerial for the AFN transmitter described above. After 1963, it was only used as an aerial for the internal mobile radio service of the transmission facility. It was demolished in April, 2004 and replaced in the summer of 2004 with a 93 m high freestanding steel framework tower carrying aerials for directional services.

<doc id="1249266" wikidata="Q664272" url="?curid=1249266" title="Qantassaurus">
<text>Qantassaurus ( ) is a genus of basal two-legged, plant-eating elasmarian ornithischian dinosaur that lived in Australia about 125-112 million years ago, when the continent was still partly south of the Antarctic Circle. It was described by Patricia Vickers-Rich and her husband Tom Rich in 1999 after a find near Inverloch, and named after Qantas, the Australian airline.

==Description==

&quot;Qantassaurus&quot; was probably about 1.8 meters (6 feet) long, and about one meter (3 feet) high. If it resembled its relatives, it had short thighs and long shins, and probably was a fast runner. Its feet had claws for traction, and a long tail probably helped with turning, stiffened by ossified tendons. One characteristic of the &quot;Polar Victorian&quot; euornithopods are distinctive spurs, or trochanters, on the upper surface of the thigh bone (or femur), where muscle was attached.

&quot;Qantassaurus&quot; is only known from jaw fragments. These are foreshortened compared to related species so its face was probably short and stocky. It had ten teeth in each lower jaw. It probably had a beak, and possessed leaf-shaped teeth back in its cheek, which were shed as they wore down, and replaced by new teeth growing up from the jaw. The teeth had eight distinctive vertical ridges on the outer side with a single larger primary ridge in the centre. Like its close relative &quot;Leaellynasaura&quot;, its diet consisted of plants like ferns and horsetails.

&quot;Qantassaurus&quot; lived 127.2-125 million years ago in Australia, during the late Barremian age of the early Cretaceous period. At the time, Australia was part of the supercontinent of Gondwana, and partly within the Antarctic Circle, although the significance of polar conditions during the warm Cretaceous were greatly different from conditions in this region today. The average temperature of the region is contentious, with estimates ranging from -6 to well over 5 °C (21 to 37 °F). Conditions were likely to be at their coldest during the polar nights, which lasted up to three months.

One interpretation of the fossil material is that small ornithopods had adaptations to survive cooler conditions. Bone growth of presumed related taxa shows they were active all year round, so they did not hibernate through the winter. The structure of these bones also suggests warm-bloodedness, which would help maintain its body heat.

==Classification==

&quot;Qantassaurus&quot; is a basal iguanodont ornithopod that was originally assigned to the Hypsilophodontidae in 1999. Today, this is understood to be an unnatural (paraphyletic) group, and &quot;Qantassaurus&quot; was recently recovered as a basal iguanodont by Boyd (2015), and more specifically as a member of the iguanodontian clade Elasmaria by Rozadilla &quot;et al.&quot; (2016) and Madzia et al. (2017).

In this regard, it is one of four ornithischian species once considered hypsilophodontids from southeast Australia, along with &quot;Leaellynasaura amicagraphica&quot;, &quot;Atlascopcosaurus loadsi&quot;, and &quot;Fulgurotherium australe&quot;. The four taxa are mostly known from isolated bones and teeth; however the thigh bones of &quot;F. australe&quot; are very diverse and may belong to three genera.

==History==

The holotype of &quot;Qantassaurus&quot; was discovered on 27 February 1996, during the third annual field season of the Dinosaur Dreaming project, a dig jointly run by Monash University and the National Museum of Victoria. The dig occurred on the beach of the Bunurong Marine Park at the intertidal site known as Flat Rocks, near Inverloch, in southeastern Victoria, Australia. The rock outcrops at this site are part of the Wonthaggi Formation of the Strzelecki Group, which during the Barremian stage were deposited in floodplains with braided river channels. The holotype specimen, NMV P199075, a fifty-six millimetres long single left dentary of the lower jaw, containing ten teeth (three unerupted), was found by Mrs Nicole Evered, a long time participant of the dig. Two other jaws, specimens NMV P198962, a left dentary, and NMV P199087, a right dentary, found at the same site the same year have also been tentatively associated with, or referred to, the species.

It was named &quot;Qantassaurus intrepidus&quot; by Patricia Vickers-Rich and Tom Rich in 1999, in honor of the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services, which shipped fossils around the country as part of the Great Russian Dinosaurs Exhibit between 1993 and 1996, and sponsored expeditions to South America and Eastern Europe. &quot;QANTAS&quot; is an acronym, which is why a &quot;u&quot; does not follow the &quot;q&quot; in &quot;Qantassaurus&quot;. The specific name means &quot;intrepid&quot; in Latin, referring to the climatic challenges the small dinosaur had to face.

<text>Mott Haven is a primarily residential neighborhood in the southwestern section of the New York City borough of the Bronx. It is generally bounded by East 149th Street to the north, the Bruckner Expressway to the east and south, and the Harlem River to the west, although these boundaries are not precise. East 138th Street is the primary east–west thoroughfare through Mott Haven.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 1, and is located within ZIP Codes 10451, 10454, and 10455. Mott Haven is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 40th Precinct.

The local subway line is the IRT Pelham Line (), operating along East 138th Street. The local buses are the . Mott Haven is served by the Triborough Bridge, the Third Avenue Bridge, the Madison Avenue Bridge, the 145th Street Bridge, and the Willis Avenue Bridge. The closest Metro-North Railroad stops are Harlem – 125th Street and Yankees – East 153rd Street.

== History ==

=== Settlement by Jonas Bronck ===

The Bronx was named after the Swedish sea captain Jonas Bronck. In 1639, the Dutch West India Company purchased the land of today&#x27;s Mott Haven from the Wecquaesgeek (groups of Lenape tribe). Bronck built his farm on this land and named it &quot;Emmanus&quot;. The house was located close to what is today the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street. The peace treaty between Dutch authorities and the Wecquaesgeek chiefs Ranaqua and Tackamuckwas was signed in Bronck&#x27;s house. This event is portrayed in a painting by the American artist John Ward Dunsmore (1856–1945).

Even though Bronck only lived in the area for four years, the land became known as &quot;Broncksland&quot; and the river that bordered his land kept the name Bronck&#x27;s River. The first time the spelling &quot;Bronx land&quot; was used, was in 1697 in the First Legislature outlined the County of West Chester.

=== Development ===
The area that is now called Mott Haven was sold to the Morris family in 1670. A small part of the larger swath of land known as Morrisania, it was purchased by Jordan Lawrence Mott for his iron works in 1849. A vestige of the iron works can be seen just west of the Third Avenue Bridge on East 134th Street. St. Ann&#x27;s Church (ECUSA) on St. Ann&#x27;s Avenue is the resting place of Lewis Morris, Gouverneur Morris and other members of that powerful colonial family, and a Registered Historic Place.

As the city below grew, the area quickly developed residentially. At the same time, an upper-middle class residential area, marked by brownstones built in an elaborate and architecturally daring fashion, started to grow along Alexander Avenue by the 1890s (Doctors&#x27; Row, aka the Irish Fifth Avenue). A series of brownstones on East 134th Street, east of Willis Avenue., was known as Judges&#x27; Row. Soon after, the Bronx grew more quickly, especially with public transit into the area, including the Third Avenue Elevated Line. By the early 20th century, the population density of the area supported the construction of many tenement-style apartment buildings.

From the end of the 19th century through the 1940s, Mott Haven was a mixed German-American (north of East 145th Street) and Irish-American neighborhood (south of East 145th Street), with an Italian enclave west of Lincoln Ave. The first Puerto Rican settlements came in the late 1940s along the length of Brook Avenue. African-Americans came into the area when the Patterson Houses were built.

 It was organized by the veterans of the Irish Republican Army, who marched every Easter Sunday, down Willis Avenue from the Hub to East 138th Street, then west to St. Jerome&#x27;s. The Star of Munster Ballroom at the northeast corner of Willis Avenue and East 138th Street was a center of Irish music for decades. It was speculated at one time that there were more bars on Willis Avenue than on any other city street, given its short length. More recorded Irish musicians lived in Mott Haven than in any place outside Ireland.

=== &quot;South Bronx&quot; and late-20th century ===

Mott Haven and Port Morris were the first neighborhoods to give rise to the term &quot;South Bronx&quot;. Together, they were earlier known as the North Side or North New York. This area was part of New York City after the incorporation of Greater New York in 1898. The Chase Manhattan Bank at Third Avenue and East 137th Street was originally the North Side Board of Trade Building (1912). It later became the North Side Savings Bank, which became the Dollar Dry Dock Savings Bank, which became Chase.

In the 1940s when the Bronx was usually divided into the East Bronx and West Bronx, a group of social workers identified a pocket of poverty on East 134th Street, east of Brown Place, and called it the South Bronx. This area of poverty would spread in part due to an illegal practice known as blockbusting and to Robert Moses building several housing projects in the neighborhood. The poverty greatly expanded northward, following the post-war phenomenon colloquially referred to as white flight, reaching a peak in the 1960s when the socioeconomic North Bronx-South Bronx boundary reached Fordham Road. At this time a wave of arson destroyed or damaged many of the residential, commercial, and industrial structures in the area.

During the course of Mott Haven&#x27;s growth, the communities of Wilton and North New York were incorporated into it. Later attempts to market Mott Haven as the &quot;Piano District&quot; and the South Bronx as &quot;SoBro&quot; have not found traction.

Recent development plans include two affordable rental buildings, a Hampton Inn by Monadnock Development and Signature Urban Properties, and the so-called Piano District.

<doc id="1249286" wikidata="Q30587619" url="?curid=1249286" title="Adjunct professors in North America">
<text>In North America, an adjunct professor, also known as an adjunct lecturer or adjunct instructor (collectively, adjunct faculty), is a professor who teaches on a limited-term contract, often for one semester at a time, and who is ineligible for tenure. 

==Increase in adjunct labor==

Colleges and universities began to employ greater numbers of non-tenure-track faculty in the 1970s. In 1975, adjuncts represented roughly 24% of instructional staff at degree-granting institutions, whereas in 2011 they represented over 40% of instructional staff.

Various explanations have been given for this shift. Some &quot;trace the practice of hiring part-time instructors to a time when most schools didn’t allow women as full professors, and thus adjunct positions were associated with female instructors from the start.&quot; Many non-tenure-track faculty were married to full-time, tenure-track professors, and known as &quot;the housewives of higher education.&quot; The majority of non-tenure-track professors are still women.

Some have argued that the increase in the use of non-tenured faculty is the result of “financial pressures, administrators’ desire for more flexibility in hiring, firing and changing course offerings, and the growth of community colleges and regional public universities focused on teaching basics and preparing students for jobs.” Others have argued that universities hire non-tenure-track faculty to &quot;offset ... administrative bloat with cheaper labor&quot; to the detriment of students: &quot;while college tuition surged from 2003 to 2013 by 94 percent at public institutions and 74 percent at private, nonprofit schools, and student debt has climbed to over $1.2 trillion, much of that money has been going to ensure higher pay for a burgeoning legion of bureaucrats.&quot;

Paying some instructors less than others for the same teaching duties may be illegal.

==Compensation and academic use==
In past decades, adjunct faculty helped universities and colleges expand the range of their course offerings to prospective and existing students. In this respect, adjuncts can also be used to inform the predominantly theoretical, and therefore somewhat limited, focus of full-time academics with the more pragmatic perspective of those who actually practice a given discipline in business, government or nonprofit organizations, akin to a professor of practice. For instance, as of the early 1990s Marvin Kaye, a prolific fiction author, editor and anthologist, also worked as part-time adjunct faculty of creative writing at New York University Another example is Edward H. Shortliffe, a pioneer in medical informatics, who was an adjunct faculty member at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons circa 2011. Marilyn Milian, a retired Florida judge and star of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, taught litigation skills as an adjunct faculty at the University of Miami as of 2013; and musician Wayne Horvitz has worked as adjunct faculty teaching composition at Cornish College of the Arts.

Since the 1980s, however, colleges and universities have increasingly utilized adjunct labor, whether full-time or part-time, simply to save money, giving them core undergraduate courses to teach (e.g., introductory math, or freshman-level English composition).

Though adjuncts hold at least a master&#x27;s degree, if not a PhD, the salary for these positions is relatively low. Many adjuncts must work at several schools at once in order to earn a living in academia. Non-tenure-track faculty earn much less than tenure-track professors; median pay per course is $2,700 and average yearly pay is between $20,000 and $25,000. Adjunct pay in state and community colleges varies; however, it can be as little as US$1,400 for a 3-credit hour lecture-based course. At many private institutions on the East Coast, payment for a 3-credit hour course hovers around US$3,000–4,000, with average pay nationwide as of 2014 estimated at around US$2,000–3,000.

English professor William Pannapacker noted that adjunct faculty often earn less than minimum wage, when factoring in hours spent on classroom teaching, lesson preparation, office hours, grading of assignments, and other duties. 25% of adjuncts receive public assistance. According to the American Federation of Teachers, &quot;nearly 25 percent of adjunct faculty members rely on public assistance, and 40 percent struggle to cover basic household expenses&quot; and &quot;just 15 percent of adjuncts said they are able to comfortably cover basic expenses from month to month.&quot;

Some adjunct faculty have remained with the same employer for as long as 25 years without receiving health insurance or retirement benefits. In 2014, Mary-Faith Cerasoli, a homeless female adjunct professor of Spanish and Italian, conducted a protest on the steps of the New York State Education Department Building.

Groups supporting the efforts of adjuncts to organize for improved wages and working conditions include the Service Employees International Union, the United Steelworkers, and the New Faculty Majority Foundation.

==Unionization efforts==

Increasingly, non-tenure-track faculty are turning to unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the Service Employees International Union, and United Autoworkers, to improve their wages and working conditions. Adjunct faculty have successfully pushed for contracts at American University, Georgetown University, George Washington University, Howard University, Montgomery College, Trinity Washington University, and Loyola University Chicago. At other colleges and universities, such as Boston University, Lesley University, Northeastern University, and Tufts University, adjuncts have voted to unionize.

The American Federation of Teachers has more than 150 adjunct/contingent locals.

AETC is headquartered at Randolph Air Force Base, Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. AETC is the primary training and professional education command in the Air Force.

More than 48,000 active duty and Air Reserve Component members and 14,000 civilian personnel make up AETC. The command has responsibility for approximately 1,600 aircraft.

AETC&#x27;s mission is to &quot;recruit, train and educate Airmen to deliver air power for America.&quot;

==Air Force Recruiting Service==
AETC&#x27;s mission begins with the Air Force Recruiting Service (AFRS), an AETC activity also headquartered at Randolph AFB, Texas. AFRS comprises three regional groups and 24 squadrons with more than 1,400 commissioned officer and enlisted recruiters assigned throughout the United States, including territories Puerto Rico and Guam, as well as foreign counties England, Germany, Japan. Recruiters in more than 1,000 offices worldwide recruit the young men and women needed as both enlisted airmen and commissioned officers to meet the demands of the U.S. Air Force.

AFRS recruitment of commissioned officers is limited to 4-year college/university graduates via Air Force Officer Training School (OTS). Individuals who desire to become commissioned USAF officers and enter the service via the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA) and Air Force ROTC (AFROTC) are not recruited by AFRS and are instead accessed via recruitment and application activities of USAFA and AFROTC, respectively.

==Basic military training and technical training==
Second Air Force (2 AF), with headquarters at Keesler AFB, Mississippi, is responsible for conducting basic military and technical training for Air Force enlisted members and technical training for non-flying missile launch officers, as well as support officers. The first stop for all Regular Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Command enlisted personnel is Basic Military Training (BMT) at Lackland AFB, Texas. More than 36,000 new airmen complete this recently lengthened eight-and-a-half-week program each year.

After completing BMT, airmen begin technical training in their career field specialties, primarily at five installations: Goodfellow AFB, Lackland AFB, and Sheppard AFB in Texas; Keesler AFB, Mississippi; and Vandenberg SFB, California. There are also several cross-service schools such as Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California and the U.S. Army CCBRN School at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri that select USAF enlisted personnel will also attend. A recently established technical training institute at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, also conducts training in several medical career fields. Each base is responsible for a specific portion of formal technical training airmen require to accomplish the Air Force mission. Instructors conduct technical training in specialties such as aircraft maintenance, electronic principles, air transportation, civil engineering, medical services, computer systems, security forces, air traffic control, personnel, intelligence, fire fighting, weather forecasting and space and missile operations.

Commissioned officers not assigned to flight training as prospective pilots, combat systems officers or air battle managers attend technical training courses for similar career fields at the same locations.

2 AF also conducts specialized training for military working dogs and dog handlers at Lackland AFB, Texas, for the entire Department of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration. Additionally, the Inter-American Air Forces Academy at Lackland AFB hosts more than 160 courses in aviation specialties, taught in Spanish, to students from 19 Western hemisphere countries.

==Flying training==
When AETC was established in 1993, Nineteenth Air Force (19 AF) was also established as a companion numbered air force to 2 AF within AETC. While 2 AF focused on ground-based technical training, 19 AF focused on all undergraduate flying training and those formal training units (FTU) under its claimancy from 1993 until 2012, and again from 2014 to present. On 12 July 2012, 19 AF was temporarily inactivated for budgetary reasons in an effort to gain efficiencies. By 2014, these efficiencies had failed to materialize and the then-Commander of AETC, Gen Robin Rand, directed reestablishment of 19 AF effective 1 October 2014 for the oversight of all flight training operations under AETC&#x27;s claimancy.

===Pilot training===
Air Force pilot candidates begin their flying careers with Initial Flight Training (IFT) at Pueblo Memorial Airport, Colorado. In IFT, civilian flight instructors working under contract to AETC and the command&#x27;s 306th Flying Training Group (306 FTG) provide up to 25 hours of flight instruction to commissioned officer and enlisted student pilots accessed via the U.S. Air Force Academy, Air Force ROTC and Air Force OTS.

Following successful completion of IFS, student pilots attend either:

* Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT)
* Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT)

====Primary Training – SUPT====
SUPT students accomplish primary training in the T-6A Texan II at one of three Air Force bases:

* Columbus AFB, Mississippi
* Laughlin AFB, Texas
* Vance AFB, Oklahoma

Between 1994 and 2013, SUPT was titled JSUPT for &quot;Joint Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training&quot; and 100 USAF students annually accomplished primary training in the T-34C Turbomentor and later the T-6B Texan II with Training Air Wing FIVE at Naval Air Station Whiting Field, Florida via a combination of USN, USAF, USMC and USCG flight instructors while 80 USN and 20 USMC students annually accomplished primary training in the T-6A Texan II with the 71st Flying Training Wing at Vance Air Force Base. This program was terminated on 25 July 2013 with the graduation of the final USAF student pilot from primary training at NAS Whiting Field.

====Primary Training – ENJJPT====
ENJJPT students accomplish primary training in the T-6A Texan II at the following location:

* Sheppard AFB, Texas

The entire ENJJPT course lasts about 54 weeks and students learn with, and are taught by, officers of the U.S. Air Force and various European air forces. During the primary phase, students master contact, instrument, low-level and formation flying.

====Advanced Training – Fighter/Bomber (ENJJPT + SUPT)====
After the primary phase of SUPT and ENJJPT, student pilots select one of three advanced training tracks based on their class standing. Those qualified for fighter or bomber assignments are assigned to the fighter/bomber track and train in the T-38 Talon at the SUPT and ENJJPT bases. Following completion of the fighter/bomber track, graduates will be assigned to the A-10, F-15 Eagle, F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16, F-22 and F-35, B-1, B-2 or B-52.

NOTE: &quot;The U-2 is not an option for new graduates of the Fighter/Bomber track. Prospective U-2 pilots must be qualified in another fighter, bomber, reconnaissance or mobility aircraft before applying to fly the U-2. First Assignment Instructor Pilots (FAIPs) are also eligible to apply following their FAIP assignment.&quot;

====Advanced Training – Airlift/Tanker (SUPT only)====
Prospective airlift, tanker and &quot;big wing&quot; reconnaissance and special mission pilots are assigned to the airlift/tanker track and train in the T-1A Jayhawk at SUPT bases only. Following completion of the Airlift/Tanker track, graduates of this track will fly the C-5, C-17, C-21, C-130, AC-130, EC-130, HC-130, LC-130, MC-130, WC-130, KC-135, KC-10, KC-46, E-3, E-8, RC-135 and OC-135.

Prior to mid-2012, some USAF student pilots selected for the airlift/tanker track with specific assignment to the C-130 Hercules or its variants (special operations, electronic warfare, combat rescue, weather reconnaissance, etc.) were assigned to a multi-engine turboprop track flying the T-44 Pegasus and/or TC-12B Huron at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas in a cooperative arrangement between AETC and the Naval Air Training Command / Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA). These USAF students received instruction from a combination of USN, USAF, USMC and USCG flight instructors with Training Air Wing FOUR at NAS Corpus Christi. This program was discontinued in 2012 and all USAF student pilots slated for the C-130 and its variants now train in the T-1A at one of the three SUPT bases.

NOTE: &quot;The 55th Wing&#x27;s (55 WG) E-4B National Air Operations Center (NAOC) aircraft and any of the Special Air Mission (SAM) aircraft operated by the 89th Airlift Wing (89 AW), e.g., VC-25/Air Force One, C-32, C-40, etc., are not options for new graduates of the Airlift/Tanker track. Prospective E-4 and VC-25/C-32/C-40 pilots must be qualified in an airlift, tanker, or other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft before applying to fly the E-4 or any SAM aircraft.&quot;

====Advanced Training – Helicopter (SUPT only)====
Those selected to fly helicopters or tilt-rotor aircraft are assigned after completion of the primary phase to AETC&#x27;s 23d Flying Training Squadron at Fort Novosel, Alabama to train in the TH-1H Huey. Graduates will fly the UH-1N Twin Huey, HH-60G Pave Hawk or CV-22 Osprey.

===Combat Systems Officer Training===
====Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training – UCSOT====

Previously known as Navigators, the training pipeline for Combat Systems Officers has seen significant change since AETC&#x27;s establishment. When AETC was first activated to replace Air Training Command (ATC), it inherited ATC&#x27;s modernization effort of navigator training in the midst of a BRAC-directed closure of Mather AFB, California and the inactivation of its 323d Flying Training Wing, USAF&#x27;s sole Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) wing, which also provided advanced training for USN Student Naval Flight Officers destined for land-based naval aircraft (e.g., P-3 Orion, E-6 Mercury, etc.) under the dual-designation of Interservice Undergraduate Navigator Training (IUNT).
As part of this transition, AETC opted to implement a dual training track whereby most USAF and all land-based USN and NATO/Allied officer student navigator training would transition to the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) at Randolph AFB, Texas utilizing the T45 navigation simulator and flying the T-43 Bobcat (both relocated from Mather AFB) and adding the T-1 Jayhawk for USAF students. The relocated programs were renamed Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training (SUNT) for USAF and USAF-sponsored NATO/Allied students, and Joint Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training (JSUNT) for USN and USN-sponsored NATO/Allied students. USAF students graduating from SUNT were assigned to B-52, C-130, AC-130, EC-130, HC-130, LC-130, MC-130, WC-130, KC-135, E-3, E-8, RC-135 and OC-135 aircraft.

At the same time, a pre-selected cohort of USAF officer student navigators destined as weapon systems officers in the F-15E Strike Eagle, the B-1 Lancer, and, with the retirement of the EF-111 Raven, electronic warfare officers providing USAF manning of joint USN-USAF EA-6B Prowler squadrons, would complete a joint flight training program established between 19 AF and the Naval Air Training Command / Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) with Training Air Wing SIX at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. In this latter program, prospective USAF WSOs and EWOs would follow essentially the same training track as USN and USMC Student Naval Flight Officers destined for tactical fighter, strike and electronic attack aircraft, flying the T-34C Turbomentor in primary training until the T-34C&#x27;s replacement by the T-6 Texan II, USAF T-1 Jayhawk aircraft on detached operations at NAS Pensacola, and USN/USMC T-39 Sabreliner aircraft in intermediate and advanced training under the tutelage of USN, USAF and USMC instructors.

In 2009, with the transition of all USAF Navigators to Combat Systems Officers, the merger of SUNT into Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training (UCSOT), and pursuant to additional BRAC directives, the 12 FTW established the 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG) with two flying training squadrons and an operations support squadron as a geographically-separated unit (GSU) at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.

Pursuant to USAF policy changes, AETC and CNATRA also discontinued joint training at Training Air Wing SIX with the establishment of the 479 FTG. Although NAS Pensacola remains the principal base for Student Naval Flight Officer (SNFO) training for the U.S. Navy, the 479 FTG operates independently of this program with its own USAF T-6 Texan II and T-1 Jayhawk aircraft. Upon establishment of the 479 FTG at NAS Pensacola, the remaining &quot;legacy&quot; navigator training squadrons that had relocated from the former Mather AFB to Randolph AFB in 1992 were inactivated and the remaining T-43 Bobcat aircraft retired.

Starting in the summer of 2010, following completion of Initial Flight Screening (IFS) at Pueblo Memorial Airport, Colorado with their USAF student pilot counterparts, all USAF CSO students undergo Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training (UCSOT) with the 479 FTG. Merging the three previous USAF Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) tracks formerly known as Navigator track, Weapon Systems Officer (WSO) track and Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) track into one coherent training cycle, the first UCSOT class (11-01) under the new syllabus commenced training on 5 May 2010 and graduated on 15 April 2011. Today, USAF CSOs continue to fill all of the previously mentioned multi-place USAF combat aircraft with the exception that the USN has since retired all of its EA-6B Prowlers and the USAF now provides a few CSOs to four of the USN&#x27;s thirteen Electronic Attack Squadrons flying the EA-18G Growler. Those four squadrons are land based and do not deploy aboard aircraft carriers.

===Air Battle Manager Training===
Air Battle Managers (ABM) are aircrew who operate mission systems in the E-3 Sentry &quot;AWACS&quot; and E-8 J-STARS and operate the ground based Control and Reporting Centers. Since October 1999, they have been considered &quot;Aeronautically Rated Officers&quot; on par with USAF pilots and CSOs. ABMs complete Undergraduate Air Battle Manager Training (UABMT) under AETC cognizance at Tyndall AFB, Florida that consists of a 6-9 month training syllabus with topics ranging from Radar Theory, Basic Aviation, The Continuum of Control (Close Control, Tactical Fluid Control, Broadcast Control, Advisory and Autonomous Control), Red Air (adversary aircraft capabilities) and Blue Air (joint and coalition aircraft capabilities) Academics, Electro-Magnetic Spectrum Academics, Air to Ground combat simulator, Large Force Employment simulators and culminating with live Air to Air control with Fighter Squadrons along the East Coast/Gulf of Mexico. The syllabus also includes 6 training sorties in the MU-2 Peacock. As of May 2010, a new training syllabus at Tyndall AFB allows ABMs to receive their wings at the conclusion of UABMT, finally bringing their undergraduate flight training in line with pilots and CSOs. Follow-on simulator and flying training in the E-3 or E-8 aircraft takes place under the cognizance of Air Combat Command at Tinker AFB, Oklahoma with the 966th Airborne Air Control Squadron and Robins AFB, Georgia, with the 330 Combat Training Squadron respectively. ABMs also receive their follow on simulator and live control training for the CRC at Luke AFB, AZ with the 607th Air Control Squadron.

===Enlisted Aircrew Training===
AETC also provides enlisted aircrew training for a wide variety of aircrew specialties including flight engineers, air-to-air refueling boom operators, loadmasters, aerial gunners, and airborne communications specialists as follows:

* Flight engineers, loadmasters, other aircrew (C-130, EC-130, LC-130, WC-130) – Little Rock AFB
* Flight engineers, loadmasters, other aircrew (AC-130, MC-130, HC-130) – Little Rock AFB and Kirtland AFB
* Flight engineers, aerial gunners, other aircrew (CV-22, HH-60, UH-1) – Kirtland AFB
* Aerial refueling boom operators (KC-10, KC-46, KC-135) – Altus AFB
* Loadmasters (C-5) – Lackland AFB / Kelly Field Annex
* Loadmasters (C-17) – Altus AFB
* Airborne communications specialists (various aircraft) – Lackland AFB
* RPA Sensor Operator – Randolph AFB

===Formal Training Unit===
Air Education and Training Command also provides follow-on training for most Air Force pilots, CSOs and enlisted aircrew in their assigned aircraft via Formal Training Units (FTUs). For those pilots and CSOs selected for assignment to fighter aircraft, they will complete the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) course, an AETC-administered program, at Randolph AFB, Texas, Columbus AFB, Mississippi, or Sheppard AFB, Texas, shortly following completion of undergraduate flying training and prior to reporting to their FTU. At IFF, pilots fly the AT-38B Talon.

==Air University==
Air University (AU), headquartered at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, conducts professional military education (PME), graduate education and professional continuing education for officers, senior enlisted members and DoD and DAFC civilians throughout their careers.

===USAF Commissioned Officer Accession &amp; Training===
Air University also has responsibility for all Air Force officer accession and training other than those officers accessed and commissioned the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA). This is conducted via AU&#x27;s subordinate activity, the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development (Holm Center), formerly the Air Force Officer Accession and Training Schools (AFOATS).

As an AU activity, the Holm Center oversees both the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC), with detachments at numerous colleges and universities across the United States, and the Air Force Officer Training School (OTS) at Maxwell AFB, Alabama.

===Professional Military Education (PME) and Graduate and Continuing Education===
Air University&#x27;s professional military education schools prepare students from the Air Force, its sister services and both NATO and other U.S.-allied nations as they progress through their careers. Emphasis in these programs includes leadership, military doctrine and air power.

The three primary PME schools are:
* Squadron Officer School (SOS), an approximately two-month leadership development program primarily for USAF company grade officers (First Lieutenants (O-2) and Captains (O-3)); attendance is also open to US civil service (primarily DAFC) in grades GS-11 and GS-12
* Air Command and Staff College (ACSC), an approximately year long joint &quot;intermediate&quot; service college program for officers of all services in the rank of (or selected for) Major (O-4), Lieutenant Commander (O-4) in the Navy and Coast Guard, other Allied military equivalents, or US civil service GS-13, primarily DAFC, DoD, DHS and NASA
* USAF Air War College (AWC), an approximately year long joint &quot;senior&quot; service college program for officers in the rank of (or selected for) Lieutenant Colonel (O-5), Commander (O-5) in the Navy and Coast Guard, other Allied military equivalents, or US civil service GS-14. Officers in the grade of Colonel (O-6), Captain (O-6) in the Navy and Coast Guard, and US civil service GS-15 (primarily DAFC, DoD, DHS and NASA) may also attend AWC in residence, although this is usually due to previous completion of AWC via correspondence or seminar, career timing, or early promotion.
Air University oversees the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), the Air Force&#x27;s primary institution for graduate and continuing education. Approximately 700 full-time students, most of whom are Air Force and Space Force officers, pursue both master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees through the institute&#x27;s Graduate School of Education and Management. The School of Systems and Logistics, the Civil Engineer School, and the School of Strategic Force Studies provides opportunities for acquisition management, logistics management, civil engineering, and nuclear and cyber professional and continuing education.

===Air Force Junior ROTC===
Air University also oversees one of Air Force&#x27;s two civilian participatory programs, Air Force Junior ROTC. Civil Air Patrol was moved under Air Combat Command in 2016:

* The Air Force Junior ROTC program is a cadet program for high school students at more than 870 high schools in the United States and at Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS) locations overseas. AFJROTC Instructors are retired USAF officers in the ranks of Major, Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel, assisted by retired USAF non-commissioned officers in the ranks of Technical Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant.
** As opposed to its college/university counterpart, Air Force ROTC (AFROTC), the AFJROTC program is not a military pre-commissioning program for prospective USAF officers, but is instead a citizenship program for youth similar to, but with an overall narrower age range than, the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program.

AFJROTC are subordinate to the Jeanne M. Holm Center for Officer Accessions and Citizen Development (Holm Center).

Other academic support services at Air University include the Academic Instructor School, the Air Force Public Affairs Center of Excellence, the Muir S. Fairchild Research Information Center (formerly known as Air University Library) and the International Officer School.

==History==
&quot;For a history prior to 1993, see Air Training Command&quot;

On 1 January 1993, Air Training Command absorbed Air University and changed the command designation to Air Education and Training Command (AETC). AETC assumed responsibilities for both aspects of career development: training and education. Missions such as combat crew training, pararescue, and combat controller training, and (later) space training transferred to the new command, so that airmen would report to their operational units mission ready.

Restructuring the command assumed priority among the issues facing the command staff. The introduction of three new training aircraft, the Raytheon T-1 Jayhawk, Slingsby T-3 Firefly, and Beech T-6 Texan II (JPATS); the addition of joint training; and the BRAC-mandated closures of Chanute AFB, Illinois (a major technical training center); Mather AFB, California (previously USAF&#x27;s sole Undergraduate Navigator Training base) and Williams AFB, Arizona (an Undergraduate Pilot Training base) were major challenges following the establishment of AETC.

In 1994, AETC adopted the Objective Wing Concept and stood up several wings responsible for crew training in the F-16, special operations aircraft, airlift aircraft, the KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft, and space and missile operations. AETC also began the first Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) and Joint-SUPT courses.

Lowry AFB, Colorado, a technical training center with closed runways that, like the previously closed Chanute AFB, no longer conducted flight operations but conducted both non-flying officer and enlisted technical training, was added to the list of AETC bases closed by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) in the mid-1990s. This was followed by the BRAC mandated closure of Reese AFB, Texas, an Undergraduate Pilot Training base, in 1995. The transition to SUPT was completed in 1996, the delivery of the first JPATS aircraft in 1999, and the discontinuation of the controversial T-3 as an initial flight screening aircraft in 2000 following a higher than average fatal mishap record.

In response to the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, AETC went on a war footing, activating a Crisis Action Team and supplying both fighters and tankers from its wings for combat air patrols in American airspace as part of Operation Noble Eagle. An operational test and evaluation of JPATS began in 2002 at Moody AFB and upgrades to its Training Integration Management System (TIMS) were begun the next year, resulting in retirement of the T-37 Tweet and full implementation of JPATS with the T-6 Texan II in 2007.

<text>Nenets (in former work also Yurak) is a pair of closely related languages spoken in northern Russia by the Nenets people. They are often treated as being two dialects of the same language, but they are very different and mutual intelligibility is low. The languages are Tundra Nenets, which has a higher number of speakers, spoken by some 30,000 to 40,000 people in an area stretching from the Kanin Peninsula to the Yenisei River, and Forest Nenets, spoken by 1,000 to 1,500 people in the area around the Agan, Pur, Lyamin and Nadym rivers.

The Nenets languages are classified in the Uralic language family, making them distantly related to some national languages spoken in Europe – namely Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian – in addition to other minority languages spoken in Russia. Both of the Nenets languages have been greatly influenced by Russian. Tundra Nenets has, to a lesser degree, been influenced by Komi and Northern Khanty. Forest Nenets has also been influenced by Eastern Khanty. Tundra Nenets is well documented, considering its status as an indigenous and minority language. It has a literary tradition going back to the 1930s, while Forest Nenets was first written during the 1990s and has been little documented.

Apart from the word &#x27;Nenets&#x27;, only one other Nenets word has entered the English language: &#x27;parka&#x27;, their traditional long, hooded jacket, made from skins and sometimes fur.

== Common features of Nenets languages ==
Tundra Nenets has 16 moods, most of which reflect different degrees of certainty in what in English might be called indicative statements or different degrees of force in what in English might be called imperative commands. An overarching feature of the Nenets languages is the introduction of systematic palatalization of almost all consonants. This originates from contrasts between different vowel qualities in the Proto-Samoyedic language.
* *Cä, *Ca → *Cʲa, *Ca
* *Ce, *Cë → *Cʲe, *Ce
* *Ci, *Cï → *Cʲi, *Ci
* *Cö, *Co → *Cʲo, *Co
* *Cü, *Cu → *Cʲu, *Cu
The velar consonants *k and *ŋ were additionally shifted to *sʲ and *nʲ when palatalized.

Similar changes have also occurred in the other Samoyedic languages spoken in the tundra zone: Enets, Nganasan and the extinct Yurats.

== Differences between Tundra and Forest Nenets ==

Tundra Nenets generally has remained closer to Proto-Nenets than Forest Nenets, whose phonology has been influenced by eastern Khanty dialects. Changes towards the modern languages include:
* Tundra Nenets:
** Delabialization of /wʲ/ → /j/
** Lenition of initial /k/ → /x/
** Simplification of /ʔk/ → /k/
* Forest Nenets:
** Initial /s/ → /x/
** Medial denasalization of /nʲ/ → /j/
** The change of rhotics to lateral fricatives: /r/, /rʲ/ → /ɬ/, /ɬʲ/
** Shortening of geminate nasals
** Breaking of geminate /lː/ → /nɬ/
** Phonemicization of palatalized velars /kʲ/, /xʲ/, /ŋʲ/ due to vowel changes
** Raising of non-close vowels preceding a syllable with an original close vowel
** Loss of vowel distinctions in unstressed syllables
** Introduction of short/long contrasts for /a/ and /æ/

<text>In cryptography, nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers are any numbers which, by their construction, are above suspicion of hidden properties. They are used in creating cryptographic functions such as hashes and ciphers. These algorithms often need randomized constants for mixing or initialization purposes. The cryptographer may wish to pick these values in a way that demonstrates the constants were not selected for a nefarious purpose, for example, to create a backdoor to the algorithm. These fears can be allayed by using numbers created in a way that leaves little room for adjustment. An example would be the use of initial digits from the number  as the constants. Using digits of millions of places after the decimal point would not be considered trustworthy because the algorithm designer might have selected that starting point because it created a secret weakness the designer could later exploit—though even with natural-seeming selections, enough entropy exists in the possible choices that the utility of these numbers has been questioned.

Digits in the positional representations of real numbers such as , &quot;e&quot;, and irrational roots are believed to appear with equal frequency (see normal number). Such numbers can be viewed as the opposite extreme of Chaitin–Kolmogorov random numbers in that they appear random but have very low information entropy. Their use is motivated by early controversy over the U.S. Government&#x27;s 1975 Data Encryption Standard, which came under criticism because no explanation was supplied for the constants used in its S-box (though they were later found to have been carefully selected to protect against the then-classified technique of differential cryptanalysis). Thus a need was felt for a more transparent way to generate constants used in cryptography.
&quot;Nothing up my sleeve&quot; is a phrase associated with magicians, who sometimes preface a magic trick by holding open their sleeves to show they have no objects hidden inside.

==Examples==
* Ron Rivest used pi to generate the S-box of the MD2 hash.
* Ron Rivest used the trigonometric sine function to generate constants for the widely used MD5 hash.
* The U.S. National Security Agency used the square roots of the first eight prime integers to produce the hash constants in their &quot;Secure Hash Algorithm&quot; functions, SHA-1 and SHA-2. SHA-1 also uses 0123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA9876543210F0E1D2C3 as its initial hash value.
* The Blowfish encryption algorithm uses the binary representation of − 3 to initialize its key schedule.
* RFC 3526 describes prime numbers for internet key exchange that are also generated from .
* The S-box of the NewDES cipher is derived from the United States Declaration of Independence.
* The AES candidate DFC derives all of its arbitrary constants, including all entries of the S-box, from the binary expansion of .
* The ARIA key schedule uses the binary expansion of 1/.
* The key schedule of the RC5 cipher uses binary digits from both and the golden ratio.
* Multiple ciphers including TEA and Red Pike use 2654435769 or 0x9e3779b9 which is , where is the golden ratio.
* The BLAKE hash function, a finalist in the SHA-3 competition, uses a table of 16 constant words which are the leading 512 or 1024 bits of the fractional part of .
* The key schedule of the KASUMI cipher uses 0x123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA9876543210 to derive the modified key.
* The Salsa20 family of ciphers use the ASCII string &quot;expand 32-byte k&quot; or &quot;expand 16-byte k&quot; as constants in its block initialization process.
* Bcrypt uses the string &quot;OrpheanBeholderScryDoubt&quot; as an initialization string

==Counterexamples==
*The Streebog hash function S-box was claimed to be generated randomly, but was reverse-engineered and proven to be generated algorithmically with some &quot;puzzling&quot; weaknesses.
*The Data Encryption Standard (DES) has constants that were given out by NSA. They turned out to be far from random, but instead made the algorithm resilient against differential cryptanalysis, a method not publicly known at the time.
* Dual_EC_DRBG, a NIST-recommended cryptographic pseudo-random bit generator, came under criticism in 2007 because constants recommended for use in the algorithm could have been selected in a way that would permit their author to predict future outputs given a sample of past generated values. In September 2013 &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;internal memos leaked by a former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, suggest that the NSA generated one of the random number generators used in a 2006 NIST standard—called the Dual EC DRBG standard—which contains a back door for the NSA.&quot;
* P curves are standardized by NIST for elliptic curve cryptography. The coefficients in these curves are generated by hashing unexplained random seeds, such as:
** P-224: codice_1.
** P-256: codice_2.
** P-384: codice_3.
Although not directly related, after the backdoor in Dual_EC_DRBG had been exposed, suspicious aspects of the NIST&#x27;s P curve constants led to concerns that the NSA had chosen values that gave them an advantage in finding private keys. Since then, many protocols and programs started to use Curve25519 as an alternative to NIST P-256 curve.

==Limitations==
Bernstein and coauthors demonstrate that use of nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers as the starting point in a complex procedure for generating cryptographic objects, such as elliptic curves, may not be sufficient to prevent insertion of back doors. For example, many candidates of seemingly harmless and &quot;uninteresting&quot; simple mathematical constants exist, such as π, e, Euler gamma, √2, √3, √5, √7, log(2), (1 + √5)/2, ζ(3), ζ(5), sin(1), sin(2), cos(1), cos(2), tan(1), or tan(2). For these constants, there also exists several different binary representations to choose. If a constant is used as a random seed, a large number of hash function candidates also exist for selection, such as SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/256, SHA3-256, or SHA3-384.

If there are enough adjustable parameters in the object selection procedure, combinatorial explosion ensures that the universe of possible design choices and of apparently simple constants can be large enough so that an automatic search of the possibilities allows construction of an object with desired backdoor properties.

<text>Bobby Rhine (April 18, 1976 – September 5, 2011) was an American soccer player who last played for FC Dallas of Major League Soccer.

Rhine played college soccer at the University of Connecticut from 1994 to 1998. In 1997, he redshirted his senior season in order to complete his master&#x27;s degree requirements. In 1998, he returned for his last season, earning second-team All-American recognition. In February 1999, the Dallas Burn selected Rhine in the first round (sixth overall) in the 1999 MLS College Draft. During his Dallas career, Rhine filled a variety of positions as an on-and-off starter, usually playing up front or in the midfield. His versatility even led to a switch to defense for the 2005 season. His best season came in 2002, when he scored seven goals and six assists and added another goal in the playoffs. In eight MLS seasons, Rhine&#x27;s regular-season totals stand at 23 goals and 33 assists. In 1999, he went on loan to the Milwaukee Rampage of the USL A-League. In 2000, he played one game on loan with the Tennessee Rhythm. Rhine played his final career game against Los Angeles Galaxy on October 26, 2008, a game in which normal team captain Duilio Davino insisted Rhine take the captain&#x27;s armband.

Rhine retired at the end of the 2008 season. Upon retiring, he accepted the position of Manager of Community Development with the FC Dallas front office. In addition, Rhine also worked as the color commentator for the team&#x27;s television broadcasts.

On September 5, 2011, while vacationing with his family in Florida, Rhine died from a sudden heart attack at the age of 35.

<doc id="1249313" wikidata="Q233823" url="?curid=1249313" title="Barbara Radziwiłł">
<text>Barbara Radziwiłł (, ; 6 December 1520/23 – 8 May 1551) was Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania as consort of Sigismund II Augustus, the last male monarch of the Jagiellon dynasty. Barbara, a great beauty and already widowed, became a royal mistress most likely in 1543 and they married in secret in July or August 1547. The marriage caused a scandal; it was vehemently opposed by Polish nobles, including Queen mother Bona Sforza. Sigismund Augustus, assisted by Barbara&#x27;s cousin Mikołaj Radziwiłł the Black and brother Mikołaj Radziwiłł the Red, worked tirelessly to gain recognition of their marriage and to crown Barbara as Queen of Poland. They succeeded and Barbara&#x27;s coronation was held on 7 December 1550 at Wawel Cathedral. However, her health was already failing and she died just five months later. Even though it was brief, her reign propelled the Radziwiłł family to new heights of political power and influence.

Her contemporaries generally viewed Barbara in a negative light, accusing her of promiscuity and witchcraft. Her life became surrounded by many rumors and myths. She was a heroine of many legends in a wide range of literary works. From the 18th century, the life of Barbara became romanticized as the great tragic love affair. It has been used as an example of &quot;love conquers all&quot; with Bona Sforza often acting as the chief villain. It caught public imagination and has inspired many artists to create poems, plays, films, and other works. That made Barbara Radziwiłł one of the best known and most recognized women in the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Kingdom of Poland.

== Marriage to Stanislovas Goštautas==
Barbara was the youngest child of Jerzy Radziwiłł, Voivode of Trakai and Vilnius and Great Lithuanian Hetman, and his wife Barbara Kolanka, daughter of Voivode of Podolia. Her exact birth date is unknown. It is known that she was born on 6 December, but the year is not known. Historians usually provide either 1520, as recorded in Radziwiłł genealogy found in Nesvizh, or 1523, as recorded on a plaque found in her tomb. Details of her education are unknown, but it is unlikely that it was extensive. From her correspondence, it is known that she could speak and write in Polish. From a February 1549 letter, it could be inferred that she understood at least some Latin, but her letters to Sigismund Augustus had not a single Latin phrase. According to her contemporaries, Barbara was very beautiful. Moreover, Barbara had an interest in fashion and cosmetics; she used perfumes and face powder.

In 1536, Stanislovas Goštautas, Voivode of Nowogrodek, canceled his betrothal to Anna Elżbieta Radziwiłł, elder sister of Barbara. Jerzy Radziwiłł then offered the hand of Barbara even though it was against custom for a younger sister to wed first. The wedding treaty was signed on 20 October 1536 in Radun. Another plan to wed either Anna Elżbieta or Barbara to Ilia Ostrogski, the only son of Great Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski, fell through. The wedding of Barbara and Stanislovas Goštautas took place on 18 May 1537 in Goštautas&#x27; residence in Hieraniony. Her dowry included numerous silver and gilded tableware items, 24 fine horses, dresses of satin and damask decorated with gold and precious stones. In exchange, Stanislovas transferred property worth 8,000 kopas of Lithuanian groschens to Barbara. Their marriage was childless. Stanislovas died unexpectedly after a brief illness on 18 December 1542.

==Marriage to Sigismund Augustus==

===Love affair and secret marriage===

Stanislovas Goštautas was the last male member of the Goštautai family and, according to law regarding childless widows, the majority of his possessions were inherited by Sigismund I the Old, Grand Duke of Lithuania. On 15 June 1543, Sigismund transferred the property to his son Sigismund II Augustus who visited Hieraniony in October 1543 to take over the estate. It is likely that it was when Barbara and Sigismund Augustus became lovers, though there is no evidence of the affair until after the death of Sigismund Augustus&#x27; first wife.

In July 1544, Sigismund Augustus traveled to Brest and returned with his wife Elizabeth of Austria in October to Vilnius, where Barbara resided with her mother. On 15 June 1545, Elizabeth died from epileptic seizures. Sigismund Augustus and Barbara were free to enjoy each other&#x27;s company – rumors spread about their romantic rendezvous, hunts, and parties. Sigismund Augustus spent 223 days in 1546 hunting. It was said that Sigismund Augustus ordered construction of a secret tunnel connecting the Royal Palace with the nearby Radziwiłł Palace so that the couple could meet frequently and discreetly. At the same time, Sigismund Augustus and his parents searched for a new bride. Sigismund I the Old contemplated a marriage to Anna Sophia, daughter of Albert, Duke of Prussia. Other candidates included Anna d&#x27;Este of Duchy of Ferrara, widowed Anna of Lorraine, Princesses Mary I of England and Margaret of France.
Sometime in 1547, Sigismund Augustus and Barbara wed in secret. Neither exact date nor circumstances are known. The Lithuanian Chronicles recorded the doubtful claim that Sigismund Augustus was forced into the marriage when he was caught with Barbara by the Radziwiłł cousins. According to research by Władysław Pociecha, the wedding probably took place between 26 July and 6 August. Her cousin Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; Radziwiłł was sent to Kraków to inform the Polish court that Sigismund Augustus and Barbara were married since 25 November 1545. It seems he failed the assignment and Sigismund Augustus had to travel to Poland himself. He departed Vilnius on 15 November; Barbara was sent to the Radziwiłł estate in Dubingiai. In a letter dated 20 November, courtier Stanisław Dowojno, starosta of Merkinė, informed Sigismund Augustus that due to the difficult journey Barbara had a miscarriage. If that indeed was true, and not an elaborate intrigue by the Radziwiłłs, it would explain the secret marriage – an attempt to provide legitimacy to the child. However, it appears more likely that Barbara became pregnant after the wedding, as loss of a child appear to be early in the potential pregnancy. Another explanation could be that the bleeding was caused by a rupture of an internal abscess, an early sign of her terminal illness.

===Political struggle for recognition===
Sigismund Augustus informed his parents of the marriage on 2 February 1548 in Piotrków Trybunalski. The news caused an uproar among Polish nobles as Sigismund Augustus wed without the approval of the Senate. What was worse, Barbara was his subject and lover. Queen mother Bona Sforza was one of the most vocal opponents. In the ensuing campaign against recognizing the marriage, Barbara was widely accused of promiscuous behavior and of using witchcraft or poison to seduce Sigismund Augustus. Various authors, including Stanisław Orzechowski and Mikołaj Rej, published and distributed various derogatory pamphlets. The charge of promiscuity often enters works of modern historians though it is not based on any actual evidence. Lithuanian nobles did not openly protest the marriage, but were distrustful of the Radziwiłłs and their rise to power.

King Sigismund I the Old died on 1 April 1548. Sigismund Augustus, who briefly returned to Vilnius, had to travel back to Kraków to attend the funeral and secure himself on the Polish throne. Before he left, King publicly announced his marriage and proclaimed his wife the Queen of Poland on 17 April 1548. During her husband&#x27;s absence, Barbara stayed in Vilnius, in royal castle. In may she informed him in letter that she is pregnant again; she either was mistaken or pregnancy ended in miscarriage, as Queen briefly fell ill around this time. Since it is known only from Radziwiłł reports, there was also proposed that baby was another intrigue to influence the King. In September 1548, Sigismund Augustus invited Barbara to Poland to show the strength of their marriage. The issue was discussed by the general sejm on 31 October – 12 December in Piotrków Trybunalski. The sessions were loud and rowdy. The nobles, including voivodes Piotr Kmita Sobieński, Jan Gabriel Tęczyński, and Piotr Boratyński, pleaded the King to abandon the marriage and even threatened to take up arms. Sigismund Augustus steadfastly refused and stood by his wife; reportedly he even considered abdication. The sejm ended in a stalemate.

After the sejm, Sigismund and Barbara entered Kraków on 13 February 1549. In Wawel, Barbara enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle and expensive gifts. In May 1549, she received large territories in the Trakai Voivodeship, including Kaunas Castle, Rumšiškės, Alytus, Merkinė, Nemunaitis, Birštonas, Žiežmariai, Stakliškės, Karmėlava, Vilkija, Skirsnemunė, Veliuona, Darsūniškis. While she had immense influence on Sigismund Augustus, she showed no interest in politics unlike her ambitious cousin Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; Radziwiłł and brother Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; Radziwiłł. While they worked with her husband to secure her the Polish crown, she made no gestures to win support from the nobles or favor from the people. When a compromise solution was offered – recognize Barbara as Sigismund Augustus&#x27; wife but not to crown her as Queen of Poland – Sigismund Augustus refused because that would cast a doubt on legitimacy of any future children. In summer 1549, to protect himself from a possible armed rebellion, Sigismund Augustus concluded an alliance with Ferdinand, King of Hungary, leaving his sister Isabella Jagiellon to fend for herself in the succession disputes in the Kingdom of Hungary. To obtain papal brief allowing Barbara&#x27;s coronation, Sigismund Augustus issued an edict prohibiting heresy – a controversial move in a country that had many Eastern Orthodox believers in the east. He also worked to threaten, bribe, or otherwise persuade Polish nobles not to oppose the marriage. His mother and one of the most vocal opponents, dowager Queen Bona Sforza, was removed from the court and moved to Mazovia.

===Illness and death===
At the next sejm in May–July 1550, no one objected to the marriage. Therefore, while neither the sejm nor the senate gave an express permission, Barbara was crowned as Queen of Poland on 7 December 1550 in Wawel Cathedral by Mikołaj Dzierzgowski, Archbishop of Gniezno. However, her reign lasted only five months. Almost since her wedding in 1547, she complained of poor health, particularly of stomach pain or &quot;internal stones&quot;. After the coronation her health took a turn for worse. She had fever, stomach pain, lost appetite. A lump appeared on her stomach full of pus. Sigismund Augustus asked to send women healers, including a Jewish woman, from Lithuania.

In March 1551, her condition improved somewhat and she was able to receive a messenger from Bona Sforza who informed her that Bona recognized her marriage to Sigismund Augustus. It was described as her last victory. Her health continued to decline and she had fever, diarrhea, nausea. Sigismund Augustus personally tended to his sick wife even though reportedly she stank of pus. He wanted to take her to Niepołomice where he hoped that spring weather would lessen her suffering. When there was a doubt whether a special wagon to transport Barbara could fit through the city gates, Sigismund Augustus ordered the gate demolished. Barbara died on 8 May 1551 in Kraków. She asked to be buried in Vilnius and her body was transported to Vilnius Cathedral, where she was buried on 23 June next to Sigismund Augustus&#x27; first wife Elizabeth of Austria. Her death was a severe loss to the King; it is said that for a good portion of the journey he followed her coffin on foot. It was said that Sigismund Augustus became more serious, avoided parties, and liked to dress black for the rest of his life.

The cause of her illness has been debated by contemporaries and historians. Secretary of Giovanni Francesco Commendone claimed that her illness was caused by her use of medications that were supposed to help to conceive a child. Radziwiłłs in their letters debated whether she had a sexually transmitted disease. There were persistent rumors that she was poisoned by Bona Sforza. Modern historians tend to think it was cervical or ovarian cancer.

==Physical remains==

Her remains were found in Vilnius Cathedral after a flood in 1931. To preserve her body during the long summer trip from Kraków to Vilnius, it was covered in a mixture of ash and burnt lime. While the wooden coffin rotted away, the lime hardened and formed a protective shell that preserved her bones rather well. She was buried with regal symbols (silver gilded crown, silver scepter, golden orb with a cross) and jewelry (long gold necklace, three gold rings; one of them, gifted to her by Sigismund Augustus, was covered with black vitreous enamel and had three stones – brilliant, ruby, and emerald). These and other artifacts were kept at Vilnius Cathedral, and went missing during World War II. They were rediscovered in cathedral crypt on 16 December 2024.

Her skeleton was cleaned, conserved, and glued together by Michał Reicher and Witold Sylwanowicz, professors at Stefan Batory University. They calculated her height at , which was rather tall for her times. Her teeth were white and straight; her body was slim; her face and nose were narrow. They also noted anatomical abnormalities – a cervical (extra) rib and particularly flat sacrum, which could indicate rickets, but the rest of her skeleton showed no signs of the disease. However, they were unable to complete their monograph on the subject due to World War II. Barbara&#x27;s remains were moved to a crypt under the Chapel of Saint Casimir and remained untouched until 2001. Her height was recalculated at . Using methods developed by Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov, Vytautas Urbanavičius reconstructed her facial features and revealed that she had an aquiline nose, a feature absent from her portraits.

==Personal correspondence==
In total, there are 53 surviving letters from Barbara. 44 of them were published by Alexander Przezdziecki in &quot;Jagiellonki polskie x XVI wieku&quot; (1868). They are addressed to her family (41 letters to her brother Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; Radziwiłł, two letters to her nephews, one letter to her father Jerzy Radziwiłł, one letter to her mother Barbara Kolanka), her husband (8 letters), and Albert, Duke of Prussia (one letter in Latin). It is known that she wrote many more letters to a wider circle of recipients, including Polish nobles and Isabella Jagiellon of Hungary. The surviving letters do not represent actual number or frequency: Sigismund Augustus in his last will asked his sister Anna Jagiellon to destroy his personal correspondence, while Mikołaj &quot;the Red&quot; Radziwiłł was particularly careful to preserve all his correspondence. 52 letters are in Polish (15 of them written by Barbara herself; the rest were written by her secretary Stanisław Koszutski).

Her eight letters to Sigismund Augustus, all written between November 1547 and March 1548 from Dubingiai, are the only surviving love letters of the period. However, they are formulaic and use flowery language. Above all, her letters show her humility and subservience to her husband. Barbara habitually refers to herself as his most humble and smallest servant. She inquires about his health, thanks him for any sign of his good grace and favor, asks him not to forget her. Letters written to others, particularly those by her secretary, are similarly standard though she manages to include more honest and warm greetings and wishes. Initially, Sigismund Augustus lectured her on the proper use of the royal &quot;we&quot; after she sent letters with singular &quot;I&quot;. She rarely writes about herself or politics. She often inquired about the recipients&#x27; health and wished them good health, trusting God and His good grace. Her correspondence with her brother was controlled by Sigismund Augustus; therefore she wrote several letters to him in secret from her husband.

==In popular culture==

Barbara&#x27;s life and death have inspired legends, paintings, literary works and film. The popular legend of Pan Twardowski has that Faust-like figure summoning Barbara&#x27;s ghost for King Sigismund August. In 1817 Alojzy Feliński wrote a tragedy, and in 1858 Antoni Edward Odyniec a drama, &quot;Barbara Radziwiłłówna&quot;. A 19th-century lithograph by Michał Kulesza depicting her with pearls is considered among the painter&#x27;s notable works.

In 1936 director Józef Lejtes directed the film &quot;Barbara Radziwiłłówna&quot; starring Witold Zacharewicz as the King Sigismund and Jadwiga Smosarska as Barbrara. The film gained international fame and recognition during Venice and Cannes film festivals.

In 1983 Janusz Majewski directed a film, &quot;Epitafium dla Barbary Radziwiłłówny&quot; (Epitaph for Barbara Radziwiłł) about Barbara&#x27;s romance with King Sigismund August, her death and her posthumous return to Vilnius. Anna Dymna starred as Barbara, and Jerzy Zelnik as King Sigismund August. Barbara has also appeared as a major character in &quot;Królowa Bona&quot; (Queen Bona), TV series on Telewizja Polska.

In Lithuania, two plays &quot;Barbora Radvilaitė&quot; were written, by Balys Sruoga in 1946 (unfinished) and Juozas Grušas in 1972. The latter was staged by the Kaunas State Drama Theater and directed by Jonas Jurašas. It was also turned into a film, directed by Vidmantas Bačiulis, in 1982. In 2012, musical &quot;Žygimanto Augusto ir Barboros Radvilaitės legenda&quot; by Anželika Cholina was described as the biggest and most expensive in Lithuania.

The story of Barbara Radziwiłł served as an inspiration for the title track from the 2013 album &quot;Czornaja Panna&quot; by the Belarusian folkmetal band Litvintroll, a lyrical account of Sigismund&#x27;s pain and grief after Barbara&#x27;s death. The band claims the song not only to have given the name to the album but also to have &quot;set its whole outline.&quot;

On 6 October 2018, a musical titled &quot;The Legend of Zygimantas Augustas and Barbora Radvilaite,&quot; was performed at the Auditorium Theater in Chicago. The musical was directed and choreographed by Anzelika Cholina, composed by Mantas Jankavicius, and the libretto was authored by Romas Lileikis. The Lithuanian Choral Ensemble &quot;Dainava&quot; was utilized as the chorus.

<text>The Sendeanlage Bisamberg (Bisamberg transmission facility) was an Austrian medium wave transmission facility built in 1933 and demolished on February 24, 2010.

The original transmitter was destroyed at the end of World War II, but was later rebuilt. It had two guyed steel framework masts, one with a height of 265 metres and another with a height of 120 metres. Both masts were insulated against ground. The higher mast, which was the tallest construction of Austria before demolition, was designed for use on 585 kHz, while the smaller one was designed for 1476 kHz.

From January 1, 1995 to July 1, 1997, the installation was shut down, with the 1476 kHz transmitter being reactivated on July 1, 1997. The masts were demolished with controlled explosions on February 24, 2010; this decision by the city of Vienna was based on the fact that maintenance of the technologically obsolete masts as historical monuments would have been too costly.

As of February 24, 2010, the Danube Tower is the tallest structure in Austria.

<text>Stepping Stones Light is a Victorian-style lighthouse in Long Island Sound, in Nassau County, New York. The lighthouse is square-shaped and made of red brick, standing one-and-a-half stories high. The Hudson-Athens Lighthouse is a virtual twin of this structure. The light is currently in use under the management of the United States Coast Guard. It is not open to the public.

The reef upon which it sits was given its name by Siwanoy (Minnefords) Native American legends. According to the legend, the tribe used warriors, medicine, and magic to chase the devil out of present-day Westchester County, New York onto City Island (formerly Greater Minneford Island), surrounding him at Belden Point. The devil then picked up huge boulders lying there and tossed them into Long Island Sound, using them as stepping stones to make his escape. The natives named the rocks &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Stepping Stones&quot;.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Stepping Stones Light Station on September 15, 2005, reference number 05001026. The light station has been declared surplus, and the application for transfer under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000 is under review. In 2008, the light station was transferred to the Town of North Hempstead. In 2014, the Town of North Hempstead entered into a partnership with the Great Neck Historical Society and the Great Neck Park District to raise funds to rehabilitate the Lighthouse. The National Park Service and New York State Senator Jack Martins provided $165,000 and $100,000 in grant funding, respectively, to support the restoration efforts.

<text>Hoyerswerda () or Wojerecy (; Polish: &quot;Wojrowice&quot;) is a major district town in the district of Bautzen in the German state of Saxony. It is located in the Sorbian settlement area of Upper Lusatia, in which the Upper Sorbian language is spoken in addition to German.

Hoyerswerda is divided into the Old Town and the New Town, surrounded by village areas. The Old Town is the historical centre with many old houses and sight-seeing attractions, the New Town is more modern and varicoloured. Prior to the renovation of the town, prefabricated apartment blocks predominated in this area.

The town has many lakes, marshes and waterways in its surrounding area, because of its situation in Lusatia. This brings many tourists to spend their holidays there. It is attractive for cyclists and inline skaters who use recently created paths meandering among the lakes.

==Geography==
The town is situated in the north of the District of Bautzen, close to the borders of Saxony with Brandenburg. Major cities and towns in proximity are Cottbus in the north-west, Dresden in the south-west and Berlin in the north. Hoyerswerda is part of Upper Lusatia and lies on a rural plain characterised by the presence of several lakes and some marshes.

===Districts===
Hoyerswerda is divided beside the Old Town and New Town into the following districts (names given in German/Upper Sorbian):

* Bröthen-Michalken (German), Brětnja/Michałki (Upper Sorbian)
* Dörgenhausen/Němcy
* Knappenrode/Hórnikecy
* Schwarzkollm/Čorny Chołmc
* Zeißig/Ćisk

====Old Town====
The old town of Hoyerswerda is divided into eleven districts:

Neida, Dresdner Vorstadt, Am Bahnhof (&#x27;At the Railway Station&#x27;), Am Stadtrand (&#x27;On the Outskirts&#x27;), an der Neupetershainer Bahn, An der Thrune, Innere Altstadt (&#x27;Inner Historic Centre&#x27;), Senftenberger Vorstadt, Spremberger Vorstadt, Nördliche Elsteraue, Südliche Elsteraue.
====New Town====
The new town of Hoyerswerda is divided into 14 districts:

==History==

===Early history===
The first settlers arrived in this area in 700 AD. They were Milceni Slavs. Many artifacts from this old culture have been found in the Hoyerswerda area.

1000 AD saw the construction of the first church in the town; the (&#x27;Holy Family&#x27;) which is still standing today in the historic centre of Hoyerswerda.

In 1150, Hoyerswerda first appeared on a map of Lusatia.

The city was first mentioned in 1268. At the time the mayor was Hoyer von Vredeberg.

In 1371 it was designated an official market town. Before this Hoyerswerda was a very little town with few structures, but the city then grew under the leadership of the new mayor Karl IV.

It received municipal rights from Freiherr von Duba on 19 December 1423, as well as the right to elect its own council.

In the 17th century, the city experienced many problems due to the 30 Years War. The Number of inhabitants dropped drastically, but recovered by the end of the century.

In 1624, Hoyerswerda became the capital of the Spremberg district. A few years later the district took the name Hoyerswerda because of the growing importance of the city.

In the middle of this century Hoyerswerda had become the largest town in the Lusatian region.

In the 18th century the Polish King and Elector of Saxony, Augustus II the Strong, gave the Duchy of Hoyerswerda to Ursula Katharina Lubomirska, who helped the town develop trade and manufacturing. In 1737, King Augustus III of Poland bought the town from Lubomirska. The King used to stop in the Hoyerswerda Castle during his travels from Dresden to Warsaw. The Battle of Hoyerswerda occurred nearby in 1759 during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

In 1815 Hoyerswerda became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Initially it was administered as part of the of the Province of Brandenburg, but in 1825 the southern part was split off to form and attached to the Province of Silesia. In 1871, with Prussia, it became part of the German Empire. In 1873 a new railway between Hoyerswerda and Ruhland opened. It had a positive effect on the economic development of the city. In 1912, the Domowina, the organisation of the Sorbs, was founded in the city. In 1918, the Sorbs protested here against the policy of Germanisation. The town became part of the Prussian Province of Lower Silesia in 1919.

===Recent history===

During the Second World War, in 1944, the Dulag 124 prisoner-of-war camp was relocated from Slavuta to Hoyerswerda. At the end of the war the town was declared a core centre of German defence and was therefore heavily damaged. The invading Soviet Red Army set the town on fire. It became part of Saxony again after the war, but from 1952, it was administered by the Bezirk (Region) of Cottbus, until 1990, when the states of East Germany were abolished.

During the GDR period, Hoyerswerda became an important industrial town. The lignite processing enterprise &quot;Schwarze Pumpe&quot; was established in 1955 (it is today in the federal state of Brandenburg). From 1957, the demand for new living space rose dramatically. In the following years, 10 new living areas were established with tens of thousands of apartments being built. In 1981, the city reached its maximum number of inhabitants, with 71,054 residents. At that time, more children per inhabitant were born in Hoyerswerda than anywhere else in the GDR. Upon reunification in 1990, the people of the city decided to become part of the reconstituted state of Saxony. With the end of the GDR and the reorganisation of the East German economy, many enterprises in the industrial region of Hoyerswerda were scaled down or closed.

In 1991 multiple xenophobic attacks targeted immigrant workers from the Far East as well as asylum seekers from Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe. A hostel accommodating asylum seekers was attacked and petrol bombs were thrown. Media coverage of the unrest shocked many in Germany and abroad, provoking much public debate.
Between 1993 and 1998, several smaller villages became part of the city, but the number of overall inhabitants declined rapidly, from about 70,000 people in the 1980s to about 35,000 people by the end of 2012. There have been attempts to renovate the city. Many of the apartment blocks built during the time of the GDR have been demolished or renovated. This project, like others, was financed with money from the EU and the Federal Republic of Germany.

Its role as an independently ruled town (&quot;Kreisfreie Stadt&quot;) in Saxony disappeared in 2008 with the reshaping of the regional administration of Saxony.

==Sights==
Main sights include:
*the Hoyerswerda castle
*the Market Square (&quot;Markt&quot;) in the Old Town, including:

*CDU: 10 seats
*The Left: 8 seats
*Free voters: 5 seats
*SPD: 4 seats
*AH: 2 seats 
*NPD: 1 seat
*Total: 30 seats

==Economic situation==
While part of East Germany, employment in Hoyerswerda was provided by a power plant, glassworks, coal mines, and an army artillery range. With the reunification of Germany and the subsequent demise of a centrally planned economy, the city lost many jobs as the glassworks and artillery range were closed, and the power plant reduced its payroll. The industries on the secondary sector disappeared nearly completely. It is, however, expected that new houses must be built in Hoyerswerda, because of an anticipated increase in population due to copper mining at Schwarze Pumpe. There is also a thermal power plant planned for Hoyerswerda, because the district heating contract with Schwarze Pumpe will end in 2016.

Unemployment remains at 13%. Hoyerswerda holds third place regarding poverty of children according to a statistics of the Child Protection Alliance.
