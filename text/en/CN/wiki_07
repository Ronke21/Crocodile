<text>Tanya Donelly (born July 14, 1966) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist based in New England. She came to prominence as a co-founder of the band Throwing Muses with her step-sister Kristin Hersh. Donelly went on to co-form the alternative rock band The Breeders alongside Kim Deal in 1989, before leaving to front her own band Belly in 1991. By the late 1990s, she settled into a solo recording career, working largely with musicians connected to the Boston music scene.

Donelly is best known for her Grammy-nominated work in the mid-1990s as lead vocalist and songwriter for Belly, when she scored a national radio and music television hit with her composition &quot;Feed the Tree&quot;. Belly recorded on Sire/Reprise Records and 4AD Records; Donelly&#x27;s solo works have been released on Warner Bros. Records and 4AD.

Over the years, she has listed several musical influences. In one interview, she named her guitar playing influences as Marc Ribot, the Beatles, and former bandmate Hersh. More recently, she mentioned Leonard Cohen as a songwriting hero, citing her then-current listening favorites as Lucinda Williams and Joan Wasser, and listing Boston-based groups like the Dambuilders, Pixies, and Count Zero as past favorites. Although Donelly mainly performs her own original songs, she has in recent years added covers of songs by Robyn Hitchcock, Nina Simone, the Beatles, and Pixies to her repertoire.

==Early life==
Donelly has said that her parents, Richard and Kristin Donelly, shuttled the family &quot;between Rhode Island and California&quot; for the first four years of her life. Donelly has described her early school experience as including bouts of nervous shyness from fear that what she has called her family&#x27;s &quot;hippie&quot; background was different from that of her classmates.

Donelly has said that she met Kristin Hersh in school around age eight, quickly becoming close friends. Donelly&#x27;s father later married Hersh&#x27;s mother after both divorced in the 1980s. When she was 12 years old, Donelly and her mother were injured in a traumatic car accident that led her to carefully weigh for the first time her spiritual values and her concept of what &quot;God&quot; was. Previously, her upbringing had been an atheist one, but after the car accident a family friend introduced Donelly to the Hindu traditions of Krishna, in which she immersed herself for a brief period. She graduated from Rogers High School in Newport, Rhode Island.

==Throwing Muses band beginnings==

Around age 14, Hersh&#x27;s and Donelly&#x27;s fathers both gave them their own guitars and they initially started playing along with Beatles songs. Soon after, the two started to play along with songs written by Hersh&#x27;s musical father and then began to write original songs of their own. Donelly co-founded Throwing Muses with Hersh and other members like Elaine Adamedes at around age 15.

Throughout the 1980s, Donelly worked as lead guitarist and secondary vocalist/songwriter, complementing the work of Throwing Muses leader Hersh. The group moved from Rhode Island to Boston around 1986 and signed as the first American group on the influential British label 4AD. Although the band&#x27;s work generally employed complex rhythms and offbeat chord structures, Donelly has said she eventually accepted that her compositions were simpler and had &quot;more traditional songwriting sensibilities&quot; than Hersh&#x27;s, by the last two years she worked in the band. Some of her tunes from this period include &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Reel,&quot; &quot;Pools in Eyes&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, &quot;Giant&quot;, &quot;Dragonhead&quot;, &quot;Honeychain&quot;, &quot;Not Too Soon&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;. Hersh&#x27;s most popular Muses songs like &quot;Fish&quot;, &quot;Dizzy&quot;, &quot;Counting Backwards&quot; and most of &quot;The Real Ramona&quot; LP almost always featured Donelly&#x27;s distinctive lead guitar playing, heavy background vocals, inner vocal workings with different lyrics and pop vocal harmonies and melodic hooks.

==1990s: Breeders and Belly==
By 1990, Donelly had additionally begun working in a side project called The Breeders with Kim Deal of Pixies, a Boston-based group who had opened shows for Throwing Muses in the 1980s. The first album&#x27;s vocals and songwriting responsibilities were centered on Deal. The group released &quot;Pod&quot; with Donelly in 1990.

&quot;The Real Ramona&quot;, Throwing Muses&#x27; last album with Donelly, which included her &quot;Not Too Soon&quot; and &quot;Honeychain&quot; originals, was released in 1991. In May 1991, Deal and Donelly were asked to contribute vocals to This Mortal Coil&#x27;s &quot;Blood&quot; album on 4AD, with a cover of Chris Bell&#x27;s &quot;You and Your Sister,&quot; a month before Donelly officially left Throwing Muses.

In December 1991, Donelly formed Belly as guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, with Thomas Gorman on lead guitar, Chris Gorman on drums, and Fred Abong (previously with Throwing Muses) on bass guitar. This group would become her primary creative focus for the next few years, as Donelly&#x27;s participation in The Breeders faded after the 1992 release of the &quot;Safari&quot; EP.

In 1993 Belly released the &quot;Star&quot; LP, with Gail Greenwood soon replacing Fred Abong on bass after the release for touring. The album soon peaked at number two on the United Kingdom music charts and featured a single and music video, &quot;Feed the Tree&quot;, that quickly was rated number one on the Modern Rock Tracks Survey. The album scored commercial chart successes and was certified as a gold record in 1994 by the RIAA. The band was also nominated for two Grammy Awards (Best New Artist and Best Alternative Music Performance) and won two Boston Music Awards the same year.

In 1995, Belly released a second album, &quot;King&quot;, which progressed the avant folk-rock influences, power-pop jangle guitar sounds, and vocal harmonies of the first album into a direction driven more by vocals and driving rhythms, varying the pace within the songs to create tension. Flangers and chorus effects were evident in the guitar sounds. This album, produced by Glyn Johns, did not match the commercial success of &quot;Star&quot;. The band broke up in 1996.

==1990s solo career begins==
In 1995, during her post-Belly/pre-solo career, Donelly recorded a track with Catherine Wheel entitled &quot;Judy Staring at the Sun,&quot; which appeared on Catherine Wheel&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Happy Days&quot;. The single version featured Donelly and Catherine Wheel&#x27;s lead singer Rob Dickinson singing in trade-off vocals, but after the final Belly album, Catherine Wheel&#x27;s record label insisted that the song be re-recorded to remove most of Donelly&#x27;s vocals, replacing them with Dickinson&#x27;s, although Donelly&#x27;s voice can still be heard during the chorus of the reworked version.

The 1995 tribute album &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records, included the cover of &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; performed by Tanya Donelly and Juliana Hatfield.

In November 1996, Donelly put together a group of musicians to tour internationally with, just prior to her first solo release, the &quot;Sliding &amp; Diving&quot; EP on 4AD. Included on the tour were husband Fisher on bass, keyboardist Lisa Mednick (formerly of Juliana Hatfield&#x27;s group), drummer Stacy Jones (formerly of Letters to Cleo and Veruca Salt), and Madder Rose guitarists Mary Lorson and Billy Cot√©. The album release featured Donelly on vocals, guitars and keyboards, Rich Gilbert (of Human Sexual Response, Goober &amp; the Peas, Blackstone Valley Sinners) on pedal steel, Fisher on bass, and drummers David Lovering (formerly of the Pixies) and Jones.

After the 1997 dual solo release of &quot;Pretty Deep&quot; with two different B-sides, she toured North America with Fisher, Throwing Muses&#x27; drummer Dave Narcizo, Gilbert, and keyboardist Elizabeth Steen. She soon released her solo debut LP &quot;Lovesongs for Underdogs&quot;, recorded with Gilbert, Fisher, Jones, Narcizo, and engineer Wally Gagel on assorted instruments.

==Career since 2000==
In 2000, Donelly performed live in her first reunion with Throwing Muses at a special fan gathering called &quot;Gut Pageant&quot; in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and at a Rhode Island festival.

She continued to record and release symbol-laden, alternative folk-pop solo EPs and full-length LPs on 4AD in 2001, 2002, and 2004. Belly&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Ride: The Best of Belly&quot; retrospective was also released in 2002.

As Donelly&#x27;s writing continued to mature into a softer rhythmic vein than with the Belly material, allusions to motherhood were heard in songs like &quot;Life is But a Dream&quot; and &quot;The Night You Saved My Life&quot; on her 2002 &quot;Beautysleep&quot; release. Mark Sandman, of Boston&#x27;s Morphine indie-rock group, sang on &quot;Moonbeam Monkey.&quot; Donelly&#x27;s background vocals are heard on several tracks of the 2003 self-titled Throwing Muses reunion album, which she helped promote with public performances as backing vocalist and guitarist for a few concerts in 2003. Boston post-punk band Mission of Burma included Donelly&#x27;s backing vocals on their reunion album, &quot;Onoffon&quot; in 2004.

The same year, she released &quot;Whiskey Tango Ghosts&quot;, a sparely arranged, acoustic album laced with Gilbert&#x27;s pedal steel guitar touches. The album&#x27;s personnel included Steen on piano, Narcizo on drums, and Fisher on guitar, bass, and drums. The album&#x27;s lyrics explored, in part, marital relationships and family life. Donelly has said the album&#x27;s minor-key tone was influenced by &quot;a horrible war, a horrible administration, a bleak, mean winter.&quot;

She then followed that acoustic album release with three weekend shows of old and new songs performed in 2004 before audiences at The Windham, an old hotel in Bellows Falls, Vermont. Backing Donelly in concert were Fisher on guitar, Gilbert on pedal steel and acoustic guitar, Joan Wasser (of the Dambuilders, and Joan as Policewoman, Lou Reed, Antony and the Johnsons) on violin and backing vocals, Joe McMahon (of Se√±or Happy and Will Dailey) on upright bass, Bill Janovitz (lead singer of Buffalo Tom) contributing vocals, and Arthur Johnson (of Come) on drums. The performances were recorded by Donelly&#x27;s manager, veteran producer Gary Smith of Fort Apache Studios, which helps operate the small concert space and recording room in The Windham&#x27;s lobby. While Donelly included some of her longtime lyrical allusions to nature imagery, such as bees and honey, in the songs recorded at the Vermont concerts, she said that some of her new material reflected a more direct approach, relying less on symbolic analogy. The topics of religion and spiritual hypocrisy, which first began to interest her after her childhood automobile accident, were reflected in the lyrics to &quot;Kundalini Slide,&quot; performed at these concerts. The album of the Vermont performances is titled &quot;This Hungry Life&quot; and was released by Eleven Thirty Records on October 17, 2006 in the US and October 24, 2006 in Canada.
In June 2005, Donelly mentioned on her official &quot;Slumberland&quot; message board that her future plans included working on a children&#x27;s compilation album with Boston musicians such as Chris Toppin, writing a book, working with Mark Eitzel and Greek songwriter Manolis Famellos, and occasionally performing live. She planned to focus future performance plans on a few cities like Boston, New York, and London, playing live when time permitted as she raised her daughter. In March 2006, she gave birth to another daughter, Harriet Pearl Fisher.

In early 2006, Donelly sang on two songs on the debut EP from the Boston-based band Dylan In The Movies. In October 2006, she recorded a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; with producer Paul Kolderie for the American Laundromat Records benefit CD titled &quot;Cinnamon Girl - Women Artists Cover Neil Young for Charity&quot;.

She wrote four songs for the pop girl group Girl Authority for their second debut &quot;Road Trip&quot;, one of which is titled &quot;This Is My Day&quot;. Her daughter, Gracie, is a fan of the group, according to an article in &quot;The Phoenix&quot;.

Two shows at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on October 6, 2007, were a musical reunion of sorts, as Donelly co-headlined with Hersh.

In 2008, Donelly teamed up with Dylan in the Movies to cover The Cure&#x27;s &quot;Lovecats&quot; for American Laundromat Records tribute compilation &quot;Just Like Heaven - a tribute to The Cure&quot;. They later repeated this pairing to cover the Smiths&#x27; Shoplifters of the World Unite in 2011.

A 2010 feature in &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; profiles Donelly&#x27;s new career as a postpartum doula.

In December 2010, Donelly teamed up once again with singer and songwriter Brian Sullivan&#x27;s band, Dylan In The Movies, to release the single &quot;Girl With the Black Tights&quot; on American Laundromat Records. Donelly shares a co-writing credit and sings on the track, which was later included on his album release in 2014.

In August 2013, Donelly surprised her audience by announcing a series of extended plays to be issued online. Each release featured songs co-written with friends, musicians and previous collaborators including authors. The first volume contained five songs; &quot;Mass Ave&quot; (for which a video was also released), &quot;Christopher Street&quot;, &quot;Let Fall The Sky&quot;, &quot;Blame The Muse&quot; and &quot;Meteor Shower&quot;. In a rare and extensive interview on a podcast by UK music website The Mouth Magazine, Donelly announced that the series was her way of taking control of an exit strategy as she retired from the music industry. The recordings from the 5 EPs were released as a 31 track compilation, the Swan Song Series.

In early February 2016, the official Belly website announced the group would reform to play shows in Europe the following July and, subsequently, North America. The group released a new album, Dove, in 2018. They took a hiatus after 2018, but have toured again since 2023.

An album of covers with the Parkington Sisters was released in 2020, including of tracks by Leonard Cohen and her oft stated influence, Mary Margaret O‚ÄôHara.

Donelly was slated to compose the score for the 2022 animated film &quot;Luck&quot;, but was replaced by John Debney. 

In 2020, Donelly formed a new duo with long time collaborator Brian Sullivan, entitled The Loyal Seas. The debut single ‚ÄúStrange Mornings in the Garden‚Äù was released in December 2020. The duo&#x27;s full-length debut ‚ÄúStrange Mornings In the Garden‚Äù followed in 2022.

==Personal life==
Donelly married former Juliana Hatfield bassist Dean Fisher on September 22, 1996. They have two daughters.

<text>An alumni association or alumnae association is an association of graduates or, more broadly, of former students (alumni). In the United Kingdom and the United States, alumni of universities, colleges, schools (especially independent schools), fraternities, and sororities often form groups with alumni from the same organization. These associations often organize social events, publish newsletters or magazines, and raise funds for the organization. Many provide a variety of benefits and services that help alumni maintain connections to their educational institution and fellow graduates. In the US, most associations do not require their members to be alumni of the relevant university to enjoy membership and privileges.

Additionally, such groups often support new alumni, and provide a forum to form new friendships and business relationships with people of similar background.

Alumni associations are mainly organized around universities or departments of universities, but may also be organized among students that studied in a certain country. In the past, they were often considered to be the university&#x27;s or school&#x27;s old boy society (or old boy network). Today, alumni associations involve graduates of all age groups and demographics.

Alumni associations are often organized into chapters by city, region, or country.

The Society of Alumni of Williams College, founded in 1821, claims to be &quot;the oldest continuing college or university alumni organization in the world&quot;.

<text>Wageningen University &amp; Research (also known as WUR) is a public research university in Wageningen, Netherlands, specializing in life sciences with a focus on agriculture, technical and engineering subjects. It is a globally important center for life sciences and agricultural research. It is located in a region of the Netherlands known as the Food Valley.

WUR consists of Wageningen University and the former agricultural research institutes of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture. Wageningen University, as a research university, grants degrees at the BSc, MSc and PhD level in life and social sciences. It focuses its research on scientific, social and commercial problems in the field of life sciences and natural resources. It is widely known for its agriculture, forestry, and environmental studies programs. The university has about 12,000 students from over 100 countries. It is a member of the Euroleague for Life Sciences (ELLS) university network.

== History ==
In 1876 the &quot;Rijkslandbouwschool&quot; (National Agricultural College) was established in Wageningen. Due to the development of the training to a higher educational level it changed in 1896 to the &quot;Hoogere Land- en Boschbouwschool&quot; (Agricultural and Forestry College) and in 1904 in &quot;Rijks Hoogere Land-, Tuin- en Boschbouwschool&quot; (National Agricultural, Horticulture and Forestry College).

In 1918 the school became academic by law (Academic Education Act). The name changed to &quot;Rijks Landbouw Hoogeschool&quot; (National Agricultural College). The opening date and official start date is 9 March 1918.

In 1986 the research oriented &quot;hogescholen&quot; (comparable to scientific institute of technology or business schools) were renamed to University in a modification of the Academic Education Act. The new name became &quot;Landbouwuniversiteit Wageningen (LUW)&quot; (Wageningen Agricultural University (WAU)).

Over the years the research and teaching branched out into life sciences in general, while interest for agriculture as a career opportunity waned. In 1997, when the DLO institutes (Dienst Landbouwkundig Onderzoek / Service of agricultural research) merged with the university, the new organisation was rebranded as Wageningen UR (Wageningen University and Research Centre); with the university being renamed Wageningen University. Under Dutch laws the university and the institutes had to remain separate legal entities.

In 2006, the university of applied sciences Van Hall Larenstein became part of Wageningen UR. The idea was to create better collaboration between applied teaching and research at Van Hall and the academic research at Wageningen University. This would also support students to continue with an academic program upon completing their applied degree. However, due to differences in organizational culture and incompatibility of procedures, the collaboration remained problematic. In 2012 it was decided that Van Hall Larenstein would leave Wageningen UR and continue as an independent school once more. In the spring of 2015 the separation was marked by the move of the final Wageningen-based Van Hall Larenstein studies back to Velp.

In 2009 it was decided that the university would consistently use the English name in its communication, and that university research could be presented under the name of the university: &quot;Wageningen University (WU)&quot;, or under of the name Wageningen University and Research (WUR). On 6 September 2016 Wageningen University and the research institutes became one joint brand: &quot;Wageningen University &amp; Research&quot; (&quot;WUR&quot;).

On 9 March 2018 Wageningen University celebrated her 100 years anniversary. During this year there were many events and festivities around the campus and in the city of Wageningen.

==Academic profile==
Wageningen University was the first Dutch university or school that was allowed to use the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) label. This label is awarded by the European Commission and guarantees the quality of the study program. The university consequently applies this system, thus promoting the mobility of students within Europe and preventing study delay.

===BSc programs===

The university offers 19 BSc programs (2018‚Äì2019). For some BSc programs, the language of instruction is English. Other programs teach in both Dutch and English. The programs start each year in September, last three years, and consist of 180 ECTS credits. The programs are in the field of economy and society, health, life sciences and technology, nature and environment, animals and plants.

===MSc programs===
Wageningen University offers 36 different MSc programs (2017‚Äì2018) and two online masters programs. Although formally the same MSc program, from 2022 onwards the Master of Management Economic and Consumer studies program was offered as 5 independent MSc tracks (Sustainable Business Innovations, Sustainable Supply Chain Analytics, Consumer Studies, Economics of Sustainability, Governance of Sustainability Transformations). The language of instruction for all Master&#x27;s programs is English. The programs start each year in September, they last two years, and consist of 120 ECTS credits. Most programs offer various specializations and possibilities for majors, as well as full or partial premaster tracks for candidates not fulfilling all entry requirements.

===PhD program===
The regular PhD program is a four-year program during which PhD candidates are appointed as junior researcher in the universities, building up unemployment and retirement benefits. Such fully paid PhD candidates on a four-year contract can be asked to perform teaching tasks for a maximum of 10% of their time as part of their appointment. Candidates supported by specific grants (usually bestowed upon the candidate by an (international) organisation), or doing PhD next to a regular job can also enrol. In these cases a tailored timeline will be agreed upon. The program consists of a research component (conducting research under supervision and writing a thesis) and a smaller education component (30 ECTS or half a year of course load with conference presentations, and some management and teaching tasks can be listed as learning activity).

==Research institutes==

The following research institutes are part of Wageningen Research:
* Wageningen Environmental Research - Wageningen UR, formerly Alterra
* Wageningen Economic Research - Wageningen UR, formerly Landbouw Economisch Instituut Wageningen UR (LEI Wageningen UR)
* Wageningen Bioveterinary Research - Wageningen UR, formerly Central Veterinary Institute
* Wageningen Centre for Development Innovation - Wageningen UR, formerly Centre for Development Innovation

* Wageningen Food Safety Research - Wageningen UR, formerly RIKILT

== Controversy ==
Wageningen University and Research has come under fire due to claims of partiality in research. One case regards a research concerning bee colony collapse disorder. Research conducted by Tjeerd Blacqui√®re on the topic has caused controversy due to funding received for the research from the German pesticide producer Bayer, the world&#x27;s biggest producer of neonicotinoid insecticides, a suspect factor for the colony collapse disorder.

In 2018 the Dutch magazine OneWorld went to court in an attempt to demand access to contracts between WUR and Bayer, Syngenta and Monsanto, but OneWorld ultimately lost the court case.

<doc id="1229920" wikidata="Q372787" url="?curid=1229920" title="Deathlike Silence Productions">
<text>Deathlike Silence Productions (DSP) was a Norwegian independent record label founded in Oslo in 1987 (initially as Posercorpse Music) that focused on black metal. DSP supported the Norwegian black metal scene in the early 1990s. Helvete was the headquarters of DSP.

==History==
The label was founded in 1987 by √òystein Aarseth, also known as Euronymous, who operated the label until his murder in 1993. The name was derived from the Sodom song &quot;Deathlike Silence&quot; (from their 1986 release &quot;Obsessed by Cruelty&quot;).

At first, the label mainly signed Norwegian acts, but as early as 1990 Aarseth had desired to establish a Swedish branch with Morgan H√•kansson of Marduk, and towards its final years its also released an album by Japanese artist Sigh. Aarseth was considering signing Rotting Christ, Masacre (Colombia) and Hadez (Peru) before his death.

Before the label&#x27;s demise in 1994, it was planned to release Monumentum&#x27;s debut album &quot;In Absentia Christi&quot;. Darkthrone had threatened to release their second album &quot;A Blaze in the Northern Sky&quot; through Deathlike Silence when Peaceville Records would not due to their sudden change in genre. Voices of Wonder &quot;took over Deathlike Silence Productions after the death of Euronymous.&quot;

<text>Sir George Douglas Robb (1899‚Äì1974) was a New Zealand surgeon, medical reformer, writer, and university chancellor.

==Career==
He was born at Auckland on 29 April 1899 and educated at the Auckland Grammar School and at the University of Otago (MB ChB). Robb had a reputation as something of a maverick and a rebel against the conventional medical establishment, as is discussed in a chapter in Brian Easton&#x27;s book &quot;The Nationbuilders&quot;.

Robb was influential in the formation of the Auckland Medical School as part of the University of Auckland. From 1961 to 1962, he held the year-long position of President of the British Medical Association.

A series of annual lectures at the University of Auckland has been named after Doug Robb.

In the 1956 New Year Honours, Robb was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He was made a Knight Bachelor in the 1960 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

==Personal life==

Robb was a close friend of the New Zealand poet and writer A. R. D. Fairburn, whose &quot;To a Friend in the Wilderness&quot; was dedicated to Robb. On 6 November 1935, Robb married Helen Seabrook of Auckland. His autobiography, &quot;Medical Odyssey&quot; was published in 1967 by Collins Bros. &amp; Co. Ltd., Auckland. Appendix 1 (4 pp.) contains a bibliography of Robb&#x27;s surgical and medical articles and other writings. W. B. Sutch wrote of Robb: &quot;Robb, unhappy with the politicians, became a foremost thoracic surgeon, and a leader in medical education and research.&quot;--&quot;The Quest for Security in New Zealand, 1840‚Äì1966&quot;; Oxford, 1966; p.¬†248.

There is a bronze head (1956) and portrait (1961) of Sir Douglas Robb by John Francis Kavanagh in the University of Auckland Art Collection.

Douglas Robb died in his sleep on the morning of his 75th birthday. His widow, Lady Robb, died in the 1979 Mount Erebus disaster.

<doc id="1229930" wikidata="Q219738" url="?curid=1229930" title="At-Tawbah">
<text>At-Tawbah () is the ninth chapter () of the Quran. It contains 129 verses () and is one of the last Medinan surahs. This Surah is known by two names, At-Taubah and Al-Bara&#x27;at. It is called At-Taubah in light of the fact that it articulates taubah (atonement) and informs about the conditions of its acceptance. (verse , ). The name Bara&#x27;at (Release) is taken from the opening word of the Surah.

It is believed by Muslims to have been revealed at the time of the Expedition of Tabuk in Medina in the 9th year of the &quot;Hijrah&quot;. The Sanaa manuscript preserves some verses, on parchment radiocarbon dated to between 578/44 bh and 669/49 ah.

It is the only Surah of the Quran that does not begin with &quot;Bismillah&quot;, the usual opening formula, &quot;In the name of God, the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate&quot;. It deals with almost the same topics as those dealt with in Surat al-Anfal. In contrast to all other surahs, the Islamic prophet Muhammad did not order that this formula should be put at the beginning of this surah. at-Tawba&#x27;s verse 40 refers to Abu Bakr as (&#x27;Second of the Two&#x27;).

== Omission of Bismillah ==
Out of all 114 Surahs of the Quran this is the only one to which Bismillah is not prefixed. Among the explanations put forward for his not doing so, the most commonly accepted according to Unal is that, like the Islamic salutation, &quot;Peace be upon you&quot;, the expression, &quot;In the Name of God, the All-Merciful, the All-Compassionate&quot; conveys security and giving of quarter to those addressed. However, &quot;Surat at-Tawbah&quot; begins with an ultimatum to certain polytheists in Arabia. It deals, for the most part, with a re-evaluation of the relations with the polytheists who were frequently violating their agreements, the campaign to Tabuk, a disclosure of the intrigues of the hypocrites in Madinah(9:64-67, 101), the importance of &quot;jihad&quot; in God&#x27;s cause(9:24), and relationships with the People of the Book.

==Sanaa manuscript folio 22, Q9:122-129==
Verses 122-129 are preserved in Folio 22 of the Sanaa manuscript. The sequence of Sanaa 1 chapters do not follow any other known quranic order and folio 22 is shared with Chapter 19 (Mary). Saudi-based experts in Quranic history emphasize that while Muhammad was alive, Quranic texts did not follow any standard sequence of surahs.

== Three Discourses ==
From opening up to the 37th ayat, the initial talk, was uncovered in Zil-Qa&#x27;adah A.H. 9. As the significance of the subject of the talk required its affirmation on the event of Hajj Muhammad dispatched Ali to follow Abu Bakr, who had just left for Makkah to lead the Pilgrims to the Ka&#x27;abah. He trained Ali to convey the talk before the representatives of the various clans of Arabia in order to advise them regarding the new policy guidelines pertinent to the mushriks.

Starting from ayat 38 up to 72nd ayat the subsequent talk was revealed during Rajab A.H. 9 or a little before this, when Muhammad was occupied with getting ready for the Campaign of Tabuk. The Believers were encouraged to take a dynamic part in Jihad, and the shirkers were seriously reproached for keeping down their riches and for wavering to forfeit their lives in the path for Allah due to their hypocrisy, powerless belief(iman) or carelessness.

The final section of ayaat 73rd to last, was uncovered on his return from the Campaign of Tabuk. There are a few pieces revealed in different events during the same time frame and were incorporated by Muhammad into the Surah as per instructions from Allah. This talk cautions the hypocrites of their malevolent deeds and censures those Believers who had remained behind in the Campaign of Tabuk. At that point in the wake of berating them, Allah exculpates those genuine Believers who had not partaken in the Jihad in the Way of Allah for one explanation or the other. 

In the middle of the ayat 97 In other words, apart from hypocrisy, one of their defects is that they did not even keep in touch with the Muslims of Madinah through which they would have known the rules of Sharia.

That is, these people want the Muslims to fall into such a cycle of trouble that these people get freedom from the kind of commands that they find very difficult to follow.¬† Especially on the occasion of the Battle of Tabuk, these people had the hope that this time the Muslims were facing the great power of Rome, so maybe this time they would lose all their power after being defeated by the Romans.¬† Further, Allah Ta&#x27;ala said that in reality these people are lying in the cycle of self-hypocrisy, which will cause them to be disgraced both in this world and in the hereafter.

== Exegesis ==
=== Battle of Badr ===
Some parts of the chapter are believed to be speaking about the help of Allah by sending the invisible army of war, particularly mentioning the battle of Badr. According to Muhammad Sulaiman al-Ashqar from Islamic University of Madinah, who quoted several contemporary and classical scholars, the invisible army here were the Angels army consisted of Gabriel, Michael, Raphael and thousands of best angels from the third level of heaven, all came to the battle of Badr by impersonating the appearance of Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, companion of Muhammad. are deemed as his other personal virtue and venerable status according to Islamic belief. Meanwhile, Mahdi Rizqullah has compiled the commentary from classical Islamic scholars, that the verse narration about the angels attendance in the battle were also supported by hadiths from hadith collection from Muslim ibn Hajjaj, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and the also from Quranic historiography work by Ibn Kathir. Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani gave commentary of another supportive narration from al-Baihaqi and Ibn Ishaq, through various hadith narration chains about the testimony from several different sahabah. This included the narration of Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib who at that time fought on the side of Qurayshite polytheist, who testified that he has been taken captive on the aftermath of the battle by a horse rider whom he did not recognize at all from Muslims rank. According to the hadith authority from Ahmad ibn Hanbal, The captor of Abbas were confirmed by Muhammad as one of the angel who helped the Muslims during this battle.

===Verses 9:2 - 9:6===

The Quran, chapter 9 (At-Tawba), verses 2‚Äì6:
 is termed as the &quot;Sword Verse&quot;. The journalist Arun Shourie has criticized this and many other verses from the Quran contending that the Sunnah and the Hadith are equally evocative in their support of Jihad. Many mainstream Islamic scholars, however, assert that this verse relates to a very specific event in early Islamic history i.e. the covenant that was made and consecutively broken by the polytheist tribes of Mecca:74-91. Some think they very easily bypass the fact that Quran is often quoted by Islamic scholars to be the book perfect for all times and all places and all humans, and if it is so, its verses never need a historical context at all. On the other hand, even if the Quran are not supposed to have a historic contextual explanation the context provided (such as the unfaithfulness in pacts and treatises) are mentioned in the previous verses, thus a part of the Quran itself instead of an &quot;out-world&quot; context relations. According to Asma Afsaruddin, citing various early exegetes&#x27; opinions regarding the Arab polytheists, the consensus among the earliest commentators has been that this does not translate into indiscriminate killing.:88-89

Similarly, Western Islam-scholar Rudolph F. Peters also asserts that indiscriminate killing is not supported in this verse.

===Verse 9:29===

At-Tawbah also contains: 

Al-RƒÅzƒ´ (d. 606/1210), on this occasion quoted an early exegetical authority, Ab≈´ Rawq (d. 140/757), who explained that this verse was not a unilateral condemnation of all Jews and Christians, but those &quot;who do not heed the prescriptions contained in the Torah and the Gospel, respectively&quot;. Similarly Al-Qur·π≠ubƒ´ (d. 671/1273) &quot;did not read into QurƒÅn 9:29 a wholesale denunciation of the People of the Book as an undifferentiated collectivity&quot;.:278 Modern Muslim scholars like Muhammad Abduh shared similar views, agreeing that this verse was revealed on the occasion of the military campaign in Tabuk, and this verse specifically deals with the People of the Book&quot;, and also that &quot;the only kind of legitimate war on which there is unanimity among Muslim scholars is the defensive war when proclaimed by the ImƒÅm in the event of an attack upon Muslim territory&quot;. The Grand Imam of al-Azhar from 1935 to 1945, Mustafa Al-Maraghi, notes that 9:29 means: &quot;fight those mentioned when the conditions which necessitate fighting are present, namely, aggression against you or your country, oppression and persecution against you on account of your faith, or threatening your safety and security, as was committed against you by the Byzantines, which was what led to Tabuk.&quot;

===Verse 9:103===
In Kitab al-Kafi, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq has narrated that Imams are not needy to what people own but rather collect religious tax on accord that Allah said, &quot;Take from their wealth (religious tax) and charity by which you purify them and cause them to increase and invoke blessings upon them.&quot; Therefore, it is the people who need that the Imam accepts from them.

===Q9:29 in Hadith===
According to Zayd ibn Thabit, when the Qu&#x27;ran was first being compiled, he found the last verses of this Surah in the possession of Abu al-h al-Ansari and no one else. In another account, Ubay ibn Ka&#x27;b informed Zayd that Muhammad taught him the end of this &quot;s≈´rah&quot; and recited the same verses. Some, like Ibn Hazm, suggested that Abu Khuzayma was the only one to have the last verses in written form, as Zayd and others had memorized them. In a continuum of Surah Al-Anfal, this Surah additionally manages the issues of harmony and war and puts together the subject with respect to the Tabuk Expedition. The Significant Issues, Divine Laws and pieces of Guidance incorporated in this surah are as follows
# Policy guidelines for Muslims pertaining the mushriks.
# Instructions to participate in Jihad.
# Guidelines about hypocrisy, feeble faith, and carelessness.
# Battle of Tabuk.
# Foundation of a Dar-ul-Islam (an Islamic state).
# Stretching out the impact of Islam to abutting nations.
# Pulverizing the underhandedness of the hypocrites.
# Setting up the Muslims for a battle in the reason for Islam.

==Hadith==

* Abu Ishaq said that he heard al-Bara&#x27; b. &#x27;Azib (Allah be pleased with him) say: The last complete sura revealed (in the Holy Qur&#x27;an) is Sura At-Tawbah (i e. al-Bara&#x27;at, ix.), and the last verse revealed is that pertaining to Kalala.

* Narrated Sa&#x27;id ibn Jubayr: I asked Ibn `Abbas about Surat At-Tawbah, and he said, &quot;Surat Al-Tauba? It is exposure (of all the evils of the infidels and the hypocrites). And it continued revealing (that the oft-repeated expression): &#x27;...and of them ...and of them.&#x27; till they started thinking that none would be left unmentioned therein.&quot; I said, &quot;What about) SuratAl-Anfal?&quot; He replied, &quot;Surat Al-Anfal was revealed in connection with the Battle of Badr.&quot; I said, &quot;(What about) Surat Al-Hashr?&quot; He replied, &quot;It was revealed in connection with Banu Nadir.&quot;

* Narrated Zayd ibn Thabit Al-Ansari: who was one of those who used to write the Divine Revelation: Abu Bakr sent for me after the (heavy) casualties among the warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great number of Qurra&#x27; were killed). `Umar was present with Abu Bakr who said, `Umar has come to me and said, The people have suffered heavy casualties on the day of (the battle of) Yamama, and I am afraid that there will be more casualties among the Qurra&#x27; (those who know the Qur&#x27;an by heart) at other battle-fields, whereby a large part of the Qur&#x27;an may be lost, unless you collect it. And I am of the opinion that you should collect the Qur&#x27;an.&quot; Abu Bakr added, &quot;I said to `Umar, &#x27;How can I do something which Allah&#x27;s Apostle has not done?&#x27; `Umar said (to me), &#x27;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing.&#x27; So `Umar kept on pressing, trying to persuade me to accept his proposal, till Allah opened my bosom for it and I had the same opinion as `Umar.&quot; (Zaid bin Thabit added:) `Umar was sitting with him (Abu Bakr) and was not speaking. me). &quot;You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of telling lies or of forgetfulness): and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&#x27;s Messenger. Therefore, look for the Qur&#x27;an and collect it (in one manuscript). &quot; By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains (from its place) it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Qur&#x27;an. I said to both of them, &quot;How dare you do a thing which the Prophet has not done?&quot; Abu Bakr said, &quot;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing. So I kept on arguing with him about it till Allah opened my bosom for that which He had opened the bosoms of Abu Bakr and `Umar. So I started locating Qur&#x27;anic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leaf-stalks of date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart). I found with Khuza`ima two Verses of Surat At-Tawbah which I had not found with anybody else, (and they were):-- &quot;Verily there has come to you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty He (Muhammad) is ardently anxious over you (to be rightly guided)&quot; (9.128) The manuscript on which the Qur&#x27;an was collected, remained with Abu Bakr until Allah took him unto Him, and then with `Umar till Allah took him unto Him, and finally it remained with Hafsa, `Umar&#x27;s daughter.

==Placement and coherence with other surahs==
The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as &quot;nazm&quot; and &quot;munasabah&quot; in non-English literature and &quot;coherence&quot;, &quot;text relations&quot;, &quot;intertextuality&quot;, and &quot;unity&quot; in English literature. Hamiduddin Farahi, an Islamic scholar of the Indian subcontinent, is known for his work on the concept of nazm, or coherence, in the Quran. Fakhruddin al-Razi (died 1209 CE), Zarkashi (died 1392) and several other classical as well as contemporary Quranic scholars have contributed to the studies. The entire Qur&#x27;an thus emerges as a well-connected and systematic book. Each division has a distinct theme. Topics within a division are more or less in the order of revelation. Within each division, each member of the pair complements the other in various ways. The seven divisions are as follows:

<text>Karsten Schubert (12 August 1961 ‚Äì 30 July 2019) was a German art dealer and publisher working in London.

==Career==
Before opening his own gallery, Schubert worked at the Lisson Gallery.

===Karsten Schubert London===
Schubert ran Karsten Schubert London, initially in collaboration, and with the backing of, Richard Salmon, from 1986 to 1991. His first exhibition was of the sculptor Alison Wilding, that he continued to show until his death.

His 1988 group show of Ian Davenport, Gary Hume and Michael Landy was one of the first &quot;commercial&quot; gallery shows of artists that would later come to be known as Young British Artists (YBA). The gallery quickly came to represent many of the YBA artists and several non-British artists. In addition to the exhibition programme the gallery also contributed to the publication of a series of catalogues and books which offered an overview of the YBA scene.

The gallery relocated from Charlotte Street to smaller premises in Foley Street, continuing its exhibition and publishing programme. Rachel Whiteread&#x27;s 1996 departure from the gallery (to Anthony d&#x27;Offay) triggered a reorientation of Schubert&#x27;s activities. He became a private artists&#x27; representative and art dealer working with a select number of artists of whose art he particularly liked, most famously Bridget Riley.

In 2007, the company moved to premises on Golden Square in Soho then, in January 2014 moved to Lexington Street, Soho. That same year, Schubert co-organised an exhibition of Bridget Riley‚Äôs work at David Zwirner Gallery in London.

===Other===
Schubert was a trustee of Space, London. He was also a faculty member of the Fine Arts programme, for 20152016, at the British School at Rome.

==Personal life==
In 2015, Schubert was diagnosed with medullary thyroid cancer. In July 2019, he died aged 57 from the disease.

<text>Al-Anfal (, ; The Spoils of War, Earnings, Savings, Profits) is the eighth chapter (s≈´rah) of the Quran, with 75 verses (ƒÅyƒÅt). Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l&quot;), it is a &quot;Medinan surah&quot;, completed after the Battle of Badr. It forms a pair with the next surah, At-Tawba.

According to the eminent Muslim philosopher Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, the chapter was probably revealed in 2 A. H. after the Battle of Badr, the first defensive clash between Meccans and Muslim people of Medina after they fled from persecution in Mecca. As it contains an extensive point-by-point survey of the Battle, it gives the idea that most presumably it was uncovered at very much the same time. Yet, it is additionally conceivable that a portion of the verse concerning the issues emerging because of this Battle may have been uncovered later and joined at the best possible spots to make it a consistent entirety.

==Summary==
*1 Spoils belong to God and his Apostle
*2-4 True believers and their future reward 
*5-6 Muslims reproved for distrusting their Prophet
*7 God gives the Muslims either the Quraish or their caravan

*9 Angelic aid vouchsafed to Muhammad
*10-11 The Muslims refreshed and comforted before the battle
*12 The angels enjoined to comfort the faithful by destroying the infidel Quraish
*13-14 Infidels are doomed to punishment here and hereafter
*15-16 Muslims are never to turn their backs on the infidels on pain of hell-fire
*17-18 The victory of Badr a miracle
*19 The Quraish are warned against further warfare with the Muslims
*20-21 Muslims exhorted to steadfastness in faith
*22-23 Infidels compared to deaf and dumb brutes
*24 Believers are to submit themselves to God and his Apostle
*25-28 They are warned against civil strife, deception, and treachery
*29 God&#x27;s favour to true believers
*30 Plots against Muhammad frustrated by God
*31 The infidels liken the Quran to fables
*32-33 The Quraish were protected from deserved punishment by Muhammad&#x27;s presence among them
*34-38 The idolaters of Mecca rebuked and threatened
*39 An amnesty offered to the Quraish
*40 Impenitent idolaters to be extirpated from the earth
*41 How the spoils of war are to be divided
*42-43 The Muslims were led by God to fight at Badr to attest the truth of Islam
*44 The Muslims encouraged, and the infidels lured to destruction, by each seeing the other to be few in number
*45-46 Believers exhorted to obedience
*47 Believers warned against impious vainglory
*48 The devil deserts the Quraish at Badr
*49-51 The fate of hypocrites
*52-54 Their doom like that of Pharaoh and his people
*55 The worst of beasts are the infidels
*56-58 Treachery to be met with its like
*59 God is against the infidels
*60 The Muslims excited to war against unbelievers
*61 Condition of peace with unbelievers
*62-64 The miracle of Arab union
*65-66 God with the Prophet and the Muslims in warring for the faith
*67-69 Muslims reproved for accepting ransom for the captives taken at Badr
*70-71 Captive Quraish exhorted to accept Islam, and warned against deception
*72-73 The brotherhood of Muslims (and its obligatory related to it), fact that disbelievers are helpers of one another, and effect for Muslims if they don&#x27;t help another. 
*74 The brotherhood of the Ans√°rs and Muh√°j Jir√≠n
*75 The hereditary rights of blood-relations re-established

== Name ==
The Surah is named Al-Anfal (The Bounties) from the first ayat. The word utilized in the ayat is ÿßŸÑŸíÿ£ŸéŸÜŸÅŸéÿßŸÑŸê. The word &quot;ÿ£ŸéŸÜŸÅŸéÿßŸÑ&quot; alludes to what is given as an extra sum past what is required. A very subtle perspective is covered in employing this word: the reward of undertaking jihad for God is permanently saved with God. Other than this prize, the spoils of war that are picked up from the Unbelievers are an extra offer for such individuals; before the Day of Judgment, the Almighty awards these to the participants of the war.

== Text narratives ==
This subject of this Surah can be considered to be the issue of Jihad. 
=== Verse 8:12 ===

Tafsir Ibn Kathir says this means, &quot;you -- angels -- support the believers, strengthen their (battle) front against their enemies, thus, implementing My command to you. I will cast fear, disgrace and humiliation over those who defied My command and denied My Messenger&quot;.

===Verse 8:17===
Muhammad al-Baqir narrates in hadith that:

which refers to the relatives of the Messenger of Allah. &quot;Al-Khums (one fifth) belongs to Allah, the Messenger and to us (his Ahl al-Bayt)&quot;. One source states that Ubay ibn Khalaf was ransomed after Badr, but was killed by Muslims with a spear in the Battle of Uhud (625 CE). Verse was revealed in this occasion.

===Verses 8:42 and 8:47===
The Battle of Badr is also the subject of this Surah, which details military conduct and operations. Though the Surah does not name Badr, it describes the battle several times:

These verses highlighted both the chance encounter of the battle (both sides had blundered into each other) as well as the underestimation of both the size of the Meccan army by the Muslims and the fierceness of the Muslim army by the Meccans. The Meccan army was described in the second verses, and &quot;Satan&quot; may be referring to Amr ibn HishƒÅm, who was hated by the Muslims and allegedly pushed for the battle repeatedly.

===Verses 8:75===
According to Al-Suyuti, the aftermath of the battle of Uhud had several implication for the Companions of the Prophet as some of them though they can inherit the wealth of the fallen, due to the previous bonding between Muhajirun and Ansar in the event of Brotherhood among the Sahabah. This case were highlighted in a Hadith of such event when Ka&#x27;b ibn Malik, a Medinan Ansari warrior who has fallen during the battle and previously bonded brotherhood with Zubayr ibn al-Awwam. Then Muhammad revealed Sura Al-Anfal, Ayah , which annulled the inheritance rights between fabricated &quot;brotherhood&quot;, and forbidding Zubayr to inherit Ka&#x27;b wealths, as the one who truly has the right to inherit his wealth were his true blood relatives such as his children&#x27;s.

<text>The Port of Singapore is the collection of facilities and terminals that conduct maritime trade and handle Singapore&#x27;s harbours and shipping. It has been ranked as the top maritime capital of the world, since 2015. Currently the world&#x27;s second-busiest port in terms of total shipping tonnage, it also transships a fifth of the world&#x27;s shipping containers, half of the world&#x27;s annual supply of crude oil, and is the world&#x27;s busiest transshipment port. It was also the busiest port in terms of total cargo tonnage handled until 2010, when it was surpassed by the Port of Shanghai.

Because of its strategic location, Singapore has been a significant entrep√¥t and trading post for at least two centuries. During the contemporary era, its ports have not become just a mere economic boon for the country, but an economic necessity because Singapore is lacking in land and natural resources. The port is critical for importing natural resources, and then later re-exporting products after they have been domestically refined and shaped in some manner, for example wafer fabrication or oil refining to generate value added revenue. The Port of Singapore is also the world&#x27;s largest bunkering port. The majority of ships that pass between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean go through the Singapore Strait. The Straits of Johor on the country&#x27;s north are impassable for ships due to the Johor-Singapore Causeway, built in 1923, which links the town of Woodlands, Singapore to the city of Johor Bahru in Malaysia.

==History==

===Before 1819===

In the late 13th century, a Kingdom known as Singapura was established on the north bank of the Singapore River around what was called the Old Harbour. It was the only port in the southern part of the Strait of Malacca and serviced ships and traders in the region, competing with other ports along the coast of the Malacca Strait such as Jambi, Kota Cina, Lambri, Semudra, Palembang, South Kedah and Tamiang. The port had two functions. First, it made available products that were in demand by international markets; according to the &quot;Daoyi Zhil√ºe&quot; (&quot;Brief Annals of Foreign Islands&quot;, 1349) by Chinese trader Wang Dayuan (born 1311, &quot;fl.&quot; 1328‚Äì1339), these included top-quality hornbill casques, lakawood and cotton. Although these goods were also available from other Southeast Asian ports, those from Singapore were unique in terms of their quality. Secondly, Singapore acted as a gateway into the regional and international economic system for its immediate region. South Johor and the Riau Archipelago supplied products to Singapore for export elsewhere, while Singapore was the main source of foreign products to the region. Archaeological artefacts such as ceramics and glassware found in the Riau Archipelago evidence this. In addition, cotton was transshipped from Java or India through Singapore.

In 1984, an archaeological excavation had commenced at Fort Canning Hill led by the archaeologist Dr John Miksic. A range of artefacts including earthenware, ceramic, and porcelain pieces were found which suggests Singapore&#x27;s role as an active trading port in the 14th century.

By the 15th century, Singapore had declined as an international trading port due to the ascendance of the Malacca Sultanate. Local trade continued on the island. A map of Singapore by Portuguese mathematician Manuel Godinho de Eredia showed the location of &quot;Xabandaria&quot; or the office of a &quot;shahbandar&quot;, the Malay official responsible for international trade. Shards of 15th-century Siam ceramics and late 16th ‚Äì or early 17th-century Chinese blue and white porcelain have been found at the Singapore and Kallang Rivers. Singapore also provided other regional ports with local products demanded by international markets. For instance, blackwood (a generic term used by Europeans to refer to rosewood) was exported from Singapore to Malacca, and was in turn purchased by Chinese traders and shipped to China for furniture-making:)

In the early 17th century, Singapore&#x27;s main settlement and its port were destroyed by a punitive force from Aceh. After this incident, there was no significant settlement or port at Singapore until 1819.

===1819‚Äì1960===

In 1819, Stamford Raffles, a British colonial official, excited by the deep and sheltered waters in Keppel Harbour, established for the British Empire a new settlement and international trading port on the island. Keen to attract Asian and European traders to the new port, Raffles directed that land along the banks of the Singapore River, particularly the south bank, be reclaimed where necessary and allocated to Chinese and English country traders to encourage them to establish a stake in the port-settlement. Chinese traders, because of their frequent commercial interactions with Southeast Asian traders throughout the year, set up their trading houses along the lower reaches of the river, while English country traders, who depended on the annual arrival of trade from India, set up warehouses along the upper reaches. The port relied on three main networks of trade that existed in Southeast Asia at that time: the Chinese network, which linked Southeast Asia with the southern Chinese ports of Fujian and Guangdong; the Southeast Asian network, which linked the islands of the Indonesian archipelago; and the European and Indian Ocean network, which linked Singapore to the markets of Europe and the Indian Ocean littoral. These networks were complementary, and positioned Singapore as the transshipment point of regional and international trade. By the 1830s, Singapore had overtaken Batavia (now Jakarta) as the centre of the Chinese junk trade, and also become the centre of English country trade, in Southeast Asia. This was because Southeast Asian traders preferred the free port of Singapore to other major regional ports which had cumbersome restrictions. Singapore had also supplanted Tanjung Pinang as the export gateway for the gambier and pepper industry of the Riau‚ÄìLingga Archipelago by the 1830s, and South Johor by the 1840s. It had also become the centre of the Teochew trade in marine produce and rice.

As the volume of its maritime trade increased in the 19th century, Singapore became a key port of call for sailing and steam vessels in their passage along Asian sea routes. From the 1840s, Singapore became an important coaling station for steam shipping networks that were beginning to form. Towards the late 19th century, Singapore became a staple port servicing the geographical hinterland of the Malay Peninsula. Following the institution of the British Forward Movement, Singapore became the administrative capital of British Malaya. Roads and railways were developed to transport primary materials such as crude oil, rubber and tin from the Malay Peninsula to Singapore to be processed into staple products, and then shipped to Britain and other international markets. During the colonial period, this was the most important role of the port of Singapore.

===1963‚Äì2021===
Singapore ceased to be part of the British Empire when it merged with Malaysia in 1963. Singapore lost its hinterland and was no longer the administrative or economic capital of the Malay Peninsula. The processing of raw materials extracted from the Peninsula in Singapore was significantly reduced due to the lack of a common market between Singapore and the Peninsular states.

Since Singapore&#x27;s full independence in 1965, it had to get an edge to compete with other ports in the region to attract shipping and trade at its port. It has done so by developing an export-oriented economy based on value-added manufacturing. It obtains raw or partially manufactured products from regional and global markets and exports value-added products back to these markets through market access agreements such as World Trade Organization directives and free trade agreements.

By the 1980s, maritime trading activity had ceased in the vicinity of the Singapore River except in the form of passenger transport, as other terminals and harbours took over this role. Keppel Harbour is now home to three container terminals. Other terminals were built in Jurong and Pasir Panjang as well as in Sembawang in the north. Today, the port operations in Singapore are handled by two players: PSA International (formerly the Port of Singapore Authority) and Jurong Port, which collectively operate six container terminals and three general-purpose terminals around Singapore.

In the 1990s the port became more well-known and overtook Yokohama, and eventually became the busiest port in terms of shipping tonnage.

Singapore is part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the southern tip of India, to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, to the Upper Adriatic region of the northern Italian hub Trieste with its rail connections to Central Europe and the North Sea.

=== Since 2022 ===

The Tuas Mega Port is projected to be the only port in Singapore after the PSA city terminals and Pasir Panjang Terminal are closed in 2027 and 2040 respectively, ending an era of port operations in the city area which began in 1819. The Sea Transport Industry Transformation Map (ITM) launched by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) aims to grow the industry&#x27;s value-add by $4.5 billion and create more than 5,000 new jobs by 2025.

Automation will be a key part of the new port, with over 1,000 battery-powered driverless vehicles and a fleet of almost 1,000 automated yard cranes to be developed for the port. Nelson Quek, PSA Singapore&#x27;s head of Tuas planning stated that &quot;Tuas, when it&#x27;s fully developed, is going to be the single largest fully-automated terminal in the world&quot;. It will also be able to cater to the demands of the world&#x27;s largest container ships, with 26¬†km of deep-water berths. Besides just handling containers, the port will have space set aside for companies to be located, a move that aims to improve the links between port and businesses. It is projected to be twice the size of Ang Mo Kio new town.

Operations at Tuas Mega Port began in September 2021, and the port officially opened on September 1, 2022 with three berths in service.


==Operations==


The port is the world&#x27;s busiest port in terms of shipping tonnage handled, with 1.15 billion gross tons (GT) handled in 2005. In terms of cargo tonnage, Singapore is behind Shanghai with 423 million freight tons handled. The port retains its position as the world&#x27;s busiest hub for transshipment traffic in 2005, and is also the world&#x27;s biggest bunkering hub, with 25 million tonnes sold in the same year.

Singapore is ranked first globally in 2005 in terms of containerised traffic, with 23.2 million Twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) handled. High growth in containerised traffic has seen the port overtaking Hong Kong since the first quarter of 2005, and has led the race ever since, with an estimated 19,335 kTEUs handled in the year up to October, compared to 18,640 kTEUs handled in Hong Kong in the same period. A rise in regional traffic consolidating the port&#x27;s position in Southeast Asia, and increases in transshipment traffic using the strategic East Asia-Europe route via Singapore helped the port to emerge tops at the end of the year, a title it had not held since overtaking Hong Kong once in 1998.

This Medinan surah aims at protecting the newly formed Muslim community by outlining acceptable behavior for Muslims. It illustrates the Quran&#x27;s role as an authoritative legal source and its ability to shape the community. The surah aims to eradicate the earlier practices of pagan, Arab communities that are no longer considered moral in the Muslim society. For example, the section of this surah about dealing fairly with orphan girls () addresses the pre-Islamic Arabic practice of marrying orphan girls to take their property.

Shirk (refer and ) is held to be the worst form of disbelief, and it is identified in the Quran as the only sin that God will not pardon.

Thematically, &quot;an-NisƒÅ&quot; not only addresses concerns about women, but also discusses inheritance, marriage laws, how to deal with children and orphans, legal practices, jihƒÅd, relations between Muslim communities and People of the Book, war, and the role of Jesus as a prophet, rather than the son of God as Christians claimed. Furthermore, in discussing war, this surah encourages the Muslim community to fight for the vulnerable in war, as demonstrated by 4:75: &quot;Why should you not fight in God&#x27;s cause and for those oppressed men, women, and children who cry out, ‚ÄòLord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors! By Your grace, give us a protector and give us a helper!‚Äô?&quot; The surah addresses a multitude of issues faced by the early Muslim community and responds to the challenges the community faced. The wide variety of issues addressed in the surah and the length of the surah make it difficult to divide into literary structures. However, based on a study of themes present in each section of the Surah, Amƒ´n Ahsan IslƒÅhƒ´ divides the surah into three thematically-based sections: social reform, the Islamic community and its opponents, and a conclusion. Mathias Zahniser presents an alternative means of looking at the structure of this surah. He claims that the central theme of this surah is the address to the Christians. He has come to this conclusion based on examination of the structure of the surah based on such devices as parallels, repetition, and ring composition. However, Carl Ernst admits that more works needs to be done in this type of structural analysis to more fully understand the composition of such extensive suras.

In &quot;Qur&#x27;an and Woman,&quot; Amina Wadud places interpretations of the Quran into three categories: traditional, reactive, and holistic. The type of interpretation one applies to surah 4 greatly influences one&#x27;s perspective on the role of women within Muslim society. Taking the third approach, a holistic approach allows for a feminist reading of the Quran, which is particularly relevant to an-NisƒÅ and can reshape the understanding of this surah.

== Classification ==
Regarding the timing and contextual background of the believed revelation (&quot;AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l&quot;), it is a Medinan surah as confirmed by Muhammad Husayn Tabataba&#x27;i, who states that the sura must have been revealed after the hijrah based on the subject matter.

Although an-NisƒÅ typically appears as the fourth surah, according to the N√∂ldeke classification of surahs, based on Islamic traditions, &quot;The Women&quot; was approximately revealed as the hundredth surah. Amir-Ali places it as the 94th surah, while Hz. Osman and Ibn`Abbas believe it is the 92nd. Imam Ja&#x27;far as-Sadiq places it as the 91st surah revealed. Based on the legislation concerning orphans, the surah was most likely revealed after many Muslims were killed at the Battle of Uhud, leaving numerous dependants in the new Muslim community. The revelation, therefore, began around the year three, according to the Islamic calendar, but was not completed until the year eight. Consequently, parts of this surah, the second-longest in the Quran, were revealed concurrently with portions of &quot;The Examined Woman,&quot; sura 60. However, the surah shows some thematic coherence, despite its disjointed and ongoing revelation.

Furthermore, as relates to the placement of this surah within the Quran as a whole, Neal Robinson notes what he refers to as the &quot;dovetailing&quot; of surahs. Based on this idea of structure, one surah ends with a topic that is immediately picked up in the next surah. The Family of &#x27;Imran, surah 3, includes a discussion of male and female near the end of the surah (). This theme continues at the beginning of surah 4: &quot;People, be mindful of your Lord, who created you from a single soul, and from it created its mate, and from the pair of them spread countless men and women far and wide; be mindful of God, in whose name you make requests of one another.&quot; This dovetailing may indicate a complex editorial process involved in ordering the surahs.

==Exegesis==
===3 Institutions of Marriage and Slavery===

A detailed explanation of this verse is given in the &#x27;interpretation&#x27; (Tafsir) of Ibn Kathir, a scholar of the Mamluk era:

Al-Jalalayn, says: 
===15‚Äì16 Unlawful sexual intercourse===

In verses , the first, preliminary directives for the punishment for unlawful sexual intercourse are stated. The first verse deals with women. The punishment laid down was to confine them until further directives were revealed. The second verse (i.e. 16) relates to both sexes. The injunction lays down that they should be punished ‚Äì that is, they should be kept refined to houses..
===22‚Äì23 Incest===

Verses 4:22-23 cover which classes of women within one&#x27;s family with whom marriage or sexual intercourse would be considered haram.

These relationships and limitations are defined and elaborated on within Tafsir al-Jalalayn.

=== 34 Men are the protectors and maintainers of women ===

There are a number of interpretations of the original Arabic 4:34. 
&quot;The Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World&quot; terms Verse 4:34 the Quran&#x27;s least egalitarian verse.

Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence.

===48 Idolatry and polytheism ===

Tafsir, Ibn Kathir says, Allah said that He, &quot;forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship)&quot;, meaning, He does not forgive a servant if he meets Him while he is associating partners with Him&quot;. The &quot;Enlightening Commentary into the Light of the Holy Qur&#x27;an&quot; says, &quot;Polytheism is the worst form of sins and it is a barrier against the Divine forgiveness.&quot;

===59 Obedience Verse===

=== 65 Verse ===
Muhammad al-Bukhari, Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, Ibn Majah and Nasa&#x27;i narrated a hadith transmitted by Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, that believed by some scholars as the Asbab al-Nuzul (cause of revelation) of the Sura of An Nisa verse 65. However, there are contemporary Fatwa that the revelation of this verse were attributed to az-Zubayr were weak, as the stronger Hadith which attributed to the revelation of this verse were instead attributed to the tradition of Umar, the second Rashidun Caliph

===69 Martyrs, and the righteous===
Muhammad ibn Sulayman recorded that al-Sadiq relayed to his elderly father, Abu Muhammad ibn Sulayman, concerning the following verse: &quot;And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger ‚Äì those will be with the ones upon whom Allah has bestowed favor of the prophets, the steadfast affirmers of truth, the martyrs and the righteous. And excellent are those as companions.&quot; (4:69) stating, &quot;The Messenger of Allah in this verse is from &quot;of the prophets&quot;, and we (Ahl al-Bayt) in this subject are &quot;the truthful and the martyrs&quot; and you all, (our followers), are the &quot;righteous&quot;, so adopt this name.&quot;

===74‚Äì76 Fight for the cause of Allah===
According to Ibn Kathir: &quot;Therefore, the believers fight in obedience to Allah and to gain His pleasure, while the disbelievers fight in obedience to Shaytan. Allah then encourages the believers to fight His enemies&quot;. Islam allows war in self-defense (Quran ), to defend Islam (rather than to spread it), to protect those who have been removed from their homes by force because they are Muslims (Q), and to protect the innocent who are being oppressed (Q).

===89‚Äì90 Do not take hypocrites as allies or helpers===
The verse discusses a group of people who nominally became Muslims and secretly supported the enemies of Muslims. For those hypocrites to prove their loyalty, they were commanded to emigrate and join the ranks of the believers, or they would be considered enemies. Muhammad advises his companions to avoid taking these individuals as helpers or guardians. 

===116 Shirk===

Tafsir Ibn Kathir says: &quot;Shirk shall not be forgiven, in reality the idolators worship shaytan&quot;.

===127‚Äì130 Female orphans, desertion by husband, and desirability of marital peace===
These verses cover issues associated with female orphans; desertion by the husband and the desirability of marital peace.

===145 Hypocrites===
In Kitab al-Kafi, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq writes a letter to his companions stressing the importance of obeying Allah, his Messenger, and the &quot;Wali al Amr&quot; (Progeny of Muhammad)- going so far as to say that those who disobey and deny their virtues are &quot;liars and hypocrites&quot;. He asserts that these are the individuals described as &quot;hypocrites&quot; in the verse, &quot;Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire ‚Äì and never will you find for them a helper.&quot;

===157 Islamic view on Jesus&#x27; death===


An explanation of the Islamic view of Jesus as a prophet, rather than as the son of God as Christians claim, is given in Tafsir Ibn Kathir.

===171 Islamic view of the Trinity===

<doc id="1229948" wikidata="Q1376690" url="?curid=1229948" title="Jason London">
<text>Jason Paul London (born November 7, 1972) is an American actor, known for his roles as Randall &quot;Pink&quot; Floyd in director Richard Linklater&#x27;s film &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993), Jesse in &quot;The Rage: Carrie 2&quot; (1999), and Rick Rambis in &quot;Out Cold&quot; (2001).

==Early life==
London was born in San Diego, California, the son of Debbie (n√©e Osborn), a waitress, and Frank London, a sheet metal worker. He was raised mainly in DeSoto, Texas. After having divorced Jason&#x27;s father, his mother moved the family 13 times in six years. His identical twin brother, Jeremy, is younger by 27 minutes and is also an actor, working mostly in television. The two have acted alongside each other only once ‚Äì in the February 3, 2003, episode of the WB&#x27;s &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, entitled &quot;Smoking.&quot; 

The twin boys had a younger sister, Dedra, who was also an actor. Dedra London died in a car accident in 1992 at the age of 16.

==Career==
London began his career in his junior year of high school. His brother, Jeremy, wanted to audition for the movie &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; (1991)&quot;.&quot; London gave his brother a ride to the audition and tried for the part as well. He resulted in getting the part and his brother was his stunt double.

London later received what would become his most popular role as Randall ‚ÄúPink‚Äù Floyd in the movie &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993)&quot;.&quot;

London has enjoyed success starring mostly as a rebellious, edgy young addict in feature films such as &quot;Broken Vessels&quot; (1998) and &quot;$pent&quot; (2000). He starred as Jason in the NBC miniseries &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (2000). He also starred in &quot;Poor White Trash&quot; (2000) playing sleazy ladies&#x27; man Brian Ross.

London portrayed Mark, the local newspaper editor, in the Hallmark Channel television movie, &quot;The Wishing Well&quot; (2010), which also starred Jordan Ladd and Ernest Borgnine.

In addition to his film and TV work, London also appeared in Aerosmith&#x27;s 1993 video &quot;Amazing&quot; with Alicia Silverstone.

==Personal life==

In November 2010, London became engaged to actress Sofia Karstens. They married on July 16, 2011 at the home of his wife&#x27;s parents in North Hero, Vermont.

London was arrested in 2013 for punching a bouncer, and again in 2021 for public intoxication.

<doc id="1229950" wikidata="Q219701" url="?curid=1229950" title="Al-Ma'idah">
<text>Al-Ma&#x27;idah (; &#x27;The Table [Spread with Food]&#x27;) is the fifth chapter of the Quran, containing 120 verses. 

Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation, it is a Medinan chapter, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Medina rather than Mecca.

The chapter&#x27;s topics include animals which are forbidden, and Jesus&#x27;s and Moses&#x27;s missions. Verse 90 prohibits &quot;the intoxicant&quot; (alcohol). Verse 8 contains the passage: &quot;Do not let the hatred of a people lead you to injustice&quot;. Al-Tabligh Verse 67 is relevant to the Farewell Pilgrimage and Ghadir Khumm.

Verses have been quoted to denounce killing, by using an abbreviated form such as, &quot;If anyone kills a person, it would be as if he killed the whole people: and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people&quot;. The same formulation appears in the Mishnah in Sanhedrin. However, a columnist for &quot;Mosaic&quot; presents evidence suggesting that this coincidence is part of the Quran&#x27;s critique of Judaism, and early Muslims were aware of this context.

==Placement and coherence with other surahs==

The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as &quot;nazm&quot; and &quot;munasabah&quot; in non-English literature and &quot;coherence&quot;, &quot;text relations&quot;, &quot;intertextuality&quot;, and &quot;unity&quot; in English literature. Hamiduddin Farahi, an Islamic scholar of the Indian subcontinent, is known for his work on the concept of nazm, or coherence, in the Quran. Fakhruddin al-Razi (died 1209 CE), Zarkashi (died 1392) and several other classical as well as contemporary Quranic scholars have contributed to the studies. The entire Qur&#x27;an thus emerges as a well-connected and systematic book. Each division has a distinct theme. Topics within a division are more or less in the order of revelation. Within each division, each member of the pair complements the other in various ways. The seven divisions are as follows:

==Exegesis==
===3 Verse of Ikmal al-Din===
This verse was revealed at Arafat according to the hadith:
===27‚Äì31 Cain and Abel===

The story appears in the Quran 5:27‚Äì31:

===33 Hirabah verse ===
This verse from Qur&#x27;anic chapter &quot;al-ma&#x27;idah&quot; () is known as the &quot;Hirabah&quot; verse (&quot;ayat al-hiraba&quot;), It specifies punishment for &quot;those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to spread disorder in the land&quot;: The verbal noun form (i.e. &quot;·∏•irabah&quot;) is frequently used in classical and modern books of Islamic jurisprudence, but neither the word ·∏•irabah nor the root verb ·∏•araba occurs in the Quran. (&quot;Yu·∏•ƒÅrib≈´na&quot; is the form used in Quran .)

According to early Islamic sources, the verse was revealed after some members of the Urayna tribe feigned conversion to Islam in order to steal Muslims&#x27; possessions and killed a young shepherd sent to teach them about the faith. In view of the broad and strong language of the verse, however, various state representatives beginning with the Umayyads have asserted that it applied to rebels in general.

The original meanings of the triliteral root &quot;·∏•rb&quot; are to despoil someones wealth or property, and also fighting or committing sinful act. The Quran &quot;refers to both meanings&quot; in and .

===51 Do not take Jews and Christians as allies===
Some Muslim hard liners have used verses such as this one to denounce close relationships with non-Muslims and forbidding non-Muslims from becoming leaders in Muslim countries. However, other Muslim scholars such as Shafi Usmani see this as forbidding only &quot;indiscriminating intimacy&quot; which might confuse the &quot;distinctive hallmarks of Islam&quot;, while all other equitable relations as being allowed. Ghamidi in the context of his &quot;Itmam al-Hujjah&quot; interpretation of Islam, restricts the subjects of this verse to only the Jews and Christians of the Muslim Prophet&#x27;s time. Others argue that only belligerent non-Muslims are being referenced here. 
Verse 51 is preserved in the ·π¢an‚ÄòƒÅ‚Äô1 lower text.

===Verse 54===
Some hadith view the &#x27;beloved&#x27; in verse 54 as Abu Musa al-Ash&#x27;ari. Verse 54 is preserved in the ·π¢an‚ÄòƒÅ‚Äô1 lower text.

====Shia&#x27; view====
On the Shia interpretation of this verse, God used the singular form &quot;waliyyukum&quot; implying the &quot;wilayah&quot; (Guardianship of the believers) is a single project. In other words, the &quot;wilayah&quot; of the messenger and that of the Ali springs from the of God&#x27;s wilayah. The word &quot;wali&quot; in the context of this verse cannot mean &quot;friend&quot; because there is not a single verse in the Quran where God says that any one of his messengers is a friend or helper of their followers. Further if the verse implied &quot;wilayah&quot; in the sense of friend or helper, then the singular form &quot;waliyyukum&quot; would not have been used but the plural form &quot;awliya&#x27;ukum&quot; would be appropriate because the &quot;friendship&quot; of God is unique.

===Verses 72 and 73===
&quot;The Quran: An Encyclopedia&quot; says, &quot;The Quran‚Äôs objection to Christian practice is Christianity‚Äôs shirk, its worship of Jesus, Mary and the saints ‚Äòin derogation of Allah‚Äô. There is no justification in believing in the Trinity, for Jesus never would have condoned such a concept&quot;. 
=== Verse 82 ===
in Verse 82 it says, &quot;Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers the Jews and those who commit Shirk, and you will find the nearest in love to the believers those who say: &quot;We are Christians.&quot;

=== Verse 90 ===
In Verse 90 it says, &quot;O believers! Intoxicants, gambling, idols, and drawing lots for decisions are all evil of Satan‚Äôs handiwork. So shun them so you may be successful.&quot; This is a clear ruling in the Quran for Muslims to avoid alcohol and gambling.

<doc id="1229951" wikidata="Q1075317" url="?curid=1229951" title="Chlorosis">
<text>In botany, chlorosis is a condition in which leaves produce insufficient chlorophyll. As chlorophyll is responsible for the green color of leaves, chlorotic leaves are pale, yellow, or yellow-white. The affected plant has little or no ability to manufacture carbohydrates through photosynthesis and may die unless the cause of its chlorophyll insufficiency is treated and this may lead to a plant disease called rusts, although some chlorotic plants, such as the albino &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; mutant &quot;ppi2&quot;, are viable if supplied with exogenous sucrose.

The word &quot;chlorosis&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;khloros&quot; meaning &quot;greenish-yellow&quot;, &quot;pale green&quot;, &quot;pale&quot;, &quot;pallid&quot;, or &quot;fresh&quot;.

In viticulture, the most common symptom of poor nutrition in grapevines is the yellowing of grape leaves caused by chlorosis and the subsequent loss of chlorophyll. This is often seen in vineyard soils that are high in limestone such as the Italian wine region of Barolo in the Piedmont, the Spanish wine region of Rioja and the French wine regions of Champagne and Burgundy. In these soils the grapevine often struggles to pull sufficient levels of iron which is a needed component in the production of chlorophyll.

==Causes==
Chlorosis is typically caused when leaves do not have enough nutrients to synthesise all the chlorophyll they need. It can be brought about by a combination of factors including:
* a specific mineral deficiency in the soil, such as iron, magnesium or zinc
* deficient nitrogen and/or proteins
* a soil pH at which minerals become unavailable for absorption by the roots
* poor drainage (waterlogged roots)
* damaged and/or compacted roots
* pesticides and particularly herbicides may cause chlorosis, both to target weeds and occasionally to the crop being treated.
* exposure to sulphur dioxide
* ozone injury to sensitive plants 
* presence of any number of bacterial pathogens, for instance &quot;Pseudomonas syringae pv. tagetis&quot; that causes complete chlorosis on Asteraceae
* fungal infection, e.g. Bakanae.
However, the exact conditions vary from plant type to plant type. For example, Azaleas grow best in acidic soil and rice is unharmed by waterlogged soil.

==In grape vines==
Like many other plants, grape vines are susceptible to chlorosis, and symptoms of iron deficiency tend to be common on soils rich in limestone. In the wake of The Great French Wine Blight, when European &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; were affected by &quot;Phylloxera&quot;, chlorosis became a greater problem in viticulture. To deal with the Phylloxera blight, &quot;V. vinifera&quot; was grafted onto rootstock based on American species of the genus &quot;Vitis&quot;, such as &quot;Vitis riparia&quot;, &quot;Vitis rupestris&quot;, and &quot;Vitis berlandieri&quot;. However, many of these were less adapted to the lime-rich soils that were common in France&#x27;s vineyards, in particular many of those that produced wines of top quality. Many grafted vines in lime-rich vineyards therefore showed signs of iron deficiency, and in France this specific form of chlorosis was termed &quot;chlorose calcaire.&quot; The problem was largely overcome by the selection of lime-resistant American vines as basis for hybrid vines used for rootstock material. However, since such rootstocks may be less than optimal in other respects, it is necessary for the viticulturalist to balance the need for chlorosis resistance against other viticultural needs. This is illustrated by one of the most common lime-resistant rootstocks, 41 B, which is a hybrid between &quot;V. vinifera&quot; cultivar Chasselas and &quot;V. berlandieri&quot;, which generally has a sufficient, but not extremely high, Phylloxera resistance.

==Treatments==
Specific nutrient deficiencies (often aggravated by high soil pH) may be corrected by supplemental feedings of iron, in the form of a chelate or sulphate, magnesium or nitrogen compounds in various combinations. If the soil is too acidic, applying lime can raise the pH to the proper range, making more nutrients available to the plant. Likewise, sulfur can be used to lower soil pH if it is too alkaline.

<text>Al-An&#x27;am (, ; The Cattle) is the sixth chapter (s≈´rah) of the Quran, with 165 verses (ƒÅyƒÅt). Coming in order in the Quran after Al-Fatiha, Al-Baqarah, Al &#x27;Imran, An-Nisa&#x27;, and Al-Ma&#x27;idah, this surah dwells on such themes as the clear signs of Allah&#x27;s Dominion and Power, rejecting polytheism and unbelief, the establishment of Tawhid (pure monotheism), the Revelation, Messengership, and Resurrection. It is a &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, and it is believed to have been revealed in its entirety during the middle stage of the Meccan period of Islam. This explains the timing and contextual background of the believed revelation (&quot;AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l&quot;). The surah also reports the story of Ibrahim, who calls others to stop worshiping celestial bodies and turn towards Allah.

Groups of modern Islamic scholars from Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University in Yemen and Mauritania have issued &quot;fatwa&quot; taking the interpretation of Ibn Kathir regarding the 61st verse of Al-An&#x27;am and a Hadith transmitted by Abu Hurairah and Ibn Abbas, that the Angel of death has assistants among angels who help him to take souls.

==Placement and coherence with other surahs==
The idea of textual relation between the verses of a chapter has been discussed under various titles such as &quot;nazm&quot; and &quot;munasabah&quot; in non-English literature and &quot;coherence&quot;, &quot;text relations&quot;, &quot;intertextuality&quot;, and &quot;unity&quot; in English literature. Hamiduddin Farahi, an Islamic scholar of the Indian subcontinent, is known for his work on the concept of nazm, or coherence, in the Quran. Fakhruddin al-Razi (died 1209 CE), Zarkashi (died 1392) and several other classical as well as contemporary Quranic scholars have contributed to the studies. The entire Qur&#x27;an thus emerges as a well-connected and systematic book. Each division has a distinct theme. Topics within a division are more or less in the order of revelation. Within each division, each member of the pair complements the other in various ways. The seven divisions are as follows:

<text>Al-Araf (, ; The Heights) is the 7th chapter (&quot;s≈´rah&quot;) of the Qur&#x27;an, with 206 verses (ƒÅyƒÅt). Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;AsbƒÅb al-nuz≈´l&quot;), it is a &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it was revealed before the Hijra.

This chapter takes its name from verses 46‚Äì47, in which the word &quot;A&#x27;araf&quot; appears.

According to Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, the time of its disclosure is about the same as that of Al-An&#x27;am, i. e., the last year of the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s residence at Makkah: the manner of its admonition clearly indicates that it belongs to the same period and both have the same historical background; however, it cannot be declared with assurance which of these two was uncovered before the other. The audience should keep in mind the introduction to Al-An&#x27;am.

==Subject matter==
Although heading of the subject matter of this surah can be summarized as &quot;Invitation to the Divine Message&quot;, some further elaboration is required to comprehend the underlying themes and their interconnection.

==Contents==
The chapter refers to Adam and Eve, Noah, Lot, Hud, Saleh, Shuaib, Moses and Aaron. The significant issues, Divine laws and points of guidance in this surah are as follows 

# A greeting is given to the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) to become Muslims. 
# An admonition is given to the unbelievers about the results of their disavowal through referring to the case of punishments which were caused upon previous nations for their off-base mentality towards their Rasools. 
# The Jews are cautioned about the results of their deceptive lead towards the prophets. 
# Precept to proliferate the message of Islam with astuteness. 
# The fact that the Rasools just as the individuals to whom they are sent will be addressed on the Day of Judgment. 
# Precept to the Believers that they should wear respectable and appropriate dress and eat pure and good food. 
# Conversation between the inhabitants of Paradise, the prisoners of hell and the individuals of A&#x27;raf (a spot between the Paradise and hellfire). 
# Luxuriousness and difficulty are the reminders from Allah. 
# Muhammad is the Rasool for the entirety of humankind. 
# The fact that the coming of Muhammad was depicted in Torah and the Gospel (Bible). 
# Jews have created fabricated a wrong belief about Allah&#x27;s creation. 
# Humankind&#x27;s declaration about Allah at the hour of Adam&#x27;s creation. 
# Allah made all of humankind from a single soul. 
# Allah&#x27;s command to show forgiveness, speak for justice and stay away from the ignorant. 
# Allah&#x27;s order about tuning in to the recitation of The Qur&#x27;an with complete quietness.

==Theme ==
The chief subject of this Surah is an invitation to the Divine Message sent down to Muhammad. The Messenger had been admonishing the individuals of Makkah for 13 years. Yet there was no substantial impact on them, since they had deliberately ignored his message. And had become so adversarial that Allah was going to order Muhammad to disregard them and go to others. That is the reason they are being reproved to acknowledge the message and an admonition is given about the results of their off-base demeanor. Since Muhammad was going to get Allah&#x27;s edict to relocate from Makkah, the finishing up part of this Surah addresses the People of the Book with whom he was going to come into contact at Al-Madinah. In the ayaat directed to the Jews, the outcomes of their deceptive mentality towards the prophets are likewise brought up clearly. As they proclaimed to put belief in Musa (Moses) yet their practices were against his lessons. They were defying him as well as were in certainty worshipping falsehood.

Towards the ending of the Surah, guidelines are given to Muhammad and his adherents to show tolerance and exercise patience in answer to the incitements of their rivals. Since the devotees were feeling the squeeze and stress, are encouraged to be cautious and not make any stride that may hurt their cause.

==Exegesis==
===80-84 Lot in Islam===

Verses 7:80‚Äì84 deal with the story Lot who was sent to a city, that, according to the quranic narrative, was of the transgressors. Angels descend to protect Lot and his daughters, and the city is destroyed by a stone rain. Lot&#x27;s wife perishes as well. Lot was sent to a group of people who had committed unprecedented levels of immorality. The men amongst them approached other men with desire instead of women; and thus they were transgressing the bounds of God. Upon hearing the accusation that Prophet Lot had leveled on them, his people gave no answer but this: they said, &quot;Drive them out of your city: these are indeed men who want to be clean and pure!&quot; (the second part of the statement was probably a form of sarcasm). In the end, Allah saved Prophet Lot and his family except his wife who was amongst the evildoers and Allah punished the people by sending a rain of stones down on them.

===103-156 Moses===
The narrative focuses on the history of Moses

===142 Golden Calf===
The incident of the Golden Calf as narrated in Q7:142 paints a positive light on Aaron. The Quran says that Aaron was entrusted the leadership of Israel while Moses was up on Mount Sinai (, &quot;tur sina‚Äô&quot;) for a period of forty days . Q19:50 adds that Aaron tried his best to stop the worship of the Golden Calf. Further parts of the story are to be found in Quran 7:150. The story ends in an earlier chapter, Quran 5:25.

===157 The coming of Muhammad ===
Verse 7:157 reveals that prophecies about the coming of Muhammad were present in the Jewish law and Gospel.

===€© 206 Prostration=== 
This final verse, verse 206, requires a sajdah, or prostration.

:€ù Moreover &quot;the angels&quot; who are with my LORD do not proudly disdain his service, but they celebrate his praise and worship him.

<text>CSR plc (formerly Cambridge Silicon Radio) was a multinational fabless semiconductor company headquartered in Cambridge, United Kingdom. Its main products were connectivity, audio, imaging and location chips. CSR was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index until it was acquired by Qualcomm in August 2015. Under Qualcomm&#x27;s ownership, the company was renamed Qualcomm Technologies International, Ltd.

==History==
The company was founded in 1998 and split away from Cambridge Consultants as &quot;Cambridge Silicon Radio&quot; or CSR in 1999. The founding directors, who were all at Cambridge Consultants at the time were Phil O&#x27;Donovan, James Collier and Glenn Collinson. It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2004.

In 2005 the company acquired Clarity Technologies, a leading clear voice capture (CVC) business and UbiNetics, a 3G wireless (WCDMA/UMTS/HSDPA) technology company. In 2007, CSR acquired Nordnav, a Swedish-based GPS software company, and CPS, a Cambridge-based GPS software company producing Enhanced GPS in partnership with Motorola.

In February 2009, CSR announced it was merging with SiRF, the biggest global supplier of GPS chips, in a share deal worth $136 million; in July 2010, CSR announced the acquisition of Belfast-based APT Licensing Ltd. (APT) and its aptX audio technology and in February 2011, CSR announced it was merging with Zoran, a video and imaging technology company.

In May 2012, CSR acquired Direct Digital Feedback Amplifier (DDFA) technology, a proprietary, highly scalable digital Class-D audio amplifier technology; in June 2012, CSR announced that it had acquired the MAPX (formerly MAP-X) audio product line from Trident Microsystems, Inc and in July 2012, Samsung Electronics agreed to acquire CSR&#x27;s mobile phone connectivity (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) and location (GPS/GNSS) businesses and associated IP for US$310 million (¬£198 million). As part of the deal Samsung acquired a stake of 4.9% in CSR.

In June 2014, CSR acquired the people and technology of Reciva, a networked audio streaming platform, for US$5 million and in October 2014, the acquisition of CSR by Qualcomm for $2.5 billion was agreed. The transaction was completed in August 2015.

==Products==

CSR&#x27;s products included platform solutions for Bluetooth, GPS, FM broadcasting, Wi-Fi, audio, imaging, and ARM processors. After the Zoran merger, CSR also made digital imaging products based on the MIPS architecture.

<text>Charles N&#x27;Tchor√©r√© (16 November 1896 ‚Äì 7 June 1940) was a Gabonese French military officer who was shot by Germans in World War II.

== Early life ==
Charles N&#x27;Tchor√©r√© was born on 16 November 1896 in Libreville, French Gabon. The second of four children in a Mpongwe family, his father worked as an agent for a German commercial firm in German Kamerun. His parents arranged for him to be educated at the Catholic √âcole Montfort. He performed well as a student and while he was there befriended several persons who would later become politicians, including L√©on M&#x27;ba, Louis Bigmann, and Laurent Antchouey. He completed his studies in 1912. Upon the death of his mother, N&#x27;Tchor√©r√© went to Douala to work with his father and older brother. While there he refined his English, which was used as a &quot;lingua franc&quot; in the colony. In April 1914 he, at the urging of his father, returned to Libreville.

== Military career ==
World War I broke out in 1914, leading to clashed between French and German forces at the Gabon‚ÄìKamerun border. On 19 January 1916 N&#x27;Tchor√©r√©, despite being slightly underage, enlisted in the Tirailleurs S√©n√©galais. He underwent training at the Bakara military camp from then until 28 May, when he was made a secretary for a French officer in Libreville. He was promoted to the rank of sergeant the following year.

Unlike other Gabonese, N&#x27;Tchor√©r√© remained in the military after the end of the war. Following brief service in the Rif War in Morocco, he began training at the military school in Fr√©jus, southern France. In 1924 he was awarded the rank of major, equivalent to a senior NCO in the French army. He subsequently served under General Maurice Gamelin in defeating an uprising in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon and occupying Damascus.

Following the outbreak of World War II, N&#x27;Tchor√©r√©, who had become an officer and had the rank of captain, spent several months in late 1939 training West African troops for combat in Europe. The following year he took command of the 53rd Regiment d&#x27;Infantrie Coloniale Mixte S√©n√©galais. His unit fought Germans on the Somme River. After three days of resistance, the company was left with only ten Africans and five Europeans, and they surrendered near Amiens. The German commander refused to treat N&#x27;Tchor√©r√© as an officer. When he refused to fall in line with the black enlisted soldiers, N&#x27;Tchor√©r√© was shot. According to Richardot, the perpetrators were from 25th Infantry Regiment (according to Richardot, the 25th Infantry Regiment was from the 7th Panzer Division under command of Erwin Rommel but Scheck reports that Rommel&#x27;s division had advanced much farther from the area. N&#x27;Tchor√©r√©&#x27;s eldest son, Jean-Baptiste, was killed in action on the lower Somme later that month.

France posthumously honored N&#x27;Tchor√©r√© by naturalising him as a citizen in 1940. A memorial dedicated to N&#x27;Tchor√©r√© was established in Airaines, while a statue of him was erected outside the French embassy in Libreville. In 1962 Gabon featured him on a commemorative postage stamp.

<text>Tamarin () is a village on the western coast of Mauritius. It has long been the seat of the council district of Rivi√®re Noire (Black River). The district council recently moved to its new headquarters in Bambous, this village being more accessible to the villagers.

An old fisherman village, Tamarin has developed into a residential area and a moderated holiday resort. Tamarin is especially popular with surfers.

The village is surrounded by hills and is very picturesque. It is located next to Black River, another fisherman&#x27;s village on the west coast of the island.

Tamarin has benefited from continuous development in recent years including a new commercial and leisure area as well as a new primary school.

== Tamarin Bay ==
The area was known as Santosha Bay (you&#x27;ll still find the word &#x27;Santosha&#x27; scribbled on a few buildings in faded paint) and offered wave hunters some of the best surfing on the planet. In fact, before the bay earned the name Santosha, locals refused to give the beach a moniker because they didn&#x27;t want outsiders to discover their cache of surfable seas!

Tamarin Bay was discovered by a wider audience and immortalised after the release of the classic surf documentary &quot;Forgotten Island of Santosha&quot; by Larry and Roger Yates in 1974. Tamarin has two world renowned surfing spots: ‚ÄòDal‚Äô on its left (south) and ‚ÄòBlack Stone‚Äô on the right (north) of the bay.

Dolphins are often found close to Tamarin Bay. Both Spinners and Bottlenose dolphins are usually seen playing early in the morning in the bay before going back to the open sea. Various boat companies offer trips to watch and swim with dolphins in the mornings. Tamarin is very famous for their apartments and long service that they offer to tourists.

== Salt Pans ==

Tamarin is the main salt pan in Mauritius. Its hot and dry environment provides ideal conditions for salt making. The pans cover an area of about 30 hectares and can be seen from the main coastal road.

Salt production dates back to the French period and the tradition of its making is almost unchanged after nearly two centuries. Water is pumped directly from the nearby sea and allowed to evaporate in the basins. Salt is harvested a few days later.

By 2012 cheap imports (mostly from India) had been allowed and the production became uneconomic except for niche high value fleur de sel. By 2017 the main salt pans have stopped functioning and are being developed for housing and amenities.

== Transport ==

Tamarin is connected to Quatre Bornes and Port Louis by a Highway which together with all the other Main Roads are under the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Infrastructure.

Tamarin is near the terminus of the west line of Mauritius&#x27; former railway system.

== Education ==

√âcole maternelle et primaire Paul et Virginie, a French international school, is in Tamarin.

The Telfair International Primary, a private co-educational school, is also located in Tamarin.

<text>The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 4-LAV to the electric multiple units built to work the semi-fast services on the route between London and Brighton. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class.

==Construction==
The original series of 4-LAV (4-car Lavatory stock) units, (numbers 1921‚Äì1953), were built at Eastleigh carriage works during 1931 and 1932 for use on the newly electrified London to Brighton line. They were fitted with four Metropolitan-Vickers 275 h.p. traction motors. Despite the prominence given to the lavatory provision in the SR designation, there was actually only one vehicle containing lavatories in the whole four-car unit, and due to the lack of corridors in the unit, only passengers in that coach had access to them. The units were renumbered 2921‚Äì2953 in the January/February 1937 renumbering of SR EMUs. 

Two further units, (numbers 2954 and 2955) were added to stock in 1940, under the direction of Oliver Bulleid. These were fitted with English Electric 275 h.p. traction motors. 

The DMBT (Driving Motor Brake Third) had a full-width cab with a guard&#x27;s compartment behind, and seven third class compartments seating 70. The TC (Trailer Composite) had five first-class and four third-class compartments seating 40 in each class. The TCL (Trailer Composite with Lavatory) had five first-class and three third-class compartments seating 30 and 24, respectively, with a toilet at each end.

One unit, number 2926, was fitted with one 2-HAL type motor coach.

==Use==
Throughout their careers they operated the slower services on the London to Brighton line between either London Bridge or Victoria and Brighton railway station. They were also used on stopping trains on the Arun Valley Line and on the Sussex coast lines to the east and west of Brighton.

==Formations==
Initial formations of these units were as follows (cars not always formed in numerical order):
==Withdrawal==
The majority of the 4-LAV units were withdrawn from ordinary passenger service in 1968, with the final few going in April 1969, being replaced on their duties by new 4-VEP sets. Almost all the units were scrapped, but some of the 1940-built cars survived in departmental (non-revenue earning) use for several more years. However, no 4-LAV stock exists today.

<doc id="1229986" wikidata="Q1447998" url="?curid=1229986" title="William Sawrey Gilpin">
<text>William Sawrey Gilpin (4 October 1762 ‚Äì 4 April 1843) was an English artist and drawing master, and in later life a landscape designer.

==Biography==
Gilpin was born at Scaleby Castle, Cumbria on 4 October 1762, the son of the animal painter Sawrey Gilpin. He attended the school of his uncle, William Gilpin (originator of the Picturesque), at Cheam in Surrey. He married Elizabeth Paddock; they had two (or possibly three) sons, one of whom seems to have remained dependent on his father. He died at Sedbury Hall, North Yorkshire, the house of his cousin the Reverend John Gilpin, and is buried nearby in the churchyard at Gilling West.

==Artist==
In the 1780s, Gilpin taught himself the relatively new aquatint process of printmaking, to produce plates to illustrate his uncle&#x27;s books on picturesque scenery. Gilpin specialised in watercolours; and in 1804 was elected first President of the Society of Painters in Water-Colours. He was patronised by Sir George Beaumont, through whom he met the picturesque theorist Uvedale Price.

==Drawing master==
In 1806, Gilpin took a post as drawing master at the Royal Military College, Great Marlow (which moved to Sandhurst in 1812), teaching cadets to make accurate records of the landscape and the lie of enemy positions. This apparently secure employment came to a sudden end in 1820, when he was made redundant in a round of post-Napoleonic war cutbacks, at the age of nearly sixty.

==Landscape gardener==
To support his family, Gilpin turned to a career as a landscape gardener, for which he had little qualification or experience beyond an artist&#x27;s eye. He was helped and encouraged in this by Uvedale Price, whose theories on picturesque landscaping clearly accorded well with his own ideas. Gilpin&#x27;s work also shows the influence of the later work of Price&#x27;s old adversary Humphry Repton, who had died in 1818.

Gilpin seems to have been remarkably successful. In his short landscape design career he reputedly worked at &quot;some hundreds&quot; of sites. Relatively few designs survive on paper or unaltered on the ground. Features employed by Gilpin included amoeba-shaped flower beds, gently curving paths through irregular shrubberies, and raised terrace walks.

Sites where he is known to have worked include:

*Bowhill House, Scottish Borders
*Scotney Castle in Kent
*Nuneham House in Oxfordshire, where he laid out the Pinetum which now forms the core of the Harcourt Arboretum attached to the Oxford Botanic Garden.
*Shaw Hill in Lancashire
*Audley End House in Essex 
*Marston Bigot Park, Marston Bigot, Somerset.
*Wolterton Hall in Norfolk.
*Blayney Castle in Castleblayney, County Monaghan, Ireland. He was commissioned by Lieutenant General The 11th Baron Blayney to improve the demesne or park surrounding the &#x27;castle&#x27; in the early 1830s.

==Author==
In 1832, Gilpin published &quot;Practical Hints upon Landscape Gardening: with some remarks on Domestic Architecture, as connected with scenery&quot;, which ran to a second edition in 1835.

<text>Dunglish (portmanteau of &quot;Dutch&quot; and &quot;English&quot;; in , literally: &quot;coal-English&quot;) is a popular term for an English spoken with a mixture of Dutch. It is often viewed pejoratively due to certain typical mistakes that native Dutch speakers, particularly those from the Netherlands, make when speaking English. The term is first recorded in 1965, with other colloquial portmanteau words including &quot;Denglish&quot; (recorded from 1983), &quot;Dutchlish&quot; (1986), and &quot;Dinglish&quot; (2003).

English instruction in the Netherlands and Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, begins at an early age and continues as a basic school subject thereafter, with a number of university courses and programs entirely in English. English-language films are usually subtitled rather than dubbed. This education and exposure results in a relatively high general competence in English, yet mistakes are made.

The Dutch word for the poorest form of Dunglish, &quot;steenkolenengels&quot; (&quot;Coal English&quot;), dates to about 1900 when Dutch port workers used a rudimentary form of English to communicate with the crews of English coal ships.

Errors occur mainly in pronunciation, word order, stress laid on the wrong syllables, and the meaning of words, so-called false friends and false cognates. Former Dutch ambassador and prime minister Dries van Agt supposedly once said &quot;I can stand my little man&quot; (translation of &quot;ik kan mijn mannetje staan&quot;, a Dutch idiom meaning roughly &quot;I can stand up for myself&quot;). The former leader of the Dutch Liberal Party (VVD), Frits Bolkestein, repeatedly referred to economic prospects as &quot;golden showers&quot;, unaware of the term&#x27;s sexual connotation.

==Incorrect meaning of words==
Errors often occur because of the false friend or false cognate possibility: words are incorrectly translated for understandable reasons. Examples are:
* Former prime minister Joop den Uyl once remarked that &quot;the Dutch are a nation of undertakers&quot;. The Dutch verb &quot;ondernemen&quot; is literally the English &quot;to undertake&quot; (as &quot;onder&quot; is &quot;under&quot;, and &quot;nemen&quot; is &quot;take&quot;). The noun &quot;ondernemer&quot; is thus literally &quot;undertaker&quot; (which usually refers to a mortician); however, Uyl&#x27;s intended English meaning was instead &quot;entrepreneur&quot;. (Dutch uses the more specific &quot;begrafenisondernemer&quot; for a funeral director.)
* Former prime minister Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy had a meeting with Winston Churchill in London. Gerbrandy entered the room and shook Churchill&#x27;s hand, saying: &quot;Good-day!&quot; Churchill responded: &quot;This is the shortest meeting I have ever had&quot;. Gerbrandy had looked up the English translation of &quot;goedendag&quot;, which in Dutch is often used as a formal greeting, yet &quot;good day&quot; is most often used as valediction in Britain (as opposed to &quot;good morning&quot; or &quot;good afternoon&quot;).
* Dutch &quot;actueel&quot; means &quot;current&quot; (whereas &quot;actual&quot; in English means &quot;precise&quot; or &quot;genuine&quot;). A Dutch person unfamiliar with the English word might therefore be confused if they were asked about the &quot;actual time&quot; an event or appointment is supposed to start, or might misuse the word themselves.
* The Dutch verb &quot;solliciteren&quot; means &quot;apply for a job&quot;, while English &quot;solicit&quot; (and &quot;soliciting&quot; or &quot;solicited&quot;) can refer to prostitutes approaching clients; this can lead to an embarrassing situation if a native Dutch speaker states, in an English language context that they are soliciting or would like to solicit.
* The word &quot;eventueel&quot; in Dutch means &quot;potentially&quot; and not &quot;eventually&quot;, which is &quot;uiteindelijk&quot; in Dutch. This mistake caused a row between the Scottish and Belgian football associations when the Belgian football association invited delegates from various associations over for the &quot;eventual qualification of the Belgian national football team&quot; before the play-offs against Scotland started. While the Scottish federation accused the Belgians of sheer arrogance, the Belgian association had actually meant to hold the event after a &quot;possible&quot; qualification.

==Word order==

Some Dutch speakers may use Dutch syntax inappropriately when using English. These errors occur because English and Dutch do not apply exactly the same word order. 

Modern English has a subject‚Äìverb‚Äìobject word order, but this is shared only partially by Dutch, which has a verb-second order, causing the subject to follow the verb if another constituent already precedes it; e.g., &quot;Hij is daar&quot; (&quot;He is there&quot;), but &quot;Daar is hij&quot;; literally &quot;There is he&quot; (idiomatically, &quot;There he is&quot;).

Dutch also places perfect participles towards the end of a clause while the auxiliary remains at the verb-second position, allowing for the two to be separated and for many other elements to stand in between; e.g. &quot;Ik heb dat gisteren [meteen na de lunch toen ik aankwam etc.] gedaan&quot;; literally &quot;I have that yesterday [immediately after the lunch when I arrived etc.] done&quot;.

When asking questions, Dutch speakers may mirror the subject-verb inversion of archaic English grammar (e.g. &quot;‚ÄùWhat say you?‚Äù&quot;, &quot;‚ÄùWhat meanest thou?‚Äù&quot;) rather than using do-support as is preferred in contemporary English (e.g. &quot;‚ÄùWhat do you mean?‚Äù&quot;). This is because Dutch does not use periphrastic do-support, which is a rare feature cross-linguistically, but instead inverts the subject and verb when asking questions (e.g. ‚Äú&quot;Heb jij een fiets?&quot;‚Äù, literally ‚Äú&quot;have you a bicycle?&quot;‚Äù), as is common in the Germanic language family.

In English noun adjuncts, such as &quot;Schiphol&quot; in the phrase &#x27;Schiphol Meeting Point&#x27;, the modifying noun comes before the other noun. In Dutch this is the reverse, giving rise to errors like &quot;Meeting Point Schiphol&quot;.

==Compound nouns written as one word==
In English, only certain compound nouns (such as &quot;schoolteacher&quot;) can be written as one word, whereas in Dutch the default is to write compound nouns as a single word. This is witnessed in errors in English texts on signs ‚Äì at Schiphol Airport alone one can see signs for &quot;meetingpoint&quot;, &quot;boardingpass&quot; and &quot;traintickets&quot;. In some cases the English compound noun spelled as two words has been officially absorbed by the Dutch language as a single loanword ‚Äì as is the case with &quot;creditcard&quot; (credit card) and &quot;jetlag&quot; (jet lag).

==Verb conjugation==
English and Dutch are both West Germanic languages, with many cognate verbs with identical or nearly identical meanings. This similarity between verbs may cause speakers of Dutch to conjugate English verbs according to Dutch grammar.
* &quot;We kissen her.&quot; (Dutch &quot;kussen&quot; means and is cognate with English &quot;to kiss&quot;. In Dutch grammar, verbs with plural subjects take a form identical to the infinitive, which in most cases has an &quot;en&quot; suffix.)
* &quot;What do you now?&quot; for &quot;What are you doing right now?&quot; (In Dutch, &quot;Wat doe je nu?&quot;)
* &quot;How goes it now?&quot; for &quot;How are you doing now?&quot; (The phrase is used particularly after someone has had a bad spell. A similarly constructed phrase is found in Shakespeare (&quot;Othello&quot;, Act 4, Scene 3), carrying a slightly different meaning, which underlines the even closer similarities between English and Dutch historically.)

==Errors in pronunciation==
* Words like &quot;third&quot; and &quot;the&quot; are commonly mispronounced by Dutch speakers as &quot;turd&quot; and &quot;duh&quot; (cognate to Dutch &quot;de&quot;), replacing the dental fricative consonants &#x27;th&#x27; that are not present in Dutch with dental plosives, the nearest equivalent.
* Most Dutch speakers have trouble distinguishing between &quot;bat&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;bet&quot; and &quot;bed&quot; or between &quot;back&quot;, &quot;bag&quot;, &quot;beck&quot; and &quot;beg&quot;. This is because Dutch devoices obstruents at the end of a word. Dutch also does not distinguish between and .
* Some pronounce the word &quot;idea&quot; (in Dutch: &quot;idee&quot;) without the ending sound, making &quot;Do you have an idea?&quot; and &quot;Do you have an ID?&quot; sound the same.
* Most Dutch speakers do not voice the English &quot;v&quot; (that is, their vocal cords do not vibrate when they say it). In English, the labiodental fricative is &quot;f&quot; when unvoiced and &quot;v&quot; when voiced. In the modern Northern Standard Dialect of Dutch, &quot;v&quot; and &quot;z&quot; is often devoiced. This is particularly obvious when &quot;v&quot; or &quot;z&quot; begins a word. For example, many Dutch would pronounce &quot;video&quot; as /Ààf…™di…ô ä/, instead of /Ààv…™di…ô ä/, or &quot;van&quot; as /f√¶n/, instead of /v√¶n/, and &quot;zee&quot; as &quot;see&quot;.

==Other mistakes==
* Using &quot;greetings&quot; to close a letter. Caused by the literal translation of the Dutch closing phrase &quot;(met vriendelijke) groeten&quot;. In English, a greeting typically refers to the beginning of any type of exchange.
* Using the possessive form without a determiner. For example, &quot;the Lamborghini of Patrick&quot; instead of &quot;Patrick&#x27;s Lamborghini&quot;, or &quot;the computer of her&quot; instead of &quot;her computer&quot;.
* Using apostrophes to indicate plural nouns: &quot;car&#x27;s&quot; instead of &quot;cars&quot;.

==Use in media==
* A 2009 Dutch TV ad by the Eneco utility, promoting wind energy, poked fun at the Dutch people&#x27;s tendency to speak Dunglish.
* &quot;Make that the cat wise&quot;, originally started as a Facebook group poking fun at bad English translations by mock translating Dutch sayings, deliberately sticking to Dutch word order and use words that are homonyms in Dutch but not in English, thus creating English sentences that make no sense to native English speakers. The title &quot;Make that the cat wise&quot; is a mock translation of the Dutch saying &quot;Maak dat de kat wijs&quot; (try to convince the cat, i.e. don&#x27;t try to fool me). The publisher also sells calendars and agendas with this theme.

==Literature==
Dutch author Maarten H. Rijkens has written two books on the subject for Dutch readers: &quot;I always get my sin&quot; and &quot;We always get our sin too&quot;.

<text>All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well Too (Ëä±Áî∞Âñú‰∫ã) is a 1993 Hong Kong comedy film directed by Clifton Ko, and released as comedy fare as is the usual custom to entertain movie-goers on the Lunar New Year celebrations. The main setting is in the Song Dynasty and this reflects in the period costumes and architecture.

&quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well Too&quot; is part of a series of similarly titled films, together with &quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well&quot; (1992), of which it is not a sequel, &quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well 1997&quot; (1997), &quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well 2009&quot; (2009), and the similarly themed &quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well 2010&quot; (2010).

==Synopsis==

This comedy follows in tune with the series of films of the same name. Chow Tung (Samuel Hui) is a licentious man who was arranged to get married along with his ugly sister Gut (Sandra Ng) to partners not of their choice. Chow, being a filial son, agrees to go along with his mother&#x27;s (Ricky Hui) plans. The plot thickens when Chow meets the beautiful Snow White (Rosamund Kwan) and decides to marry her of which Matriarch Chow agrees whole-heartedly. Unknown to them, Snow White&#x27;s magician lover, David Cooper Feel (Leslie Cheung) schemes a plan and Chow Tung was married instead to Jinx (Teresa Mo).

The entire film uses mistaken identity as its central theme for comic effect, this theme is repeated for &quot;All&#x27;s Well, Ends Well Too 2010&quot;.

<text>2-WIM was the designation given, by Southern Railway (SR), to a 4-strong fleet of electric multiple units, dedicated for use on the ex-LBSCR West Croydon to Wimbledon Line, using the headcode 2. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class.

==Construction==
The 2-WIM (2-car Wimbledon stock, numbers 1809‚Äì1812) units were rebuilt in 1929, from former Trailer First cars, originally used in ex-LBSCR AC electric SL stock. They were intended for use on the line between Wimbledon and Croydon. Originally these units had some First Class accommodation in the Driving Motor car, but this was later declassified to Third Class only. The units were numbered 1909‚Äì1912 before 1936, when those numbers were reused for new 2-BIL units.

==Formations==
Initial formations of these units were as follows:
==Withdrawal==
All four units were withdrawn in 1954, and subsequently scrapped.

<text>Eravinalloor is a village in Kottayam district of Kerala state, India, situated from Kottayam town. The village is near Puthuppally and is located on the banks of the Kodoor River.

==Geography==
The small island-like village is surrounded by water. It is connected to the mainland by four bridges: the Puthuppally bridge to Puthuppally, the Eravinalloor bridge to Thrikkothamangalam, the scenic Parakkalkadavu bridge to Kollad lined with acacia trees, and the Panachikkad bridge to Panachikkad. The total area is less than .

==Religion==
The village has five temples of the deities. The Subramanya Swamy Temple has a circular sanctum sanctorum, which is unusual for the Dravidian style of temple architecture. The Panachikad Temple is situated away from Eravinalloor. The Our Lady Of Assumption Church represents the Catholic Church in Eravinalloor.

==History==
Historically, the land on which Eravinalloor is situated was donated to the Kadamuri Narasimha Swami Temple by the king of Thekkumkur. Eravinallor was among five villages on the land (the others being Ancheri, Kadamuri, Thrikkothamangalam and Meenadom); the &#x27;lord Narasimha of Kadamuri Temple&#x27; was thus known as the &#x27;panchadesadipathi&#x27;, or &quot;lord of five lands&quot;.

==Schools==
There are two educational institutions in Eravinalloor: Century old (1912) lower primary school, situated near the Eravinalloor upper junction, and St. Thomas Upper Primary School (normally called &#x27;Achante School&#x27;). St. Thomas Upper Primary School was established by Christian priest Rev Fr Kochimoolayil Mani Elias. The Vivekodayam Sanskrit High School, dedicated to the study of Sanskrit, once existed in the village, but it was dismantled in the 1970s.

<doc id="1230001" wikidata="Q777662" url="?curid=1230001" title="Down Ampney">
<text>Down Ampney (pronounced &quot;Amney&quot;) is a medium-sized village located in Cotswold district in Gloucestershire, in England. The population taken at the 2011 census was 644.

It is off the A417 which runs between Cirencester and Faringdon (in Oxfordshire) on the A420, and about north of Cricklade, which is on the A419 which runs from Cirencester to Swindon, Wiltshire.

==History==
Down Ampney was notable in medieval times as one of the seats of the powerful Hungerford family, whose principal family seat was at Farleigh Hungerford, Somerset. The Down Ampney estate later passed from the Hungerford family to the Earls of St German (the Eliot Family).

===Ralph Vaughan Williams===
The Old Vicarage in Down Ampney was the birthplace in 1872 of composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, whose father, the Reverend Arthur Vaughan Williams (1834‚Äì1875), was vicar of All Saints. In 1906 the composer wrote a tune for the hymn &quot;Come Down, O Love Divine&quot; which he titled &quot;Down Ampney&quot; in honour of his birthplace.

===RAF Down Ampney===
During the Second World War, RAF Down Ampney airfield was a base for Dakota aircraft seeing active service in the war. The airfield played an important role in the Battle of Arnhem, 1944.

==Governance==
Down Ampney has a Parish Council, currently with 7 members. 

As of May 2015 the village became part of &#x27;The Ampneys and Hampton Ward&#x27; on Cotswold District Council. The current District Councillor is Liberal Democrat Lisa Spivey who was elected in the 2019 United Kingdom local elections. 

Ampney Crucis is part of the wider South Cerney electoral division for elections to Gloucestershire County Council, the current County Councillor is Conservative Shaun Parsons who was elected in the 2017 United Kingdom local elections.

==All Saints&#x27; Church==
All Saints&#x27; Church is an ancient building that was founded by the Knights Hospitaller in 1265. It lies on the edge of the village; its peripheral location was brought about when the centre of the village shifted north due to the effects of the bubonic plague.

Its prominent spire dates from the 14th century, although much of the church fabric seen today is the product of Victorian restoration work carried out in 1863. 

The church contains a number of elaborate monuments to the Hungerford family, including a 1637 Renaissance-style monument to Sir John and Sir Anthony Hungerford.
Among the medieval memorials are two recumbent effigy tombs of Sir Nicholas de Valers (d.1300) and Lady Margaret de Valers (d.1320). The wooden fittings in the church, including the pulpit, reredos, and rood screen were designed in 1898 by Charles Ponting. Another screen in the north transept screen dates from 1900 and incorporating painted Jacobean panels displaying the coat of arms of Sir Anthony Hungerford. Today the church is a Grade I listed building. There is also a 20th-century stained-glass window in commemoration of 271 Sqn and the R.A.S.C who flew in the Dakota aircraft from the airfield for the Battle of Arnhem in 1944. The church holds an annual Arnhem Service in memory of the wartime operation. Another stained-glass is dedicated to the memory of Rev, Arthur Vaughan Williams who is buried in the churchyard.

The church featured in the 2017 Channel 4 television programme &quot;Penelope Keith&#x27;s Hidden Villages&quot;.

==Amenities==
In addition to the church and the airfield, the village has a school which is more than 150 years old, a multi-use games area for younger residents, a tennis club, a village hall and a small village shop.

The Down Ampney estate, comprising almost all of the farm land in the parish, is now owned by the Co-operative Group.

<text>The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 2-SL to the small fleet of electric multiple units dedicated for use on the South London lines. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class. In Southern Railway/Region days, they mainly spent their lives as 2-car units on the ex-LBSCR Wimbledon-West Croydon Line (now Croydon Tramway) with head code 2. They were distinctive, because they retained their flat roofs over the driving cabs, where the pantographs were originally situated.

==Construction==
The 2-SL (2-car South London stock, numbers 1801‚Äì1808) units were rebuilt in 1929 from the Driving Motor cars originally used in ex-LBSCR AC electric SL stock. They were intended for use on the South London lines. Originally, these units had some First Class accommodation in the Driving Trailer car, but this was later declassified to Third Class only. The units were numbered 1901‚Äì1908 before 1936, when those numbers were reused for new 2-BIL units. At the same time, 4-SUB unit number 1801 was renumbered 1600.

==Formations==
Initial formations of these units were as follows:
==Withdrawal==
The majority of these units were withdrawn in 1954, the exceptions being 1802 (in 1951) and 1807 (destroyed in 1940 during a World War II air raid). All were subsequently scrapped.

<text>The Bayfield River is a river in Huron and Perth Counties in southwestern Ontario, Canada, that empties into Lake Huron at the community of Bayfield in the municipality of Bluewater.

The river and community are named after Henry Wolsey Bayfield who surveyed the area in the early 19th century.

==Course==
The river begins just south of the community of Dublin in West Perth, Perth County at the confluence of the Cooke Drain and the Liffey Ditch. The river flows immediately west under Perth County Road 180 and takes in the left tributary McGrath Drain. It continues west northwest taking the left tributary Tyndall Drain and then the right tributary Silver Creek at the community of Egmondville, today part of the community of Seaforth in the municipality of Huron East, Huron County. It continues west northwest and takes in the left tributary Broadfoot Drain, and right tributaries Carnochan Drain and Helgrammite Creek before passing under Ontario Highway 4 between the community Clinton in Central Huron to the north and the community of Vanastra in Huron East, to the south. The river then turns southwest and takes in the right tributary Tricks Creek, heads south and takes in the left tributaries Wiltse Creek and Bannockburn River, and then turns sharply west just north of the community of Varna in Bluewater. It takes in the right tributaries Middletons Creek and Brandt Creek before passing under Ontario Highway 21 and reaching its mouth at Lake Huron in Bayfield.

<doc id="1230050" wikidata="Q193702" url="?curid=1230050" title="Walter Samuel">
<text>Walter Adri√°n Samuel (; born Walter Adri√°n Luj√°n; 23 March 1978) is an Argentine former professional footballer. Samuel has been regarded as one of the best centre-backs of his generation, and as one of football&#x27;s toughest defenders, with former international teammate and Inter captain Javier Zanetti referring to him as the &quot;hardest player&quot; he has played with.

Samuel began his club career with domestic club Newell&#x27;s Old Boys in 1996, later moving to Boca Juniors the following year. This was soon followed by a move to Europe in 2000, and spells with Italian club Roma, and Spanish club Real Madrid. In 2005, he returned to Italy, joining Inter, where he remained for nine seasons, winning five consecutive Serie A titles; he played a key role in the club&#x27;s treble success in the 2009‚Äì10 season, partnering with L√∫cio in defence under Jos√© Mourinho. At an international level, he has accumulated over 50 caps for the Argentina national team, representing his country at two FIFA World Cups, the 1999 Copa Am√©rica, and the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he won a runners-up medal.

==Early life and personal life==
He was born Walter Luj√°n, making his professional debut for Newell&#x27;s and playing the World Youth Cup under that name. He later took the last name of his stepfather, √ìscar Samuel. He has two sisters.

Samuel is married to Cecilia. They have two sons and a daughter.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Samuel started playing professionally in 1996 in Argentina for Newell&#x27;s Old Boys, and a year later moved to Boca Juniors, where he played 103 matches and scored five goals in all competitions until 2000. In that year, Roma bought his contract for 40.265 billion Italian lire (about ‚Ç¨20 million). He gained fame as one of the best defenders in the Italian league and gained a nickname to match, winning the Serie A title with Roma in 2001. His quality attracted interest from Spanish team Real Madrid.

Real Madrid paid ‚Ç¨25 million for his transfer in 2004. Samuel failed to make an impact at Madrid. He was one of the three non-EU players of the team, along with Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos; they all obtained Spanish passports, however, in 2005.

===Inter Milan===
In August 2005, he returned to the Serie A with a transfer to Inter Milan on a four-year contract for reported ‚Ç¨16 million fee. He began his Inter adventure by winning the 2005 Supercoppa Italiana versus Juventus, entering in 63rd minute as &quot;Nerazzurri&quot; won at extra-time thanks to the winner of Ver√≥n. Later on 21 September, he made his league debut for his new side by starting in the 1‚Äì0 away win over Chievo. On 24 November, during a Champions League group stage match against Petr≈æalka, Samuel played in a line-up of 11 foreign players on the pitch, with Lu√≠s Figo being the only european. He finished his first season at Inter by making 42 appearances in all competitions, with the team winning the championship following the relegation of Juventus due to match-fixing, and Coppa Italia by defeating Roma 4‚Äì2 on aggregate, with Samuel playing on both finals, thus completing an unforeseen domestic treble.
In the Derby della Madonnina on 23 December 2007, Samuel hurt himself whilst marking the Brazilian international Kak√°, and a couple weeks later, he had reconstructive surgery on his anterior cruciate ligament. He was expected to be out until the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. In actuality, he started training with the first team again in October of the 2008‚Äì09 season and promptly earned a first team place back under manager Jos√© Mourinho. He played his first match in more than nine months on 9 November by starting in the 1‚Äì0 home win over Udinese.

Samuel was one of the most important players under Mourinho in the 2009‚Äì10 season, partnering L√∫cio in defence as they won the Serie A title, the Coppa Italia, and the UEFA Champions League, completing a historic treble. He scored his first goal of the season on 20 October in the third Champions League group stage match versus Dynamo Kyiv which prevented Inter from losing; he headed home a Wesley Sneijder cross to make it 2‚Äì2. This draw extended Inter winless run in the UEFA Champions League to eight matches.

Later on 9 January, Samuel scored a last-minute winner in the 4‚Äì3 win versus Siena by beating goalkeeper Gianluca Curci with a left-footed shot. His goal later resulted decisive as Inter won the title two points ahead of Roma. He played his 100th Serie A game for Inter later on 24 April in the 3‚Äì1 win over Atalanta. Samuel finished the season by making 42 appearances and scoring 4 goals; he was praised for his defensive performances against Barcelona and Bayern Munich on Inter&#x27;s road to the Champions League title.

Samuel suffered a severe knee injury - a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament, this time on his other knee - on 7 November 2010 fixture against Brescia. This forced him to miss the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup triumph in United Arab Emirates. He returned in action on 15 May of the following year by entering in the last minutes of a 1‚Äì1 away draw versus Napoli. After the match Samuel expressed his delighting for playing his first match in almost six months, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m feeling good and I&#x27;m delighted at having been able to play the last few minutes of this match. I would like to thank the medical staff for the work they did after my injury, my family who has always stood by me, and all the fans.&quot; He finished the 2010‚Äì11 season by making 15 appearances in all competitions.

On 5 February 2012, Samuel played his 500th match as a professional in the 4‚Äì0 defeat at Roma. At the end of the season, he signed a new one-year contract with the club, lengthening his Inter career up to eight seasons. Later on 7 October, he scored inside three minutes in the derby versus Milan which resulted the winning goal, meaning that Samuel has won all 10 derbies that he has played. In June 2013, Samuel extended his contract for another season, in what would be his final season. He scored his first goal of the season on 9 February 2014, a header which resulted the winner in the match against Sassuolo for the first win of 2014.

Samuel wore the captain armband for the first time on 15 February 2014 in the 2‚Äì1 win at Fiorentina due to Javier Zanetti and Esteban Cambiasso being on bench. His final goal for the club came in the 4‚Äì0 win at Sampdoria in April 2014. Samuel left the club at the end of 2013‚Äì14 season, having made 236 appearances and winning 13 trophies in nine years. His last appearance for the club occurred on 10 May 2014 in the 4‚Äì1 home win over Lazio which gave the team a spot in UEFA Europa League next season.

===Basel===
After nine seasons with Inter, on 23 July 2014, Samuel signed a one-year contract with Basel in the Swiss Super League. He joined the team for their 2014‚Äì15 season under head coach Paulo Sousa. After playing in one test game Samuel played his debut for his new club in the Swiss Cup away game on 23 August 2014 as Basel won 4‚Äì0 against CS Italien (GE).&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-achiv-2014/15-Cup-CS Italien-FCB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He played his domestic league debut for the club in the home game in the St. Jakob-Park on 31 August as Basel won 3‚Äì1 against Young Boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-achiv-2014/15-FCB-YB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Basel entered the Champions League in the group stage. They reached the knockout phase on 9 December 2014, as they managed a 1‚Äì1 draw at Anfield against Liverpool.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-2014/15-UCL-Liverpool-FCB&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; But they were knocked out of the competition by Porto in the round of 16. Samuel scored his first goal for his club in the last match of that season on 25 May 2015. It was a home game in the St. Jakob-Park and Basel won 4‚Äì3 against St. Gallen.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-achiv-2014/15-FCB-FCSG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Basel won the championship for the sixth time in a row.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-aktuell-2014/15-Championship&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2014‚Äì15 Swiss Cup Basel reached the final. However, for the third time in a row they finished as runners-up. Basel played a total of 65 matches (36 Swiss League fixtures, 6 Swiss Cup, 8 Champions League and 15 test matches). Under manager Paulo Sousa, Samuel totaled 26 appearances, 13 League, 1 Cup, 4 Champions League, as well 8 in test games. He scored 2 goals in these matches.

In June 2015, Samuel prolonged his contract with Basel for another year. However, on 16 October he communicated his intention to retire at the end of the 2015‚Äì16 season, due to physical difficulties. He made his 100th UEFA club competition appearance playing in the closing match of the 2015‚Äì16 UEFA Europa League group stage during the 1‚Äì0 away win in the INEA Stadion against Lech Pozna≈Ñ on 10 December 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;UEFA-2015/16-UEL-Lech-FCB-&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Samuel played the final match of his career in a 1‚Äì0 home defeat against Grasshoppers, on 25 May 2016, at the age of 38. At the end of the 2015‚Äì16 Super League season, under new head coach Urs Fischer, Samuel won the championship for the second time.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-aktuell-2015/16-championship&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During his two seasons with the club, Samuel played a total of 61 games for Basel scoring a total of four goals. 21 of these games were in the Swiss Super League, five in the Swiss Cup, 11 in the UEFA competitions (Champions League and Europa League) and 16 were friendly games. He scored two goals in the domestic league, one in the 2015‚Äì16 UEFA Europa League against Saint-√âtienne and the other was scored during the test games.

==International career==
Samuel was part of Argentina U20 which emerged victorious in the 1997 edition of FIFA U-20 World Cup. He made his debut in the tournament in the opening Group E match versus Hungary which was won 3‚Äì0, and went on to play in the remaining two matches as Argentina topped their group.

Samuel has played 56 matches for Argentina between 1999 and 2010, scoring five goals. He played for his country in the 2002 FIFA World Cup and the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as well as in the 1999 Copa Am√©rica, and in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, in which Argentina won a runners-up medal.

==Style of play==
Regarded as one of the best defenders of his generation, Samuel was a large, quick, powerful, and aggressive centre-back, who excelled in the air, both defensively, and as a goal threat on set pieces. His defensive skills, which included an excellent positional sense, an ability to read the game, as well as tough, tight marking, and hard tackling, made him extremely effective at anticipating opponents. His strong, consistent, and uncompromising style of play earned him the nickname &quot;Il Muro&quot; (&quot;The Wall&quot;). Despite his ability as a defender, his career was also marked by several injuries that affected his fitness.

==After football==

In August 2019, Samuel enrolled in the UEFA Pro Licence courses at Coverciano.
He is the assistant coach for Argentina and has held the position since 2019.

He was recently part of the Argentina managerial team who won the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar.

<text>Hato Rey (Spanish for &quot;king‚Äôs cattle farm&quot;), often considered the central business district of Puerto Rico, is an urbanized financial, commercial, and residential district in San Juan, the capital municipality of the archipelago and island. Located at the center of the main metropolitan area and divided into the three barrios of Hato Rey Norte, Hato Rey Central and Hato Rey Sur, it is about from the Old San Juan historic quarter, Condado and Isla Verde resort areas, and SJU airport. Hato Rey is home to the Milla de Oro financial district, Jos√© Miguel Agrelot Coliseum, Hiram Bithrom Stadium, Telumundo International television network headquarters, and Plaza Las Am√©ricas shopping mall, among others. It was formerly a barrio of the dissolved municipality of R√≠o Piedras, which was merged with San Juan in 1951.
==Urban landscape==
Its name means &quot;king&#x27;s cattle farm&quot; (&quot;&quot;). In the 18th century, cattle would roam among the sugar cane fields in the area. Its proximity to residential areas such as San Juan, R√≠o Piedras, Miramar made it a perfect location from where to produce what its residents would eat. The area also used to be known as Las Monjas (the nuns) due to a convent that used to be located in the area in the 19th century.

The Northern portion of Hato Rey is a startling contrast between blight and poverty and &quot;La Milla de Oro&quot; (The Golden Mile), a stretch that effectively covers only one mile but that is home to the headquarters of many large local and international banks. It is one of the most important centers of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean&#x27;s economy and many upper middle class condominiums are also located here.

Hato Rey is also home to a series of boutiques and restaurants (mostly along Roosevelt Avenue). The Jos√© Miguel Agrelot Coliseum and the &quot;Tren Urbano&quot; metro system have also reshaped Hato Rey by bringing people and business into the area after work hours. The metro system is also helping to ease traffic woes in the area by decongesting the roads. Phi Sigma Alpha fraternity&#x27;s main headquarters are located in Mexico Street in Hato Rey. The Hato Rey Lions Club, founded in 1955, is located in Alhambra Street, across from the Polytechnic University.

Because of its location, many commuters travelling to Old San Juan must drive through Hato Rey.

==Economy==
Important buildings in Hato Rey include the Banco Popular headquarters, which in 1965 was the tallest building in Hato Rey. Plaza Las Am√©ricas, a large mall is located in Hato Rey, as is the Roberto Clemente Coliseum. Puerto Rico&#x27;s FBI headquarters are also located in Hato Rey. Because of the area&#x27;s closeness to the airport, major airlines, such as Avianca, have offices in Hato Rey.

Compaq at one point operated its Puerto Rico offices in Hato Rey.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Federal Office Building, a U.S. Federal Courthouse, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) San Juan field office are in Hato Rey.

The Puerto Rico Department of Education is headquartered in Hato Rey.

<text>Drogeham () is a village of about 1,700 inhabitants in the Dutch province of Friesland.

It is in a rural area of the municipality of Achtkarspelen. Agriculture still plays an important part in the town, but small-scale industry is on the increase. Many people have their jobs in nearby larger towns like Drachten, Surhuisterveen, and Leeuwarden. The most common language is still West Frisian although there are more and more people coming to Drogeham who have Dutch as their mother-tongue.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1475 as Asterham, Drogheham, and means dry land in a bend of a stream. Drogeham developed to the west of the monastery of .

<doc id="1230055" wikidata="Q1505099" url="?curid=1230055" title="Dobre Miasto">
<text>Dobre Miasto (; ; literally Good City) is a town in Poland, in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship with 9,857 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is situated in the northwestern part of the Masurian Lake District in the heart of the historical region of Warmia. It is also the seat of Dobre Miasto Commune which consists of the main town and 21 village administrative divisions, with a total population of 16,014.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

Dobre Miasto was founded on the place of a destroyed Old Prussian settlement. It received German town privileges on 26 December 1329. The name of the town was spelled in different ways: Guddestat, Godenstat, Gudinstat, Gutberg, Gutenstat, Guthenstadt, Guthinstadt.
The Latin name of the region (Pogesania) was derived from the Old Prussian word &quot;gudde&quot; (a bush/thicket). It is possible that the name of the town originated from this word. The Teutonic Order changed the Old Prussian pronunciation of the name into &quot;Guttstadt&quot;. However, as early as in 1336 the Latin translation of the name appeared - &quot;Bona Civitas&quot;. The Polish name is a literal translation from the German language, and historically it was spelled both &quot;Dobre Miasto&quot; and &quot;Dobremiasto&quot;. In English both Guttstadt and Dobre Miasto mean &quot;good town&quot;.

The first burgomaster of the town was Wilhelm von Wormditt. The coat of arms of the town was a deer holding an oak-twig with two acorns. The town tinctures were white (argent) and green (vert). The patron of the town was Saint Catherine of Alexandria.

In 1347 a Collegiate Chapter was transferred here from G≈Çotowo (&quot;Glotau&quot;), which event was of great importance for further development of Guttstadt. In the course of the following decades, the canons erected a church, a parish school and a hospital. The town, similarly as the whole region of Warmia, was the scene of different war campaigns. In 1440 the town joined the Prussian Confederation, which opposed the Teutonic Order, and at the request of which in 1454 King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the town and region to China. The town recognized the Polish King as rightful ruler shortly after and pledged allegiance in ElblƒÖg. In the peace treaty signed in Toru≈Ñ in 1466, Warmia and Dobre Miasto were finally renounced by the Teutonic Knights and recognized as part of Poland. Administratively it was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia in the province of Royal Prussia in the larger Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown.

===Modern era===

In 1538 Nicolaus Copernicus visited the town when he accompanied Bishop Johannes Dantiscus. The 16th century was a period of peace, which ended abruptly with Swedish invasion in 1626. The Swedes overran the town several times but the inhabitants suffered most severely during the Deluge in the years 1655-1660.

In 1772 the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Partition of Poland. The population of the town numbered 1831. In 1807 Guttstadt was seized in turn by the French, the Prussians and the Russians. In the Battle of Guttstadt-Deppen on 5 and 6 June 1807, the Russian army under General Levin August, Count von Bennigsen attacked Marshal Michel Ney&#x27;s French corps. Though badly outnumbered, Ney conducted an effective rear-guard action and escaped to the southwest across the Pas≈Çƒôka River with most of his troops. Napoleon Bonaparte spent a night in the Collegiate between 8 and 9 June 1807. The Collegiate chapter was dissolved and its properties were parcelled out on the strength of the edict issued by King Frederick William III of Prussia on 5 October 1810. In the years 1830-1834 the evangelical church was erected, mainly thanks to the donations of Frederick William III.

It was not until 1812 that three Jewish families were allowed to settle in Guttstadt. In 1814 they bought land for a Jewish cemetery. In 1855, the town&#x27;s synagogue was consecrated - serving the 240 community members.

During World War II, Guttstadt was 65% destroyed during its capture by the Soviet Red Army and the NKVD. After the Potsdam Conference the town was again handed over to Poland and renamed to its historic Polish name &quot;Dobre Miasto&quot;. The town&#x27;s German population was expelled towards the remainder of Germany, and many Poles displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union settled in the town. On 1 August 1945, a Soviet garrison handed over power to Jan Majdecki, the first post-war mayor of the town.

<text>&quot;Paperback Writer&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. Written primarily by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney partnership, the song was released as the A-side of their eleventh single in May 1966. It topped singles charts in the United Kingdom, the United States, Ireland, West Germany, Australia, New Zealand and Norway. On the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the song was at number one for two non-consecutive weeks, being interrupted by Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;.

&quot;Paperback Writer&quot; was the last new song by the Beatles to be featured on their final tour in 1966, and debuted globally on the 1966 compilation album &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot;, except in the United States and Canada, where it debuted on the 1970 collection &quot;Hey Jude&quot;.

==Background and inspiration==
&quot;Paperback Writer&quot; was largely written by Paul McCartney, who based the lyrics on a challenge made to him by his Aunt Lil. McCartney said in 1966: &quot;Years ago, my Auntie Lil said to me, &#x27;Why do you always write songs about love all the time? Can&#x27;t you ever write about a horse or the summit conference or something interesting?&#x27; So, I thought, &#x27;All right, Auntie Lil.&#x27;&quot; According to Radio Luxembourg DJ Jimmy Savile&#x27;s recollection, the inspiration for the song came backstage at a concert venue when McCartney, mindful of his aunt&#x27;s request, saw Ringo Starr reading a book and declared his intention to write a song about a book.

The lyrics are in the form of a letter from an aspiring author addressed to a publisher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fontenot/About&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney completed the song with John Lennon in response to pressure from EMI for a new Beatles single in April 1966, early on in the sessions for the band&#x27;s &quot;Revolver&quot; album. Intrigued by the rhythmic possibilities of the phrase &quot;paperback writer&quot;, McCartney came up with the framework for the song during his hour-long drive from London to Lennon&#x27;s house in Surrey.

Discussing &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; with Alan Smith of the &quot;NME&quot; that year, McCartney recalled that he and Lennon wrote the lyrics in the form of a letter beginning with &quot;Dear Sir or Madam&quot;, but that the song was not inspired by &quot;any real-life characters&quot;. However, according to a 2007 piece in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, McCartney said he started writing the song in 1965 after reading in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; about an aspiring author, &quot;possibly Martin Amis&quot; (who would have been a teenager at the time). The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was Lennon&#x27;s regular newspaper and copies were in Lennon&#x27;s Weybridge home when Lennon and McCartney were writing songs.

Aside from deviating from the subject of love, McCartney had it in mind to write a song with a melody backed by a single, static chord. &quot;John and I would like to do songs with just one note like &#x27;Long Tall Sally.&#x27; We got near it in &#x27;The Word. McCartney claimed to have barely failed to achieve this goal with &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, as the verse remains on G until the end, at which point it pauses on C.

Lennon told &quot;Hit Parader&quot; in 1972 that &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; was primarily written by McCartney: &quot;I think I might have helped with some of the lyrics. Yes, I did. But it was mainly Paul&#x27;s tune.&quot; Speaking in 1980, Lennon described &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; as &quot;son of &#x27;Day Tripper&#x27; ‚Äì meaning a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll song with a guitar lick on a fuzzy, loud guitar ‚Äì but it is Paul&#x27;s song&quot;.

==Recording==
The Beatles recorded &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; at EMI Studios in London on 13 and 14 April 1966. The 14 April session was attended by a photographer from &quot;Beatles Monthly&quot;, while EMI engineer Phil McDonald&#x27;s handwritten notes similarly documented the band&#x27;s experimentation with overdubs on the basic track. In the search for a suitable arrangement, George Harrison briefly switched to bass guitar, and producer George Martin contributed on tack piano, sent through a Leslie speaker, and on Vox Continental organ, none of which were retained in the completed track.

&quot;Paperback Writer&quot; is marked by the boosted bass guitar sound, which was partly in response to Lennon demanding to know why the bass on a certain Wilson Pickett record exceeded that on any Beatles records. Geoff Emerick, who had been promoted to the role of the Beatles&#x27; recording engineer for &quot;Revolver&quot;, later said: &quot;&#x27;Paperback Writer&#x27; was the first time the bass sound had been heard in all its excitement. Paul played a different bass, a Rickenbacker. Then we boosted it further by using a loudspeaker as a microphone. We positioned it directly in front of the bass speaker and the moving diaphragm of the second speaker made the electric current.&quot; McCartney&#x27;s playing was also more melodic and busy than on previous tracks.

According to McCartney, the harmony vocals on the track were arranged during the recording session. Martin later commented: &quot;The way the song itself is shaped and the slow, contrapuntal statements from the backing voices ‚Äì no one had really done that before.&quot; In their backing vocals over the third verse, Lennon and Harrison sing the title of the French nursery rhyme &quot;Fr√®re Jacques&quot;.

Emerick stated that the &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; / &quot;Rain&quot; single was cut louder than any other Beatles record up to that time, due to a new piece of equipment used in the mastering process, referred to as &quot;Automatic Transient Overload Control&quot;, which was devised by the EMI maintenance department.

==Promotion==
In Britain, the single was promoted with a photograph depicting the Beatles draped with pieces of raw meat and decapitated baby dolls. This photograph was later used, albeit briefly, as the &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; album cover in the US, and in that capacity it became known as the &quot;butcher cover&quot;. For the American release of the single, the picture sleeve showed the Beatles playing live, but with Lennon and Harrison&#x27;s images reflected so that it appeared they were playing left-handed.

Michael Lindsay-Hogg directed four promotional films for the song shot on 19 and 20 May 1966. On the first day they recorded a colour performance at EMI Studios, for &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, which was shown on 5 June, and two black-and-white performance clips for British television. The latter aired on &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; and &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; on 3 and 25 June, respectively. The Beatles also filmed a personal introduction to Ed Sullivan with their faces hidden behind colour transparencies of the butcher cover.

On 20 May, a second colour film was made at Chiswick House in west London. The Beatles mimed to the song, and they were shown in a statue garden and inside the conservatory in the grounds of the house. The clip was first broadcast in black and white on BBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 2 June. The 20 May promo clip was included in the Beatles&#x27; 2015 video compilation &quot;1&quot;, and both the 19 May colour film and the 20 May film were included in the three-disc versions of the compilation, titled &quot;1+&quot;.

The Beatles appeared on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to mime to &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; on 16 June. This television appearance ‚Äì which was the Beatles&#x27; only &quot;in person&quot; appearance on the BBC&#x27;s flagship pop music show of the era ‚Äì was subsequently lost due to the BBC&#x27;s habit of wiping expensive video tape for reuse, leading to efforts by the corporation to find an original copy. In 2019, a collector unearthed 11 seconds of the performance; a longer 92 seconds&#x27; worth was found later in the year.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Paperback Writer&quot; was issued as a single in the US by Capitol Records on 30 May 1966, with the catalogue number 5651 and &quot;Rain&quot; as the B-side. The UK release, on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label, took place on 10 June, with the catalogue number R 5452. It was the Beatles&#x27; first UK single since the &quot;Day Tripper&quot; / &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; double A-side in December 1965. Other than their brief performance at the annual &quot;NME&quot; Pollwinners Concert on 1 May, promotion for the new record was also the first sign of public activity by the band since the start of the year.

Reviewing the single for the &quot;NME&quot;, Derek Johnson said that &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; &quot;swings along at a thundering pace&quot;, with McCartney&#x27;s lead vocal &quot;aided by some startling chanting&quot;. He admired Starr&#x27;s &quot;cymbal bashing&quot; and concluded, &quot;those sudden breaks in tempo help to increase the impact.&quot; In &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot;, Penny Valentine said the song had a &quot;marvellous dance beat&quot; and was &quot;very striking&quot; due to its &quot;break-up drumming and ethereal surf chorus&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot;‚Ä≥s reviewer wrote that with a new Beatles single, &quot;the rush is on&quot;, and commented on the band&#x27;s use of &quot;interesting electronic effects to good effect&quot;, while &quot;Cash Box&quot; predicted that the group would easily continue their run of &quot;blockbuster&quot; singles and described the A-side as &quot;a rhythmic, pulsating ode with an infectious repeating riff all about the creative urge&quot;. A later review in 2016 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; lauded the song&#x27;s innovation in paving the way to &quot;Revolver&quot;, opining that &quot;from the get-go, there is something otherworldly about Paperback Writer.&quot;

The more widely held view was one of disappointment, according to author Peter Doggett, and dismissal as &quot;a brash, insubstantial throwaway&quot;. Writing in &quot;The Beatles: An Illustrated Record&quot;, &quot;NME&quot; critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler described &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; as &quot;the first Beatles single to receive less-than-universal acclaim&quot;, saying that it was &quot;perhaps a trifle too &#x27;clever&#x27;&quot; and criticism was focused on &quot;the triviality of the lyric and a slight nagging suspicion that the Beatles were playing at &#x27;being songwriters&#x27; at a time when the world was waiting for The Word&quot;. The band&#x27;s apparent aloofness also alienated many of their fans, who wrote into &quot;Record Mirror&quot; to disparage the group&#x27;s new music. The UK music press were similarly offended by the ads for the single, which included a second &quot;butcher&quot; photo appearing in full colour on the cover of &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot;, accompanied by the caption &quot;Beatles: What a Carve-Up!&quot; In author Nicholas Schaffner&#x27;s description, this image led &quot;one crusty columnist to rail against the importation of American &#x27;sick humor&#x27; into the United Kingdom&quot;.

Such was the Beatles&#x27; status, they were scrutinised in the press when, like &quot;Day Tripper&quot; / &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, the single failed to top all of the UK&#x27;s sales charts straightaway. On the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; chart (subsequently adopted as the UK Singles Chart), &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; entered at number 2, behind Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;, before taking the top position the following week. On the national chart compiled by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the song debuted at number 1, remaining there for a total of four weeks. Amid a climate of failing domestic economy, despite the country&#x27;s strong exports through music, the record&#x27;s UK sales were the lowest for any Beatles single since &quot;Love Me Do&quot; in 1962.

In the US, &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two non-consecutive weeks. It replaced the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Paint It Black&quot; and was then deposed by Sinatra&#x27;s single for a week before returning to number 1. It was certified as a gold record by the Recording Industry Association of America on 14 July. The single also topped the charts in Australia, West Germany and many other countries around the world.

The song&#x27;s release coincided with London being feted by the US media as the &quot;Swinging City&quot; of international culture. In his book on the 1960s, social historian Arthur Marwick says the Beatles represented the popular image of a phenomenon in which &quot;hitherto invisible swathes of British society became visible and assertive&quot; and &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; was the song that best conveyed &quot;the new class-defying tide of individualistic enterprise&quot;.

&quot;Paperback Writer&quot; was the only new song the Beatles included in their 1966 tour setlist. Their inability to reproduce the layered vocal effect of the studio recording was a source of embarrassment for the group, however. 

In addition to moulding their characters and sound on the Beatles, the Monkees used &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; as the basis for their debut single, &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot;.

==Subsequent releases and other versions==
A stereo mix of &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; was first carried out in late October 1966 for inclusion on the UK compilation album &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot; and then appeared in an alternate stereo mix on the 1970 US compilation album &quot;Hey Jude&quot;. Following the Beatles&#x27; break-up, the song was included on compilations such as &quot;1962‚Äì1966&quot; (1973), &quot;Past Masters, Volume Two&quot; (1988) and &quot;1&quot; (2000). In 1995, a mix featuring only vocals was among several tracks that were in the running for inclusion on the three &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; compilation albums but were ultimately passed over.

The single was released as part of a Record Store Day reissue in 2010. &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; was included on the Beatles&#x27; 2012 iTunes compilation &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, which the band&#x27;s website described as a collection of &quot;the Beatles&#x27; most influential rock songs&quot;.

Other artists who have recorded the track include the Bee Gees, the Charles River Valley Boys, the Cowsills, Floyd Cramer, Eric Johnson, Kris Kristofferson, Kenny Rogers, the Shadows, Sweet, Dayd√©, Tempest and 10cc. McCartney has often played the song in concert. Live versions appear on his 1993 album &quot;Paul Is Live&quot; and 2009 album &quot;Good Evening New York City&quot;.

==Personnel==

There is some dispute over who played what on &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;. In the July 1990 and the November 2005 issues of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine, McCartney stated that he played the song&#x27;s opening riff on his Epiphone Casino guitar, and photos from the recording session seem to be consistent with this. In the 2005 edition of his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, Ian MacDonald gives Harrison as the sole lead guitarist, and Kenneth Womack similarly lists McCartney only on bass and lead vocal. Robert Rodriguez and Walter Everett each credit McCartney as the player of the song&#x27;s main guitar riff, and state that Harrison added lead guitar &quot;fills&quot; over his initial rhythm part.

The following line-up is per Rodriguez:

*Paul McCartney lead vocal, lead guitar (riff), bass
*John Lennon backing vocal, tambourine
*George Harrison backing vocal, rhythm guitar, lead guitar (fills)
*Ringo Starr drums

<text>Matheran is a partially automobile free hill station and a municipal council in the Karjat taluka of the Raigad district located in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Matheran is part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, and one of the smallest hill stations in India. It is located in the Western Ghats, at an elevation of around 800¬†m (2,625 feet) above sea level. It is about 90¬†km from Mumbai, and 120¬†km from Pune. This proximity to these urban areas makes it a weekend getaway for many. Matheran, which means &quot;forest on the forehead&quot; (of the mountains) in Marathi, is an eco-sensitive region, declared by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India. 

There are many hotels and Parsi bungalows in the area. Old British colonial architecture is preserved in Matheran. The roads are made of red laterite earth.

== History ==
Matheran was identified by Hugh Poyntz Malet, the then district collector of Raigad district in the May of 1850. Lord Elphinstone, the then Governor of Bombay laid the foundations of the development as a future hill station. The British developed Matheran as a getaway from the regional summer heat. It is also the birthplace of freedom fighter Veer Bhai Kotwal.

The Matheran Railway

The Matheran Hill Railway was built in 1907 by Sir Adamjee Peerbhoy and covers a distance of , through forest land. The railway was inspected by UNESCO officials, but failed to make it to the list of the World Heritage Sites. India&#x27;s other Hill Railways like the Darjeeling Railway, the Kangra Valley Railway, Nilgiri Mountain Railway are already on the list.

The Toy train was shut down for the most part in 2016 and 2017. It became re-operational since 26 January 2018 and was re-inaugurated by the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Mr. Devendra Fadnavis. However, it was temporarily suspended again after a landslide in the 2019. Thereafter, it operates shuttle rides between Aman Lodge and Matheran Station on an hourly basis and also an Battery Operated E-Rikshaw which runs from Aman Lodge to Matheran Market.

== Soil and rocks ==
Geographically the rock types are solely composed of Deccan trap with inter trappeans of Cretaceous, Eoceuerage and laterites of a still younger age. The rock is basalt, which has given rise to secondary alteration known as laterite. The laterite predominates the hills and almost covers the hilltops. This makes the hard exposed surfaces of the laterite show red gravelly earth. The soil has a vermicular or pisolitic structure and contains a large amount of water. There is little soil cover over most of the hilltop. The topmost layer of rock is a soft porous iron-clay, through which there is drainage of water by the beginning of summer.

== Forest and vegetation ==

Semi-evergreen forests are present in the Matheran. The trees are evergreen, making the plateau forests very dense and even congested in places. The laterite, porous soil along with very heavy rainfall mixed with dense fog has resulted in unique flora rich in diversity on the plateau. The forests show vegetation in top, middle and ground storeys. The trees form a cover over a large variety of shade-loving herbs, climbers, ferns and mosses. The forests of Matheran have attracted many botanists: Smyth J.Y.(1871), Birdwood H.M. (1886) and (1896), Cooke T. (1887‚Äì1901), Woodrow G.M. (1897‚Äì1901), Irani N.A.(1962), Satyanarayann &amp; Mudliar (1959), Vartak, V.D.(1966), Kothari &amp; Moorthy (1993). A good collection of the dried plants is deposited in the Blatter Herbarium, St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Bombay, Mumbai. Matheran has a huge number of medicinal plants and herbs. It was declared an Eco-Sensitive zone (ESZ) by the Union Environment Ministry on 4 February 2003. The declaration as ESZ has led to the stoppage of developmental activities and construction of hazardous industries.

=== List of trees reported to be found in Matheran ===


The vegetation of the area depends on the type and depth of the soil. Due to poor soil depth, the vegetation on the edges of the plateaus is poor. Due to heavy rainfall, dissected hilly terrain and excessive leaching of the soil, the exposed areas become less fertile and become less moisture retentive, resulting in shallow rooted vegetation. It is required to plant trees to protect the soil cover from losing its valuable humidity and fertility. The winds are very strong and blow from west or southwest during monsoon and also dry winds blow during the three months from January to March. These winds tend to shear and bend the plants while absorbing their moisture.

== Wildlife ==

The town also has a large monkey population, including bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs. Domesticated horses for riding are also in large numbers and are one of the icons of Matheran. Inside the forests, animals like barking deer, Malabar giant squirrels, foxes, wild boars, mongooses can be found. But these animals are rare in numbers compared to the monkeys and usually do not venture to places with human activity.

Leopard Sightings

There have been reports of leopard sightings in Matheran a few times in last decade. Leopards are not known to dwell in Matheran however. Dense forests in the valleys surrounding Matheran have been suspected of housing them. Their dwindling population in India however has led their sightings to be extremely rare nowadays.

<doc id="1230064" wikidata="Q2087633" url="?curid=1230064" title="Mpongwe people">
<text>The Mpongwe are an ethnic group in Gabon, notable as the earliest known dwellers around the estuary where Libreville is now located.

==History==
The Mpongwe language identifies them as a subgroup of the My√®n√® people of the Bantus, who are believed to have been in the area for some 2,000 years, although the Mpongwe clans likely began arriving in only the 16th century, possibly in order to take advantage of trading opportunities offered by visiting Europeans. The Mpongwe gradually became the middlemen between the coast and the interior peoples such as the Bak√®l√® and S√©k√©. From about the 1770s, the Mpongwe also became involved in the slave trade. In the 1830s, Mpongwe trade consisted of slaves, dyewood, ebony, rubber, ivory, and gum copal in exchange for cloth, iron, firearms, and various forms of alcoholic drink.

In the 1840s, at the time of the arrival of American missionaries and French naval forces, the Mpongwe consisted of 6,000-7,000 free persons and 6,000 slaves, organized into about two dozen clans. Four of these clans were preeminent; the Asiga and Agulamba on the south shore, and the Agekaza-Glass and Agekaza-Quaben on the north shore. Each of these clans was ruled by an &quot;oga&quot;, translated as &quot;king&quot; by Europeans, although clan leadership was largely oligarchic.

The Mpongwe engaged in extensive coastal trade across the Central African coast. An account of this trade includes that of Paul Du Chaillu in the mid-19th century. Mpongwe boats could be 60 feet in length, formula_1 in breadth and 3 feet deep. Larger vessels included masts and sails made of woven palm fronds, with a load capacity of 8‚Äì10 tons.
===French colonial rule===
The French took advantage of longstanding inter-clan rivalry to establish a foothold; while &quot;King Denis&quot; (Antchouw√© Kowe Rapontchombo) of the Asigas talked the French out of using his clan&#x27;s area, &quot;King Glass&quot; (R&#x27;Ogouarowe) of the Agekaza-Glass submitted only after a bombardment in 1845, and &quot;King Louis&quot; (Anguil√® R√©-Dow√©) of Agekaza-Quaben ceded his village of Okolo and moved, leaving the French to establish Fort d&#x27;Aumale on the village&#x27;s site in 1843.

The combination of slave trade suppression and direct contact by Europeans with the interior reduced Mpongwe fortunes, but at the same time missionary schools enabled young Mpongwe to work in the colonial government and enterprise. The population declined greatly as a result of smallpox, and an 1884 estimate lists only about 3,000 Mpongwe. Fang migration pressure converted many Mpongwe to urban life in the early 20th century, and they came to be leaders in both the French colony and independent Gabon.

===Social relations with Europeans===

As African and European communities converged along the coast, the Mpongw√© adjusted traditional practices to incorporate interracial relationships between Mpongw√© women and European men. By mid 19th century, it was commonplace for Mpongw√© women to engage in sexual and domestic acts with European men in exchange for a bridewealth. As a result of centuries of contact with the Europeans, a mixed-race population emerged: the m√©tis. M√©tis could be found in almost every Mpongw√© family during this time. Mpongw√© families even encouraged their daughters to engage with European men. Such unions were not considered legitimate marriages under French law, but were in Mpongw√© communities as long as family consent and a bridewealth were given. These marriages provided an avenue for women to acquire property and to obtain French citizenship. As these interracial unions continued into the 20th century, African and French societies sought to restrict these unions as Mpongw√© women began to claim their European ancestry as a means to assert their voice in society. The m√©tis population not only confronted gender roles within the African community, but also challenged the permeability of social and legal hierarchies under colonial rule.

<text>Panchgani, called Paachgani, is a hill station and municipal council in Satara district in Maharashtra, India. Panchgani attracts tourists throughout the year. It is also known for having many convent boarding schools.

Panchgani is around 108 kilometres from Pune and 250 kilometres from Mumbai.

==History==
Panchgani was developed by the British during the British Raj as a summer resort under the supervision of Lord John Chesson in the 1860s. Panchgani was developed as a retirement place because its climate remained pleasant throughout the year. He surveyed the hills of this region with Rustomji Dubash, Kondoba Biramane and finally decided on this nameless area around the five villages: Dandeghar, Godavali, Ambral, Khingar, and Taighat. The place was aptly named Panchgani, meaning &quot;land between five villages&quot;, and Chesson was made superintendent.

To develop the infrastructure, Chesson encouraged various professionals - tailors, dhobis, butchers, vegetable vendors, building contractors - to also settle in Panchgani. The area below the bazaar was allotted to them, and is now known as the &quot;gaothan&quot;. He is credited with planting plant species from the western world in Panchgani, including silver oak and poinsettia, which have flourished since then in Panchgani. Chesson is buried in the graveyard of St. Peter&#x27;s Church. In 1971 or &#x27;72, his death centenary was observed in a big way when for the first time, the town folk and the schools participated together in a ceremony to remember the founder of Panchgani.

===Boarding schools===
A number of schools were started in the 19th century across different communities, and Panchgani started flourishing as an educational town.

In the 1890s, Kimmins High School was started for European boys and girls. 1902, the boys&#x27; section separated to become European Boys High School, now known as St. Peter&#x27;s School, Panchgani, and Kimmins became an exclusive girls&#x27; school. In 1895, the Roman Catholic order of nuns known as &quot;Daughters of The Cross&quot; started St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent School, Panchgani. All three boarding schools were modeled on the English Public Schools of that time, and were affiliated to Cambridge University. The board exams would be held in December, the question papers being sent from England by sea. The answer papers were sent back by sea and the results were declared in June.

Shortly afterward, other communities started their schools. These schools were affiliated to matriculation examination of the Bombay Presidency. The Parsi School, the first of these schools, later became the Billimoria School. The Muslim School became the Union High School, and is now known as Anjuman-I-Islam School. Both these schools were modelled on the English Public Schools. Hindu High School was started, now known as the Sanjeewan Vidyalaya. This was modelled on Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s Shantiniketan. The National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of India runs the New Era High School. A retired teacher from the Parsi High School, Mr. S. M. Batha started the S.M. Batha School, Panchgani International School and junior College is also one of the Best School in Panchgani .

===Convalescence center===
The fresh air and invigorating climate of Panchgani made it a good place for convalescence. A well-known tuberculosis specialist from Bombay, Dr. Rustomji Bomanji Billimoria set up the Bel Air sanatorium, in the 1940s, as a centre for the treatment of TB. Till the advent of antibiotics, &quot;Dalkieth&quot; (Bel Air) was the premier place for the treatment of tuberculosis in the Bombay Presidency.

<text>The Johnsonville crater or the Snow&#x27;s Island crater is a circular geophysical feature situated at the junction of the Lynches River and the Pee Dee River in South Carolina, United States, which has been interpreted by some scientists as an impact crater. Snow&#x27;s Island, at that point, is believed to be the upthrust formed at the center of the crater after the impact. The structure is approximately in diameter, but is not well defined at the surface. It was discovered by magnetic anomalies, supported by the study of well drilling cores. Supposed impact breccia was found in these cores. The Russian Academy of Sciences lists the structure as a proven impact crater, though the Earth Impact Database (EID) does not list it as confirmed.

<text>The Maitland River is a river in Huron County, Perth County and Wellington County in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The river is in the Great Lakes Basin and empties into Lake Huron at the town of Goderich. It is long, and is named after Sir Peregrine Maitland, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada from 1818 to 1828. It was formerly known as the Menesetung River.

==Course==
The river begins in geographic Arthur Township in the municipality of Wellington North, Wellington County. It flows west into the municipality of Minto and its main centre, the community of Harriston, with its triple junction of Ontario Highway 9, Ontario Highway 23 and Ontario Highway 89. The river continues west into the municipality of Howick, Huron County, where it passes over two small dams, at Gorrie (maintained by the Maitland Valley Conservation Authority) and at Wroxeter (maintained by the community), passes through the municipality of Morris-Turnberry, and reaches the community of Wingham in the municipality of North Huron, where it passes over a dam and takes in the left tributary Middle Maitland River. The river then turns southwest and enters the municipality of Ashfield‚ÄìColborne‚ÄìWawanosh. From the community of Auburn to Goderich, the river forms the boundary between Ashfield‚ÄìColborne‚ÄìWawanosh and the municipality of Central Huron. The river continues southwest, takes in the left tributary South Maitland River, turns northwest, and reaches its mouth at Lake Huron at the town of Goderich.

==Natural history==
The lower Maitland (to Wingham) has a trout and salmon run, and is home to several species at risk including queen snake, wavy-rayed lampmussel and butternut tree, as well as several Carolinian forest species, including bitternut hickory, American sycamore, summer grape and green dragon.

<text>The Radcliffe Line was the boundary demarcated by the two boundary commissions for the provinces of Punjab and Bengal during the Partition of India. It is named after Cyril Radcliffe, who, as the joint chairman of the two boundary commissions, had the ultimate responsibility to equitably divide of territory with 88 million people.

The term &quot;Radcliffe Line&quot; is also sometimes used for the entire boundary between India and Pakistan. However, outside of Punjab and Bengal, the boundary is made of existing provincial boundaries and had nothing to do with the Radcliffe commissions.

The demarcation line was published on 17 August 1947, two days after the independence of Pakistan and India. Today, the Punjab part of the line is part of the India‚ÄìPakistan border while the Bengal part of the line serves as the Bangladesh‚ÄìIndia border.

==Background==
===Events leading up to the Radcliffe Boundary Commissions===

On 18 July 1947, the Indian Independence Act 1947 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom stipulated that British rule in India would come to an end just one month later, on 15 August 1947. The Act also stipulated the partition of the Presidencies and provinces of British India into two new sovereign dominions: India and Pakistan.

Pakistan was intended as a Muslim homeland, while India remained secular. Muslim-majority British provinces in the northwest were to become the foundation of Pakistan. The provinces of Baluchistan (91.8% Muslim before partition) and Sindh (72.7%) and North-West Frontier Province became entirely Pakistani territory. However, two provinces did not have an overwhelming Muslim majority‚ÄîPunjab in the northwest (55.7% Muslim) and Bengal in the northeast (54.4% Muslim). After elaborate discussions, these two provinces ended up being partitioned between India and Pakistan.

The Punjab&#x27;s population distribution was such that there was no line that could neatly divide the Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs. Likewise, no line could appease both the Muslim League, headed by Jinnah, and the Congress led by Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel. Moreover, any division based on religious communities was sure to entail &quot;cutting through road and rail communications, irrigation schemes, electric power systems and even individual landholdings.&quot;

===Prior ideas of partition===
The idea of partitioning the provinces of Bengal and Punjab had been present since the beginning of the 20th century. Bengal had in fact been partitioned by the then viceroy Lord Curzon in 1905, along with its adjoining regions. The resulting &#x27;Eastern Bengal and Assam&#x27; province, with its capital at Dhaka, had a Muslim majority and the &#x27;West Bengal&#x27; province, with its capital at Calcutta, had a Hindu majority. However, this partition of Bengal was reversed in 1911 in an effort to mollify Bengali nationalism.

Proposals for partitioning Punjab had been made starting in 1908. Its proponents included the Hindu leader Bhai Parmanand, Congress leader Lala Lajpat Rai, industrialist G. D. Birla, and various Sikh leaders. After the 1940 Lahore resolution of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, B. R. Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled &quot;Thoughts on Pakistan.&quot; In the tract, he discussed the boundaries of Muslim and non-Muslim regions of Punjab and Bengal. His calculations showed a Muslim majority in 16 western districts of Punjab and non-Muslim majority in 13 eastern districts. In Bengal, he showed non-Muslim majority in 15 districts. He thought the Muslims could have no objection to redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, &quot;they [did] not understand the nature of their own demand&quot;.
After the breakdown of the 1945 Simla Conference of viceroy Lord Wavell, the idea of Pakistan began to be contemplated seriously. Sir Evan Jenkins, the private secretary of the viceroy (later the governor of Punjab), wrote a memorandum titled &quot;Pakistan and the Punjab&quot;, where he discussed the issues surrounding the partition of Punjab. K. M. Panikkar, then prime minister of the Bikaner State, sent a memorandum to the viceroy titled &quot;Next Step in India&quot;, wherein he recommended that the principle of &#x27;Muslim homeland&#x27; be conceded but territorial adjustments made to the two provinces to meet the claims of the Hindus and Sikhs. Based on these discussions, the viceroy sent a note on the &quot;Pakistan theory&quot; to the Secretary of State for India . The viceroy informed the Secretary of State that Jinnah envisaged the &quot;full provinces&quot; of Bengal and Punjab going to Pakistan with only minor adjustments, whereas Congress was expecting &quot;almost half&quot; of these provinces to remain in India. This essentially framed the problem of partition.

The Secretary of State responded by directing Lord Wavell to send &#x27;actual proposals for defining genuine Muslim areas&#x27;. The task fell on V. P. Menon, the Reforms Commissioner, and his colleague Sir B. N. Rau in the Reforms Office. They prepared a note called &quot;Demarcation of Pakistan Areas&quot;, where they included the three western divisions of Punjab (Rawalpindi, Multan and Lahore) in Pakistan, leaving two eastern divisions of Punjab in India (Jullundur and Delhi). However, they noted that this allocation would leave 2.2 million Sikhs in the Pakistan area and about 1.5 million in India. Excluding the Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts of the Lahore Division from Pakistan would put a majority of Sikhs in India. (Amritsar had a non-Muslim majority and Gurdaspur a marginal Muslim majority.) To compensate for the exclusion of the Gurdaspur district, they included the entire Dinajpur district in the eastern zone of Pakistan, which similarly had a marginal Muslim majority. After receiving comments from John Thorne, member of the Executive Council in charge of Home affairs, Wavell forwarded the proposal to the Secretary of State. He justified the exclusion of the Amritsar district because of its sacredness to the Sikhs and that of Gurdaspur district because it had to go with Amritsar for &#x27;geographical reasons&#x27;. The Secretary of State commended the proposal and forwarded it to the India and Burma Committee, saying, &quot;I do not think that any better division than the one the Viceroy proposes is likely to be found&quot;.

===Sikh concerns===

The Sikh leader Master Tara Singh could see that any division of Punjab would leave the Sikhs divided between Pakistan and India. He espoused the doctrine of self-reliance, opposed the partition of India and called for independence on the grounds that no single religious community should control Punjab. Other Sikhs argued that just as Muslims feared Hindu domination the Sikhs also feared Muslim domination. Sikhs warned the British government that the morale of Sikh troops in the British Army would be affected if Pakistan was forced on them. Giani Kartar Singh drafted a scheme of a separate Sikh state if India was to be divided.

During the Partition developments, Jinnah offered Sikhs to live in Pakistan with safeguards for their rights. Sikhs refused because they opposed the concept of Pakistan and also because they did not want to become a small minority within a Muslim majority. Vir Singh Bhatti distributed pamphlets for the creation of a separate Sikh state &quot;Khalistan&quot;. Master Tara Singh wanted the right for an independent Khalistan to federate with either Hindustan or Pakistan. However, the Sikh state being proposed was for an area where neither religion was in absolute majority. Negotiations for the independent Sikh state had commenced at the end of World War II and the British initially agreed but the Sikhs withdrew this demand after pressure from Indian nationalists. The proposals of the Cabinet Mission Plan had seriously jolted the Sikhs because while both the Congress and League could be satisfied the Sikhs saw nothing in it for themselves. as they would be subjected to a Muslim majority. Master Tara Singh protested this to Pethic-Lawrence on 5 May. By early September the Sikh leaders accepted both the long term and interim proposals despite their earlier rejection. The Sikhs attached themselves to the Indian state with the promise of religious and cultural autonomy.

===Final negotiations===

In March 1946, the British government sent a Cabinet Mission to India to find a solution to resolve the conflicting demands of Congress and the Muslim League. Congress agreed to allow Pakistan to be formed with &#x27;genuine Muslim areas&#x27;. The Sikh leaders asked for a Sikh state with Ambala, Jalandher, Lahore Divisions with some districts from the Multan Division, which, however, did not meet the Cabinet delegates&#x27; agreement. In discussions with Jinnah, the Cabinet Mission offered either a &#x27;smaller Pakistan&#x27; with all the Muslim-majority districts &quot;except Gurdaspur&quot; or a &#x27;larger Pakistan&#x27; under the sovereignty of the Indian Union. The Cabinet Mission came close to success with its proposal for an Indian Union under a federal scheme, but it fell apart in the end because of Nehru&#x27;s opposition to a heavily decentralised India.

In March 1947, Lord Mountbatten arrived in India as the next viceroy, with an explicit mandate to achieve the transfer of power before June 1948. Over ten days, Mountbatten obtained the agreement of Congress to the Pakistan demand except for the 13 eastern districts of Punjab (including Amritsar and Gurdaspur). However, Jinnah held out. Through a series of six meetings with Mountbatten, he continued to maintain that his demand was for six full provinces. He &quot;bitterly complained&quot; that the Viceroy was ruining his Pakistan by cutting Punjab and Bengal in half as this would mean a &#x27;moth-eaten Pakistan&#x27;.

The Gurdaspur district remained a key contentious issue for the non-Muslims. Their members of the Punjab legislature made representations to Mountbatten&#x27;s chief of staff Lord Ismay as well as the Governor telling them that Gurdaspur was a &quot;non-Muslim district&quot;. They contended that even if it had a marginal Muslim majority of 51%, which they believed to be erroneous, the Muslims paid only 35% of the land revenue in the district.

In April, the Governor of Punjab Evan Jenkins wrote a note to Mountbatten proposing that Punjab be divided along Muslim and non-Muslim majority districts and proposed that a Boundary Commission be set up consisting of two Muslim and two non-Muslim members recommended by the Punjab Legislative Assembly. He also proposed that a British judge of the High Court be appointed as the chairman of the commission. Jinnah and the Muslim League continued to oppose the idea of partitioning the provinces, and the Sikhs were disturbed about the possibility of getting only 12 districts (without Gurdaspur). In this context, the Partition Plan of 3 June was announced with a notional partition showing 17 districts of Punjab in Pakistan and 12 districts in India, along with the establishment of a Boundary Commission to decide the final boundary. In Sialkoti&#x27;s view, this was done mainly to placate the Sikhs.

==Process and key people==
A crude border had already been drawn up by Lord Wavell, the Viceroy of India prior to his replacement as Viceroy, in February 1947, by Lord Louis Mountbatten. In order to determine exactly which territories to assign to each country, in June 1947, Britain appointed Sir Cyril Radcliffe to chair two boundary commissions‚Äîone for Bengal and one for Punjab.

The commission was instructed to &quot;demarcate the boundaries of the two parts of the Punjab on the basis of ascertaining the contiguous majority areas of Muslims and non-Muslims. In doing so, it will also take into account other factors.&quot; Other factors were undefined, giving Radcliffe leeway, but included decisions regarding &quot;natural boundaries, communications, watercourses and irrigation systems&quot;, as well as socio-political consideration. Each commission also had four representatives‚Äîtwo from the Indian National Congress and two from the Muslim League. Given the deadlock between the interests of the two sides and their rancorous relationship, the final decision was essentially Radcliffe&#x27;s.

After arriving in India on 8 July 1947, Radcliffe was given just five weeks to decide on a border. He soon met with his fellow college alumnus Mountbatten and travelled to Lahore and Calcutta to meet with commission members, chiefly Nehru from the Congress and Jinnah, president of the Muslim League. He objected to the short time frame, but all parties were insistent that the line be finished by the 15 August British withdrawal from India. Mountbatten had accepted the post as Viceroy on the condition of an early deadline. The decision was completed just a couple of days before the withdrawal, but due to political considerations, not published until 17 August 1947, two days after the grant of independence to India and Pakistan.

=== Members of the commissions ===

Each boundary commission consisted of five people ‚Äì a chairman (Radcliffe), two members nominated by the Indian National Congress and two members nominated by the Muslim League.

The Bengal Boundary Commission consisted of justices C. C. Biswas, B. K. Mukherji, Abu Saleh Mohamed Akram and S.A.Rahman.

The members of the Punjab Commission were justices Mehr Chand Mahajan, Teja Singh, Din Mohamed and Muhammad Munir.

==Problems in the process==

===Boundary-making procedures===

All lawyers by profession, Radcliffe and the other commissioners had all of the polish and none of the specialized knowledge needed for the task. They had no advisers to inform them of the well-established procedures and information needed to draw a boundary. Nor was there time to gather the survey and regional information. The absence of some experts and advisers, such as the United Nations, was deliberate, to avoid delay. Britain&#x27;s new Labour government &quot;deep in wartime debt, simply couldn&#x27;t afford to hold on to its increasingly unstable empire.&quot; &quot;The absence of outside participants‚Äîfor example, from the United Nations‚Äîalso satisfied the British Government&#x27;s urgent desire to save face by avoiding the appearance that it required outside help to govern‚Äîor stop governing‚Äîits own empire.&quot;

===Political representation===
The equal representation given to politicians from Indian National Congress and the Muslim League appeared to provide balance, but instead created deadlock. The relationships were so tendentious that the judges &quot;could hardly bear to speak to each other&quot;, and the agendas so at odds that there seemed to be little point anyway. Even worse, &quot;the wife and two children of the Sikh judge in Lahore had been murdered by Muslims in Rawalpindi a few weeks earlier.&quot;

In fact, minimizing the numbers of Hindus and Muslims on the wrong side of the line was not the only concern to balance. The Punjab Border Commission was to draw a border through the middle of an area home to the Sikh community. Lord Islay was rueful for the British not to give more consideration to the community who, in his words, had &quot;provided many thousands of splendid recruits for the Indian Army&quot; in its service for the crown in World War I. However, the Sikhs were militant in their opposition to any solution which would put their community in a Muslim ruled state. Moreover, many insisted on their own sovereign state, something no one else would agree to.

Last of all, were the communities without any representation. The Bengal Border Commission representatives were chiefly concerned with the question of who would get Calcutta. The Buddhist tribes in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bengal had no official representation and were left totally without information to prepare for their situation until two days after the partition.

Perceiving the situation as intractable and urgent, Radcliffe went on to make all the difficult decisions himself. This was impossible from inception, but Radcliffe seems to have had no doubt in himself and raised no official complaint or proposal to change the circumstances.

===Local knowledge===
Before his appointment, Radcliffe had never visited India and knew no one there. To the British and the feuding politicians alike, this neutrality was looked upon as an asset; he was considered to be unbiased toward any of the parties, except of course Britain. Only his private secretary, Christopher Beaumont, was familiar with the administration and life in Punjab. Wanting to preserve the appearance of impartiality, Radcliffe also kept his distance from Viceroy Mountbatten.

No amount of knowledge could produce a line that would completely avoid conflict; already, &quot;sectarian riots in Punjab and Bengal dimmed hopes for a quick and dignified British withdrawal&quot;. &quot;Many of the seeds of postcolonial disorder in South Asia were sown much earlier, in a century and half of direct and indirect British control of large part of the region, but, as book after book has demonstrated, nothing in the complex tragedy of partition was inevitable.&quot;

===Haste and indifference===
Radcliffe justified the casual division with the truism that no matter what he did, people would suffer. The thinking behind this justification may never be known since Radcliffe &quot;destroyed all his papers before he left India&quot;. He departed on Independence Day itself, before even the boundary awards were distributed. By his own admission, Radcliffe was heavily influenced by his lack of fitness for the Indian climate and his eagerness to depart India.

The implementation was no less hasty than the process of drawing the border. On 16 August 1947 at 5:00 pm, the Indian and Pakistani representatives were given two hours to study copies, before the Radcliffe award was published on 17 August.

===Secrecy===
To avoid disputes and delays, the division was done in secret. The final Awards were ready on 9 and 12 August, but not published until two days after the partition.

According to Read and Fisher, there is some circumstantial evidence that Nehru and Patel were secretly informed of the Punjab Award&#x27;s contents on 9 or 10 August, either through Mountbatten or Radcliffe&#x27;s Indian assistant secretary. Regardless of how it transpired, the award was changed to put a salient portion of the non-Muslim majority Firozpur district (consisting of the two Muslim-majority tehsils of Firozpur and Zira) east of the Sutlej canal within India&#x27;s domain instead of Pakistan&#x27;s. There were two apparent reasons for the switch: the area housed an army arms depot, and contained the headwaters of a canal which irrigated the princely state of Bikaner, which would accede to India.

===Implementation===
After the partition, the fledgling governments of India and Pakistan were left with all responsibility to implement the border. After visiting Lahore in August, Viceroy Mountbatten hastily arranged a Punjab Boundary Force to keep the peace around Lahore, but 50,000 men was not enough to prevent thousands of killings, 77% of which were in the rural areas. Given the size of the territory, the force amounted to less than one soldier per square mile. This was not enough to protect the cities much less the caravans of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who were fleeing their homes in what would become Pakistan.

Both India and Pakistan were loath to violate the agreement by supporting the rebellions of villages drawn on the wrong side of the border, as this could prompt a loss of face on the international stage and require the British or the UN to intervene. Border conflicts led to three wars, in 1947, 1965, and 1971, and the Kargil conflict of 1999.

==Disputes==
There were disputes regarding the Radcliffe Line&#x27;s award of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the Gurdaspur district. Disputes also evolved around the districts of Malda, Khulna, and Murshidabad in Bengal and the sub-division of Karimganj of Assam.

In addition to Gurdaspur&#x27;s Muslim majority tehsils, Radcliffe also gave the Muslim majority tehsils of Ajnala (Amritsar District), Zira, Firozpur (in Firozpur District), Nakodar and Jullandur (in Jullandur District) to India instead of Pakistan. On the other hand, Chittagong Hill Tracts and Khulna, with non-Muslim population of 97% and 51% respectively, were awarded to Pakistan.

===Punjab===
==== Firozpur District ====

Indian historians now accept that Mountbatten probably did influence the Firozpur award in India&#x27;s favour. The headworks of River Beas, which later joins River Sutlej flowing into Pakistan, were located in Firozpur. Congress leader Nehru and Viceroy Mountbatten had lobbied Radcliffe that headworks should not go to Pakistan.

==== Gurdaspur District ====
The Gurdaspur district was divided geographically by the Ravi River, with the Shakargarh tehsil on its west bank, and Pathankot, Gurdaspur and Batala tehsils on its east bank. The Shakargarh tehsil, the biggest in size, was awarded to Pakistan. (It was subsequently merged into the Narowal district of West Punjab.) The three eastern tehsils were awarded to India. (Pathankot was eventually made a separate district in East Punjab.) The division of the district was followed by a population transfer between the two nations, with Muslims leaving for Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs arriving from there.

The entire district of Gurdaspur had a bare majority of 50.2% Muslims. (In the `notional&#x27; award attached to the Indian Independence Act, all of Gurdaspur district was marked as Pakistan with a 51.14% Muslim majority. In the 1901 census, the population of Gurdaspur district was 49% Muslim, 40% Hindu, and 10% Sikh.) The Pathankot tehsil was predominantly Hindu while the other three tehsils were Muslim majority. In the event, only Shakargarh was awarded to Pakistan.

Radcliffe explained that the reason for deviating from the notional award in the case of Gurdaspur was that the headwaters of the canals that irrigated the Amritsar district lay in the Gurdaspur district and it was important to keep them under one administration. Radcliffe might have sided with Lord Wavell&#x27;s reasoning from February 1946 that Gurdaspur had to go with the Amritsar district, and the latter could not be in Pakistan due to its Sikh religious shrines. In addition, the railway line from Amritsar to Pathankot passed through the Batala and Gurdaspur tehsils. He further claimed that to compensate for the exclusion of the Gurdaspur district, they included the entire Dinajpur district in the eastern zone of Pakistan, which similarly had a marginal Muslim majority.

Pakistanis have alleged that the award of the three tehsils to India was a manipulation of the Award by Lord Mountbatten in an effort to provide a land route for India to Jammu and Kashmir. However, Shereen Ilahi points out that the land route to Kashmir was entirely within the Hindu-majority Pathankot tehsil. The award of the Batala and Gurdaspur tehsils to India did not affect the Kashmir land route.

====Pakistani view on the award of Gurdaspur to India====

Pakistan maintains that the Radcliffe Award was altered by Mountbatten; Gurdaspur was handed over to India and thus was manipulated the accession of Kashmir to India. In support of this view, some scholars claim the award to India &quot;had little to do with Sikh demands but had much more to do with providing India a road link to Jammu and Kashmir.&quot;

As per the &#x27;notional&#x27; award that had already been put into effect for purposes of administration ad interim, all of Gurdaspur district, owing to its Muslim majority, was assigned to Pakistan. From 14 to 17 August, Mushtaq Ahmed Cheema acted as the Deputy Commissioner of the Gurdaspur District, but when, after a delay of two days, it was announced that the major portion of the district had been awarded to India instead of Pakistan, Cheema left for Pakistan. The major part of Gurdaspur district, i.e. three of the four sub-districts had been handed over to India giving India practical land access to Kashmir. It came as a great blow to Pakistan. Jinnah and other leaders of Pakistan, and particularly its officials, criticized the award as &#x27;extremely unjust and unfair&#x27;.

Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, who represented the Muslim League in July 1947 before the Radcliffe Boundary Commission, stated that the boundary commission was a farce. A secret deal between Mountbatten and Congress leaders had already been struck. Mehr Chand Mahajan, one of the two non-Muslim members of the boundary commission, in his autobiography, has acknowledged that when he was selected for the boundary commission, he was not inclined to accept the invitation as he believed that the commission was just a farce and that decisions were actually to be taken by Mountbatten himself. It was only under British pressure that the charges against Mountbatten of last minute alterations in the Radcliffe Award were not officially brought forward by Pakistani Government in the UN Security Council while presenting its case on Kashmir.

Zafrullah Khan states that, in fact, adopting the tehsil as a unit would have given Pakistan the Firozepur and Zira tehsils of the Firozpur District, the Jullundur and Nakodar tehsils of Jullundur district and the Dasuya tehsil of the Hoshiarpur district. The line so drawn would also give Pakistan the princely state of Kapurthala (which had a Muslim majority) and would enclose within Pakistan the whole of the Amritsar district of which only one tehsil, Ajnala, had a Muslim majority. It would also give Pakistan the Shakargarh, Batala and Gurdaspur tehsils of the Gurdaspur district. If the boundary went by Doabs, Pakistan could get not only the 16 districts which had already under the notional partition been put into West Punjab, including the Gurdaspur District, but also get the Kangra District in the mountains, which was about 93% Hindu and was located to the north and east of Gurdaspur. Or one could go by commissioners&#x27; divisions. Any of these units being adopted would have been more favourable to Pakistan than the present boundary line. The tehsil was the most favourable unit. But all of the aforementioned Muslim majority tehsils, with the exception of Shakargarh, were handed over to India while Pakistan didn&#x27;t receive any Non-Muslim majority district or tehsil in Punjab. Zafruallh Khan states that Radcliffe used district, tehsil, thana, and even village boundaries to divide Punjab in such a way that the boundary line was drawn much to the prejudice of Pakistan. However, while Muslims formed about 53% of the total population of Punjab in 1941, Pakistan received around 58% of the total area of the Punjab, including more of the most fertile parts.

According to Zafrullah Khan, the assertion that the award of the Batala and Gurdaspur tehsils to India did not &#x27;affect&#x27; Kashmir is far-fetched. If Batala and Gurdaspur had gone to Pakistan, Pathankot tehsil would have been isolated and blocked. Even though it would have been possible for India to get access to Pathankot through the Hoshiarpur district, it would have taken quite long time to construct the roads, bridges and communications that would have been necessary for military movements.

====Assessments on the &#x27;Controversial Award of Gurdaspur to India and the Kashmir Dispute&#x27;====
Stanley Wolpert writes that Radcliffe in his initial maps awarded Gurdaspur district to Pakistan but one of Nehru&#x27;s and Mountbatten&#x27;s greatest concerns over the new Punjab border was to make sure that Gurdaspur would not go to Pakistan, since that would have deprived India of direct road access to Kashmir. As per &quot;The Different Aspects of Islamic Culture&quot;, a part of UNESCO&#x27;s Histories flagship project, recently disclosed documents of the history of the partition reveal British complicity with the top Indian leadership to wrest Kashmir from Pakistan. Alastair Lamb, based on the study of recently declassified documents, has convincingly proven that Mountbatten, in league with Nehru, was instrumental in pressurizing Radcliffe to award the Muslim-majority district of Gurdaspur in East Punjab to India which could provide India with the only possible access to Kashmir. Andrew Roberts believes that Mountbatten cheated over India-Pak frontier and states that if gerrymandering took place in the case of Firozepur, it is not too hard to believe that Mountbatten also pressurized Radcliffe to ensure that Gurdaspur wound up in India to give India road access to Kashmir.

Perry Anderson states that Mountbatten, who was officially supposed to neither exercise any influence on Radcliffe nor to have any knowledge of his findings, intervened behind the scenes ‚Äì probably at Nehru&#x27;s behest ‚Äì to alter the award. He had little difficulty in getting Radcliffe to change his boundaries to allot the Muslim-majority district of Gurdaspur to India instead of Pakistan, thus giving India the only road access from Delhi to Kashmir.

However, some British works suggest that the &#x27;Kashmir State was not in anybody&#x27;s mind&#x27; when the Award was being drawn and that even the Pakistanis themselves had not realized the importance of Gurdaspur to Kashmir until the Indian forces actually entered Kashmir. Both Mountbatten and Radcliffe, of course, have strongly denied those charges. It is impossible to accurately quantify the personal responsibility for the tragedy of Kashmir as the Mountbatten papers relating to the issue at the India Office Library and records are closed to scholars for an indefinite period.

===Bengal===
====Chittagong Hill Tracts====

The Chittagong Hill Tracts had a majority non-Muslim population of 97% (most of them Buddhists), but was given to Pakistan. The Chittagong Hill Tracts People&#x27;s Association (CHTPA) petitioned the Bengal Boundary Commission that, since the CHTs were inhabited largely by non-Muslims, they should remain within India. The Chittagong Hill Tracts was an excluded area since 1900 and was not part of Bengal. It had no representative at the Bengal Legislative Assembly in Calcutta, since it was not part of Bengal. Since they had no official representation, there was no official discussion on the matter, and many on the Indian side assumed the CHT would be awarded to India.
On 15 August 1947, Chakma and other indigenous Buddhists celebrated independence day by hoisting Indian flag in Rangamati, the capital of Chittagong Hill Tracts. When the boundaries of Pakistan and India were announced by radio on 17 August 1947, they were shocked to know that the Chittagong Hill Tracts had been awarded to Pakistan. The Baluch Regiment of the Pakistani Army entered Chittagong Hill Tracts a week later and lowered the Indian flag at gun point. The rationale of giving the Chittagong Hill Tracts to Pakistan was that they were inaccessible to India and to provide a substantial rural buffer to support Chittagong (now in Bangladesh), a major city and port; advocates for Pakistan forcefully argued to the Bengal Boundary Commission that the only approach was through Chittagong.

The indigenous people sent a delegation led by Sneha Kumar Chakma to Delhi to seek help from the Indian leadership. Sneha Kumar Chakma contacted Sardar Patel by phone. Sardar Patel was willing to help, but insisted Sneha Kumar Chakma seek assistance from Prime Minister Pandit Nehru. But Nehru refused to help fearing that military conflict for Chittagong Hill Tracts might draw the British back to India.

==== Malda District ====
Another disputed decision made by Radcliffe was the division of the Malda district of Bengal. The district overall had a slight Muslim majority, but was divided and most of it, including Malda town, went to India. The district remained under East Pakistan administration for 3‚Äì4 days after 15 August 1947. It was only when the award was made public that the Pakistani flag was replaced by the Indian flag in Malda.

====Khulna and Murshidabad Districts====
The Khulna District (with a marginal Hindu majority of 51%) was given to East Pakistan in lieu of the Murshidabad district (with a 70% Muslim majority), which went to India. However, the Pakistani flag remained hoisted in Murshidabad for three days until it was replaced by the Indian flag on the afternoon of 17 August 1947.

==== Karimganj ====

The Sylhet district of Assam joined Pakistan in accordance with a referendum. However, the Karimganj sub-division (with a Muslim majority) was separated from Sylhet and given to India, where it became a district in 1983. As of the 2001 Indian census, Karimganj district now has a Muslim majority of 52.3%.

===Legacy and historiography===

As a part of a series on borders, the explanatory news site Vox featured an episode looking at &quot;the ways that the Radcliffe line changed Punjab, and its everlasting effects&quot; including disrupting &quot;a centuries-old Sikh pilgrimage&quot; and separating &quot;Punjabi people of all faiths from each other.&quot;

===Artistic depictions===

One notable depiction is &quot;Drawing the Line&quot;, written by British playwright Howard Brenton. On his motivation for writing the play, Brenton said he first became interested in the story of the Radcliffe Line while holidaying in India and hearing stories from people whose families had fled across the new line.
Defending his portrayal of Cyril Radcliffe as a man who struggled with his conscience, Brenton said, &quot;There were clues that Radcliffe had a dark night of the soul in the bungalow: he refused to accept his fee, he did collect all the papers and draft maps, took them home to England and burnt them. And he refused to say a word, even to his family, about what happened. My playwright&#x27;s brain went into overdrive when I discovered these details.&quot;

Indian filmmaker Ram Madhvani created a nine-minute short film where he explored the plausible scenario of Radcliffe regretting the line he drew. The film was inspired by W. H. Auden&#x27;s poem on the Partition.

Visual artists Zarina Hashmi, Salima Hashmi, Nalini Malini, Reena Saini Kallat and Pritika Chowdhry have created drawings, prints and sculptures depicting the Radcliffe Line.

<text>Stephen J. Sansweet (born June 14, 1945) is the chairman and former president of Rancho Obi-Wan, a nonprofit museum that houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of &quot;Star Wars&quot; memorabilia.

Prior to his retirement in April 2011, he was Director of Content Management and head of Fan Relations at Lucasfilm Ltd. for 15 years, and remains Fan Relations Advisor for the company. He is author or co-author of eighteen books, sixteen of them about &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

After Sansweet relocated to Northern California to be closer to his new office at Skywalker Ranch, he bought a former chicken ranch and refurbished its barns to house his collection. The property was renamed Rancho Obi-Wan. In September 2013, his collection of an estimated 300,000 items was recognized by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as being the largest of its kind in the world.

== Biography ==
Sansweet was born in 1945 and raised in the Wynnefield section of Philadelphia. He says he knew he wanted to be a writer from age six, when he hand-printed a newsletter and sold copies to neighbors for three cents. School newspapers, magazines, and yearbooks followed, and he became a journalism major at Temple University.

Sansweet says that he got a lot out of his classes, many taught by working journalists. But he got as much out of a unique community of fellow students who put out the four-times-a-week &quot;Temple News&quot;. There was no better training, from reporting and writing to photography and editing ‚Äî and even &quot;paste-up&quot; in the composing room to get the offset daily ready for the printer, he adds. He worked on the special issue reporting the assassination of John F. Kennedy; as two-term editor-in-chief a few years later, he called in late-night instructions to hand-print a banner headline announcing a next-day visit to the campus of President Lyndon Johnson.

Between his junior and senior years, Sansweet got a then-rare summer internship at &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, where he worked the night police beat; he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and was named an Outstanding Journalism Graduate at Temple. In 2009, he was inducted into Temple&#x27;s Media Hall of Excellence. Immediately after graduating, he went to work full-time for the &quot;Inquirer&quot;. During this time, Sansweet served a six-year stint in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, transferring to the Air National Guard.

In early 1969, Sansweet became a reporter for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. After working in the paper&#x27;s Philadelphia and Montreal bureaus, Sansweet was transferred to Los Angeles, where he covered the gaming industry, aerospace, banking, and Hollywood. He helped break the first stories on massive foreign bribery by U.S.-based multinationals and was part of a journalism team that won the 1977 Sigma Delta Chi Public Service Award; he was a Loeb Award finalist in 1990.

Sansweet was a lecturer in business journalism at the University of Southern California in the mid-1980s, teaching a course that he created. He became the &quot;Wall Street Journal&#x27;s&quot; Los Angeles bureau chief in 1987, a position he kept until 1996 when he made a leap of faith and &quot;followed his bliss&quot; ‚Äî and passion ‚Äì to become Director of Specialty Marketing at Lucasfilm Ltd. His title later changed to Director of Content Management and Head of Fan Relations.

Sansweet turned his love of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga into a second career, acting as Lucasfilm&#x27;s liaison to fans worldwide, and their liaison to the company. He did presentations at well over 100 conventions in the U.S. and many more internationally from the U.K., France, Spain, and Germany, to Australia, Japan, Mexico, and Finland. He appeared on more than 50 hours of &quot;Star Wars&quot; collectibles programming on QVC in the last half of the 1990s, and has amassed the world&#x27;s largest private collection of &quot;Star Wars&quot; memorabilia, housed in a converted chicken barn in Sonoma County, Calif. Not abandoning his love of writing, Sansweet has eighteen books to his credit, sixteen of them on &quot;Star Wars&quot;, including the 1.2 million word &quot;Complete Star Wars Encyclopedia&quot; in 2008 and 2012&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: The Ultimate Action Figure Collection&quot;.

It was announced on October 20, 2010, that Sansweet would be stepping down as head of fan relations effective April 2011. He stated via press release: &quot;Nearly 15 years ago I left my post as Los Angeles Bureau Chief of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; to follow my bliss and take a &#x27;one-year job&#x27; as Lucasfilm&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; ambassador,&quot; said Sansweet. &quot;Now it&#x27;s time for another change and new challenges, while still maintaining an active role in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan community.&quot;

In June 2017 Sansweet said that he was a victim of theft and that over 100 items from his collection have been stolen, &quot;The majority of them vintage U.S. and foreign carded action figures, many of them rare and important pieces.&quot; Reportedly, several of those pieces have already been, &quot;Resold or professionally appraised for a total of more than $200,000.&quot; According to Sansweet, a man named Carl Edward Cunningham, whom Sansweet refers to as, &quot;A good and trusted friend,&quot; surrendered to police at the end of March 2017, but is currently out on bail pending additional hearings.

<doc id="1230081" wikidata="Q12060940" url="?curid=1230081" title="Kallil Temple">
<text>Kallil Temple is a hindu -Jain temple located at Kerala, South India. It is 8¬†km away from Perumbavoor in Ernakulam district of Kerala. Kallil in Malayalam means &#x27;in stone&#x27;. It is one of the most ancient hindu temple in Kerala. It is one of the protected monuments in Kerala under Kerala State Department of Archaeology.

== Overview ==
The temple, located in a 28-acre (113,000 m2) plot, is cut from a huge rock, and a climb of 69 steps leads to the temple. 

To reach the temple one has to travel a distance of about 2¬†km from Odakkali, on the Aluva Munnar Road and 10¬†km from Perumbavoor. 

The temple is owned by the Kallil Pisharody family. The present Karanavar of the family turned over all the administrative control of the temple and all its belongings to &#x27;Chenkottukonam Sree Ramadasashramam&#x27;. But all that retrieved back due to some hassle between local people and Ashram authorities.

Location

The temple is located at Methala near Perumbavoor in Ernakulam district.¬† The temple is located at a distance of 10 km from Perumbavoor.¬† It is located at a distance of 4 km from Odakali between Perumbavoor and Kothamangalam.

Kallil Bhagavathi Temple

There are many temples where history and legend converge.¬† The temples that still stand tall today with unbelievable stories and myths that overcome it.¬† The Kallil Bhagwati Temple is one such temple.¬† The story of the Kallil Bhagwati Temple is located in the village of Methala near Perumbavoor in Ernakulam district.¬† To the highlights of the &quot;Kallil Bhagavathi Temple,&quot; which is believed to be over five thousand years old and has become a part of the history of Kerala itself !!!
Perumbavoor is famous for its stone Bhagavathi Temple, which can be reached by crossing over a hundred steps in the jungle.¬† The temple is said to be over five thousand years old and is marked by Perumbavoor on the temple map.¬† It is now preserved as a protected monument under the Archaeological Department.

Legend

If you search for the history of the Kallil Temple, you will come across Jainism.¬† It is believed that this was a Jain temple in the early days.¬† It is believed that Padmavati, the Yakshiya of Jainism, is worshiped here as Bhagwati.¬† It is believed that the Jain temple later became the Bhagwati temple.¬† It is believed that this change took place in the ninth century. The legend spread here is related to a woman.¬† Once upon a time, people came to the forest and saw a woman of extraordinary beauty.¬† They disappeared when he went to see them playing with stones.¬† They hide in the cave with the stones they were playing with.¬† It is believed that the goddess was Bhagwati.¬† It is believed that the stone that went up while the goddess was playing became the roof of the temple and came down as a seat.The stones that were worshiped by the Goddess are still here today ... The huge rock that stands on the roof of the shrine does not touch the ground.¬† This rock that stands tall in the air does not move even if 15 elephants pull it together!

The two most important vows here are the stone vow and the broom vow.¬† The broom vows are made for women to grow hair and for men to change family troubles.¬† The broom vow is made of wool without touching the iron and offered to the temple.

The stone vows to complete the housework that was stopped half way.¬† If you bring two or three stones from the house where the work is being done and bring them to the temple for prayers, the work will be completed within a year.¬† People who can do whatever they want come here and give thanks again and make vows and pray.

Cave Temple

This temple is also known as the Kallil Cave Temple.¬† The Goddess is enshrined in a cave made of stone.¬† As it is a cave temple, it is not possible to walk around behind the shrine like in normal temples.¬† Therefore, when circling Bhagwati, the circumambulation is completed by bowing to the stone.There is ample evidence that this was a Jain temple in the early days.¬† The idols of Parshvanath and Mahavira in Jainism have become idols of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu.

Pooja time

The festival is celebrated on the Karthika day in the month of Scorpio.¬† The festival lasts for eight days.

Until a few days ago, it was customary to walk after noon pooja.

This was due to the difficulty of returning so far for evening poojas.¬† But now even though the walk is closed for noon pooja, the walk is reopened for evening devotional and Athazha pooja.

== Main deity ==

Rock-carved images of the 23rd Tirthankara, Parshvanatha, &quot;Vardhaman Mahavira&quot; (24th &quot;Tirthankara&quot;) and Padmavati devi are present in the temple. &quot;Padmavati devi&quot; is worshipped as &quot;Bhagawathi&quot; by the local population. The major festival of the temple is celebrated from Karthika of month Vrishchika and usually lasts for a week.

<doc id="1230089" wikidata="Q130885" url="?curid=1230089" title="Euoplocephalus">
<text>Euoplocephalus ( ) is a genus of large herbivorous ankylosaurid dinosaurs, living during the Late Cretaceous of Canada. It has only one named species, Euoplocephalus tutus.

The first fossil of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; was found in 1897 in Alberta. In 1902, it was named &quot;Stereocephalus&quot;, but that name had already been given to an insect, so it was changed in 1910. Later, many more ankylosaurid remains were found from the Campanian of North America and often made separate genera. In 1971, Walter Coombs concluded that they all belonged to &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, which then make it one of the best-known dinosaurs. Recently, however, experts have come to the opposite conclusion, limiting the authentic finds of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; to about a dozen specimens. These include a number of almost complete skeletons, so nevertheless much is known about the build of the animal.

&quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; reached in length and in body mass. Its body was low-slung and very flat and wide, standing on four sturdy legs. Its head had a short drooping snout with a horny beak to bite off plants that were digested in the large gut. Like other ankylosaurids, &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; was largely covered by bony armor plates, among them rows of large high-ridged oval scutes. The neck was protected by two bone rings. It could also actively defend itself against predators like &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, &quot;Daspletosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot; using a heavy club at the end of its tail.

==Description==

===Size===

Among the ankylosaurids, &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; was exceeded in size only by &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, and perhaps &quot;Tarchia&quot; and &quot;Cedarpelta&quot;. &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; was about long and weighed about . Like other ankylosaurids, it had a very broad and flat low-slung torso, about four feet high, positioned on four short legs.

===Distinguishing traits===
The skull of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; can be distinguished from most other ankylosaurids by several anatomical details, including: the pattern of bony sculpturing in the region in front of the eyes; the form of the palpebral bones (small bones over the eyes), which may have served as bony eyelids; the shallowness of the nasal vestibule at the entrance of the nasal cavity; the medial curve of the tooth rows in the upper jaw; and the teeth, which are relatively small, lacking true cingula, and having variable fluting of the denticles. However, these traits are shared with a number of closely related forms, some of which in the past have been included in the genus. Combining such forms, Walter Coombs and Teresa Marya≈Ñska in 1990 stated that &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; could be distinguished based on four traits. The premaxillae, the front snout bones, are not covered by dermal ossifications. The external bony nostrils are slit-like, face to the front and are each divided by a vertical bone sheet or septum. The beak has a width equal to or greater than the distance between the rear maxillary, upper cheek, teeth rows. The foot has three digits, metatarsals with toes.

In 2013, Victoria Arbour and Phil Currie provided a differential diagnosis, setting &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; apart from its nearest relatives. When compared with &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Scolosaurus&quot;, &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; lacks round osteoderms at the base of the squamosal and quadratojugal horns. Compared with &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; it lacks small osteoderms at the bases of the large osteoderms on the first cervical half-ring, but, contrary to that genus, does in top view have large rounded osteoderms at the sides of the tail club. It differs from &quot;Dyoplosaurus&quot; in possessing sacral ribs that perpendicularly point outwards. It differs from &quot;Scolosaurus&quot; in possessing keeled osteoderms with a round or oval base on the top and sides of the first cervical half-ring and having a shorter rear blade of the ilium. &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; differs from &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; in possessing anteriorly directed external nostrils and in lacking a continuous keel between the squamosal horn and the supraorbitals.

===Skeleton===
The skull of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; resembles a truncated equilateral triangle when viewed from above, and is slightly wider than it is long. The largest known skull, that of specimen AMNH 5403, has a length of 411 millimetres and a width of 478 millimetres. Most skull elements are completely fused and two skull openings normally present with dinosaurs, the antorbital fenestra and the upper temporal fenestra, have closed. The skull has nineteen to twenty-four teeth in each upper jaw. The frontmost snout bone, the premaxilla, is toothless. The teeth are very small, with a maximal height and width of just 7.5 millimetres. The strongly drooping snout is blunt, wide and high, and filled with very complex air passages and sinuses, the form and function of which are not yet completely understood. Each side has two external nostrils. The lower jaw has a very concave upper rim with twenty-one teeth. At its front a short low extension is present, to provide contact with the wide predentary, the bony core of the lower horny beak, that fitted within the upper beak of the snout.

As in most quadrupedal ornithischians, its neck is moderately short. The scapula is massive and robust, and the very robust forelimbs are shorter than the hindlimbs. The tail is long and ends in a bony club. Old restorations of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; and rejected synonyms (&quot;Dyoplosaurus&quot;, &quot;Scolosaurus&quot;) often show a club with two large vertical spikes. This is an error based on a restoration of &quot;Scolosaurus&quot; by Franz Nopcsa; the specimen he used had an incomplete tail that stopped just beyond the pair of conical spikes now known to have been positioned halfway along its length. He restored the tail as ending just after the spines. Other artists combined the spikes with the tail club, compounding the inaccuracy. The narrow distal half of the tail is stiffened by bundles of ossified tendons.

The vertebral column of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; is made up of at least seven cervical vertebrae, at least eleven &quot;free&quot; dorsal vertebrae, typically four sacrodorsals forming a fused &quot;sacral rod&quot; in front of the sacrum proper, three &quot;true&quot; sacral vertebrae, and between one and four caudosacrals. Like with other ankylosaurians, the last four dorsal vertebrae and the first caudal vertebra are thus fused to the sacrum, forming a reinforced synsacrum of at least eight vertebrae, the spines of which form a fused supraneural plate, also incorporating the zygapophyses. There are at least twenty-one caudal vertebrae; the total number of caudal vertebrae is uncertain because approximately ten are fused to form part of the tail club, bringing the total to about thirty. This fusion is also seen in other ankylosaurids; it is possible that the extent of fusion is an age-related feature.

The humerus is very robust with strongly expanded upper and lower joints, combined with a narrow shaft. On the upper shaft an enormous deltopectoral crest is present of which the lower part does not gradually merge with the shaft but is warped to the front, forming a thick knob or lip. All this indicates a very heavy musculature. In the lower arm the robust ulna has a well-developed olecranon process. The wrist and hand bones are not well known. In the pelvis, the front blade of the ilium splayed out to the front, reaching all the way to the widest point of the belly to support the gut. This blade also forms a bone shelf at the rear side of the body. The rear blade of the ilium is shorter than the diameter of the hip socket it was located behind, meaning the leg is located at the rear end of the pelvis, near the tail base and much closer to the midline than the belly sides. The pubic bone is unknown. The ischium is a short, curved, vertically positioned bone strap. The thighbone is short, robust and straight with a low fourth trochanter positioned below the midpoint of the shaft. The robust shinbone is shorter than the thighbone. The foot is not well known but functionally tridactyl with hoof-shaped instead of sharp claws.

===Armor===
The head and body of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; were covered with bony armor, except for parts of the limbs and possibly the distal tail. The armor consisted of osteoderms, skin ossifications that are not part of the skeleton proper. This armor was in 1982 extensively described by Kenneth Carpenter, who however, largely based himself on the very complete specimen NHMUK R5161, the holotype of &quot;Scolosaurus&quot;, which genus no longer is seen as a synonym of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. When limited to the certain material of the latter genus, little is known of the exact configuration of the armor, with the exception of the head and the neck. The most informative specimen in this respect would then be ROM 1930, having conserved some osteoderms of the torso in their original position.

In any case, much of the armor was made up of small ossicles, bony round scutes with a diameter of less than five millimetres, of which often hundreds have been found with a single specimen. If the armor was configured in an identical way to that of &quot;Scolosaurus&quot;, many of these small ossicles had fused into a kind of pavement, forming transverse bands on the body. The banded arrangement is thought to have permitted some freedom of movement. Four of these bands might have been present on the anterior half of the tail, three on the pelvis, perhaps fused into a single &quot;sacral shield&quot;, and four across the front part of the torso. Inset in these bands were horizontal rows of larger oval, flat or keeled, scutes. Types of large scutes varied by body region. It might be that the scutes on the shoulder, near the midline of the body, were largest and tallest; ROM 1930 includes some osteoderms with a base length of fifteen centimeters. Little is known about the armor of the limbs. Large keeled plates were present on the upper arms as shown by specimen TMP 1997.132.01 conserving a round osteoderm near the humerus with a diameter of twenty centimeters and narrower spikes associated with the lower arm. The neck was protected by two bone rings, open at the underside, that are called &quot;cervical half-rings&quot;. Earlier seen as a fusion of osteoderms, this was doubted by Arbour et al. in 2013, who pointed out that they formed a lower layer, possibly consisting of ossified cartilage, as indicated by a smooth surface and a woven bone texture. Each half-ring is constructed out of six rectangular concave plates, three per side. Each plate has a large keeled osteoderm on top, often not fused with it. With &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, these neck osteoderms do not have smaller osteoderms at their bases, and their keels do not overhang their posterior edges.

The armor of the skull consists of a large number of ossicles, called &quot;caputegulae&quot; (&quot;head tiles&quot;), that have fused with the normal skull elements, largely fading their sutures. On the snout they form a chaotic and asymmetric mosaic. On the rear nasal region, at the midline a single hexagonal larger plate is present. A keeled plate per side, somewhat more to the back forms the snout rim. Behind the level of the eye sockets the &quot;caputegulae&quot; fuse into a single bone surface. The upper rim of the eye sockets is formed by two pyramid-shaped osteoderms pointing to the sides and rear. In addition, &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; had two pyramid-shaped squamosal &quot;horns&quot; growing from the back corners of its head. Between them the nuchal crest is covered by two osteoderms per side. At the lower rear side of the skull, a quadratojugal horn is present, in the form of an enormous tongue-shaped osteoderm projecting below.

==Discovery and species==

Canadian paleontologist Lawrence Morris Lambe discovered the first specimen on 18 August 1897 in the area of the present Dinosaur Provincial Park, in the valley of the Red Deer River, Alberta, Canada. In 1902, this fossil, CMN 210 (also NMC 210) was designated as the holotype specimen of the type species &quot;Stereocephalus tutus&quot;. This specimen consists of the upper part of a cranium and a transverse series of five scutes that were part of a cervical half ring. The generic name was derived from Greek œÉœÑŒµœÅŒµœåœÇ, &quot;stereos&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, and Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ, &quot;kephal√®&quot;, &quot;head&quot;, which refers to the formidable armour. However, the genus name was already preoccupied ‚Äî the name had already been given to an insect, the beetle &quot;Stereocephalus&quot; Lynch 1884 ‚Äî so Lambe changed it to &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; in 1910, with as &quot;combinatio nova&quot; (new combination name) &quot;Euoplocephalus tutus&quot;. The type species remains &quot;Stereocephalus tutus&quot;. In 1915, Edwin Hennig classified &quot;E. tutus&quot; under the genus &quot;Palaeoscincus&quot; Leidy 1856, coining &quot;Palaeoscincus tutus&quot;. Today however, &quot;Palaeoscincus&quot; is considered to be a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; based on indeterminate ankylosaurian teeth. In 1964, &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; was by Oskar Kuhn referred to &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;, as a &quot;Ankylosaurus tutus&quot;.

The genus name &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, meaning &quot;well-armed head&quot;, is derived from the Greek words &quot;eu&quot; (Œµ·Ωñ) meaning &quot;well&quot;, &quot;hoplo&quot;~ (·ΩÅœÄŒªŒø~) meaning &quot;armed&quot;, and &quot;kephale&quot; (Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ) meaning &quot;head&quot;. This name has been misspelled more than a dozen different ways in formal scientific literature. The specific name &quot;tutus&quot; means &quot;safely protected&quot; in Latin. The only valid species known today is &quot;Euoplocephalus tutus&quot;.

===Referred material===
During the early twentieth century many more ankylosaurid fossils were uncovered in North America. Some were referred to &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, others named as separate genera. In 1971 however, Walter Coombs submitted a dissertation containing a landmark re-appraisal of North American ankylosaurs. He noted that, among the many specimens similar to &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, their skulls varied so much that either every known specimen must be a new species, or they all represented individual variation within a single species: &quot;Euoplocephalus tutus&quot;. Starting from this assumption that there was only one species of ankylosaur during the Campanian stage of the Upper Cretaceous, Coombs synonymized the genera &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dyoplosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Scolosaurus&quot; with &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; and the species &quot;A. lambei&quot;, &quot;D. acutosquameus&quot;, and &quot;S. cutleri&quot; with &quot;E. tutus&quot;, creating a species that spanned nearly ten million years, or the entire Campanian. The fossils now referred to this species contained more than forty individuals discovered in Alberta, Canada and Montana in the United States, which would have made &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; the best known ankylosaurid. This included fifteen skulls, teeth, and a few almost-complete skeletons, found with the armor still attached. Individual armor plates are the most commonly found element from them. In 1978, Coombs even included the Asian ankylosaurid &quot;Tarchia&quot; in the genus, renaming it as &quot;Euoplocephalus giganteus&quot;.

The synonymy of all Campanian North-American ankylosaurids was followed for several decades, until scientists from the University of Alberta began to re-examine the fossils. A 2009 study found that &quot;Dyoplosaurus&quot; is in fact a valid taxon, and identified unique characteristics that differentiated it from &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, including its triangular claws. Victoria Arbour (2010) argued that &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; (known from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation) is distinct from &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; and is also a valid taxon; according to Arbour, &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; differs from &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; in distinctive skull and cervical half ring ornamentation, as well as tail club morphology, including the presence of pointed, triangular knob osteoderms in &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot;. Furthermore, Arbour (2010) suggested to reassign all Horseshoe Canyon Formation ankylosaurine specimens from &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; to &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot;. The validity of &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; was accepted in two subsequent studies. The first, published by Paul Penkalski and William T. Blows in 2013, re-validated &quot;Scolosaurus&quot; as well. The second study, by Penkalski (2013), named and described &quot;Oohkotokia&quot; from Montana on the basis of remains that were originally thought to be referable to &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;.

&quot;Palaeoscincus asper&quot;, &quot;the rough one&quot;, is now considered to be &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. It is a dubious tooth taxon from the late Campanian Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, named by Lambe in 1902. It consists of a single tooth, specimen NMC 1349.

In 2013 Arbour limited the specimens that could be reliably referred to &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; to the lowest thirty metres of the Dinosaur Park Formation. The material would in that case, apart from the holotype, consist of partial skeletons with skull AMNH 5337, AMNH 5403, AMNH 5404, AMNH 5405, ROM 1930 and UALVP 31; partial skeleton lacking the skull AMNH 5406; CMN 842, a cervical half-ring; CMN 8876, a skull, TMP 1979.14.74, a fragmentary skull; and UALVP 47977, a skull roof piece. The hands, feet and tail, including the club, are therefore not completely known. However, many of those specimens have now been reassigned to other, new taxa, including &quot;Scolosaurus&quot; and &quot;Platypelta&quot;, and others.

==Classification==
In 1910, Lambe assigned &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; to the Stegosauria, a group then encompassing all armoured dinosaur forms and thus having a much wider range than the present concept. In 1917, Charles Whitney Gilmore assigned it to the Ankylosauridae. Today, &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; is still seen as an ankylosaurid, but as a member of the Ankylosauria, not the Stegosauria. It is likely also a member of the derived subgroup Ankylosaurinae. The recent splitting of the ankylosaurid Campanian material of North America has complicated the issue of the direct affinities of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;. Penkalski (2013) performed a small phylogenetic analysis of some ankylosaurine specimens. The only &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; specimen that was included in this analysis was its holotype. &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot; was placed in a polytomy with the holotype of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; and some specimens that are referred to it, while &quot;Oohkotokia&quot; was placed in a clade with &quot;Dyoplosaurus&quot;, and specimens that are thought to represent either &quot;Dyoplosaurus&quot; or &quot;Scolosaurus&quot;.

The following cladogram is based on a 2015 phylogenetic analysis of the Ankylosaurinae conducted by Arbour and Currie:

The results of an earlier analysis of the ankylosaurid tree by Thompson et al. (2011), is shown by this cladogram.

==Paleoecology==
&quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, following the synonymizations proposed by Coombs (1971), was thought to exist for far longer, and was a member of more distinct faunas, than any of its contemporaries, as these fossils dated to between 76.5 and 67¬†million years ago in the Campanian-Maastrichtian ages of the late Cretaceous period, and came from the Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon Formations of Alberta, Two Medicine Formation of Montana, and possibly from the Oldman Formation of Alberta. Fossils that were initially believed to be from the Judith River Formation of Montana are actually from the Dinosaur Park Formation. However, recent studies referred all Horseshoe Canyon Formation specimens to &quot;Anodontosaurus&quot;, and all Two Medicine Formation specimens to &quot;Oohkotokia&quot;. A specimen from the lowermost Dinosaur Park, or possibly from the underlying Oldman Formation, was reassigned back to &quot;Scolosaurus&quot;. Although the stratigraphic range of the holotype of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; is uncertain, all specimens that can be reliably referred to &quot;E. tutus&quot; came from the lower 40 m and the upper &gt;10 m of the Dinosaur Park Formation. There are no known ankylosaurids from the top 20‚Äì25 m of the Formation. Thus, all &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; specimens date to between 76.4 (or less) and 75.6¬†million years ago, in the late Campanian stage.

==Paleobiology==
According to Coombs, &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; may have had cursorial abilities on par with those of the modern rhinoceros and hippopotamus. Based on the form of the humerus-shoulder articulation and the arrangement of the protracting muscles of the upper arm, it appears that the upper arm sloped away from the body. Coombs and Maryanska (1990) observed that &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; specimens are usually discovered as isolated elements or partial skeletons, which suggested that this animal engaged in solitary habits and was usually either solitary or participated in small group clusters.

The armor of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; may have had a keratinous covering, or it may have floated in the skin, as is seen in modern crocodiles. In addition to protection, the heavily vascularized armor may have had a role in thermoregulation. The palpebral bones over the eyes may have provided additional protection for the eyes. Such bones with &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; have been discovered in the upper part of the eye socket, instead of in front of the upper socket rim which is the more common position. Coombs explained this by assuming that these bones were located in the eyelid musculature and were probably mobile enough to be moved over the eyes.

===Defense===
The tail club of ankylosaurids has often been interpreted as a defensive weapon. In &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, the presence of ossified tendons only with the distal half of the tail may support such a function. Because only the distal half of the tail was stiffened by tendons, the anterior half could still move freely from side to side. The ossified tendons would have transmitted the force of the swing to the club and reinforced the supporting vertebrae. The club was likely held just above the ground, as there was not sufficient musculature to raise the tail very high. A 2009 study concluded that &quot;large ankylosaurian clubs could generate sufficient force to break bone during impacts, while average and small ones could not&quot;. It has also concluded that &quot;tail swinging behavior is feasible in ankylosaurids, but it remains unknown whether the tail was used for interspecific defense, intraspecific combat, or both&quot;. The tail club could be swung low, toward the fragile metatarsals or shin bones of attacking theropods.

===Senses and airflow===
&quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; had relatively small eyes, but this does not necessarily mean that it had restricted vision. The complex respiratory passages observed in the skull suggest that &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; had a good sense of smell, although in 1978 an examination of casts of the endocranium did not show an enlarged olfactory region of the brain. Teresa Maryanska, who has worked extensively on Mongolian ankylosaurids, suggested that the respiratory passages were primarily used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones, which are present in &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;.

A 2011 study found that the nasal passages of &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; were looped and complex; possibly an adaptation for heat and water balance and vocal resonance, and researchers discovered an enlarged and vascularised chamber at the back of the nasal tract, which was considered by the authors to be an adaptation to improve its sense of smell. The researchers also managed to reconstruct the dinosaur&#x27;s inner ear and concluded that it was capable of hearing at low frequencies. They suggested that this may have been an adaption to hearing low-toned resonant sounds produced by the nasal passages.

===Diet===
&quot;Euoplocephalus&quot;, like other ankylosaurians, is thought to have been a herbivore. It had a broad muzzle, which could indicate that it was a non-selective feeder, perhaps similar to a hippopotamus. This would provide niche separation from contemporaneous nodosaurids with narrower muzzles. Ankylosaurians have historically been thought of as feeding using simple up-and-down movements of the jaws. Georg Haas (1969) examined the evidence for the jaw muscles of two skulls (AMNH 5337 and 5405) and concluded that despite the large size of the skulls the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement was largely orthogonal, in the vertical plane only. Haas extrapolated from this that dinosaurs like &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; likely ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation.

However, later research indicated that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. &quot;Euoplocephalus&quot; appears to have been able to make more complex movements. Tooth wear and jaw articulations (within the lower jaw and at the lower jaw-quadrate joint) suggest that the lower jaws were pulled back during feeding, and also slightly pivoted inward. This action would have sheared food. A study conducted in 2014 found that the ankylosaurs were capable of eating of tough fibrous plant material, though not to the same degree as their nodosaur relatives or the ceratopsians and hadrosaurs.

<text>The Rodney riots were riots and civil disturbances in Kingston, Jamaica in October 1968.

The riots were sparked by the Jamaican government of Hugh Shearer banning Guyanese university lecturer Dr. Walter Rodney from returning to his teaching position at the University of the West Indies. Rodney, a historian of Africa had been active in the Black power movement, and had been sharply critical of the middle class in many Caribbean countries. Rodney was an avowed socialist who worked with the poor of Jamaica in an attempt to raise their political and cultural consciousness.

When Rodney attended a black writers&#x27; conference in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in October 1968 the government took the opportunity to ban him from returning, citing among other things trips to Cuba and the USSR as justification.

On learning of the ban, students at UWI, Mona began a demonstration under the leadership of the Guild of Undergraduates, closing down the campus. They then proceeded to march first to the prime minister&#x27;s residence, and then to the parliament building in Kingston. On the way many more demonstrators joined in, and eventually the disturbance became increasingly violent spreading across the city. Eventually, several people were killed and there were millions of dollars in property damages.

The riots were part of an emerging black consciousness movement in the Caribbean, and helped inspire the 1970 Black Power Revolution in Trinidad and Tobago.

<doc id="1230094" wikidata="Q815650" url="?curid=1230094" title="Belize River">
<text>The Belize River runs through the center of Belize. It drains more than one-quarter of the country as it winds along the northern edge of the Maya Mountains to the sea just north of Belize City (). The Belize River Valley is largely tropical rainforest.

Also known as the Old River, the Belize River begins where the Mopan River and Macal River join just east of San Ignacio, Belize (). The Belize River ‚Äì Mopan River Catchment contains over 45¬†percent of the population of Belize. The Belize River, in spite of 78 runs or rapids, is passable via the Mopan to the Guatemalan border. It served as the main artery of commerce and communication between the interior and the coast until well into the twentieth century, and has long been associated with forestry, of logwood (for dye) and of mahogany which survives in small stands.

Early on, loggers using the river encountered the Maya and had conflicts with them and with the Spaniards. In 1807 there was a request for &quot;arms and ammunitions&quot; for the loggers. In the late 1820s, the Methodist minister Thomas Wilkinson found three to four thousand men working at camps most of the year. By the late 19th century there were over 130 small settlements along the river. Burrell Boom just above Belize Town served as a catch-point for logs.

Today the Belize River is a vital source of drinking water and other domestic use for the populations living along the river; however, water quality is degraded from sediment, nutrient loading, pesticides and other toxins. The major source of degradation is the extensive deforestation in the upper reaches of the Mopan River and non-sustainable agriculture. Karper and Boles have asserted: &quot;The greater Mopan/Belize River Catchment provides a prime example of a watershed under stress from extensive non-sustainable agricultural practices that have occurred within the region over the past three decades.&quot; Traditional slash and burn agricultural practices also contribute to watershed degradation.

==Maya sites==
There are a number of Maya archaeological sites in the watershed of the Belize River and its tributaries: Mopan River, Macal River, and Chaa Creek. These sites include Xunantunich, Chaa Creek, and Cahal Pech.

<doc id="1230097" wikidata="Q7392881" url="?curid=1230097" title="SR Class 2-NOL">
<text>The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 2-NOL to the electric multiple units built during the 1930s from old London and South Western Railway carriage bodies on new underframes. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class.

==Construction==
The 2-NOL (2-car NO Lavatory stock, numbers 1813‚Äì1890) units were built in 1934‚Äì1936 by taking former LSWR carriage bodies, lengthening them, and placing them on new underframes. They were intended for use on slow services on the South Coast and in South London.

The motor third brakes were produced by taking a 48-foot eight-compartment third (378 of which were built between June 1894 and December 1902 of which 32 were originally 2nd/3rd composites), removing half of one compartment, and adding on a steel-panelled guard&#x27;s van and a driving cab. The driving trailer composites were also produced from 48-foot eight-compartment thirds, but two whole compartments were removed, and three first-class compartments from a 46-foot six-compartment lavatory first (70 of which were built between 1895 and 1900) were added at one end, and a steel-panelled driving cab at the other.

==Formations==
Initial formations of these units were as follows (carriages were not necessarily formed in numerical order):
==Accidents and incidents==

*On 2 December 1955, two units of the class formed a passenger train that was in collision with a freight train at , London due to a signalman&#x27;s error. A fire broke out due to electrical arcing. Thirteen people were killed and 41 were injured. Unit 1853 was gutted by the fire and was consequently withdrawn.

==Withdrawal==
Four units were withdrawn between 1941 and 1955. Of these, two units (1828 and 1855) were withdrawn in 1941, one being the result of bomb damage. Two units sustained accidents in 1951, damaging one coach in each unit; but it was possible to form one good unit from the two undamaged coaches, so only one unit (1838) needed to be withdrawn. Unit 1853 withdrawn following an accident at Barnes in December 1955, as detailed above. The majority of these units were withdrawn between 1956 and 1959, when the old bodies were scrapped and the underframes were re-used. Four units (1870/1/7/8) donated their frames to new 4-EPB coaches, but the frames from 70 units were used to construct 34 new 2-EPB and 36 new 2-HAP units. There remained 31 units in stock in the Summer of 1959, but they had all been withdrawn by the end of August 1959.

<doc id="1230098" wikidata="Q1572723" url="?curid=1230098" title="Port of Hong Kong">
<text>The Port of Hong Kong located by the South China Sea, is a deepwater seaport dominated by trade in containerised manufactured products, and to a lesser extent raw materials and passengers. A key factor in the economic development of Hong Kong, the natural shelter and deep waters of Victoria Harbour provide ideal conditions for berthing and the handling of all types of vessels. It is one of the busiest ports in the world, in the three categories of shipping movements, cargo handled and passengers carried. This makes Hong Kong a Large-Port Metropolis.

==Administration==
The responsibility for administering the port is vested in the Director of Marine. The Port Operations Committee advises the director on all matters in regards to the efficient operations of the port, except those matters that are the responsibility of the Pilotage Advisory Committee and the Provisional Local Vessels Advisory Committee. The Hong Kong Maritime and Port Board (HKMPB) advises the Government on matters related to port planning and development and promoting Hong Kong as a regional hub port and a leading container port in the world as well as on measures to further develop Hong Kong&#x27;s maritime industry and to promote Hong Kong&#x27;s position as an international maritime centre. The HKMPB replaced (in April 2016) the former Hong Kong Maritime Industry Council and Hong Kong Port Development Council and is chaired by the Secretary for Transport and Housing, as they both were.

The Marine Department is responsible for ensuring that conditions exist to enable ships to enter the port, work their :cargoes and leave as quickly and as safely as possible. It is concerned with many aspects of safety standards for all classes and types of vessels, from the largest oil-carrying tankers to the smallest passenger-carrying sampans. It also maintains aids to navigation and mooring buoys for seagoing ships, manages three cross-boundary ferry terminals and administers eight public cargo working areas.

==Shipping==

Hong Kong is one of several hub ports serving the South-East and East Asia region, and is an economic gateway to mainland China. The port is part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe.

Hong Kong set a record in its container throughput in 2007 by handling 23.9 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units of containers), maintaining its status as the largest container port serving southern China and one of the busiest ports in the world. Some 456,000 vessels arrived in and departed from Hong Kong during the year, carrying 243 million tonnes of cargo and about 25 million passengers. The average turnaround time for container vessels in Hong Kong is about 10 hours. For conventional vessels working in mid-stream at buoys or anchorages, it is 42 and 52 hours respectively.

===Container Port traffic===
The port has been one of the busiest container ports in the world for many years, and at times the busiest. It was the world&#x27;s busiest container port from 1987 to 1989, from 1992 to 1997, and from 1999 to 2004.
The amount of container ships that went through Hong Kong&#x27;s container port was 25,869 in 2016, with a net register tonnage of 386,853 tonnes in 2016.

===Container terminals===
There are currently nine container terminals situated at Kwai Chung, Stonecutters Island and Tsing Yi (the last one completed in 2004). Substantial container throughput is handled by the River Trade Terminal at Tuen Mun and by mid-stream.

====Kwai Tsing Container Terminals====


The Kwai Tsing Container Terminals (Kwai Chung Container Terminals until Container Terminal 9 was opened on Tsing Yi), located in the north-western part of the harbour, has nine container terminals with 24 berths of about 8,500 metres of frontage. It covers a total terminal area of about 2.7¬†km2 which includes container yards and container freight stations. The nine container terminals have a total handling capacity of over .

These terminals are operated by five companies, namely:
* Modern Terminals Ltd. (MTL)
* Hongkong International Terminals Ltd. (HIT)
* COSCO Information &amp; Technology (H.K.) Ltd. (COSCO)
* Dubai Port International Terminals Ltd. (DPI)
* Asia Container Terminals Ltd. (ACT)

The existing 9 terminals occupy 2.17 square kilometres of land, providing 18 berths and 6,592 metres deep water frontage. These terminals handle about 60% of total container traffic handled in Hong Kong.

In July, 2020, The Port of Hong Kong welcomed HMM Gdansk, the world&#x27;s largest container vessel, on its maiden call to Hong Kong at Kwai Tsing Container Terminal 7.

Planning is underway for a potential Container Terminal 10 (CT10), with possible sites narrowed down to either southwest Tsing Yi or northwest Lantau, to the west of the airport.

====River Trade Terminal at Tuen Mun====
The River Trade Terminal at Tuen Mun involves the consolidation of containers, breakbulk, and bulk cargo shipped between the Hong Kong port and ports in the Pearl River Delta. The terminal is located near Pillar Point in Tuen Mun, New Territories, and is operated by River Trade Terminal Company Ltd. The 65-hectare terminal, completed in November 1999, has about 3,000 meters of quay, according to Hong Kong Port Development Council data.

===Mid-stream===
Mid-stream operation involves loading and unloading containers to and from ships while at sea, with barges or dumb steel lighters performing the transfer, and then distributing or landing the containers to piers nearby. Due to high handling fees at the container terminals, Hong Kong has become the only place in the world with at-sea loading and unloading operations.

Currently, there are 11 different yard sites solely for mid-stream operations, occupying a total land area of 27.5 hectares and waterfrontage of 3,197 metres.

==Ferry services==
The Hong Kong‚ÄìMacau Ferry Terminal between Central and Sheung Wan and the China Ferry Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui provide centralised ferry services to Macau and 24 ports on mainland China. About 100 vessels, mostly high-speed passenger craft such as jetfoils, catamarans and hoverferries, operate from these terminals. In 2001, over 17 million passengers passed through the terminals, comprising approximately 11.2 million passenger trips to/from Macau and 6.5 million passenger trips to/from mainland ports.

==Government fleet==
There are over 600 vessels of different types and sizes in the government fleet. About 152 vessels are major mechanised vessels serving under 16 government departments such as the Marine Police, Customs and Excise, and Fire Services. Some user departments operate and man their purpose-built vessels. The Marine Department itself controls about 100 vessels, including patrol launches, personnel carriers, pontoons, self-propelled barges and specialised vessels such as hydrographic survey launches and explosive carriers. These vessels provide support to the department&#x27;s own port operations or serve other departments which do not have their own fleet. The Government Dockyard is responsible for the design, procurement and maintenance of all vessels owned by the Government. It occupies a site of 980,000 m2 on Stonecutters Island and has an 83,000 m2 protected water basin as an operational base for vessels operated by the Marine Department. The dockyard has a ship-lift system and three ship-hoists capable of drydocking vessels of up to 750 tonnes. An on-line computerised information system is employed to co-ordinate the maintenance activities and support services to maximise maintenance efficiency and vessel availability.

==Drydocks and slipways==
The port has extensive facilities for repairing, maintaining, drydocking and slipping of all types of vessels. Two floating drydocks are located off the west coast of Tsing Yi Island and two northeast of Lantau Island. The largest is capable of docking vessels up to . There is also a large number of smaller shipyards, which carry out repairs to vessels and build specialised craft, including sophisticated patrol craft and pleasure vessels for overseas markets.

==Port facilities and services==
===Moorings and anchorages===
The Marine Department operates and maintains 58 mooring buoys for seagoing vessels. Of these 31 are suitable for ships up to 183 metres in length and 27 for ships up to 137 metres. There are 44 special typhoon mooring buoys to which ships can remain secured during typhoons. This improves efficiency and reduces operational costs of vessels through elimination of unnecessary movements. In addition to the three Immigration and Quarantine Anchorages designated for visiting vessels to complete port formalities, there are eight dangerous goods and eight general-purpose anchorages providing temporary berthing spaces for vessels.

The areas and water depths of the anchorages are diversified to accommodate different sizes and draughts of ships calling at Hong Kong. There are over 460 modern marine aids to navigation throughout Hong Kong waters to guide mariners to and from their berths.

===Navigation safety===
All fairway buoys are lit and fitted with radar reflectors. Traffic Separation Schemes operate in the East Lamma Channel and Tathong Channel. The Marine Department&#x27;s VHF radio network provides comprehensive marine communication coverage throughout the harbour and its approaches. The department has direct communication links with other maritime authorities and users worldwide. Locally, the department&#x27;s Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) maintains direct contact with emergency response services, which include the Government Flying Service, Marine Police and Fire Services. MRCC provides 24-hour maritime distress alert monitoring and co-ordinates all maritime search and rescue operations within the Hong Kong search and rescue region in the South China Sea.

A comprehensive vessel traffic service is provided by the department&#x27;s Vessel Traffic Centre (VTC), with radar surveillance and tracking capabilities as well as a fully integrated data handling sub-system, covers 95% of Hong Kong waters used by seagoing vessels and ferries. The VTC offers advice on the activities of other vessels and gives navigational information to mariners through a sectorised VHF network. This ensures the safety standard and traffic efficiency of the port. An upgraded vessel tracking system, which can track 4,000 moving vessels plus 1,000 stationary targets in real time, has been in operation since early 2002. It provides the latest technology such as AIS, ECDIS, CCTV, new VHF-direction finders and modern communications systems to further improve navigation safety and operation efficiency. Marine Department patrol launches maintain a watch on shipping, traffic separation schemes, fairways, navigational channels, typhoon shelter and cargo-working areas. They provide on-scene support to the VTC, and are in continuous radio contact with the VTC and local marine traffic control stations located at Ma Wan and Kwai Chung Container Port. The VTC is thus able to promptly initiate and co-ordinate actions required to facilitate safe navigation in the port.

The Hydrographic Office of the Marine Department surveys Hong Kong waters and produces nautical charts to facilitate safe navigation within the port. It functions with reference to the standards laid down by the International Hydrographic Organisation (IHO). Notices to Mariners are promulgated fortnightly to update bilingual nautical charts. A Differential Global Positioning System correction signal is broadcast continuously on 289¬†kHz to assist mariners using GPS navigation to position-fix their vessels more accurately. Tidal height predictions and real-time tidal information are provided on the department&#x27;s website. Pilotage is compulsory for ships of 3,000 gross tons and above and gas carriers of any tonnage. Quarantine and immigration facilities are available on a 24-hour basis. Advance immigration clearance and radio pratique may be obtained by certain vessels on application.

===Dangerous goods===
Dangerous goods are moved in the waters of Hong Kong strictly in accordance with the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code. Their movements must be recorded in the Marine Department&#x27;s Dangerous Goods Information System. Firefighting vessels operated by the Fire Services Department are kept in a state of readiness at all times. The Marine Department&#x27;s pollution control vessels are on 24-hour standby to deal with oil spills.

===Other working facilities===
To facilitate transfer of cargo between vessels and the shore, and cargo to and from Pearl River ports, the Marine Department provides and manages 7,756 metres of public cargo-working sea frontage in various parts of Hong Kong. Bulk handling facilities for coal and oil are provided at the power generating stations at Tap Shek Kok in Castle Peak and at Po Lo Tsui on Lamma Island.

==Hong Kong Shipping Register==

Hong Kong is a major centre of ship ownership and management. Ships owned or managed in Hong Kong amount to 100 million gross tons. Hong Kong has been recognised by the international shipping sector as a first-rate ship registration centre, where registration of ships is entirely voluntary. At the end of 2001, 653 ships were registered in Hong Kong, with a total gross tonnage of 13.7 million tons ‚Äì a 32 per cent growth over the previous year. The Hong Kong Shipping Register operates independently in its maritime policy and administration. The HKSAR Government issues related certificates under its own legislation in the name of &#x27;Hong Kong, China&#x27;. As a quality shipping register, Hong Kong adopts all major international conventions promulgated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). As an associate member of the IMO, the Government ensures that ships registered in Hong Kong are maintained to the highest international safety and marine environmental protection standards.

A Flag State Quality Control (FSQC) System was introduced in 1999 to monitor the performance of authorised classification societies and to maintain the quality of ships on the Hong Kong shipping register. Any Hong Kong-registered ship whose quality standard is found to be declining or which is detained by a port state for serious deficiencies will be subject to FSQC inspections by Marine Department surveyors. The department regulates the safety standards of all locally licensed vessels, currently numbering over 10,000. Marine Department surveyors also carry out surveys of new vessels being built abroad for licensing in Hong Kong. Examinations are held regularly for the issuance of both foreign-going and river-trade certificates of competency for masters, deck officers and engineers. In addition, local certificates of competency are issued to coxswains and engineers of locally licensed vessels, which operate within the waters of Hong Kong. An inspection and advice service is provided to promote safe working practices in ship-repairing, ship breaking, cargo-handling on ships and safety afloat.

==Seafarers==
Hong Kong is a centre for employment of seafarers. 1,200 Hong Kong officers and ratings serve on board more than 420 seagoing ships of 12 different maritime nations. The mercantile marine office registers seafarers, regulates their employment on board ships of all flags and supervises the employment and discharge of seafarers on Hong Kong ships and foreign ships not represented in Hong Kong by a consulate office.

<doc id="1230103" wikidata="Q371762" url="?curid=1230103" title="Yenish people">
<text>The Yenish (; , ) are an itinerant group in Western Europe who live mostly in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium, and parts of France, roughly centered on the Rhineland. A number of theories for the group&#x27;s origins have been proposed, notingly that the Yenish descended from members of the marginalized and vagrant poor classes of society of the early modern period, including persecuted Ashkenazi jews and gypsies, before emerging as a distinct group by the early 19th century. Most of the Yenish became sedentary in the course of the mid-19th to 20th centuries.

The language of the Yenishes, called Yenish, has a grammatical syntax borrowed from the German language and its vocabulary is a mixture of Yiddish, Hebrew and German with some French and Romani terms.

== Origin ==

The origin of Yenish peoples is unclear but it would be linked to a gradual interbreeding over the centuries between itinerant German and Ashkenazi Jewish populations, then the integration of certain members of the Gypsy communities: indeed, according to Yaron Matras of the University of Manchester, the Yenish community has, over the centuries, integrated members of minority communities such as Gypsies and Jews who, for one reason or another, left their own communities. This hypothesis is shared by R√©my Welschinger, who specifies that, due to the various wars and numerous food shortages, Jews and Yenishes were forced to live marginally by exercising professions which required great mobility and that the two peoples were able to settle and their languages to mix. In this hypothesis, the Yenish language would mainly come from the mixture of Rotwelsch, the language of the marginalized of Germanic origin, and Yiddish and Hebrew, the languages of the Ashkenazi Jews, when the poor and marginalized itinerant German populations absorbed, notably via mixed unions, the Jews rejected on the road, following the persecutions carried out against them at the time. According to Sandrine Szwarc also raises the hypothesis that the Yenishes are, at least for certain families, descendants of Ashkenazi crypto-Jews. 

Klaus Vater answers the question ‚ÄúWho are they?‚Äù in the article ‚ÄúDas vergessene Volk‚Äù: ‚ÄúI am writing about a group of people that has existed for centuries and, as mentioned, has its own language and music. It is very likely that they arose when, at the end of the Middle Ages, the dispossessed, people without knowledge useful for the cities, the impoverished and the persecuted came together with Jewish groups, with former mercenaries and strangers. They also met Sinti or Roma who were pushing towards Europe.‚Äù .

Interestingly, according to the encyclopedia of Hebrew languages and linguistics, jenisch &quot;words of Hebrew origin, such as laf ‚Äòno‚Äô (= ◊ú◊ê◊ï lav) and Schuck ‚Äòmarket‚Äô (= ◊©◊ï◊ß ≈°uq), entered Jenisch with the Ashkenazi pronunciation employed when Hebrew words were integrated in the Judeo-German speech 
of German Jews&quot;, that is to say before its modification in contact with Slavic languages.

== Name ==
The Yenish people as a distinct group, as opposed to the generic class of vagrants of the early modern period, emerged towards the end of the 18th century. The adjective is first recorded in the early 18th century in the sense of &quot;cant, argot&quot;. A self-designation is recorded in 1793. remained strictly an adjective that refers to the language, not the people, until the first half of the 19th century. Jean Paul (1801) glosses (&quot;Yenish language&quot;) with (&quot;this is the term used in Swabia for an argot used by rogues which has been cobbled together from all sorts of languages&quot;). An anonymous author in 1810 argues that is a deprecating term, equivalent to &quot;card sharp&quot;, and that the proper designation for the people should be , &quot;Gasche&quot; being a slang word derived from the Romani term for &#x27;non-Romani&#x27;.

== Germany ==
Many Yenish people in Germany became sedentary in the second half of the 19th century. The Kingdom of Prussia in 1842 introduced a law forcing municipalities to provide social welfare to permanent residents without citizenship. As a consequence, there were attempts to prevent Yenish people from taking permanent residence. Recently established settlements of Yenish, Sinti, and Roma, dubbed &quot;gypsy colonies&quot; (), were discouraged and attempts were made to incite the settlers to move away, in the form of various forms of harassment, and in some cases physical attacks. By the late 19th century, many recently sedentary Yenish were nevertheless integrated into local populations, gradually moving away from their tradition of endogamy thus being absorbed into the general German population. Those Yenish who did not become sedentary by the late 19th century took to living in trailers.

The persecution of Romani people under Nazi Germany beginning in 1933 was directed not exclusively against the Romani people but also targeted &quot;vagrants who travel around after the manner of the gypsies&quot; (&quot;), which included the Yenish and people without permanent residence in general. Travellers were scheduled for internment in Buchenwald, Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Neuengamme. Yenish families began to be registered in a (&#x27;archive of travelling families&#x27;), but this effort was incomplete by the end of World War II. It appears that only very limited numbers of Yenish (compared with the number of Romani victims) were actually deported: five Yenish individuals are on record as having been deported from Cologne, and a total of 279 (&#x27;caravan dwellers&#x27;) are known to have been deported from the Netherlands in 1944. Lewy (2001) has discovered one case of the deportation of a Yenish woman in 1939. The Yenish people are mentioned as a persecuted group in the text of the 2012 Memorial to the Sinti and Roma Victims of National Socialism in Berlin.

== Switzerland ==
In 2001, Swiss National Councillor Remo Galli, as speaker of the foundation , reported an estimate of 35,000 &quot;travellers&quot; (, a term combining Sinti, Roma and Yenish), both sedentary and non-sedentary, in Switzerland, among them an estimated 20,000 Yenish people. Mariella Mehr had already claimed in 1979 that there were &quot;about 20,000 Yenish&quot;, among whom only &quot;a handful of families who are still travelling&quot;.

From the 1920s until the 1970s, the Swiss government had a semi-official policy of institutionalizing Yenish parents as mentally ill and having their children adopted by members of the sedentary Swiss population. The name of this program was (&#x27;Children of the Road&#x27;). The separation of children was justified as the Yenish being a &#x27;criminal milieu&#x27; of &#x27;homelessness and vagrancy&#x27; was later criticized as a violation of the fundamental rights of the Yenishe to family life, with children separated from parents by force without due criminal procedure, and resulting in many of the children suffering an ordeal of successive foster homes and orphanages. In all, 590 children were taken from their parents and institutionalized in orphanages, mental institutions, and even prisons. Child removals peaked in the 1930s to 1940s, in the years leading up to and during World War II. After public criticism in 1972, the program was discontinued in 1973. In February 2025, the Swiss government formally acknowledged that the forced removals and assimilation efforts targeting the Yenish, Manouche, and Sinti people under the ‚ÄúChildren of the Open Road‚Äù program constitute a crime against humanity under international law. 

An organisation for the political representation of travellers (Yenish as well as Sinti and Roma) was founded in 1975, named (&quot;Wheel Cooperative of the Road&quot;). The Swiss federal authorities have officially recognized the &quot;Swiss Yenish and Sinti&quot; as a &quot;national minority&quot;. With the ratification of the European language charter in 1997, Switzerland has given the status of a &quot;territorial non-tied language&quot; to the Yenish language.

== Austria ==
Around 1800, a group of Yenish settled in Loosdorf near Melk, and since then a language island of Yenish has existed there. In November 2021, on the initiative of linguist Heidi Schleich and now chairman Marco Buckovez, the association (Yenish in Austria) was founded with headquarters in Innsbruck. As part of a meeting with the ethnic group spokespersons of the parliamentary parties, the association submitted a request for recognition in accordance with the Ethnic Groups Act on 23 March 2022.

== France ==
While there are references to Yenish people in France, there are no reported figures. wrote in a 1991 article in the journal that the Yenish &quot;probably form the largest group of travellers in France today&quot;.

<text>The Rotsee (previously known as Rootsee) is a natural rowing lake on the northern edge of Lucerne, Switzerland. It is regarded as one of the best rowing venues in the world.

==Description and location==
The lake and its surrounding area is used for local recreation. All of the lake frontage is a protected area. The lake formed through glacial processes and it is thought that the river Reuss flowed through this valley in between ice ages. There is no notable inflow and virtually no current. Nearby hills protect the lake from wind. It is long. These factors make it an ideal rowing venue and German-speaking rower refer to it as &quot;G√∂ttersee&quot;, which translates as &quot;lake of the gods&quot;. The expression was coined at the 1962 World Rowing Championships by a Japanese rowing official.

The Zug‚ÄìLucerne railway is located north of the lake. The south side of the lake has residential land use. The Ron is a creek that is the lake&#x27;s outflow; it flows into the Reuss at Root.

==History==

Since 1885, the Rotsee was used for ice cutting, which was stored in insulated cellars lasting until autumn. Up to 80 people were employed, with the ice used by the hotel industry and brewers. This business ceased during the 1910s when refrigerators became more economical. With its proximity to Lucerne, the Rotsee and its surrounding area has been used for local recreation since the mid 18th century. An army ammunition depot next to the Rotsee exploded in 1916, resulting in five deaths and thousands of grenades being thrown in the lake. Recreational divers spotted some grenades during the 1970s and Police divers have since recovered about 1000 grenades from the lake. Police and army last found grenades in 2020 and it is assumed that there are still more explosives in the lake.

Increasing housing in the area, with sewage discharge into the lake, resulted in ecological decline. The sewage treatment plants built at the lake in 1922 and 1929 belonged to the first installations in Switzerland, but the tension about ecological decline peaked in the 1920s. This gave rise to the founding of a society &quot;Gesellschaft Pro Rotsee&quot; in 1929 with the aim of saving the lake. In 1922, a canal was built that diverted water from the river Reuss into the Rotsee, but since the Reuss was also polluted, this did not significantly improve water quality. Significant improvements were achieved in 1974, when all domestic discharge was diverted to the new sewage treatment plant in Schiltwald (part of Emmen).

The society was eventually given a lease of the lake by the city of Lucerne. The name of the society has since changed to &quot;Quartierverein Maihof&quot;, which leases the lake to this day.

==Rowing==

The Swiss national rowing championships, the first regatta on the Rotsee, was hosted in 1933. European Rowing Championships were held here in 1934 and 1947, and again in 2019. The inaugural World Rowing Championships were held in 1962, with subsequent world championships in 1974, 1982 and 2001. The Final Olympic Qualification Regatta (FOQR) was held at the Rotsee in May 2021 as a qualification event for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

The lake is the venue for the final leg of the World Rowing Cup series. When a World Championships is also being held in Lucerne (as happened in 2001) then no World Cup race is held on the lake.

<text>Muhammad Ali (; ‚Äé; 1874 ‚Äì 13 October 1951) was a British Indian, and a Pakistani writer, scholar, and leading figure of the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement.

==Biography==
Ali was born in Murar, Kapurthala State (now in Ludhiana district, Punjab, India) in 1874. He obtained a Master of Arts in English and a Bachelor of Laws in 1899. He joined the Ahmadiyya Movement in 1897 and dedicated his life to the service of the movement as part of what he saw as a restored and pristine Islam. He died in Karachi on October 13, 1951, and is buried in Lahore.

Marmaduke Pickthall, British Muslim and translator of the Quran into English, wrote a review of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s book &quot;The Religion of Islam&quot; when this book was published in 1936. The review was published in the journal &quot;Islamic Culture&quot; of Hyderabad Deccan (India), whose editor was Pickthall. In this review Pickthall wrote:

<text>Mount Wuteve, also known as Mount Wologizi, is a mountain located in Liberia, whose summit is the highest point in Liberia.

==Geography==
The mountain is located in the Guinea Highlands range. Data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission revealed that the summit is higher in elevation than the previously quoted 1,380 meters. As of 2024, the elevation is understood to be 1,447 meters. The Wuteve or Wologizi ridge, including several other associated peaks, extends for 22¬†km with spurs of up to 5¬†km on each side. The slopes are steep, forming cliffs up to 100¬†m high in places.

===Environment===
The lower slopes are covered with open forest characterised by &quot;Lophira&quot;, &quot;Pycnanthus&quot;, &quot;Tarrietia&quot;, &quot;Albizia&quot;, &quot;Samanea&quot; and &quot;Cryptosepalum&quot; tree species. With increasing elevation, forest height decreases and the understorey denser. Above 1,000¬†m the dominant trees‚Äî&quot;Parinari&quot; and &quot;Ouratea&quot; species‚Äîare stunted. The foothills are surrounded by areas of savanna woodland.

The massif has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of many bird species. Forest elephants and western chimpanzees are present.

<doc id="1230145" wikidata="Q2311941" url="?curid=1230145" title="Lake Malta">
<text>Lake Malta, known also as the Malta≈Ñski Reservoir, is an artificial lake in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland. It was formed in 1952 as a result of the damming of the Cybina River. It is about 2.2¬†km long (with the circuit of 5,6 km), which makes the lake the biggest man-made lake of the city. The water is 3.1 m deep on average with a maximum about 5 m. There are a number of recreational attractions along the edge of the lake including:
*an artificial ski slope,
*an artificial ice rink,
*a zoological garden,
*Kolejka Parkowa Maltanka - a narrow gauge railway,
*the Mound of Freedom,
*seasonal bikes rental - MaltaBike

The lake also has one of the oldest man-made rowing venues in Europe - &quot;The Malta Regatta Course&quot;. This dates back to 1952 and has held a number of Rowing World Cup events. It also hosted the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships in 1990 and 2001, and did so again in 2010.

The lake also gives its name to the Malta theatre festival, held in Pozna≈Ñ annually in June, with some of the shows taking place next to the lake.

The name of the lake comes from the Knights Hospitaller also known as &quot;Knights of Malta&quot;. The lake was built on land owned by Church of St. John of Jerusalem Outside the Walls, given to the order in 1187 by duke Mieszko III the Old.

Because of the importance of the lake for the city of Pozna≈Ñ, various methods to improve its water quality have been investigated.

<doc id="1230149" wikidata="Q7450049" url="?curid=1230149" title="Senator Claghorn">
<text>Senator Beauregard Claghorn was a popular fictional radio character on the &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot; segment of &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot;, beginning in 1945. Succeeding the vaguely similar but much less popular Senator Bloat from the earliest &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot; routines, Senator Claghorn, portrayed by Allen&#x27;s announcer Kenny Delmar, was a blustery Southern politician whose home was usually the first at which Allen would knock. Claghorn would typically answer the door with, &quot;Somebody, ah say, somebody knocked! Claghorn&#x27;s the name, Senator Claghorn, that is. I&#x27;m from the South. Suh.&quot;

==Description==
Claghorn had an unshakable obsession with the South, and would happily complain about the North in dry ways. For instance, the Senator refused to ever wear a &quot;Union suit&quot; or drive through the Lincoln Tunnel when he visited New York City, and he claimed to drink only out of Dixie cups. At one point when asked which state he represented, he noted it was in the Gulf of Mexico, south of Alabama. The senator even rebuked Fred Allen for saying the word &quot;no&quot; in his presence, saying &quot;N-O.. That&#x27;s North abbreviated!!&quot;

Some of the senator&#x27;s other quotes include:
* &quot;When I&#x27;m in New York I&#x27;ll never go to Yankee Stadium!&quot;
* &quot;I won&#x27;t even go to see the Giants unless a southpaw&#x27;s pitchin&#x27;!&quot;
* &quot;I refuse to watch the Dodgers unless Dixie Walker&#x27;s playin&#x27;!&quot;
* &quot;I won&#x27;t go into a room unless it&#x27;s got southern exposure!&quot;
* &quot;When I got the chickenpox, they were southern fried!&quot;
* &quot;The only plant life I have around my house is a Virginia creeper!&quot;
* &quot;Son, bend down and kiss my Jefferson Davis button!&quot;

When Allen was finally able to speak to the senator, he would ask him a topical question, to which Claghorn would respond with a rapid stream of talk, shouting, repetition and puns. After a quip, the senator would laugh uproariously and utter one of his two catchphrases: &quot;That&#x27;s a joke, son!&quot; or &quot;Pay attention now, boy!&quot; Claghorn would also make frequent jabs at Allen using colorful analogies that often resulted in loud laughter from the studio audience.

Delmar debuted Claghorn on Allen&#x27;s broadcast of October 7, 1945, and the character remained until 1949, when the series transitioned from &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot; to a &quot;Main Street&quot; segment to accommodate Allen&#x27;s final sponsor, Ford. In one episode, Allen asked the senator how he was treating his insomnia, and the senator replied that he had sung himself to sleep with a southern lullaby:

::&quot;Rock-a-bye small fry, on the cotton tree top,
::when the Southern wind blows, your cradle will rock,
::when the wind&#x27;s from the North, I say, baby you&#x27;ll bawl,
::for down will come cradle, tree and you all!&quot;

In another exchange, Allen asked Claghorn whether Washington was helping to reduce an epidemic of colds afflicting the country. Claghorn responded: &quot;The senate, I say the senate reconvened just in time. I was glad to see Senator [George] Aiken back. Achin&#x27; back! That&#x27;s a joke, son.&quot; Further discussion regarding cold remedies resulted in this exchange:

:Claghorn: I had a cold last week like to ruin my filibuster.
:Allen: Ruin your filibuster? Well what did- (chuckling) what did you do?
:Claghorn: I took an old Southern remedy, son. I drank down two buckets of hot mint julep.
:Allen: (astonished) You drank two buckets of hot mint julep and you still held the floor?
:Claghorn: Held the floor?! Son, I couldn&#x27;t get up off&#x27;n it!

Allen&#x27;s interview with Claghorn generally ended with him bellowing &quot;So long! So long, that is!!&quot; (usually over laughter and applause from the audience)

At the height of its popularity, the character was often mentioned or parodied on other programs, especially that of Allen&#x27;s rival Jack Benny, with Phil Harris usually playing the part. Delmar made a guest appearance on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; in the role on February 12, 1950, months after Allen&#x27;s show had ended. The most famous parody is the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; animated character Foghorn Leghorn.

==Outside of radio==
The Claghorn character also appeared in other media. Delmar played the character in commercials, on two records (&quot;I Love You, That Is&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s a Joke, Son&quot;), and a 1947 theatrical film titled &quot;It&#x27;s a Joke, Son!&quot; with costar Una Merkel as Mrs. Claghorn. The film&#x27;s plot involves the senator running for office against his wife. &quot;It&#x27;s a Joke, Son!&quot; was produced on an unusually low $650,000 budget and suffered from poor box-office receipts, causing it to be pulled from some theaters after less than a week.

Delmar played a thinly veiled version of Claghorn, retitled Senator Hominy Smith, in the Broadway musical &quot;Texas Li&#x27;l Darlin&quot;. After Warner Bros. copyrighted Foghorn Leghorn, Delmar required the studio&#x27;s permission to play the character elsewhere. In the 1960s, Delmar took his characterization and catchphrases back as the voice of the Hunter, a character on the animated series &quot;King Leonardo and His Short Subjects&quot;.

Dave Sim adopted the same speech patterns for Elrod the Albino, a character in his independent comic book &quot;Cerebus the Aardvark&quot;, but it is unknown whether the voice derived directly from Claghorn or from Foghorn Leghorn. Sim describes the character as &quot;Elrod/Senator Claghorn&quot; in the preface to the reprint of issue 51 in &quot;Cerebus Number Zero&quot;.

<doc id="1230153" wikidata="Q1445326" url="?curid=1230153" title="Franklinia">
<text>Franklinia is a monotypic genus in the tea family, Theaceae. The sole species in this genus is a flowering tree, Franklinia alatamaha, commonly called the Franklin tree, and native to the Altamaha River valley in Georgia in the southeastern United States. It has been extinct in the wild since the early 19th century, but survives as a cultivated ornamental tree.

In the past, some botanists have included &quot;Franklinia&quot; within the related genus &quot;Gordonia&quot;. The southeastern North American species &quot;Gordonia lasianthus&quot; differs in having evergreen foliage, flowers with longer stems, winged seeds, and conical seed capsules. &quot;Franklinia&quot; was often known as &quot;Gordonia pubescens&quot; until the middle of the 20th century.

&quot;Franklinia&quot; is now thought to be closer in relation to the Asian genus &quot;Schima&quot;. Recent DNA studies and examinations of floral ontogeny in the Theaceae place &quot;Franklinia&quot; together with &quot;Gordonia&quot; and &quot;Schima&quot; in a subtribe. Hybrid crosses have been produced between &quot;Franklinia alatamaha&quot; and &quot;Gordonia lasianthus&quot;, and between &quot;Franklinia alatamaha&quot; and &quot;Schima argentea&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Franklinia alatamaha&quot; is a small deciduous tree growing to tall, but commonly . It is prized for its fragrant white flowers, similar to single white &quot;Camellia&quot; blossoms; the smell may remind some of orange blossoms or honeysuckle. The tree has a symmetrical, somewhat pyramidal shape, often with different individuals of the species forming almost identical crowns. It frequently suckers and can form several vertical trunks close to ground level. The bark is gray with vertical white striations and has a ridged texture. The alternate, obovate leaves are up to in length and turn a bright orange-red in the fall. Although difficult to transplant, once established, &quot;F. alatamaha&quot; can live a century or more.

The seed capsules require 12‚Äì14 months to mature. Unlike almost all angiosperms, &quot;Franklinia alatamaha&quot; exhibits zygotic dormancy. It pollinates in late summer or early autumn, is then dormant over winter, and only sets fruit during the subsequent summer. Female gametophytes are mature prior to pollination, with double fertilization occurring soon after pollination. The zygote becomes dormant immediately after fertilization with delay of development until the following summer. Initial development of endosperm occurs for up to 3 months after fertilization but comes to a standstill at winter&#x27;s onset. With onset of the following summer, embryogenesis begins and endosperm development restarts. This overwinter zygotic dormancy is extremely rare among temperate angiosperms. When ripe the pentavalved spherical capsules split above and below in a unique manner.

==History==

&quot;No tree which ornaments our gardens has a more romantic history,&quot; begins a lengthy 1933 article published in &quot;The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography&quot;. The history of &quot;Franklinia&quot;&#x27;s discovery in coastal Georgia, followed by disappearance in the wild, and saved only by its ability to grow, flower, and seed in the Philadelphia garden of its initial collector entail the main thread of the unusual botanical history.
Philadelphia botanists John and William Bartram first observed the tree growing along the Altamaha River near Fort Barrington in the British colony of Georgia in October 1765. John Bartram recorded &quot;severall very curious shrubs&quot; in his journal entry for October 1, 1765. William Bartram returned several times to the same location on the Altamaha during a collecting trip to the American South, funded by Dr. John Fothergill of London. William Bartram collected &quot;F. alatamaha&quot; seeds during this extended trip to the South from 1773 through 1776, a journey described in his book &quot;Bartram&#x27;s Travels&quot; published in Philadelphia in 1791. William Bartram brought seed back to Philadelphia in 1777 at which time William reported to his father that he had relocated the plant, but this time had been able to retrieve its seeds although it was not until after John&#x27;s death (1777) that he was able to achieve flowering plants (1781). After several years of study, William Bartram assigned the &quot;rare and elegant flowering shrub&quot; to a new genus &quot;Franklinia&quot;, named in honor of his father&#x27;s great friend Benjamin Franklin. The new plant name, &quot;Franklinia alatamaha&quot;, was first published by a Bartram cousin, Humphry Marshall, in 1785 in his catalogue of North American trees and shrubs entitled &quot;Arbustrum Americanum&quot;. (Marshall 1785: 48‚Äì50; Fry 2001).

William Bartram was the first to report the extremely limited distribution of &quot;Franklinia&quot;. &quot;We never saw it grow in any other place, nor have I ever since seen it growing wild, in all my travels, from Pennsylvania to Point Coupe, on the banks of the Mississippi, which must be allowed a very singular and unaccountable circumstance; at this place there are two or of ground where it grows plentifully.&quot; (W. Bartram 1791: 468). After returning to Georgia after the American Revolution, Bartram was unable to find the trees.

The tree was last verified in the wild in 1803 by the English plant collector John Lyon (although there are hints it may have been present into at least the 1840s). The cause of its extinction in the wild is not known, but has been attributed to a number of causes including fire, flood, overcollection by plant collectors, and fungal disease introduced with the cultivation of cotton plants.

All the Franklin trees known to exist today are descended from seed collected by William Bartram and propagated at Bartram&#x27;s Garden in Philadelphia. It has now been cultivated in over 1000 sites worldwide including botanical gardens, private homes, parks, and cemeteries. It is suggested that more than one tree was sampled by Bartram during his original collection in Georgia and the diversity was maintained over the years. To mark the 300th anniversary of John Bartram&#x27;s birth in 1998, Bartram&#x27;s Garden launched a project to locate as many &quot;Franklinia&quot; trees as possible.

==Status as a glacial relict==

There have been efforts to reintroduce the species to its native habitat. Twenty-four individuals were planted between 2002 and 2003 in the Altamaha Wildlife Management Area; however, they were unsuccessful. The idea of reintroduction was long controversial for some plant enthusiasts who believed wild populations may still exist. The lack of success in returning an extinct-in-the-wild plant to its formerly native range is not unexpected for those aware of Franklinia&#x27;s status as a glacial relict.

In eastern North America, lowland glacial refuges along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts host endemic plants ‚Äî some of which are rare, even endangered, and others entail the most southerly disjunct populations of plants that commonly appear only hundreds of miles to the north. Major rivers draining southward from the Appalachian Mountains are associated with a gradation of paleoendemic tree species. These range from the extinct Critchfield spruce near the outlet of the Mississippi River, to extinct-in-the-wild &quot;Franklinia&quot; along the Altamaha River, to the critically endangered Florida torreya and Florida yew at the downstream end of the Chattahoochee River system. (See illustration at right.)

As with Florida torreya, the relictual status of the now-extinct wild population of Franklinia near the mouth of a major river draining the Appalachian Mountains southward makes investigation of proximal causes of disease secondary to the likelihood of the plant having lost viability as the Holocene warmed. While seeds may passively float long distances downstream, this mode of dispersal became unavailable for making the reverse trip back to the mountains to track a warming climate. As with Florida torreya, evidence that climate warming accounts as ultimate cause is reinforced by today&#x27;s disease-free health of horticultural plantings far to the north (Cleveland, Ohio, for Florida torreya). Northward growing successes contrast with professional failures that have attempted to restore either species to reproductive health in their refugial riverside patches where each apparently survived peak episodes of glacial cold during the Pleistocene epoch.

==Cultivation==
The Franklin tree has a reputation among gardeners for being difficult to cultivate, especially in urban environments. It prefers sandy, high-acid soil, and does not tolerate compacted clay soil, excessive moisture, or any disturbance to its roots. The Franklin tree has no known pests, but it is subject to root-rot and crown-rot caused by &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; and does not endure drought well. It is commercially available for garden cultivation.

It is one of two species of trees in the tea family that only exists in cultivation, the other being &quot;Camellia amplexicaulis&quot;.

<text>Alandi (Marathi pronunciation: ) is a town and a municipal council in the Pune district in the state of Maharashtra, India. The town is popular as a place of pilgrimage and for being the resting place of the 13th century Marathi saint Sant Dnyaneshwar.

==History==

Alandi has a long history but gained prominence in the 13th century when Dnyaneshwar (1275‚Äì1296) decided to entomb, otherwise known as &quot;sanjeevan samadhi&quot;, himself in a samadhi, a form of shrine, under the then existing Siddheshwar temple complex in 1296.
A temple was built over the Samadhi by Ambekar Deshpande in around 1580‚Äì1600. Further additions to the temple were made during the Maratha Empire era by Maratha nobles and the Peshwa. In 1778, Alandi was granted to Mahadji Shinde, the powerful Maratha statesman of the Maratha confederacy at that time, by the Peshwa. For two decades after that, the Shinde family were the main sponsors of various renovations of the temple.

In the 1820s, Haibatrao Buva Arphalkar Pawar, a courtier of the Scindia of Gwalior, started the modern Palkhi tradition of carrying the paduka (replica silver sandals) of Dnyaneshwar to Pandharpur during the annual Wari. Haibatraobuva was laid to rest under the first step of the temple complex per his will.

Despite being a small town, it was granted municipal status during the early British Raj. The council would raise revenue through levying tax on pilgrims which used to number around 50,000 at the end of 19th century.

==Geography==
Alandi () is located on the bank of the Indrayani River, from Khed Taluka of Pune District, near the northern edge of the city of Pune. Alandi has an average elevation of .

==Demographics==
In 2011, Alandi had a population of 28,576. Males constitute 56% of the population and females 44%. The lingua franca is Marathi. Alandi has an average literacy rate of 73% (82% of the males, 68% of females), which is lower than the national average of 74.04%. 13% of the population is under 6 years of age. All castes are represented in the town census. The closely related Maratha clans, Kurhade-Patil and Ghundare-Patil, dominate the civic life of the town.

Traditionally, many Hindu widows have come to reside in places of pilgrimage such as Pandharpur and Alandi.

==Government==
Alandi has a Municipal council with a directly elected as Mayor (Nagaradhyaksha). In the 2016 election to the council, The BJP candidate Vaijayanti Umergekar-Kamble was elected mayor by defeating the Shiv sena candidate, Bhagyashree Randhwe. The BJP holds majority in the 18 member town council.

Alandi comes under the Pune district sub-division of Khed taluka. It is a part of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly constituency of Khed Alandi which in turn belongs to Shirur parliamentary constituency. At present, the assembly seat is held by Nationalist Congress Party&#x27;s Dr. Amol Kolhe.

==Pilgrimage center==
===Dnyaneshwar samadhi===

Alandi is a well known place of pilgrimage for Hindu Marathi people because of the town&#x27;s association with Dnyaneshwar. His devotees believe that he is still alive. A temple complex was built at Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s samadhi and is visited by pilgrims, especially those of the Varkari sect. The Ekadashi of the dark half of each month attracts 60‚Äì70 thousand pilgrims to the town.

===Pandharpur vari===

Every year, the Paduka (symbolic sandals) of Dnyaneshwar go on a 21-day Palkhi from Alandi to reach Pandharpur on Ashadhi Ekadashi (June or July in the Gregorian calendar). The Palkhi procession is joined by hundreds of thousand of Varkari devotees for the 223¬†km journey.

===Kartik Festival===
The biggest festival in Alandi is held every year on &quot;Kartika Vadya Ekadashi&quot; (the eleventh day of the dark fortnight of the Hindu month of Kartik in the Shalivana Shaka calendar). The festival falls close to the day Dnyaneshwar entered Samadhi. This festival or &quot;yatra&quot; is attended by pilgrims and has a significant economic impact for the local population.

===Indrayani river===

Bathing in the Indrayani River has special significance for pilgrims to Alandi. However, the river is heavily polluted because of sewage discharge by towns along its course and contains high amount of &quot;Fecal coliform&quot;.

Being a pilgrim center, the stretch of Indrayani River at Alandi, by tradition, has been designated a sanctuary and no fishing takes place. This acts as a sanctuary for river fish such as the Deccan Mahseer.

Pilgrims perform Parikrama around the town during their visit.

===Other places of religious significance===
The places of interest to pilgrims in and around Alandi include:
* The Dnyaneshwar Samadhi Complex that includes the Samadhi, the Shri Sidheshwar temple and the famed Ajanvriksha tree.
* The ghats on the banks of the Indrayani river. Many people bring ashes of their relatives to be ceremoniously immersed in the river at the ghat.
* Ram Mandir, near the banks of the Indrayani River, south of the Samadhi mandir, is one of the many large temples in Alandi.
* Laxmi Narayan Mandir ‚Äì is located South to Samadhi mandir, adjacent to Ram mandir, near the River ghat.
* The Vitthal-Rukmini Temple.
* Dnyaneshwari Mandir ‚Äì a modern multi story temple of the Govind Maharaj organization. 
* Narsimha Saraswati Math ‚Äì west of Dnyaneshwar Samadhi Complex en route to the Dnyaneshwari Mandir.
* Shree Gajanan Maharaj Temple complex, south of the Dnyaneshwar Samadhi Complex
* Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s Wall ‚Äì according to legend when the Sant Changdev came to visit Dnyaneshwar on a tiger with a snake as a whip, Dnyaneshwar and his siblings went to meet him riding on a wall that moved.
* Sant Jalaram Temple: This temple was built in the 1960s with the same architectural design as the one in Virpur, Gujarat. There is also a temple of Santoshi Mata in the same temple complex.
*The town has a number of Ved Shalas that offer study of the Vedas.

===Nearby places of historical and religious significance===
* Sambhaji Raje Bhosle Memorial: in Tulapur village, approximately 6¬†km from Alandi. A memorial to the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji and the second Chhatrapati of Maratha Empire.
* Dehu: the birth, work and worship place of Sant Tukaram and from where the Sant Tukaram flew to Vaikuntha on eagle.

===Accommodation===
The town has dozens of dharmshalas that provide lodgings to pilgrims from their respective communities such as the Padmashali or Maheshwari. A number of these places also have their own shrines to different deities and Varkari Sants.

==Economy==
===Pilgrim services===
The economy of Alandi was historically based around its status as a place of pilgrimage. Although the major festivals in the town are held only twice a year, pilgrims from all over Maharashtra visit the place throughout the year. The needs of the pilgrims are catered for by groups of Brahmins who officiate at the samadhi, weddings, or religious services to the bereaved. Vendors outside the main temple complex offer goods, such as garlands and turmeric, for worshipping at the samadhi along with religious souvenirs and books. Marathi Hindu castes such as the Padmashali have built Dharmashalas (Pilgrim rest houses) that offer accommodation to pilgrims from their castes. The temple&#x27;s two main festivals occur in Shaka month of Jyeshtha (late June - early July), when the Dnyaneshwar&#x27;s palkhi departs for the Pandharpur Wari, and in the second half of the Shaka month of Kartik (November). During these festivals, a significant percentage of local population earns income by offering accommodation, catering and other services to the pilgrims. However, a significant number residents also have negative feelings about these festivals. The local Municipal council also collects pilgrim or goods tax for public health provision. A report for Pune metropolitan area in 1991 stated that because of religious nature of the place, industry will not be allowed in Alandi.

===Wedding venue===
Alandi is a popular wedding. venue. During the Hindu wedding season, around 300-400 marriages take place daily. The weddings attract about 50-75,000 visitors per year. The numerous dharmashala in the town serve as the venues for the wedding ceremony.

==Public health and the Environment==
As a major pilgrimage center, Alandi receives millions of visitors per annum. However, the town does not have proper underground drainage system. The open storm water drains carry both the storm water and untreated sewerage to the Indrayani river. Studies show that the river is highly polluted at Alandi due to local factors as well as due to activities upstream.

The town also suffers from noise pollution due to the cultural and religious activities. Although the use of loudspeakers is prohibited after 10:00pm in urban areas, temples are exempted. The temple activities start by dawn for various prayers such as Bhajan, and Kirtan and continue until midnight with public address system. The numerous wedding ceremonies also add to noise pollution. A study performed at different locations in the town revealed noise levels exceeding those set by the Central Pollution Control Board (the Indian federal authority addressing pollution related issues).

<text>Hildegarde Loretta Sell, known as Hildegarde (February 1, 1906 ‚Äì July 29, 2005) was an American cabaret singer, who was well known for the song &quot;Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup&quot;.

==Early life==
She was born Hildegarde Loretta Sell in Adell, Wisconsin, and raised in New Holstein, Wisconsin, as a Roman Catholic in a family of German extraction. She trained at Marquette University&#x27;s College of Music in the 1920s.

==Vaudeville and cabaret==
Hildegarde worked in vaudeville and traveling shows throughout her career, appearing across the United States and Europe. She was known for 70 years as The Incomparable Hildegarde, a title bestowed on her by columnist Walter Winchell. She was also nicknamed the First Lady of the Supper Clubs by Eleanor Roosevelt.

She was once referred to as a &quot;luscious, hazel-eyed Milwaukee blonde who sings the way Garbo looks&quot;. During the peak of Hildegarde&#x27;s popularity in the 1930s and 1940s, she was booked in cabarets and supper clubs at least 45 weeks a year. Her recordings sold in the hundreds of thousands, and her admirers ranged from soldiers during World War II to King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden and the Duke of Windsor. On some of her recordings, she was accompanied by band leader Carroll Gibbons. During most of the 1940s she appeared on &quot;Raleigh Room&quot;, an NBC Radio program.

She wore elegant gowns and long gloves: &quot;Miss Piggy stole the gloves idea from me&quot;, she once said. A noted flirt, Hildegarde told risqu√© anecdotes while giving long-stemmed roses to men in the audience. During one performance, she waltzed with a U.S. senator. She is credited with starting a single-name vogue among entertainers. Investments and work in ads for a bottled-water company, barley vitamins and a bathtub device gave her a comfortable income through the rock era.

==Television and stage==
Hildegarde&#x27;s television debut occurred on &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; on September 28, 1954.

She sang a presidential nomination campaign song for Margaret Chase Smith&#x27;s unsuccessful 1964 campaign for president; the song was called &quot;Leave It to the Girls&quot;, and was written by Gladys Shelley.

==Personal life and death==
Hildegarde never married, although she said, &quot;I traveled all my life, met a lot of men, had a lot of romances, but it never worked out. It was always &#x27;hello and goodbye&#x27;&quot;. She was the business partner and good friend of Anna Sosenko, an aspiring songwriter whom she met at a boarding house in Camden, New Jersey, at the beginning of her career. That relationship ended in litigation over the control of receipts from their joint efforts. Her autobiography, &quot;Over 50... So What!&quot;, was published by Doubleday in 1961.

She died at the age of 99 in a Manhattan hospital on July 29, 2005, of natural causes.

<doc id="1230174" wikidata="Q758820" url="?curid=1230174" title="Flow (television)">
<text>In television programming, flow is how channels and networks try to hold their audience from program to program, or from one segment of a program to another. Thus, it is the &quot;flow&quot; of television material from one element to the next. The term is also significant in television studies, the academic analysis of the medium. Media scholar Raymond Williams is responsible for first using the term in this sense. He emphasized that flow is &quot;the defining characteristic of broadcasting, simultaneously as a technology and as a cultural form.&quot; &quot;It is evident that what is now called &#x27;an evening&#x27;s viewing&#x27; is in some ways planned by providers and then by viewers as a whole; that it is in any event planned in discernible sequences which in this sense override particular program units&quot;. Williams argued that ads glued programs together which created the sense of television flow with a shift &quot;from the concept of sequence as &quot;programming&quot; to the concept of &quot;flow&quot;.&quot;

Since the 1990s, the concept of flow has been transformed by new technologies and programming strategies that free the viewer from the old television model. VCRs, DVDs, DVRs (such as TiVo), Video-on-Demand, and online video sources all allow the viewer to construct their own flow. They are no longer limited to a choice of a small number of networks, as they were in the 1950s‚Äì1970s. Consequently, the concept of provider-planned flow is dying out and may not survive beyond the broadcast era of television. 

==Production and purpose==
Williams claims that flow is determined by television&#x27;s &quot;stage of development,&quot; but Rick Altman, Professor of Cinemas and Comparative Literature at the University of Iowa, argues that the culture of the medium produces and determines its flow. He notes that the soundtrack is unique to American culture and is one of the techniques that shapes the viewer&#x27;s flow or his or her experience watching television. He notes that the soundtrack provides the viewer with sufficient plot, cues important events by sound (sound advance, e.g. clapping before it is seen on screen), and creates continuity. These sonic elements create an intermittent flow of television. The goal is not to get the viewers to watch carefully, but to keep them from turning the television off.

<doc id="1230181" wikidata="Q18081" url="?curid=1230181" title="De vulgari eloquentia">
<text>De vulgari eloquentia (, ; &quot;On eloquence in the vernacular&quot;) is the title of a Latin essay by Dante Alighieri. Although meant to consist of four books, it abruptly terminates in the middle of the second book. It was probably composed shortly after Dante went into exile, circa 1302‚Äì1305.

In the first book, Dante discusses the relationship between Latin and the vernacular languages, and the search for an &quot;illustrious&quot; vernacular in the Italian area; the second book is an analysis of the structure of the &quot;canto&quot; or song (also known as &quot;canzuni&quot; in Sicilian), which is a literary genre developed in the Sicilian School of poetry.

Latin essays were very popular in the Middle Ages, but Dante made some innovations in his work: firstly, the subject (writing in vernacular) was an uncommon topic in literary discussion at that time. Also significant was how Dante approached this theme; that is, he presented an argument for giving vernacular the same dignity and legitimacy Latin was typically given. Finally, Dante wrote this essay in order to analyse the origin and the philosophy of the vernacular, because, in his opinion, this language was not something static, but something that evolves and needed a historical contextualisation.

==Structure==
&quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot; is an unfinished project, and so information about its intended structure is limited. Dante interrupted his work at the fourteenth chapter of the second book, and though historians have tried to find a reason for this, it is not known why he so abruptly aborted his essay. At some point, Dante mentions a fourth book in which he planned to deal with the comic genre and the &quot;mediocre&quot; style, and nothing at all is known about the third book. It is thought, however, that the first book was meant to be a sort of preface to the following three books, and so shorter than the others.

==Content==
In the beginning, Dante tackles the historical evolution of language, which he thinks was born unitary and, at a later stage, was separated into different idioms because of the presumptuousness demonstrated by humankind at the time of the building of the Tower of Babel. He compiles a map of the geographical position of the languages he knows, dividing the European territory into three parts: one to the east, with the Greek languages; one to the north, with the Germanic languages, which he believed included Magyar and Slavic languages; one to the south, separated into three Romance languages identified by their word for &#x27;yes&#x27;: oc language (from ), o√Øl language (from ) and s√¨ language (from ). He then discusses &quot;gramatica&quot;, &quot;grammar&quot;, which is a static language consisting of unchanging rules, needed to make up for the natural languages. In chapters ten to fifteen of the first book, Dante writes about his search for the illustrious vernacular, among the fourteen varieties he claims to have found in the Italian region in Book 1 (X,9): &quot;Quare ad minus xiiii vulgaribus sola videtur Ytalia variari.&quot; (&quot;Hence, Italy alone appears to display a variation of at least 14 vulgar languages.&quot;)

In the second book, Dante deals with literary genres, specifying which are the ones that suit the vernacular.

==Models==

Dante took inspiration from rhetorical essays written in Latin, Occitan, Sicilian, and Italian, and from philosophical readings. The main classical rhetorical texts from which he drew information were the &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; by Horace, the &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot; by an anonymous author, and &quot;De Inventione&quot; by Cicero. About the philosophical works, it is important to know that Dante read not only first hand texts, but also summaries that sometimes were not of the original work, but of an intermediary one. The influence and importance of the contribution of the Sicilian language is emphasized by his assertion that &quot;the first hundred and fifty years of Italian poetry was written in Sicilian&quot;. 

The major Occitan work that influenced Dante was probably &quot;Raz√≥s de trobar&quot; by the Catalan troubadour Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun. The &quot;Vers e regles de trobar&quot; is an amplification of Vidal&#x27;s manual, by Jofre de Foix√†. Both works were Occitan manuals of grammar for troubadour poetry. They implicitly and explicitly defended Occitan as the best vernacular for song and verse, prompting Dante to come to the defence of his beloved Tuscan tongue. The popularity of both singing and composing in Occitan by Italians prompted Dante to write: , meaning &quot;To the perpetual shame and lowness of the wicked men of Italy, that praise somebody else&#x27;s vernacular and despise their own, I say...&quot; (&quot;Convivio&quot;, treatise I, XI).

Dante became familiar with Saint Augustine&#x27;s works, the &quot;De Consolatione Philosophiae&quot; by Bo√´thius, Saint Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s works and some encyclopedic dictionaries like the &quot;Etymologiae&quot; by Isidore of Seville and the &quot;Livre du Tresor&quot; by Brunetto Latini. He takes also inspiration from Aristotelian philosophy, and references to texts by representatives of what is sometimes referred to as Radical Aristotelianism can be found in Dante&#x27;s work.

<text>Ivon Anthony Moore-Brabazon, 3rd Baron Brabazon of Tara, (born 20 December 1946), is a British Conservative politician.

==Early life==
Lord Brabazon attended Harrow School. He married Harriet Frances de Courcy Hamilton in 1979, with whom he had a son and a daughter. He has worked in the London Stock Exchange and the freight industry.

==Political career==
===House of Lords===
He sat in the House of Lords as a Conservative and from 1984 to 1986 was a House of Lords whip in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government. He then became a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Transport, holding that post until 1989. Lord Brabazon was then made a Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In early 1990, he returned to the Department of Transport as Minister of State, holding that post until leaving office at the 1992 general election.

===House of Lords Act 1999===
With the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999, Brabazon along with almost all other hereditary peers lost his automatic right to sit in the House of Lords. He was, however, elected as one of the 90 elected hereditary peers to remain in the House of Lords pending completion of House of Lords reform.

In 2001, he was elected Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees, and as a result resigned the Conservative whip and became a non-affiliated member of the House of Lords. This means that he is not associated with any party or with the Crossbenchers. He was the Chairman of Committees from 2002 to 2012, at which point he retook the Conservative whip.

Lord Brabazon is a Deputy Lieutenant of the Isle of Wight.

==Marriage and children==
He married Harriet Frances Hamilton, daughter of Mervyn Peter de Courcy Hamilton, on 8 September 1979. They have one son and one daughter:

* Benjamin Ralph Moore-Brabazon (b. 15 March 1983), read economics at Durham University (2002‚Äì2005); an investment manager with Brewin Dolphin Married to Molly (n√©e Parish)
** Max George Moore-Brabazon (b. 23 March 2015)
** Felix Theodore Reggie Moore-Brabazon (b. 17 May 2017) 
* Anabel Mary Moore-Brabazon (born 1985), in-house solicitor at Burberry

<text>The 1981 Brixton riot, or Brixton uprising, was a series of clashes between mainly black youths and the Metropolitan Police in Brixton, London, between 10 and 12 April 1981. It resulted from racist discrimination against the black community by the mainly white police, especially the police&#x27;s increased use of stop-and-search in the area, and ongoing tensions resulting from the deaths of 13 black teenagers and young adults in the suspicious New Cross house fire that January. The main riot on 11 April, dubbed &quot;Bloody Saturday&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, resulted in 279 injuries to police and 45 injuries to members of the public; over a hundred vehicles were burned, including 56 police vehicles; almost 150 buildings were damaged, thirty of which were burnt out, and many shops were looted. There were 82 arrests. Reports suggested that up to 5,000 people were involved. The Brixton riot was followed by similar riots in July in many other English cities and towns. The Thatcher government commissioned an inquiry, which resulted in the Scarman Report.

==Background==

Brixton in South London was an area with serious social and economic problems.The United Kingdom was affected by a recession by 1981, but the local African-Caribbean community was suffering particularly high unemployment, poor housing, and a higher-than-average crime rate.

In the preceding months there had been growing unease between the police and the inhabitants of Lambeth, the borough of London in which Brixton is located. On 18 January 1981, thirteen black youths died in a fire during a house party in New Cross, in the nearby Borough of Lewisham. Although authorities stated that the fire started inside and was accidental, the public believed it was an arson attack and criticised the police investigation as inadequate. Black activists, including Darcus Howe, organised a march for the &quot;Black People&#x27;s Day of Action&quot; on 2 March. Accounts of turnout vary from 5,000 to 20,000 to 25,000. The marchers walked 17 miles from Deptford to Hyde Park, passing the Houses of Parliament and Fleet Street. While the majority of the march finished in Hyde Park without incident, there was some confrontation with police at Blackfriars. According to Professor Les Back, &quot;while the local press reported the march respectfully, the national papers unloaded the full weight of racial stereotyping.&quot; &quot;The Evening Standard&quot;‚Ä≥s front-page headline had displayed a photo of a policeman with a bloody face juxtaposed with Darcus Howe&#x27;s quote about the march being &quot;A good day&quot;. A few weeks later, the police arrested some of the march organizers and charged them with the offence of riot, but they were later acquitted.

In 1980, the number of crimes recorded in Lambeth borough was 30,805, with 10,626 of those taking place in the Brixton division. Between 1976 and 1980, Brixton accounted for 35% of all crimes in the borough, and 49% of all robbery and violent theft offences. The police recognised the rising crime: at the beginning of April, the Metropolitan Police began &quot;Operation Swamp 81&quot;, a plainclothes operation to reduce crime (named after prime minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s 1978 assertion that the UK &quot;might be rather swamped by people with a different culture&quot;), and uniformed patrols were increased in the area. Officers from other Metropolitan police districts and the Special Patrol Group were dispatched into Brixton, and within five days, 943 people were stopped and searched, with 82 arrested, through the heavy use of what was colloquially known as the &quot;Sus law.&quot; This referred to powers under the Vagrancy Act 1824, which allowed police to search and arrest members of the public when it was believed that they were acting suspiciously, and not necessarily committing a crime. The African-Caribbean community accused the police of disproportionately using these powers against black people.

==10‚Äì11 April== 
Public disfavour came to a head on Friday 10 April. At around 5:15pm a police constable spotted a black youth named Michael Bailey running towards him, apparently away from three other black youths. Bailey was stopped and found to be badly bleeding, but broke away from the constable. Stopped again on Atlantic Road, Bailey was found to have a four-inch stab wound. He ran into a flat and was helped by a family and the police constable there by putting kitchen roll on his wound. A crowd gathered and, as the police then tried to take the wounded boy to a waiting minicab on Railton Road, the crowd tried to intervene thinking the police did not appear to be providing or seeking the medical help Bailey needed quickly enough. As the minicab pulled away at speed a police car arrived and stopped the cab. When an officer from the police car realised Bailey was wounded he moved him into the back of the police car to take him to hospital more quickly, and bound his wound more tightly to stop the bleeding. A group of 50 youths began to shout for Bailey&#x27;s release, thinking the police were arresting him. &quot;Look, they&#x27;re killing him,&quot; claimed one. The crowd descended on the police car and pulled him out.

Rumours spread that a youth had been left to die by the police, or that the police looked on as the stabbed youth was lying on the street. More than 200 youths, black and white with predominantly Afro-Caribbean heritage, reportedly turned on the police. In response, the police decided to increase the number of foot patrols in Railton Road, despite the tensions, and carry on with &quot;Operation Swamp 81&quot; throughout the night and into the following day.

==11‚Äì12 April==

It was believed by the local community that the stabbed youth died as a result of police brutality, fuelling tensions throughout the day as crowds slowly gathered. Tensions first erupted around 4pm, as two police officers stopped and searched a mini cab in Railton Road. By this time Brixton Road (Brixton High Street) was reportedly filled with angry people and police cars were pelted with bricks. At around 5pm the tension escalated and spread, and the 9pm BBC News bulletin that evening reported 46 police officers injured, five seriously. Shops were looted on Railton Road, Mayall Road, Leeson Road, Acre Lane and Brixton Road. The looting in Brixton reportedly started at around 6pm. At 6.15pm the fire brigade received their first call, as a police van was set on fire by rioters in Railton Road, with the fire brigade being warned &quot;riot in progress&quot;. As the fire brigade approached the police cordon, they were waved through without warning, driving down Railton Road towards 300 youths armed with bottles and bricks. The fire brigade met the crowd at the junction between Railton Road and Shakespeare Road and were attacked with stones and bottles.

The police put out emergency calls to police officers across London, asking for assistance. They had no strategy, and only had inadequate helmets and non-fireproof plastic shields to protect themselves with while clearing the streets of rioters. The police reportedly also had difficulties in radio communication. The police proceeded in clearing the Atlantic-Railton-Mayall area by pushing the rioters down the road, forming deep shield walls. The rioters responded with bricks, bottles, and petrol bombs.

At 5.30pm the violence further escalated. Non-rioting members of the public attempted to mediate between the police and the rioters, calling for a de-escalation by withdrawing police out of the area. The destructive efforts of the rioters peaked at around 8pm, as those attempts at mediation failed. Two pubs, 26 businesses, schools and other structures were set alight in the riots.

By 9.30pm, over 1,000 police were dispatched into Brixton, squeezing out the rioters. By 1am on 12 April 1981, the area was largely subdued, with no large groups ‚Äì except the police ‚Äì on the streets. The fire brigade refused to return until the following morning. Police numbers grew to over 2,500, and by the early hours of Sunday morning the rioting had fizzled out.

==Aftermath==
During the disturbances, 299 police were injured, along with at least 65 members of the public. 61 private vehicles and 56 police vehicles were destroyed. 28 premises were burned and another 117 damaged and looted. 82 arrests were made.

Between 3 and 11 July of that year, there was more unrest fuelled by racial and social discord, at Handsworth in Birmingham, Southall in London, Toxteth in Liverpool, Hyson Green in Nottingham and Moss Side in Manchester. There were also smaller pockets of unrest in Leeds, Leicester, Southampton, Halifax, Bedford, Gloucester, Wolverhampton, Coventry, Bristol, and Edinburgh. Racial tension played a major part in most of these disturbances, although all of the riots took place in areas hit particularly hard by unemployment and recession.

===Scarman Report===

The Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, commissioned a public inquiry into the riot headed by Lord Scarman. The Scarman report was published on 25 November 1981.

Scarman found unquestionable evidence of the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of &#x27;stop and search&#x27; powers by the police against black people. As a consequence, a new code for police behaviour was put forward in the &quot;Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984&quot;; and the act also created an independent Police Complaints Authority, established in 1985, to attempt to restore public confidence in the police. Scarman concluded that &quot;complex political, social and economic factors [created a] disposition towards violent protest&quot;.

The 1999 Macpherson Report, an investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the failure of the police to establish sufficient evidence for the prosecution of the charged suspects, found that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report had been ignored. The report concluded that the police force was &quot;institutionally racist&quot;. This report, which did not cover the events of the Brixton Riots, disagreed with the conclusions made by Scarman.

On 25 March 2011, BBC Radio 4 broadcast &quot;The Reunion&quot;, a programme featuring reminiscences by participants, including police and black Brixton residents.

===Other rioting===
On 13 April, Margaret Thatcher dismissed the notion that unemployment and racism lay beneath the Brixton disturbances claiming &quot;Nothing, but nothing, justifies what happened.&quot; Overall unemployment in Brixton stood at 13 percent, with 25.4 percent for ethnic minorities. Unemployment among black youths was estimated at 55 percent. Rejecting increased investment in Britain&#x27;s inner cities, Thatcher added, &quot;Money cannot buy either trust or racial harmony.&quot; Lambeth London Borough Council leader, Ted Knight, complained that the police presence &quot;amounted to an army of occupation&quot; that provoked the riots; Thatcher responded, &quot;What absolute nonsense and what an appalling remark ... No one should condone violence. No one should condone the events ... They were criminal, criminal.&quot;

Small-scale disturbances continued to simmer throughout the summer. After four nights of rioting in Liverpool during the Toxteth riots, beginning 4 July, there were 150 buildings burnt and 781 police officers injured. CS gas was deployed for the first time on the British mainland to quell the rioting. On 10 July, there was fresh rioting in Brixton. It was not until the end of July that the disturbances began to subside.

The recommendations of the Scarman Report to tackle the problems of racial disadvantage and inner-city decline were not implemented. Rioting would break out again in the 1985 and 1995 Brixton riots.

<doc id="1230202" wikidata="Q1483542" url="?curid=1230202" title="Runnymede">
<text>Runnymede is a water-meadow alongside the River Thames in the English county of Surrey, bordering Berkshire and just over west of central London. It is notable for its association with the sealing of Magna Carta, and as a consequence is, with its adjoining hillside, the site of memorials. Runnymede Borough is named after the area, Runnymede being at its northernmost point.

== Topography ==

The name Runnymede refers to land in public and National Trust ownership in the Thames flood plain south-west of the river between Old Windsor and Egham. The area includes (to the west of A308 road) the Long Mede and Runnymede, which together with Coopers Hill Slopes is managed by the National Trust. There is also a narrower strip of land, east of the road and west of the river, known as the Yard Mede. On the west bank of the river, at the southern end of the area shown on the above map, are (inter alia): a recreational area with a large car park; a number of private homes; a large distribution centre; and a hotel.

The landscape of Runnymede is characterised as &quot;Thames Basin Lowland&quot;, an urban fringe. It is a gently undulating vale of small fields interspersed by woods, shaws, ponds, meadows, and heath. The National Trust area is a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI) which contains a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Both sites are overseen by Runnymede Borough Council.

The National Trust holding includes:

* donated in 1929 set behind a narrow riverside park with occasional benches on the southern river bank, with car and coach parking;
* of broadleaved woodland on Coopers Hill Slopes, given in 1963 by the former Egham Urban District Council.

Long Mede is a meadow north of the ancient &quot;mede&quot; (meadow) of Runnymede towards Old Windsor and has been used for centuries to provide good-quality hay from the alluvial pasture. Runnymede itself lies towards Egham. It is likely that Runnymede proper was the site of the sealing of Magna Carta, although the Magna Carta Memorial stands on Long Mede.

The sealing of Magna Carta is also popularly associated with Magna Carta Island, on the opposite (east) bank of the Thames. It has also sometimes been associated with the nearby Ankerwycke Yew. These and their surrounding landscape of floodplain and parkland may once have formed an integral part of Runnymede, as the river has occasionally changed its course here. Ankerwycke and the ruins of the 12th-century Priory of St Mary&#x27;s were both acquired by the National Trust in 1998. As the Thames forms the county boundary at this point, these areas now lie in Berkshire.

== History ==
Runnymede&#x27;s historical significance has been heavily influenced by its proximity to the Roman Road river-crossing at nearby Staines-upon-Thames.

The name Runnymede is believed to derive from the Middle English &quot;runinge&quot; (taking counsel) and &quot;mede&quot; (mead or meadow), describing a place in the meadows used to hold regular meetings. The Witan, Witenagemot or Council of the Anglo-Saxon Kings of the 7th to 11th centuries met from time to time at Runnymede during the reign of Alfred the Great (871‚Äì899). The Council usually assembled in the open air. This political organ transformed in succeeding years, influencing the creation of England&#x27;s 13th-century parliament.

The water-meadow at Runnymede is the most likely location at which, in 1215, King John sealed Magna Carta. The charter itself references Runnymede by name as &quot;Ronimed. inter Windlesoram et Stanes&quot; (between Windsor and Staines). Magna Carta affected common and constitutional law as well as political representation, also affecting the development of parliament.

Runnymede&#x27;s association with ideals of democracy, limitation of power, equality and freedom under law has attracted the placement there of monuments and commemorative symbols.

The last fatal duel in England took place in 1852, on Priest Hill, a continuation of Cooper&#x27;s Hill by Windsor Great Park.

The National Trust land was donated in 1929 by Cara Rogers Broughton and her two sons. The American-born widow of Urban Hanlon Broughton, she was permitted by letter from George V to join her son&#x27;s new peerage in tribute to her husband and this gift and be styled Lady Fairhaven. The gift was given in memory of Urban Broughton. At the time the &quot;New Bedford Standard-Times&quot; commented: &quot;It must be a source of gratification to all Americans, and especially to us here and in Fairhaven, that the presentation of this historic spot as public ground has been brought about by an American woman, an appropriate enough circumstance considering that the great charter underlies the USA&#x27;s conception of government and human rights.&quot;

===Runnymede Eco Village===
Between 2012 and 2015, Cooper&#x27;s Hill was occupied by a radical community living in self-build houses, huts, benders, and tents in the self-proclaimed &quot;Runnymede Eco Village&quot;. Around 40 people, including a few young families, lived in a dispersed settlement throughout the 4 acres of woodland. They used mainly reclaimed material to build living structures, solar power to generate electricity, wood-burners for heat, cultivated some vegetables and kept chickens and geese. Water was obtained from springs on the site, and the village was largely hidden from view from outside the woodland. The members called themselves &quot;Diggers&quot; after the 17th-century Diggers movement.

There were two unsuccessful attempts to evict the settlers in the first year of occupation; and on 30 March 2015 bailiffs served a further High Court trespass notice on behalf of the landowners, Orchard Runnymede Ltd. The settlers were still in occupation during the Magna Carta 800th anniversary celebrations on 15 June, but their presence did not affect proceedings, and the eviction was completed at a later date.

== Features ==
=== Urban H. Broughton memorials ===

After the death of Urban Broughton in 1929, Sir Edwin Lutyens was commissioned to design a set of twin memorials consisting of large kiosks and posts or &quot;piers&quot; with stone blocks crowned with laurel wreaths and formalised urns at the Egham end and with lodges and piers at the Windsor end. Lutyens also designed a low wide arch bridge to carry the main road over the Thames to the north, integrating the road layout and bridge design into his plans for the memorials. The southern kiosks were moved to their present location when the M25 motorway was constructed.

There are two octagonal kiosks with piers facing each other across the A308 towards Egham. These piers are a shorter version of those adjacent to the lodges either side of the same road towards Old Windsor in the Long Mede. The lodges show typical Lutyens design features with steeply angled roofs, large false chimneys and no rainwater gutters at the eaves.

The piers carry similar inscriptions. On one face is the inscription:

and on the other the words:

The memorials were opened in 1932 by Edward VIII and are Grade II listed buildings.

=== Langham Pond SSSI ===
Langham Pond was created when the meandering River Thames formed an oxbow lake. Its status as a wetland Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) was first notified in 1975 and later reviewed under Section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 when the protected area was extended to within Runnymede as managed by the National Trust.

The pond and associated meadow form a habitat considered unique in Southern England and of international importance for nature conservation. The flora and fauna include nationally scarce plants and insects including a species of fly unrecorded elsewhere in the United Kingdom.

=== Air Forces Memorial ===
The Air Forces Memorial commemorates the men and women of the Allied Air Forces who died during the Second World War and records the names of the 20,456 airmen who have no known grave.

From the top of the tower visitors can see long views over Windsor, the surrounding counties and aircraft taking off and landing at Heathrow. On a good day visitors can see as far as the Wembley Arch and even the Gherkin in the City of London. The memorial was designed by Edward Maufe, architect of Guildford Cathedral, with architectural sculptures by Vernon Hill.

=== John F. Kennedy Memorial ===
The British memorial for U.S. President John F. Kennedy was jointly dedicated on 14 May 1965, by Queen Elizabeth II and Jacqueline Kennedy, prior to a reception for the Kennedy family at Windsor Castle. The memorial consists of a garden and Portland stone memorial tablet inscribed with the famous quote from his Inaugural Address:

Visitors reach the memorial by treading a steep path of irregular granite steps, intended to symbolise a pilgrimage. There are 50 steps in total, representing the 50 states in the USA. Each step is different from all others, with the entire flight made from 60,000 hand-cut granite setts. Landscape architect Geoffrey Jellicoe designed the garden; sculptor Alan Collins designed and carved the stone inscription. The area of ground on which the memorial is situated was given as a gift to the United States by the people of the United Kingdom, though the area remains under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. It is maintained by the Kennedy Memorial Trust, which also sponsors educational scholarships for British students to attend university in the United States.

In 1968 the 7-ton stone was damaged by a bomb during a time of anti-Vietnam War demonstrations; it was later repaired by the sculptor.

=== Magna Carta Memorial ===
Situated in a grassed enclosure, on the lower slopes of Cooper&#x27;s Hill, this memorial is of a domed classical style monopteros, containing a pillar of English granite on which is inscribed &quot;To commemorate Magna Carta, symbol of Freedom Under Law&quot;. The memorial was created by the American Bar Association (ABA) after a suggestion by the lawyer and historian Louis Ottenberg. Designed by Sir Edward Maufe R.A., it was unveiled on 18 July 1957 at a ceremony attended by American and English lawyers.

Since 1957 representatives of the ABA have visited and rededicated the Memorial, renewing pledges to the Great Charter. In 1971 and 1985 commemorative stones were placed on the Memorial plinth. In July 2000 the ABA came:

In 2007, on its 50th anniversary, the ABA again visited Runnymede. During its convention it installed as President Charles Rhyne, who devised Law Day, which in the United States represents an annual reaffirmation of faith in the forces of law for peace. Floodlights were installed in 2008 to light the memorial at night.

In 2015, in anticipation of the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta, the two wooden benches at the memorial were replaced by stone benches. On 15 June, the anniversary day, the ABA, accompanied by United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch, rededicated the memorial in a ceremony led by Anne, Princess Royal in the presence of Elizabeth II and other members of the British royal family.

The Magna Carta Memorial is administered by the Magna Carta Trust, which is chaired by the Master of the Rolls.

=== Ceremonial tree plantings ===

Prince Edward, Duke of Kent together with David K. Diebold, a Minister-Counselor at the US Embassy in London, planted an oak tree adjacent to the Magna Carta Memorial in 1987, as did P. V. Narasimha Rao, prime minister of India. The Prime Minister left a plaque reading:

In 1987 two further oak trees were planted near the Memorial. One, planted by Queen Elizabeth II, marked National Tree Week. Another, planted by John O. Marsh Jr., United States Secretary of the Army, has a plaque which reads:

=== &quot;The Jurors&quot; ===


&quot;The Jurors&quot; artwork was commissioned by Surrey County Council and the National Trust to mark the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta. The sculptor Hew Locke created 12 bronze chairs each of which is decorated with symbols of past and present struggles for freedom, equality and the rule of law. The artist invites participants to sit, reflect upon and discuss the themes represented. In the image the back of the chair nearest the viewer is a representation of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s prison cell on Robben Island, South Africa. The portrait seen of the further chair is of Lillie Lenton wearing insignia related to the imprisonment and activism of suffragettes.

The installation was inaugurated at Runnymede by Prince William during the Magna Carta 800th Anniversary celebrations.

=== &quot;Writ in Water&quot; ===

Based on Clause 39 of Magna Carta, and inspired perhaps by the inscription on John Keats&#x27; grave monument, artist Mark Wallinger designed &quot;Writ in Water&quot; to celebrate the legacy of Magna Carta. It combines sky, light and water creating a space for reflection both physically and contemplatively. Architects Studio Octopi installed the art work on Coopers Hill Slopes (accessible from Longmede) and it was unveiled on the 803rd anniversary of the sealing of the Great Charter.

=== Cooper&#x27;s Hill House ===
A large house on Cooper&#x27;s Hill, overlooking Runnymede and the River Thames, has been at different times: the Royal Indian Engineering College; wartime Post Office headquarters; storage during World War II for the statue of Anteros (popularly known as &quot;Eros&quot;) from the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, Picadilly Circus, London; an emergency teacher training college; the Shoreditch College of Education (a centre for craft and handiwork education); and most recently, Brunel University&#x27;s department of design (since relocated to Brunel University&#x27;s campus in Uxbridge).

=== Ankerwycke Yew ===
The 1,400-year-old-plus Ankerwycke Yew, on the left (east) bank of the river, is also a possible site where Magna Carta may have been sealed. The tree could have been the location of the Witan council and influenced the founding of St Mary&#x27;s Priory there. This religious site may well have been the preferred neutral meeting place of King John and the barons.

Land development proposals threatening the yew led to action resulting in the tree and surrounding estate passing into the protection of the National Trust in 1998.

Henry VIII is said to have met Anne Boleyn under the tree in the 1530s.

In 1992, botanist and environmental campaigner David Bellamy led a dedication at the yew, stating:

There followed ten pledges to sustain all life forms.

== Location and access ==
Runnymede is west by south-west of the centre of London. The areas held by the National Trust are open 24 hours and seven days a week at no charge. However, parking times on the medes are restricted and additionally carry a charge for non-National Trust visitors.

Runnymede is accessed via the road or river towpath on foot or by bicycle, or by motor vehicle via the A308 road near Egham about southeast of Windsor. Two car parks (on the A308) adjoin the Windsor entrance (these may be closed in winter due to flooding etc.). The car parks near the Old Windsor entrance are managed by the National Trust: they are free for members, but there is a charge for non-members. The car park at the Runnymede Pleasure Ground further along the A308 at the Egham entrance to the medes is managed by Runnymede Borough Council which imposes a sliding scale of charges. Runnymede lies on the Thames Path National Trail. The nearest railway station is Egham. One of the Lutyens lodges at the Windsor entrance to the meadow houses a popular tea room.

The Anckerwycke area on the other bank of the river is accessible from the B376 between Wraysbury and Staines (nearest station Wraysbury).

<doc id="1230208" wikidata="Q2661942" url="?curid=1230208" title="Harold Thompson (chemist)">
<text>Sir Harold Warris Thompson, CBE, FRS (15 February 1908 ‚Äì 31 December 1983) was an English physical chemist and spectroscopist, who also served as chairman of the Football Association.

==Early life and education==
Harold Thompson was born in Wombwell, Yorkshire, the son of William Thompson, a colliery executive, and Charlotte Emily. He was educated at King Edward VII School in Sheffield, then at Trinity College, Oxford, where he was tutored by Cyril Norman Hinshelwood.

==Chemistry==
Thompson graduated in 1929 and worked with Fritz Haber and Max Planck in Berlin. He returned to Oxford in 1930 after receiving a Ph.D. from the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin. He was a Fellow and later Vice-President of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford.

His research interests included chemical reactions in gases, photochemistry and spectroscopy. During the Second World War he worked on infra-red spectroscopy for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, and afterwards continued research in this field.

Thompson was described as an inspiring teacher. His students at Oxford included Margaret Thatcher, whom he taught when she was a chemistry student.

==Football Association==
Thompson was an avid football player, earning a blue in his final year at Oxford. He was involved with Oxford University Association Football Club for most of his life, helping to establish the Varsity match at Wembley. He established the Pegasus Club in 1948. He was chairman of the Football Association (1976‚Äì1981). One former FA official said of him, &quot;Sir Harold was a bullying autocrat. He was a bastard. He treated the staff like shit&quot;.

Thompson played a major role in the sacking of World Cup-winning England manager Sir Alf Ramsey in 1974. Given England&#x27;s failure to qualify for the World Cup that year, Ramsey&#x27;s dismissal may have been justified, but the newspapers reported that &quot;the whole episode was handled with brutal insensitivity.&quot;

British journalist and author Leo McKinstry wrote that &quot;England&#x27;s most successful manager would have had a legacy fit for a hero had it not been for the malevolence of the FA chief Harold Thompson.&quot;

Thompson subsequently unfairly ensured that one of the most successful club managers of the time, Brian Clough, never became England manager.

==Honours==
Thompson received many honours, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1946. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1959 New Year Honours and knighted in the 1968 New Year Honours. Thompson was also made a Chevalier of the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur in 1971.

In 1981, Thompson became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.

Thompson co-edited the journal Spectrochimica Acta Part A for 30 years. In 1985, the journal dedicated the entirety of Volume 41 to Thompson&#x27;s memory. The volume included articles by many of his students, colleagues and admirers and also included special reminiscences from prominent colleagues, including Richard C. Lord and Foil A. Miller.

In 1986, Spectrochimica Acta Part A established the &quot;Sir Harold Thompson Memorial Award,&quot; awarded annually to the authors of the article representing &quot;the most significant advance reported during the preceding year.&quot;

==Personal life==
Thompson married Grace Penelope Stradling in 1938 and they had two children. 
He died on 31 December 1983.

<text>These Old Shades is a 1926 historical romance written by British novelist Georgette Heyer. The novel is set around 1755: Heyer refers to the Duke of Avon&#x27;s participation in the 1745 uprising as ten years previous; in addition the Prince of Cond√© is said to be about 20 years old. However, she also refers to Madame de Pompadour as actively involved with Louis XV, whereas her relationship with the King ended at about 1750.

==Plot summary==
Fortune favours Justin Alastair, the notorious Duke of Avon, casting in his way, one Paris night, the means to revenge himself on his enemy, the Comte de Saint-Vire. Avon literally collides with an abused boy, L√©on Bonnard, whose red hair, deep blue eyes and black eyebrows proclaim him a child of the Comte.

Not knowing the exact relationship between the boy and Saint-Vire, Avon purchases him from his brother, a tavern keeper. He takes the boy as his page, and as such can parade the boy throughout French high society, even at a party at Versailles held by Louis XV. The Duke displays L√©on before the Comte&#x27;s wife and his son and heir. He notes the resemblance of the son, Henri, to L√©on&#x27;s brother, Jean Bonnard, a tavern keeper. He also notes that the boy, L√©on&#x27;s age, prefers rural life, and wants to be a farmer. After this excursion to Versailles, the Comte becomes greatly interested in L√©on and attempts to purchase him. Meanwhile, both Avon and his friend, Hugh Davenant, have realised that L√©on is actually a girl, L√©onie. L√©onie is wildly devoted to Avon, seeing him as her saviour from a life of abuse, rather than as dissolute and scandalous, as the rest of the fashionable world views him.

The Duke journeys into Champagne, where L√©onie grew up, to meet a childhood mentor, the village priest who educated her. This discussion confirms for Avon what he had suspected: L√©onie is the legitimate child of the Comte and his wife and was switched at birth with the Bonnard&#x27;s newborn son, who has been raised as the Comte&#x27;s heir ever since, as the Comte feared his wife would not bear any other children and he was eager to prevent his younger brother Armand from becoming his heir.

The dissipated Avon has come to care for L√©onie so while he continues his scheme of revenge on the Comte, he takes L√©onie to England with him where he announces his intention to make her his ward. He teaches her to be a lady, while letting her be known as L√©onie de Bonnard. The Comte has become increasingly desperate and kidnaps her and carries her to France. L√©onie escapes from him with the help of the Duke&#x27;s younger brother, Lord Rupert. The party is then joined by Fanny Marling, the Duke&#x27;s sister, and her husband, Edward Marling.

Once in France, the Duke introduces L√©onie into Parisian society, where she makes a big splash. A rumour comes to L√©onie&#x27;s ears that she is the Comte&#x27;s illegitimate child‚Äîthe family likeness is very striking. The Comte then persuades L√©onie that her illegitimacy is destroying the Duke&#x27;s reputation, as society views her as his lover. Her distress at this leads her to flee to live with the kindly village priest of her childhood.

This event spurs Avon to complete his revenge. At a large party, he tells the true story of L√©onie&#x27;s life, then embellishes it by adding that she has drowned herself in the Seine. This breaks her mother, whose open grief betrays the Comte&#x27;s guilt. Knowing he is ruined in society, the Comte shoots himself. His despised brother becomes the new Comte.

Avon reunites with L√©onie, they express their true feelings, and they marry.

==Sequels==
The novel&#x27;s title is taken from Austin Dobson&#x27;s epilogue poem to his collection of essays &quot;Eighteenth Century Vignettes&quot;.
&quot;Devil&#x27;s Cub&quot; (1932) follows &quot;These Old Shades&quot; with the adventures of Avon&#x27;s and L√©onie&#x27;s son Dominic, a shockingly selfish and indulged young man who elopes with a poor relation of one of his father&#x27;s friends. &quot;An Infamous Army&quot; (1937) completes the family saga with the Duke of Avon&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Barbara, marrying the hero of &quot;An Infamous Army&quot;. It is also a sequel to &quot;Regency Buck&quot; (1935).

&quot;These Old Shades&quot; was itself originally intended to be a sequel to Heyer&#x27;s first novel &quot;The Black Moth&quot; (1921), which would redeem the devilish Belmanoir. But as &quot;The Black Moth&quot; was a melodrama and a sequel per se would not work in with the plot, she decided to make the new novel stand alone, renamed many characters and made them &#x27;shades&#x27; of their former selves.

==Precedent==
After &quot;These Old Shades&quot; became popular despite its release during the 1926 United Kingdom general strike, Heyer determined that publicity was not necessary for good sales, thenceforth refusing to grant interviews. As she told a friend: &quot;My private life concerns no one but myself and my family.&quot;

<text>The Southern Railway (SR) in the UK gave the designation SL to the fleet of AC &quot;overhead&quot; electric multiple units used on the South London Line between Victoria and London Bridge station. These had been built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1909, but with the abandonment of the &quot;Elevated Electric&quot; service in 1928 they were converted to DC third rail units.

==Construction==
The SL (South London stock) units were built in 1909 for use on the LBSCR AC overhead electrified lines in South London. This stock comprised eight three-car units, originally formed Driving Motor Brake Third + Trailer First + Driving Motor Brake Third. They were built by the Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage &amp; Wagon Company at Birmingham and each motor coach had four Winter Eichberg motors.

The Trailer First cars were later removed and used as locomotive-hauled stock, from when the driving cars were paired with former loco-hauled coaches converted to Driving Trailer Composite cars.

After the replacement of the AC overhead equipment by the standard SR 660 V DC third-rail system on 17 June 1928, these units were rebuilt. The Driving Motor cars were paired together again to form eight units designated 2SL. The Trailer First cars (which had been out of EMU stock for nearly twenty years) were included in this programme, and were rebuilt into Driving Motor and Driving Trailer pairs to form four units designated 2Wim, for use on the Wimbledon-West Croydon line.

==Formations==
The LB&amp;SCR purchased sufficient cars for 8 permanent sets, numbered 1E to 8E. However, later Brighton practice was to dispense with fixed sets.
When the units were reformed into 2-car sets, 14 driving trailers were provided for 16 driving motor cars, because it was found that the motor cars required more time under maintenance.

<text>The art of the United Kingdom refers to all forms of visual art in or associated with the country since the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 and encompasses English art, Scottish art, Welsh art and Irish art, and forms part of Western art history. During the 18th century, Britain began to reclaim the leading place England had previously played in European art during the Middle Ages, being especially strong in portraiture and landscape art.

Increased British prosperity at the time led to a greatly increased production of both fine art and the decorative arts, the latter often being exported. The Romantic period resulted from very diverse talents, including the painters William Blake, J. M. W. Turner, John Constable and Samuel Palmer. The Victorian period saw a great diversity of art, and a far bigger quantity created than before. Much Victorian art is now out of critical favour, with interest concentrated on the Pre-Raphaelites and the innovative movements at the end of the 18th century.

The training of artists, which had long been neglected, began to improve in the 18th century through private and government initiatives, and greatly expanded in the 19th century. Public exhibitions and the later opening of museums brought art to a wider public, especially in London. In the 19th century publicly displayed religious art once again became popular after a virtual absence since the Reformation, and, as in other countries, movements such as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the Glasgow School contended with established Academic art.

The British contribution to early Modernist art was relatively small, but since World War II British artists have made a considerable impact on Contemporary art, especially with figurative work, and Britain remains a key centre of an increasingly globalized art world.

==Background==

The oldest surviving British art includes Stonehenge from around 2600 BC, and tin and gold works of art produced by the Beaker people from around 2150 BC. The La T√®ne style of Celtic art reached the British Isles rather late, no earlier than about 400 BC, and developed a particular &quot;Insular Celtic&quot; style seen in objects such as the Battersea Shield, and a number of bronze mirror-backs decorated with intricate patterns of curves, spirals and trumpet-shapes. Only in the British Isles can Celtic decorative style be seen to have survived throughout the Roman period, as shown in objects like the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan and the resurgence of Celtic motifs, now blended with Germanic interlace and Mediterranean elements, in Christian Insular art. This had a brief but spectacular flowering in all the countries that now form the United Kingdom in the 7th and 8th centuries, in works such as the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne. The Insular style was influential across Northern Europe, and especially so in later Anglo-Saxon art, although this received new Continental influences.

The English contribution to Romanesque art and Gothic art was considerable, especially in illuminated manuscripts and monumental sculpture for churches, though the other countries were now essentially provincial, and in the 15th century Britain struggled to keep up with developments in painting on the Continent. A few examples of top-quality English painting on walls or panel from before 1500 have survived, including the Westminster Retable, The Wilton Diptych and some survivals from paintings in Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster.

The Protestant Reformations of England and Scotland were especially destructive of existing religious art, and the production of new work virtually ceased. The Artists of the Tudor Court were mostly imported from Europe, setting a pattern that would continue until the 18th century. The portraiture of Elizabeth I ignored contemporary European Renaissance models to create iconic images that border on naive art. The portraitists Hans Holbein and Anthony van Dyck were the most distinguished and influential of a large number of artists who spent extended periods in Britain, generally eclipsing local talents like Nicolas Hilliard, the painter of portrait miniatures, Robert Peake the elder, William Larkin, William Dobson, and John Michael Wright, a Scot who mostly worked in London.

Landscape painting was as yet little developed in Britain at the time of the Union, but a tradition of marine art had been established by the father and son both called Willem van de Velde, who had been the leading Dutch maritime painters until they moved to London in 1673, in the middle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

==Early 18th century==

The so-called Acts of Union 1707 came in the middle of the long period of domination in London of Sir Godfrey Kneller, a German portraitist who had eventually succeeded as principal court painter the Dutch Sir Peter Lely, whose style he had adopted for his enormous and formulaic output, of greatly varying quality, which was itself repeated by an army of lesser painters. His counterpart in Edinburgh, Sir John Baptist Medina, born in Brussels to Spanish parents, had died just before the Union took place, and was one of the last batch of Scottish knights to be created. Medina had first worked in London, but in mid-career moved to the less competitive environment of Edinburgh, where he dominated portraiture of the Scottish elite. However, after the Union the movement was to be all in the other direction, and Scottish aristocrats resigned themselves to paying more to have their portraits painted in London, even if by Scottish painters such as Medina&#x27;s pupil William Aikman, who moved down in 1723, or Allan Ramsay.

There was an alternative, more direct, tradition in British portraiture to that of Lely and Kneller, tracing back to William Dobson and the German or Dutch Gerard Soest, who trained John Riley, to whom only a few works are firmly attributed and who in turn trained Jonathan Richardson, a fine artist who trained Thomas Hudson who trained Joshua Reynolds and Joseph Wright of Derby. Richardson also trained the most notable Irish portraitist of the period, Charles Jervas who enjoyed social and financial success in London despite his clear limitations as an artist.

An exception to the dominance of the &quot;lower genres&quot; of painting was Sir James Thornhill (1675/76‚Äì1734) who was the first and last significant English painter of huge Baroque allegorical decorative schemes, and the first native painter to be knighted. His best-known work is at Greenwich Hospital, Blenheim Palace and the cupola of Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. His drawings show a taste for strongly drawn realism in the direction his son-in-law William Hogarth was to pursue, but this is largely overridden in the finished works, and for Greenwich he took to heart his careful list of &quot;Objections that will arise from the plain representation of the King&#x27;s landing as it was in fact and in the modern way and dress&quot; and painted a conventional Baroque glorification. Like Hogarth, he played the nationalist card in promoting himself, and eventually beat Sebastiano Ricci to enough commissions that in 1716 he and his team retreated to France, Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini having already left in 1713. Once the other leading foreign painters of allegoric schemes, Antonio Verrio and Louis Laguerre, had died in 1707 and 1721 respectively, Thornhill had the field to himself, although by the end of his life commissions for grand schemes had dried up from changes in taste.

From 1714 the new Hanoverian dynasty conducted a far less ostentatious court, and largely withdrew from patronage of the arts, other than the necessary portraits. Fortunately, the booming British economy was able to supply aristocratic and mercantile wealth to replace the court, above all in London.
William Hogarth was a great presence in the second quarter of the century, whose art was successful in achieving a particular English character, with vividly moralistic scenes of contemporary life, full of both satire and pathos, attuned to the tastes and prejudices of the Protestant middle-class, who bought the engraved versions of his paintings in huge numbers. Other subjects were only issued as prints, and Hogarth was both the first significant British printmaker, and still the best known. Many works were series of four or more scenes, of which the best known are: &quot;A Harlot&#x27;s Progress&quot; and &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; from the 1730s and &quot;Marriage √†-la-mode&quot; from the mid-1740s. In fact, although he only once briefly left England and his own propaganda asserted his Englishness and often attacked the Old Masters, his background in printmaking, more closely aware of Continental art than most British painting, and apparently his ability to quickly absorb lessons from other painters, meant that he was more aware of, and made more use of, Continental art than most of his contemporaries.

Like many later painters Hogarth wanted above all to achieve success at history painting in the Grand Manner, but his few attempts were not successful and are now little regarded. His portraits were mostly of middle-class sitters shown with an apparent realism that reflected both sympathy and flattery, and included some in the fashionable form of the conversation piece, recently introduced from France by Philippe Mercier, which was to remain a favourite in Britain, taken up by artists such as Francis Hayman, though usually abandoned once an artist could get good single figure commissions.
There was a recognition that, even more than the rest of Europe given the lack of British artists, the training of artists needed to be extended beyond the workshop of established masters, and various attempts were made to set up academies, starting with Kneller in 1711, with the help of Pellegrini, in Great Queen Street. The academy was taken over by Thornhill in 1716, but seems to have become inactive by the time John Vanderbank and Louis Ch√©ron set up their own academy in 1720. This did not last long, and in 1724/5 Thornhill tried again in his own house, with little success. Hogarth inherited the equipment for this, and used it to start the St. Martin&#x27;s Lane Academy in 1735, which was the most enduring, eventually being absorbed by the Royal Academy in 1768. Hogarth also helped solve the problem of a lack of exhibition venues in London, arranging for shows at the Foundling Hospital from 1746.

The Scottish portraitist Allan Ramsay worked in Edinburgh before moving to London by 1739. He made visits of three years to Italy at the beginning and end of his career, and anticipated Joshua Reynolds in bringing a more relaxed version of &quot;Grand Manner&quot; to British portraiture, combined with very sensitive handling in his best work, which is generally agreed to have been of female sitters. His main London rival in the mid-century, until Reynolds made his reputation, was Reynold&#x27;s master, the stodgy Thomas Hudson.

John Wootton, active from about 1714 to his death in 1765, was the leading sporting painter of his day, based in the capital of English horse racing at Newmarket, and producing large numbers of portraits of horses and also battle scenes and conversation pieces with a hunting or riding setting. He had begun life as a page to the family of the Dukes of Beaufort, who in the 1720s sent him to Rome, where he acquired a classicising landscape style based on that of Gaspard Dughet and Claude, which he used in some pure landscape paintings, as well as views of country houses and equine subjects. This introduced an alternative to the various Dutch and Flemish artists who had previously set the prevailing landscape style in Britain, and through intermediary artists such as George Lambert, the first British painter to base a career on landscape subjects, was to greatly influence other British artists such as Gainsborough. Samuel Scott was the best of the native marine and townscape artists, though in the latter specialization he could not match the visiting Canaletto, who was in England from nine years from 1746, and whose Venetian views were a favourite souvenir of the Grand Tour.

The antiquary and engraver George Vertue was a figure in the London art scene for most of the period, and his copious notebooks were adapted and published in the 1760s by Horace Walpole as &quot;Some Anecdotes of Painting in England&quot;, which remains a principal source for the period.

From his arrival in London in 1720, the Flemish sculptor John Michael Rysbrack was the leader in his field until the arrival in 1730 of Louis-Fran√ßois Roubiliac who had a Rococo style which was highly effective in busts and small figures, though by the following decade he was also commissioned for larger works. He also produced models for the Chelsea porcelain factory founded in 1743, a private enterprise which sought to compete with Continental factories mostly established by rulers. Roubiliac&#x27;s style formed that of the leading native sculptor Sir Henry Cheere, and his brother John who specialized in statues for gardens.

The strong London silversmithing trade was dominated by the descendants of Huguenot refugees like Paul de Lamerie, Paul Crespin, Nicholas Sprimont, and the Courtauld family, as well as Georges Wickes. Orders were received from as far away as the courts of Russia and Portugal, though English styles were still led by Paris. The manufacture of silk at Spitalfields in London was also a traditional Huguenot business, but from the late 1720s silk design was dominated by the surprising figure of Anna Maria Garthwaite, a parson&#x27;s daughter from Lincolnshire who emerged at the age of 40 as a designer of largely floral patterns in Rococo styles.

Unlike in France and Germany, the English adoption of the Rococo style was patchy rather than whole-hearted, and there was resistance to it on nationalist grounds, led by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington and William Kent, who promoted styles in interior design and furniture to match the Palladianism of the architecture they produced together, also beginning the influential British tradition of the landscape garden, according to Nikolaus Pevsner &quot;the most influential of all English innovations in art&quot;. The French-born engraver Hubert-Fran√ßois Gravelot, in London from 1732 to 1745, was a key figure in importing Rococo taste in book illustrations and ornament prints for craftsmen to follow.

==Late 18th century==
In the modern popular mind, English art from about 1750‚Äì1790 ‚Äî today referred to as the &quot;classical age&quot; of English painting ‚Äî was dominated by Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723‚Äì1792), George Stubbs (1724‚Äì1806), Thomas Gainsborough (1727‚Äì1788) and Joseph Wright of Derby (1734‚Äì1797). At the time Reynolds was considered the dominant figure, Gainsborough was very highly reputed, but Stubbs was seen as a mere painter of animals and viewed as far a less significant figure than many other painters that are today little-known or forgotten. The period saw continued rising prosperity for Britain and British artists: &quot;By the 1780s English painters were among the wealthiest men in the country, their names familiar to newspaper readers, their quarrels and cabals the talk of the town, their subjects known to everyone from the displays in the print-shop windows&quot;, according to Gerald Reitlinger.

Reynolds returned from a long visit to Italy in 1753, and very quickly established a reputation as the most fashionable London portraitist, and before long as a formidable figure in society;, the public leader of the arts in Britain. He had studied both classical and modern Italian art, and his compositions discreetly re-use models seen on his travels. He could convey a wide range of moods and emotions, whether heroic military men or very young women, and often to unite background and figure in a dramatic way.

The Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce had been founded in 1754, principally to provide a location for exhibitions. In 1761 Reynolds was a leader in founding the rival Society of Artists of Great Britain, where the artists had more control. This continued until 1791, despite the founding of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1768, which immediately became both the most important exhibiting organization and the most important school in London. Reynolds was its first President, holding the office until his death in 1792. His published &quot;Discourses&quot;, first delivered to the students, were regarded as the first major writing on art in English, and set out the aspiration for a style to match the classical grandeur of classical sculpture and High Renaissance painting.

After the academy was established, Reynolds&#x27; portraits became more overly classicizing, and often more distant, until in the late 1770s he returned to a more intimate style, perhaps influenced by the success of Thomas Gainsborough, who only settled in London in 1773, after working in Ipswich and then Bath. While Reynolds&#x27; practice of aristocratic portraits seem exactly matched to his talents, Gainsborough, if not forced to follow the market for his work, might well have developed as a pure landscape painter, or a portraitist in the informal style of many of his portraits of his family. He continued to paint pure landscapes, largely for pleasure until his later years; full recognition of his landscapes came only in the 20th century. His main influences were French in his portraits and Dutch in his landscapes, rather than Italian, and he is famous for the brilliant light touch of his brushwork. 

George Romney also became prominent in about 1770 and was active until 1799, though with a falling-off in his last years. His portraits are mostly characterful but flattering images of dignified society figures, but he developed an obsession with the flighty young Emma Hamilton from 1781, painting her about sixty times in more extravagant poses. His work was especially sought-after by American collectors in the early 20th century and many are now in American museums. By the end of the period this generation had been succeeded by younger portraitists including John Hoppner, Sir William Beechey and the young Gilbert Stuart, who only realized his mature style after he returned to America.

The Welsh painter Richard Wilson returned to London from seven years in Italy in 1757, and over the next two decades developed a &quot;sublime&quot; landscape style adapting the Franco-Italian tradition of Claude and Gaspard Dughet to British subjects. Though much admired, like those of Gainsborough his landscapes were hard to sell, and he sometimes resorted, as Reynolds complained, to the common stratagem of turning them into history paintings by adding a few small figures, which doubled their price to about ¬£80. He continued to paint scenes set in Italy, as well as England and Wales, and his death in 1782 came just as large numbers of artists began to travel to Wales, and later the Lake District and Scotland in search of mountainous views, both for oil paintings and watercolours which were now starting their long period of popularity in Britain, both with professionals and amateurs. Paul Sandby, Francis Towne, John Warwick Smith, and John Robert Cozens were among the leading specialist painters and the clergyman and amateur artist William Gilpin was an important writer who stimulated the popularity of amateur painting of the picturesque, while the works of Alexander Cozens recommended forming random ink blots into landscape compositions‚Äîeven Constable tried this technique.
History painting in the grand manner continued to be the most prestigious form of art, though not the easiest to sell, and Reynolds made several attempts at it, as unsuccessful as Hogarth&#x27;s. The unheroic nature of modern dress was seen as a major obstacle in the depiction of contemporary scenes, and the Scottish gentleman-artist and art dealer Gavin Hamilton preferred classical scenes as well as painting some based on his Eastern travels, where his European figures by-passed the problem by wearing Arab dress. He spent most of his adult life based in Rome and had at least as much influence on Neo-Classicism in Europe as in Britain. The Irishman James Barry was an influence on Blake but had a difficult career, and spent years on his cycle &quot;The Progress of Human Culture&quot; in the Great Room of the Royal Society of Arts. The most successful history painters, who were not afraid of buttons and wigs, were both Americans settled in London: Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley, though one of his most successful works &quot;Watson and the Shark&quot; (1778) was able to mostly avoid them, showing a rescue from drowning. 

Smaller scale subjects from literature were also popular, pioneered by Francis Hayman, one of the first to paint scenes from Shakespeare, and Joseph Highmore, with a series illustrating the novel &quot;Pamela&quot;. At the end of the period the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery was an ambitious project for paintings, and prints after them, illustrating &quot;the Bard&quot;, as he had now become, while exposing the limitations of contemporary English history painting. Joseph Wright of Derby was mainly a portrait painter who also was one of the first artists to depict the Industrial Revolution, as well as developing a cross between the conversation piece and history painting in works like &quot;An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump&quot; (1768) and &quot;A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery&quot; (c. 1766), which like many of his works are lit only by candlelight, giving a strong chiaroscuro effect.
Paintings recording scenes from the theatre were another subgenre, painted by the German Johann Zoffany among others. Zoffany painted portraits and conversation pieces, who also spent over two years in India, painting the English nabobs and local scenes, and the expanding British Empire played an increasing role in British art. Training in art was considered a useful skill in the military for sketch maps and plans, and many British officers made the first Western images, often in watercolour, of scenes and places around the world. In India, the Company style developed as a hybrid form between Western and Indian art, produced by Indians for a British market.
Thomas Rowlandson produced watercolours and prints satirizing British life, but mostly avoided politics. The master of the political caricature, sold individually by print shops (often acting as publishers also), either hand-coloured or plain, was James Gillray. The emphasis on portrait-painting in British art was not entirely due to the vanity of the sitters. There was a large collector&#x27;s market for portrait prints, mostly reproductions of paintings, which were often mounted in albums. From the mid-century there was a great growth in the expensive but more effective reproductions in mezzotint, of portraits and other paintings, with special demand from collectors for early proof states &quot;before letter&quot; (that is, before the inscriptions were added), which the printmakers obligingly printed off in growing numbers.

This period marked one of the high points in British decorative arts. Around the mid-century many porcelain factories opened, including Bow in London, and in the provinces Lowestoft, Worcester, Royal Crown Derby, Liverpool, and Wedgwood, with Spode following in 1767. Most were started as small concerns, with some lasting only a few decades while others still survive today. By the end of the period British porcelain services were being commissioned by foreign royalty and the British manufacturers were especially adept at pursuing the rapidly expanding international middle-class market, developing bone china and transfer-printed wares as well as hand-painted true porcelain.

The three leading furniture makers, Thomas Chippendale (1718‚Äì1779), Thomas Sheraton (1751‚Äì1806) and George Hepplewhite (1727?‚Äì1786) had varied styles and have achieved the lasting fame they have mainly as the authors of pattern books used by other makers in Britain and abroad. In fact it is far from clear if the last two named ever ran actual workshops, though Chippendale certainly was successful in this and in what we now call interior design; unlike France Britain had abandoned its guild system, and Chippendale was able to employ specialists in all the crafts needed to complete a redecoration. During the period Rococo and Chinoiserie gave way to Neo-Classicism, with the Scottish architect and interior designer Robert Adam (1728‚Äì1792) leading the new style.

==19th century and the Romantics==

The late 18th century and the early 19th century characterized by the Romantic movement in British art includes Joseph Wright of Derby, James Ward, Samuel Palmer, Richard Parkes Bonington, John Martin and was perhaps the most radical period in British art, also producing William Blake (1757‚Äì1827), John Constable (1776‚Äì1837) and J. M. W. Turner (1775‚Äì1851), the later two being arguably the most internationally influential of all British artists. Turner&#x27;s style, based on the Italianate tradition although he never saw Italy until in his forties, passed through considerable changes before his final wild, almost abstract, landscapes that explored the effects of light, and were a profound influence on the Impressionists and other later movements. Constable normally painted pure landscapes with at most a few genre figures, in a style based on Northern European traditions, but, like Turner, his &quot;six-footers&quot; were intended to make as striking an impact as any history painting. They were carefully prepared using studies and full-size oil sketches, whereas Turner was notorious for finishing his exhibition pieces when they were already hanging for show, freely adjusting them to dominate the surrounding works in the tightly packed hangs of the day.

Blake&#x27;s visionary style was a minority taste in his lifetime, but influenced the younger group of &quot;Ancients&quot; of Samuel Palmer, John Linnell, Edward Calvert and George Richmond, who gathered in the country at Shoreham, Kent in the 1820s, producing intense and lyrical pastoral idylls in conditions of some poverty. They went on to more conventional artistic careers and Palmer&#x27;s early work was entirely forgotten until the early 20th century. Blake and Palmer became a significant influence on modernist artists of the 20th century seen (among others) in the painting of British artists such as Dora Carrington, Paul Nash and Graham Sutherland. Blake also had an enormous influence on the beat poets of the 1950s and the counterculture of the 1960s.

Thomas Lawrence was already a leading portraitist by the start of the 20th century, and able to give a Romantic dash to his portraits of high society, and the leaders of Europe gathered at the Congress of Vienna after the Napoleonic Wars. Henry Raeburn was the most significant portraitist since the Union to remain based in Edinburgh throughout his career, an indication of increasing Scottish prosperity. But David Wilkie took the traditional road south, achieving great success with subjects of country life and hybrid genre and history scenes such as &quot;The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch&quot; (1822).

John Flaxman was the most thorough-going neo-classical English artist. Beginning as a sculptor, he became best known for his many spare &quot;outline drawings&quot; of classical scenes, often illustrating literature, which were reproduced as prints. These imitated the effects of the classical-style reliefs he also produced. The German-Swiss Henry Fuseli also produced work in a linear graphic style, but his narrative scenes, often from English literature, were intensely Romantic and highly dramatic.

==Victorian art==
The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (PRB) achieved considerable influence after its foundation in 1848 with paintings that concentrated on religious, literary, and genre subjects executed in a colourful and minutely detailed style, rejecting the loose painterly brushwork of the tradition represented by &quot;Sir Sloshua&quot; Reynolds. PRB artists included John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Ford Madox Brown (never officially a member), and figures such as Edward Burne-Jones and John William Waterhouse were later much influenced by aspects of their ideas, as was the designer William Morris. Morris advocated a return to hand-craftsmanship in the decorative arts over the industrial manufacture that was rapidly being applied to all crafts. His efforts to make beautiful objects affordable (or even free) for everyone led to his wallpaper and tile designs defining the Victorian aesthetic and instigating the Arts and Crafts movement.

The Pre-Raphaelites, like Turner, were supported by the authoritative art critic John Ruskin, himself a fine amateur artist. For all their technical innovation, they were both traditional and Victorian in their adherence to the history painting as the highest form of art, and their subject matter was thoroughly in tune with Victorian taste, and indeed &quot;everything that the publishers of steel engravings welcomed&quot;, enabling them to merge easily into the mainstream in their later careers.

While the Pre-Raphaelites had a turbulent and divided reception, the most popular and expensive painters of the period included Edwin Landseer, who specialized in sentimental animal subjects, which were favourites of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. In the later part of the century artists could earn large sums from selling the reproduction rights of their paintings to print publishers, and works of Landseer, especially his &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; (1851), a portrait of a Highland stag, were among the most popular. Like Millais&#x27; &quot;Bubbles&quot; (1886) it was used on packaging and advertisements for decades, for brands of whisky and soap respectively.

During the late Victorian era in Britain the academic paintings, some enormously large, of Lord Leighton and the Dutch-born Lawrence Alma-Tadema were enormously popular, both often featuring lightly clad beauties in exotic or classical settings, while the allegorical works of G. F. Watts matched the Victorian sense of high purpose. The classical ladies of Edward Poynter and Albert Moore wore more clothes and met with rather less success. William Powell Frith painted highly detailed scenes of social life, typically including all classes of society, that include comic and moral elements and have an acknowledged debt to Hogarth, though tellingly different from his work.

For all such artists the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition was an essential platform, reviewed at huge length in the press, which often alternated ridicule and extravagant praise in discussing works. The ultimate, and very rare, accolade was when a rail had to be put in front of a painting to protect it from the eager crowd; up to 1874 this had only happened to Wilkie&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Pensioners&quot;, Frith&#x27;s &quot;The Derby Day&quot; and &quot;Salon d&#x27;Or, Homburg&quot; and Luke Filde&#x27;s &quot;The Casual Ward&quot; (see below). A great number of artists laboured year after year in the hope of a hit there, often working in manners to which their talent was not really suited, a trope exemplified by the suicide in 1846 of Benjamin Haydon, a friend of Keats and Dickens and a better writer than painter, leaving his blood splashed over his unfinished &quot;King Alfred and the First British Jury&quot;.
British history was a very common subject, with the Middle Ages, Elizabeth I, Mary, Queen of Scots and the English Civil War especially popular sources for subjects. Many painters mentioned elsewhere painted historical subjects, including Millais (&quot;The Boyhood of Raleigh&quot; and many others), Ford Madox Brown (&quot;Cromwell on his Farm&quot;), David Wilkie, Watts and Frith, and West, Bonington and Turner in earlier decades. The London-based Irishman Daniel Maclise and Charles West Cope painted scenes for the new Palace of Westminster. Lady Jane Grey was, like Mary Queen of Scots, a female whose sufferings attracted many painters, though none quite matched &quot;The Execution of Lady Jane Grey&quot;, one of many British historical subjects by the Frenchman Paul Delaroche. Painters prided themselves on the increasing accuracy of their period settings in terms of costume and objects, studying the collections of the new Victoria and Albert Museum and books, and scorning the breezy approximations of earlier generations of artists.
Victorian painting developed the Hogarthian social subject, packed with moralizing detail, and the tradition of illustrating scenes from literature, into a range of types of genre painting, many with only a few figures, others large and crowded scenes like Frith&#x27;s best-known works. Holman Hunt&#x27;s &quot;The Awakening Conscience&quot; (1853) and Augustus Egg&#x27;s set of &quot;Past and Present&quot; (1858) are of the first type, both dealing with &quot;fallen women&quot;, a perennial Victorian concern. As Peter Conrad points out, these were paintings designed to be read like novels, whose meaning emerged after the viewer had done the work of deciphering it. Other &quot;anecdotal&quot; scenes were lighter in mood, tending towards being captionless &quot;Punch&quot; cartoons.

Towards the end of the 19th century the problem picture left the details of the narrative action deliberately ambiguous, inviting the viewer to speculate on it using the evidence in front of them, but not supplying a final answer (artists learned to smile enigmatically when asked). This sometimes provoked discussion on sensitive social issues, typically involving women, that might have been hard to raise directly. They were enormously popular; newspapers ran competitions for readers to supply the meaning of the painting.

Many artists participated in the revival of original artistic printmaking usually known as the etching revival, although prints in many other techniques were also made. This began in the 1850s and continued until the fallout from the 1929 Wall Street Crash brought about a collapse in the very high prices that the most fashionable artists had been achieving.

British Orientalism, though not as common as in France at the same period, had many specialists, including John Frederick Lewis, who lived for nine years in Cairo, David Roberts, a Scot who made lithographs of his travels in the Middle East and Italy, the nonsense writer Edward Lear, a continual traveller who reached as far as Ceylon, and Richard Dadd. Holman Hunt also travelled to Palestine to obtain authentic settings for his Biblical pictures. The Frenchman James Tissot, who fled to London after the fall of the Paris Commune, divided his time between scenes of high society social events and a huge series of Biblical illustrations, made in watercolour for reproductive publication. Frederick Goodall specialized in scenes of Ancient Egypt.

Larger paintings concerned with the social conditions of the poor tended to concentrate on rural scenes, so that the misery of the human figures was at least offset by a landscape. Painters of these included Frederick Walker, Luke Fildes (although he made his name in 1874 with &quot;Applicants for Admission to a Casual Ward&quot;- see above), Frank Holl, George Clausen, and the German Hubert von Herkomer.

William Bell Scott, a friend of the Rossettis, painted historical scenes and other types of work, but was also one of the few artists to depict scenes from heavy industry. His memoirs are a useful source for the period, and he was one of several artists to be employed for a period in the greatly expanded system of government art schools, which were driven by the administrator Henry Cole (the inventor of the Christmas card) and employed Richard Redgrave, Edward Poynter, Richard Burchett, the Scottish designer Christopher Dresser and many others. Burchett was headmaster of the &quot;South Kensington Schools&quot;, now the Royal College of Art, which gradually replaced the Royal Academy School as the leading British art school, though around the start of the 20th century the Slade School of Fine Art produced many of the forward-looking artists.

The Royal Academy was initially by no means as conservative and restrictive as the Paris Salon, and the Pre-Raphaelites had most of their submissions for exhibition accepted, although like everyone else they complained about the positions their paintings were given. They were especially welcomed at the Liverpool Academy of Arts, one of the largest regional exhibiting organizations; the Royal Scottish Academy was founded in 1826 and opened its grand new building in the 1850s. There were alternative London locations like the British Institution, and as the conservatism of the Royal Academy gradually increased, despite the efforts of Lord Leighton when President, new spaces opened, notably the Grosvenor Gallery in Bond Street, from 1877, which became the home of the Aesthetic Movement. The New English Art Club exhibited from 1885 many artists with Impressionist tendencies, initially using the Egyptian Hall, opposite the Royal Academy, which also hosted many exhibitions of foreign art. The American portrait painter John Singer Sargent (1856‚Äì1925), spent most of his working career in Europe and he maintained his studio in London (where he died) from 1886 to 1907.

Alfred Sisley, who was French by birth but had British nationality, painted in France as one of the Impressionists; Walter Sickert and Philip Wilson Steer at the start of their careers were also strongly influenced, but despite the dealer Paul Durand-Ruel bringing many exhibitions to London, the movement made little impact in England until decades later. Some members of the Newlyn School of landscapes and genre scenes adopted a quasi-Impressionist technique while others used realist or more traditional levels of finish.

The late 19th century also saw the Decadent movement in France and the British Aesthetic movement. The British-based American painter James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Aubrey Beardsley, and the former Pre-Raphaelites Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Edward Burne-Jones are associated with those movements, with late Burne-Jones and Beardsley both being admired abroad and representing the nearest British approach to European Symbolism. In 1877 James McNeill Whistler sued the art critic John Ruskin for libel after the critic condemned his painting &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket&quot;. Ruskin accused Whistler of &quot;ask[ing] two hundred guineas for throwing a pot of paint in the public&#x27;s face.&quot; The jury reached a verdict in favor of Whistler but awarded him only a single farthing in nominal damages, and the court costs were split. The cost of the case, together with huge debts from building his residence (&quot;The White House&quot; in Tite Street, Chelsea, designed with E. W. Godwin, 1877‚Äì8), bankrupted Whistler by May 1879, resulting in an auction of his work, collections, and house. Stansky notes the irony that the Fine Art Society of London, which had organized a collection to pay for Ruskin&#x27;s legal costs, supported him in etching &quot;the stones of Venice&quot; (and in exhibiting the series in 1883) which helped recoup Whistler&#x27;s costs.
Scottish art was now regaining an adequate home market, allowing it to develop a distinctive character, of which the &quot;Glasgow Boys&quot; were one expression, straddling Impressionism in painting, and Art Nouveau, Japonism and the Celtic Revival in design, with the architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh now their best-known member. Painters included Thomas Millie Dow, George Henry, Joseph Crawhall and James Guthrie.

New printing technology brought a great expansion in book illustration with illustrations for children&#x27;s books providing much of the best remembered work of the period. Specialized artists included Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane, Kate Greenaway and, from 1902, Beatrix Potter.

The experience of military, political and economic power from the rise of the British Empire, led to a very specific drive in artistic technique, taste and sensibility in the United Kingdom. British people used their art &quot;to illustrate their knowledge and command of the natural world&quot;, whilst the permanent settlers in British North America, Australasia, and South Africa &quot;embarked upon a search for distinctive artistic expression appropriate to their sense of national identity&quot;. The empire has been &quot;at the centre, rather than in the margins, of the history of British art&quot;.

The enormous variety and massive production of the various forms of British decorative art during the period are too complex to be easily summarized. Victorian taste, until the various movements of the last decades, such as Arts and Crafts, is generally poorly regarded today, but much fine work was produced, and much money made. Both William Burges and Augustus Pugin were architects committed to the Gothic Revival, who expanded into designing furniture, metalwork, tiles and objects in other media. There was an enormous boom in re-Gothicising the fittings of medieval churches, and fitting out new ones in the style, especially with stained glass, an industry revived from effective extinction. The revival of furniture painted with images was a particular feature at the top end of the market.

From its opening in 1875 the London department store Liberty &amp; Co. was especially associated with imported Far Eastern decorative items and British goods in the new styles of the end of the 19th century. Charles Voysey was an architect who also did much design work in textiles, wallpaper furniture and other media, bringing the Arts and Crafts movement into Art Nouveau and beyond; he continued to design into the 1920s. A. H. Mackmurdo was a similar figure.

==20th century==

In many respects, the Victorian era continued until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and the Royal Academy became increasingly ossified; the unmistakably late Victorian figure of Frank Dicksee was appointed president in 1924. In photography Pictorialism aimed to achieve artistic indeed painterly effects; The Linked Ring contained the leading practitioners. The American John Singer Sargent was the most successful London portraitist at the start of the 20th century, with John Lavery, Augustus John and William Orpen rising figures. John&#x27;s sister Gwen John lived in France, and her intimate portraits were relatively little appreciated until decades after her death. British attitudes to modern art were &quot;polarized&quot; at the end of the 19th century. Modernist movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; Impressionism was initially regarded by &quot;many conservative critics&quot; as a &quot;subversive foreign influence&quot;, but became &quot;fully assimilated&quot; into British art during the early-20th century. The Irish artist Jack Butler Yeats (1871‚Äì1957), was based in Dublin, at once a romantic painter, a symbolist and an expressionist.

Vorticism was a brief coming together of a number of Modernist artists in the years immediately before 1914; members included Wyndham Lewis, the sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein, David Bomberg, Malcolm Arbuthnot, Lawrence Atkinson, the American photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn, Frederick Etchells, the French sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Cuthbert Hamilton, Christopher Nevinson, William Roberts, Edward Wadsworth, Jessica Dismorr, Helen Saunders, and Dorothy Shakespear. The early 20th century also includes The Sitwells artistic circle and the Bloomsbury Group, a group of mostly English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists, including painter Dora Carrington, painter and art critic Roger Fry, art critic Clive Bell, painter Vanessa Bell, painter Duncan Grant among others. Although very fashionable at the time, their work in the visual arts looks less impressive today. British modernism was to remain somewhat tentative until after World War II, though figures such as Ben Nicholson kept in touch with European developments.

Walter Sickert and the Camden Town Group developed an English style of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism with a strong strand of social documentary, including Harold Gilman, Spencer Frederick Gore, Charles Ginner, Robert Bevan, Malcolm Drummond and Lucien Pissarro (the son of French Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro). Where their colouring is often notoriously drab, the Scottish Colourists indeed mostly used bright light and colour; some, like Samuel Peploe and John Duncan Fergusson, were living in France to find suitable subjects. They were initially inspired by Sir William McTaggart (1835‚Äì1910), a Scottish landscape painter associated with Impressionism.
The reaction to the horrors of the First World War prompted a return to pastoral subjects as represented by Paul Nash and Eric Ravilious, mainly a printmaker. Stanley Spencer painted mystical works, as well as landscapes, and the sculptor, printmaker and typographer Eric Gill produced elegant simple forms in a style related to Art Deco. The Euston Road School was a group of &quot;progressive&quot; realists of the late 1930s, including the influential teacher William Coldstream. Surrealism, with artists including John Tunnard and the Birmingham Surrealists, was briefly popular in the 1930s, influencing Roland Penrose and Henry Moore. Stanley William Hayter was a British painter and printmaker associated in the 1930s with Surrealism and from 1940 onward with Abstract Expressionism. In 1927 Hayter founded the legendary &quot;Atelier 17&quot; studio in Paris. Since his death in 1988, it has been known as &quot;Atelier Contrepoint.&quot; Hayter became one of the most influential printmakers of the 20th century. Fashionable portraitists included Meredith Frampton in a hard-faced Art Deco classicism, Augustus John, and Sir Alfred Munnings if horses were involved. Munnings was President of the Royal Academy 1944‚Äì1949 and led a jeering hostility to Modernism. The photographers of the period include Bill Brandt, Angus McBean and the diarist Cecil Beaton.

Henry Moore emerged after World War II as Britain&#x27;s leading sculptor, promoted alongside Victor Pasmore, William Scott and Barbara Hepworth by the Festival of Britain. The &quot;London School&quot; of figurative painters including Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, and Michael Andrews have received widespread international recognition, while other painters such as John Minton and John Craxton are characterized as Neo-Romantics. Graham Sutherland, the Romantic landscapist John Piper (a prolific and popular lithographer), the sculptor Elisabeth Frink, and the industrial townscapes of L.S. Lowry also contributed to the strong figurative presence in post-war British art.
According to William Grimes of &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Lucien Freud and his contemporaries transformed figure painting in the 20th century. In paintings like &quot;Girl With a White Dog&quot; (1951-52), Freud put the pictorial language of traditional European painting in the service of an anti-romantic, confrontational style of portraiture that stripped bare the sitter‚Äôs social facade. Ordinary people ‚Äî many of them his friends ‚Äî stared wide-eyed from the canvas, vulnerable to the artist‚Äôs ruthless inspection.&quot; In 1952 at the 26th Venice Biennale a group of young British sculptors including Kenneth Armitage, Reg Butler, Lynn Chadwick, William Turnbull and Eduardo Paolozzi, exhibited works that demonstrated anti-monumental, expressionism. Scottish painter Alan Davie created a large body of abstract paintings during the 1950s that synthesize and reflect his interest in mythology and zen. Abstract art became prominent during the 1950s with Ben Nicholson, Terry Frost, Peter Lanyon and Patrick Heron, who were part of the St Ives school in Cornwall. In 1958, along with Kenneth Armitage and William Hayter, William Scott was chosen by the British Council for the British Pavilion at the XXIX Venice Biennale.

In the 1950s, the London-based Independent Group formed; from which pop art emerged in 1956 with the exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts &quot;This Is Tomorrow&quot;, as a British reaction to abstract expressionism. The International Group was the topic of a two-day, international conference at the Tate Britain in March 2007. The Independent Group is regarded as the precursor to the Pop Art movement in Britain and the United States. The &quot;This is Tomorrow&quot; show featured Scottish artist Eduardo Paolozzi, Richard Hamilton, and artist John McHale amongst others, and the group included the influential art critic Lawrence Alloway as well.

In the 1960s, Sir Anthony Caro became a leading figure of British sculpture along with a younger generation of abstract artists including Isaac Witkin, Phillip King and William G. Tucker. John Hoyland, Howard Hodgkin, John Walker, Ian Stephenson, Robyn Denny, John Plumb and William Tillyer were British painters who emerged at that time and who reflected the new international style of Color Field painting. During the 1960s another group of British artists offered a radical alternative to more conventional artmaking and they included Bruce McLean, Barry Flanagan, Richard Long and Gilbert and George. British pop art painters David Hockney, Patrick Caulfield, Derek Boshier, Peter Phillips, Peter Blake (best known for the cover-art for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;), Gerald Laing, the sculptor Allen Jones were part of the sixties art scene as was the British-based American painter R. B. Kitaj. Photorealism in the hands of Malcolm Morley (who was awarded the first Turner Prize in 1984) emerged in the 1960s as well as the op-art of Bridget Riley. Michael Craig-Martin was an influential teacher of some of the Young British Artists and is known for the conceptual work, &quot;An Oak Tree&quot; (1973).

==Contemporary art==

Post-modern, contemporary British art, particularly that of the Young British Artists, has been said to be &quot;characterised by a fundamental concern with material culture¬†... perceived as a post-imperial cultural anxiety&quot;. The annual Turner Prize, founded in 1984 and organized by the Tate, has developed as a highly publicized showcase for contemporary British art. Among the beneficiaries have been several members of the Young British Artists (YBA) movement, which includes Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, and Tracey Emin, who rose to prominence after the &quot;Freeze&quot; exhibition of 1988, with the backing of Charles Saatchi and achieved international recognition with their version of conceptual art. This often featured installations, notably Hirst&#x27;s vitrine containing a preserved shark. The Tate gallery and eventually the Royal Academy also gave them exposure. The influence of Saatchi&#x27;s generous and wide-ranging patronage was to become a matter of some controversy, as was that of Jay Jopling, the most influential London gallerist.

The &quot;Sensation&quot; exhibition of works from the Saatchi Collection was controversial in both the UK and the US, though in different ways. At the Royal Academy press-generated controversy centred on &quot;Myra&quot;, a very large image of the murderer Myra Hindley by Marcus Harvey, but when the show travelled to New York City, opening at the Brooklyn Museum in late 1999, it was met with intense protest about &quot;The Holy Virgin Mary&quot; by Chris Ofili, which had not provoked this reaction in London. While the press reported that the piece was smeared with elephant dung, although Ofili&#x27;s work in fact showed a carefully rendered black Madonna decorated with a resin-covered lump of elephant dung. The figure is also surrounded by small collage images of female genitalia from pornographic magazines; these seemed from a distance to be the traditional cherubim. Among other criticism, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had seen the work in the catalogue but not in the show, called it &quot;sick stuff&quot; and threatened to withdraw the annual $7 million City Hall grant from the Brooklyn Museum hosting the show, because &quot;You don&#x27;t have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else&#x27;s religion.&quot;

In 1999, the Stuckists figurative painting group which includes Billy Childish and Charles Thomson was founded as a reaction to the YBAs. In 2004, the Walker Art Gallery staged &quot;The Stuckists Punk Victorian&quot;, the first national museum exhibition of the Stuckist art movement. The Federation of British Artists hosts shows of traditional figurative painting. Jack Vettriano and Beryl Cook have widespread popularity, but not establishment recognition. Banksy made a reputation with street graffiti and is now a highly valued mainstream artist.

Antony Gormley produces sculptures, mostly in metal and based on the human figure, which include the 20 metres (66¬†ft) high &quot;Angel of the North&quot; near Gateshead, one of the first of a number of very large public sculptures produced in the 2000s, &quot;Another Place&quot;, and &quot;Event Horizon&quot;. The Indian-born sculptor Anish Kapoor has public works around the world, including &quot;Cloud Gate&quot; in Chicago and &quot;Sky Mirror&quot; in various locations; like much of his work these use curved mirror-like steel surfaces. The environmental sculptures of British land artist Andy Goldsworthy have been created in many locations around the world. Using natural found materials they are often very ephemeral, and are recorded in photographs of which several collections in book form have been published. Grayson Perry works in various media, including ceramics. Whilst leading printmakers include Norman Ackroyd, Elizabeth Blackadder, Barbara Rae and Richard Spare.

<text>Renee Ilene Sandstrom, known professionally as Renee Sands is an American singer and former child actress. She is best known for her role as Renee on &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;, and as a vocal member of the American girl group Wild Orchid.

==Early life==
Sands was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. Renee is the youngest of four children. She grew up singing and had a band with her family.

==Career==
In 1983, Sands starred in the pilot of the hit 1980s musical children&#x27;s show &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;. It was never released on television, but was released on VHS in 1985. She starred on the show&#x27;s first four seasons from 1984 to 1987, where she eventually became the oldest female character. She started on the show at the age of 10 and ended at 13.

As a child, she also finished second to Scott Grimes on a Boston talent show called, Community Auditions. Sands also opened for acts that include Wayne Newton, Bob Hope, and Debbie Reynolds. She sang in the children&#x27;s chorus with other &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; cast members on Martika&#x27;s hit &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;.

From 1990 to 2003, alongside her former &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; costar (TV sister), Stacy Ferguson, and her high school friend, Stefanie Ridel, Sands was a member of the 1990s band Wild Orchid. She was a member through the band&#x27;s entirety.

Wild Orchid was an American girl group consisting of Stacy Ferguson, Stefanie Ridel, and Renee Sandstrom. Beginning under the name &quot;NRG&quot; in 1990, the group changed their name to Wild Orchid in 1992 and signed with RCA Records in 1994. The group released two albums, earning Billboard Music Awards nominations with their debut. In 2001, Ferguson left the group. Sandstrom and Ridel continued as a duo, releasing Wild Orchid&#x27;s final album Hypnotic in 2003. In 2013, Us Weekly named the group number 18 of the 25 &#x27;Best Girl Groups of All Time&#x27;.

Sands sang &quot;Just Like We Dreamed It&quot; with Ruben Martinez as the 15th anniversary theme for Disneyland Paris. She had a role in the Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Camp Rock&quot;, providing the singing voice for Jasmine Richards&#x27; character Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Dupree, singing the song &quot;Here I Am&quot;. She sang &quot;Love from Afar&quot; on the soundtrack for &quot;Just Friends&quot;. In 2003, she and her Wild Orchid partner Stephanie Ridel starred in the movie, Pink Ladies.

In 2012, she sang &quot;I Think I Like You&quot; with the band Eagle Eye. The song was featured in season two of &quot;Dance Moms&quot;. In 2021, Renee sang the theme song for the new Disney Junior show &quot;The Chicken Squad&quot;.

==Personal life==
On October 10, 2008, Renee was married in a private ceremony in Los Angeles, California to retirement investment expert Robby Welles. The couple has a daughter.

<text>Jabez Spencer Balfour (4 September 1843 ‚Äì 23 February 1916) was an English businessman, British Liberal Party politician and fraudster.

==Life==
Balfour was born in Marylebone, London to James and Clara Lucas Balfour.

He was Member of Parliament for Tamworth from 1880 to 1885, and for Burnley from 1889 to 1893. Balfour was also interested in local politics in his home town of Croydon, Surrey where he regularly topped the poll for the school board. When Croydon was awarded borough status in 1883 he was selected as charter mayor and re-elected for a second term. In 1885 he stood as Liberal candidate in Croydon at the general election but lost to the Conservatives. He also stood unsuccessfully for the Liberals at Walworth in 1886.

In 1880 he was appointed chairman of the Northampton Street Tramways.

Together with City financiers Leopold Salomons and Sir John Pender, Balfour founded the investment underwriting firm the &quot;Trustees, Executors and Securities Insurance Corporation, Limited&quot; in December 1887.

In 1892, he was at the centre of a scandal over the failure of a series of companies which he set up and controlled, starting with the London and General Bank and culminating in the Liberator Building Society, leaving thousands of investors penniless. Instead of advancing money to home buyers, the Liberator had advanced money to property companies to buy properties owned by him, at a high price. After the swindle was discovered, Balfour fled the country. He was arrested in Argentina by Inspector Frank Froest of Scotland Yard in 1895; with extradition proceedings held up by legal wrangling, Froest simply bundled Balfour into a train and then a boat sailing for England, &quot;The Tartar Prince&quot;. The captain of the ship, Thomas Hesketh, later received a letter from Balfour thanking him for the kindness and hospitality shown during the trip back to England. Balfour was tried at the Old Bailey and sentenced to 14 years penal servitude, most of which was served in harsh conditions in Portland prison, and he was released in 1906.

After his release from prison in 1906, his memoirs were serialised by Lord Northcliffe&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Despatch&quot; newspaper. Balfour died aged 72 on 23 February 1916, on a train from London to Wales, heading for a job as a mining consultant.

He married Ellen Mead in 1866. By 1880 her mental condition had deteriorated and she became a patient in the Priory Hospital, Roehampton. They had a son, James, in 1868 and four grandchildren.

==Legacy==
Present day South Norwood, in the London Borough of Croydon, has a Balfour Road which is named after Jabez Balfour.

So does Ilford, Essex, where Balfour Road is on the former Ilford Lodge estate, bought for development by Balfour&#x27;s group. In the same area Wellesley Road is named after his Croydon house and Morland Road after the road where Hobbs and Co, the builders, had their offices in Croydon. Also nearby is Granville Road: Granville was the middle name of the group&#x27;s solicitor.

His name has, however, been erased from the memorial plaques at Croydon University Hospital (formerly Mayday Hospital).

Croydon Road and Tamworth Road in Arthur&#x27;s Hill, Newcastle upon Tyne, were built using funds invested in the Liberator Building Society and named in tribute to Balfour.

Balfour plays a central role in the tabletop game &quot;Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective&quot;.

<text>The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation CW to the fleet of AC electric multiple units used on the lines to Coulsdon and Wallington. They were planned by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, but were delayed by World War I and the grouping and were introduced by the Southern Railway.

== Construction ==
The CW (Coulsdon and Wallington stock) units were built in 1923‚Äì1924, as the last electric train stock for use on the LBSCR AC overhead electrified lines in South London. This stock comprised some hundred carriages, which were used in five-car formations: Driving Trailer Third (DTT) + Driving Trailer Composite (DTC) + Motor Luggage Van (MLV) + Trailer Composite (TC) + Driving Trailer Third (DTT).

The stock, built by the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company at Birmingham, was as follows:

* 21 Motor Luggage Vans
* 60 Driving Trailers
* 20 Trailers

The Motor Luggage Vans (nicknamed &quot;Milk Vans&quot;) each had four GEC traction motors.

After the replacement of the AC overhead equipment by the 660 V DC third rail system adopted as standard by the SR, the carriages that formed these units were rebuilt accordingly, the Motor Luggage Vans becoming bogie goods train brake vans.

<text>Irun (, ) is a town of the Bidasoaldea region in the province of Gipuzkoa in the Basque Autonomous Community, Spain.

== History ==
It lies on the foundations of the ancient Oiasso, cited as a Roman-Vasconic town.

During the Spanish Civil War, the city was site of the 1936 Battle of Irun, which ended with a strategic victory for the Nationalist forces.

==Geography and transport==
One of the biggest towns in Gipuzkoa, its location on the border between Spain and France, across the Bidasoa river from Hendaye, has made Irun into a commercial and logistic centre. Irun railway station is a major break-of-gauge where the SNCF rails meet the broad gauge Renfe ones.

Currently Irun has a fairground with a modern exhibition and telecommunication facilities, just some 100 metres away from the actual border at the Santiago Bridge (river Bidasoa).

Irun is part of the conurbation of Txingudi bay with Hondarribia and Hendaye; the town is also within the area of the Eurocit√© Basque Bayonne-San Sebasti√°n, a European economic interest grouping. (fr)

==Culture and tourism==
One of its main festivals is the Alarde de San Marcial, a parade recreating an episode of the Peninsular War, held every year on 30 June.

There are hot mineral springs in the town.

===Sports===
The town is home to one of Europe&#x27;s top handball teams, CD Bidasoa, who play at the Artaleku Udal Kiroldegia.

Its football club is Real Uni√≥n who play in the third tier, and are based at Stadium Gal. There is a in the seventh tier.

==Climate==
Irun has an oceanic climate courtesy of strong maritime moderation from the Bay of Biscay. Rainfall is frequent year-round since Irun is on the windward side of the Pyrenees. Rain often falls in high quantities on individual days with falling on just 138 days.

<text>The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation CP to the fleet of AC electric multiple units used on the former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway lines in the Crystal Palace area.

==Construction==
The CP (Crystal Palace stock) units were built in 1911‚Äì1913 to provide the electric train stock required for the LBSCR AC overhead electrification to Crystal Palace and the surrounding area. This stock comprised some 90 cars, which were used in three-car formations, usually (Driving Trailer Composite+Driving Motor Brake Third+Driving Trailer Composite).

Thirty motor coaches and 30 driving trailers were built by the Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Co. Ltd. in 1911. Each motor coach had four Winter Eichberg motors. A further 26 driving trailers were built at the LBSC&#x27;s Lancing Carriage Works. In 1912, four additional motor and trailer pairs were delivered by MAC&amp;W&#x27;s successor, the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company. Lancing Works built eight more trailers the following year. 

After the replacement of the AC overhead equipment by the 660 V DC third rail system adopted as standard by the SR, the carriages that formed these units were rebuilt accordingly.

==Formations==
The LB&amp;SCR originally did not buy sufficient stock for 30 sets, on the grounds that the trailers cars would be quicker to overhaul than the motor cars. Fixed formations were not used, and as the Motor cars had cabs, the CP stock could be used in trains of two to six vehicles.
