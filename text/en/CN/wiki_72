<text>Hopcalite is the trade name for a number of mixtures that mainly consist of oxides of copper and manganese, which are used as catalysts for the conversion of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide when exposed to the oxygen in the air at room temperature.

The name &quot;hopcalite&quot; is derived from Johns Hopkins University - &quot;Hop&quot; and the University of California - &quot;Cal&quot;, where basic research into carbon monoxide was carried out during the First World War and these catalysts were discovered in 1918.

A variety of compositions are known, such as &quot;hopcalite II&quot; that is approximately 60% manganese dioxide and 40% copper oxide (the MnO2 : CuO molar ratio is 1.375) and &quot;hopcalite I&quot; that is a mixture of 50% MnO, 30% CuO, 15% Co2O3, and 5% Ag2O. Hopcalite has the properties of a porous mass and resembles activated carbon in its appearance.

== Preparation ==
While typically hopcalite catalysts are prepared by calcining intimate mixtures of oxides and carbonates, various techniques have been employed for producing hopcalites in the laboratory and on an industrial scale, such as physical mixing of the (finely divided) metal oxides, co-precipitation of the metal oxides from metal salt solutions (see salts), thermal decomposition of mixtures of metal nitrates (see nitrate) and metal carbonates (see carbonate), one-step synthesis via flame spray pyrolysis from organic and inorganic precursor systems, e.g. Nanophase hopcalite catalysts have also been described.

Although hopcalite-based catalysts have been used in practice for decades, many questions regarding their mode of action are still open. This is due to their complex structures, which make it difficult to obtain information about the active centers and the mechanisms of catalysis and deactivation.

== Applications ==
Hopcalite is widely used in personal respiratory protective equipment (RPE) and collective protective equipment, among others.
Different uses of hopcalite catalysts are listed below:

* in some types of gas mask filters designed to protect from carbon monoxide (Soviet-made DP-1, combined filters VK-450, SX (CO) filters, e.g.)
* in air filtration systems and breathing apparatus to purify breathing air supplies, for example those utilised in scuba diving, and firefighting.
* used as the main filtration ingredient in the self rescue respirators issued to miners (SPP-4)
* filtering self-rescuers designed for use in fire conditions (GDZK-EN, GDZK-U, GDZK-A, e.g.)
* in devices for monitoring the content of carbon monoxide (CO) in rooms
* used as a precaution with submersible air compressors, if they are driven by internal combustion engines (like on ships)

In respiratory protective equipment, hopcalite is used to facilitate the rapid oxidation of the toxic carbon monoxide to harmless carbon dioxide with the oxygen from the air, which is then chemically bound to a sodium hydroxide layer, thus eliminating CO from the air stream, (which otherwise is not removed by activated charcoal air filters). Water vapor poisons the hopcalite catalyst, so a silica-based filter is introduced beforehand to prevent this. In addition to that, the hopcalite layer is protected by a mechanical filter and a layer of activated carbon, purify the air of other contaminants.
The operation of carbon monoxide (CO) detectors, on the other hand, is based on recording the heat released during the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide (CO2).

Although primarily used to catalyze the conversion of CO to CO2, hopcalite catalysts are also used to remove ethylene oxide and other VOCs as well as ozone from gas streams.
In addition, hopcalites catalyze the oxidation of various organic compounds at elevated temperatures (200–500 °C).

<doc id="1254909" wikidata="Q193061" url="?curid=1254909" title="Cricetidae">
<text>The Cricetidae are a family of rodents in the large and complex superfamily Muroidea. It includes true hamsters, voles, lemmings, muskrats, and New World rats and mice. At over 870 species, it is either the largest or second-largest family of mammals, and has members throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia.

== Characteristics ==
The cricetids are small mammals, ranging from just in length and in weight in the New World pygmy mouse up to and in the muskrat. The length of their tails varies greatly in relation to their bodies, and they may be either furred or sparsely haired. The fur of most species is brownish in colour, often with a white underbelly, but many other patterns exist, especially in the cricetine and arvicoline subfamilies.

Like the Old World mice, cricetids are adapted to a wide range of habitats, from the high Arctic to tropical rainforests and hot deserts. Some are arboreal, with long balancing tails and other adaptations for climbing, while others are semiaquatic, with webbed feet and small external ears. Yet others are burrowing animals, or ground-dwellers.

Their diets are similarly variable, with herbivorous, omnivorous, and insectivorous species all being known. They all have large, gnawing, incisors separated from grinding molar teeth by a gap, or diastema. Molar teeth may be buno-lophodont like in cricetines or lophodont like in arvicolines or some New World mice. Although a few exceptions occur, the dental formula for the great majority of cricetids is: 
Cricetids&#x27; populations can increase rapidly in times of plenty, due to a combination of short gestation periods between 15 and 50 days, and large litter sizes relative to many other mammals. The young are typically born blind, hairless, and helpless.

== Evolution and systematics ==

The cricetids first evolved in the Old World during the Early Oligocene. They soon adapted to a wide range of habitats, and spread throughout the world. The voles and lemmings arose later, during the Pliocene, and rapidly diversified during the Pleistocene.

The circumscription of Cricetidae has gone through several permutations. Some members of the family as currently defined have been placed in the family Muridae. Some muroids have historically been placed in Cricetidae, such as mouse-like hamsters (subfamily Calomyscinae, family Calomyscidae), gerbils (subfamily Gerbillinae, family Muridae), the crested rat (subfamily Lophiomyinae, family Muridae), zokors (subfamily Myospalacinae, family Spalacidae), the white-tailed rat (subfamily Mystromyinae, family Nesomyidae), and spiny dormice (subfamily Platacanthomyinae, family Platacanthomyidae). Multigene DNA sequence studies have shown the subfamilies listed below to form a monophyletic group (that is, they share a common ancestor more recently than with any other group), and other groups now considered muroids should not be included in the Cricetidae.

The cricetids thus currently include one fossil and five extant subfamilies, with about 112 living genera and 580 species:
* Arvicolinae — voles, lemmings, muskrat
* Cricetinae — hamsters
* †Democricetodontinae (fossil)
* Neotominae — North American rats and mice, including deer mice, pack rats, and grasshopper mice
* Sigmodontinae — New World rats and mice, predominantly South American, such as brucies
* Tylomyinae — New World climbing rats and relatives
* †&quot;Copemys&quot; (fossil)
* †&quot;Eumys&quot; (fossil)
* †&quot;Wilsoneumys&quot; (fossil)

<text>The IAI Lavi (, &quot;lion&quot;) is a single-engined fourth-generation multirole jet fighter developed in Israel, by Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), during the 1980s. The decision to develop the Lavi was controversial, both with the Israeli public, due to the enormous associated costs, and particularly with the U.S. government due to competition with American jets on the export market. By 1984 Israel, with a population of 4 million, had amongst the world&#x27;s highest military expenditure as a proportion of GDP, at approximately 18.9%, which was considered unsustainable. These issues contributed to the ultimate cancellation of the aircraft, by the Israeli government, during the flight-test phase of development in August 1987.

The Israeli cabinet&#x27;s late-stage cancellation of the program, by a 12–11 vote, continued to arouse controversy and bitterness in Israel for decades, with Moshe Arens, the main political figure behind the Lavi project, stating in 2013 that if the project had not been cancelled the IAF &quot;would be operating the world&#x27;s most advanced fighter, upgraded over the years to incorporate operational experience and newer technology.&quot;

The Lavi performed successfully in flight-tests, with its flight handling described as &quot;excellent&quot; by test pilots. The Lavi was planned to be the mainstay of the Israeli Air Force, and considerable export sales for the aircraft had been forecast. The uniqueness of its design was in the combination of a small, aerodynamic, highly maneuverable plane, with sophisticated, software-rich systems, low armed drag due to semi-conformal weapons carriage, and the ability to carry a large payload at high speed and over long distances. , two of the prototypes have been preserved, and have been placed on public display.

==Development==
===Origins===
Conceptually, the Lavi had its origins in the idea espoused by IAF commander and Minister of Defence Ezer Weizman that Israel&#x27;s combat aircraft should fall into &#x27;two-tiers&#x27; – a small number of high performance aircraft and a larger bulk with less sophistication and complexity. In the mid-1970s, the plane that was to become the Lavi was meant to be a multirole fighter-bomber to replace aging IAF aircraft such as the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and IAI Kfir; however continuous revisions of the proposed aircraft led to the incorporation of more advanced technologies and ideas to produce an ambitious aircraft in the class of the American General Dynamics F-16. The IAF was estimated to have a requirement for 300 aircraft, 60 of which were expected to be combat-capable two-seat trainers.

In February 1980, a milestone towards the development of the Lavi occurred when the Israeli government granted its authorisation for the IAF to present its list of technical specifications and requirements which sought the IAF&#x27;s envisioned future fighter aircraft. While the Lavi was heavily influenced by these requirements, it was also affected by concepts of the wider strategic situation that Israel was confronted by. Menachem Eine, who headed the Lavi program, concluded that any proposed aircraft would be subject to a substantially greater threat than any envisioned US fighter, and would have to be developed with these threats in mind. Eine observed that the aircraft needed to not only take into consideration the best Soviet armaments that would be potentially faced in combat, but the best American equipment as well, as both Egypt and Saudi Arabia were being supplied with modern American fighter aircraft.

In addition to the primary intention to perform air-to-ground missions, the IAF sought to configure the Lavi to perform various other roles, as Israel perceived the likelihood of a potential sustained conflict under which there would be a need to fight for aerial supremacy against the efforts of multiple neighbouring adversaries to be high. The Lavi was therefore designed to possess both the flight performance and capabilities to perform as an effective supplement to the IAF&#x27;s own F-15 fleet in carrying out aerial combat missions. As the Lavi was viewed as being relatively easy to fly, the aircraft was also under consideration as an advanced jet trainer as well.

Early on, IAI decided to adopt a delta wing configuration, of which the company was already familiar with through its work on the earlier Kfir, which was paired with large, steerable canards situated forward of the wing. The delta wing arrangement was relatively low-weight, provided space for considerable fuel capacity, a smooth low-altitude flight attitude, and high levels of directional stability while flown at high angles of attack (AOA). The canard generated additional lift and positive control when at high AOAs. While this configuration afforded excellent maneuverability, it also exhibited natural instability during flight. To compensate, the Lavi was fitted with a sophisticated digital fly-by-wire system which allowed the aircraft to take advantage of this particular wing design while eliminating this shortcoming. The Lavi was one of the first aircraft to feature this type of configuration, which has since become more commonplace amongst fighter aircraft.

The adoption of certain components, such as an engine produced by Pratt &amp; Whitney, were viewed as foregone conclusions; the Beit Shemesh engine plant already had an established relationship with the company and planned to co-produce the engine, thus enabling some of the manufacturing to be carried out domestically in Israel. Some elements of the engine had to be manufactured in the US due to some of the design aspects having been classified as secret. The development of the Lavi was viewed by some figures in Israeli military and government circles, most notably Moshe Arens and Shimon Peres, as being an important program to modernise Israeli industry overall and to increase its technical ability, helping the nation progress towards becoming a developed nation.

===Testing===
The development program was planned to involve a total of five prototypes of the Lavi being completed, three of which were to have used a two-seat cockpit configuration.

On 31 December 1986, the first prototype took off on its maiden flight. The test pilot, Menachem Shmul, head of IAI&#x27;s Air Operations section, took off at 13:21 and stayed in the air for 26 minutes, during which he checked the engine and controls. The handling was described as &quot;excellent&quot;, with a high degree of stability in crosswind landings. About three months later, a second &quot;Lavi&quot; prototype took to the air; it featured improvements and additional features over the first, with a belly-mounted fuel tank, a special midair refuelling probe and several new avionic systems. Both B-01 and B-02 were tandem two-seaters, with the rear cockpit occupied by test equipment. By August 1987, the month in which the Lavi was canceled, a total of 82 sorties had reportedly been flown between the two completed prototypes, during which a significant proportion of the flight envelope had been explored.

===Controversy and cancellation===
While the Lavi had attracted the steadfast support of IAF veteran and Likud minister Moshe Arens, there was considerable dissent over the development. While the U.S. was a key partner in the aircraft&#x27;s development, there was vocal political opposition to financing the Lavi, which may have been a competitive aircraft in the export market against American aircraft such as the F-16C/D and the F/A-18C/D. The Lavi would have also required a great deal of other competing military requirements and sought investments to be abandoned, thus there were elements of the armed forces that did not support the project and those officers who felt that the F-16 possessed similar performance to the Lavi and was readily available already, making the foreign F-16 cheaper and easier to procure. IAF Major General Avihu Ben-Nun argued in favour of canceling the Lavi and acquiring 75 F-16s instead.
Proponents, such as the Minister without Portfolio Moshe Arens, advocated that the Lavi was a high prestige program, asserting Israeli technological capabilities and would work to the nation&#x27;s economic advantage. A failure to proceed with the development could lead to significant job losses and possibly contribute to emigration; the Israeli State Comptroller argued the resulting unemployment was negligible. Arens was keen to promote potential partnerships and technology exchanges in regards to the Lavi. Perhaps optimistically, IAI had projected export sales of the Lavi to be as many as 407 units to customers including South Africa, Chile, Taiwan, and Argentina; there were reports of significant South African interest and involvement during the early development of the Lavi. In a later development, however, Israel gave the U.S. explicit guarantees that the Lavi would not be made available to export.
Prior to and following the cancellation, IAI employees organised numerous demonstrations and public appeals to rally support for the Lavi; public opinion was roughly evenly divided on the subject of the Lavi. In the US, there was considerable opposition to the Lavi program from the Pentagon due to the fear that the heavy financial costs would impair other military capabilities, there were also questions about the financial soundness of the project and that Lavi technologies may be shared with South Africa, which had a history of close military cooperation with Israel. The financial burden of developing the Lavi were such that the Governor of the Bank of Israel, Michael Bruno, publicly stated that Israel could not realistically afford the &quot;luxury of producing fighter-aircraft&quot; and would harm overall economic growth.

On 30 August 1987, Israel&#x27;s cabinet conducted a decisive vote on whether to continue the development of the Lavi; this development was influenced by considerable lobbying by the U.S., who made several compensatory proposals in exchange for the cancellation. The vote was highly politicised, the Israeli Labor Party ordered its members to vote against the project. The Cabinet rejected the continuation at a margin of 12–11, with one cabinet member abstaining. Following the outcome of the vote, Lavi supporter Moshe Arens offered his resignation, refusing to be associated with the decision to terminate the aircraft. Shortly afterwards, Israel approved the purchase of 90 F-16Cs from the United States, which acted as an effective replacement to the Lavi. It was reported that China and South Africa were interested in continuing with the development of the Lavi.

===Aftermath and legacy===
When the Lavi project was canceled in 1987, a total of five airframes had been manufactured. Prototypes B-01 and B-02 had been completed, while B-03, B-04, and B-05 were incomplete. Parts from B-01 and B-02 were pulled to complete B-03. The gutted airframe of B-02 was subsequently placed on static display at the Israeli Air Force museum at Hatzerim Airbase; the remaining units, B-01, B-04 and B-05, were all ultimately scrapped. Two years after the project&#x27;s cancelation, IAI completed the third Lavi prototype (B-03), which made its first flight on 25 September 1989. B-03 proceeded to serve as a technology demonstrator and as a flying testbed for various internal IAI development projects; the aircraft saw later use as a ground testbed as well.
While the Lavi project had been terminated without any production aircraft being produced, the development represented an important opportunity to demonstrate and advance the capabilities of Israel&#x27;s aerospace industry. Many of the aircraft&#x27;s subsystems, avionics, and components went on to be developed and made commercially available, fueling defense export sales and proving to be a lucrative business in its own right. The EL/M-2032 pulse doppler radar, which had originally been developed for use on the Lavi is one such example; it has since been exported and equipped upon a wide range of operational aircraft.

Despite the Lavi&#x27;s cancellation, the investment in its development had significant results. The technological knowledge accumulated during the development contributed to the achievement of Israel&#x27;s first launch of a satellite into space in 1988. It resulted in a new level in avionics systems, and contributed to Israel&#x27;s high-tech boom of the 1990s by releasing into the economy the technological talents of around 5,000 Israeli scientists and engineers who had been employed on this one project; many, for example, were reemployed on the Arrow anti-ballistic missile program.

In July 2013, the IAF announced that the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master, an advanced trainer aircraft that it was in the process of procuring at the time, would receive the name Lavi in Israeli service; a total of 30 M-346s are to be operated by the service from 2014.

===China question===
In 2008, aviation publishing house Jane&#x27;s alleged that China&#x27;s development of the Chengdu J-10 had benefited from technical information from the Lavi project, citing Russian engineers who claim to have heard this from Chinese colleagues. In 2007, the J-10&#x27;s designer, Song Wencong (宋文骢), denied any connection with the Lavi, pointing to similarities with the Chengdu J-9 developed in the 1960s. This was echoed by PLAAF major Zhang Weigang in a 2012 interview. There have been no public statements or formal claims along those lines; by 2000, however, advanced technology transfer to China of any origin had become anathema to the US, which forced Israel to cancel a sale of Phalcon airborne early warning planes.

==Design==
===Overview===
The IAI Lavi was a single-seat, single-engine multirole fighter aircraft, principally designed to conduct high-speed penetration and first-pass bombing missions while maintaining a high level of manoeuvrability and survivability. The Lavi was almost 1,300 kg lighter in empty weight than its contemporary F-16 block 30 (7,030 vs 8,300 kg).

It was envisioned that the Lavi&#x27;s lifecycle costs would be considerably beneath those of the F-16. Efforts were also made to achieve a lower procurement cost as well. Like the F-16, the Lavi was an aerodynamically unstable aircraft, employing a quadruplex-redundant digital fly-by-wire system in order to provide stability and control; this was one of the aircraft&#x27;s more innovative features.

The Lavi was powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1120 turbofan engine, capable of generating 20,260 lb of thrust and enabling the aircraft to attain a maximum speed of Mach 1.85. The engine, which was derived from the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 that powered the F-16, was the only aspect of the aircraft that Eine acknowledged to have created a dependency upon the US. While carrying eight 750 lb bombs the Lavi possessed a combat radius of 250 nmi; an alternative armament of 2,000 lb bombs enabled a 650 nmi combat radius. Possessing a 1.1:1 thrust-to-weight ratio while equipped with a combat payload, the airframe of the Lavi was designed to be capable of routinely withstanding up to 9g.

===Airframe===
The Lavi employed a mainly traditional airframe, the majority of development focus being upon the avionics and systems to provide the aircraft&#x27;s performance edge instead. In order to meet the low structural weight requirements imposed, the use of composite materials was employed in elements such as the wing and its substructure, as well as the fin and the skin. The forward fuselage was shaped in a manner that resulted in it naturally directing air into the engine intake and to avoid inlet blanking while flown at a sideslip condition.

===Avionics===
According to Eine, the Lavi&#x27;s main area of advancement over its contemporaries was the level of integration of avionics and onboard electronics; it was claimed that the Lavi was &quot;more computerised than any other system in the world&quot;. A key innovation was the use of a quadruplex-redundant digital fly-by-wire flight control system, which was co-developed by Lear Siegler and IAI. If it had been brought into service, the Lavi may have become the first operational aircraft to employ fully digital flight controls.

IAI subsidiary Elta held responsibility for the electronic warfare self-protection systems. These are claimed to have been capable of rapid threat identification and automated response, incorporating a suite of active and passive countermeasures, such as power-managed noise and deception jamming systems. Both podded and internal countermeasures were to be used. Elta also developed the EL/M-2032 Doppler multi-mode radar for the Lavi, which was equipped with a programmable signal processor and was capable of various air-to-air and air-to-ground modes, including high-resolution mapping, terrain avoidance, and look-down/shoot-down functionality.

<text>Avraham &quot;Bren&quot; Adan (; – ) was an Israeli major-general and author. Prior to Israel&#x27;s independence, he served with the Palmach, an elite formation within the Haganah paramilitary force of the Yishuv community in British Mandatory Palestine. Adan fought under the Haganah and later under the newly formed Israel Defense Forces during the First Arab–Israeli War, and was photographed while raising the Israeli Ink Flag at the site of what is now Eilat to mark the end of the war. He served with the Israel Defense Forces from 1948 to 1977, and fought in all of the major Arab–Israeli wars that occurred during that period.

==Biography==
Adan was born into a Jewish family on 5 October 1926 in Kfar Giladi, British Mandatory Palestine; he was born with the surname &quot;Eidelson&quot;, but later changed it to &quot;Adan&quot; as part of a Hebraization process. In 1943, he joined the Palmach, an elite force of the Haganah paramilitary organization that operated on part of the Yishuv community in British Palestine. During the First Arab–Israeli War, Adan was a company commander in the 8th battalion of the Negev Brigade, and participated in Operation Uvda, in which the brigade successfully captured the Jordanian-held outpost of Umm al-Rashrash—now known as Eilat—at the southernmost tip of the newly created country. Adan, then a captain in the newly formed Israel Defense Forces (IDF), was photographed while raising the Ink Flag of the State of Israel at the site. The photograph has since become an icon, and has been compared to &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;, an iconic photograph in which six United States Marines are raising the American flag atop Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II.

In 1949, Adan joined the Israeli Armoured Corps and founded the first M4 Sherman tank unit of the IDF. During the Suez Crisis of 1956, he commanded the 82nd battalion of the 7th Armoured Brigade in the Sinai Peninsula, decisively defeating Egyptian forces in the region. After the war, Adan became the operations officer of the Armoured Corps and later the commander of the 7th Armoured Brigade as well as the Armoured Corps School. During the Third Arab–Israeli War, he was the deputy commander of the Armoured Corps and of the 31st Armoured Division, where he once again engaged Egyptian forces in the Sinai. On 10 March 1969, he became the commander of the Armoured Corps.

Adan was defending the northern portion of the Suez Canal in the Sinai—occupied by Israel in its entirety during the 1967 war—when the Fourth Arab–Israeli War broke out in October 1973. During the war, he served as the commander of the 162nd Division, which suffered severe losses from 6–8 October during repeated attempts to stop the Egyptian assault and push Egyptian forces back across the canal. Later during the war, Adan led his unit across the canal and into Egyptian territory north of the Great Bitter Lake during Operation Stouthearted Men, and subsequently maneuvered his forces southward to Suez City, where they surrounded the Egyptian Third Army.

From 1974 to 1977, he served as the military attaché at the Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C.

Adan was a co-founder of the kibbutzim of Nirim and Gvulot, located in the Negev Desert near the Palestinian Gaza Strip.

<doc id="1254931" wikidata="Q8353232" url="?curid=1254931" title="The Way Things Work">
<text>The Way Things Work is a 1988 nonfiction book by David Macaulay with technical text by Neil Ardley. It is a whimsical introduction to everyday machines and the scientific principles behind their operation, describing machines as simple as levers and gears and as complicated as radio telescopes and automatic transmissions. Every page consists primarily of one or more large diagrams describing the operation of the relevant machine. These diagrams are informative but playful, in that most show the machines operated, used upon, or represented by woolly mammoths, and are accompanied by anecdotes from a mysterious inventor of the mammoths&#x27; (fictive) role in the operation. The book&#x27;s concept was later developed into two short-lived animated TV shows (the former produced by Millimages and distributed by Schlessinger Media, and the latter produced by Children&#x27;s Television Workshop and Film Roman), a Dorling Kindersley interactive CD-ROM (including a spin-off pinball game, &quot;Pinball Science&quot;), and a board game. A family &quot;ride&quot; involving animatronics and a 3-D film based on the book was one of the original attractions at the San Francisco Metreon, but closed in 2001.

==Revised editions==
A revised and updated version, &quot;The New Way Things Work&quot;, released on October 26, 1998, contains additional text on the workings of computers and digital technology. A number of pages were dropped, among them a two-page demonstration of a mechanical coin-operated parking meter and the original descriptions of computing. The original&#x27;s computing section included four pages explaining the workings and the distinctions between a calculator and a general-purpose computer, and four pages on binary arithmetic, logical AND and OR gates, and how these are assembled into a half adder and full adder; these were replaced with entirely new art and more detailed descriptions, with a longer story, &#x27;The Last Mammoth&#x27;, depicting a lonely mammoth invited to visit the &#x27;Digital Domain&#x27; by its proprietor Bill, which uses the mammoth&#x27;s assistance and a humorous pumpkin-and-apple-based mechanical computer to create a video depiction of a community of mammoths. Like the previous version, a CD-ROM version was released.

A substantially revised edition, &quot;The Way Things Work Now&quot;, was published in October 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Dorling Kindersley.

==Contents for &quot;The New Way Things Work&quot;==
* Part One — The Mechanics of Movement: &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;The Inclined Plane&quot;, &quot;Levers&quot;, &quot;The Wheel and Axle&quot;, &quot;Gears and Belts&quot;, &quot;cams and Cranks&quot;, &quot;Pulleys&quot;, &quot;Screws&quot;, &quot;Rotating Wheels&quot;, &quot;Springs&quot;, &quot;Friction&quot;

<text>Agent Provocateur is the fifth studio album by the British-American rock band Foreigner, released on December 14, 1984. The album was the band&#x27;s only number-one album on the United Kingdom Albums Chart, and it reached the top five on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Although album sales were lower than their previous work in the US, it contains the band&#x27;s biggest hit single, the album’s love theme &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, which is their only #1 single on the UK singles chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, staying at the top spot for three and two weeks, respectively. The follow-up single, &quot;That Was Yesterday&quot;, also proved to be a sizeable hit, peaking at #12 in the US. The album was certified Platinum in the UK by the BPI, and triple Platinum in the US by the RIAA.

== Recording ==
Within nearly two years of releasing &quot;4&quot;, writing and preproduction for this album began as early as June 1983 in New York, with producer Trevor Horn. Then, once writing had been completed in September that year, official recording began in early October in New York with Horn. Eventually, things fell apart around the time of the Christmas holidays when Foreigner had joined him in England to resume the recording: Horn soon backed out of the project, feeling that he and the band were heading in different directions and that it was not going to work out. In hindsight, the band recognised that Horn&#x27;s production style wasn&#x27;t really suited to their music, according to drummer Dennis Elliott: &quot;he tried to make us more electronic than we wanted to be&quot;. Eventually, another month was spent trying to look for another producer to fill his shoes, subsequently hiring Alex Sadkin, who was busy finishing the Thompson Twins&#x27; &quot;Into the Gap&quot; album. Sadkin helped rekindle the project when it was on the verge of total collapse, but despite that, according to Jones, recording still never seemed to end: the sessions had been dogged from the very start and continued to remain unfocused. Sadkin agreed when reminiscing on the project in 1987:
Even though the extent of Horn&#x27;s contributions to the record is unclear, he claims to have done most of the backing tracks, including for &quot;I Want To Know What Love Is&quot;. According to singer Lou Gramm, owing to the difference in production styles between Sadkin and Horn, only two of the tracks that had been cut with the latter were kept on the record, though it is unclear which ones. A total of nine months had been spent on recording the album.
==Critical reception==

By the time of &quot;Agent Provocateur&quot;, Foreigner was frequently savaged by the contemporary rock music press. A review in &quot;Creem&quot; read: &quot;On this, their latest excursion into the gaping jaws of pulverizing mediocrity, our boys continue to wrestle with an all-too-turgid identity crisis — they still can&#x27;t decide whether it&#x27;s stupider to aspire to poor man&#x27;s Led Zep status or settle for being a weightier version of Chicago. Some swinging choice, huh? Either way they lose and this record is simply jammed with one dull defeat after another.&quot;

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Eduardo Rivadavia rated &quot;A Love in Vain&quot; as Foreigner&#x27;s fifth-most underrated song, calling it a &quot;synth-powered cry of desperation&quot; and a &quot;dark-horse favorite of fans.&quot; 

&quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Malcolm Dome rated two songs from &quot;Agent Provocateur&quot; as being among Foreigner&#x27;s 10 most underrated – &quot;Stranger in My Own House&quot; at #6 and &quot;Tooth and Nail&quot; – which he describes as &quot;the antidote to &#x27;I Want to Know What Love Is&#x27;&quot; – at #2.

&quot;Billboard&quot; said that in &quot;Tooth and Nail&quot; the band flex &quot;post-punk power chords with gusto.&quot;

<text>Marcel Beaubien (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003 and unsuccessfully sought election to the House of Commons of Canada as the Conservative candidate in the federal riding of Sarnia-Lambton in 2004.

==Background==
Beaubien was an insurance broker in private life, and served as President of the Sarnia United Way.

==Politics==
He began his political career at the municipal level, serving as a councillor in Petrolia, of which he later became mayor. He also served as a regional councillor for Lambton County.

He was elected to the Ontario legislature for the provincial riding of Lambton in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal candidate Larry O&#x27;Neill by over 4,000 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won the election, and Beaubien served as a government backbencher for the next four years. In 1995, Beaubien put pressure on the newly elected provincial government to intervene in the native protest at Ipperwash which culminated in the Ipperwash Crisis. From July 1995 to April 1997, Premier Mike Harris assigned him as the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. In 1998, he was responsible for a spearheading a government decision to deny Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) coverage to patients seeking sex-change operations.

In the provincial election of 1999, Beaubien defeated O&#x27;Neill again by fewer than 1,000 votes in the redistributed riding of Lambton—Kent—Middlesex. As before, he was not appointed to cabinet and served as a government backbencher. On April 25, 2002, newly minted Premier Ernie Eves appointed him to the position of parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Finance, Janet Ecker.

The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the provincial election of 2003, and Beaubien lost his seat to Liberal Maria Van Bommel by over 3,500 votes. The following year, he challenged long-serving Liberal MP Roger Gallaway in the federal riding of Sarnia—Lambton, and lost by over 5,000 votes.

<doc id="1254961" wikidata="Q223740" url="?curid=1254961" title="European Film Awards">
<text>The European Film Awards (or European Film Academy Awards) have been presented annually since 1988 by the European Film Academy to recognize excellence in European cinematic achievements. The awards are given in 19 categories, of which the most important is the Best Film. They are restricted to European cinema and European producers, directors and actors. The awards were officially also called the &quot;Felix Awards&quot; until 1997, in reference to the former award&#x27;s trophy statuette, which was replaced by a feminine statuette.

Since 1997, the European Film Awards have been held in early- to mid-December. Hosting duties have alternated between Berlin, Germany in odd-numbered years and other European cities in even-numbered years. The 33rd European Film Awards were held on 12 December 2020 as a virtual ceremony. In reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian films were excluded from the 2022 European Film Awards.

==Awarding procedures==
Feature films participating in the European Film Awards must be European feature-length fiction films intended for normal theatrical release which must have had their first official screening (be it at a festival or at a regular cinema) after 1 July of the year before.
Based on a selection of approximately 40 films recommended for a nomination, the members of the European Film Academy vote for the nominations in the main categories, which are announced in early November at the Seville European Film Festival. Based on the nominations, the members of the European Film Academy then vote for the winners which are announced at the European Film Awards Ceremony in early December.

==Eligibility==
The criteria whereby a film qualifies as European are based upon the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production, Appendix II, issued by the Council of Europe. This definition might be extended for Israeli and Palestinian works and nationalities. A cinematographic work qualifies as European if it achieves at least 16 points (out of 21).

The European Film Academy uses a lower minimum of 13 points.
==Host cities==

:European Capital of Culture event

Up through the 2018 ceremony, 15 cities in 10 countries have hosted the contest. Berlin has been host 14 times, Potsdam 3 times, and Paris 2 times. Barcelona, Bochum, Copenhagen, Glasgow, London, Riga, Rome, Seville, Tallinn, Valletta, Warsaw, and Wroclaw, have each hosted once.

<text>Inside Information is the sixth studio album by the British-American rock band Foreigner, released on December 7, 1987. 

== Debut and Release ==
The album debuted at 15, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Albums Chart and was certified Platinum in the U.S. for sales exceeding one million copies. Although a huge standard by any country&#x27;s charting method, the band&#x27;s sales were certainly plummeting since the release of &quot;4&quot; in 1981. It was the last album to feature the &#x27;80s core lineup of Gramm, Jones, Wills, and Elliott.

&quot;Say You Will&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single. Allmusic later noted that the single was a &quot;good example&quot; of the band&#x27;s &quot;balancing act&quot; as &quot;the guitar-heavy style of their early work gave way to slick arrangements that pushed electronics to the fore...temper(ing) its rock guitar edge...and Lou Gramm&#x27;s quasi-operatic vocals...by thick layers of chiming synthesizers and an array of electronic textures.&quot; The single reached #6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became their fourth #1 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, holding the top spot for four weeks. The song also became the band&#x27;s third-highest charting hit in Germany, where it reached #22, faring even better in Switzerland, the Netherlands, and particularly Norway, where it reached #4. The CD single featured an extended remix version of the track.

The second single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Live Without You&quot;, reached #5 on the Hot 100. Markedly softer than any of their work to date, the record was their first and only #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, after the more rousing ballads &quot;Waiting for a Girl Like You&quot; and &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot; had reached #5 and #3 on that chart respectively. Allmusic would later observe that while &quot;the end result lacked the distinctive rock touches of past Foreigner ballads, Lou Gramm contributes a lead vocal that avoids histrionics in favor of an emotional but very smooth delivery&quot; over &quot;washes of synthesizer...fleshed out by some meditative electric piano riffs&quot;. Nevertheless, the song charted at mainstream rock radio, where it peaked at #18. The #5 Hot 100 peak was their best showing in six singles, yet despite being followed up by more impassioned, up-tempo material it would be their last major pop hit to date.

The next single from the album was &quot;Heart Turns to Stone&quot;, which had peaked at #7 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in an earlier non-commercial release only to rock radio but only managed #56 on the Hot 100 several months later in 1988. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that even if &quot;Heart Turns to Stone&quot; could be called &quot;corporate rock&quot; the song works, and that &quot;what Foreigner loses in pure originality they gain in accessibility and clarity.&quot;

The following year saw a successful solo album and singles from Lou Gramm and found Mick Jones releasing an album and producing for artists including Billy Joel.

&quot;Out of the Blue&quot; was notable for being the only song in the band&#x27;s catalog to be credited to all four members from the classic 80&#x27;s lineup.

<text>James David Vaughan (December 14, 1864 – February 9, 1941) was an American music teacher, composer, song book publisher, the founder of the Vaughan Conservatory of Music and the James D. Vaughan Publishing Company.

==Biography==
Vaughan was born in Giles County, Tennessee, the son of George Washington and Eliza (Shores) Vaughan. He died February 9, 1941.

Vaughan is generally considered to be one of the founders of the genre now known as &quot;Southern gospel&quot; music. He started the James D. Vaughan Music Publishing Company in 1900 in Minor Hill, Tennessee, and in 1910 moved to Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. He taught shape note singing schools. He was the first to establish a professional quartet and put them on the road for the purpose of selling songbooks. The Vaughan School of Music was formed in 1911 in Lawrenceburg. Numerous gospel performers would study there in the following years. In 1912, Vaughan began the Vaughan Family Visitor, an influential publication across the South during the early 20th century.

In 1922, Vaughan founded one of the first radio stations in Tennessee, WOAN, where he broadcast Southern Gospel music until 1930. He also founded the first record company based in the South, Vaughan Phonograph Records. Vaughan was also involved in local politics, serving as mayor of Lawrenceburg from 1923 to 1927, a position his brother Charles Wesley and son would hold after him.

As one of the most significant figures in southern gospel music, James D. Vaughan was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1972 and the Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1997.

<text>A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream, Op. 64, is an opera with music by Benjamin Britten and set to a libretto adapted by the composer and Peter Pears from William Shakespeare&#x27;s play, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. It was premiered on 11 June 1960 at the Aldeburgh Festival, conducted by the composer and with set and costume designs by Carl Toms. Stylistically, the work is typical of Britten, with a highly individual sound-world – not strikingly dissonant or atonal, but replete with subtly atmospheric harmonies and tone painting. The role of Oberon was composed for the countertenor Alfred Deller. Atypically for Britten, the opera did not include a leading role for his partner Pears, who instead was given the comic drag role of Flute/Thisbe.

&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; was first performed on 11 June 1960 at the Jubilee Hall, Aldeburgh, UK as part of the Aldeburgh Festival. Conducted by the composer, it was directed by the choreographer John Cranko.

The work received wide critical approval following its early performances. Howard Taubman in his review of the Aldeburgh premiere wrote that the orchestral colors of the score conveyed a sense of &quot;soaring illusion&quot; that never wavered and concluded: 
Not every problem posed by Shakespeare has been solved, but Mr. Britten has accomplished so much that one may safely predict a wide vogue for his latest and happiest opera.

A dissenting voice was Britten&#x27;s estranged collaborator W. H. Auden. In a letter to Stephen Spender after seeing the 1961 London production, Auden dismissed it as &quot;Dreadful! Pure Kensington&quot;.

&quot;Dream&quot; was performed at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1961, produced by John Gielgud and conducted by Georg Solti. This production was revived six times to 1984.

The English Music Theatre Company staged the opera at Snape Maltings in 1980, directed by Christopher Renshaw and designed by Robin Don; the production was revived at the Royal Opera House for one performance in 1986.

In 2005, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, produced a version directed by Olivia Fuchs at the Linbury Studio Theatre with the Tiffin Boys&#x27; Choir. William Towers was Oberon, and Gillian Keith Tytania.

English National Opera&#x27;s production of 2011, directed by Christopher Alden, set the opera in a mid-20th-century school, with Oberon (Iestyn Davies) and Tytania (Anna Christy) as teachers and Puck and the fairies as schoolboys. Oberon&#x27;s relationship with Puck (Jamie Manton) is given overtly sexual overtones, and Puck responds with alternate anger and despair to Oberon&#x27;s new-found interest in Tytania&#x27;s Changeling boy. The silent older man who stalks the action in the first two acts is revealed to be Theseus (Paul Whelan); reviewers have suggested that in this staging Theseus himself was once the object of Oberon&#x27;s attentions, and is either watching history repeating itself, or is in fact daydreaming the magical events of the opera prior to his marriage to Hippolyta.

Baz Luhrmann directed a music video of an arrangement of &quot;Now Until the Break of Day&quot; from the finale of act 3 for his 1998 album &quot;Something for Everybody&quot; featuring Christine Anu and David Hobson.

==Analysis==
Britten delineated the three tiers of characters, the rustics being given folk-like &quot;simple&quot; music, the lovers a more romantic sound-world and the fairies being represented in a very ethereal way. Almost all of the action now takes place in the woods around Athens, and the fairies inhabit a much more prominent place in the drama. The comic performance by the rustics of &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot; at the final wedding takes on an added dimension as a parody of nineteenth-century Italian opera. Thisbe&#x27;s lament, accompanied by obbligato flute, is a parody of a Donizetti &quot;mad scene&quot; (&quot;Il dolce suono&quot;).

The opera contains several innovations: it is extremely rare in opera that the lead male role is written for the countertenor voice to sing. The part of Oberon was created by Alfred Deller. Britten wrote specifically for his voice, which, despite its ethereal quality, had a low range compared to more modern countertenors. Oberon&#x27;s music almost never requires the countertenor to sing both at the top of the alto range and &quot;forte&quot;.

The plot of the opera follows that of the play, with several alterations. Most of Shakespeare&#x27;s act 1 is cut, compensated for by the opera&#x27;s only added line: &quot;Compelling thee to marry with Demetrius.&quot; Therefore, much greater precedence is given to the wood, and to the fairies. This is also indicated by the opening &quot;portamenti&quot; strings, and by the ethereal countertenor voice that is Oberon, the male lead, who throughout is accompanied by a characteristic texture of harp and celeste, in the same way that Puck&#x27;s appearance is heralded by the combination of trumpet and snare-drum.

The opera opens with a chorus, &quot;Over hill, over dale&quot; from Tytania&#x27;s attendant fairies, played by boy sopranos. Other highlights include Oberon&#x27;s florid – the exotic celeste is especially notable – aria,&quot;I know a bank&quot; (inspired by Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Sweeter than roses&quot;, which Britten had previously arranged for Pears to sing), Tytania&#x27;s equally florid &quot;Come now, a roundel&quot;, the chorus&#x27;s energetic &quot;You spotted snakes&quot;, the hilarious comedy of &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;, and the final trio for Oberon, Tytania and the chorus.

 The introduction of a chorus of boy-fairies means that the opera becomes greatly concerned with the theme of purity. It is these juvenile fairies who eventually quell the libidinous activities of the quartet of lovers, as they sing a beautiful melody on the three &quot;motto chords&quot; (also on the four &quot;magic&quot; chords) of the second act: &quot;Jack shall have Jill/Naught shall go ill/The man shall have his mare again/And all shall be well.&quot; Sung by boys, it could be considered that this goes beyond irony, and represents an idealised vision of a paradise of innocence and purity that Britten seems to have been captivated by throughout his life.

Britten also pays attention to the play&#x27;s central motif: the madness of love. Curiously he took the one relationship in the play that is grotesque (that of Tytania and Bottom) and placed it in the centre of his opera (in the middle of act 2). Women in Britten operas tend to run to extremes, being either predators or vulnerable prey, but Tytania is an amalgam; she dominates Bottom, but is herself completely dominated by Oberon and Puck, the couple that are usually considered to really hold power in The Dream. Their cruel pranks eventually quell her coloratura, which until she is freed from the power of the love-juice is fiendishly difficult to sing.

Britten also parodied operatic convention in less obvious ways than &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;. Like many other operas, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; opens with a chorus, but it is a chorus of unbroken boys&#x27; voices, singing in unison. After this comes the entrance of the prima donna and the male lead, who is as far away as possible from Wagner&#x27;s heldentenors, and as close as it is possible to get to Handel&#x27;s castrati of the 18th century.: &quot;There is an air of baroque fantasy in the music.&quot; Britten&#x27;s treatment of Puck also suggests parody. In opera, the hero&#x27;s assistant is traditionally sung by baritones, yet here we have an adolescent youth who speaks, rather than sings.

Britten thought the character of Puck &quot;absolutely amoral and yet innocent.&quot; Describing the speaking, tumbling Puck of the opera, Britten wrote &quot;I got the idea of doing Puck like this in Stockholm, where I saw some Swedish child acrobats with extraordinary agility and powers of mimicry, and suddenly realised we could do Puck this way.&quot;

==Recordings==
There are many recordings available, including two conducted by the composer, one a live recording of the 11 June 1960 premiere with the complete original cast, the second a studio recording made in 1967 with some of the original cast, Deller as Oberon, Owen Brannigan as Bottom, and Peter Pears elevated from Flute to Lysander, which omits some music from the lovers&#x27; awakening early in act 3.

<text>Emiliano Mercado del Toro (August 21, 1891 – January 24, 2007) was a Puerto Rican supercentenarian and military veteran who was, at age 115, the world&#x27;s oldest person following the death of 116-year-old Elizabeth Bolden on December 11, 2006, until his own death on January 24, 2007. He had already been the world&#x27;s oldest man from November 19, 2004, upon the death of Fred Harold Hale. At the time of his death in January 2007, aged 115 years and 156 days, Mercado was the second oldest fully validated male ever, behind Danish-American Christian Mortensen&#x27;s record of 115 years 252 days. Japanese man, Shigechiyo Izumi, was still believed to be older at the time of Mercado&#x27;s death, but his record was withdrawn by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in 2010.

==Biography==
Emiliano (known to his family as &quot;Emilio&quot;) was born in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico (at a time when Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony), the son of Delfín Mercado Cáceres and Gumercinda del Toro Padilla. Emiliano worked in the cane fields until the age of 81. He never married and never had children, but said he had three &quot;girlfriends&quot; (love interests) in his life.

===Accolades===
Mercado first came to the attention of longevity researchers in 2001, after a story about a 110-year-old veteran in a parade in Puerto Rico. Researchers tried to track him down, but no documents were forthcoming until after the November 2004 death of Fred Harold Hale. By January 2005, Guinness had accepted Mercado as the oldest living man.

Mercado was 27 years old in October 1918 when he was drafted into the U.S. Army to serve in World War I. He was still at a training camp in Panama when the November 11, 1918 armistice was declared. He later became the longest-lived veteran of any military force, exceeding the previous oldest veteran, Antonio Todde.

In 1993, he was honored by U.S. President Bill Clinton with the medal commemorating the 75th anniversary of the signing of the truce that ended World War I. Mercado del Toro, the elder of two siblings, had to move from his familiar Cabo Rojo grounds due to a fall he had in his home when he was 102, which affected his hipbone. His 85-year-old niece took him to live with his relatives, and he was well taken care of by nieces and nephews - and their families, who called him &quot;Tío Millo&quot; (&quot;Uncle Millo&quot;)- at their home in Isabela.

The mayor of Isabela, Puerto Rico said a home for the elderly would be renamed in his honor.

===Later life===
Mercado could reminisce about being a child when U.S. troops invaded Puerto Rico in 1898, and he clearly remembered the fighting that marked the end of Spain&#x27;s colonial empire in the Americas. He credited his longevity to &quot;funche&quot;, a boiled corn, codfish and milk cream-like dish, which he ate every day as a habit.

His last two birthdays were media events in the town of Isabela. Civic leaders and veterans commended Mercado on his endurance and lucid mind, but the &quot;gift&quot; he would enjoy the most was the visit of Puerto Rican &quot;vedette&quot; and media icon Iris Chacón. In an interview, Mercado claimed to be a great fan of the artist, and particularly of her derrière (&quot;That rump was something serious!&quot;, he was quoted as saying). Chacón visited Mercado, who, although he could barely see or hear by the time of his 114th birthday, was pleased with her visit. His photo touching Chacón&#x27;s rear end, with a big smile on his face, made newspaper headlines in Puerto Rico. She returned the following year to greet him. After hearing news of Mercado&#x27;s death, Chacón was quoted as saying: &quot;I feel like I&#x27;ve lost my own grandfather. I was blessed for knowing him, knowing that I made him happy, and blessed for the anecdotes and wishes he told me the times I met him. His wisdom is something I learned a lot from. His life is an example of how you&#x27;re supposed to live your life, happily and doing good, for it will give you longevity and goodwill from everyone.&quot;

He was buried at Cementerio Municipal San Martín de Porres of his native town of Cabo Rojo, with mayors, legislators, fellow veterans and Puerto Rican &quot;vedette&quot; Iris Chacón in attendance. After his death, Emma Tillman took over as the world&#x27;s oldest person and Tomoji Tanabe took over as the world&#x27;s oldest man.

<text>Aldine Silliman Kieffer (August 1, 1840 – November 30, 1904) was a leading 19th century proponent of shape note musical notation, music teacher and publisher.

Kieffer was born near Miami, Saline County, Missouri. He died in Dayton, Virginia, and is buried there.

Kieffer was the grandson of Mennonite musician Joseph Funk. After Funk&#x27;s death, he and Ephraim Ruebush took over Funk&#x27;s publishing company. With Ruebush and John W. Howe, Kieffer founded the Kieffer, Ruebush, &amp; Company music company circa 1873, which was moved from Singers Glen to Dayton, Virginia, in 1878. Kieffer was editor of the &quot;Musical Million and Fireside Friend&quot; periodical. The &quot;Musical Million&quot;, published from 1870 until 1914, was one of the leading tools promoting shape note music for almost a half century. It helped link teachers and students across the country, and published many songs in its pages.

Kieffer taught singing schools and used his songbooks in the schools. One of Kieffer&#x27;s most popular song books was &quot;The Temple Star&quot;, published at Singer&#x27;s Glen in 1877. One of his most popular songs was his poem &quot;Twilight is Stealing&quot;, set to music by B. C. Unseld in 1877 and published in the Temple Star.

<text>Warner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment, Inc. (doing business as Warner Bros. Home Entertainment; formerly known as Warner Home Video and WCI Home Video and sometimes credited as Warner Home Entertainment) is the American home video distribution division of Warner Bros. Discovery.

It was founded in 1978 as WCI Home Video (as a division of Warner Communications, Inc.). The company launched in the United States with twenty films on Betamax and VHS videocassettes in late 1979. The company later expanded its line to include additional titles throughout 1979 and 1980.

It is responsible for distributing the film and television library of Warner Bros. Discovery and other companies on various home media formats, such as DVD, Blu-ray, Ultra HD Blu-ray, Digital, and streaming platforms. Some of the companies that Warner Bros. Home Entertainment distributes include Max, Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, Warner Bros. Television Studios, Warner Bros. Animation, Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, DC Entertainment, DC Studios, Viz Media, HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, TBS, TNT, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, Rooster Teeth (until its closure in May 2024 and purchase by co-founder Burnie Burns&#x27;s company Box Canyon Productions in February 2025), Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, TLC, HGTV, Food Network, and Amazon MGM Studios (via MGM Home Entertainment) among others.

Their releases are currently distributed by Studio Distribution Services, a joint venture between WBDHE and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.

== History ==

The company was founded in 1978 and launched in the United States with twenty films on Betamax and VHS videocassettes in late 1979. The company later expanded its line to include additional titles throughout 1979 and 1980.

Warner Bros. began to branch out into the videodisc market, licensing titles to MCA DiscoVision and RCA&#x27;s SelectaVision videodisc formats, allowing both companies to market and distribute the films under their labels. By 1985, Warner was releasing material under their own label in both formats. Titles from Warner Home Video were and continue to be distributed and manufactured by Roadshow Home Video worldwide except for Australia and New Zealand because of its film counterpart&#x27;s films released by Village Roadshow.

Warner also experimented with the &quot;rental-only&quot; market for videos, a method also used by 20th Century Fox for their first release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in 1982. Two known films released in this manner were &quot;Superman II&quot; and &quot;Excalibur&quot;. Other films released for rental use include &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;, &quot;The Enforcer&quot;, &quot;Prince of the City&quot;, and &quot;Sharky&#x27;s Machine&quot;. In 1990, Warner Home Video acquired the worldwide home video rights to the MGM/UA catalog. The $125 million purchase was used to finance MGM/UA&#x27;s acquisition by the Pathé Communications Corporation. The intended 12½-year-long deal was cut short in February 2000, with MGM paying Warner Home Video $225 million to regain video rights to a number of its films. In exchange, Warner Home Video gained full control over the video rights to MGM&#x27;s pre-May 1986 library, an asset the studio had acquired outright from Turner Entertainment Co., but due to a pre-existing licensing deal with MGM, was originally expected to expire in 2001.

On December 20, 1996, Warner Home Video was one of the first major American distributors for the then-new DVD format, by releasing the films &quot;Assassins&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, &quot;Eraser&quot;, and &quot;The Fugitive&quot; on DVD in Japan and on March 24, 1997, in the United States with &quot;Blade Runner&quot; also being a launch title for the region there. Warner Bros. executive Warren Lieberfarb is often seen as &quot;the father of DVD&quot;. Lieberfarb&#x27;s successor, Warner Bros. executive James F. Cardwell was recognized in paving the way for WHV&#x27;s strategic positioning in next generation technologies such as High Definition DVD (HD DVD), electronic sell-through and portable video. In 2003, Warner Home Video became the first home video releasing company to release movies only on DVD with no VHS equivalent.
In 2009, Warner Home Video introduced the Warner Archive Collection, which allows the public to order custom-made DVDs of rarely seen films and TV series from the Warner and Turner libraries. The films are also available as digital downloads. Warner Archive DVDs and downloads can be ordered online on Warner&#x27;s website, on Amazon.com or one-time Turner Classic Movies-affiliated DVD website MoviesUnlimited.com.

On June 30, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment regained the home video rights to the MGM catalog after 21 years.

Starting in 2022, due to the finalization of the Warner Bros. Discovery merger, WBHE started distributing the television libraries of Discovery-owned networks including the flagship Discovery Channel and Animal Planet.

=== Studio Distribution Services, LLC ===
On January 14, 2020, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment and Universal Pictures Home Entertainment announced that they would partner on a 10-year multinational joint-venture. In North America, their physical distribution operations were merged into a company named Studio Distribution Services, LLC. Internationally, Universal will distribute Warner Bros.&#x27; titles in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan; while Warner will distribute Universal&#x27;s titles in the United Kingdom (until 2025), Italy (until 2024) and Benelux. On April 7, 2020, the European Commission approved the merger. Since June 1, 2021, SDS&#x27; logo took the WBHE logo&#x27;s place on the back covers of the home releases; while there have been several exceptions that had the WBHE logo in place, mainly manufactured on demand titles including 4K (also steelbooks) and Blu-ray releases. It is unknown whenever SDS uses an on-screen logo; as Warner releases by SDS use the 2017–present Warner Bros. Home Entertainment logo.

On June 24, 2024, it was reported that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment had entered into a distribution deal with SDS to handle the physical distribution of titles from Sony Pictures (Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Screen Gems, Crunchyroll, LLC, etc.) as well as those from Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (Walt Disney Pictures, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm Ltd., 20th Century Studios, etc.), Lionsgate Home Entertainment (Lionsgate Films, Summit Entertainment, eOne Films, Roadside Attractions, etc.) and The Criterion Collection through their existing distribution deals with SPHE.

<text>Unusual Heat is the seventh studio album by British-American rock band Foreigner, released in June 1991, by Atlantic Records. Recorded at several different studios across the state of New York and England, and produced by Terry Thomas and Mick Jones, it was the only album with lead singer Johnny Edwards. He replaced original lead singer Lou Gramm. Edwards, a veteran singer who&#x27;d done a tour of duty with Montrose and was then the frontman for another Atlantic act, Wild Horses. As Edwards told UCR in a separate interview, Wild Horses had only just signed its record deal — and although joining for Foreigner was obviously tempting for financial reasons if nothing else, he was reluctant to walk away from his own band after struggling for years to make it on his own terms.

Jones, however, was undeterred—and eager to work with a singer most fans hadn&#x27;t heard of rather than hiring a big-name replacement who&#x27;d come with his own baggage. &quot;We were in rehearsal and talks with a couple of guys who were both strong candidates and had kind of a name,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I felt eventually that it was probably going to be better to not try and put an all-star band together, but to keep on the same kind of path with four people being involved in making a record and not really, I think I would probably say, cheapening the band at that point—cheapening the meaning and the direction of the band.&quot;
&quot;Unusual Heat&quot; was a commercial failure, only peaking at number 117 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart – a sharp decline in sales comparing with all previous albums, all of which reached the Top 20 and became at least Platinum. Neither of the two singles released from the album charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with &quot;Lowdown and Dirty&quot; only charting on the Mainstream Rock chart at #4.

The original version of the song &quot;Ready for the Rain&quot;, demoed by the Sacramento, CA based band Northrup in the late 1980s with Johnny Edwards on lead vocals, was finally released in 2001 by Metal Mayhem Music as part of a collection of demos under the name JK Northrup.

<doc id="1255024" wikidata="Q7739284" url="?curid=1255024" title="The Hebrew Hammer (film)">
<text>The Hebrew Hammer is a 2003 American comedy film written and directed by Jonathan Kesselman. It stars Adam Goldberg, Judy Greer, Andy Dick, Mario Van Peebles, and Peter Coyote. The plot concerns a Jewish crime fighter known as the &quot;Hebrew Hammer&quot; who must save Hanukkah from the evil son of Santa Claus, who wants to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and make everyone celebrate Christmas.

The film parodies blaxploitation films, and features Melvin Van Peebles in a cameo appearance as &quot;Sweetback&quot;.

==Plot==
The film begins with a flashback to a young Mordechai Jefferson Carver. At school, Mordechai is tormented by his fellow students and his teacher for being a Jewish child in a public school predominantly attended by Christians, and for celebrating Hanukkah while everyone else celebrates Christmas. Although his teacher encourages her students to respect Mordechai for who he is, he feels further alienated as he walks through his neighborhood and sees a seemingly endless number of Christmas decorations and window displays celebrating the holiday and announcing that Jews aren&#x27;t welcome. As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying &quot;Jews &#x27;OK&#x27; (for about 5 minutes)&quot; and spins his dreidel to cheer himself up, Santa Claus walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives Mordechai the finger.

The scene then changes to the present with Mordechai as the Hebrew Hammer, a certified circumcised &quot;dick&quot; who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a Hasidic Jew) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the white Christians over the previous few decades because the current Santa (the son of the cruel Santa who stomped Mordechai&#x27;s dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance. This Santa is murdered and replaced by his son, Damian, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, thus reserving December for Christmas alone. Mordechai is reluctantly recruited to stop Damian, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front&#x27;s leader Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim.

The fight takes them to exotic locales such as Israel, K-Mart, the Jewish Atomic Clock outside Jerusalem and the final battle at the North Pole.

==Cast==
* Adam Goldberg as Mordechai Jefferson Carver / The Hebrew Hammer
** Grant Rosenmeyer as young Mordechai
* Judy Greer as Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal
* Andy Dick as Damian Claus
* Mario Van Peebles as Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim
* Peter Coyote as Jewish Justice League Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal
* Nora Dunn as Mrs. Carver
* Sean Whalen as Tiny Tim
* Tony Cox as Jamal
* Richard Riehle as Santa
* Melvin Van Peebles as Sweetback
* Rachel Dratch as Tikva
* Harrison Chad as Schlomo
* Annie McEnroe as Mrs. Highsmith
* Elaine Hendrix as Blonde bombshell
* Ed Koch as himself
* Jimmy Walsh as Freckle-Faced Gentile
* Jason Fuchs as Adolescent Hasidic Boy

==Controversy==
&quot;The Hebrew Hammer&quot; parodies many common stereotypes about Jews. During filming, the movie came to the attention of the Anti-Defamation League, which were concerned that it might promote unfavorable images of Jews; the film happens to include a direct parody of the ADL as members of the fictional Jewish Justice League. After viewing the film, Warren Katz of the ADL brought legal action against the producers of the film but lost in a summary ruling handed down by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The film also drew criticism from some Christian groups, who argued that the film portrayed most Christians as being anti-Semitic and intolerant.

Many scenes were shot in Borough Park, Brooklyn, which has a large community of Hasidic Jews. Filmmakers were initially concerned that members of the Hasidic community might protest the movie, as they did with the 1998 film &quot;A Price Above Rubies&quot;, and shut down filming. The reaction of the Hasidim in Borough Park was mixed, however. No organized protest was pursued, and some residents of the neighborhood agreed to appear as extras in the film.

==Reception==
The film received a rating of 52% on aggregate review site Rotten Tomatoes.

==Sequel==
In 2017, plans for a sequel titled &quot;The Hebrew Hammer Vs. Hitler&quot; were announced. The sequel will be funded in part by crowd funding. It will begin in the present day, with the Hammer coming out of retirement to fight the increase in racism brought on by Donald Trump&#x27;s election. He does this by going back in time to fight the worst source of antisemitism in the 20th century.

<doc id="1255030" wikidata="Q1387320" url="?curid=1255030" title="Snowskate">
<text>A snowskate is a snow sliding device which can be described as a hybrid of a snowboard, and a skateboard. Unlike a snowboard which uses bindings to secure the board to a riders feet, a snowskate is typically bindingless. The lack of bindings allows the rider to perform more skateboard-like flip tricks on the snow as opposed to what can be done on a traditional snowboard. Although the bindingless nature of the snowskate allows for the aforementioned skateboard-like tricks, snowskates can also be ridden in a style similar to traditional snowboarding, but with the added challenge and freedom of riding and carving bindingless. There are many types of snowskates depending on the brand and styling of riding, but the most common are single deck and bi-level snowskates.

== Single deck snowskate ==
Single deck snowskates are usually made out of laminated wood with a plastic bottom or are made of solid plastic, There are grooves cut into the bottom of the board, usually 7 or 5. Single decks are preferred for riding in snowskate parks and urban terrain but can also be ridden down hills, however, they are rarely permitted on ski resorts. Snowskates of this kind are most suitable for winter skateboarding tricks.

Single deck snowskates first appeared on the market in 1998, manufactured by Premier Snowskates and marketed by Andy Wolf, former member of the Nitro snowboarding team. Today the primary manufacturers are: Ambition Snowskates, Hovland Snowskates, LY Snow and Krown Skateboards.

Snowskate parks became numerous when the first single deck snowskates were being sold in stores. Word of mouth quickly spread about the single deck snowskate, leading to the popularity of snowskate parks around United States.

The snowskate park moved snowskating from an urban underground winter sport to a mainstream winter sport. With the introduction of the snowboard, many resorts have removed their snowskate parks, and snowskating has moved back to its underground winter sport roots.

== Bi-level snowskate ==

A bi-level snowskate, also called a bideck, or snowdeck, is a snowskate that has a skateboard top-deck which the rider stands on, connected through a set of &quot;trucks&quot; to a ski sub-deck, which is in contact with the snow. While few, if any, mountain ski resorts permit single deck snowskate riders on ski lifts, riders of bi-level snowskates which feature a leash to prevent runaway and a metal edged sub-deck are permitted on ski lifts in many mountain resorts such as Vail in Colorado. With no bindings and no special boots needed, a snowskate can be the most affordable way to shred your local hill or mountain.

Bi-level snowskates were reportedly invented by a Stevens Pass (Washington) local named Steve Frink. He came up with the idea of a skateboard with skis in 1994 while burning his skateboard in a skateboarders&#x27; ritual. In the year 2001, after many prototypes, he completed a final and finished product which he marketed under the brand &quot;Bi-Deck Snowskates&quot;. Around the same time, snowboard manufacturer Burton Snowboards released the &quot;Snowdeck&quot;. Burton has since stopped making snowskates.

The World Championships of Snowskating was held on April 20, 2024 at Solheisen in Hemsedal, Norway with 40 competitors representing 8 countries: Norway, Sweden, Germany, Lichtenstein, El Salvador, USA, Canada, and South Africa.

Bi-level snowskates differ depending on the style of riding with longer sub-decks favored for speed and carving and shorter sub-decks favored for tricks and stunts. Some current bi-level snowskate manufacturers are Hovland, Draw Snowskates, Parole Boards, Squampton Snowskates (eco-friendly, made with hemp), Harfang, Ralston, Pioneer, Fuse, florilda powderskate, 0910, Minus-7, Landyachtz, Chiller, LibTech and Boyd Hill. A complete list can be found at ItsASnowskate.Com 

== Less Common Snowskates ==

=== 4x4 snowskate ===
The least common snowskate, 4x4 snowskates, provide the most skateboard like feel. They have four small skis, each replacing a wheel, and are generally very similar to average skateboards.

=== Powderskate ===
Powderskates are the most surf-like snowskate. They are usually longer and have a larger surface area to keep the rider afloat as it is used in deep powder. There are two varieties; single and bi-deck. The single deck is only for use in powder, and provides the most surf-like feel, whereas the bi-level snowskates provides more leverage, and can be used on and off the powder.

== History and design ==
The first snowskate traces its history to the Snurfer circa 1964. The Snurfer is considered to be the first snowboard to ever hit the market, but it could arguably be called the first snowskate, since it was without bindings. Joshua Luther first coined the phrase snowskate when he needed a way to get across town during a blizzard.

Around 1970, a product called the &quot;Snow Skate&quot; was sold in local toy and sporting good stores. They resembled the modern day Fuse snowskate. There were two ski-like apparatuses that were attached to the area around the truck of a skateboard, allowing the skateboard to move through the snow. The &quot;Ski&quot; portion of the snow skate is made of a hard plastic with rubber straps that went over the skateboard wheels to hold them together. Other mentionable early snowskate brands were The &quot;Skeeter&quot; and the &quot;Snodad&quot;. Designs of this early era ranged from two skiblades on the lower deck (Like the Skeeter) to four blades on the lower deck. Sometimes, the early snowskates used metal runners, similar to ice skate blades, enabling the snowskater to use the momentum to ride well.

The &quot;Snodad&quot; came about much later in time. It was created by PNW skaters with the intent of riding fresh snow without bindings. Unfortunately the demise of the company came shortly after its official launch. It exists only as a historical &quot;tip of the hat&quot; to these pioneers of snowboarding without bindings.

<doc id="1255031" wikidata="Q431363" url="?curid=1255031" title="Society of Experimental Test Pilots">
<text>The Society of Experimental Test Pilots is an international organization that seeks to promote air safety and contributes to aeronautical advancement by promoting sound aeronautical design and development; interchanging ideas, thoughts and suggestions of the members, assisting in the professional development of experimental pilots, and providing scholarships and aid to members and the families of deceased members.

==History==
Seventeen pilots attended the first organized meeting of the &quot;Testy Test Pilots Society&quot; on September 29, 1955. This name was to be short-lived, however, as it was changed to The Society of Experimental Test Pilots at the second meeting on October 13, 1955.

The first officers of the society were instated on October 25, 1955, and consisted of Ray Tenhoff, President; Scott Crossfield, Executive Adviser; Dick Johnson, Vice-President; Joe Ozier, Secretary; Lou Everett, Treasurer; and Al Blackburn, Legal Officer. Once the organization and bylaws were established, the society incorporated in the state of California on April 12, 1956. The insigne of the society was designed by C. A. &quot;Al&quot; McDaniel and officially adopted for use in 1956.

The first Awards Banquet was held on October 4, 1957, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. It was at the second such banquet, however, that the tradition of the Iven C. Kincheloe Award began. This annual award honors the member who has done the most proficient test work during the previous year. James Gannett of Boeing and Joseph John &quot;Tym&quot; Tymczyszyn of the Civil Aeronautics Administration won the first Kincheloe Award for their work toward certification of America&#x27;s first turbojet airliner&#x27; the Boeing 707. They have been followed each year by the most notable contributors to aviation history.

In 1969, Bob Hoover was president of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP), and he had been a personal friend of Charles Lindbergh since the early 1950s, when the reclusive Lindbergh was using the pseudonym &quot;Mr Schwartz&quot;. Hoover persuaded Lindbergh to attend the SETP annual symposium and banquet at the Beverley Hilton, as his guest. At the top table, they were joined by Neil Armstrong, who had just been released from quarantine after the Apollo 11 mission. Hoover introduced both Lindbergh and Armstrong, to the surprise of the press and other attendees, and many photos were published of Hoover&#x27;s wife Colleen flanked by both &#x27;heroes&#x27; of aviation. The story of the occasion was later narrated by Hoover in the 2014 documentary film &quot;Flying the Feathered Edge: The Bob Hoover Project&quot;.

<text>George Guy Weadick (February 23, 1885 – December 13, 1953) was an American cowboy, performer and promoter. He and his horse Cyclone quickly became well known in the Calgary area. Today, he is best known as the founder of the Calgary Stampede in Alberta, Canada. He was married to famed cowgirl, Florence LaDue. Weadick was the first to be inducted in the Builder category in the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame.

== Calgary Stampede ==
In 1912, Weadick travelled to Calgary, where he met with H.C. McMullen, a livestock agent for the Canadian Pacific Railway. The two of them put together a program for a frontier show. They envisioned a cowboy championship along with a tribute to the Old West. Weadick gained financing from the Big Four: George Lane, owner of the Bar U Ranch; two other wealthy ranchers, Patrick Burns and A. E. Cross; and A. J. McLean, provincial secretary. He staged the first Calgary Stampede September 2–7, 1912, when ranchers and farmers had finished the harvesting and would be free to attend.

Weadick arranged for 200 head of Mexican steers, 200 bucking steers, and wild horses to be brought in from the ranches around Calgary. In order to entice top quality competitors, $20,000 in championship money and world championship titles were offered. The prize money was about four times the closest competition, causing riders from across North America to arrive in the 1912 Stampede. In 1919, Weadick and Calgary Industrial Exhibition manager, E. L. Richardson, agreed to combine the rodeo events with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition and, in 1923, Weadick and Richardson co-founded the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede as an annual event.

In 1912, Indigenous peoples were not allowed to celebrate their cultures on their own reserves because of Indian Act laws and regulations. The Stampede was one of the only places they were welcomed to participate and celebrate their traditions publicly because of a special agreement Guy Weadick and the Calgary Stampede made with the government.
Indian Village is organized by volunteers on the Stampede&#x27;s Indian Events committee, Stampede employees and the tipi families who camp at the Village during the Stampede.
There is constant consultation about the name of the Village and if it should be changed. The tipi owners have indicated that Indian Village is a place and a name with great historical significance and honours the role of Guy Weadick and the relationship with the Stampede throughout the 20th century.

== Later years ==
Following on the success of the Calgary Stampede, Guy Weadick continued promoting his own personal Old West shows (outside Calgary). He continued running the Stampede for 20 years after its initial creation. His next appearance at the Stampede was to appear in the parade in 1952. He died on December 13, 1953. The Calgary Stampede Guy Weadick Award, created in 1969, was named after him. He was inducted into the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame in the Builder category on July 12, 1982. He was inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in 1976.

<doc id="1255050" wikidata="Q1099560" url="?curid=1255050" title="Mr. Moonlight (album)">
<text>Mr. Moonlight is the eighth studio album by British-American rock band Foreigner, released by Arista Records in Europe on 24 October and by BMG Entertainment in Japan on 23 November 1994. In the United States and Canada, it appeared in early 1995 on the Rhythm Safari label. Recorded at seven different studios across the States, the album was produced by Mick Jones, Lou Gramm, and Mike Stone, with an additional production by Phil and Joe Nicolo. It was Foreigner&#x27;s last studio release until &quot;Can&#x27;t Slow Down&quot; (2009).

The album was the first since &quot;Inside Information&quot; (1987) and the last to feature original lead singer Lou Gramm. Prior to starting work on &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot;, he was the lead vocalist on three newly recorded tracks from Foreigner&#x27;s compilation &quot;The Very Best ... and Beyond&quot; (1992). &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; was also the first album in fifteen years without bass guitarist Rick Wills, who joined the band in 1979, and drummer Dennis Elliott, who was a founding member.

Though it was intended to be a comeback release, &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; was a commercial disappointment, only peaking at number 136 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and ranked as Foreigner&#x27;s worst-selling studio album.

<doc id="1255054" wikidata="Q5488233" url="?curid=1255054" title="Frank Mazzilli">
<text>Frank Mazzilli (born December 7, 1962) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2003.

==Background==
Mazzilli has a diploma from the Ontario Police College, and worked as a member of the police force in London, Ontario from 1982 to 1999.

==Politics==
In the federal election of 1997, he ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the riding of London West, but lost to Liberal Sue Barnes by almost 14,000 votes.

He was elected to the Ontario legislature for the riding of London—Fanshawe in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Peter Mancini and New Democrat Irene Mathyssen in a close three-way race. In 2002, he served as a co-chair of the Ontario Crime Control Commission.

The Progressive Conservatives had lost much of their urban support by the time of the 2003 provincial election, and Mazzilli dropped to a third-place finish in London—Fanshawe against Mathyssen and the winner, Liberal Khalil Ramal.

His younger brother John Mazzilli ran unsuccessfully for the Conservative Party of Canada in both the 2004 and 2006 federal elections. Frank worked both times as his campaign co-chairman.

<doc id="1255059" wikidata="Q1427967" url="?curid=1255059" title="Manual therapy">
<text>Manual therapy, or manipulative therapy, is a treatment primarily used by physical therapists and occupational therapists to treat musculoskeletal pain and disability. It mostly includes kneading and manipulation of muscles, joint mobilization and joint manipulation. It is also used by Rolfers, massage therapists, athletic trainers, osteopaths, and physicians.

== Definitions ==

Irvin Korr, J. S. Denslow and colleagues did the original body of research on manual therapy. Korr described it as the &quot;Application of an accurately determined and specifically directed manual force to the body, in order to improve mobility in areas that are restricted; in joints, in connective tissues or in skeletal muscles.&quot;

According to the &quot;Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapy Description of Advanced Specialty Practice&quot; manual therapy is defined as a clinical approach utilizing specific hands-on techniques, including but not limited to manipulation/mobilization, used by the physical therapist to diagnose and treat soft tissues and joint structures for the purpose of modulating pain; increasing range of motion (ROM); reducing or eliminating soft tissue inflammation; inducing relaxation; improving contractile and non-contractile tissue repair, extensibility, and/or stability; facilitating movement; and improving function.

A consensus study of US chiropractors defined manual therapy (generally known as the &quot;chiropractic adjustment&quot; in the profession) as &quot;Procedures by which the hands directly contact the body to treat the articulations and/or soft tissues.&quot;

== Use and method ==

In Pakistan, Western Europe, North America and Australasia, manual therapy is usually practiced by members of specific health care professions (e.g. Chiropractors, Occupational Therapists, Osteopaths, Osteopathic physicians, Physiotherapists/Physical Therapists, Massage Therapists and Physiatrists). However, some lay practitioners (not members of a structured profession), such as bonesetters also provide some forms of manual therapy.

A survey released in May 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health focused on who used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), what was used, and why it was used in the United States by adults during 2002. Massage was the fifth most commonly use CAM in the United States in 2007.

=== Techniques ===
* Myofascial therapy targets the muscle and fascial systems, promotes flexibility and mobility of the body&#x27;s connective tissues. It is said to mobilize adhesions and reduce severity/sensitivity of scarring. A critical analysis finds that the relevance of fascia to therapy doubtful.
* Massage may be used as part of a treatment. Proponents claim this may reduce inflammation. Science writer Paul Ingraham notes that there is no evidence to support the claim.
* Friction massage is said to increase mobilization of adhesions between fascial layers, muscles, compartments and other soft tissues. They are thought to create an inflammatory response and instigate focus to injured areas. A 2002 systematic review found that no additional benefit was incurred from the inclusion of deep tissue friction massage in a therapeutic regimen, although the conclusions were limited by the small sample sizes in available randomized clinical trials.
* Soft Tissue Technique is firm, direct pressure to relax hypertonic muscles and stretch tight fascial structures. A 2015 review concluded that the technique is ineffective for lower back pain, and the quality of research testing its effectiveness is poor.
* Trigger point techniques claim to address myofascial trigger points, though the explanation of how this works is controversial.

=== Stretching ===
From the main article&#x27;s effectiveness section:
* Apart from before running, stretching does not appear to reduce risk of injury during exercise.
* Some evidence shows that pre-exercise stretching may increase range of movement.
* The Mayo Clinic advises against bouncing, and to hold for thirty seconds. They suggest warming up before stretching or stretching post-exercise.

=== Taping ===
Manual therapy practitioners often use therapeutic taping to relieve pressure on injured soft tissue, alter muscle firing patterns or prevent re-injury. Some techniques are designed to enhance lymphatic fluid exchange. After a soft tissue injury to muscles or tendons from sports activities, over exertion or repetitive strain injury swelling may impede blood flow to the area and slow healing. Elastic taping methods may relieve pressure from swollen tissue and enhance circulation to the injured area.

According to the medical and skeptical community there is no known benefit from this technique and it is a pseudoscience.

== Styles of manual therapy ==

There are many different styles of manual therapy. It is a fundamental feature of ayurvedic medicine, traditional Chinese medicine and some forms of alternative medicine as well as being used by mainstream medical practitioners. Hands-on bodywork is a feature of therapeutic interactions in traditional cultures around the world.

==Efficacy==
In 2018, the Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy stated that due to the wide range of issues with various parts of the body and different techniques used, as well as a lack of modeling behavior, it can be difficult to tell just how effective manual therapy can be for a patient.

More recent research published in 2024 explained that historically, traditional manual therapy had no basis deeming it an effective modality for treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and pain. This faulty modality was centered around the clinician’s palpation, patho-anatomical reasoning, and technique specificity. The previously known manual therapy is shifting into a highly effective modern day physical therapy, which is not dependent on perfect palpation, and rather utilizes a patient-centered care model. Based on clinical trials and current data, modern day manual therapy is deemed effective when used in conjunction with other modalities for patients suffering with musculoskeletal diseases. The modern practice of manual therapy is centered around values such as safety, comfort, efficiency, communication, and patient-centeredness. Through this new approach, clinicians are encouraging their patient’s to assess their outcomes and progress and reevaluate their pain, thereby aligning the practice of manual therapy with the holistic approach to healthcare.

Results for migraines, headaches, and asthma are mixed due to a lack of clinical trials, though at least one article states that manual therapy is effective for asthma.

Manual therapy was shown to be effective for treating back pain, with trigger point therapy being used for myofascial pain, and manual manipulation for lower back pain.

The therapeutic pressure relieves pain and increases range of motion. While patient’s may complain of muscle soreness post treatment, this effect is expected and it is not deemed adverse.

<doc id="1255065" wikidata="Q2447271" url="?curid=1255065" title="Mongul">
<text>Mongul () is a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Writer Len Wein and artist Jim Starlin created the first version of the character, who debuted in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #27 (November 1980). Jerry Ordway created the second version, who first appeared in &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; #454 as the lord of Warworld. He was later embellished by Peter Tomasi and Scot Eaton in &quot;Showcase &#x27;95&quot;, #8. He is based on the Mongol Empire&#x27;s founder Genghis Khan and his successors, hence his name. The character was given an origin story in Green Lantern #23.2 by his co-creator Jim Starlin and artist Howard Porter as homage to the writers who participated in developing the character. He has become one of Superman&#x27;s most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.

Debuting in the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Mongul has been featured in other DC Comics-endorsed products such as animated series, video games, a direct-to-DVD film, and merchandise such as action figures and trading cards.

== Publication history ==
Mongul debuted in the title &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; and was created by writer Len Wein and artist Jim Starlin. Starlin often receives credit as creator of the character, but Wein in an interview stated: &quot;Well, [Mongul] had Starlin visuals, but he was my creation&quot;. Wein said he conceived Mongul specifically as a villain to physically challenge Superman. Starlin commented on the character as well stating, &quot;When I went over to DC... I went over and created Mongul and he was definitely supposed to be Thanos in the DC universe&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===Bronze Age (1980–1985)===
Mongul is the ruler of his species until he is overthrown and forced to flee his planet. In his first appearance, Mongul kidnaps Superman&#x27;s friends Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Steve Lombard and threatens to kill them unless the hero brings him a key to activate Warworld. Mongul is rendered unconscious by the mental strain from using Warworld, but escapes before the heroes destroy it.

Mongul then tries to conquer Throneworld, the home planet of Prince Gavyn / Starman. He murders Gavyn&#x27;s sister and obtains a Sun-Eater that he attempts to use to destroy Earth&#x27;s sun before the Justice League of America and Legion of Super-Heroes stop him.

In &quot;For the Man Who Has Everything&quot;, Mongul attacks Superman on his birthday and imprisons him in a dream world using the Black Mercy plant. Batman, Robin, and Wonder Woman defeat Mongul and use the Black Mercy on him.

===Modern Age (1985–present)===
Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity reboot, Mongul is reintroduced as the ruler of the Warworld empire. Mongul captures Superman, who works with Mongul&#x27;s champion Draaga to defeat him. Mongul later destroys Hal Jordan&#x27;s hometown of Coast City, leading to his transformation into Parallax. In &quot;Underworld Unleashed&quot;, Neron kills Mongul after he refuses his offer of power.

==== Son of Mongul ====
Following Mongul&#x27;s death, his son Mongul II succeeds him as ruler of Warworld and battles Superman to prepare him for the threat of Imperiex. In the prelude to &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Mongul obtains a Sinestro Corps ring and seizes control of the Corps before Sinestro imprisons him in the Yellow Lantern power battery.

====&quot;The New 52&quot;====
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, the original Mongul is resurrected and attacks the Sinestro Corps. After being deposed by Sinestro, Mongul allies with the Pale Vicors, a group who loot planets and nullify their inhabitants&#x27; ability to feel emotions.

In the &quot;Superman: Villains&quot; one-shot (May 2020), Mongul is killed and succeeded by his son, Mongul MDCCXCII.

==Powers and abilities==
Mongul possesses immense superhuman physical abilities comparable to Superman. Furthermore, he can teleport, generate energy blasts, possesses limited telepathy and telekinesis, and wields a chest-mounted cannon. For a time, he was also part of the Sinestro Corps, having access to all that it entailed; i.e., the ability to create fear-based energy constructs and gain power from the fear of others. As a Pale Vicor, Mongul can negate the powers of the emotional spectrum and generate a protective aura.

<text>One Yellow Rabbit Performance Theatre (OYR) is based in the Big Secret Theatre in Calgary’s Arts Commons. With its Resident Performing Ensemble, OYR creates original theatrical works each year for its home audiences and also hosts The High Performance Rodeo, Calgary’s International Festival of the Arts.

OYR was founded as a collective in 1982 and coalesced into the OYR Performing Ensemble circa 1987-8. In its history, the company has created almost 80 full-length original productions. Ensemble personnel have remained relatively consistent since then, and OYR established a professional administrative staff. 

The company’s philosophy and practice have been influenced by contemporary dance, the Artist-run centre movement, the Punk subculture, and the &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; creed.

In 1987, OYR produced the &quot;Secret Elevator Experimental Performance Festival&quot;, later renamed the &quot;High Performance Rodeo&quot; in 1988. The festival has grown annually in audience, venues, and impact, surpassing 10,000 attendees in 2006 and 16,000 in 2009. It now reaches over 20,000 audience members every year. The Rodeo features theatre, dance, music and multimedia presentations from across Canada and abroad. Artists presented in recent years range from hundreds of emerging artists to Philip Glass, Catalyst Theatre, Electric Company Theatre, Compagnie Marie Chouinard, Laurie Anderson, Andy Jones, members of The Kids In the Hall, Les Deux Mondes, Peggy Baker, Daniel MacIvor, and the OYR Ensemble itself. 

His Excellency Jean-Daniel Lafond was the Rodeo’s Honorary Patron from 2008-2009. He and Governor General Michaëlle Jean attended performances and hosted three “Art Matters” community forums as part of the festival.

OYR has toured across North America, Australia, Asia, Mexico and Europe. The 1990s saw a large increase in the number and frequency of tours, starting with the productions &quot;The Erotic Irony of Old Glory&quot; and &quot;Ilsa, Queen of the Nazi Love Camp&quot;. Scotland&#x27;s Traverse Theatre was often the launching pad for international tours.

In 1995, OYR expanded the Secret Theatre into the Big Secret Theatre, increasing its technical versatility and doubling its seating to 130. Seating was further upgraded in 2002 to a potential 249 (although most theatre shows play in the 189-seat configuration.)

In 1998, OYR&#x27;s Denise Clarke founded the Summer Lab Intensive School of performance creation, which was attended by 20 students from across Canada. The 2009 Lab was the 13th annual edition. 250 “rabbits” have graduated.

In 2003, Banff Centre Press published Wild Theatre: The History of One Yellow Rabbit by Martin Morrow. The book contains prefaces by Ronnie Burkett and Factory Theatre&#x27;s Ken Gass.

<text>Hewson Consultants were one of the smaller software companies which produced video games for home computers in the mid-1980s. They had a reputation for high-quality games which continually pushed the boundaries of what the computers were capable of and can be compared favourably with other ground-breaking software houses like Ultimate Play the Game and Beyond. Fourteen of their games were awarded &quot;Megagame&quot; by &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;.

Hewson was founded by Andrew Hewson in the early 1980s. He became interested in computers while working at the British Museum when their first machine arrived. After learning to program, Andrew wrote the programming guide book &quot;Hints and Tips for the ZX80&quot;. Following the publication, bedroom coders began to send Andrew the games they had programmed on cassette tape, giving Andrew the idea to publish the games. Hewson Consultants was born, and initially released games via mail order advertisements in computing magazines. Andrew was also a columnist in &quot;Sinclair User&quot; magazine throughout the 1980s.

==Legacy==
Andrew and other members of the Hewson management team went on to form 21st Century Entertainment after Hewson shut down in the early 1990s, releasing several games such as &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot;, &quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; and &quot;Pinball Illusions&quot;. Andrew was also the founder of ELSPA (European Leisure Software Publishers Association) which continues to be the European regulating body for the video games industry.

<doc id="1255078" wikidata="Q3815580" url="?curid=1255078" title="Abjection">
<text>In critical theory, abjection is the state of being cast off and separated from norms and rules, especially on the scale of society and morality. The term has been explored in post-structuralism as that which inherently disturbs conventional identity and cultural concepts. Julia Kristeva explored an influential and formative overview of the concept in her 1980 work &quot;Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection&quot;, where she describes subjective horror (abjection) as the feeling when an individual experiences or is confronted by the sheer experience of what Kristeva calls one&#x27;s typically repressed &quot;corporeal reality&quot;, or an intrusion of the Real in the Symbolic Order.

Kristeva&#x27;s concept of abjection is used commonly to analyze popular cultural narratives of horror, and discriminatory behavior manifesting in misogyny, homophobia and genocide. The concept of abjection builds on the traditional psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan, whose studies often narrowed in on the experience of the disintegration of personal distinctions, through neurosis in Freud and psychosis in Lacan.

==In literary critical theory==
Drawing on the French tradition of interest in the monstrous (e.g., novelist Louis-Ferdinand Céline), and of the subject as grounded in &quot;filth&quot; (e.g., psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan), Julia Kristeva developed the idea of the abject as that which is rejected by or disturbs social reasonthe communal consensus that underpins a social order. The &quot;abject&quot; exists accordingly somewhere between the concept of an object and the concept of the subject, representing taboo elements of the self barely separated off in a liminal space. Kristeva claims that within the boundaries of what one defines as subjecta part of oneselfand objectsomething that exists independently of oneselfthere reside pieces that were once categorized as a part of oneself or one&#x27;s identity that has since been rejectedthe abject.

However, Kristeva created a distinction in the true meaning of abjection: &quot;It is thus not the lack of cleanliness or health that causes abjection but what disturbs identity, system, and order. What does not respect borders, positions, rules. The in-between, the ambiguous, the composite.&quot; Since the abject is situated outside the symbolic order, being forced to face it is an inherently traumatic experience, as with the repulsion presented by confrontation with filth, waste, or a corpsean object which is violently cast out of the cultural world, having once been a subject. Thus the sense of the abject complements the existence of the superegothe representative of culture, of the symbolic order: in Kristeva&#x27;s aphorism, &quot;To each ego its object, to each superego its abject.&quot;

From Kristeva&#x27;s psychoanalytic perspective, abjection is done to the part of ourselves that we exclude: the mother. We must abject the maternal, the object which has created us, in order to construct an identity. Abjection occurs on the micro level of the speaking being, through their subjective dynamics, as well as on the macro level of society, through &quot;language as a common and universal law&quot;. We use rituals, specifically those of defilement, to attempt to maintain clear boundaries between nature and society, the semiotic and the symbolic, paradoxically both excluding and renewing contact with the abject in the ritual act.

The concept of abjection is often coupled (and sometimes confused) with the idea of the uncanny, the concept of something being &quot;un-home-like&quot;, or foreign, yet familiar. The abject can be uncanny in the sense that we can recognize aspects in it, despite its being &quot;foreign&quot;: a corpse, having fallen out of the symbolic order, creates abjection through its uncanninesscreates a cognitive dissonance.

===Cases===
* Abjection is a major theme of the 1949 work &quot;The Thief&#x27;s Journal&quot; (Journal du Voleur) by French author Jean Genet, a fictionalised account of his wanderings through Europe in the 1930s, wherein he claims as a criminal outcast to actively seek abjections as an existentialist form of &quot;sainthood&quot;
* The film &quot;Alien&quot; (1979) has been analysed as an example of how in horror and science fiction monstrous representations of the female resonate with the abject archaic figure of the mother. Bodily dismemberment, forcible impregnation, and the chameleon nature of the alien itself may all be seen as explorations of phantasies of the primal scene, and of the encounter with the boundaryless nature of the original abject mother.
*The 1990s-era Australian literary genre grunge lit often focuses on young adult characters with &quot;abject&quot; bodies that are deteriorating and characters facing health problems. For example, the male and female lead characters in Andrew McGahan&#x27;s book &quot;Praise&quot;, Gordon Buchanan and Cynthia Lamonde, both have diseased bodies, with Cynthia facing skin that breaks out in rashes. Karen Brooks states that Clare Mendes&#x27; &quot;Drift Street&quot;, Edward Berridge&#x27;s &quot;The Lives of the Saints&quot;, and &quot;Praise&quot; &quot;...explor[e] the psychosocial and psychosexual limitations of young sub/urban characters in relation to the imaginary and socially constructed boundaries defining...self and other&quot; and &quot;opening up&quot; new &quot;limnal [boundary] spaces&quot; where the concept of an abject human body can be explored. Brooks states that the marginalized characters (in &quot;The Lives of the Saints&quot;, &quot;Drift Street&quot; and &quot;Praise&quot;) are able to stay in &quot;shit creek&quot; (an undesirable setting or situation) and &quot;diver[t]... flows&quot; of these &quot;creeks&quot;, thus claiming their rough settings&#x27; &quot;limnality&quot; (being in a border situation or transitional setting) and their own &quot;abjection&quot; (having &quot;abject bodies&quot; with health problems, disease, etc.) as &quot;sites of symbolic empowerment and agency&quot;.

==In social critical theory==
&quot;Abjection&quot; is often used to describe the state of often-marginalized groups, such as women, unwed mothers, people of minority religious faiths, sex workers, convicts, and poor and disabled people. From a deconstruction of sexual discourses and gender history Ian McCormick has outlined the recurring links between pleasurable transgressive desire, deviant categories of behaviour and responses to body fluids in 18th and 19th-century discussions of prostitution, sodomy, and masturbation (self-pollution, impurity, uncleanness). The term space of abjection is also used, referring to a space that abjected things or beings inhabit.

===In organizational studies===
Organizational theory literature on abjection has attempted to illuminate various ways in which institutions come to silence, exclude or disavow feelings, practices, groups or discourses within the workplace. Studies have examined and demonstrated the manner in which people adopt roles, identities and discourses to avoid the consequences of social and organizational abjection. In such studies the focus is often placed upon a group of people within an organization or institution that fall outside of the norm, thus becoming what Kristeva terms &quot;the one by whom the abject exists,&quot; or &quot;the deject&quot; people. Institutions and organizations typically rely on rituals and other structural practices to protect symbolic elements from the semiotic, both in a grander organizational focus that emphasizes the role of policy-making, and in a smaller interpersonal level that emphasizes social rejection. Both the organizational and interpersonal levels produce a series of exclusionary practices that create a &quot;zone of inhabitability&quot; for staff perceived to be in opposition to the organizational norms.

One such method is that of &quot;collective instruction,&quot; which refers to a strategy often used to defer, render abject and hide the inconvenient &quot;dark side&quot; of the organization, keeping it away from view through corporate forces. This is the process by which an acceptable, unified meaning is createdfor example, a corporation&#x27;s or organization&#x27;s mission statement. Through the controlled release of information and belief or reactionary statements, people are gradually exposed to a firm&#x27;s persuasive interpretation of an event or circumstance, that could have been considered abject. This spun meaning developed by the firm becomes shared throughout a community. That event or circumstance comes to be interpreted and viewed in a singular way by many people, creating a unified, accepted meaning. The purpose such strategies serve is to identify and attempt to control the abject, as the abject ideas become ejected from each individual memory.

Organizations such as hospitals must negotiate the divide between the symbolic and the semiotic in a unique manner. Nurses, for example, are confronted with the abject in a more concrete, physical fashion due to their proximity to the ill, wounded and dying. They are faced with the reality of death and suffering in a way not typically experienced by hospital administrators and leaders. Nurses must learn to separate themselves and their emotional states from the circumstances of death, dying and suffering they are surrounded by. Very strict rituals and power structures are used in hospitals, which suggests that the dynamics of abjection have a role to play in understanding not only how anxiety becomes the work of the health team and the organization, but also how it is enacted at the level of hospital policy.

===In sociological studies===
The abject is a concept that is often used to describe bodies and things that one finds repulsive or disgusting, and in order to preserve one&#x27;s identity they are cast out. Imogen Tyler sought to make the concept more social in order to analyze abjection as a social and lived process and to consider both those who abject and those who find themselves abjected, between representation of the powerful and the resistance of the oppressed. Tyler conducted an examination into the way that contemporary Britain had labelled particular groups of peoplemostly minority groupsas revolting figures, and how those individuals revolt against their abject identity, also known as marginalization, stigmatizing and/or social exclusion.

Exploration has also been done into the way people look at others whose bodies may look different from the norm due to illness, injury or birth defect. Researchers such as Frances emphasize the importance of the interpersonal consequences that result from this looking. A person with a disability, by being similar to abled people and also different, is the person by whom the abject exists. People who view this individual react to that abjection by either attempting to ignore and reject it, or by attempting to engage and immerse themselves in it. In this particular instance, Frances claims, the former manifests through the refusal to make eye contact or acknowledge the presence of the personal with a disability, while the latter manifests through intrusive staring. The interpersonal consequences that result from this are either that the person with a disability is denied and treated as an &#x27;other&#x27;an object that can be ignoredor that the individual is clearly identified and defined as a deject.

==In psychotherapy==
By bringing focus onto concepts such as abjection, psychotherapists may allow for the exploration of links between lived experience and cultural formations in the development of particular psychopathologies. Bruan Seu demonstrated the critical importance of bringing together Foucauldian ideas of self-surveillance and positioning in discourse with a psychodynamic theorization in order to grasp the full significance of psychological impactors, such as shame.

Concerning psychopathologies such as body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), the role of the otheractual, imagined or fantasizedis central, and ambivalence about the body, inflated by shame, is the key to this dynamic. Parker noted that individuals suffering from BDD are sensitive to the power, pleasure and pain of being looked at, as their objective sense of self dominates any subjective sense. The role of the other has become increasingly significant to developmental theories in contemporary psychoanalysis, and is very evident in body image as it is formed through identification, projection and introjection. Those individuals with BDD consider a part of their body unattractive or unwanted, and this belief is exacerbated by shame and the impression that others notice and negatively perceive the supposed physical flaw, which creates a cycle. Over time, the person with BDD begins to view that part of their body as being separate from themselves, a rogue body partit has been abjected.

There are also those who experience social anxiety, who experience the subjectification of being abject in a similar yet different way to those with BDD. Abject, here, refers to marginally objectionable material that does not quite belong in the greater society as a wholewhether this not-belonging is real or imagined is irrelevant, only that it is perceived. For those with social anxiety, it is their entire social self which is perceived to be the deject, straying away from normal social rituals and capabilities.

Studying abjection has proven to be suggestive and helpful for considering the dynamics of self and body hatred. This carries interesting implications for studying such disorders as separation anxiety, biologically centered phobias, and post traumatic stress disorder.

==In art==
The roots of abject art go back a long way. The Tate defines abject art as that which &quot;explore themes that transgress and threaten our sense of cleanliness and propriety, particularly referencing the body and bodily functions.&quot; Painters expressed a fascination for blood long before the Renaissance but it was not until the Dada movement that the fascination with transgression and taboo made it possible for abject art, as a movement, to exist. It was influenced by Antonin Artaud&#x27;s &quot;Theatre of Cruelty&quot;. The Whitney Museum in New York City identified abject art in 1993.

It was preceded by the films and performances of the Viennese actionists, in particular, Hermann Nitsch, whose interest in Schwitter&#x27;s idea of a gesamtkunstwerk (total artwork) led to his setting up the radical theatre group, known as the Orgien-Mysterien-Theater. The group used animal carcasses and bloodshed in a ritualistic way. Nitsch served time in jail for blasphemy before being invited to New York in 1968 by Jonas Mekas. Nitsch organised a series of performances which influenced the radical New York art scene. Other members of the Viennese Actionists, Gunter Brus, who began as a painter, and Otto Muehl collaborated on performances. The performances of Gunter Brus involved publicly urinating, defecating and cutting himself with a razor blade. Rudolf Schwarzkogler is known for his photos dealing with the abject. 
In the late 1960s, performance art become popular in New York, including by Carolee Schneemann. Mary Kelly, Genesis P. Orridge and GG Allin did this type of art.

In the 1980s and 1990s, fascination with the &quot;Powers of Horror&quot;, the title of a book by Julia Kristeva, led to a second wave of radical performance artists working with bodily fluids including Ron Athey, Franko B, Lennie Lee and Kira O&#x27; Reilly. Kristeva herself associated aesthetic experience of the abject, such as art and literature, with poetic catharsisan impure process that allows the artist or author to protect themselves from the abject only by immersing themselves within it.

In the late 1990s, the abject became a theme of radical Chinese performance artists Zhu Yu and Yang Zhichao. The abject also began to influence mainstream artists including Louise Bourgeois, Helen Chadwick, Gilbert and George, Robert Gober, Kiki Smith and Jake and Dinos Chapman who were all included in the 1993 Whitney show. Other artists working with abjection include New York photographers, Joel Peter Witkin, whose book &quot;Love and Redemption&quot; and Andres Serrano whose piece entitled &quot;Piss Christ&quot; caused a scandal in 1989.

<text>Swami Akhandananda (1864–1937) was a swami and direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, a 19th-century mystic. He was the third president of the Ramakrishna Mission.

== Early life ==

=== Initial Years ===
Akhandananda was born as Gangadhar Ghatak (Gangopadhyay) on 30 September 1864, in Ahiritola area of western Kolkata, to Srimanta Gangopadhyay and Vamasundari Devi. He came from a respectable Brahmin family. He was orthodox in nature and was dubbed as &quot;oldish&quot; by Ramakrishna. From his very childhood, Gangadhar was so compassionate that he once gave his own shirt to a poor classmate whose shirt was torn. Without telling his parents, he would give food to beggars. He was a strong moralist and always helped his wayward friends. Gangadhar was a vivacious, handsome boy in childhood. Gifted with prodigious memory, Gangadhar mastered the English alphabet in one day.
Gangadhar first met Ramakrishna, the famous mystic and saint whom he later adopted as his Master, in 1884, when he was nineteen years old, in the temple of Dakshineswar. He visited Ramakrishna for the first time in the company of his friend Harinath (later Turiyananda). He had first seen Ramakrishna in the house of Dinanath Bose at a very young age. Ramakrishna did not want him to be over orthodox and therefore introduced him to Narendranath Dutta (later Vivekananda). Gangadhar was favourably impressed with Narendranath and became devoted to him, a devotion which lasted throughout his life and which later prompted him to take up service as the primary work over spiritual practices. During his visits to Dakshineswar, Gangadhar received instructions on meditation from Ramakrishna.

=== Pre monastic days ===
Gangadhar&#x27;s father found a job for Gangadhar in a merchant&#x27;s office. Gangadhar worked there a few days and then gave it up. He then fully engaged himself in spiritual disciplines and service to the master. 
Gangadhar served Ramakrishna during the illness of the latter. After the death of Ramakrishna, when the Baranagar Math was formed by Narendranath and other brother disciples, Gangadhar renounced his family life and embraced a life of travel with consent from his family and set foot for the Himalayas.
Steeped in Vedanta and his own experience, his mind ever pined to be absorbed in the bliss of the Himalayan solitude. In 1887, after visiting Kedarnath and Badrinath, he travelled to Tibet where he lived in Lhasa and elsewhere for three years, returning to India in 1890. 
Gangadhar&#x27;s entire travel account is recorded in his book &quot;Smriti-Katha (From Holy Wanderings to The Service of God in Man)&quot;. He travelled hundreds of miles in the mountains of the Himalayas without carrying any money or extra clothing.

=== Life as a Monk ===

==== Travels ====
Gangadhar took his monastic vow in 1890, in Baranagar Math and in the presence of SwamiVivekananda, and was given the name of &quot;Akhandananda&quot; (Akhanda - undifferentiated, ananda - bliss, one who finds supreme bliss in the undifferentiated nature of the Truth). After his return, he had frequent correspondence with Vivekananda, then at Ghazipur, who induced him to join him in travelling in some places of the Himalayas because of the latter&#x27;s experience and familiarity in those terrains. Accordingly, Akhandananda came to Baranagore monastery, and after spending a few happy months with his brother-disciples, sharing his experiences with them, he set out in July 1890, with Vivekananda on a pilgrimage to the Himalayas. Visiting important places on the way they reached Almora, but the illness of one or the other plagued their journey, and they returned via Tehri to Dehra Dun, from where Akhandananda proceeded to Meerut for treatment. Vivekananda also joined him in Meerut, and they met some other brother disciples. After five months of association, Vivekananda left them and Akhandananda followed him surreptitiously, going from one province to another in his search, but everywhere he narrowly missed meeting him. Finally, he met Vivekananda again in Kutch where Swami Vivekananda entreated him to follow a separate course. Accordingly, Akhandananda continued his pilgrimage separately.

==== Intellectual Pursuits ====
During his days of wandering in the Himalayas, he studied Avadhuta Gita at Srinagar in Garhwal. In 1891, while resting at Etawah, he spent most of his time reading the Mahabhashya, Patanjali&#x27;s voluminous commentary on Panini&#x27;s Sanskrit grammar, as well as Sridhara Swami’s commentary on the Bhagavadgita. In Jamnagar in 1892, he studied the Charaka-Sushruta Samhita with the help of the Sanskrit lexicon Shabdartha Chandrika Kosha and also Shukla Yajur Veda. In Udaipur, he read the Vedantic text of Panchadasi. He also learned Hindi grammar from Bhasha Bhaskara, to correct his Hindi pronunciation. In Indore, he completed a reading of the entire Valmiki Ramayana over a period of eighteen days. Later in Mahula he undertook a critical study of the Yogavasishtha Ramayana.

==== Relationship with Vivekananda and Sarada Devi ====
Akhandananda was an ardent follower of Vivekananda, who called him lovingly as &quot;Ganges&quot;. He was also devoted to Sarada Devi. When hard work in Murshidabad took a toll on his health, she had him brought to Calcutta for treatment and took special care of him.

==== Final Years ====
Akhandananda became the vice president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission in 1925 and the third president after the demise of Swami Shivananda in 1934. He initiated a number of people after assuming office. However, he continued to stay at Sargachhi.

Akhandananda also initiated Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, the second sarsanghachalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.

He participated in the celebration of the Birth Centenary of Ramakrishna in 1936 in Calcutta.

In February 1937 he fell ill and was brought to Calcutta. He died in Belur Math on 7 February 1937.

== Service ==
Akhandananda was the first monk of the Ramakrishna order, who gave shape to the cherished desire of Vivekananda to begin rural development work—even before the Mission was established. 
The distressing sorrows and suffering of the masses pulled him down to the plains, and to them, he became a harbinger of peace and succour. Sacrificing his Himalayan bliss, he chose to be with poor. Akhandananda practised till the very end of his life his Master&#x27;s call: Worship jiva as Shiva. He was one of the pillars of the Ramakrishna Movement&#x27;s service activities.
His experience as a wandering monk, like those of Vivekananda, moved him to take steps to remove the distress and misery of the masses. Vivekananda&#x27;s encouraging letter from America which was sent as a reply to Akhandananda&#x27;s request for guidance pushed him further, and in 1894 Akhandananda began his campaign against poverty.
The idea of working for the poor was conceived while he stayed in Jamnagar with Jhandu Bhatt, the famous ayurvedic physician, who served his patients with exceptional devotion.
While in Khetri, Rajasthan during 1894, he went about from door to door, all alone to bring awareness in the people about the utility of education, and it was because of his efforts that the number of students in the Khetri Rajya English School rose from 80 to 257.
Under his inspiration, the Maharaja of Khetri Ajit Singh arranged for the education of the Golas and also set up a permanent Education Department to open schools in the villages. Akhandananda also arranged for the publication of a newspaper on agriculture in order to educate the farmers of that area. He also contacted renowned landlords in the numerous village of Khetri, inspiring them to take some concrete steps towards removing the miseries of their poor labourers. At the instance of the Swami the Sanskrit school in Khetri was converted to Vedic school, and he raised subscriptions to purchase books for the poor students. He fed the Bhils, an aboriginal tribe, in Uadaipur. He left Rajputana in 1895 and returned to the Alambazar Math, the new monastery of the Ramakrishna disciples. He first came in contact with widespread famine during his travel in the Murshidabad district of Bengal. He sought help from his brother disciples in 1897 and Vivekananda, who had returned to India by then, sent two monks with money.
On 1 May 1897 Vivekananda inaugurated the Ramakrishna Mission, and Akhandananda opened a relief centre on 15 May in the temple premises of Mrityunjay Bhattacharya of Kedar-Mahula in Murshidabad to save people from an all-devouring famine. Though rice was difficult to procure at that time, he managed to procure some with the help of other people and with much trouble. Then he distributed equally among the poor, weighing the rice himself on a scale. This was the first public service work done by the Ramakrishna Mission.

Akhandananda started an orphanage in Mahula, near Berhampore, on 31 August 1897, and then established the first Rural Branch Centre of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission in Mahula. In 1899, he opened an ashrama in Shivnagar near Sargachi which continued for 14 years. In 1899, he opened a free school there to deal with the problem of illiteracy in the locality. A carpentry and a weaving section also were added to revive those perishing village industries and make the boys self-reliant. Cotton cultivation was taught to the rural women to enhance their family income. In 1913 the present ashrama was found on a 13 acres land in March 1913.
He also led in relief activities in the Bhagalpur district of Bihar and during the Munger earthquake in Bihar.

<doc id="1255092" wikidata="Q7262452" url="?curid=1255092" title="Puttanna Kanagal">
<text>Shubraveshti Ramaswamiah Seetharama Sharma (1 December 1933 – 5 June 1985), known popularly as S. R. Puttanna Kanagal, was an Indian filmmaker known for his work in Kannada cinema. He is often considered one of Indian cinema&#x27;s most influential filmmakers.

==Background and personal life==
Puttanna Kanagal was born to Ramaswamaiah and Subbamma in Kanagal, a village in the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore into a poor family. As he hailed from a poor brahmin family, he had to endure hardships and struggled to get a decent job. He worked as a teacher, salesman and even as a cleaner. His job as a publicity boy brought him closer to theatre and subsequently to cinema. His association with films began when he started working for B. R. Panthulu as an assistant director and also as his driver. His first film as an assistant director was &quot;Rathnagiri Rahasya&quot; (1957).

Puttanna married Nagalakshmi at very young age and they had 5 children. However he fell in love with his protege and leading actress in 1970s Aarathi and they got married during 1976–77. They had a daughter Yashaswini, who was born in 1978. However, due to creative differences Puttanna and Aarathi separated in 1981.

In 1981, Puttanna&#x27;s magnum opus Ranganayaki did not do as well as expected at the box office, even though it gained critical acclaim and later went on to become a cult classic. In addition to this, separation from Aarathi had impacted his health. He had no work in hand for 14 months starting from late 1980 to mid of 1982. Srinath whom Puttanna directed in blockbuster films like Shubhamangala and Dharmasere came to his help, and they made Maanasa Sarovara which became an average hit and helped Puttanna bounce back. Kanagal died on 5 June 1985 in Bengaluru while shooting Masanada Hoovu.

Starting his career as a publicity boy, Kanagal was drawn into independent filmmaking after a stint in theatre and working with film director and producer B. R. Panthulu as his assistant. Kanagal&#x27;s assistants include Tamil directors S. P. Muthuraman, Bharathiraja, and T. S. Nagabharana.

Although a majority of Kanagal&#x27;s films were on offbeat or taboo subjects, generally women-centric, he endeared himself to both the critics and ordinary film goers alike making &quot;bridge films&quot; between art and commercial cinema. His film in Kannada, &quot;Gejje Pooje&quot;, based on a novel of the same name by M. K. Indira is considered a landmark film. He would go on to direct other films such as &quot;Kappu Bilupu&quot; (1969), &quot;Sharapanjara&quot; (1971), &quot;Naagarahaavu&quot; (1972), &quot;Edakallu Guddada Mele&quot; (1973), &quot;Shubhamangala&quot; (1975) and &quot;Ranganayaki&quot; (1981), all of which are seen as milestones in Kannada cinema. He also directed a handful of films in Malayalam, Tamil Telugu and Hindi languages.

=== As a director ===
Often credited as a movie-maker much ahead of his times, his first directorial venture was the 1964 Malayalam movie &quot;School Master&quot;, a remake of his mentor B. R. Panthulu&#x27;s Kannada classic of the same name He then directed another Malayalam movie &quot;Poochakkanni&quot; (Cat eyed/Hazel eyed lady) based on the Kannada novel &quot;Bekkina Kannu&quot; by Triveni. Puttanna&#x27;s first Kannada film as a director was &quot;Bellimoda&quot; (Silver Cloud) in 1967. Starring Kalpana and Kalyan Kumar, this movie was a critical and commercial success. Legend has it that Puttanna scouted for a week to find the perfect location for the mellifluous song &quot;Moodala Maneyaa&quot;. Belli Moda is credited as the first Kannada movie to be shot exclusively outdoors. He directed many masterpieces like &quot;Gejje Pooje&quot;, &quot;Sharapanjara&quot;, &quot;Naagarahaavu&quot; etc &#x27;. His last film was &quot;Savira Mettilu&quot;, which never released during his lifetime.

He also provided a platform for many actors such as Kalpana, Aarathi, Leelavathi, Jayanthi, Padma Vasanthi, Srinath, Rajinikanth, Vishnuvardhan, Ambareesh, Jai Jagadish, Chandra Shekhar, Gangadhar, Shivaram, Vajramuni, Sridhar, Ramakrishna and Aparna to showcase their talents.

In devotion to Puttanna, Vishnuvardhan said, &quot;Puttanna Kanagal Sir was the God-sent teacher for me! And I have been made an actor. I am indebted to guru Puttanaji. He used to conceptualize scenes, narrate them to me, inspire me and extract the potential till then unknown to myself. Acting in a single movie under Puttanna&#x27;s expertise is an experience of a lifetime.&quot;

Puttanna introduced most of the actors in the Kannada film industry. Tamil director Bharathiraja worked under him. Each of Kanagal&#x27;s 24 Kannada movies had strong themes filled with unprecedented direction.

Tamil legendary film maker K. Balachander, winner of the 2010 Dadasaheb Phalke Award had great regard for Puttanna. In many of his interviews to the media, Balachandar has stated that he considered a much younger, Puttanna Kanagal, a director from Kannada(Karnataka) film industry to be his guru in film making. An excerpt from one such interview:

:Q) You have stated in many interviews that you consider Puttanna Kanagal (Kannada filmmaker), though younger than you, as your guru in filmmaking. What is it that you learnt from him?

:A) Age has got nothing to do with learning. You can learn from anybody and everybody. I liked and admired Puttanna Kanagal, because, at the time when many of our filmmakers lacked the vision of filmmaking in terms of visuals he was the one who insisted on films being visual than oral. Apart from that his ability to churn out the human emotions from his actors was one of his kind.

In fact Balachander, for most of the remakes of his Tamil films in Kannada (Benkiyalli Aralida Hoo, Mauna Geethe) has gone on to cast many of the talents like Ashwath, Sridhar, Jai Jagadesh, Ramakrishna, Srinath, nurtured in Puttanna&#x27;s camp. Also, both Puttanna&#x27;s and Balachander&#x27;s films dealt with the issues on women – more so in Puttanna&#x27;s films.

=== The Visualiser ===
The Kannada film industry in the 1960s and the 1970s started moving from mythological and historical subjects to socially relevant themes. This metamorphosis was reflected in the rise of &quot;bandaaya sahitya&quot; or rebellious literature. The New Wave Cinema or Alternate Cinema movement spread across India, particularly in Karnataka, West Bengal and Kerala. Puttanna&#x27;s movies, however, were seen as a bridge between commercial cinema and alternate cinema. While his plots, based on popular Kannada novels, revolved around strong characters and distinct themes, he added mandatory songs and emotions to distinguish from alternate cinemas. His mastery over symbolism is quite remarkable. He has effectively used effectively in almost all of his movies.

Puttanna was also considered as a pioneer in picturising songs. In general, his movies contained 4–5 songs. Even with respect to song picturisation, Puttanna had a strong sense of colour and imagery. He would go to great lengths to select the locations and costumes for a song. The songs generally reflected the inherent mood of the film. For instance, the song from the movie &quot;Manasasarovara&quot;, &quot;Neene saakida gini&quot;, a poignant song, was shot amidst the dust-filled mining areas, thereby reflecting the agony of a man who has lost his true love. Similarly the song &quot;sandesha megha sandesha&quot; from the movie &quot;Sharapanjara&quot; was shot in the Madikeri, with innumerable oranges strewn around.

He was well known for his effective use of freeze shots and negative images to heighten the introspective effect of key scenes. Although his films were accused of being too woman-centric, Puttanna personally felt that such notions were wrong.

He was the first director of the Kannada Film Directors Association after its inception in 1984. Poonam Theatre in Jayanagar, Bangalore was renamed in his honor after his last film debuted there. In 2004, the theatre closed until reopening after a 2011 campaign supported by Baraguru Ramachandrappa, V. Manohar and the Democratic Youth Federation of India and was scheduled for demolition in July 2012 but later saved and remodeled. In June 2015, the 30th anniversary of his death was honored with an event organized by the Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy and guests and speakers included Ambareesh, Leelavathi, S. Shivaram, Jai Jagadish, Ashok, K. S. L. Swamy and Rajendra Singh Babu.

==Awards and honours==
Kanagal received three National Film Awards, three Filmfare Awards South and multiple Karnataka State Film Awards. Karnataka state honours film directors and various personalities with Puttanna Kanagal Award in his memory every year during the Karnataka State Awards function.

<doc id="1255094" wikidata="Q530013" url="?curid=1255094" title="Nissan Tiida">
<text>The is a compact car produced by the Japanese manufacturer Nissan from 2004 to 2023 through three generations. Depending on the market, the Tiida was also marketed as a subcompact car, particularly in the Americas for the first-generation model as the Nissan Versa. The first-generation model (C11) was produced up to 2018 in some markets, and was offered as a four-door sedan and a five-door hatchback.

The second-generation of Tiida (C12) is marketed since 2011 and only available as a five-door hatchback, while the role of a four-door sedan was passed to the subcompact Almera/Latio/Sunny/Versa (N17) and the compact Sylphy/Sentra/Pulsar (B17). Starting in 2013, the C12 Tiida was released in Thailand, Australia and New Zealand as the Nissan Pulsar. The C12 Tiida represents a departure from the C11, increasing its width to comfortably occupy the compact class, and was no longer marketed in Japan. It is currently produced and marketed in Taiwan.

The third-generation Tiida sold in Russia and China was introduced in 2015 as a rebadged Pulsar (C13) hatchback.


==Etymology==
The name &quot;Tiida&quot; is Okinawan for &quot;sun&quot;, continuing the naming tradition started in 1966 with the Nissan Sunny.

== First generation (C11; 2004) ==
Nissan revealed the C-Note concept car in 2003 to preview the styling of the C11 Tiida. It is a concept hatchback based on the same platform of the Renault Mégane. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show.

The Tiida hatchback and the Tiida Latio sedan debuted in Japan in 2004, and in some European countries in 2007. It is based on a stretched-wheelbase variant of the Nissan B platform, and was manufactured as a five-door hatchback and a four-door sedan. It was sold in North America as Nissan Versa, and in Southeast Asia as the Nissan Latio. The C11 sat between the subcompact and compact car classes, acting as an intermediate model between the smaller Micra/March and larger Sylphy and Sentra models within the global Nissan portfolio.

Nissan initially directed every markets to adopt the Tiida nameplate for the vehicle, despite objections from several markets such as Australia, which insisted using the more well-known Pulsar nameplate. The US market ended up choosing a new nameplate, the Versa, which established a precedent for Australia to reuse Pulsar nameplate to the succeeding C12 generation.

In Japan, the Tiida replaced the Nissan Sunny (B15) in Nissan&#x27;s lineup as the smallest sedan. In North America, it became a new entry-level model below the Sentra; and elsewhere the Tiida tended to occupy the role performed previously by the Nissan Almera/Pulsar/Sentra/Sunny (N16), sold in Japan as the Bluebird Sylphy (G10). The G10/N16&#x27;s successor, the Bluebird Sylphy G11 was not widely sold outside Japan.

Engines include a 1.5-liter or 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, the larger of which can be coupled to a six-speed manual transmission. There are also two optional dealer packages: the Nismo S-tune Aero Package and Nismo Performance Package.

=== Facelift ===
In January 2008, Nissan introduced facelifted versions of both the hatchback and the sedan. They were enhanced with some key changes including new exterior features and interior designs, retuned power steering, powertrain enhancements and a new Plus navi HDD package called CarWings in Japan.

The exterior features a new grille, front bumper, headlights, tail lights, rear bumper and new wheel covers. The interior sports a more modern look as well as better visibility and usability, new instrument cluster design and metallic-finish dash panels.

The C11 started to be phased out in China first, during 2011 when partially replaced by the larger, compact class C12 Tiida/Pulsar hatchback. In 2012, the C11 began to be withdrawn from more markets as its main production bases ceased manufacture. The C11 was also replaced by the subcompact Nissan Note or Versa Note (E12) hatchback, and on the sedan fronts, by the subcompact Almera/Latio/Sunny/Versa (N17) and the compact Nissan Pulsar/Sentra/Sylphy (B17).

=== Safety ===
The Tiida Hatch in its most basic Latin American version with one airbag received 3 stars for adult occupants and 1 star for toddlers from Latin NCAP in May 2011.

The Tiida Hatch with two airbags received 4 stars for adult occupants and 1 star for toddlers from Latin NCAP in November 2011.

The Tiida Sedan in its most basic Latin American version with no airbags and no ABS received 0 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in April 2015.

The Tiida Sedan with two airbags and no ABS received 4 stars for adult occupants and 2 stars for toddlers from Latin NCAP in September 2015.

=== Marketing ===
;Asia
In mainland China, the Tiida is produced by the Dongfeng Motor Company, a joint venture between Nissan and a local company.

In Malaysia, the first generation Tiida was sold as the Latio and was available in both sedan and hatchback body styles. The sedan was simply known as Latio while the hatchback was known as the Latio Sport. Unveiled in May 2007 and available in June 2007, four variants were initially offered for the sedan body style: 1.6 ST (M), 1.6 ST (A), 1.6 ST-L (A), 1.8 Ti (A). The hatchback was available in a sole 1.6 ST-L (A) variant. In April 2008, a limited &#x27;Tuned By Impul&#x27; edition was available for both variants. The &#x27;Tuned By Impul&#x27; edition featured a body kit, sports suspension, different exhaust system and different alloy wheels. In September 2011, the facelift version of Latio reduced the variant count to just two. A sole 1.6 variant for the sedan and a sole 1.8 variant for the hatchback.

In Singapore, the Tiida and Tiida Latio were initially sold alongside the older and cheaper Sunny N16 and the bigger and more expensive Sylphy.

In Indonesia, the Tiida 1.8 hatchback was marketed for private use, while the 1.6 sedan was for taxi fleet only.

In Hong Kong, the Tiida was used as a police car by the Hong Kong police. Some were police patrol cars whereas some were airport police cars.

In Taiwan, both Tiida hatchback and Tiida sedan are produced by Yulon. The Tiida sedan was still in production until May 2018.

;North America

The Versa was introduced in the United States and Canada in July 2006 as a 2007 model. North and Latin American models of the Tiida use a DOHC 1.8-liter gasoline engine and are assembled at Nissan&#x27;s Aguascalientes, Mexico assembly plant. It is also the only Nissan four-door passenger car in the United States and Canada to be sold worldwide, since the Sentra, Altima and Maxima are exclusive to North America.

According to a Nissan press release in 2008, &quot;versa&quot; is short for &quot;versatile space&quot; meant to imply the spaciousness of the interior and configurable cargo arrangements.

The North American Versa debuted at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in January of the same year. The hatchback model was introduced first, with the sedan arriving later at the end of the year, both as 2007 models. A 1.6-liter sedan replaced the 1.8-liter sedan in Canada for the 2009 model year, that year in the United States the 1.6 sedan was added to the lineup along the 1.8 sedan.

The Versa is powered by a 1.8 L I4 MR series engine producing 122 hp (91 kW) and 127 ft·lbf (170 N·m). Three transmissions are offered: a four-speed automatic, a continuously variable transmission (CVT), and a six-speed manual. Two trim levels include the S and SL—the SL offering air conditioning, power accessories and ABS, all of which are options on the S. The Versa SL also has features/options not available on the S such as cruise control (available on some S models), alloy wheels, optional CVT (the four-speed automatic is only available for the Versa S but CVT is available on some S models), optional Bluetooth connectivity for electronic devices, and a sport package which adds a power moonroof, rear spoiler, and underside aero kit.

Introduced for the 2009 model year in sedan form only, is the Versa 1.6-liter which uses the &quot;HR16DE&quot; inline-four gasoline engine, rated at and of torque. The base transmission is a five-speed manual; a four-speed automatic is optional.

The Versa 1.6 features black trim (instead of body-colored) for the exterior mirror housings, license plate trim, and front grille; 14-inch steel wheels; black interior; four radio speakers with pre-wiring for a radio—but no radio itself. Safety features include six airbags, active front head restraints, and a tire pressure monitoring system. Air conditioning, AM/FM/CD audio system, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, and keyless entry are offered as part of a value package. Anti-lock brakes with electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist are optional ($250) on top of the value package.

When it was introduced in fall 2008, the Versa&#x27;s base price of US$9,990 made it the least expensive new car available in the United States, but a price cut to the Hyundai Accent usurped that distinction by $20. The Versa 1.6&#x27;s $12,498 Canadian base price also undercut its competitors at launch.

2010 models featured a redesigned grille and a new design for the 1.8S model&#x27;s wheel covers. In North America, the sedan was replaced by its second generation starting the 2012 model year (hence, 2011 being its last). The fate of the hatchback was however extended for one more year, 2012 being its last. Production of both for that market stopped in mid-2011.

The Tiida sedan was discontinued in Mexico, and was replaced by the new Versa in October 2019.

;Latin America
On 11 January 2008, Chrysler LLC and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. announced an agreement for Nissan to supply Chrysler with a new car based on Nissan Versa sedan for limited distribution in Latin America in 2009. The model was named as Trazo by Dodge and was revealed in São Paulo International Motor Show in Brazil. However the plan failed to materialise, as it coincided with the arrival of Fiat in Chrysler capital in early 2009.

=== Electric prototype ===
The EV-11 prototype electric car was based on Tiida and used an and electric motor, 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack rated distance, navigation system, EV remote control and monitoring.

The prototype vehicle was unveiled at Nissan&#x27;s Yokohama headquarters on 8 February 2009. Production version was set to begin sale in US and Japan in 2010.

== Second generation (C12; 2011) ==
The second generation, C12 series of the Nissan Tiida was unveiled in April 2011 at the Shanghai Auto Show. Sales in China commenced in June 2011. It is available only as a five-door hatchback, and is notably not sold in Japan. The C11 Tiida sedan was instead replaced by the Nissan Almera/Latio/Sunny/Versa (N17) and Nissan Pulsar/Sentra/Sylphy (B17). The C12 Tiida is in fact heavily related to the Sylphy B17—both base their construction on the Nissan V platform and share substantial mechanicals. The Thai manufactured versions even share the Sylphy B17&#x27;s interior, while the original Chinese and Taiwanese models feature a distinctive design. Powertrains also remain common between C12 and B17 models.

Instead of being sized and marketed as both a subcompact or a compact car depending on the country, the second-generation Tiida was marketed as a C-segment worldwide as the March/Micra hatchback and the N17 series sedan took the role to serve the B-segment market.

=== Marketing ===
;Asia
In Thailand, the Tiida hatchback is called the Nissan Pulsar, which went on sale by February 2013. The Tiida hatchback comes with &quot;MRA8DE&quot; 1.8-litre engine, which it shares with the Nissan Sylphy. In Taiwan, the Tiida hatchback is known as the &quot;Big Tiida&quot; in advertisement due to the size upgrade and went on sale in January 2013.

;Australia
In Australia, the Tiida name was dropped in favour of a return to using Nissan Pulsar, which was a very popular nameplate up to 2005.

The SSS high performance version with a 1.6-litre turbocharged engine arrived in late 2013. It was aimed at the &quot;warm&quot; hatch market which is a category placed between standard and hot hatches. It featured a 140 kilowatt turbocharged MR16DDT engine found in the Nissan Pulsar ST-S variant. It is also found in the Nissan Juke ST-S and TI-S. The engine was connected to either a close ratio 6-speed manual transmission or Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). Premium features included push start ignition, keyless entry, dusk sensing headlights, dual climate control and satellite navigation.

;Middle East
In the Middle East, the Tiida was available with a 1.6 or 1.8-litre engine.

=== Facelift (Taiwan) ===
Instead of updating to the C13 Tiida/Pulsar, the C12 Tiida was facelifted exclusively in the Taiwanese market conducted by Yulon Motors. The facelift was a budget update to keep the appearance of the C12 Tiida in Taiwan in line with the C13 Tiida in other markets. The facelift replaces the front and rear light units with redesigned set up and light strips, front and rear bumpers, and the front grille. The new front grille features the updated Nissan V motion styling and the rear bumper was designed to mimic those on the C13 Tiida.

==== Tiida J ====
The Taiwanese market Tiida received another facelift for the 2021 model year called the Tiida J. The Tiida J features redesigned front and rear bumpers.

== Third generation (C13; 2015) ==
Since March 2015, the Nissan Pulsar (C13), as sold in most of Europe, is sold in Russia, China and Africa under the Tiida nameplate.

<text>Daymond Randolph Langkow (born September 27, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre. He was the fifth overall selection of the Tampa Bay Lightning at the 1995 NHL entry draft. He played junior hockey with the Tri-City Americans in the Western Hockey League (WHL) and is their franchise record holder for career goals at 159. He won the Bob Clarke Trophy in 1995 as the WHL scoring leader with 140 points, and competed with the Canadian junior team at the 1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships where he won a gold medal.

Langkow made his NHL debut in 1995 with the Lightning, and also played for the Philadelphia Flyers, Phoenix Coyotes and Calgary Flames. He has scored 30 goals twice in his career, both with the Flames, and scored more than 50 points in eight consecutive seasons between 1999 and 2008. He was a nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in 1997 and has played over 1,000 games in the NHL. His older brother, Scott, was also a professional hockey player.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
Langkow was selected by the Tri-City Americans in the second round of the 1991 Western Hockey League (WHL) Bantam Draft. He completed the 1991–92 season with the Edmonton Pats of the Alberta Midget Hockey League, scoring 81 points in 35 games while appearing in one game with the Americans as a 15-year-old. He joined Tri-City full-time in 1992–93, scoring 22 goals and 64 points in 64 games and improved to 40 goals and 83 points in 1993–94. Langkow averaged nearly two points per game in 1994–95, scoring 140 points in 72 games. He was named the recipient of the Bob Clarke Trophy as the top scorer in the WHL, and was named to the WHL West and Canadian Hockey League First All-Star Teams. He finished as the runner-up to Marty Murray for the Four Broncos Memorial Trophy as the WHL&#x27;s most valuable player.

The Tampa Bay Lightning selected Langkow fifth overall in the 1995 NHL entry draft. On the eve of the 1995–96 season, the Lightning signed him to a three-year, $2.4 million contract. He made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut on October 7, 1995, against the Calgary Flames. Langkow appeared in four games with the Lightning before he was returned to Tri-City. He scored 91 points in 48 games with the Americans and was named to the WHL&#x27;s West Second All-Star Team. , he remains the Americans&#x27; franchise record holder for most career goals with 159. Langkow represented Canada at the 1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships where he won a gold medal.

===Tampa, Philadelphia and Phoenix===
Langkow rejoined the Lightning for the 1996–97 NHL season and scored 15 goals and 28 points in his rookie season. He scored his first NHL goal on November 19, 1996, against the Los Angeles Kings, and was named the NHL&#x27;s rookie of the month for February 1997. He fell to 22 points in 1997–98 and ended the season in a dispute with the Lightning when he refused a demotion to the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League. The Lightning suspended him indefinitely, but told the media they were not interested in trading him. He missed seven games and lost $63,000 in salary before the Lightning relented and recalled him to finish the season in Tampa. Langkow was assigned to the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League to begin the 1998–99 season amidst trade rumours but was recalled after four games. He was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers along with Mikael Renberg on December 12, 1998, in exchange for Chris Gratton and Mike Sillinger.

While he was considered a throw-in for the Flyers who made the trade to re-acquire Renberg, Langkow flourished in Philadelphia. He finished the season with 14 goals combined between Tampa and Philadelphia, and his development as a playmaking centre earned him the Pelle Lindbergh Memorial from his teammates as the Flyers&#x27; most improved player. They re-signed Langkow to a two-year contract extension following the season. He set new personal highs in goals and assists in 1999–2000, finishing with 50 points and helping the Flyers reach the Eastern Conference Final in the 2000 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Despite missing 11-games with two broken feet, Langkow improved to 54 points in the 2000–01 season.

The acquisition of Jeremy Roenick and Jiri Dopita by the Flyers in the summer of 2001 left Langkow, a restricted free agent, as the odd man out in Philadelphia. He was dealt to the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for a second-round draft pick in the 2002 NHL entry draft (Dan Sprang) and a first-round pick in 2003 (Jeff Carter). Unable to agree on a contract, Langkow and the Coyotes went to arbitration where he was awarded a two-year contract worth $4.2 million. He made an immediate impact with Phoenix, scoring his first career hat trick in a 5–2 victory over the Washington Capitals in the Coyotes&#x27; home opener. He finished the 2001–02 season as the team leader with 62 points. He fell back to 52 points in 2002–03, but scored his 100th career goal in his 500th career game on December 30, 2002, a 4–3 overtime victory against the Edmonton Oilers. He finished second in team scoring with 52 points, and served as an alternate captain for the Coyotes during the 2003–04 season.

===Calgary===
The Coyotes signed Langkow to a one-year, $2.95 million contract in August 2004, but dealt him to the Calgary Flames less than two weeks later for Oleg Saprykin and Denis Gauthier. The season, and the contract, were wiped out by the 2004–05 NHL lockout; Langkow did not play anywhere during the lost season. The Flames signed Langkow to a new contract prior to the 2005–06 season amidst high expectations as he was placed on the top line with captain Jarome Iginla. He finished the season second on the Flames in both goals (25) and points (59) and recorded his sixth consecutive season with 50+ points.

Langkow emerged as a top scorer for the Flames in 2006–07, becoming the team&#x27;s offensive leader while Iginla was sidelined for several weeks by a mid-season knee injury. He reached the 30-goal mark (33) for the first time in his career, finished with a career-high 77 points and was the Flames nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for dedication and sportsmanship. His teammates and coaches also praised his defensive ability, suggesting that he deserved a nomination for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defensive forward. Langkow remained a top two-way forward for the Flames in 2007–08, recording his second consecutive 30-goal season and finishing third on the team with 65 points. The Flames re-signed him to a four-year, $18-million contract extension though the 2011–12 NHL season.

Langkow scored only 49 points in 2008–09 and missed ten games as result of a hand injury. It was the first time in nine seasons that he failed to reach the 50-point mark. He suffered another hand injury in the 2009 playoffs, though he still played all six games against the Chicago Blackhawks. 

He played his 1,000th game, against his former club, the Tampa Bay Lightning, on February 6, 2010, one night after teammate Jarome Iginla reached the same mark. His offensive numbers continued to decline, as he finished the year with 14 goals and 37 points, his lowest totals in a decade. He missed the final ten games of the season after he was struck in the back of the neck by a slapshot during a game against the Minnesota Wild on March 21, resulting in a spinal cord injury. 

His efforts to return to the Flames lineup suffered a setback in late October 2010, shortly after the 2010–11 season began earlier in the month, after which a Flames official stated it was a &quot;50/50 proposition&quot; on whether he would ever play another NHL game. Following several months of rehabilitation, Langkow was cleared for light skating by a neck specialist, allowing him to begin practicing with his Flames teammates at the end of February 26, 2011, though he was still considered 2–3 months away from being able to continue his career. He joined the Flames for full practices a couple weeks later, and by March 19 – nearly one year to the day of his injury – Langkow expressed hope that he would be able to return to action prior to the end of the season. That hope became reality late in the year as he was activated off injured reserve by the Flames, who announced he would return to the lineup for an April 1 game against the St. Louis Blues, 376 days and 88 games after he suffered the injury. In the final four games after missing the first 78 games, he was goalless and had an assist for one point as the Flames narrowly missed the playoffs, missing by three points. For his efforts at coming back from injury despite the Flames missing the playoffs for the second year in a row, Langkow was a finalist for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy that was ultimately won by Ian Laperriere of the Philadelphia Flyers.

=== Phoenix ===
The Phoenix Coyotes re-acquired Langkow on August 29, 2011, in exchange for forward Lee Stempniak During the 2011–12 season, Langkow missed seven games in November after his mother died suddenly at the age of 54. On July 7, 2013, Langkow announced his retirement.

==Personal life==
Langkow is the second child of Randy and Vivian Langkow and grew up in Vegreville, Alberta. His parents divorced when he was ten years old. His father is a plumber in Edmonton, while his mother managed a restaurant in British Columbia prior to her November 2011 death.

Langkow and his wife Stephanie have four children, and expressed a desire to put down roots in the city of Calgary as a reason for his decision to sign a long-term contract extension with the Flames in 2008 rather than test free agency.

Langkow&#x27;s son, Colton Langkow, currently plays in the Western Hockey League for the Vancouver Giants.

Langkow&#x27;s older brother, Scott was a goaltender who played 20 NHL games for the Winnipeg Jets, Phoenix Coyotes and Atlanta Thrashers.

He also has a younger cousin, Chris Langkow, who is an ECHL All-Star and a Kelly Cup champion with the Alaska Aces, whom he frequently mentors and often gives advice.

<text>, also known as Grandizer, Ufo Robot Grendizer Raids, Goldrake and Goldorak, is a Japanese manga and animated television series created by Go Nagai. The series is the third entry in the &quot;Mazinger&quot; series, later relegated into a spinoff series. The series is produced by Toei Doga and Dynamic Planning, directed by Tomoharu Katsumata, and written by Shozo Uehara. It aired on Fuji TV from October 5, 1975, to February 27, 1977. The mecha&#x27;s first appearance in the United States was as a part of the Shogun Warriors line of super robot toys imported in the late 1970s by Mattel, then in Jim Terry&#x27;s &quot;Force Five&quot; series. A remake of the original anime series, &quot;Grendizer U&quot;, aired from July to September 2024.

== Plot ==

The Vega homeworld has become unstable due to the exploiting of Vegatron, a powerful radioactive ore. Seeking to expand his militaristic empire and find a substitute planet to settle upon, the ruthless King Vega unleashes his armies—composed of flying saucers and giant robotic monsters—and turns first against neighbors such as Fleed, a highly advanced but peaceful world. The once verdant, idyllic Fleed is turned into a radioactive wasteland. Too late, the only known survivor of the royal family, the Crown Prince Duke Fleed, manages to steal the Grendizer, the robotic embodiment of the Fleedian God of War, from the Vegan invaders who plan to use it to spearhead their invasion fleet. Grendizer is a giant monster robot that interfaces with Spacer (Spaizer), a flying saucer that enables the robot to fly.

Fleeing Vegan space by flying at faster than light speed, the Duke enters the Solar System and switches course to Earth, making a rough landing in Japan, on the slopes of Mount Fuji. He is befriended by Doctor Umon, a noted scientist who oversees a research laboratory called the Space Science Lab near a small ranch. The kindly Umon takes in the young humanoid alien as his son, under the assumed name of Daisuke, and assists him in hiding Grendizer. Taking the name Daisuke Umon, Duke Fleed works at the ranch run by Danbei Makiba (based on Abashiri Daemon of Go Nagai&#x27;s manga &quot;Abashiri Ikka&quot;).

Roughly two years later, Koji Kabuto, after studying abroad, returns to Japan in a flying saucer he personally designed and built, called the TFO. He heads to the Space Science Lab after hearing of multiple sightings of &quot;flying saucers&quot;. He plans to contact the aliens if possible and make peace with them. Daisuke, however, scoffs at the notion and fears that these aliens, the Vegans, led by generals Blaki and Gandal, are preparing to attack Earth. Koji ignores his warnings and flies out to meet the incoming saucers, only to discover the horrible truth. In order to save Koji and protect his adoptive homeworld from destruction, Daisuke is forced to return to his true identity as Duke Fleed. He unearths Grendizer from its hiding place under the lab and sets off to fight his enemies.

The Vegans establish a base on the far side of the Moon and start to attack Earth from there. Koji discovers Duke Fleed&#x27;s true identity and their bitter rivalry soon turns to friendship. The daughter of Danbei Makiba, Hikaru, also discovers Daisuke&#x27;s secret and becomes a pilot in order to assist him despite his objections. Later on, it is revealed that there were two more survivors from planet Fleed: Duke&#x27;s younger sister Maria Grace Fleed and a man who had rescued her and fled to Earth, raising her under the guise of her grandfather. Caught in a crossfire between Grendizer and a Vegan beast, he reveals to Maria that she is the last survivor of the royal family of Fleed (under the belief that Duke was killed) before dying from his wounds. Maria swears revenge on Grendizer and its pilot. She tries to ambush Duke, Koji and Hikaru at the Space Science Lab, but the fight is short. Maria&#x27;s attacks bring Duke&#x27;s necklace (which is the same as the one she wore) into view and the truth is revealed. The lost siblings are reunited at last and Maria becomes the last addition to the team.

As the conflict nears its end, it is shown that Duke Fleed was engaged to King Vega&#x27;s daughter, Princess Rubina, prior to the attack on Fleed. When Rubina discovers that planet Fleed is no longer polluted with Vegatron radiation and that her fiancé is alive and well, she rushes to Earth to bring him the good news. Unfortunately, one of King Vega&#x27;s generals uses this opportunity to ambush Duke Fleed, and Rubina is killed when she takes a shot aimed at Duke. This makes Duke even more determined to wipe out the Vegan menace once and for all.

King Vega decides to gather his remaining forces and make an all-out attack on Earth, destroying the Moon Base to coax his troops into fighting to the end and finally succeed in invading Earth and taking it as their new home planet. Duke and company go out to intercept them in Grendizer and the newly designed space combat Spazers. After a fierce battle, they finally manage to destroy the Vegan mother ship along with King Vega himself. Soon afterwards, Duke and Maria bid a tearful farewell to Earth and their friends and return to help reconstruct planet Fleed.

==Production==

&quot;UFO Robo Grendizer&quot;&#x27;s origins dates back to &quot;Uchu Enban Daisenso&quot; (宇宙円盤大戦争, &quot;Uchū Enban Daisensō&quot;), translated and also known as &quot;Battlefield of The Space Saucers&quot; and &quot;The Great Battle of the Flying Saucers&quot;, a 1975 animated short film created by Go Nagai and produced by Toei Doga. It is also known as &quot;Space Disk War&quot; and was also released in Italy under the name &quot;UFO Robot Gattaiger-La grande battaglia dei dischi spaziali&quot;. It was originally shown along with the short film &quot;Great Mazinger tai Getter Robot G: Kuchu Daigekitotsu&quot;, also from Toei and Nagai.

Nagai and Dynamic Productions created Grendizer using some of the elements and characters from Daiseno including Duke, the Makiba family, and even Blaki. Some changes were made to make it more original. The most obvious are the changes in design and the addition of characters such as Koji Kabuto and Maria Fleed.

&quot;UFO Robot Grendizer&quot; was developed to be a sequel to &quot;Great Mazinger&quot; after the initial concepts of a sequel were rejected by Toei. With the appearance of &quot;Uchu Enban Daisenso&quot; at the March 1975 Toei Manga Festival a remake was pitched using elements from &quot;Mazinger&quot;. To breathe new light into the series, the villains of the series were decided to be aliens, a trend that followed in other Toei mecha series while also making Duke a more Blue Blood character with his suit being based on a knight including more romantic elements with its characters and sense of adventure.

Go Nagai, however, at one point stated in an interview that the anime series was considered a fun side project and does not consider &quot;Grendizer&quot; to be part of the series timeline. This is mainly because he had many disagreements with Toei and Shingo Araki over the direction the show should take as well has Toei not paying him royalties for the show&#x27;s overseas airings, which culminated in a 1986 court settlement that lead to Toei paying Nagai his royalty earnings. In the end, &quot;UFO Robo Grendizer&quot; is more of a stand-alone spin-off in the &quot;Mazinger&quot; universe.

==Media==

===Anime===
The series was first aired on Fuji TV from October 5, 1975, to February 27, 1977, replacing &quot;Great Mazinger&quot; in its initial timeslot. Isao Sasaki performed both the show&#x27;s opening and ending themes: (with Columbia Yurikago-kai and Ko&#x27;orogi &#x27;73) and . Shunsuke Kikuchi composed the music for the series.

====Episodes====
====&quot;Grendizer U&quot;====
A reboot of the original anime series, titled , was announced on August 5, 2023. It was produced by Gaina and directed by Shun Kudō with Mitsuo Fukuda serving as chief director, Nagai serving as executive producer, Ichirō Ōkouchi overseeing and writing series scripts alongside Tatsuto Higuchi, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto designing the characters, Kō Inaba, AF_KURO and Junichi Akutsu providing mechanical designs and Kohei Tanaka composing the music.

The opening theme song is &quot;Kaishin no Ichigeki&quot; performed by Glay, while the ending theme song is &quot;Protect You&quot; performed by Band-Maid.

===Home media===
Toei released the entire series in Japan on DVD from May 21 to October 21, 2006. In 2013, following an agreement with Toei, an official &quot;fully remastered and uncensored&quot; DVD release of the complete series is available on French-speaking countries following the controversy regarding the unlicensed DVD releases by Manga Distribution and Déclic Images which resulted to a court ruling to pay €7,200,000 back to Toei. The series has also aired on the French Mangas anime TV channel. The entire Arabic dub is available on &quot;Istikana&quot;, a paid streaming service that has On-Demand Arab movies and TV shows.

===Manga===
The manga adaptation was serialized in several magazines in Japan, notably in Akita Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Boken Oh&quot; magazine from October 1975 to March 1977. A remake of the series, titled was serialized in Akita Shoten&#x27;s Champion Red magazine from September 2014 to July 2015. Two tankobon volumes were released.

Grendizer makes several cameos in other media, one in 2002 in the sixth chapter of &quot;Dynamic Superobot Wars&quot; and in 2004 in &quot;Dynamic Heroes&quot;, also known as and as &quot;Go Nagai Manga Heroes Crossover Collection—Dynamic Heroes&quot;, a Japanese manga based on several works of Go Nagai, including most of his most famous robots, such as Mazinger Z, Getter Robot and Great Mazinger. It was originally published as a monthly manga magazine e-manga from Kodansha, from June 2004 to July 2007.

===Video games===
Characters from the series also appeared in several installments of Banpresto&#x27;s (now Bandai Namco Entertainment) popular crossover video game series &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot;, making its debut in the second installment of the franchise, &quot;2nd Super Robot Wars&quot;. In recent years, however, Grendizer has made far less appearances in the mainline games but has recently been making a comeback starting with &quot;Super Robot Wars MX&quot;.

An open world action video game adaptation titled was announced by French video game publisher Microids in February 2021. The game was developed by Endroad and was released worldwide for Steam, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S on November 14, 2023, while it released in Japan on April 18, 2024. Nintendo Switch and Xbox One ports were released in October 2024.

===Toys===
Japanese Toy company Popy released several toys based on the mechs on the series in the show&#x27;s initial run in Japan under both the Chogokin and Jumbo Machinder labels, which were later released in the United States in the late 1970s by Mattel as part of the Shogun Warriors line of super robot toys.
The titular mecha is also included in Bandai&#x27;s line of &quot;Soul of Chogokin&quot; figures, starting with the GX-04 Grendizer.

==Cultural impact==

&quot;Grendizer&quot; was the second longest running animated &quot;Mazinger&quot; series in Japan, having 74 episodes. However, it has been criticized about its connection to the other &quot;Mazinger&quot; series in the franchise, especially with Koji&#x27;s status as a mere sidekick and giving him a different romantic interest who was not Sayaka, as well as the lack of the other &quot;Mazinger&quot; mechs.

This created the popular assumption that the anime was not a success in Japan, especially since the merchandise based on the anime did not sell as well as the merchandise for both &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; and &quot;Great Mazinger&quot;. However, Go Nagai disputes this, saying the anime was actually quite successful in Japan: “It was actually a hit in Japan. Maybe some people thought it was not as popular as &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, because &quot;Mazinger&quot; was super popular.” The average viewership metrics for &quot;UFO Robot Grendizer&quot;&#x27;s original Japanese broadcast was around 20.9% audience share across its 74 episodes with a peak share of 27.6% for Episode 21.

Regardless of its disputed success in Japan, &quot;Grendizer&quot; was one of the first anime programs to be a major success in both Europe and the Arabic regions of the Middle East, and continues to have a strong following in those parts of the world to this day. It only had limited success in the United States, where it was one of 5 mecha shows included in the 1980 TV anthology &quot;Force Five&quot;. The series was renamed &quot;Grandizer&quot; for the American market, and only had 26 episodes, which were run out of order. Despite the low episode count, it enjoys a small but dedicated cult following among East Coast American viewers who saw the show as children, as well as children who grew up with military families because &quot;Force Five&quot; was frequently aired on the cable TV feed of US military installations in Europe. This was also the version of the show broadcast in the United Kingdom, India, and the Philippines (though an earlier local Filipino English dub of the show existed before it was taken off the air by orders of the Ferdinand Marcos regime).

===Europe===
In Europe, Grendizer was a major success in France and Italy, known in both countries as &quot;Goldorak&quot; and &quot;Goldrake&quot; respectively. In Italy, the Italian dub theme songs were among the best-selling singles of 1978, with the first selling over 700,000 copies and the second selling over 1,000,000 copies. It would also get its own comic series titled &quot;Atlas UFO Robot Presenta Goldrake (Atlas UFO Robot Presents Goldrake)&quot;, whose story diverged even further from the source material. This comic ran for 89 issues and spawned several other similar comic adaptations of anime airing on Italian television at that time.

The French dub was the first anime series to be telecast in France and legend goes that the series was so popular among French viewers that several episodes scored a 100% TV rating. Like the Italian dub, it changed all of the characters’ names and inserted additional songs, although it did translate the series’ original opening and ending themes into French. Some versions of the dub have a completely different theme simply titled &quot;Goldorak&quot;, which was sung by Franco-Israeli singer Noam Kaniel. Kaniel&#x27;s performance earned him unprecedented celebrity status in France; by the time &quot;Goldorak &quot; had ended its original run on French TV, its theme song achieved platinum status in France. The Francophone dub was also one of the first anime programs to be a major success in Canada where it was broadcast on Quebec&#x27;s TVA network. The show continues to have a strong following, garnering widespread news coverage of its DVD release and return to broadcast TV in Canada. In October 2021 a fully licensed French-language &quot;Goldorak&quot; graphic novel was released by Editions Kana. According to the creative team, Go Nagai himself gave his blessings to the comics story, which serves as a sequel to the original Toei anime set 10 years after the final episode. The comic has received positive reviews from readers for its detailed art and a story that keeps the spirit of the original series. To coincide with the graphic novel&#x27;s release, the French postal company, La Poste issued stamps inspired by the anime.

&quot;UFO Robot Grendizer Raid&quot; was released theatrically as &quot;Goldorak&quot; and became a hit at the French box office, selling 922,964 tickets upon release in 1979.

===Arab World===
In Arab countries, the show was extremely popular, first airing in war-torn Lebanon on Télé Liban in 1979 under the title مغامرات الفضاء: يوفو - غرندايزر (&quot;Moughamarat Al Fada: UFO - Grendizer, Adventures In Space: UFO - Grendizer&quot;) before being distributed to most other Arabic speaking regions. Unlike the Italian and French dubs, the Arabic dub retained the characters’ names and kept songs from the Japanese version. Unlike most other Arabic dubs of anime, the show retained most of its plot details without any alteration or censorship in most Arabic-speaking markets, although some markets—such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE did censor certain scenes.

The Arabic language version of &quot;Grendizer&quot; was so popular when it first aired that it spawned several long-running &quot;Grendizer&quot; comics published for the Arabic market. Many of these were translations of the Italian-produced comics, the most well known of these being for the Lebanese comics anthology ما وراء الكون (&quot;Ma&#x27;Wara El Koun, Beyond The Universe&quot;). The magazine founded by Lebanese publisher Bassat Al Reeh (Flying Carpet) and headed by the company&#x27;s editor Henry Matthews, published Arabic translations of science fiction comics ranging from one-off short stories to licensed &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and Marvel superhero comics, as well as TV licensed comics adaptations like &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;. &quot;Grendizer&quot; did not make its appearance until the fifth issue, but was so popular that it became the top feature on the title, running for 140 issues. It later spawned its own comic series titled مغامرات غرندايزر (&quot;Moghamarat Grendizer, Grendizer Adventures&quot;) that ran for over 70 issues. The series&#x27; popularity continues on in the region, as Arab News journalist Hala Tashkandi stated; “&quot;Grendizer&quot; memorabilia still sell like hot cakes in the region, and its popularity has barely declined.” Lebanese pop star Sami Clark, who sang the Arabic version of the opening and ending in the Arabic dub, had frequently sung the theme in his concerts, including an orchestral rendering in 2018 
. Clark also performed a duet with the singer of the original Japanese themes, Issao Sasaki, at the 2019 Saudi Anime Expo. There&#x27;s even a store in Kuwait that started out mainly selling &quot;Grendizer&quot; merchandise, before expanding to selling other anime merchandise. In 2016, a Kuwaiti volunteer group made a &quot;Grendizer&quot; mural in Kuwait City during Urban Culture Week. Karim El Mufti, a professor of political science, said in his article about the anime, &quot;&quot;UFO Robo Grendizer&quot; has surpassed the initial expectations of its producers. Although the conversion works of the original Japanese version into Arabic had kept the Japanese phonetics, sites and cultural references, the cartoon has actually blossomed into a life of its own. As such, the domestication process of this character and of its whole narrative set was intimately connected to the Arab context and politics at the inception moment of the series, thus mirroring the deep preoccupations of the generations of that time. High exposure to violence, aggression, and injustice in the Middle East had established a hospitable environment for the super-powerful resistance figure and pro-justice hero.&quot; Go Nagai stated in an interview with &quot;Arab News&quot; that he believes the geopolitical climate in the Arab world played a big role in &quot;Grendizer&quot; becoming popular in Arab regions.

<text>Tonopah is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in western Maricopa County, Arizona, United States, west of downtown Phoenix off Interstate 10. The community is near the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, the largest power producer in the country, nuclear or otherwise. As of the 2020 census, the population of Tonopah was 23, down from 60 at the 2010 census.

It is located on the Tonopah Desert. Many wells in Tonopah are warm, in the to range, and many are hot; to wells are common. Prior to being called Tonopah, the settlement was known as &quot;Lone Peak&quot;.

The area is also known to have been inhabited by groups of people for resource gathering area of the Hohokam, Patayan, and Yavapai cultures.

== Demographics ==

As of the census of 2010, there were 60 people living in the CDP. The population density was 1.13 people per square mile. The racial makeup of the CDP was 87% White, 2% Native American, 3% Asian, and 8% from other races. Twenty-three percent of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Schools==
* Crossroads Academy
* Ruth Fisher Middle School
* Tonopah Valley High School
* Winters Well Elementary School

==Incorporation efforts==
In 2009, a political action committee named Tonopah United for Our Future (TUFF) filed paperwork with the county, proposing the incorporation of the area into a town. The proposal ran into difficulties when the neighboring town of Buckeye voted to publicly oppose the measure. State law forbids the incorporation of a new city or town within a specified distance of existing municipalities without their approval, and the proposed boundaries for Tonopah would abut the corporate boundaries of Buckeye, essentially giving Buckeye veto power over any incorporation efforts. In 2003, Buckeye had passed a measure approving of any future incorporation effort by Tonopah, but the town council rescinded the measure, citing concerns that the proposal would extend the new town&#x27;s boundaries east of the Hassayampa River and into area Buckeye intends to annex. Council members did indicate that they were open to future incorporation efforts using the river as a boundary.

Residents also expressed concern that the proposal was too ambitious and that the new town would be incapable of managing the of land included in the proposal. Geographically it would be among the largest in the state, while estimates placed the population of the proposed town at approximately 6,000. Additionally, a number of residents opposed the plan because they believed large tax increases would be necessary to fund a new government.

Ultimately the measure was defeated on March 10, 2009, by a vote of 523 against incorporation versus 356 in support.

In 2023, The Tonopah Incorporation Committee again initiated a voter referendum, that would allow Tonopah to incorporate in fall 2024. If incorporated as planned, Tonopah would have a population of 4,300

==Belmont==
In November 2017, media outlets reported that a company associated with billionaire Bill Gates purchased between Buckeye and Tonopah for $80 million. At the time, Gates&#x27;s company announced plans to create a &quot;smart city&quot; called Belmont on the site. As of 2023, no construction has begun.

<doc id="1255109" wikidata="Q1541700" url="?curid=1255109" title="Alfa Romeo Arna">
<text>The Alfa Romeo Arna (an acronym for &quot;Alfa Romeo Nissan Autoveicoli&quot;, meaning &quot;Alfa Romeo[-]Nissan motor vehicles&quot;, but also a female Italian name) (Type 920) is a hatchback produced by the Italian manufacturer Alfa Romeo Nissan Autoveicoli S.p.A. between 1983 and 1987. The company was founded on 9 October 1980, as a 50:50 joint venture between the Italian Alfa Romeo S.p.A. and the Japanese Nissan Motor Company.

==History==
On 9 October 1980, Takashi Ishihara of Nissan and Alfa Romeo President Ettore Massacesi signed a memorandum in Tokyo for increased cooperation between their two firms, and revealed their intent to create a joint production venture called AR.N.A. S.p.A. (Alfa Romeo Nissan Autoveicoli). Italian Prime Minister Francesco Cossiga endorsed the deal, despite political and auto industry opposition, because he hoped to bolster the fortunes of the state owned manufacturer, which had a cult following but was losing money.

The immediate priority of Alfa management, including Massacesi and managing director Corrado Innocenti was to field a competitor in the increasingly lucrative family hatchback market sector where the compact Volkswagen Golf and Lancia Delta were proving successful, and they hoped an alliance with Nissan would bring a competitive model to market faster and more cheaply.

During that period, European countries were engaging in protectionism to guard their domestic car industries, with France even banning the import of Japanese made vehicles. Working with Alfa Romeo, who controlled a respectable amount of European auto sales at the time was seen as a good hedge for Nissan and a chance to establish a foothold in the European market.
For the joint venture, a new plant was constructed in Pratola Serra, near Naples. The body panels of the car were constructed in Japan by Nissan, then shipped to Italy for final assembly. Nissan and Alfa Romeo also engaged in a commercial cabover truck, called the Romeo and rebadged as the Nissan Trade for a short time.

The product of the relationship was launched at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show; the car&#x27;s name was an acronym meaning &quot;Alfa Romeo Nissan Autoveicoli&quot;. The Arna was largely based on the N12 series Nissan Pulsar / Nissan Cherry but featured Alfa Romeo engines carried over from the Alfasud, as well as an Alfa transmission, steering, front brakes and front suspension.

It did however use an independent rear suspension and rear brakes from Nissan. The Arna was also briefly marketed as the Nissan Cherry Europe in the United Kingdom and Spain. Italian built cars badged as Nissan Cherry Europe can be readily identified by their rear lighting clusters, which match those of the Arna rather than the Japanese built Cherry.

Although no variants of the Italian built Arna were ever sold in Japan, a domestic version of the N12 Nissan Pulsar, labelled the Nissan Pulsar Milano X1, made use of the Alfa Romeo connection in its publicity and was fitted with the same black and green interior as the Arna Ti or Cherry Europe GTi. The model was entirely N12 based, though, and featured the usual transversely mounted the infamous Nissan E engine.

While British Leyland and Honda had a limited partnership in the United Kingdom at that time, the Nissan and Alfa Romeo alliance was the first of its kind between a European and Japanese automaker with joint investment in manufacturing and development. It was feared by the European Economic Community and ironically, Alfa&#x27;s future parent Fiat, that the success of this partnership would create a Trojan horse, enabling Japanese automakers to compete &quot;unfairly&quot; in Europe, and thereby take sales away from other European auto-makers.

However, such fears were quickly allayed upon the Arna&#x27;s release when it became obvious that the Arna exhibited the worst qualities of each of its parents. The Arna featured tempestuous mechanicals, rust prone bodywork and indifferent build quality courtesy of Alfa Romeo, married to a Nissan body of questionable build and frumpy, box like styling, with insipid handling common to Japanese cars of the time.

This mismatch of technical strengths served to kill the sales of the Arna very rapidly. As the car gained a reputation for poor build quality and questionable reliability, sales of the Nissan badged Cherry Europe sister car also nosedived, as loyal Nissan customers shunned it in favour of the &quot;genuine&quot; Japanese built Cherry instead.

By 1986, Alfa Romeo&#x27;s parent company, the Italian government owned Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale was suffering from heavy losses, and IRI president Romano Prodi put Alfa Romeo up for sale, with Fiat ultimately emerging as the new owner of Alfa. Fiat&#x27;s first decision was to cease Arna production owing to its poor reputation and poor sales, and to terminate the unsuccessful Alfa Romeo Nissan alliance. Production ceased in 1987, with Fiat intending to strengthen the competitiveness of the Alfa Romeo 33 as Alfa&#x27;s entry in that segment. By this time, Nissan had set up a European operation of its own at Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK in Sunderland, which became hugely successful.

==Models==

The Arna was initially sold as a three-door L and a five-door SL, and was fitted with the Alfasud 1.2 boxer engine (63 PS). In 1984, a three-door TI version, with an 1.3-litre boxer four engine, was introduced, which was capable of reaching a top speed of . In November 1984 (model year 1985) came a more powerful 1.2 engine in the same trim configurations with , while there were no external differences there were light alterations to the interior.

Later, there were also some TI trim cars built with 1.5-litre engines, sold also as the Nissan Cherry Europe GTI. The more powerful 1.5 TI/Cherry GTI had a top speed of . The TI version was discontinued halfway through 1986.

==Today==
In June 2000 (when Jeremy Clarkson famously blew one up on &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s Car Years&quot;), it was reported that only 34 Alfa Romeo Arnas were still registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in United Kingdom.

As of August 2018, there were only three Arnas shown as registered in the United Kingdom, a 1.2SL and two 1.5Ti&#x27;s, although up to four cars are believed to exist in total. Both of the Arnas recorded are listed with SORNs, meaning that they are no longer legally driven on public highways.

<doc id="1255113" wikidata="Q4934444" url="?curid=1255113" title="Bob Wood (Ontario MPP)">
<text>Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Wood, (born October 10, 1949) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was as a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003 who represented the southern Ontario ridings of London South and London West.

==Background==
Wood was educated at the University of Western Ontario, receiving a law degree in 1970. He practiced law in London, Ontario after his graduation, and was the proprietor of the firm Walker and Wood. He also served on the Board of Managers for St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, and was the Board Chairman for the Western Ontario Therapeutic Community Hostel.

==Politics==
Wood ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1990, placing third in London South against incumbent Liberal Joan Smith and the winner, New Democrat David Winninger. He ran in the same riding in the 1995 provincial election, and easily defeated Winninger and Smith to become the riding&#x27;s MPP. In the provincial election of 1999, he was re-elected over Liberal candidate Darrel Skidmore by only 294 votes in the redistributed riding of London West.

Wood was regarded as a maverick right-winger in the Progressive Conservative caucus. He supported the Reform Party of Canada at the federal level, and holds socially conservative opinions on several issues, including abortion. During his first term in the legislature, he introduced a private-member&#x27;s bill which would have mandated a 45-day waiting period for couples wishing to marry, unless they agreed to eight hours of counselling. He also criticized a government grant to Anti-Racist Action in 1999, describing the group as a leftist organization given to violence. It was probably for these reasons that Wood was never appointed to cabinet by Mike Harris or Ernie Eves. Wood also criticized his government&#x27;s plan to reform the provincial system of legal billing.

Wood lost his seat to Liberal Chris Bentley by over 10,000 votes in the 2003 provincial election. He remains politically active in the London region, and in November 2004 criticized the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty for its handling of London&#x27;s hospital system.

Wood supported Frank Klees for the leadership of the Ontario PC Party in 2004.

<text>Brian Raymond Tamaki (born 2 February 1958) is a New Zealand Christian fundamentalist religious leader, and politician. He is the leader of Destiny Church, a Pentecostal Christian organisation which advocates strict adherence to fundamentalist biblical morality. Tamaki has been involved with various fringe political parties and movements, and since 2022 he has led the Freedoms New Zealand party. A perennial candidate, he has run for office several times but has yet to be elected.

Founded by Tamaki in the 1980s, the Destiny Church is known for its position against homosexuality, its patriarchal views, and for its calls for a return to biblical conservative family values and morals. Tamaki has also stated the COVID-19 pandemic is a sign the world has &quot;strayed from God&quot;. This, alongside many comments he has made, has made him a controversial figure in New Zealand.

Tamaki&#x27;s church and his political involvements have pushed a strong campaign that opposes COVID-19 vaccination, lockdowns and mask mandates since the pandemic began in New Zealand, and engaged in protests against mandates at Parliament, including the 2022 Wellington protest. In 2022 Tamaki was briefly imprisoned for breaching bail conditions as he took part in an anti-mandate protest in Christchurch.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
In his autobiography &quot;Bishop Brian Tamaki: More than meets the eye&quot;, Tamaki makes the following statements about his early life:

Born in Te Awamutu in the Waikato region as the eldest in a family of five, Tamaki spent his childhood years on the family farm, called &quot;Te Manuka&quot;, in the rural area of Te Kopua. His mother was &quot;devoutly religious&quot;, taking her sons to the Te Awamutu Methodist Church on Sundays. Tamaki describes his father as an alcoholic who showed no interest in fatherhood. Tamaki is of Tainui ancestry, from the Ngati Ngawaero and Ngāti Maniapoto tribes. During Tamaki&#x27;s childhood the family moved from the farm to Te Awamutu and then on to Tokoroa in 1970. While in Tokoroa, Tamaki became interested in rugby union and a little later came to enjoy pig-hunting and participating in a rock band playing the pub circuit. Two of Tamaki&#x27;s brothers, Doug and Mike, are tourism venture operators in Rotorua.

Tamaki dropped out of secondary school at fifteen, after, as he describes in his autobiography, dabbling in drugs, before completing the fourth form and took a labouring job in the forestry industry. In his teens Tamaki began a relationship with Hannah Lee and the unwed couple moved to Te Awamutu, where Tamaki worked on a dairy farm owned by his uncle and aunt. An incident occurred where Lee tried to stab Tamaki to death. It is reported that he had to lock himself in the bathroom but that the blade pierced through the door, nearly wounding him. Tamaki and Lee had their first child, in December 1978. Later at 21, Tamaki joined the Ngāruawāhia Apostolic Church. He lost his farm job and he and Lee returned to Tokoroa, where he attended the Tokoroa Apostolic Church. Tamaki became heavily involved with the church after pastor Manuel Renata baptised him in December 1979. Since Tamaki and his partner had not married, Renata would not allow him to carry out all the functions of the church. Tamaki and Lee then married at the Tokoroa Presbyterian Church on 22 March 1980. Fourteen months later they had their second child, a girl.

=== Destiny Church ===

In 1982 the Tamakis attended the Apostolic Church&#x27;s Te Nikau Bible College in Paraparaumu, and also had their third child, Samuel. Tamaki became an ordained elder, and then (in September 1984) a pastor in the Tokoroa Apostolic Church. Tamaki went on to establish the Rosetown Community Church in Te Awamutu, the Lake City Church in Rotorua, City Church and then Destiny Church in Auckland.

On 18 June 2005 kaumātua and Destiny Pastor Manuel Renata ordained Tamaki as bishop of the Destiny Church movement (which at the time totalled 15 churches throughout New Zealand and Australia).

Tamaki advocates prosperity theology, which has been criticised as immoral and potentially dangerous.

In 2017 Brian Tamaki and Hannah Tamaki moved into a 234 square metre house in Drury, South Auckland. While it is the residence of Brian Tamaki and his family they are not legally connected to the home and only reside there. In response to criticism that moving into a house of such size was an overreach of his wealth, Tamaki responded &quot;Jealousy is part of the promotion of god&quot;.

In mid-April 2018, it was reported that Tamaki had sustained two second-degree burns to his face and body after a botched attempt to burn rubbish. Tamaki announced to members of his congregation that he was recovering and praised his wife and hospital staff for aiding his recovery.

In February 2021, &quot;The Otago Daily Times&quot; noted that he was being styled &quot;Apostle Bishop&quot; and that church members who paid various fees could be styled &quot;Apostle&#x27;s Sons&quot;.

In late July 2022, it was reported that Tamaki was facing a charge of careless driving after crossing the centre line and colliding with a car carrying two occupants near Rotorua on 6 May 2022. He pleaded guilty to careless driving and was ordered to pay reparations.

== Church and politics ==
In 2004, Tamaki predicted the Destiny Church would be &quot;ruling the nation&quot; before its tenth anniversary in 2008. A year earlier, in 2003, several members of the Destiny Church started the Destiny New Zealand political party, led by Richard Lewis. The party fielded 42 candidates in the 2005 general election, but garnered 0.6 per cent of the vote, short of the 5 per cent threshold required to enter Parliament without winning an electorate seat. None of its candidates came close to being elected.

Destiny New Zealand was promoted by a nationwide tour and DVD labelled &quot;A Nation Under Siege&quot;. Tamaki features in the DVD and accompanied the tour. The DVD shows Tamaki decrying what he sees as four problems with New Zealand society: &quot;a Government gone evil, a radical homosexual agenda, the media: a modern day witchcraft&quot; and &quot;the retreat of religion in New Zealand&quot;.

In his autobiography Tamaki wrote a chapter titled &quot;Spiritual Father – a long time coming&quot;, in which he described meeting &quot;my spiritual father&quot;, Eddie Long, in 2002. In October 2003, Long visited New Zealand after Tamaki invited him to address Destiny Church members. Tamaki wrote, &quot;the ease of our connection and the confirmation of a date was entirely in line with Kingdom principle – when God speaks, do it&quot;. Long travelled to New Zealand again subsequently and Tamaki usually met him each year at church conferences.

On 23 May 2019 Tamaki launched a new political party, Coalition New Zealand, led by his wife Hannah Tamaki. Coalition New Zealand would not be an explicitly Christian party but would oppose abortion and homosexuality. The name of the party was deemed potentially misleading by the Electoral Commission and was subsequently renamed to Vision New Zealand.

On 23 August 2022 Tamaki launched Freedoms New Zealand, a new umbrella political party which includes the New Nation Party, Vision New Zealand, and the NZ Outdoors &amp; Freedom Party. On 13 May 2023, Tamaki announced that he would contest the 2023 New Zealand general election as the leader of Freedoms New Zealand.

During the 2023 general election held on 14 October, Freedoms NZ failed to get into Parliament, attracting only 9,586 votes (0.33%). Following the release of preliminary results, Tamaki defended the anti-abortion stance of the unsuccessful National Party candidate Simon O&#x27;Connor, describing New Zealand Christians as &quot;gutless.&quot;

== Media engagement ==
At the Nelson meeting of the Destiny New Zealand &quot;A Nation Under Siege&quot; tour, Tamaki attacked the media, the government, the Green Party and Grey Power (a lobby group for the elderly), referring to the Greens as &quot;pagans&quot;, Grey Power as &quot;self centred&quot; and the media as &quot;modern day witchcraft&quot;.

In 2004 the &quot;Sunday Star-Times&quot; reported that Mr Tamaki &quot;hijacked&quot; $450,000 from elderly couple Barry and Marian Wilson. The Wilsons lent the money, which they had received from the sale of nautical clothing label Line7 in the mid-&#x27;90s, on the understanding that it was to be used to purchase a block of land in Rotorua for the construction of a church. It was reported that after almost 10 years and countless attempts to contact Mr Tamaki and his wife Hannah, the Wilsons had given up hope of ever recovering the full amount. The &quot;Sunday Star-Times&quot; asked Mr Tamaki for a response to a series of questions regarding the loan, but he declined to respond.

In 2004 &quot;Sunday&quot; broadcast a documentary of Tamaki and of the Destiny Church. Dr Philip Culbertson of the University of Auckland said: &quot;As far as I can tell it&#x27;s a cult&quot;.

In July 2005 Tamaki had directed &quot;highly offensive abuse&quot; at Newstalk ZB host Mike Yardley while off-air during an interview on 20 July.
In his autobiography Tamaki denies that the abuse happened.

In May 2006 a poll ranked Tamaki the least-trusted of 75 prominent New Zealanders.
In June 2006 Tamaki expressed opposition to Sue Bradford&#x27;s private members Child Discipline Bill, which removed the legal defence of &quot;reasonable force&quot; for prosecutions of parents who have assaulted their children.

In May 2007 the Reader&#x27;s Digest &quot;Most Trusted People&quot;&#x27; poll again ranked Tamaki as New Zealand&#x27;s least trusted of 75 prominent persons, followed by Ahmed Zaoui and Don Brash. He was again ranked least-trusted in 2012 in a list of 100, this time followed by Hone Harawira and Kim Dotcom.

In July 2008 TV3 broadcast &quot;Inside New Zealand: The Life of Brian&quot;, a documentary by reporter Ross Jennings.

==Views and controversies==

===Cult allegations===
In a Close-Up TV interview on the subject Tamaki denied that his church is a cult stating that &quot;if we are a cult then the Catholics, the Presbyterians, the Methodists, the Baptists, and the Pentecostals are all cults as well. Because we believe – we have the same actual orthodox tenets of belief.&quot;
===Views on sexuality and marriage===
Radio Pacific host John Banks aired an interview with Tamaki that attacked a New Zealand AIDS Foundation&#x27;s &quot;takatāpui&quot; (Māori for LGBT-person) HIV-prevention project, in which Tamaki referred to traditional Māori pre-colonial intolerance for male homosexuality, painting a picture of a society which, he states, exterminated gay and lesbian people. However, many Māori academic authorities question the basis for this statement.

The broadcasting of Tamaki&#x27;s preaching against homosexuality on Television New Zealand has led to numerous complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Authority. Television New Zealand pulled the original opening episode of his series &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, because it &quot;had language and phrases that did not meet industry standards of accuracy, fairness and balance&quot;.

Tamaki does not recognise the sex-reassignment surgery of the transgender former MP Georgina Beyer: Tamaki referred to Beyer in his autobiography as a male.

On 16 November 2016, Brian Tamaki drew controversy when he made statements during a sermon that the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes were divine retribution for sinful behaviour including murder and homosexuality. These statements preceded the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake by a few hours. Tamaki&#x27;s comments were condemned by leading New Zealand public figures including the Mayor of Christchurch Bob Parker, Prime Minister John Key, and the Anglican bishop of Dunedin, Kelvin Wright. One Auckland-based critic Aaron Smithson also organised a Change.org petition calling on Prime Minister Key to revoke Destiny Church&#x27;s tax-free status. On 17 November, Tamaki responded by accusing the media of bias and sensationalizing his statements.

On 19 April 2018, Tamaki tweeted his support for Australian rugby union player Israel Folau&#x27;s comments condemning homosexuality.

In June 2019, he made an &#x27;apology&#x27; in front of representatives from the LGBT community who were invited on to stage to share their stories and ask for a bridging of the divide between the LGBT community and the church. He told his South Auckland congregation that he is sorry for any past comments that have offended the gay community, saying that some of his past comments were misinterpreted. But he said that he hasn&#x27;t changed his beliefs, and doesn&#x27;t agree with homosexual acts. This apology came only one week after his wife launched a political party Vision NZ (then called Coalition New Zealand).

===Views on women in politics===
Tamaki regards the perceived lack of male leadership in New Zealand, including the leadership over one&#x27;s family, as &quot;the work of the devil&quot;. According to Tamaki Parliament reflects this alleged lack of male leadership. In his autobiography he defends his attitude towards women by pointing to the role of his wife Pastor Hannah Tamaki in the Destiny Church organisation, and also says &quot;God is very specific about the role and function of men&quot;. He has also said that he wants to appoint a Minister for Men.

Trans woman MP Georgina Beyer confronted Tamaki at the &quot;Enough is Enough&quot; protest in Wellington in August 2004, charging &quot;Your hatred is totally intolerable&quot;. Beyer also compared Tamaki to despots like Robert Mugabe in a &quot;3 News&quot; interview.

===Views on Islam===
Following the Christchurch mosque shootings in March 2019, Brian Tamaki issued a Tweet protesting at Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern&#x27;s decision to hold an Islamic call to prayer ahead of the two minutes of silence being held for the victims of the Christchurch shootings on 22 March 2019. Tamaki also made remarks attacking Islam as a &quot;false religion&quot;.

===Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic===

During the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, Tamaki courted media attention and controversy in mid-March 2020 when he announced that Destiny Church would not be closing their churches in response to Government directives discouraging gatherings of more than 100 people. Tamaki stated that he was &quot;not about to let a filthy virus scare us out of having church. To equate fear with common sense is nonsense.&quot; He said that &quot;... very ignorant Kiwis don&#x27;t even realise their rights have been stolen&quot;. Tamaki&#x27;s remarks were criticised by infectious diseases expert Siouxsie Wiles for undermining COVID-19 containment efforts.&quot; While Destiny Church held services on 22 March, they subsequently shifted to online services to comply with national lockdown restrictions.

In mid-2020, Tamaki criticized the Government&#x27;s alert level two restrictions limiting religious services to 10 people. Describing the Government as &quot;controlling parents,&quot; Tamaki announced that Destiny Church would be holding services in defiance of lockdown regulations and also called upon other New Zealand churches to join him in opposing these restrictions.

In early March 2021, Tamaki and his wife Hannah attracted media coverage and public criticism after they left Auckland during a Level 3 lockdown and visited Rotorua in the North Island and Te Anau in the South Island, which were both under a Level 2 lockdown. The COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins described the Tamakis&#x27; actions as &quot;completely irresponsible.&quot; The Mayor of Invercargill Tim Shadbolt stated that the Tamakis were not welcome in the South Island city. That same month, Tamaki had defended Hannah&#x27;s Facebook post stating that she would not take any COVID-19 vaccine, declaring they were not &quot;anti-vaxxers&quot; or conspiracy theorists.

On 2 October 2021, Tamaki along with The Freedoms &amp; Rights Coalition (TFRC) staged an anti-lockdown protest outside the Auckland War Memorial Museum in the Auckland Domain. The protests attracted thousands of demonstrators, including gang members on motorbikes, young children and elderly, many of whom were not following social distancing rules or wearing masks. The protesters were criticised for flouting lockdown restrictions and endangering public health by ACT Party leader David Seymour, Auckland Council councillors Jo Bartley and Richard Hills, and Jacinda Ardern.
The New Zealand Police&#x27;s delay in laying charges against Tamaki drew criticism, with a Change.org petition calling for his prosecution attracting 65,000 signatures by 4 October. On 5 October, Tamaki was charged with breaching the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 and Alert Level 3 restrictions in relation to organising the protest. He appeared in court by video link on 12 October and pleaded not guilty. He was remanded on bail until a further appearance in January 2022. He was also banned from attending protests in breach of anti-COVID restrictions and from using the internet to encourage non-compliance.

Tamaki attended an anti-lockdown protest in Auckland on 16 October and was subsequently arrested for breach of bail conditions.

In early November 2021, Stuff identified Brian Tamaki as the &quot;founder and architect&quot; of the anti-lockdown &quot;The Freedom and Rights Coalition&quot; (TFRC) protest movement, which had organised nationwide anti-lockdown and anti-vaccination protests. The Stuff report also identified Jenny Marshall, Destiny Church&#x27;s director of operations and Tamaki&#x27;s assistant, as the owner of TFRC&#x27;s web domain. Marshall confirmed that Tamaki was the leader of the TFRC but stated that the Coalition&#x27;s merchandising and donations were separate from the Church&#x27;s finances. In addition, Stuff reported that Brian and Hannah Tamaki maintained links with Groundswell NZ&#x27;s Pukekohe and Auckland coordinator Scott Bright, who donated vegetables to the TFRC and participated in an anti-lockdown protest in his personal capacity.

On 23 November, Brian and Hannah Tamaki were summoned to the Auckland Central Police station for attending the Auckland Domain protest held on 20 November in breach of the form&#x27;s bail conditions. In response, 100 supporters gathered outside the Police station in solidarity with the Tamakis. Brian denied breaching bail conditions and criticised the Government&#x27;s COVID-19 Protection Framework. Auckland District Court Judge Steve Bonnar altered Tamaki&#x27;s bail conditions to explicitly bar him from the Auckland Domain and from speaking at gatherings deemed unlawful by law enforcement authorities. Following an appeal, High Court Justice Geoffrey Venning allowed Tamaki to visit the Auckland Domain and Auckland Museum for recreational purposes but not protests. Tamaki was scheduled to face trial in April 2022.

On 27 December, the Police launched another investigation of Tamaki after he threatened to blow up mobile vaccination clinics in opposition to the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines to children between the ages of 5 and 11. According to &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;, Tamaki had made this alleged threat during a sermon held on 26 December, which was uploaded on Destiny Church&#x27;s website.

On 8 January 2022, Tamaki addressed an anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine mandate rally in Christchurch&#x27;s Hagley Park, which he described as a &quot;family picnic&quot; rather than a protest. In response, Police launched an investigation into whether Tamaki had breached his bail conditions.

On 17 January 2022, Tamaki was arrested for allegedly breaching his bail conditions. Police have previously stated they were investigating an anti-vaccine mandate rally held at Christchurch&#x27;s Hagley Park on 8 January. Tamaki is not allowed to &quot;organise or attend&quot; any protest encouraging non-compliance with the Covid-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. In response, Tamaki denounced the arrest and commented that he was a political prisoner.
Tamaki was remanded in custody for ten days for allegedly breaching his bail conditions by attending the Christchurch protest.

Supporters from Destiny Church and the Freedom and Rights Coalition camped outside Mount Eden Corrections Facility for several days. On 22 January 2022, six pastors including City Impact Church pastor Peter Mortlock and pastors from the Grace Churches in Gisborne, Tauranga, and Rotorua, Auckland&#x27;s Covenant Church and South City Reformed Baptist Church objected to Tamaki&#x27;s imprisonment, writing that he had been silenced for his dissenting views. Following nine days of imprisonment, High Court judge Paul Davison ruled in favour of Tamaki&#x27;s appeal that the decision to remand him in prison was wrong. Davison granted Tamaki bail but barred him from attending, organising, supporting and speaking at future anti-lockdown protests and ordered him to reside at home on a 24 hour curfew.

In early November 2024 Tamaki, his wife, his executive, and one other man faced trial at the Auckland District Court on charges of organising a series of large public gatherings between September and October 2021 in contravention of Level 3 restrictions at the time. Tamaki and his co-defendants were defended by Ron Mansfield KC, who argued that the defendants did not intentionally break lockdown rules and that the group were unfairly targeted by Police. In mid-November, Judge June Jelas agreed to dismiss all charges except two against Tamaki and two against a second co-defendant. On 20 November Jelas, with the approval of the Crown prosecutor, dismissed the remaining charges against Tamaki and the co-defendant.

===TFRC protests===
On 23 July, Tamaki&#x27;s Freedom and Rights Coalition staged protests in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch to protest against various problems in New Zealand society including rising living costs, violence, housing shortages, healthcare sector strains, and excessive government farming regulations. Tamaki addressed protesters in the Auckland Domain. Protesters disrupted traffic in Auckland and Wellington. Following the 23 July protests, Tamaki announced plans to establish a new coalition with three minor parties to contest the 2023 New Zealand general election. On 16 August, Tamaki and his wife Hannah were issued with traffic infringement notices for causing traffic disruption during the 23 July Auckland protest.

On 6 August, Tamaki led another TFRC protest known as the &quot;patriots day and march&quot; at the Auckland Domain. The TFRC protesters were met by counter-demonstrators led by Mark Graham. Police kept peace between the two rival groups and sealed the Southern Motorway&#x27;s ramps at Khyber Pass Road to prevent TFRC protesters from marching onto the highway and disrupting traffic.

On 23 August, Tamaki led a protest march outside the New Zealand Parliament in Wellington, which attracted between 1,500 and 2,000 protesters. They were met by 500 counter-protesters led by Pōneke Anti-Fascist Coalition. According to Wellington District Commander Superintendent Corrie Parnell, protesters, counter-protesters and the public were generally well behaved with no reported problems, arrests, or trespass orders being issued. During the Parliament protest, Tamaki launched a new umbrella political party called &quot;Freedoms NZ&quot; which consists of the New Nation Party, Vision New Zealand, and the NZ Outdoors &amp; Freedom Party.

On 28 September 2023, Tamaki and his wife Hannah led a TFRC protest against a scheduled &quot;Agenda 2030&quot; conference at the New Zealand Parliament in Wellington. They along with Outdoors Party leader Sue Grey addressed the protesters. Members of the Pōneke Anti-Fascist Coalition staged a counter-protest outside Parliament. The Coalition&#x27;s march coincided with similar protest activities in Wellington organised by Julian Batchelor&#x27;s Stop Co-Governance movement, the farming advocacy group Groundswell NZ, and a gang hīkoi protesting against the National and ACT parties&#x27; anti-gang policies.

===Response to Cyclone Gabrielle===
In March 2023, Tamaki blamed pornography, abortion, and gay rights for the devastation in the eastern North Island caused by Cyclone Gabrielle. Tamaki made these statements during an hour long sermon based on the Old Testament Book of Leviticus. He stated that Gisborne and Hastings had the highest number of pornography consumers in New Zealand. Tamaki&#x27;s remarks were condemned by Mayor of Gisborne Rehette Stoltz, who described them as &quot;disappointing, unhelpful and laughable.&quot;

===2023 Israel-Hamas war===
During the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, Tamaki led a pro-Israel rally outside the grounds of the New Zealand Parliament on 7 December, which attracted 400 supporters. Tamaki&#x27;s group opposed calls for a ceasefire and submitted a petition to ACT MP Simon Court calling for Hamas and Hezbollah to be classified as a terror organisations and for sympathetic Members of Parliament to be expelled. In response, members of the Poneke Anti-Fascist Coalition staged a counter-protest outside the Supreme Court building in Lambton Quay.

===Views on drag story events===
In mid-March 2024, Tamaki opposed two proposed Drag Queen Story Hour events at Rotorua and Hastings&#x27;s municipal libraries. Due to anti-drag queen opposition, these story events were cancelled. On 26 March, members of Destiny Church protested outside another drag storytime event at Gisborne&#x27;s library, who also painted over a rainbow crossing. 

On 15 April 2024, Ford O&#x27;Connor, a member of Destiny Church who is married to Tamaki&#x27;s granddaughter, pleaded guilty to vandalising the Karangahape Road rainbow crossing in Auckland in late March 2024 and was fined $16,093 to cover the repair costs. During the sentencing, Tamaki defended O&#x27;Connor, saying that &quot;he undertook a political protest against the excessive rainbow-washing that is occurring across New Zealand right now, at the expense of our taxpayers and our ratepayers.&quot; In mid-May 2024, Tamaki admitted responsibility for instructing his followers to vandalise the rainbow pedestrian crossing in Gisborne.

On 27 June 2024, Tamaki, Destiny Church&#x27;s trustees and several pastors were sued by drag performers Sunita Torrance and Daniel Lockett for inducing breach of contract, conspiracy to injure, unlawful means conspiracy, and defamation in relation to the disruption of their drag story events. In response, Destiny Church said it would continue to advocate for children&#x27;s well-being and accused the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; of promoting crowdfunding for the drag performers&#x27; legal case.

===Transgender issues===
On 5 May 2024, Tamaki denounced the use of puberty blockers for transgender children and youth people undergoing transitioning, according to Tamaki they were causing &quot;irreversible damage.&quot; He also opposed the appointment of Dr Sue Bagshaw as the Government&#x27;s lead investigator on the review of puberty blockers&#x27; suitability in New Zealand. The following day, he and Pastor Derek Tait led a protest by Destiny Church members against Te Tahi Youth health service in Christchurch, which helps transgender people access healthcare. Destiny supporters were met by counter-protesters while Police monitored the event. During a heated altercation, a teddy bear was thrown at Tamaki&#x27;s car.

On 14 May 2024, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that Tamaki was scheduled to speak at the upcoming &quot;UNSILENCED: Middle New Zealand on ideology&quot; at Wellington&#x27;s Tākina Convention Centre on 18 May alongside Family First New Zealand leader Bob McCoskrie and former National Party MP Simon O&#x27;Connor. The Convention Centre is owned and operated by Te Papa Museum and Wellington City Council. Protest groups Queer Endurance In Defiance and the Pōneke Anti-Fascist Coalition denounced the conference for allegedly promoting transphobia and said it was contacting the Council in order to cancel the event on safety grounds. While Wellington City Council Māori Ward Councillor Nīkau Wi Neera called for the event&#x27;s cancellation, New Zealand Free Speech Union chief executive Jonathan Ayling defended the conference on free speech grounds.

Following a safety review, Te Papa allowed the event to proceed, but said it would monitor the situation and expressed support for the LGBT community. Tamaki spoke at the Unsilenced conference, which was organised by Inflection Point NZ. O&#x27;Connor and British activist Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull (who participated via video-link) also spoke at the conference. 360 people attended the Unsilenced conference. A protest organised by Pōneke Anti-Fascist Coalition and Queer Endurance in Defiance attracted 500 people. A protester also released a bottle containing a foul-smelling substance outside the Convention Centre.

===Make New Zealand Great Again rally===
On 16 November 2024, Tamaki led a &quot;Make New Zealand Great Again&quot; motor rally in Auckland on 16 November in opposition to the Hīkoi mō te Tiriti. The group carried New Zealand flags, which they said was in opposition to the &quot;divisive&quot; Māori sovereignty flags of the Hīkoi to Parliament. The Make NZ Great Again rally caused traffic disruption on New Zealand State Highway 1 after several participants exited their vehicles and marched on the motorway. A spokesperson denied that Tamaki organised the rally. Tamaki also criticised Te Pāti Māori MP Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke&#x27;s haka against the first reading of the Treaty Principles Bill in Parliament, describing it as a &quot;Māori meltdown.&quot;

<text>The Russian Council of Ministers is an executive governmental council that brings together the principal officers of the Executive Branch of the Russian government. This includes the chairman of the government and ministers of federal government departments.

==Imperial Russia==

=== Committee of Ministers ===
The Ministries and the Committee of Ministers (Комитет Министров) were created in the early 19th century as part of the Government reform of Alexander I. The committee was an advisory board for the Emperor but could only consider matters referred to it by the monarch or when details for implementation of policy were brought to it by ministers. However, the committee had little collective power and did not make decisions, just recommendations. When the monarch presided personally over Committee meetings it was referred to as a council as the monarch had decision/policy making authority that the committee did not possess.

====Chairmen of the committee of Ministers (&quot;de facto&quot;), 1802 – 1810====
* Alexander Romanovich Vorontsov (1802–1804) as Imperial Chancellor and Foreign Minister
* Adam Jerzy Czartoryski (1804–1806) as Foreign Minister
* Andreas Eberhard von Budberg (1806–1807) as Foreign Minister
* Nikolay Petrovich Rumyantsev (1807–1810) as Foreign Minister

====Chairmen of the committee of Ministers, 1810 – 1905====
* Nikolay Petrovich Rumyantsev (1810–1812)
* Nikolay Ivanovich Saltykov (1812–1816)
* Pyotr Vasilyevich Lopukhin (1816–1827)
* Viktor Pavlovich Kochubey (1827–1834)
* Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev (1834–1838)
* Illarion Illarionovich Vasilchikov (1838–1847)
* Vasily Vasilyevich Levashov (1847–1848)
* Aleksandr Ivanovich Chernyshov (1848–1856)
* Aleksey Fyodorovich Orlov (1856–1861)

* Sergei Yulyevich Witte (1903–1905)

===Council of Ministers===
After Nicholas II issued the October Manifesto of 1905 granting civil liberties and a national legislature (Duma and a reformed State Council), the committee was replaced with a Council of Ministers. Unlike the Committee of Ministers, this council was presided over by a Chairman (Совет министров) besides the Emperor, and functioned as a policy making cabinet with its Chairman acting as Prime Minister (head) of the government. As a result, from 1905 to 1917 the Council of Ministers collectively decided the government&#x27;s policy, tactical direction, and served as a buffer between the Emperor and the national legislature.

The meetings of the council were in two parts, &quot;official and secret&quot;. The first followed a printed agenda; the second was devoted to the discussion of confidential questions, basic issues of policy and so forth.

* Sergei Yulyevich Witte (1905–1906)
* Ivan Logginovich Goremykin (1906)
* Pyotr Arkadyevich Stolypin (1906–1911)
* Vladimir Nikolayevich Kokovtsov (1911–1914)
* Ivan Logginovich Goremykin (1914–1916)
* Boris Vladimirovich Shtyurmer (1916)
* Alexander Fyodorovich Trepov (1916)
* Nikolai Dmitriyevich Golitsyn (1916–1917)

Nicholas&#x27;s hostility to parliamentarism emerged at the very beginning of his reign in 1894; to him, it would cause Russia to disintegrate. According to S. Kulikov: &quot;Nicholas was pursuing the entirely specific idea of gradually replacing absolutism with dualism, rather than with parliamentarism&quot;. On July 1, 1914, the Tsar suggested that the Duma – half of the deputies were nobles – should be reduced to merely a consultative body. On 24 August 1915 the Progressive Bloc, including the entire membership of the Duma, except the extreme right and the extreme left, was formed. It had the support of the press, the public opinion and, to a considerable extent, most of the Council of Ministers as well. The deputies tried to bring the Council &quot;uninterested in reform&quot; under control of the Duma, but their demands for a &quot;ministry of confidence&quot; were not received by the Tsar. 
In late 1915, there was a shortage of food and of coal in the big cities; Alexander Trepov was appointed as crisis manager in the Minister of Railways. Five key ministries would gather on a more regular basis to solve the transport question. In November 1915 Rasputin told Goremykin (or the obstinate Tsar) it was not right not to convene the Duma as all were trying to cooperate; one must show them a little confidence.
In January 1916, Rasputin was opposed to the plan to send the old Goremykin away, who had persuaded the Tsar to reject the proposals of the Progressive Bloc for a government of confidence.

On 20 January 1916 Boris Stürmer was appointed as Prime Minister &quot;to the surprise of everyone, and most of all Goremykin, who, as was usual with the Emperor, had never been given the idea that he was even in danger&quot;. According to B. Pares, Stürmer was prepared to pose as a semi-liberal and would try in this way to keep the Duma quiet. The new chairman of the council was not opposed to the convening of the Duma, as Goremykin had been, and he would launch a more liberal and conciliatory politic. The Duma gathered on 9 February, on the condition not to mention Rasputin. The deputies were disappointed when Stürmer made his indistinct speech. For the first time in his life, the Tsar made a visit to the Taurida Palace, suggesting he was willing to work with the legislature. According to Milyukov Stürmer would keep his further dealings with the Duma to a minimum.

Boris Stürmer was also appointed on the Ministry of Interior, the most powerful of all, which had under its control governors, police, and a Special Corps of Gendarmes, the uniformed secret police. He had risen to the status of virtual dictator. In the same month, Minister of War Alexei Polivanov, who in his few months of office had brought about a recovery of the efficiency of the Russian army, was removed and replaced by Dmitry Shuvayev. According to Victor Chernov, the campaign of the party of the Empress and Rasputin was waged steadily against the eight ministers who &quot;had resisted the removal of the commander in chief (Grand Duke Nikolai), and one after the other they were discharged&quot;.

Early July, Aleksandr Khvostov, Alexei&#x27;s uncle, not in good health, was appointed as Minister of the Interior and Makarov as Minister of Justice. Foreign Minister Sazonov, decisive when the war started, pleaded for an independent and autonomous Russian Poland. He was demoted on 10 July and the office given to Stürmer. On 21 July, the minister of agriculture Naumov refused to participate any longer in the government. According to Vladimir Gurko, the Council of Ministers as a whole declined continually in importance.

Around 6 September, Alexander Protopopov had been invited as Minister of the Interior. Placing the vice-president of the Duma in a key post might improve the relations between the Duma and the throne. Protopopov made himself ludicrious when he expressed his loyalty to the Imperial couple, and his contacts on peace and credit in Stockholm (without being authorized) became a scandal. When Protopopov raised the question of transferring the food supply from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of the Interior, a majority of the zemstvo leaders announced that they would not work with his ministry. His food plan was universally condemned by the Council of Ministers. 

==Soviet Russia==

The Sovnarkom of the RSFSR was the basis for all Soviet governments, including both Union and republican levels, until 1946, when all of the Sovnarkoms were renamed &quot;Councils of Ministers&quot;. With the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) fixed by law in the 1936 Soviet Constitution, the governments were little more than the executive bodies of the Central Committee of the CPSU. The CPSU&#x27;s leading role was also stated in the 1977 Soviet Constitution, and was not abolished until 1990.

==Russian Federation==

After the fall of the Soviet Union the Russian Council of Ministers became the chief body of administration for the President of the Russian Federation. At times it consisted of as many as 60 ministries and state committees and up to 12 Vice-Premiers. After the 2004 reform, Government duties were split between 17 Ministries, 7 Federal Services and over 30 governmental Agencies.

The Prime Minister is appointed by the President of Russia and confirmed by the State Duma. The chairman is second in line to succeed to the Presidency of Russia if the current President dies, is incapacitated or resigns.

<text>A maroon is a type of rocket which generates a loud bang and a bright flash. It is used as an alarm or warning. The British Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) used these rockets in the past to call the crew when the lifeboat needs to be launched. Another example was as a signal on a railway, to alert oncoming trains that they must stop due to unexpected accident or track work ahead. Used by British spotters in World War I located around the cities, they would fire when German bombers were approaching. Maroons were also intended to be used by the British Civil Defense or Royal Observer Corps in the event of a nuclear attack - the Protect and Survive series of informational civil nuclear defence videos shows the intended usage of maroons to signal impending fallout. Maroons would be used in groups of three to sound an alarm.

<doc id="1255131" wikidata="Q415392" url="?curid=1255131" title="Omalizumab">
<text>Omalizumab, sold under the brand name Xolair among others, is an injectable medication to treat severe persistent allergic forms of asthma, nasal polyps, urticaria (hives), and immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergy.
Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to free human immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood and interstitial fluid and to the membrane-bound form of IgE (mIgE) on the surface of mIgE-expressing B lymphocytes. Its primary adverse effect is anaphylaxis.
In 1987, Tanox filed its first patent application on the anti-IgE drug candidates. It took until 2003 in the United States until omalizumab was approved, and in Europe until 2005 for moderate to severe persistent asthma and severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. In February 2024, the FDA approved it also to treat severe food allergy.

== Medical uses ==
In the United States, omalizumab is indicated to treat moderate to severe persistent asthma, severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and chronic idiopathic urticaria, and as of February 2024, food allergy.

In the European Union, omalizumab is indicated to treat allergic asthma, chronic (long-term) spontaneous urticaria (itchy rash), and severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

In Australia, omalizumab is indicated to treat allergic asthma and chronic spontaneous urticaria.

===Allergic asthma===
Omalizumab is used to treat people with severe, persistent allergic asthma that is not controlled with oral or injectable corticosteroids. Those patients have already failed step I to step IV treatments and are in step V of treatment. Such a treatment scheme is consistent with the widely adopted guidelines for the management and prevention of asthma, issued by Global Initiative of Asthma (GINA), which was a medical guidelines organization launched in 1993 in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, US, and the World Health Organization. A 2014 Cochrane review found that omalizumab was effective in reducing exacerbations and hospitalisations related to asthma when used as an adjunct to steroids.

===Chronic spontaneous urticaria===
Omalizumab is indicated for chronic spontaneous urticaria in adults and adolescents (&gt;12 years old) poorly responsive to H1-antihistamine therapy. When administered subcutaneously once every four weeks, omalizumab has been shown to significantly decrease itch severity and hive count.

=== Food allergy ===
In February 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added an indication for immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergy for the reduction of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, which may occur with accidental exposure to one or more foods. Omalizumab can be used as a monotherapy or in combination with oral immunotherapy.

==Chemistry and formulations==
Omalizumab is a glycosylated IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced by cells of an adapted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The antibody molecules are secreted by the host cells in a cell culture process employing large-scale bioreactors. At the end of culturing, the IgG contained in the medium is purified by an affinity-column using Protein A as the adsorbent, followed by chromatography steps, and finally concentrated by UF/DF (paired ultra filtration/depth filtration).

== Mechanism of action ==
The rationale for designing the anti-IgE therapeutic antibodies and the pharmacological mechanisms of anti-IgE therapy have been summarized in articles by the inventor of the anti-IgE therapy.
Unlike an ordinary anti-IgE antibody, it does not bind to IgE that is already bound by the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) on the surface of mast cells, basophils, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect, which was not foreseen at the time when the anti-IgE therapy was designed and which was discovered during clinical trials, is that as the free IgE in patients is depleted by omalizumab, the FcεRI receptors on basophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells are gradually down-regulated with somewhat different kinetics, rendering those cells much less sensitive to stimulation by allergens. Thus, therapeutic anti-IgE antibodies such as omalizumab represent a new class of potent mast cell stabilizers. This is now thought to be the fundamental mechanism for omalizumab&#x27;s effects on allergic and non-allergic diseases involving mast cell degranulation. Many investigators have identified or elucidated a host of pharmacological effects, which help bring down the inflammatory status in omalizumab-treated patients.

===IgE in allergic diseases===
In conjunction with achieving the practical goal to investigate the applicability of the anti-IgE therapy as a potential treatment for allergic diseases, the many corporate-sponsored clinical trials of TNX-901 and omalizumab on asthma, allergic rhinitis, peanut allergy, chronic idiopathic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, and other allergic diseases, have helped define the role of IgE in the pathogenesis of these prevalent allergic diseases. For example, the clinical trial results of omalizumab on asthma have unambiguously settled the long debate on whether IgE plays a central role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Numerous investigator-initiated case studies or small-scale pilot studies of omalizumab have been performed on various allergic diseases and several non-allergic diseases, especially inflammatory skin diseases. These diseases include atopic dermatitis, various subtypes of physical urticaria (solar, cold-induced, local heat-induced, or delayed pressure-induced), and a spectrum of relatively less prevalent allergic or non-allergic diseases or conditions, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis, bee venom sensitivity (anaphylaxis), idiopathic anaphylaxis, eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorder, bullous pemphigoid, interstitial cystitis, nasal polyps, and idiopathic angioedema.

===Roles in non-allergic diseases===
Several groups have reported clinical trial results that omalizumab may be effective in patients with non-allergic asthma. This seems to be contrary to the general understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of the anti-IgE therapy discussed above. Furthermore, among the diseases in which omalizumab has been studied for efficacy and safety, some are not allergic diseases, because hypersensitivity reactions toward external antigens is not involved. For example, a portion of the cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria and all cases of bullous pemphigoid are clearly autoimmune diseases. For the remaining cases of chronic idiopathic urticaria and those of the different subtypes of physical urticaria, the internal abnormalities leading to the disease manifestation have not been identified. Notwithstanding these developments, it is apparent that many of those diseases involve inflammatory reactions in the skin and the activation of mast cells. An increasing series of papers have shown that IgE potentiates the activities of mast cells, while omalizumab can function as a mast cell-stabilizing agent, rendering these inflammatory cells less active.

==Adverse effects==
Omalizumab&#x27;s primary adverse effect is anaphylaxis (a life-threatening systemic allergic reaction), with a rate of occurrence of 1 to 2 patients per 1,000. A Cochrane review found injection site reactions to be the main reported adverse reaction.

Limited studies are available to confirm whether omalizumab increases the risk of developing cardiovascular (CV) or cerebrovascular disease (CBV). Cohort and randomised controlled studies have shown that the risk of developing CV/CBV disease is around 20–32% higher in patients taking omalizumab compared to those not taking omalizumab. Additional multi-national, longitudinal studies with increased subject numbers are required to provide further clarification into the relationship and clinical significance between omalizumab and CV/CBV disease. Due to the severity of CV/CBVs side effects, clinicians and health care providers should continue to remain vigilant and monitor side effects when treating patients with omalizumab.

IgE may play an important role in the immune system&#x27;s recognition of cancer cells. Therefore, indiscriminate blocking of IgE-receptor interaction with omalizumab may have unforeseen risks. The data pooled in 2003 from the earlier phase I to phase III clinical trials showed a numeric imbalance in malignancies arising in omalizumab recipients (0.5%) compared with control subjects (0.2%). A 2012 study found that a causal link with cancer was unlikely.

== History ==

In 1983, the product concept of anti-IgE antibodies against autologous IgE epitopes was discovered by perinatal monoclonal IgE immunization in rodents prior to the emergence of endogenous self IgE by Swey-Shen Chen at the Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and in Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), and later confirmed by Dr. Alfred Nisonoff at Brandeis University using monoclonal IgE in incomplete Freund&#x27;s adjuvant in perinates.

Tanox, a biopharmaceutical company based in Houston, Texas, started the anti-IgE program, created antibody drug candidates, and in 1987 filed its first patent application on the anti-IgE therapeutic approach. In 1988, the company converted one candidate antibody to a chimeric antibody (which was later named CGP51901 and further developed into a humanized antibody, TNX-901 or talizumab). The anti-IgE therapeutic concept was not well received in the early period of the program. Representatives of Ciba-Geigy (which merged with Sandoz to form Novartis in 1996) thought the anti-IgE program scientifically interesting and executives from Tanox and Ciba-Geigy signed a collaborative agreement in 1990 to develop the anti-IgE program.

In 1991, after several rounds of pre-IND (&quot;investigational new drug&quot;) meetings with officials/scientists of the FDA, the FDA finally allowed CGP51901 to be tested in human subjects. This approval of IND for an anti-IgE antibody for the first time was regarded a brave demonstration of professionalism for both the FDA officials and the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy team. The scientists participating in the pre-IND discussion comprehended that an ordinary anti-IgE antibody (i.e., one without the set of the binding specificity of CGP51901) would invariably activate mast cells and basophils and cause anaphylactic shock and probably deaths among injected persons. Notwithstanding this concern, they came to the same view that based on the presented scientific data, CGP51901 should have an absolutely required clean distinction from an ordinary anti-IgE antibody in this regard. In 1991–1993, researchers from Ciba-Geigy and Tanox and a leading clinical research group (headed by Stephen Holgate) in the asthma/allergy field ran a successful Phase I human clinical trial of CGP51901 in Southampton, England, and showed that the tested antibody is safe. In 1994–1995, the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy team conducted a Phase II trial of CGP51901 in patients with severe allergic rhinitis in Texas and showed that CGP51901 is safe and efficacious in relieving allergic symptoms.

While the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy anti-IgE program was gaining momentum, Genentech announced in 1993 that it also had an anti-IgE program for developing antibody therapeutics for asthma and other allergic diseases. Scientists in Genentech had made a mouse anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with the binding specificity similar to that of CGP51901 and subsequently humanized the antibody (the antibody was later named &quot;omalizumab&quot;). This caused great concerns in Tanox, because it had disclosed its anti-IgE technology and sent its anti-IgE antibody candidate, which was to become CGP51901 and TNX-901, to Genentech in 1989 for the latter to evaluate for the purpose of considering establishing a corporate partnership. Having failed to receive reconciliation from Genentech, Tanox filed a lawsuit against Genentech for trade secret violation. Coincidentally, Tanox started to receive major patents for its anti-IgE invention from the European Union and from the U.S. in 1995. After a 3-year legal entanglement, Genentech and Tanox settled their lawsuits out-of-court and Tanox, Novartis, and Genentech formed a tripartite partnership to jointly develop the anti-IgE program in 1996. Omalizumab became the drug of choice for further development, because it had a better developed manufacturing process than TNX-901. A large number of corporate-sponsored clinical trials and physician-initiated case series studies on omalizumab have been planned and performed since 1996 and a large number of research reports, especially those of clinical trial results, have been published since around 2000, as described and referenced in other sections of this article. In 2007, Genentech bought Tanox at $20/share for approximately $900 Million.

==Society and culture==
=== Legal status ===
Omalizumab was approved for medical use in the US in June 2003.

In October 2005, EMA issued the marketing authorization for omalizumab for the therapeutic indication of obstructive airway disease to Novartis.

The FDA approval of omalizumab for food allergy in February 2024 was based on the OUtMATCH trial, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study that evaluated its efficacy and safety in those allergic to peanut and two other foods, including milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut, or walnut. The FDA granted the application breakthrough therapy designation.

In March 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Omlyclo, intended for the treatment of severe persistent allergic asthma, severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The applicant for this medicinal product is Celltrion Healthcare Hungary Kft. Omlyclo is a biosimilar medicinal product. It is highly similar to the reference product Xolair (omalizumab), which was authorized in the EU in October 2005. Omlyclo was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2024.

=== Economics ===
In August 2010, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom ruled that omalizumab should not be prescribed on the National Health Service (NHS) to children under 12, as the high costs of the compound, over £250 per vial, did not represent a sufficiently high increase in quality of life. However, in March 2013, NICE issued &quot;final draft guidance&quot; about the allowance of omalizumab, recommending the medication as an option for treating severe, persistent allergic asthma in adults, adolescents and children following additional analyses and submission of a &quot;patient access scheme&quot; by Novartis, the manufacturer.

In August 2013, a senior Dutch researcher at Leiden University Medical Center responsible for the TIGER trial to treat rheumatoid arthritis was fired for research fraud. The TIGER trial was halted as a result.

 in the United States, omalizumab cost about to $4,600 per month.

<text>A CMoy is a pocket headphone amplifier originally designed by Pow Chu Moy.

The headphone amplifier is designed around single or dual-channel operational amplifiers (op-amps) such as Burr-Brown&#x27;s OPA2134 or OPA2132PA, however, a wide variety of op-amps have been successfully implemented. As the op-amp directly drives headphones, some care should be given when choosing an op-amp. Some op-amps are not suitable for such low impedance loads and will result in poor performance. (See Op-amp swapping.)

The amplifier&#x27;s design is quite simple. It consists of only a few components, can be assembled on a small section of protoboard, has a lower parts cost than other headphone amplifiers, and can run for many hours on a single 9 volt battery.

==Circuit==
A typical CMoy consists of two identical AC coupled, non-inverting operational amplifier circuits each with a 100kΩ input impedance.

Power is supplied to the opamps using a dual power supply, which effectively divides the input voltage source in half to create a virtual ground. Many virtual ground circuit options are presented in the various CMoy tutorials found online.

<text>Santiago Creel Miranda (; born on 11 December 1954) is a Mexican lawyer and politician, and a member of the National Action Party (PAN). Since 1 September 2021, he has been a federal deputy and the current president of the Congress of the Union and of the board of directors of the Chamber of Deputies. He served as Secretary of the Interior during the presidency of Vicente Fox Quesada, from 2000 to 2005. In 2006, he was elected senator to the Congress of the Union and served as President of the Senate of the Republic from 2007 to 2008. In 2016 he served as Constituent Deputy of Mexico City.

==Background and family life==
Creel&#x27;s campaign information describes him as a lawyer, father, and husband, as well as a Party loyalist.
Born to an American father of Mexican, English, Irish and Spanish descent, and a French mother of German, German Jewish (as Creel&#x27;s matrilineal lineage is Jewish, he should be considered to be a Jew by Jewish law), Spanish and Mexican ancestry, he is a
descendant of the Creel-Terrazas family via his father René Creel (1921–2009) who was one of the founders of the National Action Party. Creel has a long history with the PAN. In 2008, he admitted that he is the father of actress Edith González&#x27;s daughter, Constanza.

===Ancestry===
==Education==

Creel received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in law from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and subsequently completed graduate studies at Georgetown University and earned a master&#x27;s degree at the University of Michigan.

==Political career==

His career highlights include running for Head of Government of the Federal District in 2000 (a race he narrowly lost to Andrés Manuel López Obrador). He was later appointed to the cabinet by President Vicente Fox to serve as Secretary of the Interior, a position he held from December 2000 to June 2005.

On 1 June 2005, Creel presented Fox with his resignation in order to seek his party&#x27;s candidacy for the 2006 presidential election. Creel&#x27;s main contender for the PAN&#x27;s candidacy was Felipe Calderón who won the primary elections and went on to become President of Mexico.

In 2006, Creel received a proportional representation seat in the Senate to serve during the 60th and 61st Legislatures (2006–2012) and led the PAN Senate delegation until June 2008.

==2012 PAN presidential primary==

Santiago Creel decided to run for the PAN&#x27;s Presidential Nomination for the 2012 election and initially led polls ahead of the other candidates on the basis of his high profile, but subsequently lost the nomination to Josefina Vazquez Mota.

==Constituent Assembly of Mexico City==
Creel was one of seven PAN representatives elected by the voters of Mexico City to sit on the Constituent Assembly of Mexico City, which convened on 15 September 2016.

<doc id="1255149" wikidata="Q1360881" url="?curid=1255149" title="Alfa Romeo Alfasud">
<text>The Alfa Romeo Alfasud (Type 901, 902 and 904) is a small family car manufactured and marketed from 1971 to 1989 by Alfa Romeo as a front-engine, four-door, five-passenger entry-level model over a single generation — with facelifts in 1977 and 1980. There was also a two-door sedan, only available in &quot;ti&quot; trim. Alfa Romeo subsequently introduced a three-door wagon variant, the Giardinetta (1975); two-door coupé, the Alfasud Sprint (1976); three-door hatchback (1981) and finally the five-door hatchback (1982).

Assembly was primarily at the Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco plant, and 893,719 were manufactured from 1972 to 1983, with the addition of 121,434 Sprint coupé versions between 1976 and 1989. 

Developed by Austrian engineer, Rudolf Hruska, the Alfasud was noted for its boxer engine configuration, low center of gravity, aerodynamic profile, class-leading handling, styling by Giorgetto Giugiaro of ItalDesign, and a conspicuous susceptibility to rust.

==History==
===Background and development===
Alfa Romeo had explored building a smaller front wheel drive car in the 1950s but it was not until 1967 that firm plans were laid down for an all-new model to fit in below the existing Alfa Romeo range. 

The car was manufactured at a new factory at Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco in southern Italy, hence the car&#x27;s name, &quot;Alfa Sud&quot; (Alfa South). January 18, 1968, saw the registration at Naples of a new company named &quot;Industria Napoletana Costruzioni Autoveicoli Alfa Romeo-Alfasud S.p.A.&quot;. 90% of the share capital was subscribed by Alfa Romeo and 10% by Finmeccanica, at that time the financial arm of the government controlled IRI. Construction work on the company&#x27;s new state-sponsored plant at nearby Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco began in April 1968, on the site of an aircraft engine factory used by Alfa Romeo during World War II.

===Launch===
 The Alfasud debuted at the Turin Motor Show in 1971, featuring front wheel drive with a Boxer of 1,186 cc water-cooled engine with a belt-driven overhead camshaft on each cylinder head; front (MacPherson struts and rear beam axle with Watt&#x27;s linkage; inboard front disc brakes as well as rear disc brakes as well as rack and pinion steering. The boxer engine allowed a low hood/bonnet line, contributing to an aerodynamic profile, a low center of gravity, and noteworthy road-holding and handling. Despite its two-box shape, the Alfasud was not initially offered as a hatchback. Lights, turn indicators, horn, wipers and heater fan were operated by two column stalks.
===The range grows===
In November 1973 the first Alfasud sport model joined the range, the two-door Alfasud ti—(&quot;Turismo Internazionale&quot;, or Touring International). Along with a 5-speed gearbox, it featured a more powerful version of the 1.2 litre engine, brought to by adopting a Weber twin-choke carburettor, allowing the small saloon to reach . Quad round halogen headlamps, special wheels, a front body-colour spoiler beneath the bumper and rear black one around the tail distinguished the &quot;ti&quot;, while inside there was a three-spoke steering wheel, auxiliary gauges, leatherette/cloth seats, and carpets in place of rubber mats.


In 1974, Alfa Romeo launched a more upscale model, the Alfasud SE. The SE was replaced by the Alfasud L (&quot;Lusso&quot;) model introduced at the Bruxelles Motor Show in January 1975. Recognizable by its bumper overriders and chrome strips on the door sills and on the tail, the Lusso was better appointed than the standard Alfasud (which was now called &quot;normale&quot;), with such features as cloth upholstery, headrests, padded dashboard with glove compartment and optional tachometer. A three-door estate model called the Alfasud Giardinetta was introduced in May 1975, with the same equipment of the Alfasud &quot;L&quot;.

The Lusso model was produced until 1976, and was then replaced by the new Alfasud 5m (&quot;5 marce&quot;, five speed) model, the first four-door Alfasud with a five-speed gearbox. Presented at the March 1976 Geneva Motor Show, it was equipped like the Lusso it replaced.
In September 1976, the Alfasud Sprint coupé was launched. Built on the same platform of the saloon, it featured lower, more angular bodywork, again by Giorgetto Giugiaro, and featured a hatchback. The Sprint was powered by a new, more powerful Boxer, stroked from the 1.2 to displace and develop , and was paired the five-speed gearbox. The same 1286 cc engine was later fitted into the 2-door saloon, creating the Alfasud ti 1.3, which was put on sale alongside the &quot;ti&quot; 1.2 in July 1977.

===1978 revisions===
In late 1977 the Alfasud Super replaced the range-topping four-door &quot;5m&quot;. It was available with both the 1.2- and 1.3-litre engines from the &quot;ti&quot;, though both were equipped with a single-choke carburettor. The Super introduced improvements both outside, with new bumpers including large plastic strips, and inside, with a revised dashboard, new door cards and the choice of either Alfatex (vinyl) or two-tone cloth seats. Similar upgrades were applied to the Giardinetta.

In May 1978 the Sprint and &quot;ti&quot; got new engines, a 1.3 (1,350 cc) and an 1.5 (1,490 cc), both with a twin-choke carburettor. At the same time the Alfasud ti received cosmetic updates: bumpers from the Super, new rear spoiler on the boot lid, black wheel arch extensions and black front spoiler, and was upgraded to the revised interior of the Super. The 1.3 and 1.5 engines were soon made available alongside the 1.2 on the Giardinetta and Super, with a slightly lower output compared to the sport models, due to having a single-choke carburettor. In 1979 the Sprint was given a double twin-choke carburettor setup and became the Alfasud Sprint Veloce.

===1980 facelift===
All Alfasuds were upgraded in 1980 with plastic bumpers, a new instrument panel, headlamps and rear lights, as well as other revisions. The Ti version was fitted with a twin-carburetor version of the 1490 cc engine that had been fitted to the Sprint the previous year, developing A three-door hatchback was added to the range in 1981 in either SC or Ti trim, and the two-door Ti and Giardinetta were deleted from most markets around that time. Belatedly, in 1982 the four-door cars were replaced by five-door versions, as by now, most of its competitors were producing a hatchback of that size, although some also produced a saloon alternative. The range was topped by the five-door Gold Cloverleaf, featuring the engine from the Ti and enhanced interior trim.

In 1983 an attempt to keep pace with the hot hatchback market, the final version of the Alfasud Ti received a tuned 1490 cc engine developing . Named &quot;Quadrifoglio Verde&quot; (Green Cloverleaf), the model was also fitted with Michelin low-profile TRX tyres on metric rims (tyre size 190/55 VR 340 TRX) as well as an enhanced level of equipment.

===Rust===

The Alfasud became notorious for its propensity to rust, notably because of an assembly process that combined inferior recycled steel, and the factory&#x27;s Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco location just 15 kilometers from the Bay of Naples. In one instance, early bodies in white, ready for painting, were left in the naturally salty air outside of the assembly building. To inhibit rust, engineers called for filling all bodywork box-sections with synthetic foam, which was later discovered to hold moisture.

===End of production===
In 1983, the five-door Alfasud saloons were replaced by the 33 models. The 33 was an evolution of the Alfasud&#x27;s floorpan and running gear, including minor suspension alterations, and a change from four-wheel disc brakes to front discs and rear drum brakes to reduce costs. The Alfasud Sprint was renamed the Alfa Romeo Sprint in 1983. That model was continued until 1989 by sharing 33&#x27;s running gear. The three-door versions continued for a further year before being replaced by the unsuccessful Alfa Romeo Arna, a joint venture between Alfa Romeo and Nissan.

===Foreign assembly===
The Alfasud was also assembled in Malaysia by City Motors of Ipoh, although the plant was located in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian cars received the 1.2, 1.35, and 1.5 litre engines, and all had the four-door bodywork. In South Africa, Alfa Romeo&#x27;s local subsidiary built the Alfasud in its plant in Brits. Beginning in June 1981, the South African-made Alfasud was renamed the Alfa Romeo Export GTA and received the version of the 1.5 litre flat-four. The Export GTA had the five-door bodywork.

==Motorsport==
From 1975, a racing series was organised exclusively for Alfasuds. One year later, the Alfasud Trophy began in Italy and Austria, and later France and Germany got their own competitions. In 1977 the &quot;Trofeo Europa Alfasud&quot; was set up, in which the best drivers from each country competed. The Trofeo Alfasud was equipped with the 1,286 cc engine with an Autodelta kit. Gerhard Berger is probably the best-known driver to participate in the Alfasud Trofeo.

An Alfasud Ti contested the 1980 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 at Bathurst in Australia, placing fourth in the up to 1600 cc class. Jon Dooley, Rob Kirby and Andrew Thorpe took part in the 1982 British Saloon Car Championship season, using an Alfasud Ti and an Alfasud Sprint.

The Alfasud Ti also competed successfully in Rallying, with class wins in the prestigious Monte Carlo Rally in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984 and 1985. 

Legendary 3 time Formula 1 World Champion Ayrton Senna, had an Alfasud Ti 1.5L. He drove it to his first F1 test with Williams Racing.

==Concept cars==
===Alfa Romeo Caimano===
The Alfa Romeo Caimano is a concept car designed in 1971 by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Italdesign Giugiaro. It uses the same mechanicals and frame from the Alfasud, but with an shorter wheelbase.

==Famous conversions==
* Gian Franco Mantovani Wainer produced a one-off Bimotore version, with two 1,186 cc engines and four-wheel drive for rallying. Wainer also produced a turbocharged Turbowainer model in 1983.
* The Alfasud was the basis of the Minari kit car designed by Andy Borrowman and Sean Prendergast. Approximately 120 cars were sold throughout the 1990s.

<text>The Granby Prédateurs (&quot;Predators&quot;) were a Canadian junior ice hockey team founded in 1981 after the team moved from Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, where they had been known as the Sorel Éperviers. The team had been known as the Granby Bisons, but changed their name to the Prédateurs in 1995. They played at Arena Leonard Grondin in Granby, Quebec, Canada.

However, the combination of a small, aging arena and low attendance forced the team to move soon after. In 1997 the Prédateurs moved to Sydney, Nova Scotia, where they became the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles.

==NHL alumni==
National Hockey League alumni from the Prédateurs two seasons include Philippe Audet, Francis Bouillon, Xavier Delisle, Jason Doig, Daniel Goneau, Benoit Gratton and Georges Laraque. Michel Therrien, who had coached the team to the Memorial Cup, later coached the Montreal Canadiens.

<doc id="1255156" wikidata="Q889240" url="?curid=1255156" title="Happy Xmas (War Is Over)">
<text>&quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; is a Christmas song released in 1971 as a single by John &amp; Yoko/The Plastic Ono Band with the Harlem Community Choir. It was the seventh single released by John Lennon outside his work with the Beatles. The song reached number four in the UK, where its release was delayed until November 1972, and has occasionally re-emerged on the UK Singles Chart, most notably after Lennon&#x27;s murder in December 1980, when it peaked at number two.

Also a protest song against the Vietnam War, &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; has since become a Christmas standard, frequently recorded by other artists, appearing on compilation albums of seasonal music, and named in polls as a holiday favourite. In a UK-wide poll in December 2012, it was voted tenth on the ITV television special &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Christmas Song&quot;.

== Background ==

&quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; was the culmination of more than two years of peace activism undertaken by John Lennon and Yoko Ono that began with the bed-ins they convened in March and May 1969, the first of which took place during their honeymoon. The song&#x27;s direct antecedent was an international multimedia campaign launched by the couple in December 1969 – at the height of the counterculture movement and its protests against America&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War – that primarily consisted of renting billboard space in 12 major cities around the world for the display of black-and-white posters that declared &quot;WAR IS OVER! If You Want It – Happy Christmas from John &amp; Yoko&quot;. Although a similar line had previously appeared in the 1968 anti-war songs &quot;The War Is Over&quot; by Phil Ochs and &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; by the Doors (which features the refrain &quot;The war is over&quot;), the use of &quot;War is over&quot; (minus the definite article) by Lennon and Ono may be coincidental; there is no evidence to confirm that they were acquainted with these earlier works, or if so whether they were influenced by them.

Recognising the accessibility and popular appeal that made his 1971 single &quot;Imagine&quot; more commercially successful than his other post-Beatles songs, Lennon concluded, &quot;Now I understand what you have to do: Put your political message across with a little honey.&quot; He conceived &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; as a means of elaborating upon the themes of social unity and peaceful change enacted through personal accountability and empowerment that served as the basis of the earlier billboard campaign, trying to convey optimism while avoiding the sentimentality that he felt often characterised Christmas songs. 
From 1963 to 1969, the Beatles had issued special recordings at Christmas directly to members of their fan club. After the group disbanded in 1970, Lennon was the first former member to release an original Christmas song. &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; would be followed by George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Ding Dong, Ding Dong&quot; (1974), Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful Christmastime&quot; (1979) and Ringo Starr&#x27;s album &quot;I Wanna Be Santa Claus&quot; (1999).
== Recording ==
In late October 1971, with not much more than bare-bones melody and half-formed lyrics, Lennon recorded an acoustic guitar demo of &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; in his rooms at the St. Regis Hotel in New York City, where he and Ono were living. Ono would receive co-writing credit, but the actual extent of her contribution at this initial stage is unclear since she did not participate in the demo, which was atypical of their collaborations. Another demo of the song was made in late October after the couple had taken an apartment in Greenwich Village. Lennon brought in Phil Spector to help produce, as he had with his previous two albums, &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; and &quot;Imagine,&quot; which had been released in the US several weeks earlier.

The first recording session was held on the evening of Thursday, 28 October, at the Record Plant studio. After the session musicians – some of whom had performed at one time or another as members of the Plastic Ono Band – laid down the basic instrumental backing and overdub tracks, Lennon and Ono added the main vocals. One of the four guitarists present filled in for bassist Klaus Voormann, whose flight from Germany had been delayed. The following day, Ono and the session musicians, including Voormann, recorded the single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;Listen, the Snow Is Falling&quot;. The Harlem Community Choir – 30 children, most of them four to twelve years of age – came to the studio on the afternoon of 31 October to record backing vocals for the counter-melody and sing-along chorus. Photographs for the original sleeve cover were also taken during that session by Iain Macmillan.

== Composition ==
The song begins with spoken Christmas greetings from Ono and Lennon to their children from previous marriages: Ono whispers, &quot;Happy Christmas, Kyoko&quot;, then Lennon whispers, &quot;Happy Christmas, Julian&quot;.&quot;

When Lennon first played his demo for Phil Spector, the producer remarked that the song&#x27;s opening line, &quot;So this is Christmas…&quot;, was rhythmically identical to the 1961 single &quot;I Love How You Love Me&quot; by The Paris Sisters, which Spector himself had produced. At the recording studio, Lennon instructed the guitarists to incorporate mandolin-style riffs similar to the ones heard in &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot;, a single that Spector and George Harrison had produced in February 1971 for his wife, Ronnie Spector, formerly of the Ronettes. Spector also included percussion instruments of the sort he used on the 1963 album &quot;A Christmas Gift for You&quot;.

In addition to these reappropriated elements, the chords and melodic structure of &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; are similar to the traditional English ballad &quot;Skewball&quot;, but with a different rhythmic meter, subsequent modulations and a wholly new and different chorus countermelody. The verses of the song are closest in structure to the 1963 rendition (titled &quot;Stewball&quot;) by Peter, Paul and Mary.

== Release ==
Apple Records released &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; and &quot;Listen, the Snow Is Falling&quot; in America on 1 December 1971 (Apple 1842). Issued in 7&quot; single format on transparent green vinyl with a card-stock picture sleeve, the pressing bore two label variations, one of which displayed a sequence of five images that showed Lennon&#x27;s face transforming into Ono&#x27;s. This sequence was originally featured on the reverse cover of the exhibition catalogue for Ono&#x27;s career retrospective &quot;This Is Not Here&quot;, presented in October 1971 at the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, New York.

A dispute between music publisher Northern Songs and Lennon over publishing rights delayed the release of &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; in the UK until 24 November 1972 (Apple R 5870). The initial British run was issued in 7&quot; single format on opaque green vinyl with the picture sleeve and variant label, but it sold out quickly and had to be repressed on standard black vinyl.

The song&#x27;s first album appearance was on &quot;Shaved Fish&quot;, the only compilation of Lennon&#x27;s solo recordings released during his lifetime. &quot;Happy Xmas&quot; was coupled there with part of a live version of &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;, performed as the finale of Lennon and Ono&#x27;s &quot;One to One&quot; benefit concert on 30 August 1972. Designed by Roy Kohara, the album cover is composed of illustrations by Michael Bryan representing each song on the album; for &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot;, the image shows an aeroplane dropping a Christmas ornament instead of a bomb.

Over the years, &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; has been reissued in a number of single formats by Capitol, Geffen and Parlophone, sometimes in conjunction with the release of albums collecting Lennon&#x27;s work. It has also appeared on compilations of Christmas songs, notably those from the &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music!&quot; series.

A rough mix produced during the first recording session on 28 October 1971 was released in 1998 on the &quot;John Lennon Anthology&quot;.

===Music videos===
A music video for &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; appeared on &quot;The John Lennon Video Collection&quot;, released on VHS in 1992, corresponding to the 1989 reissue of &quot;The John Lennon Collection&quot;. It consisted of images from Lennon and Ono&#x27;s 1969 &quot;War is Over!&quot; billboard campaign and candid photographs of the couple and their son Sean from the late 1970s, interspersed with a boys&#x27; choral ensemble singing along with the original Harlem Community Choir vocals.

In 2003, a new video was created for the remastered 5.1 version of the song for the DVD &quot;Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon&quot;. This version has over 22 million views on YouTube.

==Reception==
On its US single debut in 1971, &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; did not meet with much success. This was due to the single&#x27;s late release, which resulted in limited airplay before Christmas, and a lack of promotion. The single peaked at number 36 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100 Singles and number 28 on the &quot;Record World&quot; Singles Chart, and number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Christmas Singles chart. The single subsequently re-appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Christmas charts in 1972, 1983, 1984, and 1985. The song appeared at number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult Contemporary chart for the week ending 6 January 1996. The song&#x27;s most recent chart entry, and highest position, on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; chart was in 2022, where it peaked at #38 for the week ending 31 December 2022.

&quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; enjoyed immediate success in Britain when issued there in November 1972. The song peaked at number 4 on the UK Singles Chart and number 10 on the listings compiled by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Since then, it has re-entered the UK Singles Chart nine more times. The most notable of these instances occurred immediately following Lennon&#x27;s death on 8 December 1980. The single peaked at number 2 – behind another reissued Lennon single, &quot;Imagine&quot; – and remained on the chart for nine weeks.

Between December 1972 and February 1973, the song entered the top ten in Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Singapore.

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Nick DeRiso rated it as Lennon&#x27;s 5th greatest solo political song, noting that &quot;Lennon took the opportunity to encourage Yuletide revelers toward a broader sense of pacifism.&quot;

== Other versions ==
In 1985, Australian group the Incredible Penguins released a version of the song, which peaked at number 10 on the Australian singles chart in December 1985.

In later decades, &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; has gained a higher profile in the cultural mainstream due to an increasing proliferation of recordings by other musical artists, most having been recorded since 2000. Among these, two have entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, both of them in the same year. The first was released on 17 October 2006 by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan along with her album &quot;Wintersong&quot;, which was the best-selling Christmas album of the year and a Grammy nominee. It features backing vocals from the Children&#x27;s and Youth Choirs of the Music Outreach Program at the Sarah McLachlan School of Music in Vancouver, British Columbia. Entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart at number 22 on the week ending 9 December 2006, it climbed to a peak position of number 5, four weeks later. The second was released on 12 December 2006 by American rock band The Fray as a digital download. It debuted at number 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 41 on the Pop 100 in the week ending 31 December 2006, but stayed on the respective charts for only one more week.

Some of the earliest of the other versions of &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; appear on holiday albums released by major pop singers, such as &quot;I Still Believe in Santa Claus&quot; (1990) by Andy Williams, &quot;The Christmas Album&quot; (1992) by Neil Diamond, &quot;A Very Special Season&quot; (1994) by Diana Ross, and &quot;These Are Special Times&quot; (1998) by Celine Dion.

Other notable recordings of &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; include a 1991 version on the album &quot;Standards&quot; by The Alarm, a 1994 in-concert performance by Melissa Etheridge, a 1995 Brazilian version by Simone, the 2002 version by South African band Toxic Shame, the 2002 &quot;Maybe This Christmas&quot; version from Sense Field. American pop rock band Maroon 5 released a cover in 2005, in support of Amnesty International&#x27;s Make Some Noise campaign. Australian singer Delta Goodrem recorded this song as a b-side on her 5th single Predictable. A 2009 version by mash-up band Beatallica on the album &quot;Winter Plunderband&quot;. On 13 December 2012, Sean Lennon performed the song with gospel singer Mavis Staples, Jeff Tweedy of the band Wilco, and the Harlem Gospel Choir on the Comedy Central program &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. This version was made available for purchase on the music download site iTunes, and proceeds were donated to Hurricane Sandy disaster relief. During John Lennon&#x27;s 75th Birthday Concert, Sheryl Crow, Aloe Blacc, and Peter Frampton performed the song with a children&#x27;s chorus from The Stuttering Association for the Youth.

On 14 December 2018, Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson recorded a version of the song featuring Lennon&#x27;s son, Sean Ono Lennon. The three of them performed their cover on 15 December 2018 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where Ronson and Cyrus were booked as the episode&#x27;s musical guests. In November 2019, John Legend released a new version of the song, including string arrangements by Matt Jones which featured an improvised solo by violinist Scott Tixier. It reached number nine in the UK Singles Chart. The song was also covered in late 2019 by HimeHina VTubers Hime Tanaka and Hina Suzuki.

A French version was recorded by René Simard and his little sister Nathalie entitled &quot;Noël Des Enfants&quot; from René&#x27;s album &quot;18 ans déjà&quot;.

<doc id="1255173" wikidata="Q399006" url="?curid=1255173" title="David Tsubouchi">
<text>(born August 20, 1951) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. He was the first Japanese Canadian elected to a provincial legislature.

==Background==
Tsubouchi was born in Toronto, and grew up in Scarborough in the Agincourt area. His parents were Japanese Canadians, originally from British Columbia, who were interned during World War II. After their release they moved to Toronto. He graduated from Agincourt Collegiate Institute in 1968 and attended York University where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1972, and a law degree from Osgoode Hall in 1975. He was the senior partner in the firm of &quot;Tsubouchi &amp; Nichols&quot; (formerly &quot;Tsubouchi &amp; Parker&quot;) following his graduation. Tsubouchi was also an Associate Director of the Japanese Canadian Cultural Centre, and was a frequent contributor to the &quot;Law Gazette&quot;. He received an Air Canada Heart of Gold award in 1988, and was granted a coat-of-arms from the Canadian Governor-General&#x27;s office in 1993. Tsubouchi has a younger brother and sister. His father was killed in a hit and run accident in 2005.

Tsubouchi worked briefly as an actor. He had a minor role as a Japanese salesman in David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;Videodrome&quot; in 1983, and episodes of John Byner&#x27;s &quot;Bizarre&quot; and &quot;SCTV&quot;.

==Politics==

===Municipal councillor===
Tsubouchi was elected as a city councillor in ward 5 in Markham and served from 1988 to 1994.

===Provincial politics===
In the provincial election of 1995, he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the provincial riding of Markham, defeating his nearest opponent by 26,544 votes. The Tories won a majority government in the election and Tsubouchi was appointed as Minister of Community and Social Services in the government of Mike Harris on June 26, 1995.

In this portfolio, Tsubouchi was responsible for presiding over drastic cuts in the province&#x27;s welfare system. He also made a number of controversial actions early in his ministry, including suggesting that welfare recipients who had their funding reduced should consider haggling down the price of dented cans of tuna to 69 cents each. He also claimed that single mothers on welfare had ample time to find jobs, after having given a three-month warning for a 22% cut in benefits.

Later, he prepared a sample menu which listed affordable food purchases for those whose welfare rates had been reduced. His list was found to have less nutritional value than the diet served to prisoners in Ontario jails. There were several calls for his resignation in the wake of these comments; even the right-leaning &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; newspaper suggested that he should be removed. He remained with the portfolio until August 16, 1996, when he was named Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations.

Notwithstanding his handling of the Social Services portfolio, Tsubouchi was regarded in some circles as one of the more progressively-minded ministers in the Harris government. He supported the centre-right Progressive Conservative Party of Canada rather than the right-wing Reform Party at the federal level, and in 2000 was the only member of the Progressive Conservative caucus to openly support Joe Clark for the federal party&#x27;s leadership. He was also credited by some for at least making an effort to cushion the blow of his government&#x27;s welfare cuts. Nonetheless, the legacy of his department&#x27;s cutbacks would follow Tsubouchi for the rest of his career, and make him a frequent target of social activists opposed to the Harris government.

Tsubouchi&#x27;s tenure as Consumer and Commercial Relations Minister was comparatively uneventful. He was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal Steven Kirsch by just over 13,000 votes.

On June 17, 1999, he was appointed as the province&#x27;s Solicitor-General. He held this position until a cabinet shuffle on February 8, 2001, when he was named Chair of the Management Board of Cabinet.

Tsubouchi supported Ernie Eves&#x27;s successful bid to replace Mike Harris as party leader in 2002. Eves retained him as chair of the Management Board, and also named him as Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Culture on April 15, 2002.

In the provincial election of 2003, Tsubouchi was upset by Liberal candidate Tony Wong, losing by about 6,000 votes. In 2004, he supported John Tory&#x27;s successful bid to replace Eves as party leader.

===Cabinet positions===



==After politics==
He worked as associate counsel at the law firm Miller Thomson LLP, and is currently the founder and chairman of Deduce International Markets Inc In 2007 he was invested as a Knight in The Equestrian, Secular and Chapterial Order of Saint Joachim in Toronto.

In recent years, Tsubouchi has worked as a partner at the law firm Fogler, Rubinoff LLP, and has been appointed to head Ontario College of Trades starting on September 9, 2013. In 2013 he published &quot;Gambatte&quot;, a memoir of his career.

<text>South Melbourne Football Club is an Australian semi-professional soccer club based in suburb of Albert Park, in Melbourne, Victoria. The club currently competes in the National Premier Leagues Victoria, with matches played at Lakeside Stadium.

The club was founded in 1959 by Greek migrants following World War II as South Melbourne Hellas (), with a basis in the Greek community.

The club has won four Australian national championships, a string of Victorian State League titles, numerous Dockerty Cups and represented Oceania in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship. Along with the Marconi Stallions, they were one of two clubs to compete in every season of the National Soccer League.

The club was chosen by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics as the Oceania Club of the Century for the 20th century.

==History==
===Formation===
South Melbourne was formed in 1959 with the amalgamation of three struggling Melbourne soccer clubs—South Melbourne United, the oldest of the three clubs with a history dating back to the early 1900s—the Greek-backed Yarra Park Aias (Ajax), and Hellenic. Theo Marmaras, initiator of the merger proposal and president of Hellenic, became the first president of the new club. In recognition of the large Greek Australian support base of Hellenic and Yarra Park, which were also the best-supported of the three clubs, the new club was named South Melbourne Hellas, the name by which it was to be known for the majority of its 50 years. The first emblem reflected the colour scheme of the Greek national flag. The first uniform consisted of jersey of white with a red &#x27;V&#x27; around the collar, the was also that of South Melbourne United, as well as blue shorts and blue and white hooped socks. Later on they would adopt predominantly blue and white strips, with various designs throughout the seasons, with the most common being a predominantly royal blue strip.

===1960–1969===

South Melbourne won the Victorian First Division (North) championship of 1960, the club&#x27;s inaugural year of competition. The club was promoted to the Victorian State League First Division the following year, where it finished fifth in its first year. With a number of astute signings—Scottish journeyman Tommy Anderson (George Cross), Ernie Ackerley (Manchester United), Leo Damianakos (Kalamata), Jim Pyrgolios (Panathinaikos) and Andreas Roussis, formerly of Panathinaikos and Apollon Athens—the club won the division championship in 1962, 1964, and 1965. In 1965, South Melbourne secured the services of 35-year-old former AEK Athens star, Kostas Nestoridis as player-coach. The result was a significant increase in crowd attendances and a fourth league title in 1966. Eager to repeat its success, the club recruited a number of Greek and local footballers, but they failed to make any impact. By 1969, the import experiment was considered a failure and most of the Greek players returned to their homeland.

===1970–77===
In 1970, the club focused its attention on recruiting local soccer players. It soon signed two players that would become South Melbourne Men&#x27;s greatest players, Steve Walker and striker Jim Armstrong. South Melbourne missed out on the title by a point in the 1971 season, edged out by Footscray JUST, but with Armstrong scoring goals aplenty, South Melbourne went on to win the championship in 1972. The season also saw coach Bill Curran consolidate the first team&#x27;s strength by signing midfielder Peter Bourne (Burnley) and promoting highly skilled youngsters Giovanni Barticciotto, Fethon Ileris and Bill Hasapis. The club continued its successful run with the 1974 title, second place in 1975, and with star recruits Jimmy Mackay, Peter Ollerton and Duncan Cummings, capped off its final year in the Victorian State League by winning the 1976 championship.

===National Soccer League===
South Melbourne joined Mooroolbark, Heidelberg United and Footscray JUST, as Melbourne&#x27;s participants in the newly formed National Soccer League (NSL) in 1977, which was Australia&#x27;s first sporting national competition. A mass exodus of its best players (Armstrong, Bourne, Mackay, Walker), saw the team slump to eleventh place in its inaugural year, but a recruiting drive by coach Dave Maclaren gave the club a respectable third in 1978. It was not to last as South Melbourne finished at the bottom of the league table in 1979.

===1978–89===

The recruitment of Alan Davidson, George Campbell (Aberdeen), Steve Blair, Branko Buljevic, Alun Evans (Liverpool), and Charlie Egan, helped South Melbourne climb the NSL ladder in the early part of the decade, with South becoming runners up in the NSL in 1981, which was their best ever NSL placing at the time. They also won the Ampol Cup in 1982. Some solid player signings such as (Oscar Crino, Doug Brown, Bobby Russell and John Yzendoorn) gave the club some respectability, but a combination of committee problems and a string of coaches, never allowed the team to settle and gain consistency. South 
Melbourne finished first on the league ladder in 1984, but in a newly restructured NSL competition, it also had to win the finals series to win the title. The club powered past local rivals Heidelberg United in the Southern Division play-offs, and edged out Sydney Olympic in the Grand Final to win the 1984 national championship.

After the departure of George Campbell to rivals Preston Makedonia in 1983/84, Branko Buljevic to Footscray Just in 1985 and others, South Melbourne could not repeat the success of the previous year. Despite finishing in first place, it was knocked out of the finals series by local rivals Brunswick Juventus and Preston. A major overhaul by coach Brian Garvey saw a number of new signings being made, including youngsters Paul Trimboli, David Healy, Kimon Taliadoros and Harry Micheil. The young team put in some memorable performances as the decade came to a close, finishing in the top half of the league table, but failed to win another championship. The club appointed Footballing icon Ferenc Puskás as coach for the 1989/90 season, helping South win the NSL Cup tournament for that season, as well backing up their 1988 Dockerty Cup win with victory in the 1989 tournament.

On 28 November 1981, South Melbourne Hellas and Melbourne Hakoah announced that they had merged to form a second team for South Melbourne which would compete in the Victorian State League and act as a feeder club to the South Melbourne senior team.

The price paid for 54 years of Hakoah history was $35,000. The merger had been an ongoing discussion between the two co-tenants of Middle Park from the middle of the 1981 season.

The two clubs had shared Middle Park from 1961 until 1981. Melbourne Hakoah cited financial strains and lack of crowd support as the two prime reasons why the club was forced to accept the offer from South Melbourne.

===1990–95===
The club&#x27;s change of fortune continued next season, with the club winning its second national championship, beating rivals Melbourne Croatia on penalties after a tense 1–1 score line in normal time with many describing it as one of Australian footballs best matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;ozfootball-90/91playoffs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With Croatia dominating most of the proceedings, striker Joe Palatsides was put through on goal by Paul Trimboli who equalised with the last kick of the game.

The team boasted some of the finest Australian football talent in Paul Fernandes, Michael Petersen, Paul Wade, Mehmet Durakovic, Paul Trimboli and Con Boutsianis. The feat could not be repeated the next year as the club was eliminated by eventual premiers Adelaide City in a Preliminary Final.&lt;ref name=&quot;ozfootball-91/92playoffs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Former player Jim Pyrgolios replaced Puskás for the 1992/93 season which saw the club finish first on the points table during the regular season. South Melbourne was again eliminated during the finals series by Adelaide City and Marconi-Fairfield, the latter inflicting a 7–0 thrashing. In 1993/94, the club finished second, but failed yet again to progress to the Grand Final, courtesy of Melbourne Croatia and their nemesis, Adelaide City. For the 1994/95 season, the club hired former Socceroos coach Frank Arok to replace Pyrgolios. The round one game from that season was the club&#x27;s last at its Middle Park home before moving temporarily to Olympic Park while they awaited the completion of their new home, the 14,000-capacity Lakeside Stadium, on the site of the former Lake Oval. The club finished sixth on the ladder, but was eliminated again in the Preliminary Final by the Melbourne Knights in a 3-2 thriller in the rain with a hattrick to Mark Viduka. Arok left the club after a disappointing 1995/96 season, which saw South miss the finals for the first time since 1989.

===Name and emblem change===

In 1996, the club was required by Soccer Australia, along with clubs all over the country, to change its emblem and name in an attempt to move soccer into the Australian mainstream and away from direct club-level association with its migrant roots. As a consequence, South Melbourne Hellas reappeared as South Melbourne Lakers. Its new name and emblem was not well received by many of its Greek supporters. The name change also drew attention from American NBA team, the L.A. Lakers, who threatened legal action.

Under new coach and former captain Ange Postecoglou, the club bounced back in season 1996/97, finishing third on the table and eventually being eliminated by Sydney United in the Preliminary Final. The club capped off the end of the decade with impressive performances, becoming Australian champions in 1998 and 1999, thanks to performances by Paul Trimboli, Vaughan Coveny, Con Blatsis and former PAOK star John Anastasiadis.

In the 1998 Grand Final, South Melbourne defeated league newcomer Carlton 2–1 with a controversial late chip by Boutsianis, sending the crowd into pandemonium. 
That win was followed up in 1999 with a come-from-behind 3–2 win against Sydney United in the Grand Final, which was the first time the club had gone back-to-back since the glory days of the 1960s. This win would be Hellas&#x27; fourth and final national championship. By now, South Melbourne had dropped the &quot;Lakers&quot; moniker and become South Melbourne Soccer Club, and sported a new emblem—the current blue and white shield with stars (each star representing a national championship). They followed up their fourth domestic title with the 1999 Oceania Club Championship, a win that qualified them for the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship in Brazil.

===2000–04 Taking on the World===
Grouped with Vasco Da Gama, Necaxa, and the treble-winning Manchester United in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship, South Melbourne lost all three games. Despite the losses and being the only non-professional club at the tournament, the club gained some respectability amongst its peers with its performance, as well as some much needed exposure on the world stage, something that had been severely lacking for Australian soccer clubs at the time.
On its return from Brazil, South Melbourne failed to make the finals in the 1999/2000 season, finishing well outside the top six finals spots. Before the new season started, Postecoglou left South Melbourne in order to take up the position of Australian youth coach, and was replaced by former South player and teammate Mike Petersen. At the end of the 2000/01 home and away season, South Melbourne had finished a comfortable eight points clear of Wollongong, but lost both legs of its major semi-final against the Wolves 2–1, meaning South Melbourne would have to win the preliminary final in order to earn a rematch. They duly did so, with a 2–0 victory over Sydney Olympic, but put in a lacklustre performance in the Grand Final, with a late revival not being enough once more losing 2–1.

Prior to the start of the 2001/2002 season, South Melbourne suffered a major blow as Petersen, along with several players including Boutsianis and Andy Vlahos left to join the Football Kingz. A young squad under the management of Eddie Krncevic struggled, occupying the bottom rungs of the table halfway through the season, before the return in controversial circumstances of Boutsianis sparked a major revival, which saw the club finish fifth in the standings, eventually being eliminated by eventual champions Olympic Sharks in the finals.

Krnčević was replaced by former player Danny Wright for the 2002/03 season, but the club failed to reach the finals by a point. Stuart Munro took over as coach for the 2003/04 season, with the club finishing fifth, eventually being eliminated by a penalty deep into extra time against Adelaide United in what turned out to be South&#x27;s final game in the NSL.

With the combined factors of the demise of the NSL, and poor financial management, South Melbourne fell into voluntary administration and lost most of its squad. With Melbourne being allocated just one licence for an A-League team, which was widely expected to go to a new franchise, and with the club in extreme financial difficulty, South Melbourne chose not to lodge an application to join the new competition.

===Return to Victorian competition===

Entering the Victorian Premier League in 2005 as South Melbourne Football Club, and with a new team under former player and new coach John Anastasiadis, the club reached the Preliminary Final of the VPL, going down to their old rivals Heidelberg United. The season was highlighted by fluctuating crowd attendances at home games, national media attention paid to crowd trouble with fans of Preston Lions, but also by good performances by a young and talented side, which before the season had been a relegation favourite.

In 2006, South Melbourne finished third in the table, courtesy of a strong home record, including a record 7–0 thrashing of old foe Melbourne Knights. They eventually progressed to the final, by defeating Green Gully and Altona Magic in successive weeks. In the final itself, once more against Altona Magic, a second half goal by Gianni De Nittis was enough to see South Melbourne win the game 1–0, and win their eighth Victorian championship, their first in 30 years, and first since returning to the competition in 2005.

In 2007, South Melbourne had a poor year, finishing in seventh place, missing the finals; after a poor start in 2008, Anastasiadis resigned. With another former player Michael Michalakopoulos taking charge, the team moved away from the relegation zone, but still missed the finals.

The club celebrated its 50th anniversary year during the 2009 season, with several heritage strips and a logo reminiscent of the pre-1990s logo used to mark the occasion. The club secured the services of Vaughan Coveny, recently retired from A-League football, who went on to score his 100th goal for the club, with Ramazan Tavsancioglu and Fernando de Moraes also marking personal milestones by playing their 100th games. Michalakopoulos departed, after the club bowed out early in the finals series, to be replaced as coach by Vaughan Coveny.

The 2010 season saw drastic changes to the club with the re-development of Bob Jane Stadium commencing several rounds in the season. This forced the club to relocate the remainder of its 2010 home fixtures, and all of its 2011 home matches, to John Cain Memorial Park in a sharing arrangement with Northcote City. The arrival of high-profile players including Carl Recchia, Peter Zois and Joe Keenan among others brought a renewed hope of on-field success to the supporters. Despite some good on-field performances and individual brilliance, with Fernando de Moraes winning the VPL Player of the Year and Peter Zois taking out the Goalkeeper of the Year award, the promised success did not eventuate with the club narrowly missing out on a finals berth.

Meanwhile, the club gained much international recognition with the award of being the Oceania Club of the Century by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics at a lavish gala ceremony at the Hurlingham Club in Fulham, London in May 2010 and entry into the 2010 Singapore Cup. South Melbourne miraculously won its first-round match against Gombak United 2–1, and returned to Singapore in October for a two-legged playoff against Bangkok Glass at the Jalan Besar Stadium, but were knocked out by the eventual champions 6–4 on aggregate. Coveny was replaced as coach after the end of the VPL season for the Singapore Cup tie by Eddie Krncevic, who returned to the club after a stint as coach in the 2001/2002 NSL season. The club travelled to Singapore again for the 2011 Singapore Cup, but were bundled out in the first round by Albirex Niigata.

Under Krncevic, the club rallied late in the 2011 VPL season to finish fourth, but had their season ended in a penalty shootout in the semi-final by Oakleigh Cannons. Krncevic was replaced in 2012 by former player Peter Tsolakis, who moved across from Northcote City with several players. 2012 saw the return of South Melbourne to their home ground, now known as Lakeside Stadium, with vastly improved amenities, a second grandstand and an international-standard athletics track, which was opened in December 2011 with a friendly against old foes Sydney Olympic. However, the club could not capitalise on its own turf, with terrible home form condemning the club to finish outside the top five, and miss out on finals once again.

In July 2013, Tsolakis resigned from his post after the board sacked five senior squad members without his consultation and the club appointed former Sunshine George Cross, Melbourne Knights and Dandenong Thunder manager Chris Taylor on a two-year deal. South Melbourne finished the season in fourth place.

===National Premier League era===
In 2014, the club entered the National Premier Leagues Victoria competition, which replaced the old Victorian Premier League. South had a fantastic season, taking out their first league title since their 2000–01 NSL title. In the NPL National Finals Series, South Melbourne beat South Hobart 1–0 at the South Hobart Ground, but lost to North Eastern MetroStars in the semi-final 2–1.

In 2015, the club retained the NPL Victoria premiership, but lost to rivals Bentleigh Greens in the Grand Final. South Melbourne also won the Dockerty Cup, but lost to Palm Beach in the 2015 FFA Cup Round of 32.

South Melbourne then recruited the likes of Matthew Foschini, Matt Millar and Marcus Schroen for the following season. South got season 2016 off on a bad note, losing the FFV Community Shield 3–0 to Bentleigh, but opened the NPL Victoria season on an emphatic note, beating traditional rivals Heidelberg United 6–0 in front of over 3,000 fans at Lakeside. On 30 March 2016, South Melbourne announced that it had secured a 40-year lease of Lakeside Stadium, with the club now &quot;able to commence building its new administrational offices, museum, futsal court and bistro / social room in its exclusive areas.&quot; South Melbourne bowed out of the 2016 FFA Cup qualifying rounds at the final qualifying round, losing 4–0 to rivals Bentleigh Greens. The club finished in third place in the league, but went on to win the Championship through the finals series, beating Hume City 3-0 and then Oakleigh Cannons 3–2 in the grand final. South Melbourne began construction on its exclusive areas at Lakeside Stadium in October 2016, with the development including the building of a new social club, futsal court and club offices.

In 2017, South Melbourne finished runners-up in the league behind traditional rivals Heidelberg United. In the finals series, Hellas lost to eventual champions Bentleigh Greens in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-final. After reaching the 2017 FFA Cup national stages, South Melbourne defeated Edgeworth, Sorrento and Gold Coast City to reach the semi-finals where they hosted Sydney at Lakeside Stadium, eventually going down 5–1 to the reigning A-League champions in front of almost 6,000 people.

On the eve of the 2018 season, manager Chris Taylor and the club parted ways after four and a half seasons. He was replaced by South Melbourne Men&#x27;s U-20 manager Saša Kolman.

In the off-season, the club announced that Con Tangalakis had been appointed as the senior head coach on a permanent basis, after guiding them to survival while on an interim basis the season prior. The club then farewelled three-time NPL Golden Boot and five-time club Golden Boot winner Milos Lujic after five years of service to the club. After a start to the season, which saw the club manage two wins, a draw and four losses, leaving South Melbourne in eleventh place, senior coach Con Tangalakis offered his resignation, and senior assistant coach Estaban Quintas was appointed in a caretaker role to see out the 2019 season.

===National Second League era===
South Melbourne announcement officially play in National Second Division from October 2025 after submitting in Australian Professional League and club founder from eight teams on 20 November 2023. They will continue to play in the NPL Victoria for the 2024 and 2025 season, before transitioning to the new league following season.

== Stadium ==
From its formation in 1959, Hellas played its home game at Middle Park Stadium. The ground with an 18,000 seat capacity was a fully enclosed venue by 1960, and a grandstand built by South Melbourne Hellas and Melbourne Hakoah, partly with funds lent to it by the Albert Park management authority was opened in the May 1961. The stadium saw many sellout crowds as South Melbourne made the jump to state league club to National league in 1977.

In 1993, the Victorian Government made a successful bid to bring the Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix to Melbourne with the agreement that the running track would be in Albert Park. South Melbourne were forced to move from their home ground due to the installation of the track. On October 23, 1994, the final match at Middle Park was played as South Melbourne hosted traditional rivals Heidelberg Alexander beating them 4–1 in front of a sold-out crowd.

South Melbourne moved to Lakeside Stadium in 1995. The stadium was built with a capacity of 14,000 people. A grandstand with an approximate capacity of 3,000 people was situated on one side, with a social club, reception centre and administrative facilities built in, while the other three sides of the ground consisted of open terraces with wooden seats. At one stage, a second two tiered stand for the outer side was proposed, but only preliminary plans were produced.

As well as being the home of South Melbourne, the venue also hosted games by the Socceroos, Young Socceroos, Australia&#x27;s national women&#x27;s team the Matildas, and grand finals and finals matches of the Victorian Premier League (now National Premier Leagues Victoria). It has also been a training base for the Greece national football team, France national football team and the Brazilian football national team.

In May 2008, the state government announced that Lakeside Stadium would undergo a major redevelopment, in order to accommodate an athletics track, as part of moving Athletics Victoria from Olympic Park. The Victorian Institute of Sport, Athletics Victoria and South Melbourne FC would share tenancy of the venue. Major Projects Victoria committed $60 million to the project. South Melbourne played its final match under the old Lakeside Stadium&#x27;s in April 2010, and construction work on the remodelled venue began in June 2010. Under the remodelling, the old grandstand stand was refurbished to house the VIS and included a state of the art gym, swimming pool and clubrooms. A blue running track in reference to the home colour of the club was also constructed for the Athletics division.

Today, Lakeside Stadium is one of Australia&#x27;s premiere stadiums.

== Rivals ==
Being one of the top placed sides since their inception, South Melbourne have numerous rivalries stemming from their participation in the State Leagues, National Soccer League and VPL/NPL.
*Melbourne Knights
* Heidelberg United
* Preston Lions
*
* Sydney Olympic

== Supporters ==
South Melbourne have traditionally been one of the most well supported Football clubs in Australia, with fans across many countries and states. Their supporters have been noted for their vocal support and their dedication shown through banners and flags.

Currently, the main supporter faction is known as the Clarendon Corner, which has been present since the last few years of the NSL and place themselves in the corner of the stadium. Prior to that, the &#x27;Hellas fans&#x27; would traditionally place themselves behind the goal South Melbourne was shooting at in large numbers.

==A-League aspirations==
Since dropping out of the national competition at the demise of the NSL, the club has held aspirations to return to the top competition for football clubs in Australia. On 14 February 2007, South Melbourne announced their interest in becoming the second Victorian club in the A-League. In June 2008, South Melbourne sent a letter of interest to join the league and lodged an application for the second Melbourne licence as part of the Southern Cross consortium, but on 26 September 2008 the Football Federation Australia announced it was commencing exclusive negotiations with the rival Melbourne Heart bid, which went on to join the competition for the 2010-11 A-League season.

In March 2013, it was revealed that the club was in negotiations to take a stake in the cash-strapped Central Coast Mariners, but talks cooled off when the Mariners ownership structure was consolidated under Mike Charlesworth. In April 2013, the club was revealed to have made several offers to take a 100 per cent stake in Melbourne Heart; however, these offers were rejected. Melbourne Heart management subsequently accepted an offer from Manchester City.

In November 2016, it was reported that South Melbourne intended to submit a bid for an A-League licence, with the club intending to continue playing home games at Lakeside Stadium, if the bid is successful. Following this news, the club provisionally appointed Brazil and Real Madrid legend Roberto Carlos as the team&#x27;s head coach should they be granted an expansion slot.

South Melbourne submitted a bid to join the expanded A-League in September 2018; however, were unsuccessful once again when, in December 2018, new consortium Western Melbourne was selected instead.

==Current squad==









==Competition timeline==
South Melbourne won eight premierships, two Dockerty Cups, and two Ampol Cups before their entrance into the National Soccer League (NSL) in 1977. In the 1984 season, they won their first NSL premiership and their first championship, defeating Sydney Olympic 4–2 over a 2-legged Grand Final. They won another four premierships and three championships, only in the 1997–98 season winning the double again, before the NSL folded in 2004. The club didn&#x27;t enter the newly formed national competition, the A-League, due to the bidding process and one team for one state rule, and returned to playing at state level, entering the Victorian Premier League. Since then, they have won two premierships and two championships, with the most recent being in 2016.

<text>The Royal British Columbia Museum (or Royal BC Museum), founded in 1886, is a history museum in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The &quot;Royal&quot; title was approved by Queen Elizabeth II and bestowed by Prince Philip in 1987, to coincide with a royal tour of that year. The museum merged with the British Columbia Provincial Archives in 2003.

The Royal BC Museum includes three permanent galleries: Natural History, Becoming BC, and the First Peoples Gallery. The museum&#x27;s collections comprise approximately 7 million objects, including natural history specimens, artifacts, and archival records. The natural history collections have 750,000 records of specimens almost exclusively from BC and neighbouring states, provinces, or territories. The collections are divided into eight disciplines: Entomology, Botany, Palaeontology, Ichthyology, Invertebrate Zoology, Herpetology, Mammalogy, and Ornithology. The museum also hosts touring exhibitions. Previous exhibitions have included artifacts related to the RMS Titanic, Leonardo da Vinci, Egyptian artifacts, the Vikings, the British Columbia gold rushes and Genghis Khan. The Royal BC Museum partners with and houses the IMAX Victoria theater, which shows educational films as well as commercial entertainment.

The museum is beside Victoria&#x27;s Inner Harbour, between the Empress Hotel and the Legislature Buildings. The museum anchors the Royal BC Museum Cultural Precinct, a surrounding area with historical sites and monuments, including Thunderbird Park. The museum also operates traveling exhibitions which tour the province of BC, as well as international exhibits Guangzhou, China.

On March 26, 2012, Jack Lohman was appointed CEO of the Royal BC Museum. Various groups assist with the development, success, and maintenance of the Royal BC Museum. These include volunteers, who number over 500 and outnumber the Royal BC Museum staff 4 to 1; the Royal BC Museum Foundation (formerly Friends of the Royal BC Museum Foundation), a non-profit organization created in 1970 to support the Royal BC Museum financially and to assist its work by forming links within the community; Security Services, responsible for risk management, emergency response, security services, and business continuity expertise; and Property Management and Operations, who focus on sustainability, recycling, and environment control within the museum.

==History==
The BC Government founded the &quot;British Columbia Provincial Museum&quot; in 1886 in response to a petition from prominent citizens who were concerned about the loss of British Columbian natural products and native artifacts. Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie, Charles Semlin, William Fraser Tolmie, and former Premier George A. Walkem were amongst those who wanted to stop European and American museums from appropriating BC artifacts. Notably, the petitioners argued that the export of First Nations artifacts was particularly troubling, under the premise that “their loss [was] frequently irreparable.”

On October 25, 1886, the 15-by-20-foot Provincial Museum of Natural History and Anthropology opened in the Birdcages (the former BC Legislative buildings). The first curator was naturalist John Fannin, who donated his own large collection of preserved birds and animals to the museum. After its inception, the Royal BC Museum continually expanded. In 1896, the museum was given space in the east wing of the new Legislative buildings. The museum&#x27;s mandate was updated by the BC government in 1913, and the collection of natural history specimens and anthropological material became official parts of the museum&#x27;s operations, as well as the dissemination of knowledge to the people of British Columbia. In 1921, the basement of the east annex of the Legislature was excavated to provide the museum with additional room. 

As part of the 1967 Canadian centenary celebrations, BC Premier W. A. C. Bennett committed to building a new home for the Royal BC Museum. It opened on August 16, 1968, with a final construction budget of $9.5 million. The museum remains housed in this building.

One of the most prized displays is John Lennon&#x27;s psychedelic Rolls-Royce. It was purchased by Vancouver billionaire Jim Pattison and donated to the museum.

==Cultural precinct==
The museum is situated in the cultural precinct, an area comprising various significant historical buildings near the Inner Harbour. The cultural precinct occupies the space between Douglas Street, Belleville Street, and Government Street. Included in the cultural precinct is the BC Archives, Helmcken House, St. Ann&#x27;s Schoolhouse (built in 1844), the Netherlands Centennial Carillon, Thunderbird Park, and Mungo Martin House, Wawadit&#x27;la, a traditional big house built by Mungo Martin and his family.

==Permanent galleries==
The Royal BC Museum hosts 3 permanent galleries (Becoming BC, Natural History, and First Peoples galleries) focused on BC history and heritage.

===First Peoples gallery===

The First Peoples gallery on the third floor contains a large collection of First Nations artifacts, and many of the artifacts in the gallery are from the Haida people. Artifacts in the First Peoples Gallery include a village model, as well as indigenous totem poles, garb, and masks (including Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw ceremonial masks made by Chief Nakap&#x27;ankam (Mungo Martin)). Notably, the gallery maintains the long house of Chief Kwakwabalasami (Jonathan Hunt), a Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw chief from Tsaxis (Fort Rupert). The house and surrounding carvings were created by his son, Henry Hunt, and his grandsons, Tony Hunt and Richard Hunt. An exhibit of artist Bill Reid&#x27;s argillite carvings are also available for viewing.

The gallery has been criticized by indigenous scholars for its portrayal of First Nations people, and its use of controversial images and film from Edward Curtis. In 2010, many of the museum&#x27;s Nisga&#x27;a artifacts were returned to the Nisga&#x27;a people and now reside in the Nisga&#x27;a Museum in northwestern British Columbia.

In early 2023 a totem pole belonging to Nuxalk First Nations was returned after it was sold to the museum in 1915.

===Becoming BC galleries===

The Becoming BC galleries on the third floor (12,524 sq. ft.) begins with &quot;Century Hall,&quot; a collection of artifacts and replicas of BC&#x27;s history over the last 200 years. Visitors pass into &quot;Old Town,&quot; a life-sized model of Victoria in the 1870s–1920s. Old Town was designed and constructed between 1969 and 1972, and presents twenty separate building displays of various scales, including a replica of a cobblestone streetscape of early twentieth-century Victoria (with a silent movie theatre, a hotel, a train station, old automobiles, and Chinatown). The display shifts to a tour of early forestry, fishing, and mining industries (including a mine shaft and Cornish water wheel).

Also within the Becoming BC galleries is an exploration narrative containing models of the original Fort Victoria, a Port Moody train station, the 1902 Tremblay Homestead (from Peace River District), and a large-scale replica of Captain George Vancouver&#x27;s ship HMS &quot;Discovery&quot;.

===Natural history gallery===

The natural history gallery on the second floor (12,387 sq./ft.) contains information, artifacts, and life-sized displays of the diverse geography of the province from prehistoric time to present day (including the Fraser River delta and the popular woolly mammoth). There is a range of fossils and taxidermic specimens, and a tide pool that contains live crabs, limpids, and starfish, among constructed specimens.

More recently, a section on climate was added to the Natural History gallery, including information on the effects of modern climate change. Visitors may also view the Ocean Station in this gallery, a mock Victorian-era submarine that houses a 360-litre aquarium.

==Collections==
The Royal BC Museum&#x27;s collection policy states that the museum&#x27;s collection must pertain to the natural or human history of BC. The collection is divided into specific categories of &quot;significant objects,&quot; &quot;representative objects,&quot; and &quot;comparative objects.&quot; The Museum Act authorizes the Royal BC Museum to enable the preservation and management of the collection by securing, receiving, providing access to, and maintaining artifacts that adroitly illustrate the natural or human history of British Columbia.

===Human history===

The human history department aims to represent the cultural, social, and economic history of the peoples of BC. Collecting anthropological artifacts has been a practice of the Royal BC Museum since its founding in 1886. Currently, a significant number of artifacts from the human history department are being repatriated to First Nations groups. The Human History department is responsible for representing the material cultural history of BC.

====Archaeology====
This division of the Human History department houses over 192 000 artifacts. The Royal BC Museum holds the largest collection of First Nations archaeological material from BC.

====Ethnology====
The ethnology collection at the Royal BC Museum contains over 14 000 indigenous artifacts. These artifacts include both ceremonial and utilitarian objects and were collected from various First Nations groups around BC.

===Modern history===
The Modern History department is aimed at portraying BC&#x27;s history through material culture. There are 165 000 artifacts in the collection ranging from silverware to textiles to furniture to items related to canneries, mines, and breweries. Notably, the collection includes a lion&#x27;s head from the 1970s Vancouver Chinese Freemasons Athletic Club that exemplifies the traditional Hoshan style, as well as the Man Yuk Tong collection that preserves the authentic herbs, prescriptions, and miscellaneous implements used in the original Chinese Herbalist Shop.

===Natural history===
The Natural History department has been a part of the Royal BC Museum since 1886. The department includes curators, collection managers, and a mammal and bird preparator. The Natural History collections are divided into eight disciplines: Entomology, Botany, Mammalogy, Ornithology, Ichthyology, Invertebrate Zoology, Palaeontology, and Herpetology. This department develops the records representing the province&#x27;s biodiversity by collecting or accepting donations each year; processing them into the collections; and making the specimens and records available to the general public, as well as to scientific and educational communities.

====Palaeontology====

The fossil collection at the Royal BC Museum boasts approximately 55 000 specimens. The collection integrates specimens from all over BC ranging from 600 million years old to 20 000 years old. The palaeontology discipline also includes rock specimens from various mines around BC.

====Botany====
The botany discipline centres on the various plants of BC and the collection includes over 200 000 specimens. Notably, the Royal BC Museum houses one of the oldest native plant gardens in western Canada (begun in 1967), where approximately 400 native species grow.

====Invertebrate zoology====
The invertebrate collection is largely focused on marine, freshwater, and terrestrial invertebrate species from BC (insects, arachnids, and their relatives are represented in the entomology discipline). The collection consists of approximately 65 000 lots of marine and freshwater invertebrates, including marine molluscs, echinoderms, crustaceans, and polychaetes. This discipline also hosts a smaller global collection of dried gastropods, chitons, and bivalves. Notable specimens include more than 250 “type” specimens, each one used in the original description of a particular species.

====Entomology====
The entomology discipline focuses on specimens of insects, arachnids, and their relatives. As of 2010, the entomology collection included approximately 245 000 accessioned specimens and another 150 000 specimens not yet accessioned. The majority of the specimens are collected from BC, although some specimens have been culled from international areas. This collection provides basic information for assessing the status of BC insects and other terrestrial arthropods. It is also used to construct species range maps, supply useful information on species life histories and habitat requirements, and identify unknown specimens.

====Ichthyology====
The ichthyology discipline is primarily dedicated to studying the fish of BC. The collection consists of approximately 14 000 specimens of marine and freshwater fish.

====Herpetology====
This discipline is concerned with amphibians and reptiles of BC. The herpetology collection consists of approximately 5000 lots from BC.

====Ornithology====
This discipline mainly consists of bird specimens from BC, with a distinct focus on common seabirds, waterfowl, raptors, grouse, common shorebirds, alcids, gulls, woodpeckers, and common passerines. The ornithology collection contains 19 335 study skins, 3027 skeletons, 2713 clutches of eggs, 375 nests and 43 fluid-preserved specimens.

====Mammalogy====
This discipline focuses on a collection of mammals, the majority of which are from BC. The collection includes 18 000 specimens, largely made up of skeletons.

==Conservation==
The Conservation Services Department of the Royal BC Museum preserves the museum&#x27;s artifacts, documents, and specimens. Conservators speak to interested groups, lecture, consult, advise, and work with students and interns from conservation programmes around the world. The department was established in 1966 and was the first conservation lab in western Canada, and one of the first facilities for artifact conservation in Canada. In the 1970s and 1980s, conservators and conservation scientists worked with the Haida people on the preservation of the poles at Ninstints. Since the discovery of the remains of Kwäday Dän Ts’inchi in 1999, conservators have been involved with the Champagne and Aishihik people in recovery, analysis, treatment and publication projects.

==Learning and education==
The Learning and Visitor Experience initiative at the Royal BC Museum runs public programs, workshops, lectures, guided tours, and special events—all geared toward educating and engaging visitors. Roughly fifty school, family, and adult programs are scheduled per year. There are also annual events, including Remembrance Day commemorations, the Heritage Fair, and a Carol Along with the Carillon and other Christmas activities at Helmcken House.

===Living landscapes===
By 2002 the RBCM had initiated a successful and innovative province-wide research and public education program that explored human and natural influences on regional environments combining cultural heritage with natural heritage. The museum maintained a Living Landscapes website.

&quot;Living Landscapes&quot; was an award-winning, successful &quot;regional outreach program involving intensive cooperation with other museums, First Nations, educators, naturalists, and other agencies.&quot; Its goal was &quot;to encourage and facilitate the exploration and appreciation of the human and natural history of British Columbia from regional perspectives,&quot; and it focused on &quot;particular regions of B.C. and integrating stories and research locally generated with both research knowledge and descriptive information from the collections and curatorial staff at the Royal British Columbia Museum.&quot;

In 2000 the focus of &quot;Living Landscapes&quot; was on the Upper Fraser Basin, a &quot;vast area extending across most of south-central British Columbia including the Fraser River valley upstream from Big Bar Creek, as well as it is tributary drainages such as the Chilcotin, Quesnel, and Nechako Rivers.&quot; During 2001–2002 RBCM hosted five Upper Fraser Basin communities including, Valemount, British Columbia, Burns Lake, Williams Lake, Quesnel and Prince George attended by approximately 4,500 people. Visitors met and interacted with local Living Landscapes researchers and Victoria-based RBCM curators. The events featured exhibits from the RBCM&#x27;s permanent collections as well as &quot;illustrated talks and demonstrations on a variety of topics by local and museum experts.&quot;

Initially, &quot;Living Landscapes&quot; focused on &quot;in-field programming has been the northern, central and southern interior of British Columbia.&quot; In March 2006, when they had successfully completed the Northwest region, they discontinued the in-field programming.

==Exhibition arts==
The Exhibition Arts department began in the early 1970s, and now construct all of the Royal BC Museum exhibits in-house. The department is responsible for maintaining the permanent galleries and constructing the exhibitions, as well as setting them up and taking them down. The Exhibition Arts department is made up of specialists with a variety of skill sets, including carpenters, blacksmiths, metal workers, welders, and people who specialize in casting, finishing, jewellery, multimedia, lighting, large format printing, and software and hardware computation.

==Affiliations==
The museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.

==Publishing and publications==
The RBCM began publishing in 1891, when then-curator John Fannin published a Check List of British Columbia Birds. The museum has produced thousands of books, papers, pamphlets and other documents about its collections, research and activities since that time. Beginning in 1993, the RBCM distributes through major Canadian distributors, including the University of British Columbia Press and Heritage Distributors. The museum publishes around four titles per year and has more than forty books in print.

<text>Sufjan Stevens ( ; born July 1, 1975) is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. He has released ten solo studio albums and multiple collaborative albums with other artists. Stevens has received Grammy and Academy Award nominations.

His debut album, &quot;A Sun Came&quot;, was released in 2000 on the Asthmatic Kitty label, which he co-founded with his stepfather. He received wide recognition for his 2005 album &quot;Illinois&quot;, which hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart, and for the single &quot;Chicago&quot; from that album. Stevens later contributed to the soundtrack of the 2017 film &quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot;. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song and a Grammy nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media for the soundtrack&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Mystery of Love&quot;.

Stevens has released albums of varying styles, from the electronica of &quot;The Age of Adz&quot; and the lo-fi folk of &quot;Seven Swans&quot; to the symphonic instrumentation of &quot;Illinois&quot; and Yuletide-themed &quot;Songs for Christmas&quot;. He employs various instruments, often playing many of them himself on the same recording. Stevens&#x27; music is also known for exploring various themes, particularly religion and spirituality. Stevens&#x27; tenth studio album, &quot;Javelin&quot;, was released in October 2023.

==Early life, family and education==
Stevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and lived there until the age of nine, when his family moved to Alanson, Michigan, in the northern part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. He was raised by his father, Rasjid, and his stepmother, Pat, only occasionally visiting his mother, Carrie, in Oregon after she married her second husband, Lowell Brams (who later became the head of Stevens&#x27; record label Asthmatic Kitty). Stevens is of Lithuanian and Greek descent. &quot;Sufjan&quot; is a name of Arabic or Persian origin. The name was given to Stevens by the founder of Subud, an interfaith spiritual community to which his parents belonged when he was born.

Stevens attended the Detroit Waldorf School, Alanson Public Schools and Interlochen Arts Academy, and he graduated from Harbor Light Christian School. He then attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa. He then earned an MFA in Creative Writing from The New School in New York City.

While in school, Stevens studied the oboe and the similar English horn, which he plays on his albums. Stevens did not learn to play the guitar until his time at Hope College.

==Career==
===Early career and the Fifty States Project (1995–2006)===

Stevens began his musical career as a member of Marzuki, a folk-rock band from Holland, Michigan, as well as garage band Con Los Dudes. He also played (and continues to play) various instruments for Danielson Famile. During his final semester at Hope College, Stevens wrote and recorded his debut solo album, &quot;A Sun Came&quot;, which he released on Asthmatic Kitty Records. He later moved to New York City, where he enrolled in a writing program at The New School for Social Research. During his time at the New School, Stevens developed a preoccupation with the short story form, which he believed would lead him to write a novel, but ultimately returned him to songwriting.

While in New York, Stevens composed and recorded the music for his second album, &quot;Enjoy Your Rabbit&quot;, a song cycle based around the animals of the Chinese zodiac that delved into electronica.

Stevens followed this with the album &quot;Michigan&quot;, a collection of folk songs and instrumentals. It includes odes to cities including Detroit and Flint, the Upper Peninsula, and vacation areas such as Tahquamenon Falls and the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Melded into the scenic descriptions and characters are his own declarations of faith, sorrow, love, and the regeneration of Michigan. Beginning with the album, Stevens announced his intent to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. states, which he termed the Fifty States Project. Following the release of &quot;Michigan&quot;, Stevens compiled a collection of songs recorded previously into a side project, the album &quot;Seven Swans&quot;, which was released in March 2004. Stevens did not leave his job in the children&#x27;s book division at Time Warner until touring for &quot;Seven Swans&quot;.
Next, he released the second in the Fifty States project, titled &quot;Illinois&quot;. Among the subjects explored on &quot;Illinois&quot; are the cities of Chicago, Decatur and Jacksonville; the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893, the death of a friend on Casimir Pulaski Day, the poet Carl Sandburg, and the serial killer John Wayne Gacy. Stevens had spent the second half of 2004 researching and writing material for the album. As with &quot;Michigan&quot;, Stevens used the state of Illinois as a leaping-off point for his more personal explorations of faith, family, love, and location. Though slated for release on July 5, 2005, the album was briefly delayed by legal issues regarding the use of an image of Superman in the original album cover artwork. In the double vinyl release, a balloon sticker was placed over Superman on the cover art of the first 5,000 copies. The next printings had an empty space where the Superman image was, as with the CD release. &quot;Illinois&quot; was widely acclaimed and was the highest-rated album of 2005 on the review aggregator website Metacritic. The 2006 PLUG Independent Music Awards awarded Stevens with the Album of the Year, Best Album Art/Packaging, and Male Artist of the Year. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;No Ripcord&quot;, and &quot;Paste&quot; magazine named &quot;Illinois&quot; as the editors&#x27; choice for best album of 2005, and Stevens received the 2005 Pantheon prize, awarded to noteworthy albums selling fewer than 500,000 copies, for &quot;Illinois&quot;.

In April 2006, Stevens announced that 21 pieces of music he had culled from the &quot;Illinois&quot; recording sessions would be incorporated into a new album, called &quot;The Avalanche&quot;, which was released on July 11, 2006. On September 11, 2006, in Nashville, Tennessee, Stevens debuted a new composition, a ten-minute-plus piece titled &quot;Majesty Snowbird&quot;. On November 21, 2006, a five CD box set &quot;Songs for Christmas&quot; was released, which contains originals and Christmas standards recorded every year since 2001 (except 2004). Stevens undertook in the project initially as an exercise to make himself &#x27;appreciate&#x27; Christmas more. The songs were the work of an annual collaboration between Stevens and different collaborators, including minister Vito Aiuto; the songs themselves were distributed to friends and family.

Although Stevens&#x27; subsequent work was sometimes speculated to tie into future &quot;States&quot; projects, and Stevens himself would make occasional statements alluding to the future of the project, Stevens later admitted that the project had been a &quot;promotional gimmick&quot; and not one he had seriously intended to complete. In November 2009, Stevens admitted to &quot;Exclaim!&quot; magazine, in regard to the fact that he recently called his fifty-state project a joke, that &quot;I don&#x27;t really have as much faith in my work as I used to, but I think that&#x27;s healthy. I think it&#x27;s allowed me to be less precious about how I work and write. And maybe it&#x27;s okay for us to take it less seriously.&quot;

===Soundtrack album and various collaborative projects (2007–2009)===
Over the 2005 winter holidays, Stevens recorded an album with Rosie Thomas and Denison Witmer playing banjo and providing vocals. In April 2006, Pitchfork erroneously announced that Stevens and Thomas were having a baby together, and were forced to print a retraction. Witmer and Thomas later admitted it was an April Fools&#x27; prank. In December 2006, the collaborative recordings were digitally released by Nettwerk as a Rosie Thomas album titled &quot;These Friends of Mine&quot;. The album was released in physical form on March 13, 2007.

On May 31, 2007, Asthmatic Kitty announced that Stevens would be premiering a new project titled &quot;The BQE&quot; in early November 2007. The project, dubbed a &quot;symphonic and cinematic exploration of New York City&#x27;s infamous Brooklyn–Queens Expressway&quot;, was manifested in a live show. &quot;The BQE&quot; featured an original film by Stevens (shot in Super 8 film and standard 16 mm), while Stevens and a backing orchestra provided the live soundtrack. The performance used 36 performers which included a small band, a wind and brass ensemble, string players, horn players, and hula hoopers. There were no lyrics to the music. &quot;The BQE&quot; was commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of their Next Wave Festival and performed on three consecutive nights from November 1–3, 2007.

The performance sold out the 2,109 seat BAM Opera House without any advertising. After three weeks of rehearsing the piece with the three dozen musicians involved, he presented the 30-minute composition. &quot;The BQE&quot; was followed by an additional one hour of concert by Stevens and his orchestra. &quot;The BQE&quot; won the 2008 Brendan Gill Prize. In April 2007, in Brooklyn and Philadelphia, Stevens made unannounced appearances on Thomas&#x27;s tour in support of this album. In 2007, he played shows sporadically, including playing at the Kennedy Center to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Millennium Stage concerts.

Stevens has also worked as an essayist, contributing to Asthmatic Kitty Records&#x27; &quot;Sidebar&quot; feature and &quot;Topic Magazine&quot;. He wrote the introduction to the 2007 edition of &quot;The Best American Nonrequired Reading&quot;, a short story about his early childhood education and learning to read titled &quot;How I Trumped Rudolf Steiner and Overcame the Tribulations of Illiteracy, One Snickers Bar at a Time&quot;. That winter, he hosted an &quot;Xmas Song Exchange Contest&quot; in which winner Alec Duffy won exclusive rights to the original Stevens song &quot;Lonely Man of Winter&quot;. The track could only be heard by attending private listening parties at Duffy&#x27;s home in Brooklyn and at places around the world until 2018, when Duffy negotiated with Asthmatic Kitty Records to release the song with all proceeds going towards Duffy&#x27;s organization JACK.

Stevens has contributed to the music of Denison Witmer, Soul-Junk, Half-handed Cloud, Brother Danielson, Danielson Famile, Serena-Maneesh, Castanets, Will Stratton, Shannon Stephens, Clare &amp; the Reasons, Little Scream, and Liz Janes. In 2007 alone, Stevens played piano on The National&#x27;s album &quot;Boxer&quot;, produced and contributed many instrumental tracks to Rosie Thomas&#x27;s album &quot;These Friends of Mine&quot;, multiple instruments on Ben + Vesper&#x27;s album &quot;All This Could Kill You&quot; and oboe and vocals to David Garland&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Noise in You&quot;.

He has contributed covers of Tim Buckley (&quot;She Is&quot;), Joni Mitchell (&quot;Free Man in Paris&quot;), Daniel Johnston (&quot;Worried Shoes&quot;), John Fahey (&quot;Variation on &#x27;Commemorative Transfiguration &amp; Communion at Magruder Park&quot;), The Innocence Mission (&quot;The Lakes of Canada&quot;), Bob Dylan (&quot;Ring Them Bells&quot;), Drake (&quot;Hotline Bling&quot;), Prince (&quot;Kiss&quot;) and The Beatles (&quot;What Goes On&quot;) to various tribute albums. His versions of &quot;Free Man in Paris&quot; and &quot;What Goes On&quot; are notable for only retaining the lyrics of the original, as Stevens has taken his own interpretation on the melody and arrangement. His rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; has a similar rearranged melody and arrangement as well as a whole new verse.

His songs &quot;The Tallest Man, The Broadest Shoulders&quot; and &quot;All the Trees of the Field Will Clap Their Hands&quot; were featured in the 2006 British comedy-drama &quot;Driving Lessons&quot;, starring Julie Walters and Rupert Grint. In 2008, he produced &quot;Welcome to The Welcome Wagon&quot;, the debut album of Brooklyn-based husband and wife duo Vito and Monique Aiuto, The Welcome Wagon.

In February 2009, Stevens contributed &quot;You Are the Blood&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. In April 2009, Stevens uploaded a song about director Sofia Coppola online. This song was written while Stevens was in college, from a series of songs about names.

Stevens recalled:

A few weeks later, our dog got hit by a snowplow and I forgot all about the problem of names. Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) in the same way that Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with lens flare and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking?

===Solo studio albums (2009–2011)===

In September 2009, Stevens began performing four new songs while on his fall tour, &quot;All Delighted People&quot;, &quot;Impossible Soul&quot;, &quot;Too Much&quot; and &quot;Age of Adz&quot;. That year Stevens contributed to an album with his stepfather, Lowell Brams, titled &quot;Music for Insomnia&quot;. The album was released December 8, 2009. On October 6, 2009, Stevens&#x27; label, Asthmatic Kitty Records, released an album of versions of his 2001 album &quot;Enjoy Your Rabbit&quot; rearranged for strings and performed by the Osso String Quartet, titled &quot;Run Rabbit Run&quot;.

In 2010, Stevens was featured on The National&#x27;s album &quot;High Violet&quot;, released in May, and sang backing vocals for the band on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Following the release of &quot;High Violet&quot;, band frontman Matt Berninger mentioned that Stevens was recording a new album in the band&#x27;s studio and that The National would appear on some of the tracks. In early August, Stevens announced North American tour dates across dozens of cities. On August 20, 2010, Stevens suddenly and unexpectedly released a new collection of tracks, the &quot;All Delighted People&quot; EP, for digital download. The EP is built around two versions of the title track, &quot;All Delighted People&quot;. The EP surprisingly rose to No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums solely through its digital sales. On August 26, Asthmatic Kitty announced that Stevens would release his newest full-length album, &quot;The Age of Adz&quot;, on October 12. NPR streamed the album until it was released on October 12, 2010.

The two albums featured a wide range of arrangements, from orchestral to electronic. Song lengths were also extended; the track &quot;Djohariah&quot; from &quot;All Delighted People&quot; is 17 minutes long, while &quot;Impossible Soul&quot; from &quot;The Age of Adz&quot; is 25 minutes long. The albums also feature many styles from disco to folk.

Stevens has stated in interviews that in 2009 and 2010 he suffered from a mysterious debilitating virus infection that affected his nervous system. He experienced chronic pain and was forced to stop working on music for several months. He said: &quot;&quot;The Age of Adz&quot;, is, in some ways, a result of that process of working through health issues and getting much more in touch with my physical self. That&#x27;s why I think the record&#x27;s really obsessed with sensation and has a hysterical melodrama to it.&quot;

On October 12, 2010, Stevens began his North American tour in Montreal, featuring virtually all new material. The tour lasted just over a month and ended on November 15, 2010, in New York City. Stevens toured Australia and New Zealand in early 2011, featured as part of the Sydney Festival, and appeared on-stage with The National during the last of three sold-out Auckland shows. He also toured Europe and the United Kingdom in April and May 2011, playing there for the first time in five years. His shows mostly consisted of new material, but he did play many older tracks from &quot;Seven Swans&quot; and &quot;Illinois&quot;. Stevens ended the Age of Adz tour with two shows in Prospect Park, Brooklyn, New York.

===Further collaborative projects (2012–2014)===

On February 27, 2012, it was announced Stevens would release a collaborative EP titled &quot;Beak &amp; Claw&quot;, on March 20, with artists Son Lux and Serengeti under the name S / S / S on the Anticon record label. Stevens released a 7&quot; with close friend Rosie Thomas for Record Store Day 2012, titled &quot;Hit &amp; Run Vol. 1&quot;. He also collaborated with choreographer Justin Peck on two ballets for the New York City Ballet: &quot;Year of the Rabbit&quot; (2012) and &quot;Everywhere We Go&quot; (2014), both to great critical acclaim. Stevens, along with fellow Brooklyn musicians Nico Muhly and Bryce Dessner, began performing their classical project &quot;Planetarium&quot;, a song-cycle based around the planets in our solar system in countries such as England, The Netherlands, Australia and France from March to July 2012.

On October 2, 2012, it was announced that Stevens would release a second set of Christmas albums, titled &quot;Silver &amp; Gold: Songs for Christmas, Vols. 6–10&quot;, on November 13, 2012. &quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot; contains 58 songs, allowing for a total of 100 when combined with his first set of Christmas albums, &quot;Songs for Christmas&quot;. To support this new release, Stevens performed in 24 cities around the United States for his 2012 tour titled &quot;The Sirfjam Stephanapolous Christmas Sing-a-Long Seasonal Affective Disorder Spectacular Music Pageant Variety Show Disaster&quot;. On December 11, 2012, Stevens released &quot;Chopped and Scrooged&quot;, a Christmas-themed hip-hop mixtape featuring music from &quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot;.

As a part of Joyful Noise&#x27;s 2013 Flexi Disc Series, Stevens and Cat Martino, of Stranger Cat, recorded the single &quot;Take the Time&quot;. Martino has contributed to many of Stevens&#x27; past projects, including &quot;The Age of Adz&quot;. On March 18, 2014, Stevens released the self-titled album, &quot;Sisyphus&quot;, with Son Lux and rapper Serengeti.

===&quot;Carrie and Lowell&quot; (2015–2017)===
On January 12, 2015, Asthmatic Kitty Records announced that Stevens would release a new album called &quot;Carrie &amp; Lowell&quot;. Stevens shared the first single from the album, &quot;No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross&quot;, on February 16, 2015. &quot;Carrie &amp; Lowell&quot; was released on March 31, 2015. The album garnered critical acclaim upon its release. &quot;Stereogum&quot; placed the album on its best albums of the decade list in 16th place and described it as &quot;an elegant heartbreaker of an album&quot;, while &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked it the 43rd best album of the decade, calling it &quot;a special brew that makes even the most intimate personal moment feel parabolic&quot;.

The album follows the nuances and trials of life with Stevens&#x27; mother, Carrie, who was diagnosed bipolar and schizophrenic, was addicted to drugs, and abandoned him when he was a year old; it also includes Stevens&#x27; stepfather, Lowell Brams. Stevens also stated that the songwriting for the album was incited by his process of grieving and coming to terms with his and his mother&#x27;s relationship following his mother&#x27;s death due to stomach cancer in 2012. On January 26, 2015, Asthmatic Kitty Records announced a tour of North America, which began in April 2015, to coincide with the new album. Stevens also headlined the End of the Road Festival in the United Kingdom in September. On July 21, a second set of U.S. tour dates, which took place in October and November 2015, was announced.

After Stevens performed new compositions about the solar system alongside composers Nico Muhly and Bryce Dessner in Amsterdam in April 2012, it was reported in March 2017 that the three and James McAlister would produce an album. The &quot;80-minute concept album&quot;, titled &quot;Planetarium&quot;, was released in July 2017. On April 28, 2017, a live album and concert film, &quot;Carrie &amp; Lowell Live&quot; was released, featuring new interpretations, re-workings and expansions of the songs from &quot;Carrie &amp; Lowell&quot;. In addition to the live album, Stevens announced another &quot;Carrie &amp; Lowell&quot; companion piece, &quot;The Greatest Gift&quot;, released on November 24. It includes four unreleased songs from the album sessions, as well as several remixes and a demo.

===&quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot; and &quot;The Decalogue&quot; (2017–2019)===
In January 2017, it was announced that Stevens would contribute original songs written and recorded by himself for the coming-of-age romantic drama film &quot;Call Me by Your Name&quot;. The film was released on November 24, 2017, by Sony Pictures Classics. The soundtrack of the film features two new songs and a remix of an existing song by Stevens: &quot;Visions of Gideon&quot;, which has been described as containing &quot;lush orchestrations&quot; and &quot;staccato-heavy piano refrains&quot;, &quot;Mystery of Love&quot;, which was featured in the film&#x27;s trailer as well as the film itself, and an &quot;ethereal piano arrangement&quot; of &quot;The Age of Adz&quot; track &quot;Futile Devices&quot;. In his review of the film, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; writer Dominick Suzanne-Mayer praised Stevens&#x27; work as a composer on the film, noting that he &quot;has a perfect ear for the film&#x27;s portrayal of a summer that&#x27;s getting shorter by the day.&quot; In January 2018, &quot;Mystery of Love&quot; earned a nomination for the year&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Original Song. Later in the year, the song received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media. The song was featured in the second season of the Netflix series &quot;Sex Education&quot;.

In December 2017, Stevens released two versions of &quot;Tonya Harding&quot;, a song about the figure skater of the same name. The song&#x27;s video shows a clip of the eponymous skater performing at the 1991 US Figure Skating Championships. Two days later, the single was offered for digital download and streaming, to be followed later by a cassette and vinyl release, in two versions, the one featured in the video (subtitled &quot;in D major&quot;) and a piano-only arrangement (&quot;in E♭ major&quot;); in a short essay, Stevens revealed his intention to write a song about Harding since 1991. According to Stevens, &quot;I&#x27;ve been trying to write a Tonya Harding song since I first saw her skate at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 1991. She&#x27;s a complicated subject for a song partly because the hard facts of her life are so strange, disputable, heroic, unprecedented, and indelibly American.&quot; Stevens later revealed that the song was offered to the producers to the biographical film &quot;I, Tonya&quot;, which was released in the same period, but that they decided not to include it in the film.

In October 2018, Stevens performed and recorded with indie folk musician Angelo De Augustine a collaborative duo of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; single. On May 29, 2019, Stevens released two new songs, respectively titled &quot;Love Yourself&quot; and &quot;With My Whole Heart&quot;, which were released in celebration of Pride Month. Sam Sodomsky of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called &quot;With My Whole Heart&quot; &quot;five minutes of unabashed and (relatively) unadorned inspirational soft rock&quot; and &quot;Love Yourself&quot; &quot;similarly glowing&quot;. Pride-themed T-shirts designed by Stevens also debuted alongside the singles. He later stated that a portion of the song and shirts&#x27; proceeds would go to the Ali Forney Center in Brooklyn and the Ruth Ellis Center in Detroit, two organizations which aim to help LGBT youth. In October 2019, Stevens released an album titled &quot;The Decalogue&quot; with pianist Timo Andres. It is based on a ballet of the same name by Justin Peck, composed by Stevens.

===&quot;Aporia&quot;, &quot;The Ascension&quot;, and &quot;Convocations&quot; (2020–2022)===
On March 24, 2020, Stevens released a collaborative album with his stepfather, Lowell Brams, titled &quot;Aporia&quot;. In June, Stevens announced his eighth studio album, titled &quot;The Ascension&quot;, along with the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;America&quot;, which was released on July 3. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Video Game&quot;, was released on August 13, and the third single, &quot;Sugar&quot;, was released on September 15. &quot;The Ascension&quot; was released in full on September 25.

On May 6, 2021, Stevens released a five-volume album of meditation music, called &quot;Convocations&quot;. On July 7, 2021, Stevens announced the release of a collaborative album, called &quot;A Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot;, that he recorded with fellow folk singer-songwriter Angelo De Augustine. On the same day, they unveiled the cover and the first two singles, &quot;Reach Out&quot; and &quot;Olympus&quot;. &quot;A Beginner&#x27;s Mind&quot; is a concept album, each track being inspired by a different film from either the 20th or 21st century.

=== &quot;Reflections&quot; and &quot;Javelin&quot; (2023–present) ===
On April 18, 2023, Stevens announced the album &quot;Reflections&quot;, which contains duo-piano pieces he had written for Houston Ballet. Along with announcing &quot;Reflections&quot;, Stevens released the album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Ekstasis&quot;, a piece performed by pianists Timo Andres and Conor Hanick. &quot;Reflections&quot; was released on May 19, 2023, on Asthmatic Kitty Records.

On August 14, 2023, Stevens released the single &quot;So You Are Tired&quot;, alongside an announcement for an album to be released in October 2023, titled &quot;Javelin&quot;. The record is described as his first &quot;singer-songwriter&quot; album since 2015&#x27;s &quot;Carrie &amp; Lowell&quot;. The album includes contributions from Adrienne Maree Brown, Hannah Cohen, Pauline Delassus, Megan Lui, and Nedelle Torrisi, as well as the National&#x27;s Bryce Dessner, who contributed acoustic and electric guitar for the track &quot;Shit Talk&quot;.

On January 28, 2024, the musical &quot;Illinoise&quot; debuted at Chicago Shakespeare Theater. Based on the album &quot;Illinois&quot; in its entirety, and with additional music &amp; lyrics contributed by Stevens, it was directed &amp; choreographed by Justin Peck, who discussed the project with Stevens on and off for several years before they agreed to move forward with it. The story was written by Peck and Jackie Sibblies Drury. On March 19, it was announced that the show would transfer to the St. James Theatre on Broadway for a limited time from April 24 until August 10. This production received four nominations at the 77th Tony Awards, including Best Musical, Best Lighting Design of a Musical for Brandon Stirling Baker, and Best Orchestrations for Timo Andres, ultimately winning one for Best Choreography for Peck.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===

Stevens&#x27; sound has been most generally associated with genres such as indie folk, alternative rock, indie rock, indie pop, baroque pop, chamber pop, folk pop, avant-garde folk, lo-fi folk, and electronica. A multi-instrumentalist, Stevens is known for his frequent use of the banjo, but also plays guitar, piano, drums, woodwind, and several other instruments on his records, layered through the use of multitrack recording.

===Themes===
Stevens&#x27; work is known to explore themes of love, religion, outer space, and grief. His record label stated that 2010&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Adz&quot; featured themes of &quot;love, sex, death, disease, illness, anxiety, and suicide&quot;.

Despite many of his songs having spiritual allusions, Stevens does not identify as a contemporary Christian music artist or frequently discuss religion with the press. He told &quot;The Village Voice&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t think music media is the real forum for theological discussions. I think I&#x27;ve said things and sung about things that probably weren&#x27;t appropriate for this kind of form. And I just feel like it&#x27;s not my work or my place to be making claims and statements because I often think it&#x27;s misunderstood.&quot;

During a 2004 interview with Adrian Pannett for &quot;Comes with a Smile&quot; magazine, when asked how important faith was to his music, he said &quot;I don&#x27;t like talking about that stuff in the public forum because, I think, certain themes and convictions are meant for personal conversation.&quot; In a 2006 interview, he said &quot;It&#x27;s not so much that faith influences us as it lives in us. In every circumstance (giving a speech or tying my shoes), I am living and moving and being.&quot;

==Personal life==
Stevens has resided in Upstate New York near the Catskill Mountains since 2019. Before this, he lived in New York City for 20 years. He is a Christian. Stevens also stated in 2005 that he attended an Anglo-Catholic Episcopal church.

In September 2023, Stevens revealed in a post on Instagram that he had been hospitalized the previous month and diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome. He wrote that he was undergoing physical rehabilitation to relearn how to walk after the illness.

In October 2023, Stevens dedicated his new album &quot;Javelin&quot; to his partner, Evans Richardson, who died in April of the same year. Richardson had served as the chief of staff at the Studio Museum in Harlem, which is dedicated to showcasing the work of black artists; in 2021 he had also been elected as chair of the accreditation commission for the American Alliance of Museums, with &quot;a focus on diversity and access for the communities they serve&quot;. Stevens&#x27; dedication of &quot;Javelin&quot; to Richardson was the first time that Stevens had publicly discussed his sexuality.

<text>The Games of the New Emerging Forces (GANEFO; ) were the games set up by Indonesia as a counter to the Olympic Games. Established for the athletes of the so-called &quot;emerging nations&quot; (mainly socialist states and newly independent former colonies), GANEFO was the name given both to the games held in Jakarta in 1963 and the 36-member sporting federation established the same year. A second GANEFO scheduled for Cairo in 1967 was cancelled and GANEFO had only one subsequent event, an &quot;Asian GANEFO&quot; held in Phnom Penh in 1966.

Indonesia established GANEFO in the aftermath of IOC censure for the politically charged fourth edition of Asian Games in 1962 in Jakarta which Indonesia hosted and for which Taiwan and Israel were refused entry cards. This ran against the doctrine of the International Olympic Committee, which strove to separate politics from sport. The IOC&#x27;s eventual reaction was to suspend Indonesia indefinitely from the IOC. Indonesia had “thrown down a challenge to all international amateur sports organizations, which cannot very well be ignored,” in the words of IOC president Avery Brundage. This was the first time the IOC suspended one of its members, although Indonesia was readmitted in time for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

Indonesian president Sukarno responded that the IOC was itself political because it did not have the People&#x27;s Republic of China or North Vietnam as members; the IOC was simply &quot;a tool of the imperialists and colonialists.&quot; 
In his words: “The International Olympic Games have proved to be openly an imperialistic tool… Now let’s frankly say, sports have something to do with politics. Indonesia proposes now to mix sports with politics, and let us now establish the Games of the New Emerging Forces, the GANEFO… against the Old Established Order.” GANEFO itself would make it clear in its constitution that politics and sport were intertwined. The event was inspired by the anti-Western, anti-colonial movement and the ideas of the 1955 Bandung Conference.

Ten countries (Cambodia, China, Guinea, Indonesia, Iraq, Mali, Pakistan, Vietnam, and the USSR) announced plans to form GANEFO in April 1963, and another 36 signed on as members in November 1963. Despite its doctrine of separating sports and politics, the IOC nevertheless decreed that the athletes attending GANEFO would be ineligible to participate in the Olympic Games.

Sukarno would later form, with Chinese support, a &quot;Conference of New Emerging Forces, or&quot; CONEFO (&quot;Conference of New Emerging Forces).&quot;

== 1st GANEFO ==


===Participating states in 1st GANEFO===
The first edition of GANEFO was held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 10 to 22 November 1963. Athletes from 46 states dispatched about 2,700 athletes and seven nations sent staff and officials. In total, 51 states participated in the Games from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America such as Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, Cambodia, Chile, Ceylon, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, DPR Korea, the Dominican Republic, Finland, France, the German Democratic Republic, Guinea, Hungary, Indonesia, Iraq, Italy, Japan, Laos, Lebanon, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Palestine (the Jordanian West Bank and the Egyptian Gaza Strip), People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Philippines, Poland, Republic of Mali, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia, Thailand, Tunisia, Soviet Union, Syria, North Vietnam, the United Arab Republic, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia. Unlike the Olympics, there was also a team representing &quot;Arab Palestine.&quot;

No country, however, was represented officially by its national Olympics committee, for fear of IOC reprisals. For instance, the Soviet Union, in a show of solidarity, sent athletes to the first GANEFO, but in order not to jeopardise their position in the IOC, the Soviet athletes were not of Olympic calibre. Japan let their athletes of non-Olympic calibre attend the first GANEFO to take account of the host nation&#x27;s position of 1964 Summer Olympics. Nevertheless, in the lead-up to the first GANEFO, the Japanese NOC did receive a thinly-veiled threat from the American IOC President at the time, Avery Brundage, regarding Japanese participation in the first GANEFO.

===Commemorative stamps===
A set of eight postage stamps were issued by Indonesia on November 10, 1963 to publicise the GANEFO.

===Medal table at 1st GANEFO===
In the first edition of GANEFO, China was the highest-ranking country with 68 gold medals, Soviet Union the second, followed by the United Arab Republic on the third, Indonesia the fourth, and North Korea the fifth. In all, 48 countries reportedly won medals.


== 2nd GANEFO (1st Asian GANEFO) ==
The second edition of GANEFO had been planned to be held in Cairo, United Arab Republic, in 1967, but this was cancelled for various political reasons.

The second GANEFO was held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 25 November – 6 December 1966.

=== Participating nations in 2nd GANEFO (1st Asian GANEFO) ===
About 2,000 athletes participated in the 2nd edition of GANEFO from 17 nations (Cambodia, Ceylon, China PR, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, North Korea, Laos, Lebanon, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Palestine, Singapore, Syria, North Vietnam and Yemen). The games were opened by then Prince Sihanouk, the then Chief of State of Cambodia.

The second GANEFO was restricted to Asia, except Guinea which participated in the qualifying tournament in Pyongyang, North Korea, on 1–11 August 1965. Consequently, only 17 Asian countries participated in the second tournament in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 25 November – 6 December 1966 which was named &#x27;1st Asian GANEFO&#x27;.

===Medal table at 2nd GANEFO (1st Asian GANEFO)===

In the second edition of GANEFO, China PR was the highest-ranking country with 108 gold medals, North Korea the second, and the host nation, Cambodia, the third.

==2nd Asian GANEFO==
In September 1967 was announced a second Asian GANEFO to be held in Beijing, China, in 1970, but later Beijing dropped the plans to host the Games, which were then awarded to Pyongyang, North Korea. The Games never occurred, however, and the GANEFO organisation collapsed.

<doc id="1255189" wikidata="Q1758890" url="?curid=1255189" title="Michigan (album)">
<text>Michigan (styled Sufjan Stevens Presents... Greetings from Michigan, the Great Lake State on the cover) is the third studio album by American indie folk songwriter Sufjan Stevens, released on July 1, 2003, on Sounds Familyre, Asthmatic Kitty and Secretly Canadian in the US, and on Rough Trade in Europe. It is Stevens&#x27; third studio album and features songs referencing places, events, and persons related to the U.S. state of Michigan.

==Recording and production==
The album was recorded and produced entirely by Stevens, using relatively cheap equipment for a market release. All of the tracks were recorded using 2 Shure SM57s and an AKG C1000, running through a Roland VS880EX, at a sampling rate of 32 kHz (lower than the rates typically used in recording). &quot;Michigan&quot; was produced in Pro Tools, which Stevens has also used for his following albums.

The instrumentation was recorded in various locations: a home in Petoskey, Michigan; Buxton School in Williamstown, Massachusetts; the N. J. Rec. Room in Clarksboro, New Jersey; and throughout Brooklyn, including Stevens&#x27; apartment and those of his friends and St. Paul&#x27;s Church.

A 20th-anniversary re-release was released on June 13, 2023.

==Artwork==
Album art features original hand-paintings by &quot;Martha Stewart Living&quot; crafts editor Laura Normandin.

The two-disc vinyl edition of &quot;Michigan&quot; contains an inscription within the run-off groove of each LP side:
* &quot;Say YES to Michigan!&quot;: This was an old state tourism board slogan.
* &quot;Go! Tigers!&quot;: The Detroit Tigers are a Major League Baseball team based in Michigan.
* &quot;If you seek a Pleasant Peninsula, look about you&quot;: This is the English translation of Michigan&#x27;s state motto.
* &quot;The Great Lake State&quot;: This is a popular nickname for Michigan.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Michigan&quot; received acclaim from critics. Brandon Stosuy of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described the album as &quot;a beautiful, sprawling homage&quot; to the state, noting its &quot;lush production&quot;, but criticizing the excessive length of some of the album&#x27;s tracks. In December 2003, American webzine &quot;Somewhere Cold&quot; voted &quot;Michigan&quot; Album of the Year on their &quot;2003 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame&quot; list. A year later, in December 2004, &quot;Somewhere Cold&quot; voted &quot;Michigan&quot; Vinyl of the Year on their &quot;2004 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame&quot; list.

===Legacy===
Upon the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary, &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Chris DeVille stated: &quot;[Stevens&#x27;s] widescreen love letter to his home state was such a momentous leap forward... Sufjan has produced a wealth of fascinating, deeply affecting (and sometimes deeply affected) music over the years... Nowadays, aggressive guitar bands like Coliseum are considered punk or metal because indie rock is the kind of genre where neoclassical whiz kid Nico Muhly contributes string arrangements to seemingly every major record, where Régine Chassagne passionately rocks the accordion, where Bon Iver channels Richard Marx unironically. &quot;Michigan&quot;’s flurry of glockenspiels, oboes, trombones, and, yes, banjos had a lot to do with that.&quot;

By 2005, it had sold 27,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

The song &quot;Redford&quot; was the inspiration for the name of the protagonist of The Roots&#x27; 2011 album &quot;Undun&quot;, who used the song as the opening to a four-part instrumental movement at the end of the album.

==Track listing==
The vinyl release also includes alternate arrangements of &quot;Vito&#x27;s Ordination Song&quot; and &quot;Romulus&quot;.

The European re-release of the album in 2004 also contains the bonus tracks &quot;Marching Band&quot; and &quot;Pickerel Lake&quot;.

<doc id="1255195" wikidata="Q29651120" url="?curid=1255195" title="Personal Storage Table">
<text>In computing, a Personal Storage Table (.pst) is an open proprietary file format used to store copies of messages, calendar events, and other items within Microsoft software such as Microsoft Exchange Client, Windows Messaging, and Microsoft Outlook. The open format is controlled by Microsoft who provide free specifications and free irrevocable technology licensing.

The file format may also be known as a Personal Folders (File) or Post Office File. When functioning in its capacity as a cache for Outlook&#x27;s Cached Exchange Mode feature, it may be called an Off-line Storage Table (.ost) or an Off-line Folders (File).

==Overview==
In Microsoft Exchange Server, the messages, the calendar, and other data items are delivered to and stored on the server. Microsoft Outlook stores these items in a personal-storage-table (.pst) or off-line-storage-table (.ost) files that are located on the local computer. Most commonly, the .pst files are used to store archived items and the .ost files to maintain off-line availability of the items. This is an essential feature of Microsoft Outlook. 
The size of these files no longer counts against the size of the mailbox used; by moving files from a server mailbox to .pst files, users can free storage space on their mailservers. To use the .pst files from another location the user needs to be able to access the files directly over a network from their mail client. While it is possible to open and use a .pst file from over a network, this is unsupported, and Microsoft advises against it, as .pst files are prone to corruption when used in this manner.

Both the .pst and .ost files use a fixed-block-based allocation scheme; the file is enlarged by a fixed amount of bytes, and the file internally maintains information about the allocated and non-allocated blocks. So, when data files like email messages are added to a .pst file, its file size is automatically adjusted by the mail client (if necessary). When mail is deleted from a .pst file, the size of the .pst file will stay the same, marking the space as unallocated so that it will hold future data items. Recently removed data items can actually be recovered from .pst and .ost files.

To reduce the size of .pst files, the user needs to compact them.

== Data access ==
Password protection can be used to protect the content of the .pst files. However, Microsoft admits that the password adds very little protection, due to the existence of commonly available tools which can remove or simply bypass the password protection. The password to access the table is stored without the first and last XOR CRC-32 integer representation of itself
in the .pst file. Outlook checks to make sure that
it matches the user-specified password and refuses to operate if there is
no match. The data is readable by
the libpst project code.

Microsoft (MS) offers three values for the encryption setting: &quot;none&quot;,
&quot;compressible&quot;, and &quot;high&quot;.

*&quot;None&quot; the .pst data is stored as plain text.
*&quot;Compressible&quot; the .pst data is encrypted with a byte-substitution cipher with a fixed substitution table. 
*&quot;High&quot; (sometimes called &quot;better&quot;) encryption is similar to a WWII German Enigma cipher with three fixed rotors.

Note that neither of the two encryption modes uses the user-specified password as any part of the key for the encryption.

== Support ==
The .pst file format is supported by several Microsoft client applications, including Microsoft Exchange Client, Windows Messaging, and Microsoft Outlook; in the previous two, it was often used with a Personal Address Book (.pab) file, which stores address book. The .pst file format is an open format for which Microsoft provides free specifications and irrevocable free patent licensing through the Open Specification Promise.

The libpst project includes tools to convert .pst files into open formats such as mbox and LDAP Data Interchange Format. libpst is licensed under the GPL and is now included in Fedora 10. MVCOM is a commercially licensed COM Component that provides access to .pst files without MAPI.

There are tools to convert .pst to other formats or to upload to other online e-mails like Gmail, for example.

== Formats and size ==
The file is structured as a B-tree with 512 byte nodes and leaves. All PST files begin with the four-byte magic string &quot;!BDN&quot;, a four-byte CRC number, and a two-byte magic string of &quot;SM&quot;.

Outlook 2002 and earlier use ANSI (extended ASCII with a codepage) encoding for their .pst and .ost files. This format has a maximum size of 2 GiB (231 bytes) and does not support unicode. A file exceeding this size is likely to give error messages, such as &quot;.pst has reached maximum size limit,&quot; and could become corrupted. Although superseded, this format is supported by all Outlook versions, by Internet Message Access Protocol Version 4rev1 (IMAP4) accounts and by HTTP accounts.

From Outlook 2003 and onward, the new standard format for .pst and .ost files is Unicode (UTF-16 little-endian), with 64-bit pointers instead of 32-bit to allow larger than 2 GiB sizes. The limit became 20 GB for Outlook 2003-2007, and increased to 50 GB from Outlook 2010. A file that is created in the personal-folders format in Outlook 2003 or later is not compatible and cannot be opened by earlier versions.

As with any file, .pst files can become corrupted. Growth over the limit has been a consistent problem; ANSI .pst that grew beyond 2 GiB and Unicode .pst that grew beyond 20 or 50 GB would become unusable. The scanpst.exe tool has been included with all versions of Outlook to detect and repair .pst database corruption, and Microsoft at one point offered a special-purpose PST2GB that would simply truncate the file to 2 GiB to allow Outlook to repair it.

===Entourage and Outlook for Mac===

Microsoft Entourage was Microsoft&#x27;s email and personal information program for Mac OS X (replaced by Outlook for Macintosh in Microsoft Office for Mac 2011). While superficially similar to Outlook, it was an entirely different application, and used a unique database format which cannot be imported or exported, though user data can be imported and exported to and from another unique format called .rge (a bundle consisting of many individual files plus metadata). Entourage 2008, the current version as of May 2010, has no support for .pst files, though there exists Microsoft&#x27;s .pst import tool for Entourage 2004; however, the tool could only import .pst files from Outlook for Mac 2001, and not any Windows versions. Entourage&#x27;s replacement, Outlook for Office 2011 for Intel Macs, was able to import Outlook .pst files from Windows; however, data will be stored as many individual files, rather than in a single database such as .pst or the Entourage database.

Outlook for Mac 2001, which runs under Mac OS 9 or the Mac OS X Classic Environment, connects exclusively to Exchange servers, and to this day is closer to its Windows counterpart than Entourage is. It works directly with &#x27;Outlook 97-2002&#x27; .pst files, and can freely interchange those files with Outlook for Windows, as recent versions are still compatible with the older .pst format.
The limit for Outlook 2011 is 10GB.

<doc id="1255199" wikidata="Q2576790" url="?curid=1255199" title="Punu people">
<text>The Punu or Bapunu (Pungwe|Pungu|Uréwé) (&quot;Sira, Ban Sira&quot;), are a Bantu meta-ethnicity of Gabon and the Republic of Congo.

==History==
According to Magang-Ma-Mbuju and Mbumb Bwass the Punu people originated from the people called «Jagas» and came from Kasaï and Zambezi. According to them, it was the Punu people who had invaded the kingdom of Kongo in 1568 and they were known as Jagas.

Claude Hélène Perrot said that before the publication of the work of these two authors (Magang-Ma-Mbuju and Mbumb Bwass), many studies devoted to the Jagas had shown that this warrior group was of diverse origins, B.M. Batsikama and M. Ipari had concluded that the invaders of Mbanza Kongo in 1568 were populations of Kongo origin.
The Punu people migrated into The Republic of the Congo in the 16th century and migrated into Southern Gabon in the 18th century.

== Culture ==

=== White masks ===
One of the well known Punu art objects are the white masks with nine dots on the forehead symbolizing the nine Punu clans, now known as the Punu masks. The masks are life size, they can cover a person&#x27;s face. They are worn by the dancers in south Gabon. When there is a major community event the dancers wear these masks, one major event would be a dance performed for a secret society. Europeans have been trying to discover the Punu society for a long time, but not until June 1865 did the first European discover the first white mask. Later in 1925-30 Europeans had more access to the societies and the secrecy was less than before.

=== Black masks ===

Black masks in Punu culture were worn by dancers as training masks, which perform first to announce the arrival of the white mask dancer which is more experienced. Sometimes when a misfortune happens to a group they take white masks and paint them black. This type of mask is only danced with in the dark at night. Different from the other two masks, these masks are rarely found in a museum because they used to hide them very well, due to the belief that they are dangerous and they have an evil nature.

== Beliefs ==
The Punu believe in their God Nyambye, they feared evil spirits, they used to do chirurgical operations after someone death to find out the cause of the death however if the cause of the late person could not be found it was then the wizard (mulosi) from the family circle who should be held responsible. People were jealous of successful people and they believe that their jealousy would cause the successful person harm or death. Illness was always seen as a work of an evil spirit and the only way to heal was by a special ritual to cast away the evil spirit&#x27;s work.

== Diaspora ==
Newspaper adverts, seeking the capture and return of enslaved runaways, known as &#x27;Freedom Seekers&#x27;, have uncovered a young, female member of the Punu community living and working in East London in the early 1700s. Her intricate scarification marks, described as diamonds on her forehead and temples are those portrayed on the Mukudj, female ancestor masks of the Punu community in Gabon.

Punu carvers continue to model these masks on the women they consider most beautiful in the village.

The girl, aged about 16, resided with Captain Henry Lumley and his household at number 18 Prescott street, Goodman Fields, Aldgate. On the night of Thursday 14th January 1706, taking advantage of the Captain&#x27;s absence, she escaped her captivity, and was still free when the advert was printed three days later.

<text>James Lane Allen (December 21, 1849 – February 18, 1925) was an American novelist and short story writer whose work, including the novel &quot;A Kentucky Cardinal&quot;, often depicted the culture and dialects of his native Kentucky. His work is characteristic of the late 19th-century local color era, when writers sought to capture the vernacular in their fiction. Allen has been described as &quot;Kentucky&#x27;s first important novelist&quot;.

==Early life and education==
James Lane Allen was born near Lexington, Kentucky, to Richard and Helen Jane (Foster) Allen on December 21, 1849. Allen, the youngest child in the family, had four sisters Lydia, May, Sally, and Annie, and two brothers, John and Henry. Allen lived at the Scarlet Gate estate in Lexington in the late 1800s until age 22 years.

In 1872, Allen graduated from the University of Kentucky, Lexington, taught at Fort Spring, Kentucky, at Richmond and at Lexington, Missouri, and from 1877 to 1879 at the academy of the University of Kentucky, where he was principal and taught modern languages. In 1880, he was professor of Latin and English at Bethany College (West Virginia); and then became head of a private school at Lexington, Kentucky. Allen spent his youth in Lexington during the Antebellum era, the American Civil War, and the Reconstruction periods. His childhood heavily influenced his writing. He described living at Scarlet Gate in the introduction to &quot;A Kentucky Cardinal.&quot;

== Career in New York ==
In 1893, Allen moved to New York City, where he lived until his death. He was a contributor to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and other popular magazines of the time. His novels include &quot;The Choir Invisible&quot;, which was a popular best seller in 1897.
== Death and legacy ==
Allen died &quot;from insomnia&quot; in 1925, and is buried in Lexington Cemetery. At the northern edge of Gratz Park in Lexington is the &quot;Fountain of Youth&quot;, built in memory of Allen using proceeds willed to the city by him.

James Lane Allen School, an elementary school off Alexandria Drive in Lexington, Kentucky is named in his honor.

<text>Mountains of the Moon (Latin: &quot;Montes Lunae&quot;; , &quot;&quot; or &quot;Jibbel el Kumri&quot;) is a legendary mountain or mountain range in east Africa at the source of the Nile River. Various identifications have been made in modern times, the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo being the most celebrated.

== Ancient testimony ==
People of the ancient world—especially ancient Greek geographers—were long curious about the source of the Nile. A number of expeditions up the Nile failed to find the source.

Eventually, a merchant named Diogenes reported that he had traveled inland from Rhapta in East Africa for twenty-five days and had found the source of the Nile. He reported that it flowed from a group of massive mountains into a series of large lakes. He reported the natives called this range the Mountains of the Moon because of their snowcapped whiteness.

These reports were accepted as true by most Greek and Roman geographers, most notably by Ptolemy, who produced maps that indicated the reported location of the mountains. Late Arab geographers, despite having far more knowledge of Africa, also presumed the report was fact, and included the mountains in the same location given by Ptolemy.

== Modern identifications ==

It was not until modern times that Europeans resumed their search for the source of the Nile. The Scottish explorer James Bruce, who travelled to Gojjam, Ethiopia, in 1770, investigated the source of the Blue Nile there. He identified the &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot; with Mount Amedamit, which he described surrounded the source of the Lesser Abay &quot;in two semi-circles like a new moon ... and seem, by their shape, to deserve the name of mountains of the moon, such as was given by antiquity to mountains in the neighborhood of which the Nile was supposed to rise&quot;.

James Grant and John Speke in 1862 sought the source of the White Nile in the Great Lakes region. Henry Morton Stanley finally found glacier-capped mountains possibly fitting Diogenes&#x27;s description in 1889 (they had eluded European explorers for so long due to often being shrouded in mist). Today known as the Rwenzori Mountains, the peaks are the source of some of the Nile&#x27;s waters, but only a small fraction, and Diogenes would have crossed the Victoria Nile to reach them.

Many modern scholars doubt that these were the Mountains of the Moon described by Diogenes, some holding that his reports were wholly fabricated. G.W.B. Huntingford suggested in 1940 that the Mountain of the Moon should be identified with Mount Kilimanjaro (despite Kilimanjaro being a solitary mountain rather than a mountain range and not feeding the Nile at all), and &quot;was subsequently ridiculed in J. Oliver Thompson&#x27;s &quot;History of Ancient Geography&quot; published in 1948&quot;. Huntingford later noted that he was not alone in this theory, citing Sir Harry Johnston in 1911 and Dr. Gervase Mathew later in 1963 having made the same identification. O. G. S. Crawford identified this range with the Mount Abuna Yosef area in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia.

In another chapter he tells the story of the great explorer Henry Morton Stanley and why his discovery of the Mountains of the Moon in 1889 was refuted for decades and caused them to be removed from maps for many years.
* A 1937 Bengali adventure novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay has the name of &quot;Chander Pahar&quot;, meaning the &quot;mountains of the moon&quot;. The novel chronicles the adventures of an Indian boy in the forests of Africa.
* In a 1964 children&#x27;s book by Willard Price called &quot;Elephant Adventure&quot;, the story takes place in the Mountains of the Moon, where the wildlife trees and other vegetation are supposed to be of sizes at least one third larger than in the rest of Africa. Price cites a March 1962 article in National Geographic Magazine as the basis for his premise.
* &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot; is a song by Grateful Dead&#x27;s Robert Hunter (lyrics) and Jerry Garcia (music). Its first release on record was on their album AOXOMOXOA, released in 1969 by the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts label.

* In &quot;The Quest&quot; by Wilbur A. Smith, Taita the Magus in his search for the source of the Nile travels to the Mountains of the Moon where the witch Eos has established her lair. While the book doesn&#x27;t exactly allude that it&#x27;s the source of the Nile, it purports that the mountains are key in formation of the Kitangule River which is a key tributary of the Nile.

<text>The Duboce Triangle is a neighborhood of San Francisco, California, located below Buena Vista Park and between the neighborhoods of the Castro/Eureka Valley, the Mission District, and the Lower Haight.

The Duboce Triangle is served by Muni Metro and buses. Because of its location east of Buena Vista Heights and Twin Peaks, the area sees less fog than many places in San Francisco.

According to the 2010 neighborhoods map of the San Francisco Association of Realtors (SFAR), Duboce Triangle is bordered by Market Street on its southeastern side, by Castro Street to the West and by Duboce Avenue to the North. A 2006 definition by the city mayor&#x27;s Office of Neighborhood Services puts the neighborhood&#x27;s northern boundary further north at Waller Street (thereby including Duboce Park), while still excluding the San Francisco Mint building near Market Street.

== History ==
The name Duboce originates from Victor Duboce, a lieutenant colonel of the First California Volunteer Infantry regiment in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War.

Many of the houses in the neighborhood are 1906 flats in the classic revival style, with the earliest house dating from the 1870s (such as the house at 22 Beaver Street built in 1876). A Victorian apartment building at the Northern side of 400 Duboce Avenue which survived the 1906 earthquake, has been described as the country&#x27;s largest wooden structure to the West of the Mississippi.

From 1970 to 1984, the neighborhood was home to Scott&#x27;s Pit, the first lesbian biker bar in the city.

<text>Dennis Jon McKenna (born December 17, 1950, in Paonia, Colorado) is an American ethnopharmacologist, research pharmacognosist, lecturer and author. He is the brother of well-known psychedelics proponent Terence McKenna and is a founding board member and the director of ethnopharmacology at the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit organization concerned with the investigation of the potential therapeutic uses of psychedelic medicines.

== Education ==
McKenna received his Master&#x27;s degree in botany at the University of Hawaii in 1979. He received his doctorate in botanical sciences in 1984 from the University of British Columbia, where he wrote a dissertation titled &quot;Monoamine oxidase inhibitors in Amazonian hallucinogenic plants: ethnobotanical, phytochemical, and pharmacological investigations&quot;. McKenna then received post-doctoral research fellowships in the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, National Institute of Mental Health, and in the Department of Neurology, Stanford University School of Medicine.

== Career ==
McKenna&#x27;s research led to the development of natural products for Aveda Corporation as well as greater awareness of natural products and medicines. He has authored numerous scientific articles and books. He co-authored &quot;The Invisible Landscape&quot; with his brother Terence and &quot;Botanical Medicines: the Desk Reference for Major Herbal Supplements&quot; with Kenneth Jones and Kerry Hughes. McKenna spent a number of years as a senior lecturer for the Center for Spirituality and Healing, part of the Academic Health Center at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. He became a senior research scientist for the Natural Health Products Research Group at the British Columbia Institute of Technology in the Vancouver area.

His research has included the pharmacology, botany, and chemistry of ayahuasca and oo-koo-hé, the subjects of his master&#x27;s thesis. He has also conducted extensive fieldwork in the Peruvian, Colombian, and Brazilian Amazon.

==Psilocybin mushroom cultivation==

During the early 1970s McKenna along with his brother Terence, developed a technique for cultivating psilocybin mushrooms and they published what they had learned in a book titled &quot;Psilocybin - Magic Mushroom Grower&#x27;s Guide&quot;. McKenna and his brother were the first to come up with a reliable method for cultivating psilocybin mushrooms at home.

== Other ==
McKenna&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss&quot;, about his and his brother Terence&#x27;s life and journeys together, was published in 2012.

<text>Strong as Steel is the second studio album by Australian pop singer Tina Arena, released in 1990 by EMI.

==Album information==
The album has a very light tone and a pop rock feel to it compared to Arena&#x27;s subsequent albums, which were darker and more personal.

&quot;Strong as Steel&quot; was re-released in 1996 by Sony Music, however the re-release is substantially different from the original version. The cover art for the re-release is completely different and only five of the thirteen tracks from the original version are included. Five previously unreleased songs (including a demo destined for her next studio effort) recorded at a later date were added for a total of ten tracks on the new version. The uniqueness and rarity of the original 1990 version has made it a highly sought after collector&#x27;s item.

<doc id="1255244" wikidata="Q1477153" url="?curid=1255244" title="Musica reservata">
<text>In music history, musica reservata (also &quot;musica secreta&quot;) is either a style or a performance practice in &quot;a cappella&quot; vocal music of the latter half of the 16th century, mainly in Italy and southern Germany, involving refinement, exclusivity, and intense emotional expression of sung text.

==Definition==
The exact meaning, which appears in scattered contemporary sources, is a matter of debate among musicologists. While some of the sources are contradictory, four aspects seem clear:

# &quot;musica reservata&quot; involved the use of chromatic progressions and voice-leading, a manner of composing which became fashionable in the 1550s, both in madrigals and motets;
# it involved a style of performance, perhaps with extra ornamentation or other emotive methods;
# it used word-painting, i.e. use of specific and recognizable musical figures to illuminate specific words in the text; and 
# the music was designed to be performed by, and appreciated by, small groups of connoisseurs.

Composers in the style of &quot;musica reservata&quot; included Nicola Vicentino (spelled as &quot;Musica riserbata&quot;), who wrote about it in his &quot;L&#x27;antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica&quot; (1555); Philippe de Monte, the prolific composer of madrigals who mainly worked in Vienna; and above all, Orlande de Lassus, the renowned and versatile composer working in Munich whose &quot;Prophetiae Sibyllarum&quot;, probably written in the 1560s, may represent the peak of development of the style. The chord progression which begins the &quot;Prophetiae Sibyllarum&quot; is jarring even to ears accustomed to 20th-century music: the opening chords are C major – G major – B major – C minor – E major – F minor, all in root position, sung to the text: &quot;Carmina chromatico, quae audis modulata tenore&quot; – literally &quot;songs, which you hear rendered by a chromatic tenor&quot; (maybe with reference to all-chromatic composition which &#x27;technically&#x27; based on a chromatic tenor).

The style of &quot;musica reservata&quot;, with its implication of a highly refined, perhaps manneristic style of composition and performance along with a very small audience, is reminiscent both of the ars subtilior of the Avignon group of composers of the late 14th century, and also perhaps some of the contemporary avant-garde classical music of the late 20th century. The style can also be compared to the Italian composer Carlo Gesualdo&#x27;s chromatic madrigals and motets a few decades later.

<text>The Sira or Shira people, the &quot;Eshira&quot;, are a Punu ethnic group of Gabon primarily living in the forests and grasslands south of the Ogooué River and west of its tributary the N&#x27;Gounié.

==Origin and Ethnogenesis==

According to the oral tradition of the Sira or Punu 9 clans they migrated from the North via Egypt to Nubia where they settled in Merowé near the junctures of the Sira and Nile river between -500 BC and 100 AD. There by the Sira river was the place where they got that name from. From the 6th to the 18th century they migrated from Nubia via Uganda and DRC into their actual area, after wars with other groups. During the 19th century they traded Copper, and were highly regarded for their tobacco and raphia cloth. Their numbers were greatly reduced by smallpox epidemics in 1865 and 1898.

Paul du Chaillu travelled through Eshira areas in 1858 and 1864, and recorded that each clan controlled its own affairs. Mulenda of the Kamba clan was the most important of the chiefs; he owned 300–400 slaves, and died of smallpox in 1885. The Holy Ghost Fathers established a mission in 1895.

Subgroups of the Eshira include the Punu.

<text>Figure–ground organization is a type of perceptual grouping that is a vital necessity for recognizing objects through vision. In Gestalt psychology it is known as identifying a &quot;figure&quot; from the back&quot;ground&quot;. For example, black words on a printed paper are seen as the &quot;figure&quot;, and the white sheet as the &quot;background&quot;.

== Gestalt psychology ==

The Gestalt theory was founded in the 20th century in Austria and Germany as a reaction against the associationist and structural schools&#x27; atomistic orientation. In 1912, the Gestalt school was formed by Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, and Kurt Koffka. The word &quot;gestalt&quot; is a German word translated to English as &quot;pattern&quot; or &quot;configuration.&quot; Gestalt concepts can also be referred to as &quot;holism.&quot; Gestalt Psychologists were attempting to humanize what was considered a sterile approach. Gestalt psychology establishes that the whole of anything is greater than its parts. The concepts explored by Wertheimer, Köhler, and Koffka in the 20th century established the foundation for the modern study of perception.

&quot;The &quot;Gestalt&quot; concept is that &quot;not only movement, or process as such, but also the direction and distribution of process is determined dynamically by interaction.&quot; Sensory organization is not dependent upon isolated stimuli and local stimulation, but upon the relative properties of stimulation and the dynamical context.&quot;

Wertheimer described holism as the &quot;fundamental formula&quot; of Gestalt psychology: &quot;There are wholes, the behavior of which is not determined by that of their individual elements, but where the part-processes are themselves determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole.&quot;

==Examples==

The Rubin vase faces–vase drawing that Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin described exemplifies one of the key aspects of figure–ground organization, edge-assignment and its effect on shape perception. In the faces–vase drawing, the perceived shape depends critically on the direction in which the border (edge) between the black and white regions is assigned. If the edges between the black and white regions are assigned inward, then the central white region is seen as a vase shape in front of a black background. No faces are perceived in this case. On the other hand, if the edges are assigned outward, then the two black profile faces are perceived on a white background, and no vase shape is perceived. The human visual system will settle on either of the interpretations of the Rubin vase and alternate between them, a phenomenon known as multistable perception. Functional brain imaging shows that, when people see the Rubin image as a face, there is activity in the temporal lobe, specifically in the face-selective region.

An additional example is the &quot;My Wife and My Mother-in-Law&quot; illusion drawing. The image is famous for being reversible. &quot;The viewer may either observe a young girl with her head turned to the right or an old woman with a large nose and protruding chin, depending on one&#x27;s perspective.&quot;

The Flag of Canada has also been cited as an example of figure–ground reversal, in which the background edges of the maple leaf can also be seen as two faces arguing.

== Development ==
Figure–ground perception precedes all other visual perceptual skills and is one of the first to develop in a young baby. The development of perceptual organization develops as early as infancy in human beings. In regards to nature versus nurture, concepts such as &quot;lightness&quot; and &quot;proximity&quot; may develop as early as birth, but recognizing &quot;form similarity&quot; may not be functional until activated by particular experiences.

Three- to four-month olds respond to differences in lightness rather than differences in form similarity. It is suggested that scaffolding (the development of new skills over time based on the building of other skills) is responsible for the development of perceptual organization. Environment plays a major role in the development of figure-ground perception.

The development of figure–ground perception begins the day the baby can focus on an object. The faces of caregivers, parents, and familiar objects are the first to be focused on and understood. As babies develop, they learn to distinguish the objects they desire from their surroundings. Sitting up, crawling, and walking present ample opportunity to develop the skill during development. Between the ages of 2–4 the skill can be further cultivated by teaching the child to group or sort items.

==Perceptual process==
The perceptual decision in which the brain decides which item is the figure and which are part of the ground in a visual scene can be based on many cues, all of which are of a probabilistic nature. For instance, size assists in distinguishing between the figure and the ground, as smaller regions are often (but not always) figures. Object shape can assist in distinguishing figure from ground because figures tend to be convex. Movement also helps; the figure may be moving against a static environment. Color is also a cue because the background tends to continue as one color behind potentially multiple foreground figures, whose colors may vary. Edge assignment also helps; if the edge belongs to the figure, it defines the shape while the background exists behind the shape. However, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the two because the edge that would separate figure from ground is part of neither, equally defining both the figure and the background.

The LOC (lateral occipital cortex) is highly important for figure–ground perception. This region of the visual cortex (located lateral to the fusiform gyrus and extending anteriorly and ventrally) has consistently shown stronger activation in response to objects versus non-objects.&quot;

Evidently, the process of distinguishing figure from ground (sometimes called figure–ground segmentation) is inherently probabilistic, and the best that the brain can do is to take all relevant cues into account to generate a probabilistic best-guess. In this light, Bayesian figure–ground segmentation models have been proposed to simulate the probabilistic inference by which the brain may distinguish figure from ground.

Subjective factors can also influence figure–ground perception. For instance, if a viewer has the intention to perceive one of the two regions as the figure, it will likely alter their ability to analyze the two regions objectively. In addition, if a viewer&#x27;s gaze is fixated on a particular region, the viewer is more likely to view the fixated region as the figure. Although subjective factors can alter the probability of seeing the figure on one particular side of an edge, they tend not to overpower compositional cues.

== Artistic applications ==

Figure–ground organization is used to help artists and designers in composition of a 2D piece. Figure–ground reversal may be used as an intentional visual design technique in which an existing image&#x27;s foreground and background colors are purposely swapped to create new images.

==Non-visual==
Figure–ground perception can be expanded from visual perception to include non-visual concepts such as melody/harmony, subject/background and positive/negative space. The concept of figure and ground fully depends on the observer and not on the item itself.

In the typical sonic scenarios people encounter, auditory figure and ground signals often overlap in time as well as in frequency content. In these situations, auditory objects are established by integrating sound components both over time and frequency. A 2011 study suggests that the auditory system possesses mechanisms that are sensitive to such cross-frequency and cross-time correlations. Results of this study demonstrated significant activations in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the superior temporal sulcus related to bottom-up, stimulus-driven figure–ground decomposition.

In crowded rooms or parties, a person is able to zero in on the conversation they are having with one person (figure) while drowning out the background noise (ground). This can also be referred to as the &quot;cocktail party effect.&quot;

Figure–ground segregation in hearing is not automatic; rather, it requires attention and draws on resources that are shared across vision and audition.

==Types of figure–ground problems==

There are three types of figure–ground problems:
#The figure and the ground compete.
#The figure should be the ground and the ground should be the figure.
#The figure and ground create an optical illusion.

<doc id="1255281" wikidata="Q17007584" url="?curid=1255281" title="In Deep (Tina Arena album)">
<text>In Deep is the fourth studio album by Australian singer-songwriter Tina Arena, released by Columbia Records in Australia on 18 August 1997. The album entered the Australian ARIA Albums Chart at number 1 on 25 August 1997, knocking &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; by Hanson off the top spot, making it Arena&#x27;s second number-one album after &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;.

The singles released from &quot;In Deep&quot; were successful in most music markets, including Australia, France and New Zealand.

In France, &quot;In Deep&quot; peaked at number 3 on the French Albums Chart, stayed in the top 10 for 29 weeks, and spent a total of 79 weeks in the top 75. In New Zealand, the album entered the RIANZ Albums Chart at number 22, then moved up to its peak position of number 16 the week after, then spent a total of 6 weeks in the NZ top 50. &quot;In Deep&quot; has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide.

==Overview==
&quot;In Deep&quot; was recorded in Los Angeles, with production duties divided between Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones (who produced albums for Van Halen and Billy Joel) and David Tyson (who collaborated with Arena on &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;). Arena stated the album is &quot;essentially a live record&quot;, because concerts are what she thrived on; she also expressed that the album is &quot;international in spirit&quot; and that she did not want to make a record that sounded like her previous album, instead wanting to make a record that reflected her &quot;growth as a singer, writer, performer and human being&quot;.

Several tracks were substantially remixed for international editions of the album, and the track listing was additionally expanded and altered, notably to feature Arena&#x27;s duet with Marc Anthony, &quot;I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You&quot;, and the titular song from the musical &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, which was released in the United Kingdom. French-language tracks Arena recorded were also included on that region&#x27;s release. In total, the album yielded ten singles across its various editions: &quot;Burn&quot;, &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Love You&quot;, &quot;Now I Can Dance&quot;, &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, &quot;I Want to Know What Love Is&quot;, &quot;If I Was a River&quot;, &quot;I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You&quot;, &quot;Aller plus haut&quot;, &quot;Les trois cloches&quot; and &quot;Segnali di fumo&quot;; the latter three were exclusively released within French-speaking markets. The cover for the Australian version is slightly different and paler; Arena is centred on the cover between white borders.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;In Deep&quot; entered at number 1 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart but sales in Australia were not as high as her previous album &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot; (1994).

The album debuted at number 1 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart on 25 August 1997, knocking &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot; by Hanson off the top spot, making it Arena&#x27;s second number-one album. During its fourth week in the charts, the album regained the top spot for two consecutive weeks. &quot;In Deep&quot; spent a total of three weeks at number 1 and went on to spend a total of 60 weeks in the top 100, re-entering once, and being certified triple platinum by ARIA. It was the eighth-highest-selling album in Australia for 1997 and the eighty-fifth for 1998. It was also nominated for three ARIA Awards in 1998 for Highest Selling Album, Best Female Artist and Highest Selling Single for &quot;Burn&quot;.

In France, the album peaked at number 3 on the French Albums Chart, stayed in the top 10 for 29 weeks, and spent a total of 79 weeks in the top 75. The album became the 11th highest selling album in France for 1999 and the 18th highest selling album in 2000. The album was certified triple platinum in France by SNEP.

In New Zealand, it entered the RIANZ Albums Chart at number 22, then moved up to its peak position of number 16 the week after. The album spent a total of six weeks in the top 50 there.

In the United Kingdom, the album was not as successful as her previous top 20 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot;. &quot;In Deep&quot; peaked at number 102, spending two weeks in the top 200.

The singles released from &quot;In Deep&quot; were successful in most music markets, including Australia and France. Released in July/August 1997, &quot;Burn&quot; reached No. 2 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart—becoming Arena&#x27;s highest peak in Australia—and also peaking in the top 50 in New Zealand and the UK. &quot;Burn&quot; also made history when it became the fastest-added Australian song of all time in radio. The song was nominated for an ARIA Award for Highest Selling Single (see ARIA Music Awards of 1997). The French version also included Arena&#x27;s first French-language single, &quot;Aller plus haut&quot;. The song became a huge hit in France, where it peaked at number 2 for six consecutive weeks, becoming Arena&#x27;s highest peak there.

<text>Erich Stephen Gruen ( , ; born May 7, 1935) is an American classicist and ancient historian. He was the Gladys Rehard Wood Professor of History and Classics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught full-time from 1966 until 2008. He served as president of the American Philological Association in 1992.

==Biography==
Born in Vienna, coming from a Jewish family, he received BAs from Columbia University and Oxford University, and a PhD from Harvard University in 1964. Gruen was a varsity lightweight rower at Columbia and valedictorian of his 550-man graduating class. From 1957 to 1960, he was a Rhodes Scholar at Merton College, Oxford.

His earlier work focused on the later Roman Republic, and culminated in &quot;The Last Generation of the Roman Republic&quot;, a work often cited as a response to Ronald Syme&#x27;s &quot;The Roman Revolution&quot;. Gruen&#x27;s argument is that the Republic was not in decay, and so not necessarily in need of &quot;rescue&quot; by Caesar Augustus and the institutions of the Empire. He later worked on the Hellenistic period and on Judaism in the classical world.

Gruen taught what was purportedly his final undergraduate lecture course, The Hellenistic World, in the Fall of 2006. Despite his retirement from full-time teaching, he continues to oversee doctoral dissertations and is widely sought for visiting professorships. In addition to U.C. Berkeley, Gruen has taught at Harvard University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and Cornell University. He says that his most inspirational teaching experience, however, was a brief stint instructing prisoners at San Quentin State Prison in the late 2000s. At Berkeley, his students have included Kenneth Sacks.

In 1969–70 and 1989–90, Gruen was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship. He received the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art in 1998.

On September 26-27, 2024, the University of California at Berkeley held a two-day conference &quot;to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1974 publication of Erich Gruen&#x27;s landmark study, &quot;The Last Generation of the Roman Republic&quot;.&quot;

<text>The Nyanga River, 600 km, (French: &quot;Rivière Nyanga&quot;) is a river that runs through southern Gabon and northern Republic of the Congo. It is the second most important river in Gabon after the Ogooue. It is well known for the numerous rapids that break up its otherwise smooth course.

== Course ==

It rises on the border between the two countries, near the juncture of N&#x27;Gounié and Ogooué-Lolo provinces of Gabon, runs south along the border and then southwest through the Niari province of Congo, then enters the Nyanga province of Gabon and makes a sharp bend to the northwest. It passes through Nyanga&#x27;s capital Tchibanga (the largest city on the river), then gradually bends around to the southwest again, running through a series of rapids before coming out onto a coastal plain and emptying into the Atlantic Ocean.

<doc id="1255288" wikidata="Q385733" url="?curid=1255288" title="Vinegar Joe (band)">
<text>Vinegar Joe were an English Blues rock band, formed in 1971 in London. They released three albums on Island Records, but were best known for their live shows and launching the solo careers of Elkie Brooks and Robert Palmer.

==History==
Vinegar Joe evolved out of Dada, a 12-piece Stax-influenced, jazz/blues rock fusion band. Dada released one eponymous album in 1970, with a line up including vocalist Elkie Brooks and guitarist Pete Gage. Singer Robert Palmer, formerly with the Alan Bown Set joined Dada after the album had been recorded. Dada were signed by Ahmet Ertegun for Atlantic Records. After their US tour, Ahmet sub-licensed them to Chris Blackwell of Island Records for the UK and rest of the world, with instructions to reduce the line up to form Vinegar Joe in 1971, adding keyboard player Dave Thompson, but the band was still without a drummer. Phil Collins had unsuccessfully applied for the job. Conrad Isidore and Rob Tait drummed on the first album. Tim Hinkley added keyboards alongside Dave Thompson and it was Hinkley who appeared on the cover of the first album. Their debut LP &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; was released in April 1972 on Island Records in the UK and Atco Records in the US. The album cover featured plasticine models of the band created by John Padley.

Tim Hinkley took over from Thompson on keyboards and was succeeded by John Hawken. Drummer Rob Tait played the first series of live shows succeeded by John Woods. Mike Deacon took over on keyboards. During recording of their second album, &quot;Rock&#x27;n Roll Gypsies&quot;, also released in 1972, Keef Hartley played drums. Guitarist Jim Mullen also joined the band for this record and played on the US tour. The artwork for the album was supplied by Hipgnosis. Drummer Pete Gavin joined the band prior to the US tour and recording of their third and final album &quot;Six Star General&quot; released in 1973. The band dissolved in the spring of 1974. Alan Powell played drums during the band&#x27;s final weeks.

Subsequently, Brooks and Palmer went on to enjoy success as solo musicians. Gage became a record producer and arranger, working with Brooks, his wife, until their divorce, and a range of musicians such as Joan Armatrading and specialising in upcoming rockabilly and punk bands including as Restless and King Kurt.

<doc id="1255300" wikidata="Q3107424" url="?curid=1255300" title="Wales Green Party">
<text>The Wales Green Party () is a semi-autonomous political party within the Green Party of England and Wales (GPEW). It covers Wales, and is the only regional party with semi-autonomous status within the GPEW. The Wales Green Party puts up candidates for council, Senedd, and UK Parliament seats.

==Organisation, leadership and representation==
The current Leader of the Wales Green Party is Anthony Slaughter, with Phil Davies and Linda Rogers as co-deputy leaders. Wales-wide decisions are taken by the Wales Green Party Council, which is composed of the spokespeople, elected officers, and a representative from each local party.

As of 2023, the Wales Green Party is represented internally within the GPEW by Adam Turner and John Matthews, on the Green Party Regional Council (GPRC).

The Wales Green Party&#x27;s Amelia Womack served as the Deputy Leader of the Green Party of England and Wales from September 2014 to September 2022.

In April 2023, one of the Wales Green Party&#x27;s Co-Deputy Leaders, Amerjit Kaur-Dhaliwal, stepped down from their role, saying that &quot;volunteering at this time has become a luxury I can no longer afford, given the cost-of-living crises.&quot;

=== Leadership history ===
Pippa Bartolotti became Wales Green party leader in January 2012. She stood (unsuccessfully) for the leadership of the GPEW later that year. After four years of leadership, Bartolotti decided against standing for a further term as leader in the 2015 Leadership election which was won by Alice Hooker-Stroud, while Hannah Pudner became deputy leader. Alice was then re-elected in 2016 along with Grenville Ham and a returning Pippa Bartolotti as deputy leaders. Alice resigned in 2017, stating that her position had become &quot;untenable&quot; due to the voluntary nature of the role.
Alice was succeeded in early 2017 by Grenville Ham. Grenville defected to Plaid Cymru in late 2018 citing the party&#x27;s vote to remain a part of the Green Party of England and Wales rather than to become an independent party (as the Scottish Greens had previously done) as his reason. Like Alice, Grenville described his position as &quot;untenable&quot;. Mirka Virtanen was elected deputy leader in 2016 to begin in 2017, replacing Pippa Bartolotti, and Benjamin Smith was co-opted to the vacant deputy leader role in July 2017.

Anthony Slaughter (former deputy leader) was named the leader of the Wales Green Party in December 2018, beating Mirka Virtanen (deputy leader at the time) and Alex Harris in the leadership election. Duncan Rees was elected deputy leader. Mirka was co-opted back into the deputy leader role until December 2019. Lauren James was selected to replace her in April 2020.
===Green Isles Alliance=== 

The Wales Greens are represented on a Green Isles Alliance which includes Green parties from England and Wales (Plaid Werdd), Scotland, Ireland (Comhaontas Glas), Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man (Partee Glass Vannin). The alliance acts as a forum for the parties to advance shared political goals.

=== Membership ===

In July 2018, the Wales Green Party had around 1,500 members. In April 2023, the Wales Green Party was reported to have over 1,800 members. By the end of 2019, the Green Party in England and Wales had a combined 49,013 members (up from 38,707 in 2018). In October 2024, the Wales Green Party had 2,006 members.

==History==

=== Pre-1990 ===

The Green Parties in the United Kingdom have their roots in the PEOPLE Party which was founded in 1972, which became the Ecology Party in 1975, and then the Green Party in 1985.

In 1973, three Welsh Green candidates (P. Jones, W. Jones and V. Carney) won seats in the inaugural Welsh district council elections in the Gadlys and Town wards on Cynon Valley Borough Council. The party narrowly missed out on a fourth seat to the Labour Party.

=== Early years (1990s) ===

In 1990, the Scottish and Northern Irish branches left the UK Greens to form separate parties. The English and Welsh parties became the Green Party of England and Wales, with the Welsh branch being semi-autonomous.

In 1991, Marcus Hughes and Brian Stringer were elected to represent the Bynea and Dafen wards on Llanelli Borough Council In 1995, both then stood unsuccessfully as &#x27;Independent Green&#x27; candidates, losing their seats to Labour on the new Carmarthenshire County Council. In 1993, the Party won a county council seat on Anglesey (Ynys Môn) after a sitting councillor in the Aethwy ward had joined the Greens, but the Party did not defend this seat or stand any other candidates at the 1995 Isle of Anglesey County Council election two years later.

At the 1992 general election, local Greens entered an electoral alliance with Plaid Cymru in the constituency of Ceredigion and Pembroke North. The alliance was successful with Cynog Dafis being returned in a surprise result as the MP, defeating the Liberal Democrat incumbent by over 3,000 votes. The agreement broke down by 1995 following disagreement within the Welsh Green Party over endorsing another party&#x27;s candidate, though Dafis would go on to serve in parliament as a Plaid Cymru member until 2000, and in the National Assembly for Wales from 1999 until 2003. Dafis later stated that he did not consider himself to be the &quot;first Green MP&quot;.

On 29 August 1997, the Wales Green Party issued a joint declaration with the Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru, supporting the &#x27;Yes for Wales&#x27; campaign and the establishment of a new National Assembly for Wales in the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum.

=== Devolution (1999–present) ===

In the 1999 Welsh local elections, Klaus Armstrong-Braun became the first Green Party councillor to be elected to one of Wales&#x27; twenty two unitary councils, winning a seat on Flintshire County Council. In 2006, the party elected Ann Were as party leader, the first female leader of a Welsh political party.

In 2010, the party became the only Green party within the United Kingdom to have not elected a Green candidate to a UK or devolved legislature, after Caroline Lucas was elected to the UK Parliament. In 2011, the Green Party campaigned in support of a yes vote in the 2011 Welsh devolution referendum. In 2013, the Wales Green Party archive at the National Library was damaged in a fire with some historical material either destroyed or permanently damaged.

In 2015, the Party agreed to support as many powers for Wales as possible, &#x27;up to and including independence&#x27;. In the 2017 Welsh local elections, the Wales Green Party had their first county councillor elected to Powys County Council, for the Llangors ward.

In July 2018, the party held a vote on whether to split from the GPEW to form a separate organisation. Of those members who voted, 65% voted against the proposal, despite the leader Grenville Ham campaigning for independence. In October 2020, party members voted that they would campaign to support Welsh independence if a referendum was called on the matter, with party leader Anthony Slaughter arguing that many green policies could not be implemented in Wales without further devolved powers or independence.

In September 2021, Matt Townsend called for the party to become independent from its Westminster counterpart, despite members voting against it three years earlier. Writing in &quot;Bright Green&quot;, Townsend pointed out that the Scottish and Northern Irish Green parties were both independent from the GPEW. &quot;This has left Wales as one of very few nations around the world to not have its own Green Party,&quot; he said. Townsend also noted that whilst the Scottish Greens had now entered government with the SNP, the Wales Green Party failed to win any seats at the 2021 Senedd election. Slaughter told &quot;Nation.Cymru&quot; in August 2023 that, with the expansion of the Senedd in 2026, he expected Green MSs to be elected for the first time.

In their manifesto for the 2024 United Kingdom general election, the party committed itself to Welsh independence.

==Policies==

While associated mainly with environmentalist policies, the party has a history of support for communitarian economic policies, including well-funded, locally controlled public services within the confines of a steady-state economy. It is supportive of proportional representation voting systems and takes a progressive approach to social policies, including supporting a universal basic income and transitioning to a four day working week. It also supports the devolution of further powers to Wales. In October 2020, the party announced that it would campaign for Welsh independence should a referendum be held.

The party emphasises expanding localised renewable energy projects. Other policies within its &quot;Policies for a Sustainable Society in Wales&quot; include: phasing out waste incineration, improving public transport and supporting new safe standing areas in Welsh sports stadiums. Also included within the party’s policies is the commitment to &quot;bring the rail system, including track and operators, back into public ownership&quot;.

The party supports universal free school meals, both during school term time and during school holidays. The party also supports ending the two child benefits cap.

The Wales Green Party wants to raise Universal Credit by £40 per week, increase Pension Credit and provide an immediate uplift in disability benefits by 5%. The party also supports increasing the minimum wage to £15 an hour, with the cost to small businesses offset by reducing their national insurance.

In terms of state funding, the party is in favour of a yearly 1% tax on assets above £10 million and a 2% yearly tax on assets above £1 billion. It would also scrap the upper earnings limit so that high income earners pay more national insurance. Furthermore, the party would reform taxes on taxable gains from capital so that it equates to taxes earned from income. Another state revenue source it would seek is a £120 carbon tax per tonne of emitted carbon, as well as carbon taxing fossil fuel imports and fossil fuel extractions.

The party supports the creation of a free at the point of use National Care Service.

==Wales Young Greens==

Wales Young Greens is the youth and student &#x27;local group&#x27; of the Young Greens of England and Wales.

The current co chairs of the Young Greens of England and Wales are Jane Baston and Luanne Thornton.

==Welsh Green Pride==
Welsh Green Pride is the LGBTIQA+ Liberation group within the Wales Green Party. The group started a UK wide review of the discriminatory blood ban &#x27;which excludes any LGBTIQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Intersex &amp; Queer) people who have had sexual relations in the past 12 months from donating blood&#x27;. The group ran a petition and later met with Mark Drakeford which resulted in a review later being produced, and in 2021 the legislation was changed to allow men who had sex with men to give blood. 

==Electoral performance==

===Local elections===
: Figures do not include community or town councils.

===Senedd===

===Police and Crime Commissioners===

The party did not field candidates in the 2012, 2016 or 2021 police and crime commissioner elections in Wales.

===European Parliament (1994–2019)===
== Election campaigns ==

=== Local elections ===

==== 2022 ====

The 2021 Welsh local elections were postponed until 2022 to avoid a clash with the 2021 Senedd election, with the future electoral cycle also changed from four to five years by the Welsh Government. The Wales Green Party formed an electoral pact with Plaid Cymru to fight seats in Cardiff.

The party won eight seats in the election, exceeding a previous high of three seats held in the early 1990s (prior to the two tier system of county and district councils being abolished and replaced by twenty two new unitary councils in 1995). A further two were elected via an alliance with Plaid Cymru in Cardiff.

==== 2017 ====
In the 2017 Welsh local elections, the Welsh Greens elected their first ever councillor. In 2021 Powys councillor Emily Durrant defected to Plaid Cymru.

=== Senedd ===

==== 2021 ====

The Green Party stood a full set of regional list candidates as well as thirteen constituency candidates in the 2021 Senedd election.

Some of the party&#x27;s key policies for the 2021 Senedd election included: ending fees for people&#x27;s first university degree, targeting Wales to be carbon net zero by 2030 by replacing fossil fuels with onshore and offshore renewable energy, and introducing free public transport for local journeys for people in Wales aged under 21. The party also said it would build 12,000 homes to the highest environmental standards and would start a transformation fund to invest in local communities and create thousands of green jobs.

During the campaign, it was initially announced the party would be excluded from taking part in the BBC One Wales leaders debate scheduled for 29 April 2021. However, BBC Wales later announced that a revised format would allow the party to participate in the second half of the TV debate.

 Constituencies 

==== 2016 ====

In September 2015, Amelia Womack, Deputy Leader of GPEW, announced her intention to stand in the National Assembly elections for Wales Green Party. An ITV article titled &quot;Green deputy leader wants to switch to Welsh politics&quot; wrote of Newport-born Womack&#x27;s intention to stand in the Welsh elections saying; &quot;She&#x27;s seeking the nomination for the Cardiff Central constituency and – more significantly – hoping to be top of the Wales Green Party&#x27;s regional list for South Wales Central.&quot; Notably, the article went on to say &quot;Opinion polls have occasionally suggested that the Greens could gain a list seat in the Senedd&quot;.

On 10 February 2016, Welsh Greens abandoned progressive alliance negotiations a few months before the Senedd elections. The manifesto included plans to scrap the M4 relief road, build 12,000 new homes a year and provide free childcare to every child in Wales.

: DNS = Did not stand.

====2011====
The Wales Green Party again fielded candidates in all 5 top-up regions for the 2011 election. For the first time since 1999, the Greens also stood in a constituency - they once again opted to stand in Ceredigion.

During the 2011 campaign, they specifically targeted Labour voters with the aim of persuading them to use their regional list vote for the Greens, using the slogan &quot;2nd vote Green&quot;. They claimed that Labour list votes were &quot;wasted&quot; and that over 70,000 votes in South Wales Central went &quot;in the bin at every election&quot; as Labour had never won a top-up seat in that region.

On this occasion, South Wales Central was the region the party targeted. The region includes Cardiff, with its large student population, and also the constituency of Cardiff Central, the only Liberal Democrat-Labour marginal seat in Wales. Welsh Green leader and South Wales Central candidate Jake Griffiths stated they were also aiming to attract disaffected Liberal Democrat voters in the region.

The Greens polled 32,649 votes, 3.4% of the total votes cast for the regional lists. In South Wales Central, they took over 10,000 votes, 5.2% of the total, though they were still almost 6,000 votes away from winning a seat. The regional results were as follows:

In Ceredigion, Chris Simpson polled 1,514 votes, or 5.2%. He came fifth out of five candidates.

====2007====
In 2007, the party again fielded a list of candidates in each of the top-up regions but no candidates for the constituencies. The Wales Green Party proposed that Wales should &quot;be at the forefront of...a green industrial revolution&quot;. The party targeted South Wales West - the region where they had performed best in 2003.

The Welsh Greens polled 33,803 votes, or 3.5% of the total, a slight decrease on 2003. The party failed to win any seats, with their best performance this time being Mid and West Wales with 4.0% of the vote. In South Wales West their vote declined by one percentage point, their worst result of the five regions.

====2003====
In the 2003 election, the party again fielded a list of candidates for each of the electoral regions but this time stood no candidates for the constituencies. The Welsh Greens failed to win any seats, polling 30,028 votes, or 3.5%. Their best performance was in South Wales West where they polled 6,696 votes, or 4.8% of the total.

====1999====
In the 1999 inaugural election for the National Assembly, the Welsh Greens stood candidates in all five electoral regions used to elect &quot;top-up&quot; members of the assembly. Additionally, one candidate stood for the constituency seat of Ceredigion. The party stated that they aimed to poll around 7% of the vote and win at least one top-up seat.

The Welsh Greens ultimately polled 25,858 votes in the regional lists, 2.5% of the total, and 1,002 constituency votes (3.1%) in Ceredigion. No Welsh Greens were elected.

=== UK Parliament ===

==== 2019 ====

The Wales Green Party entered an electoral pact in eleven Welsh seats with Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats, as part of the Remain Alliance. As a result of this agreement, the party did not contest ten Welsh seats and instead supported pro-European Plaid Cymru or Liberal Democrat candidates. In the Vale of Glamorgan constituency, Anthony Slaughter stood for the Green Party as the Remain Alliance candidate but was not elected. The 2019 manifesto was titled &quot;If not now, when?&quot; and included various commitments, including taxing frequent flyers, creating more energy-efficient homes, decommissioning North Sea oil rigs and phasing out the UK’s coal industry.

==== 2017 ====

==== 2015 ====

The Wales Green Party fielded their highest number of UK general election candidates and achieved their best UK election result in Wales.

<doc id="1255304" wikidata="Q16851914" url="?curid=1255304" title="Just Me (Tina Arena album)">
<text>Just Me is the fifth studio album by Australian singer Tina Arena, released in Australia on 12 November 2001 by Columbia Records. Arena co-wrote tracks on the album with Desmond Child, Robbie Neville, Mark Hudson, Victoria Shaw and Peter-John Vettese. Debuting in the Australian ARIA Albums Chart top ten, &quot;Just Me&quot; was Arena&#x27;s third top ten album but the album was considered a commercial failure. Two singles taken from the album; &quot;Soul Mate #9&quot; and &quot;Dare You to Be Happy&quot; were not major hits, while the third single &quot;Symphony of Life&quot; became Arena&#x27;s fifth top ten hit.

==Writing and content==
The album was written mainly in Europe and the United States. Arena worked with different collaborators than on her previous albums including Nile Rodgers, Peter-John Vettese, Lukas Burton and Paul Manners, which Arena hoped would strengthen her appeal to both old and new fans. At the time, Arena stated &quot;I set out to make a record that reflected all of the personal, sonic and lyrical growth that I believe I have undergone in recent years. The only master plan, the only objective I set for myself, was to experiment and write the freshest sounding record I could - one that was truly an indication of where I am at in my life right now.&quot; She also states &quot;I don&#x27;t see this album as a continuation of my previous work. I think it is definitely a new beginning - almost a rebirth. That&#x27;s part of the reason it took a long time to make. I wanted to be sure about what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it, and I think it was good to gain a little bit of perspective away from a fairly relentless presence in this country.&quot;

She also states &quot;People are very curious - which is a really good thing but this is quite a departure, so I hope they like it. Making this record has given me a lot of emotional strength, and has allowed me the opportunity to share some of the things that have played an important part in my personal growth over the past few years. I have laid it all out there for the world to see - and I guess to judge. However overall, it&#x27;s a very positive and intimate record and I think people will identify with it.&quot;

She said, of working with producers/songwriters Rodgers and Vettese; &quot;I have to wait until I get into the studio with the producers for the sounds to really happen. That&#x27;s when all the magic starts. Nile and Peter were such encouraging producers to work with and they were able to come up with exactly what I was after. I was very excited to be working with Nile, given his incredible pedigree and Peter has to be one of the funniest and most talented men on the planet. It was important to be surrounded by positive people; but at the same time, I didn&#x27;t want to be around anyone who was hiding anything from me. I think that we achieved the perfect balance.&quot; The album also explores a new electronic sound for Arena, which is evident on &quot;Soul Mate #9&quot;, &quot;Symphony of Life&quot; and &quot;Woman&quot;. She stated &quot;It was fun to bop again, to move again. Bringing all those infectious beats into the mix - the ones that you can&#x27;t help but dance to - was really important.&quot;

==Chart performance==
The album debuted on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart on 19 November 2001 at number seven and was certified gold by ARIA. The album fell out of the top twenty in its second week and spent only four weeks in the top fifty and twelve weeks in the top one hundred. In France, despite debuting and peaking at number forty-seven, the album spent a total of forty-four weeks in the top one hundred and fifty and was eventually certified gold by the SNEP. The album was less successful in Switzerland, where it debuted at number seventy-four and peaked at number sixty-seven spending just three weeks in the top one hundred.

<doc id="1255309" wikidata="Q471317" url="?curid=1255309" title="Amillennialism">
<text>Amillennialism or amillenarism is a chillegoristic eschatological position in Christianity which holds that there will be no millennial reign of the righteous on Earth. This view contrasts with both postmillennial and, especially, with premillennial interpretations of Revelation 20 and various other prophetic and eschatological passages of the Bible.

Revelation 20:1-6 describes a vision in which, &quot;for a thousand years,&quot; Satan is bound &quot;so that he might not deceive the nations any longer,&quot; and &quot;the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark ... came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.&quot; Amillennialists interpret the &quot;thousand years&quot; symbolically to refer either to a temporary bliss of souls in heaven before the general resurrection, or to the infinite bliss of the righteous after the general resurrection, in the eternal state.

Amilennialists reject the view that Jesus Christ will physically reign on the Earth for exactly one thousand years. Rather, they interpret the &quot;thousand years&quot; mentioned in Revelation 20 as a symbolic number, not as a literal duration of time. Amillennialists hold that the millennium has already begun and is simultaneous with the current church age. Amillennialism holds that while Christ&#x27;s reign during the millennium is spiritual in nature, at the end of the church age, Christ will return in final judgment and establish a permanent reign in the &quot;new heaven and new Earth.&quot;

Many proponents dislike the term &quot;amillennialism&quot; because it emphasizes their differences with premillennialism rather than their beliefs about the millennium. &quot;Amillennial&quot; was actually coined in a pejorative way by those who hold premillennial views. Some proponents also prefer alternate names such as nunc-millennialism (that is, now-millennialism) or realized millennialism, although these other names have achieved only limited acceptance and usage.

==Variations==
There are two main variations of amillennianism, perfect amillenarism (the first resurrection has already happened) and imperfect amillenarism (the first resurrection will happen simultaneously with the second one). The common denominator for all amillenaristic views is the denial of the Kingdom of the righteous on Earth before the general resurrection.

===Perfect amillenarism===
* Marcion (c. 85 – 160) taught that only souls will resurrect, rejecting the bodily resurrection. He followed the teachings of Simon Magus (1st century) and Cerdo (1st–2nd centuries) [See. St. Irenaeus of Lyons, Against Heresies, 1, 27; St. Epiphanius of Cyprus, Panarion. Against the Marcionites, Heresies 22 and 42].
* Origen (c. 185 – 254) further developed the amillenarism of Marcion in his teaching about the reign of the saints in heaven while rejecting the idea of the Kingdom of the righteous coming down to the Earth [On the First Principles, book 2, chapter 11; Against Celsus, book 2, chapter 5]. This teaching was later supported by Gaius of Rome (died c. 217) [See Eusebius], St. Dionysius of Alexandria (died 265) [See Eusebius], and Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 263 – 340) [Church History, volume 3, chapter 28; volume 7, chapters 24-25].
* Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) taught about the reign of saints in heaven but denied the bodily resurrection [The Open Apocalypse, chapter 20].
* A.P. Lopukhin&#x27;s &quot;Explanatory Bible&quot; (Russian: &quot;Толковая Библия Лопухина&quot;) (1904–1913) argues that the first resurrection refers to the state of the righteous souls reigning in heaven, that is, &quot;they can be guides and helpers to the Christians who are still fighting the good fight of faith on the earth. The souls find in this a new source of joy and blessing.&quot;
* Joseph Sickenberger (20th century) interprets the first resurrection as the ascension of the souls of martyrs into heaven. The Millennium is for him &quot;a symbolic number&quot;.
* Charles Homer Giblin and Tadros Malaty (20th century) see the Millennium as the life of saints in heaven.
* Daniil Sysoev (1974–2009) taught that the first resurrection is the life and reign of the righteous souls in heaven.

===Imperfect amillenarism===
* According to Epiphanius of Salamis, writing between 374 and 377, the gnostic Cerinthus (1st–2nd centuries) believed that Jesus Christ &quot;ha[d] not yet risen but will rise when the general resurrection of the dead takes place.&quot; [See Epiphanius of Salamis, Panarion, 8 and 28, §6]. Thus, Cerinthus—whom Epiphanius charged with heresey—allegedly denied a distinct first resurrection. At the same time, he is said to have held that &quot;Jesus suffered and rose from the dead, but Christ, who had descended upon Him, went up to heaven without suffering. And the one who came down from heaven in the form of a dove is Christ, but Jesus is not Christ.&quot; [ibid., §1; St. Irenaeus of Lyons, Against Heresies, book 1, chapter 26].
* Ephrem the Syrian (c. 306 – 373) believed that the first resurrection would occur simultaneously with the second and both would constitute &quot;one resurrection&quot;. The Millennium signifies &quot;the immensity of eternal life&quot; [Discourse 96. On repentance].
* Theodoret of Cyrrhus (386–457) expressed similar views on the Millennium to those of Ephrem&#x27;s. [A Brief Exposition of Divine Dogmas, chapter 21].

==Teaching==
Amillennialism rejects the idea of a future millennium in which Christ will reign on Earth prior to the eternal state beginning, but holds:
* that Jesus is presently reigning from heaven, seated at the right hand of God the Father;
* that Jesus also is and will remain with the church until the end of the world, as he promised at the Ascension;
* that the millennium began with the resurrection of Jesus, the first resurrection (Colossians 1:18 [Jesus Christ] is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence; Revelation 20:4-6 [the millennium] is the first resurrection);
* that at Pentecost (or days earlier, at the Ascension of Jesus), the millennium began, citing Acts 2:16-21, wherein Peter quotes Joel 2:28-32 on the coming of the kingdom, to explain what is happening; and
* that, therefore the Church and its spread of the gospel is Christ&#x27;s Kingdom and forever will be.

Amillennialists also cite scripture passages that they believe to indicate that the kingdom of God is not a physical realm. Several verses cited by amillennialists in this context are:
* , where Jesus cites his driving out of demons as evidence that the kingdom of God had come upon them;
* , where Jesus warns that the coming of the kingdom of God can not be observed, and that it is among them; and
* , where Paul speaks of the kingdom of God being in terms of the Christians&#x27; actions.

Because amillennialists believe that the millennium is simultaneous with the present age, they also believe that the binding of Satan in Revelation 20, which occurs at the beginning of the millennium, has already occurred; in their view, he has been prevented from &quot;deceiv[ing] the nations&quot; by the spread of the gospel. Nonetheless, they maintain that good and evil will remain mixed in strength throughout history and even in the church, according to the amillennial understanding of the Parable of the Wheat and Tares.

Amillennialism is sometimes associated with Idealism, as both schools teach a symbolic interpretation of many of the prophecies of the Bible and especially of the Book of Revelation. However, many amillennialists do believe in the literal fulfillment of Biblical prophecies; they simply disagree with Millennialists about how or when these prophecies will be fulfilled.

==History==
===Early church===

Few early Christians wrote about this aspect of eschatology during the first century of Christianity, but most of the available writings from the period reflect a millenarianist perspective (sometimes referred to as chiliasm). Bishop Papias of Hierapolis (A.D. 70–155) speaks in favor of a pre-millennial position in volume three of his five volume work. Aristion and the elder John echoed his sentiments, as did other first-hand disciples and secondary followers. Though most writings of the time tend to favor a millennial perspective, the amillennial position may have also been present in this early period, as suggested in the Epistle of Barnabas, and it would become the ascendant view during the next two centuries. Church fathers of the third century who rejected the millennium included Clement of Alexandria ( 150 – 215), Origen (184/185 – 253/254), and Cyprian ( 200 – 258). Justin Martyr (died 165), who had chiliastic tendencies in his theology, mentions differing views in his &quot;Dialogue with Trypho the Jew&quot;, chapter 80: &quot;I and many others are of this opinion [premillennialism], and [believe] that such will take place, as you assuredly are aware; but, on the other hand, I signified to you that many who belong to the pure and pious faith, and are true Christians, think otherwise.&quot;

Certain amillennialists, such as Albertus Pieters, understand Pseudo-Barnabas to be amillennial, though many understand it instead to be premillennial. In the 2nd century, the Alogi (those who rejected all of John&#x27;s writings) were amillennial, as was Caius in the first quarter of the 3rd century. With the influence of Neo-Platonism and dualism, Clement of Alexandria and Origen denied premillennialism. Likewise, Dionysius of Alexandria (died 264) argued that Revelation was not written by John and could not be interpreted literally; he was amillennial.

Origen&#x27;s idealizing tendency to consider only the spiritual as real (which was fundamental to his entire system) led him to combat the &quot;rude&quot; or &quot;crude&quot; Chiliasm of a physical and sensual beyond.

Premillennialism appeared in the available writings of the early church, but it was evident that both views existed side by side. The premillennial beliefs of the early church fathers, however, are quite different from the dominant form of modern-day premillennialism, namely dispensational premillennialism.It is the conclusion of this thesis that Dr. Ryrie&#x27;s statement [that the early church fathers held dispensationalist views] is historically invalid within the chronological framework of this thesis. The reasons for this conclusion are as follows: (1) the writers/writings surveyed did not generally adopt a consistently applied literal interpretation; (2) they did not generally distinguish between the Church and Israel; (3) there is no evidence that they generally held to a dispensational view of revealed history; (4) although Papias and Justin Martyr did believe in a Millennial kingdom, the 1,000 years is the only basic similarity with the modern system (in fact, they and dispensational pre-millennialism radically differ on the basis of the Millennium); (5) they had no concept of imminency or of a pre-tribulational Rapture of the Church; (6) in general, their eschatological chronology is not synonymous with that of the modern system. Indeed, this thesis would conclude that the eschatological beliefs of the period studied would be generally inimical to those of the modern system (perhaps, seminal amillennialism, and not nascent dispensational premillennialism ought to be seen in the eschatology of the period).

===Medieval and Reformation periods===
Amillennialism gained ground after Christianity became a legal religion. It was systematized by Augustine of Hippo in the 4th century, and this systematization carried amillennialism over as the dominant eschatology of the Medieval and Reformation periods. Augustine was originally a premillennialist, but he retracted that view, claiming the doctrine was carnal.

Amillennialism was the dominant view of the Protestant Reformers. The Lutheran Church formally rejected chiliasm in The Augsburg Confession—&quot;Art. XVII., and condemned the Anabaptists (historically, most Anabaptist groups were amillennial) and others &#x27;who now scatter Jewish opinions that, before the resurrection of the dead, the godly shall occupy the kingdom of the world, the wicked being everywhere suppressed.&#x27;&quot; Likewise, the Swiss Reformer Heinrich Bullinger wrote up the Second Helvetic Confession, which asserts, &quot;We also reject the Jewish dream of a millennium, or golden age on earth, before the last judgment.&quot; John Calvin wrote in &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot; that chiliasm is a &quot;fiction&quot; that is &quot;too childish either to need or to be worth a refutation.&quot; He interpreted the thousand-year period of Revelation 20 symbolically, applying it to the &quot;various disturbances that awaited the church, while still toiling on earth.&quot;

===Modern times===
The Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches have long held amillennial positions, as has the Roman Catholic Church, which generally embraces an Augustinian eschatology and which has deemed that premillennialism &quot;cannot safely be taught.&quot; Amillennialism is also common among Protestant denominations such as the Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican, Methodist, and many Messianic Jews. Amillennialism represents the historical position of the Amish, Old Order Mennonite, and Conservative Mennonites (though among the more modern groups premillennialism has made inroads). Amillennialism is common among groups arising from the 19th century American Restoration Movement such as the Churches of Christ, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and Christian Churches and Churches of Christ. Amillennialism also has a following amongst Baptist denominations such as The Association of Grace Baptist Churches in England. Partial preterism is sometimes a component of amillennial hermeneutics. Amillennialism declined in Protestant circles with the rise of Postmillennialism and the resurgence of Premillennialism in the 18th and 19th centuries, but amillennialism has regained prominence in the West after World War II.

<doc id="1255311" wikidata="Q902978" url="?curid=1255311" title="Muskogean languages">
<text>Muskogean (also Muskhogean, Muskogee) is a Native American language family spoken in different areas of the Southeastern United States. Though the debate concerning their interrelationships is ongoing, the Muskogean languages are generally divided into two branches, Eastern Muskogean and Western Muskogean. Typologically, Muskogean languages are agglutinative. One documented language, Apalachee, is extinct and the remaining languages are critically endangered. 

==Genetic relationships==

===Family division===
The Muskogean family consists of six languages that are still spoken: Alabama, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee (previously referred to as Creek), Koasati, and Mikasuki, as well as the now-extinct Apalachee, Houma, and Hitchiti (the last is generally considered a dialect of Mikasuki). &quot;Seminole&quot; is listed as one of the Muskogean languages in Hardy&#x27;s list, but it is generally considered a dialect of Muscogee rather than a separate language, as she comments.

The major subdivisions of the family have long been controversial, but the following lower-level groups are universally accepted: Choctaw–Chickasaw, Alabama–Koasati, Hitchiti–Mikasuki, and Muscogee. Because Apalachee is extinct, its precise relationship to the other languages is uncertain; Mary Haas and Pamela Munro both classify it with the Alabama–Koasati group.

====Haas&#x27;s classification====
For connections among these groupings, the traditional classification is that of Mary Haas and her students, such as Karen Booker, in which &quot;Western Muskogean&quot; (Choctaw-Chickasaw) is seen as one major branch, and &quot;Eastern Muskogean&quot; (Alabama-Koasati, Hitchiti-Mikasuki, and Muscogee) as another. Within Eastern Muskogean, Alabama-Koasati and Hitchiti-Mikasuki are generally thought to be more closely related to each other than to Muscogee. That classification is reflected in the list below:
* Muskogean
** Western Muskogean
*** Chickasaw
*** Choctaw (also called Chahta, Chacato)
** Eastern Muskogean
*** Muscogee (also called Muskogee, Maskoke, Mvskoke, Seminole, and previously referred to as Creek)
*** Hitchiti-Mikasuki (also called Miccosukee)
*** Apalachee–Alabama–Koasati
**** Apalachee 
**** Alabama (also called Alibamu)
**** Koasati (also called Coushatta)
====Munro&#x27;s classification====
A more recent and controversial classification has been proposed by Pamela Munro. In her classification, the languages are divided into a &quot;Southern Muskogean&quot; branch (Choctaw-Chickasaw, Alabama-Koasati, and Hitchiti-Mikasuki) and a &quot;Northern Muskogean&quot; one (Muscogee). Southern Muskogean is the subdivided into Hitchiti-Mikasuki and a &quot;Southwestern Muskogean&quot; branch containing Alabama-Koasati and &quot;Western Muskogean&quot; (Choctaw-Chickasaw). The classification is reflected in the list below:
* Muskogean
** Northern Muskogean
*** Muscogee
** Southern Muskogean
*** Hitchiti-Mikasuki
*** Southwestern Muskogean
**** Apalachee 
**** &quot;Alabama–Koasati&quot;
***** Alabama
***** Koasati
**** &quot;Western Muskogean&quot;
***** Chickasaw
***** Choctaw
====Kimball&#x27;s classification====
A third proposed classification is that of Geoffrey Kimball, who envisions a threeway split among the languages, with &quot;Western Muskogean&quot; (Choctaw-Chickasaw), &quot;Eastern Muskogean&quot; (Muscogee), and &quot;Central Muskogean&quot; (Alabama-Koasati and Hitchiti-Mikasuki). However, Kimball&#x27;s classification has not received as much support as either Haas&#x27;s or Munro&#x27;s.

===Broader relationships===
====Possible Muskogean languages====
Several sparsely attested languages have been claimed to be Muskogean languages. George Broadwell suggested that the languages of the Yamasee and Guale were Muskogean. However, William Sturtevant argued that the &quot;Yamasee&quot; and &quot;Guale&quot; data were Muscogee and that the language(s) spoken by the Yamasee and Guale people remain unknown. It is possible that the Yamasee were an amalgamation of several different ethnic groups and did not speak a single language. Chester B. DePratter describes the Yamasee as consisting mainly of speakers of Hitchiti and Guale. The historian Steven Oatis also describes the Yamasee as an ethnically mixed group that included people from Muskogean-speaking regions, such as the early colonial-era native towns of &quot;Hitchiti&quot;, &quot;Coweta&quot;, and &quot;Cussita&quot;.

The Amacano, Chacato, Chine, Pacara, and Pensacola people, who lived along the Gulf Coast of Florida from the Big Bend Coast to Pensacola Bay, are reported to have spoken the same Muskogean language, which may have been closely related to Choctaw.

Sparse evidence indicates that a Muskogean language was spoken by at least some of the people of the paramount chiefdom of Cofitachequi in northeastern South Carolina. If so, that would be the most eastern outpost of Muskogean. The people of Cofitichequi were probably absorbed by nearby Siouan and Iroquoian speakers in the late 17th century.

A vocabulary of the Houma may be another underdocumented Western Muskogean language or a version of Mobilian Jargon, a pidgin based on Western Muskogean.

====Gulf====

The best-known connection proposed between Muskogean and other languages is Mary Haas&#x27; Gulf hypothesis, in which she conceived of a macrofamily comprising Muskogean and a number of language isolates of the southeastern US: Atakapa, Chitimacha, Tunica, and Natchez. While well-known, the Gulf grouping is now generally rejected by historical linguists. A number of Muskogean scholars continue to believe that Muskogean is related to Natchez.

==Features==
===Nouns===
Most family languages display lexical accent on nouns and grammatical case, which distinguishes the nominative from the oblique. Nouns do not obligatorially inflect for gender or number.

===Verbs===
Muskogean verbs have a complex ablaut system; the verbal stem almost always changes depending on aspect; less commonly, it is affected by tense or modality. In Muskogean linguistics, the different forms are known as &quot;grades&quot;.

Verbs mark for first and second person, as well as agent and patient (Choctaw and Chickasaw also mark for dative). Third-persons (he, she, it) have a null-marker.

Plurality of a noun agent is marked by either affixation on the verb or an innately plural verbal stem:

==Vocabulary==
Below is a list of basic vocabulary in five Muskogean languages from Broadwell (1992):

==Proto-language==

===Phonology===
Proto-Muskogean is reconstructed as having the consonants (given in IPA transcription):

The phonemes reconstructed by Haas as and show up as and (or ), respectively, in all Muskogean languages; they are therefore reconstructed by some as and . appears as in all the daughter languages except Muscogee for which it is initially and medially. The value of the proto-phoneme conventionally written (or ) is unknown; it appears as in Western Muskogean languages and as in Eastern Muskogean languages. Haas reconstructed it as a voiceless (that is, ), based partly on presumed cognates in Natchez.

===Lexicon===
Proto-Muskogean lexical reconstructions by Booker (2005) are as follows.

<doc id="1255316" wikidata="Q7688954" url="?curid=1255316" title="Taut foliation">
<text>In mathematics, tautness is a rigidity property of foliations. A taut foliation is a codimension 1 foliation of a closed manifold with the property that every leaf meets a transverse circle. By transverse circle, is meant a closed loop that is always transverse to the leaves of the foliation.

If the foliated manifold has non-empty tangential boundary, then a codimension 1 foliation is taut if every leaf meets a transverse circle or a transverse arc with endpoints on the tangential boundary. Equivalently, by a result of Dennis Sullivan, a codimension 1 foliation is taut if there exists a Riemannian metric that makes each leaf a minimal surface. Furthermore, for compact manifolds the existence, for every leaf formula_1, of a transverse circle meeting formula_1, implies the existence of a single transverse circle meeting every leaf. 

Taut foliations were brought to prominence by the work of William Thurston and David Gabai.

==Relation to Reebless foliations==
Taut foliations are closely related to the concept of Reebless foliation. A taut foliation cannot have a Reeb component, since the component would act like a &quot;dead-end&quot; from which a transverse curve could never escape; consequently, the boundary torus of the Reeb component has no transverse circle puncturing it. A Reebless foliation can fail to be taut but the only leaves of the foliation with no puncturing transverse circle must be compact, and in particular, homeomorphic to a torus.

==Properties==
The existence of a taut foliation implies various useful properties about a closed 3-manifold. For example, a closed, orientable 3-manifold, which admits a taut foliation with no sphere leaf, must be irreducible, covered by formula_3, and have negatively curved fundamental group. 

==Rummler–Sullivan theorem==
By a theorem of Hansklaus Rummler and Dennis Sullivan, the following conditions are equivalent for transversely orientable codimension one foliations formula_4 of closed, orientable, smooth manifolds M:
*formula_5 is taut;
*there is a flow transverse to formula_5 which preserves some volume form on M;
*there is a Riemannian metric on M for which the leaves of formula_5 are least area surfaces.

<doc id="1255319" wikidata="Q152545" url="?curid=1255319" title="Functional illiteracy">
<text>Functional illiteracy consists of reading and writing skills that are inadequate &quot;to manage daily living and employment tasks that require reading skills beyond a basic level&quot;. Those who read and write only in a language other than the predominant language of their environs may also be considered functionally illiterate in the predominant language. Functional illiteracy is contrasted with illiteracy in the strict sense, meaning the inability to read or write complete, correctly spelled sentences in any language. The opposite of functional illiteracy is functional literacy, or literacy levels that are adequate for everyday purposes. 

The characteristics of functional illiteracy vary from one culture to another, as some cultures require more advanced reading and writing skills than do others. In languages with phonemic spelling, functional illiteracy might be defined simply as reading too slowly for practical use, an inability to effectively use dictionaries and written manuals, and other factors. Sociological research has demonstrated that countries with lower levels of functional illiteracy among their adult populations tend to be those with the highest levels of scientific literacy among the lower stratum of young people nearing the end of their formal academic studies. This correspondence suggests that the capacity of schools to ensure students attain the functional literacy required to comprehend the basic texts and documents associated with competent citizenship contributes to a society&#x27;s level of civic literacy.

A reading level that might be sufficient to make a farmer functionally literate in a rural area of a developing country might qualify as functional illiteracy in an urban area of a technologically advanced country. In developed countries, the level of functional literacy of an individual is proportional to income level and inversely proportional to the risk of committing certain kinds of crime. In Russia, where more than 99% of the population is technically literate, only one-third of high school graduates can comprehend the content of scientific and literary texts, according to a 2015 study. The UK government&#x27;s Department for Education reported in 2006 that 47% of school children left school at age 16 without having achieved a basic level in functional mathematics, and 42% fail to achieve a basic level of functional English. Every year, 100,000 pupils leave school functionally illiterate in the UK. In the United States, according to &quot;Business&quot; magazine, an estimated 15 million functionally illiterate adults held jobs at the beginning of the 21st century. According to the National Center for Educational Statistics in the United States:
* About 70% of adults in the U.S. prison system read at or below the fourth-grade level, according to the 2003 National Adult Literacy Survey, noting that a &quot;link between academic failure and delinquency, violence and crime is welded to reading failure.&quot;
* 85% of US juvenile inmates are functionally illiterate.
* 43% of adults at the lowest level of literacy lived below the poverty line, as opposed to 4% of those with the highest levels of literacy.

The National Center for Education Statistics provides more detail. Literacy is broken down into three parameters: prose, document, and quantitative literacy. Each parameter has four levels: below basic, basic, intermediate, and proficient. For prose literacy, for example, a below basic level of literacy means that a person can look at a short piece of text to get a small piece of uncomplicated information, while a person who is below basic in quantitative literacy would be able to do simple addition. In the US, 14% of the adult population is at the &quot;below basic&quot; level for prose literacy; 12% are at the &quot;below basic&quot; level for document literacy, and 22% are at that level for quantitative literacy. Only 13% of the population is proficient in each of these three areas—able to compare viewpoints in two editorials; interpret a table about blood pressure, age, and physical activity; or compute and compare the cost per ounce of food items.

A Literacy at Work study, published by the Northeast Institute in 2001, found that business losses attributed to basic skill deficiencies run into billions of dollars a year due to low productivity, errors, and accidents attributed to functional illiteracy. The American Council of Life Insurers reported that 75% of the Fortune 500 companies provide some level of remedial training for their workers. , 30 million (14% of adults) were unable to perform simple and everyday literacy activities.

==UNESCO definition==
Illiteracy, as well as functional illiteracy, were defined on the 20th session of UNESCO in 1978 as follows:

<text>The bat falcon (Falco rufigularis) is a bird of prey in the family Falconidae, the falcons and caracaras. It is found in Mexico, Central America, Trinidad, and every mainland South American country except Chile and Uruguay.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The bat falcon was long known as &quot;Falco albigularis&quot;; the names &quot;Falco fusco-coerulescens&quot; or &quot;Falco fuscocaerulescens&quot;, long used for the aplomado falcon (&quot;F. femoralis&quot;), are now believed to refer to the present species.

The bat falcon has these three subspecies:

*&quot;F. r. petoensis&quot; 
*&quot;F. r. rufigularis&quot; 
*&quot;F. r. ophryophanes&quot; 

Some authors maintain that &quot;F. r. petoensis&quot; and &quot;F. r. ophryophanes&quot; are not subspecies but clinal variations in plumage. Others add a fourth subspecies &quot;F. r. petrophilus&quot; that is usually included in &quot;petoensis&quot;. Yet others assign only two subspecies, the nominate &quot;F. r. rufigularis&quot; and &quot;F. r. petrophilus&quot;.

The bat falcon and the orange-breasted falcon (&quot;F. deiroleucus&quot;) share plumage and vocal characteristics and may be sister species. Those two appear to be closely related to the aplomado falcon (&quot;F. femoralis&quot;).

==Description==

The bat falcon is long. Males weigh and have a wingspan of . Females weigh and have a wingspan of . They have long wings and a longish tail with a square tip. The sexes have similar plumage. Adults have blue-black head and upperparts with grayish edges on the feathers from the upper back to the uppertail coverts. Their throat, upper breast, and sides of the neck are white to buff, sometimes with some cinnamon; the rest of their breast is black with fine white bars. Their belly, thighs, and undertail coverts are chestnut-rufous. Their tail is blackish with thin white or grayish bars and a white or buff tip. The underside of their wings is black with fine white bars. Their cere and bare skin around the eye are bright yellow, their iris black-brown, and their legs and feet orange-yellow. Juveniles are duller and browner than adults, with a buffier throat, a tawny tinge to the breast&#x27;s barring, and black bars or spots on the undertail coverts. The three subspecies are similar, differing mainly in the tone of their plumage colors.

==Distribution and habitat==

The subspecies of the bat falcon are found thus:

*&quot;F. r. petoensis&quot;, from northern Mexico south through all of Central America and west of the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador, and extreme northwestern Peru
*&quot;F. r. rufigularis&quot;, Trinidad and from eastern Colombia east through Venezuela and the Guianas and south through eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, northern and eastern Bolivia, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina
*&quot;F. r. ophryophanes&quot;, central Brazil and adjacent eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina

A juvenile male of subspecies &quot;F. r. petoensis&quot; wandered to Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Alamo, Texas, in December 2021, for the only U.S. record of the species. It stayed in the area into early March.

&quot;F. r. rufigularis&quot; is resident on Trinidad and has been recorded as a vagrant on Tobago.

The bat falcon inhabits tropical forest. It favors unbroken mature forest but also occurs at the forest edge, in gallery forest, on wooded savanna, on cleared land with some remaining trees, and even in suburban and urban areas. In elevation it mostly ranges from sea level to about with a single record in Bolivia at about .

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The bat falcon is apparently mostly sedentary. However, the records in Texas, at high elevation in Bolivia, on Tobago, and on islands off the Yucatán Peninsula, Honduras, and Panama show a pattern of wandering.

===Feeding===

Bat falcons perch conspicuously on high, open snags, from which they launch aerial attacks on their prey. They also hunt in sustained flight. Most hunting is around dawn or dusk and often continues well past sunset. Their diet is eclectic; they hunt bats, birds (such as swifts, swallows, hummingbirds, parakeets, tanagers and small water birds), small rodents, snakes, lizards, frogs, and large insects such as dragonflies, butterflies, moths, grasshoppers, true bugs, beetles, and hymenopterans. In most areas vertebrates contribute the most to biomass consumed, varying from 66% to 96% in various studies, and birds made up between 32% and 85% of the vertebrates. Invertebrates dominate numerically, and young are fed large numbers of them. Bats generally contribute less than 14% of prey biomass but some pairs seem to specialize in them. 

===Breeding===

The bat falcon&#x27;s breeding season varies geographically. It spans from February to June in Mexico and northern Central America. It nests in February on Trinidad and probably between October and February in Argentina. Eggs have been noted in March in Venezuela, in April in Guyana, and in August near Manaus, Brazil. Most nests are in tree cavities, either natural or excavated by parrots, and between above the ground. Others have been noted in abandoned trogon nest cavities in arboreal termite nests, on cliffs, and on pre-Columbian ruins. The clutch size is two to four eggs. The incubation period is thought to be about 30 days, fledging occurs about 35 to 40 days after hatch, and young are dependent on the parents for at least 12 weeks after fledging. Both sexes incubate the eggs with the female doing at least 75% of the effort and in some areas all of it. Males provide food for incubating females and also most of the food for nestlings.
===Vocalization===

The bat falcon is vocal &quot;in breeding season, especially near nest, in contacts with other raptors, and even when attacking prey.&quot; Its main call is a &quot;rapid shrill screaming&quot; &quot;kee-kee-kee..&quot; or &quot;kew-kew-kew..&quot;; the male&#x27;s is higher pitched than the female&#x27;s. Other calls include &quot;an even higher and thinner “tsee-tsee-tsee...”&quot;, a &quot;low-intensity “chit” given in contact&quot;, and by the female, &quot;a whining or high-pitched wailing call with a wavering quality&quot;.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the bat falcon as being of Least Concern. It has an extremely large range and an estimated population of at least a half million mature individuals, though the latter is believed to be decreasing. No immediate threats have been identified. It is &quot;[w]idespread and generally not uncommon in appropriate habitat, it being one of the most widely distributed New World falcons.&quot; But it &quot;no longer breeds in several areas where forest extensively transformed to agriculture&quot; and &quot;pesticides [have] unquestionably affected breeding success&quot; in Mexico and Central America.

<text>The Dixie Hummingbirds (formerly known as The Sterling High School Quartet) are an influential American gospel music group, spanning more than 80 years from the jubilee quartet style of the 1920s, through the &quot;hard gospel&quot; quartet style of gospel&#x27;s golden age in the 1940s and 1950s, to the eclectic pop-tinged songs of today. The Hummingbirds inspired a number of imitators, such as Jackie Wilson and James Brown, who adapted the shouting style and enthusiastic showmanship of hard gospel to secular themes to help create soul music in the 1960s.

==History==
=== 1928–1938 ===
The group was formed in 1928 in Greenville, South Carolina, by James B. Davis and his classmate Barney Parks under the name the Sterling High School Quartet. After seeing the success of other quartet groups and realizing that there was not much work for African Americans in the South outside of low-paying labor jobs, the quartet decided to leave school and pursue their dream of being professional spiritual entertainers. By making this move, they had to change the name of the group to cut ties with the school. Davis recalls how they changed their name to the Dixie Hummingbirds:

The Hummingbirds traveled around the South singing spirituals. It was not until 1938 when James Bryant (formerly with the Heavenly Gospel Singers) joined the group that they start to sing Gospel. In September 1939 (Davis disputes the year as being 1938) the Hummingbirds drove to New York using contacts that Bryant had to record with Decca Records.

=== 1938–1939 ===
Bryant abruptly left the group after clashing with it following their return from recording in New York. With engagements picking up, they had to find a replacement and soon heard of Ira Tucker, a young singer from nearby Spartanburg, who became lead singer of the group at the age of 13.

Tucker introduced energetic showmanship – running through the aisles, jumping off stage, falling to his knees in prayer – copied by many quartets that followed. Tucker also took the lead in the stylistic innovations adopted by the group, combining gospel shouting and subtle melismas with the syncopated delivery made popular by the Golden Gate Quartet, as well as adventuresome harmonies, called &quot;trickeration&quot; by the group, in which another member of the group would pick up a note just as Tucker left it off.

=== 1940–1944 ===

As time progressed, the Hummingbirds decided to move up north as part of the Great Migration. The North provided better opportunities and was better in dealing with justice for African Americans. In 1941, the Hummingbirds moved to Washington, D.C., where Davis had an Aunt with whom they could stay. The group would eventually go to Philadelphia, where Barney Parks&#x27; father lived. Most importantly, they were promised work from Charlie Newsome, a booking agent they had met in Jacksonville, who had been managing a group called the Royal Harmony Singers.

In 1942, the Hummingbirds would make the move north with James Davis, Barney Parks, Ira Tucker, Wilson Baker and William Henry. Charlie Newsome arranged an audition for the Hummingbirds with John Hammond, an unofficial musical director for the Café Society, a black and tan club in New York. Hammond was looking for a gospel act to work in the club. Impressed with the Hummingbirds, they were given the gig. Hammond did not like the &quot;Dixie&quot; in their name. They changed their name so that they would not convey a suggestion of slavery. At that time they were performing under three names: the Dixie Hummingbirds in churches, the Swanee Quintet in Philadelphia, and the Jericho Quintet at the Café Society. While performing at the Café Society, the Hummingbirds were often backed by Lester Young&#x27;s sextet. William Henry was drafted into the military in 1943, when William Bobo replaced him. Hammond was fond of Henry and ended their contract with Café Society when he left the group.

=== 1945–1951 ===
Ira Tucker was asked to leave the Hummingbirds and join the Golden Gate Quartet. He told Davis, who urged him to try them out, which he did for a day and a half before deciding he could stay no longer. Barney Parks had to leave the group due to being drafted. Before he left, he helped find a replacement. He found Beachy Thompson of the Willing Four out of Baltimore, who at the time recently opened for the Hummingbirds at their anniversary program. The Hummingbirds signed to Regis Records, which changed its name to Manor Records, owned by Irving Berman, in 1945. In 1946, The Hummingbirds signed a record deal with Apollo Records, a growing New York Based label. Apollo Records also signed Mahalia Jackson.

=== 1952–1959 ===
The Hummingbirds had signed and recorded with Gotham and Okeh Records. They recorded for both labels and did not have any hits from either label. They continued to tour heavily. The Hummingbirds decided that they needed a new label. They went out to Texas the sign and record with Peacock Records under Don Robey.

These recordings proved successful and the Hummingbirds were back in the Billboard charts. Around this time, the Hummingbirds asked Howard Carroll to be a part of the group, replacing Paul Owens. Carroll did not do much singing; he preferred to play the guitar.

=== 1960–1976 ===
The group sang the backup vocals on Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Loves Me Like a Rock&quot;, and &quot;Tenderness&quot;, from his album &quot;There Goes Rhymin&#x27; Simon&quot;. In 1973, Robey sold Peacock to ABC Records, which released a cover of &quot;Loves Me Like a Rock,&quot; produced by Walter &quot;Kandor&quot; Kahn and the group&#x27;s lead vocalist Ira Tucker, which reached #72 on Billboard Magazine&#x27;s Top 100 R&amp;B Singles chart. The single also won a Grammy for &quot;Best Soul Gospel Performance.&quot; Kahn and Tucker produced an album for ABC entitled &quot;We Love You Like A Rock&quot;. The album contained Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Jesus Children&quot;, on which Wonder played keyboards.

William Bobo died On April 28, 1976 from Heart Disease.

=== 1977–present ===
James Davis retired In 1984, with Joe Williams(Formerly of The Sons Of The Birds) replacing him. 

Beachy Thompson died on June 28, 1994.

Guitarist Lyndon Baines Jones joined in 2000.

Carlton Lewis III joined in the 2003, and then sometime after he left but then returned when Ira Tucker got ill.

In 2003, the Hummingbirds were the subject of an award-winning book about their 75-year career span, &quot;Great God A&#x27;Mighty! The Dixie Hummingbirds: Celebrating the Rise of Soul Gospel Music&quot; by Jerry Zolten. The book was favorably reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on February 26, 2003. In February 2008, the first feature-length documentary/concert film featuring the life and history of the Dixie Hummingbirds was released in commemoration of their extraordinary eighty years as performers. &quot;The Dixie Hummingbirds: Eighty Years Young&quot; has been shown on the Gospel Music Channel and has played at numerous film festivals.

Produced and directed by award-winning filmmaker Jeff Scheftel, and executive produced by University of Hawaii musicologist Jay Junker, the film is now available on DVD, featuring extensive interviews with Ira Tucker Sr., Abraham Rice, Cornell McKnight, Lyndon Jones, Willie Coleman, Torrey Nettles, and William Bright with archival footage, and following the current group as they perform in numerous venues and rehearse under Mr. Tucker&#x27;s spirited guidance, in their hometown of Philadelphia, and across the vast landscape of America.

Barney Parks died on February 24, 2007.

Ira Tucker Sr. died due to complications from heart disease on the morning of June 24, 2008, at the age of 83. The group continued with the lineup of William Bright, Lyndon Baines Jones, Carlton Lewis III, Torrey Nettles and Cornell McKnight, thereby preserving the legacy left by the original members. 

Twin brothers Troy &amp; Roy Smith joined in 2015/2016.

William Bright died on February 4, 2017.

Howard Carroll died on October 17, 2017, at age 92 at an assisted living center in Philadelphia.

Enoch Webster died on November 27, 2020.

Lyndon Baines Jones died on February 17, 2021.

Abraham Rice died on November 26, 2022.

<text>Charles Lennox Richardson (16 April 1833 – 14 September 1862) was a British merchant based in Shanghai, Qing Empire who was killed in Japan during the Namamugi Incident. His middle name is spelled &quot;Lenox&quot; in the census and family documents.

==Merchant==
Richardson was born in London in 1833. He relocated to Shanghai in 1853 to seek his fortune in the China trade. In 1862, Richardson announced his retirement, and was en route back to England when he stopped over at the treaty port of Yokohama in September 1862.

==Namamugi Incident==

After Richardson met Woodthorpe Charles Clarke, an old friend from Shanghai, they joined fellow merchant William Marshall, and Marshall&#x27;s sister-in-law Margaret Watson Borradaile to go on a sightseeing ride via nearby Kanagawa town towards the temple of Kawasaki Daishi. While travelling on the Tōkaidō road – the Imperial highway – through the village of Namamugi, now part of Tsurumi ward, Yokohama, the party encountered the retinue of Satsuma regent &quot;daimyō&quot; Shimazu Hisamitsu, also known as Shimazu Saburō, heading in the opposite direction. 

When Richardson approached Shimazu&#x27;s palanquin too closely, the &quot;daimyō&quot;″s bodyguard attacked the Englishman. Marshall and Clarke were also severely wounded in the incident. Grievously wounded, Richardson fell from his horse a short distance from the attack and was killed with a coup de grâce on the orders of Shimazu.

The British government demanded reparations following the Namamugi Incident but when Shimazu refused to pay the reparations, a squadron of Royal Navy ships bombarded Kagoshima during the brief Anglo-Satsuma War the following year.

==Burial==
Following an autopsy conducted by William Willis, who had joined the British mission in Japan in 1861, Richardson was buried in a private plot near the Yokohama Foreign Cemetery between the later graves of Marshall and Clarke.

==Reception==
Several accounts exist regarding the cause of the altercation in which Richardson was killed. Louis G. Perez, Professor of Japanese History at Illinois State University, in &quot;Japan at War: An Encyclopaedia&quot; (2013), presents the following: per one account, Richardson and his party were turning their horses around to yield the road when the Satsuma retainers attacked preemptively to maintain the order of the procession. This arose from &quot;the language barrier and the retainers&#x27; anti-foreign zeal&quot;. Alternatively, it was claimed, Richardson and his cohort forced his way into the procession and were attacked by the retainers, outraged at the disrespect to their lord. In any case, the incident &quot;reflects the widespread anti-foreign sentiment that had emerged among many Japanese people since the country was forced open in 1854.&quot;

John W. Denney, in &quot;Respect and Consideration: Britain in Japan 1853-1868 and Beyond&quot; (2011), also emphasises the differing accounts, noting that &quot;the incontestable points are that Shimazu Saburō&#x27;s samurai killed Richardson and severely wounded Marshall and Clarke&quot;. The latter two men, at the official inquest, claimed that although they noticed samurai ahead, they did not know they were part of a daimyō&#x27;s retinue. On turning a corner, they recognised they were &quot;twelve men deep into the procession and close to the daimyō&quot;, but as &quot;none of the party had shouted or gesticulated at the Japanese in front of them&quot;, they were &quot;confident that no hostile moves would be made by the samurai.&quot; On attempting to turn around, a retainer struck Richardson with his sword, then inflicted a less severe wound on Marshall. Travelling at speed to escape the retinue, the men received further wounds.

The accounts of the men and Mrs Borradaile were the only ones given until 1875, when American E. H. House, a campaigning journalist and writer, published a pamphlet giving the Satsuma version of the incident. House stated that Richardson was &quot;notorious for his violent dealings with Chinese people during his residency in Shanghai&quot;, and his reputation had preceded him. He also claimed that, on passing Japanese acquaintances, Richardson&#x27;s party had asked why they had dismounted, this being customary for the passing of the daimyō, but not taken note of the explanation.

In light of the &quot;inexorable regulation&quot; that &quot;no casual passenger should continue to ride, either upon his horse or in any conveyance, during the occupancy of the road by a dignitary of high station&quot;, the Satsuma people felt that Richardson and his companions ought to have observed this. No Japanese would have been permitted to ride through the procession. Had Richardson and his companions given no &quot;offence other than that which might have proceeded from ignorance&quot;, they would have been unmolested. Richardson &quot;had continued to push his horse in and out of the groups forming the cortége&quot;, but had the party advanced in single file, rather than two abreast, &quot;they could have passed uninjured, as others had done before them, and others did after&quot;.

In a 2013 article, historian claimed that according to Japanese reports at the time, he disrespectfully rode in the middle of the road and even tried to get between the regent&#x27;s litter and his bodyguards. Per Reichert, just before the incident, after Mrs Borradaile, concerned by signs of hostility from the retinue, begged him not to provoke them. Richardson allegedly said, &quot;I have lived for fourteen years in China. I know how to manage these people.&quot; Per Denney, this must have been &quot;four years&quot;, as fourteen was not possible. Richardson&#x27;s uncle was reportedly not surprised about his nephew&#x27;s demise and blamed him for being reckless and stubborn. Frederick Wright-Bruce, the British envoy to China, remembered Richardson as an &quot;arrogant adventurer&quot;.
