<text>William Appleman Williams (June 12, 1921 – March 5, 1990) was one of the 20th century&#x27;s most prominent revisionist historians of American diplomacy. He achieved the height of his influence while on the faculty of the department of history at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and is considered to be the foremost member of the &quot;Wisconsin School&quot; of diplomatic history.

== Early life and education ==
Williams was born and raised in the small town of Atlantic, Iowa. He attended Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri, then earned a degree in engineering at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis. He graduated and was commissioned an ensign in 1945. After serving in the South Pacific as an executive officer aboard a Landing Ship Medium, he was stationed in Corpus Christi, Texas, where he made plans to become an aviator like his father. His father had been in the Army Air Corps until he died in a plane crash in 1929.

A wartime back injury caused enormous pain and ended his chances at becoming a naval aviator after the war. He requested a medical discharge from the navy in 1946 and moved to University of Wisconsin–Madison to begin graduate studies in 1947. He earned a master&#x27;s degree and a PhD there and came under the influence of the Beardian historians, especially Fred Harvey Harrington, Merle Curti, and Howard K. Beale. After teaching at various other colleges, he returned to Madison in 1957 to teach in the history department.

== Career ==
Williams completed his M.S. in 1948 and his Ph.D. in 1950. Subsequent additional research led to his first book, an expansion and revision of his doctoral thesis, published as &quot;American-Russian Relations, 1781-1947&quot; (1952). In the meantime, Williams pursued a series of appointments. His first, to Washington and Jefferson College, came in 1950. The following academic year (1951–52) Williams taught at Ohio State University, but (according to Williams) he had a faculty dispute with Woody Hayes (in his first year as football coach and, like Williams, a former naval officer) over low grades for a football player that Williams would not change, the incident apparently leading to his needing to find another appointment.

In the fall of 1952, Williams took up a tenure-track appointment to the University of Oregon where he would remain for five years (with a year in Madison, Wisconsin, again on a Ford Fellowship from 1955 to 1956). When Fred Harvey Harrington became the chair of the history department at the University of Wisconsin in 1957, he arranged for an unusual direct appointment of Williams as his replacement in teaching U.S. foreign relations. Williams accepted the tenure-track appointment and returned to Wisconsin in the fall of 1957 and remained there until 1968.

Williams was a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

=== &quot;The Tragedy of American Diplomacy&quot; ===
Graduate students found his challenges to the established historiography quite compelling and flocked to the university to study with him, regardless of their fields. The same year that his most influential book, &quot;The Tragedy of American Diplomacy&quot; was published, Williams&#x27;s students who were members of the campus&#x27;s Socialist Club, began publication of &quot;Studies on the Left&quot;, a manifesto of the emerging New Left in the United States. Like Williams, its articles offered a critique of the dominant liberalism, but after it moved to offices to New York in 1963, the club reflected less of his thinking and gradually declined and expired.

Williams departed from the mainstream of U.S. historiography in the 1950s. Whereas many U.S. historians wrote the story of the United States in terms of the expansion and spread of freedom, Williams argued that the U.S. had also expanded as an empire. Williams&#x27;s &quot;central conception of American diplomacy&quot;, one critic has written, is that it was shaped &quot;by the effort of American leaders to evade the domestic dilemmas of race and class through an escapist movement: they used world politics, he feels, to preserve a capitalist frontier safe for America&#x27;s market and investment expansion&quot;. In this regard, Williams&#x27;s understanding of American history owes a considerable debt to Frederick Jackson Turner and the first generation of American progressive historians. Because his history of American diplomacy pivots on John Hay&#x27;s Open Door Notes to China–at around the same time as the closing of the internal American frontier–Williams&#x27;s larger argument is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Open Door thesis&quot;. In &quot;The Tragedy of American Diplomacy&quot;, Williams described the Open Door Policy as &quot;America&#x27;s version of the liberal policy of informal empire or free trade imperialism.&quot;

Williams maintained that the United States was more responsible for the Cold War than the Soviet Union. Williams argued that American politicians, fearful of a loss of markets in Europe, had exaggerated the threat of world domination from the Soviet Union. Amid much criticism, Williams made no moral distinction between the foreign policy of Joseph Stalin in Eastern Europe and the foreign policy of the United States in Latin America, Africa, or Asia. In the context of the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, he went out of his way in an expanded second edition of &quot;The Tragedy of American Diplomacy&quot; (1962) to strongly criticize the behavior of the Soviet Union, but he noted the Kennedy Administration&#x27;s Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba as a parallel behavior. The difference in domestic policy between Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union and American democracy, he argued, made the U.S. embrace of empire all the more &quot;tragic.&quot;

Williams&#x27; &quot;The Tragedy of American Diplomacy&quot; is often described as one of the most influential books written on American foreign policy. Bradford Perkins, a traditionalist diplomatic historian emeritus at the University of Michigan, said this in a twenty-five-year retrospective on &quot;Tragedy&quot;: &quot;The influence of William Appleman Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedy of American Diplomacy&quot;... is beyond challenge&quot;. &quot;Tragedy&quot; brought Williams to the attention of not only academics but also American policymakers. Adolf A. Berle, a former member of FDR&#x27;s Brain Trust, was quite impressed with Williams after reading &quot;Tragedy&quot; and meeting him in person in Madison asked if he would be his &quot;personal first assistant&quot; in the new position Berle had taken in the Kennedy Administration as the head of an interdepartmental task force on Latin America. Williams turned down the offer to serve in the Kennedy Administration and later claimed that he was glad he had because of Kennedy&#x27;s sponsorship of the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Williams&#x27; historical success is consequent of his revisionist school of thought. His unorthodox ideology has become more recognised and celebrated since the book &#x27;The Tragedy of American Diplomacy&#x27;. According to a review by Richard A. Melanson, focusing particularly on Williams&#x27; historiography, &quot;his influence on a generation of American diplomatic historians has remained strong.&quot;

===Critic of Vietnam War===

Williams inspired a generation of historians to re-think the Cold War and was a critic of the Vietnam War. These included Gar Alperovitz, Lloyd Gardner, Patrick J. Hearden, Gabriel Kolko, Walter LaFeber, and Thomas J. McCormick, who, along with Williams, argued that the Vietnam War was neither democratizing nor liberating, but was an attempt to spread American dominance. He later edited a book of readings together with Gardner, LaFeber, and McCormick (who had taken his place at UW–Madison when Williams left to teach in Oregon) called &quot;America in Vietnam: A Documentary History&quot; in 1989.

During the 1960s, Williams&#x27; work became very popular among the New Left and Williams has been called &quot;the favorite historian of the Middle American New Left&quot;. However, the Wisconsin School and the New Left were distinct, with the latter more radical in outlook. Indeed Williams left the University of Wisconsin in the late 1960s in part because he disliked the militant direction that student protests were taking there.

===Oregon years===
Also tiring of the grind of teaching graduate students, Williams moved to Oregon in 1968 to, in the words of his biographer, Paul Buhle, &quot;teach undergraduates, live by the ocean, and live in a diversified community of &#x27;ordinary&#x27; Americans&quot;. While teaching at Oregon State University, Williams &quot;called for a return to the Articles of Confederation and a radical decentralization of political and economic power&quot;. &quot;Not only did he see the U.S. under the Articles as relatively anti-imperial, he also believed that the strong localism made possible under the Articles was the only form of governance suitable to real Americans living real lives&quot;.

Williams served as president of the Organization of American Historians in 1980. He retired from Oregon State University in 1988, and died in Newport, Oregon, in 1990. Always a bit eccentric and not a little idiosyncratic, Williams gave his interpretation of the nation&#x27;s past a moralistic tone, finding soul mates in conservatives like John Quincy Adams and Herbert Hoover. He always distrusted cosmopolitanism and championed small communities, while distrusting intellectuals who sneered at the unwashed masses. For all his radicalism, he never outgrew the kind of populist approach that he believed was an important part of the American heritage. In this sense he fit in well with his Wisconsin colleagues, William B. Hesseltine and Merrill Jensen, all of whom added to what has been called the &quot;Wisconsin school&quot; of historical interpretation.

== Criticism ==
To some degree, Williams&#x27;s economic interpretation of American diplomacy has been criticized on the same grounds as Charles A. Beard&#x27;s larger economic analysis of American history. In 1974, for instance, N. Gordon Levin Jr., compared Williams to Beard and argued that the Open Door model &quot;is inadequate because it insists on forcing all political-moral and strategic motivations&quot; for American foreign policy into &quot;the Procrustean confines&quot; of relentless economic expansion. Williams&#x27; response was that he was merely re-stating what American intellectual and political leaders said at the time.

Another serious critique of Williams&#x27;s work was offered by Robert W. Tucker in 1971, followed by Robert James Maddox and J. A. Thompson in 1973, and by Howard Schonberger in 1975. Tucker&#x27;s arguments challenged those of Williams by arguing that United States foreign policy had been generally passive, rather than aggressive, before 1939. Tucker&#x27;s arguments were elaborated and expanded later by other scholars. Maddox in &quot;The New Left and the Origins of the Cold War&quot; criticized Williams, Lloyd Gardner, and other revisionist scholars for alleged pervasive misuse of historical source documents and for a general lack of objectivity. Williams and the others published detailed rebuttals in the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; in 1973.

In 1986, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., whom Williams always distrusted for his closeness to power brokers, criticized him from a liberal perspective in &quot;The Cycles of American History&quot;. In the 1950s, Schlesinger had accused Williams of &quot;communist&quot; influence, because of Williams&#x27;s critique of U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union in &quot;American-Russian Relations&quot; and the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; article &quot;Second Look at Mr. X&quot;, a response to George F. Kennan&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article &quot;The Sources of Soviet Conduct&quot;, published under the moniker Mr. X in 1947.

More recently, Marc-William Palen and Mary Speck have called into question the application of the Open Door for the American Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as during this period the United States subscribed to closed door protectionist policies at home and abroad.

Williams&#x27; works and overall school of thought is evaluated and critiqued in Andrew J. Bacevich&#x27;s Journal Article. Bacevich brought into discussion the Vietnam anti-war movement coupled with the emergence of the &#x27;New Left&#x27; which surprisingly disappointed Williams, insinuating that the consequences made by the American people were unavoidable issues for the future. Denouncing the applauded historian, Bacevich suggests Williams&#x27; &quot;greatness was confined to a specific sphere.&quot; Evidently, Bacevich reviews Williams&#x27; political conscious and philosophical attributes as less celebrated.

===Revival===
Some of Williams&#x27; ideas about the imperial nature of American foreign policy have been revived by Andrew Bacevich, who uses them as a starting point for his own critique of U.S. policies since the end of the Cold War in &quot;American Empire&quot;.

The anniversary of the publication of &quot;Tragedy&quot; in 2009 occasioned a number of retrospectives and analyses of the longer-term impact of Williams&#x27; work, and such reconsideration inevitably identified the enormous impact of his work on the field and drew parallels between Williams&#x27; work and the state of U.S. foreign relations in the years after the attacks of September 11, 2001. The second edition of Michael Hogan&#x27;s edited collection of essays on postwar American foreign policy, now coedited with Frank Costigliola, noted that &quot;Williams&#x27; work remains influential well into the twenty-first century&quot;.

In 2001, Justus D. Doenecke wrote a review, evaluating Williams&#x27; work, implying that the &quot;crux of Williams&#x27;s foreign policy&quot; is within his thesis that the United States had become engaged in an &quot;economic expansion and the creation of an informal empire.&quot; This idea of an &#x27;American Empire&#x27; is also talked about in J.A. Thompson&#x27;s &#x27;William Appleman Williams and the &#x27;American Empire&#x27;.&#x27; Thompson echoes this school of thought, claiming that Williams&#x27; line of argument toward American Foreign Policy &quot;has always been an expansionist, imperialist power.&quot;

<text>Júlio Medaglia (born 1938) is a Brazilian composer, arranger, and conductor. Born in São Paulo, he studied theory and conducting with Hans-Joachim Koellreutter. He continued his studies at the Musikhochschule in Freiburg, Germany, and privately with Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Sir John Barbirolli, with whom he worked as assistant conductor.

After his return to Brazil in 1966, he established a solid reputation as a conductor, eventually working with all the major orchestras in the country, in addition to launching his career as arranger and composer of music for film and theater. In 1970, he worked with conductor Günther Schuller in the U.S., and returned for another period of study in Germany, during which he produced several arrangements of Brazilian popular music and composed more than 100 scores for German television movies.

Returning to Brazil in 1974, since then he has worked with several musical and cultural institutions in the country, in addition to contributing the soundtrack for hundreds of Brazilian movies, plays, and television programs. Among the institutions that he has directed are the Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro, the Orquestra Sinfônica do Teatro Municipal in Brasília, and the Festival de Inverno de Campos do Jordão in São Paulo.

He was the artistic adviser for the Rede Globo, the largest TV network in Brazil, and is the founder and director of the Amazonas Filarmônica, the resident orchestra at the Teatro Amazonas in Manaus.

He also made the orchestration of Festivals of the MPB of Rede Record.

He wrote his &quot;Belle Epoque en Sud-America&quot;, a Suite for Wind Quintet for the Bläserquintett of the Berlin Philharmonic, who have recorded the work and play it on tour. The piece consists of El Porsche Negro, a &quot;Tango&quot;; Traumreise nach Attersee, subtitled &quot;Vals Paulista&quot;; and Requinta Maluca, a &quot;Chorinho&quot;.

<text>Lake Victoria ferries are motor ships (earlier examples were steamboats) for ferry services carrying freight and/or vehicles and/or passengers between Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya on Lake Victoria. 

Operating ferries on Lake Victoria are mostly Ro-Pax ferries for the simultaneous transport of passengers, vehicles and goods. Some other ferries are dedicated train ferries, Ro-Ro ferries and cargo ships, as well as catamarans for passenger transport.

For most of the 20th century, Lake Victoria ferries were international ferries operating clockwise or counterclockwise around Lake Victoria. In the 21st century, ferries are mostly operating domestically within the borders of Kenya, Uganda or Tanzania and between mainland ports and Lake Victoria islands.

==Ports and port infrastructure==

The main ports on the lake are in Kisumu in Kenya; Mwanza, Musoma, Bukoba in Tanzania; Entebbe, Port Bell and Jinja in Uganda. Many smaller Lake Victoria ports are also in use, the number of ports served by ferries in Tanzania alone reaches 30.

The four ports of Kisumu, Port Bell, Musoma and Mwanza allow dedicated train ferries to dock at railway ferry wharves with jetties for direct rail track access to the ferries. The track gauge for the transported railway wagons is . In 2018, two of the railway wharves, at Port Bell and Mwanza, were in use. The train ferries connect the Uganda Railway at Port Bell with the Tanzanian Central Line at Mwanza. The Central Line is linked to the Tanzanian Indian Ocean port of Dar es Salaam to transport freight to and from world markets. The rail jetties at Kisumu and Musoma connect to railyards in the port areas, but these are rarely used as there are no operational railways in their hinterlands. Typical journey times were 13 hours between Port Bell and Kisumu, and 19 hours between Port Bell and Mwanza.

The most important Lake Victoria port is Mwanza not only because of the port infrastructure, rail and road access to the Indian Ocean but also because of major facilities for ferry operation, service and construction. Dedicated dry docks for ferry repairs exist in or near Mwanza, Kisumu and Port Bell, but only those in Mwanza are consistently used. Much industry in the region has moved to Mwanza.

==Ferries History==
The first ferry on Lake Victoria started operation in 1900s during the British colonial era, from the port of Kisumu. The original steamboats were later replaced by motor ships, some of which still operate on the lake. Almost all ferries (trains, cargo, passenger) in operation at the end of the 20th century were decades old. In 2018, most of them were still in operation. Newer 21st century-built ferries made up the majority of all ferries on Lake Victoria as of 2018. The number of ferries known to be in commercial operation in 2018 was about thirty in Tanzania, five in Uganda, and six in Kenya. 

The largest ferries for the transport of cargo on Lake Victoria are the train ferries , , and engaged in international services between Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. Each of them is able to transport 1180 tonnes of goods or 22 long rail waggons in four lanes (four tracks). In 2018, &quot;Umoja&quot; and &quot;Kaawa&quot; were in use between Port Bell and Mwanza, but the two ferries &quot;Pemba&quot; and &quot;Uhuru&quot; were suspended. The largest passenger ship on Lake Victoria is MV &quot;Victoria&quot;, which can transport up to 1200 passengers. These five vessels are between 30-60 years old and state-owned.

New Ro-Pax and Ro-Ro multipurpose ferries have continued to come into operation in recent years, built and assembled in Mwanza in Tanzania. These ferries have increased in size and capacity over the years, with the newest additions coming close to the older large train ferries. Two new Tanzanian state-owned Ro-Pax ferries, &quot;Misungwi&quot; (2016) and &quot;Mwanza&quot; (2018), can each transport up to 1000 passengers including up to 36 cars or up to 250 tonnes of cargo. The largest privately-owned ferry on Lake Victoria is a new Tanzanian Ro-Pax ferry from 2016, the &quot;Nyehunge II&quot; with a transport capacity of 284 tonnes of goods or 40 cars and 500 passengers. 

Apart from the motor vessels listed below, two steam ships more than 100 years old are reported to be still present on Lake Victoria in 2018, both in private hands: and , though &quot;Nyanza&quot; is suspended from operation in 2018.
The 20th century ferries have almost entirely been designed and built outside Africa, mostly in the UK and Germany but were assembled at Lake Victoria from pre-assembled parts. Most of the ferries delivered to several operators around Lake Victoria in the 21st century however have been designed and built in Tanzania through construction firms with dockyards and floating dry docks located at Mwanza port. Most new ro-ro ferries on Lake Victoria have been built by local &quot;Songoro Marine Transport Ltd&quot;, a company with construction services in Mwanza. Outside Mwanza, a new Kenyan company based in Kisumu, &quot;Globology Ltd&quot;, is planning to build and to operate up to 15 passenger-only catamaran passenger ferries until 2020.

== Ferry history ==

===Uganda Railway steamers===
The original ships serving the Uganda Railway were built in the United Kingdom as &quot;knock down&quot; ships; that is, they were bolted together, all the parts marked with numbers, disassembled into thousands of parts, transported in kit form by sea to Mombasa and by railway to Kisumu and reassembled.

 was built for the Imperial British East Africa Company in 1890 by Bow, McLachlan and Company at Paisley in Scotland but not launched at Kisumu until 1900. In the First World War, she was armed as a gunboat. In 1929, she was withdrawn from service, taken into deep water and scuttled.

The sister ships SS &quot;Winifred&quot; and SS &quot;Sybil&quot; were built by Bow, McLachlan &amp; Co in 1901. &quot;Winifred&quot; was launched on the lake in 1902 followed by &quot;Sybil&quot; in 1903. In the First World War East African Campaign, they were armed as gunboats. In 1914, &quot;Sybil&quot; was beached after striking a rock but she was refloated in 1915 and refitted and returned to service in 1916. In 1924, &quot;Sybil&quot; was converted into a lighter. &quot;Winifred&quot; was purposely sunk in 1936 to form a breakwater off Luamba Island. Her remains were scrapped in 1954. In the 1950s, &quot;Sybil&quot; sank at her moorings but she was raised, restored as a passenger and cargo vessel, and in 1956 re-entered service. In 1967, &quot;Sybil&quot; was purposely sunk at Kisumu to form a breakwater.

 was built by Bow, McLachlan &amp; Co in 1905. She served on the lake from 1907 to 1935. In 1936 she was purposely sunk at Bukakata to form a breakwater.

SS &quot;Nyanza&quot; is a cargo steamer built by Bow, McLachlan &amp; Co in 1907. She was reported to be laid up as of 2007.

 is a tugboat built by Bow, McLachlan &amp; Co in 1912 and launched at Kisumu in 1913. During the First World War, she served as a gunboat. In about 1984, she was laid up at Kisumu and later was used as an accommodation vessel. She later sank alongside, but in 2005 was raised. Her purchasers intended to lengthen and re-engine her for use as a tanker.

The sister ships and were built by Bow, McLachlan &amp; Co in 1913 and launched on the lake in 1914 and 1915, respectively. They were troop ships during the First World War East African Campaign and passed into civilian service after the Armistice. EAR&amp;H withdrew &quot;Rusinga&quot; for scrap in 1966, but she passed into private ownership and in 2005 was still in service. &quot;Usoga&quot; was laid up in 1975, sank at her moorings at Kisumu in the 1990s, and as of 2006 her remains were still there.

 and were steamers built by Bow, McLachlan &amp; Co in 1925. In the 1980s, &quot;Buvuma&quot; was laid up and sank at her jetty. &quot;Buganda&quot; later became additional accommodation at the Mwanza&#x27;s Hotel Tilapia, where she remains.

===East African Railways and Harbours motor vessels===
RMS &quot;Victoria&quot; was built in 1959 by Yarrow Shipbuilders at Scotstoun and reassembled for the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation (EAR&amp;H) ship at Kisumu in 1961. When the ship was commissioned, Queen Elizabeth II granted her the &quot;Royal Mail Ship&quot; designation: the only EAR&amp;H ship to receive this distinction. However, since Kenya&#x27;s independence from the UK, she has operated as MV &quot;Victoria&quot;.

The train ferries and are sister ships built by Yarrow in 1965. Kenya operated &quot;Uhuru&quot;, but she has been suspended from service since 2007.

By 1970, the East African Railways and Harbours Corporation operated regular sailings clockwise around the lake from Kisumu, using rail ferries that carried rail wagons loaded directly from rail tracks extended on the jetties at Kisumu, Port Bell and Mwanza. The rail network linked to the Indian Ocean ports of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam which allowed countries of the African interior such as Uganda and Rwanda to transport freight to and from world markets. Typical journey times were 13 hours between Port Bell in Uganda and Kisumu in Kenya, and 19 hours between Port Bell and Mwanza in Tanzania.

In 1977 EARH was dissolved and its assets divided between Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. &quot;Uhuru&quot; was transferred to the new Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) and &quot;Umoja&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot; to the new Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC). In 1978, the new Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) purchased three train ferries from Belgium, MV &quot;Pemba&quot;, MV &quot;Kaawa&quot; and MV &quot;Kabalega&quot;. However their production was interrupted by the war between Uganda and Tanzania that broke out in October 1978 and ended in April 1979. The ferries were assembled after the war at Port Bell and launched in 1983. TRC&#x27;s Marine Division introduced the ferry in about 1979 and the passenger and cargo ship in 1988.

In 1997, the Marine Division of TRC became a separate company, the Marine Services Company Limited, whose fleet includes &quot;Serengeti&quot;, &quot;Umoja&quot;, and &quot;Victoria&quot;.

===21st century vessels and operations===
Early in the 21st century, new Lake Victoria ro-ro ferries were constructed at Mwanza port in Tanzania, in particular through the family-owned and local &quot;Songoro Marine Transport Ltd&quot; in Tanzania. This added some dynamics to the ferry services sector on Lake Victoria and allowed several private companies to own and/or to operate new ferries, for example the Nyehunge ferries by Mohammed Seif, the owner of &quot;Nyehunge IT Support Ltd&quot;. In 2005, Tanzania founded a new state-owned enterprise, Tanzania Electrical, Mechanical and Electronics Services Agency (TEMESA), which received more than a dozen new and locally built and state-owned ro-ro ferries on Lake Victoria to operate them. 

Also in 2005, the private Rift Valley Railways Consortium (RVR) was selected by the two parastatal railway corporations in Kenya (KRC) and Uganda (URC) to operate their joint railway network from 2006 on. RVR also took over the three remaining Lake Victoria train ferries of Uganda and Kenya (&quot;Kabalega&quot; sank in 2005), &quot;Pemba&quot;, &quot;Uhuru&quot; and &quot;Kaawa&quot;. RVR suspended &quot;Pemba&quot; and &quot;Kaawa&quot; from service indefinitely and also stopped &quot;Uhuru&quot; from all operations in 2007 after the railway branch line of the Uganda Railway between Kisumu and Nakuru dropped out of operations due to an aging railway infrastructure. The Lake Victoria railheads in Port Bell, Jinja and Kisumu, then also operated by RVR, went out of operation. The remaining Tanzanian train ferry, MV &quot;Umoja&quot; could only serve Tanzanian rail jetties and became almost suspended as well and was used for special purposes only. Except from the Tanzanian ferry business, which started to flourish due to the new ferries built and put into operation, the Ugandan and Kenyan ferry business on Lake Victoria appeared to be dilapidated. 

In May 2008, the &quot;Daily Monitor&quot; stated that it expected the Ugandan government to announce in that year&#x27;s budget speech a government allocation of USh14 billion to buy a new train ferry to replace &quot;Kabalega&quot;. However, in September 2009, the Uganda Radio Network said the Ugandan government was unlikely to replace &quot;Kabalega&quot; soon. Instead, the Minister of Works proposed to improve port facilities at Jinja and Port Bell and let private operators run railway car floats with greater capacity than the ferries. The minister stated that &quot;Kaawa&quot; and &quot;Pemba&quot; would be reconditioned and returned to service and that private businesses had expressed an interest in raising &quot;Kabalega&quot; and restoring her to use as a private concession. In October 2009, the Ugandan government reiterated that it would recondition the &quot;Pemba&quot; and &quot;Kaawa&quot; and return them to service in 2010 and 2011 respectively. However, except words, no activities followed the announcements.

In 2010, new international passenger ferry services based on catamarans were to be launched. A US based company, Earthwise Ventures, announced that it would bring a fleet of fast ferries to Lake Victoria to connect major ports on the lake. Later on, the private Earthwise Ferries Ltd with branches in Tanzania and Uganda started to operate the first catamaran passenger ferry on Lake Victoria in 2012, the MV &quot;Amani&quot; at Port Bell in Uganda, followed by a sister ship in 2018, the &quot;Bluebird&quot; at Mwanza port in Tanzania. Also in 2010, a Scottish investor, Malcolm Ormiston, founded &quot;Globology Ltd&quot; in Kisumu, Kenya to build and to operate smaller catamaran passenger ferries to operate on Lake Victoria in Kenya and in Uganda under the brand name &quot;Waterbus East Africa&quot;. A first small and locally built catamaran, &quot;Captain Dan&quot; went into operation in 2010. In 2017, Globology intended to start to build 3-5 catamaran passenger ferries per year each with a capacity to transport 120 passengers.

As of April 2013, only Tanzania Railways&#x27; Central Line was operating freight rail services from Mwanza to Tabora, Dodoma and Dar es Salaam and therefore connecting the Lake Victoria freight services with the world market.

In 2017, the contract with RVR was cancelled in both Kenya and Uganda due to financial irregularities, both KRC and URC restarted the operations on their respective railway networks. URC also restarted the services at the railhead in Port Bell, the train ferry &quot;Kaawa&quot; was repaired and refurbished and put back into operation. In a similar manner, the train ferry &quot;Umoja&quot; on the Tanzanian side was repaired and refurbished. In June 2018, the EastAfrican reported that 1180-tonne &quot;Umoja&quot; began regular service again between Mwanza and Port Bell, plying the route 26 times every month. It is also expected that &quot;Kaawa&quot;, registered in Uganda, will join &quot;Umoja&quot; on the route. The Dar es Salaam to Kampala route costs US$65 per tonne, compared to US$90 per tonne on the Mombasa to Kampala route, as of June 2018. The Citizen (Tanzania), reported similar information.

==Incidents and accidents==

* On 21 May 1996, sank off Mwanza. She was carrying many more passengers than the 430 passengers she was certificated for, and 894 people were killed.
* In the early hours of 8 May 2005, &quot;Kabalega&quot; and &quot;Kaawa&quot; collided almost head-on. &quot;Kaawa&quot; damaged her bow and &quot;Kabalega&quot; suffered damage to her bow and flooding in two of her buoyancy tanks. &quot;Kaawa&quot; managed to return to port, but a few hours after the collision, &quot;Kabalega&quot; sank about southeast of the Ssese Islands. After the collision MV &quot;Pemba&quot; was also suspended from service.
* On 28 April 2006, capsized. She was a cargo and passenger ferry owned by the Dynamic Cotton Ginnery of Mwanza in Tanzania. She was carrying more than forty passengers, 28 of whom were feared dead.
* In February 2013, fire broke out on the MV &quot;Victoria&quot; whilst docked at Mwanza Port. It is believed that it was due to the welding works going on in one of the lower deck rooms and sparks of fire then passed on to the adjacent storage compartment. The situation was under control within two hours. The Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA) blamed the management for professional negligence.
* On 10 October 2014, MV &quot;Victoria&quot; experienced an engine failure midway on its journey from Bukoba to Mwanza.
* On 20 September 2018, at least 228 people died when the overloaded motor ferry MV &quot;Nyerere&quot;, carrying &quot;close to 270 passengers&quot;, capsized on Lake Victoria between Ukerewe Island and Ukara Island, Tanzania, from the pier on Ukara Island. About 41 people were rescued, with 32 sustaining critical injuries.

<text>The Karbovanets (, plural: карбованці, &quot;karbovantsi&quot; for 2–4, or карбованців, &quot;karbovantsiv&quot; for 5 or more), also colloquially known as kupon (, plural: купони, &quot;kupony&quot;) or coupon from the banknote printing, is a former unit of currency in Ukraine in three separate periods of the 20th century. It is also a predecessor currency of today&#x27;s Ukrainian hryvnia. The karbovanets was subdivided into one hundred &quot;kopiykas&quot;, but no denominations in kopiykas were ever issued, owing to inflation.

In the ISO 4217 standard, the official name is listed as either misspelled as &quot;karbovanet&quot; or correctly spelled as &quot;karbovanets&quot; likewise to the English version of the National Bank of Ukraine&#x27;s website refers to it as &quot;Karbovanets&quot;. The ISO 4217 standard code for the currency is UAK.

==History==

===First karbovanets (1917–1920)===

====Ukrainian Central Rada (1917–1918)====
In March 1917 in Kyiv, some political parties formed the Central Rada, which proclaimed on 20 November 1917, the foundation of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. On 19 December of the same year, a temporary law about the issue of state banknotes by the UPR was adopted. According to this law: &quot;Banknotes must be issued in karbovanets&quot; (). Each karbovanets contained 17.424 parts of pure gold and was divided into two &quot;hryvnias&quot; () or 200 shahs ().

The etymology of the name &quot;karbovanets&quot; is debatable: by one supposition, it originated in Ukraine from the ancient primitive way to carve (&quot;karbuvaty&quot;, ) numbers of calculations on a rod, and by another supposition, from the carving (incision) on a rim of a metal rouble.

On 5 January 1918, the first Ukrainian banknote with a value of 100 karbovantsiv was issued. The trident depicted on the banknote was proclaimed as a National Emblem of the UPR on 25 February 1918. On all of the issued banknotes, it stated only one series, &quot;AД&quot; and only one number, 185.

On 20 September 1918, the Central Rada proclaimed the issue of banknotes of the State Treasure in denominations of 5, 10, 25, and 50 karbovantsiv to be valid until 1 March 1924. On 6 April, the 25-karbovantsiv banknotes and 50 karbovantsiv banknotes later appeared, but the 5- and 10-karbovantsiv banknotes were not released. This series of banknotes was issued without designation of series and number. In subsequent issues, the series indicated the place of printing: AK (Kyiv) and AO (Odesa). After the occupation of Odesa by military units of Denikin&#x27;s Army in 1919, the printing house of Odesa continued printing banknotes of 50 karbovantsiv. The Ukrainian Government proclaimed money issued by the Denikinists to be false (series AO, numbers 210 and above).

In 1920, the Government of Ukraine printed some dozens of millions of banknotes for temporary use by the Revolutionary Committee in Western Ukraine. This issue of series AO had numbers from 236 to 250. The next release by the Central Rada (Parliament of Ukraine) was issued on 19 April 1918 and included denominations of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 shahs. The term &quot;shah&quot; is borrowed by the Central Rada from the ancient name of small coins (change) from as long ago as the 16th century. Shahs were printed in Kyiv in sheets of 100, perforated in order to simplify tearing off separate banknotes. Shahs were in circulation until March 1919, when they were abolished by the Soviets. There are many existing banknotes of this value.

====Ukrainian State Government (1918)====

The Congress of Free Husbandmen on 29 April 1918 (with the great support of Austro-German occupants), elected tsarist general Pavlo Skoropadskyi as Hetman of Ukraine. He proclaimed the overthrow of the Central Rada government and the foundation of the Ukrainian State.

In Skoropadskyi&#x27;s time, the so-called &quot;paper hryvnias&quot; were introduced in commerce. They were ordered by the Central Rada from Germany.

On 5 August 1918, the first banknote that appeared in commerce was the 3.6% state bond with the name &quot;Bank-note of the State Treasure&quot;. State bonds were printed with eight coupons, four coupons on each side.

On 17 October 1918, the Hetman&#x27;s government received from Germany another supply of banknotes with values of 2, 10, and 100 hryvnias, as ordered by the Central Rada. A bit later, banknotes of 1000 and 2000 were received. They bore the abbreviation of the Ukrainian State (УД, ), the official name of Ukraine during the Hetman&#x27;s time. These hryvnias were issued on 17 October 1918, 59 days before the Hetman&#x27;s overthrow.

==== Ukrainian Directorate (1918–1920) ====
The defeat of Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I also resulted in the breakup of Ukraine&#x27;s occupation regime (Hetman Skoropadsky&#x27;s government). On the night of 14 November 1918 in Bila Tserkva, the government of the Ukrainian Directorate was formed. Within a month, military forces of the Directorate occupied Kyiv. On 16 January 1919, the Government of the Directorate declared war on Soviet Russia. This action required issuing enormous sums of money. In Kyiv, the Directorate used reserves of banknotes which were issued previously by the Central Rada&#x27;s governments.

The military campaign of the Directorate turned out to be unsuccessful, and the offensive of the Red Army forced the Directorate to leave Kyiv and to settle in Vinnytsia (5 February 1919). There, the Directorate used 3.6% state bonds for their purchasing power. Beginning in March 1919, a series of banknotes (5 hryvnias) was issued. 5-hryvnia banknotes were printed on grey paper and contained an error in their text: &quot;гривна&quot; instead of &quot;гривень&quot;. Some of the banknotes entered circulation. The next bastion for the embattled Directorate was Kamanets-Podilsk, where it held out for almost a year and issued a few more banknotes.

In August 1919, banknotes were printed with the value of 100, 250, and 1000 karbovantsiv. The 1000 karbovantsiv banknote was issued in Kyiv and entered circulation on 13 November 1918. Printing was continued by the Directorate government in October 1919 at Kam&#x27;yanets&#x27;-Podil&#x27;s&#x27;kyi and in 1920 at Warsaw. Later, 10 karbovantsiv (August 1919) and 25 karbovantsiv (October 1919) were put into use. The design of the 10 karbovantsiv (tank notes) was prepared in the Hetman&#x27;s period, and their obverse had the large letters УД which designated the Ukrainian state (). The last banknotes of the Directorate were prepared in Austria. The series contained banknotes of 50 and 1000 hryvnias. But they were never issued (only some specimen copies are known). On 20 November 1920, the Directorial Government was disbanded by S.V. Petlyura&#x27;s edict, and its provision of currency ended.

====Ukrainian SSR (1919–1920)====
At the beginning of 1919 in Kharkiv, by Lenin&#x27;s direction, Russia financed the pro-Soviet government. However, a period of unprecedented inflation was triggered by the Civil War and resulted in a sharp deficit of circulating money, especially banknotes. The People&#x27;s Commissar of Finance of the USSR, with the consent of the RSFSR government, decided to use the 10 karbovanets banknotes of the Directorate. This note&#x27;s artwork (without series and numbers) was captured by the Red Army on 5 February 1919 during the takeover of Kyiv from the Petlyurian troops. The Soviet banknote differed from the Directorate&#x27;s in paper, ink, watermarks, and the location of their series and numbers.

One more banknote of 50 karbovantsiv with Soviet symbols was printed. On 1 June 1919, Ukraine united with the Soviet governments of Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Belarus in a common front, and only one monetary unit was legitimized – the ruble of the USSR. The 50-karbovantsiv banknote is known only by some specimen copies.

===Second karbovanets (1942–1945)===
During the Nazi occupation of Ukraine in World War II, the German occupying government (Reichskommissariat Ukraine) issued banknotes denominated in karbovanets (&quot;karbowanez&quot; in German). The karbovanets replaced the Soviet ruble at par and was in circulation between 1942 and 1945. It was pegged to the Reichsmark at a rate of 10 karbovantsiv = 1 Reichsmark.
===Third Karbovanets (1992–1996)===

In November 1990, with the collapse of the Soviet command economy, the Ukrainian SSR introduced one-time coupons, which were distributed to Ukrainian residents. The coupons were created in addition to Rubles in order to buy groceries and living essentials. On 10 January 1992, the karbovanets replaced Rubles at par, with the ISO 4217 code being codice_1.

The karbovanets, which suffered from hyperinflation, was replaced by the hryvnia in 1996, at a rate of 100,000 karbovantsiv to 1 hryvnia. The hryvnia was introduced in 1996, and from 2 September until 16 September both the karbovanets and hryvnia were in circulation. After 16 September 1996, the use of the karbovanets as a national currency was discontinued.

==Banknotes==

===First Karbovanets===
In 1917, the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic introduced 100 karbovantsiv notes. These were followed in 1918 by State Treasury notes for 25 and 50 karbovantsiv. That year also saw the issue of postage stamp currency denominated in shah and various bonds, together with state credit notes in denominations of 2, 10, 100, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 hryven. The Directorate issued notes for 100, 250 and 100 karbovanets in 1918, followed by 10 and 25 karbovanets in 1919. State notes for 5, 50, and 1,000 hryven were issued in 1920. 1 Karbovanet was worth 2 hryvni or 200 shah.
===Second karbovanets===
Banknotes were introduced in June 1942 in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 karbovantsiv. The banknotes were in dark colour, carrying nearly all inscriptions in German and a warning in both German and Ukrainian stating &quot;falsification of banknotes is punished by imprisoning&quot;. The obverse of the notes all featured a portrait, including children, a peasant, a miner, a seaman, and a chemist. The Nazi Reichsadler also appeared.

===Third karbovanets===
In 1991, notes were introduced in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 karbovantsiv (also called &quot;kupons&quot; or &quot;coupons&quot;). All 1991 banknotes were of the same design, picturing Lybid from the monument of the founders of Kyiv on the obverse and the Sophia Cathedral on the reverse. The banknotes did not carry individual serial numbers or signatures. In 1992, banknotes for 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 karbovantsiv were issued, which carried serial numbers.

In 1993, banknotes for 2000 and 5000 karbovantsiv were issued. Having similar designs as the 1992 banknotes, they were the first to carry the coat of arms of Ukraine. In the same year, notes for 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, and 100,000 karbovantsiv were also introduced into circulation, which were bigger in size and pictured the Volodymyr Monument on the obverse and the Kyiv Opera on the reverse. Subsequently, banknotes for 200,000 and 500,000 karbovantsiv were introduced in 1994, followed by the 1,000,000 karbovantsiv banknote in 1995, which pictured the Taras Shevchenko Monument in Kyiv.

=== Commemorative and anniversary coins ===
Between 1995 and 1996, the National Bank of Ukraine issued commemorative and jubilee coins as proofs with a denomination of: 200,000 karbovantsiv (12 types, made of cupronickel); 1,000,000 karbovantsiv (4 types, made of silver); 2,000,000 karbovantsiv (5 types, made of silver). Coins were dedicated to the events of the historical past and modern life on various topics: history, religion, sports, culture, etc.

<text>Fairmont State University is a public university in Fairmont, West Virginia.

==History==
Fairmont State University’s roots reach back to the formation of public education in the state of West Virginia. The first private normal school in West Virginia was established to train teachers in Fairmont in 1865 by John N. Boyd, the school’s first principal. It was known as the West Virginia Normal School at Fairmont.

On February 27, 1867, it was purchased by the State from the Regency of the West Virginia Normal School (formed as a joint stock company in 1866) and became a branch of the State Normal School of Marshall College. From 1867 to 1892 the school was known variously as Fairmont Normal School, the Fairmont Branch of the West Virginia Normal School, the Branch of the West Virginia Normal School at Fairmont, a branch of the West Virginia State Normal School of Marshall College, but most commonly as Fairmont State Normal School (FSNS). By 1892 the designation of &quot;branch&quot; had fallen into disuse.

In 1893, the school moved into a new building at Second Street and Fairmont Avenue and, in 1917, to its current location in the building now known as Hardway Hall, in honor of former president Wendell G. Hardway, which sits on a hill overlooking Locust Avenue.

Hardway Hall, originally known as Fairmont Normal School Administration Building, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

In 1923, Fairmont State Normal School first offered a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree program in education, making the school a college. It was renamed Fairmont State Teachers College in 1931 and Fairmont State College in 1943. On April 7, 2004, Governor Bob Wise signed legislation changing its name to Fairmont State University.

Fairmont State offers more than 80 baccalaureate degrees in business, computer science, education, engineering and technology, fine arts, liberal arts, national security and intelligence, political science, mathematics, and nursing and allied health administration with graduate programs in architecture, education, teaching, business, and criminal justice.

==Community and technical college==
In 1974, a community college component was founded. This became independently accredited as Fairmont State Community and Technical College in 2003. In 2006, Fairmont State was given direction by the State of West Virginia to split with the community and technical college, which then became known as Pierpont Community and Technical College. For some time both institutions still operated on the Fairmont campus, but since 2008, they are recognized as independent institutions and offer completely separate degree programs; Pierpont focuses more on technical associate&#x27;s programs, while Fairmont State&#x27;s main focus is on baccalaureate degrees and master&#x27;s programs.

After a March 2021 Memorandum of Understanding, the two schools became independent of one another whereby Pierpont transitioned off of the Fairmont campus into a new building near the NASA complex in South Fairmont,

==Athletics==

Fairmont State&#x27;s athletic teams, known as the &quot;Falcons&quot; (alternately as &quot;Fighting Falcons&quot;, or &quot;Lady Falcons&quot; for women&#x27;s teams), compete in the Mountain East Conference (MEC) in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division II and field teams in 17 sports including football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, wrestling, women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, acrobatics and tumbling, baseball, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country.

The Fighting Falcons football team finished the 2016 season with a 10–2 record, clinching an NCAA playoff berth. In 2017, they finished the season 8–3 and 2nd in the MEC.

In 2017, the men&#x27;s basketball team was ranked #3 in the final NABC Coaches Poll. In post-season play, the Falcons captured the NCAA Atlantic Region title and earned the top seed in the NCAA Elite Eight tournament eventually losing to Northwest Missouri State in the tournament final on March 25, 2017 by a score of 71–61.

==The National Security Lab==
The Open Source Intelligence Exchange (OSIX) organization was created in 2012 and serves as Fairmont State&#x27;s applied research lab under the National Security and Intelligence program. OSIX uses open source and social media intelligence to determine real-world active threats. Professor David Abruzzino, who came to Fairmont State after retiring from work with the CIA, was the OSIX program director and faculty mentor from 2010 until 2017.

<doc id="1239107" wikidata="Q2257657" url="?curid=1239107" title="Glass float">
<text>Glass floats were used by fishermen in many parts of the world to keep their fishing nets, as well as longlines or droplines, afloat.

Large groups of fishnets strung together, sometimes long, were set adrift in the ocean and supported near the surface by hollow glass balls or cylinders containing air to give them buoyancy. These glass floats are no longer used by fishermen, but many of them are still afloat in the world&#x27;s oceans, primarily the Pacific. They have become a popular collectors&#x27; item for beachcombers and decorators. Replicas are now manufactured.

== History ==

Norway, around 1840, was the first country to produce and use glass floats. The earliest mention of these &quot;modern&quot; glass fishing floats is in the production registry for Hadeland Glassverk in Norway in 1842. The registry shows that this was a new type of production. Christopher Faye, a Norwegian merchant from Bergen, is credited with their invention. The glass float was developed through cooperation with one of the owners of the Hadeland Glassverk, Chr. Berg. Many of them can still be found in local boathouses. The earliest evidence of glass floats being used by fishermen comes from Norway in 1844 where glass floats were on gill nets in the great cod fisheries in Lofoten. 

By the 1940s, glass had replaced wood or cork throughout much of Europe, Russia, North America, and Japan. Japan started using the glass floats as early as 1910. Today, most of the remaining glass floats originated in Japan because it had a large deep sea fishing industry which made extensive use of the floats; some made by Taiwan, Korea and China. In Japanese, the floats are variably known as or .

Glass floats have since been replaced by aluminum, plastic, or Styrofoam.

== Manufacturing ==

The earliest floats, including most Japanese glass fishing floats, were handmade by a glassblower. Recycled glass, especially old sake bottles in Japan, was typically used and air bubbles/imperfections in the glass are a result of the rapid recycling process. After being blown, floats were removed from the blowpipe and sealed with a &#x27;button&#x27; of melted glass before being placed in a cooling oven. This sealing button is sometimes mistakenly identified as a pontil mark; however, no pontil (or punty) was used in the process of blowing glass floats. While floats were still hot and soft, marks were often embossed on or near the sealing button to identify the float for trademark. These marks sometimes included kanji symbols.

A later manufacturing method used wooden molds to speed up the float-making process. Glass floats were blown into a mold to more easily achieve a uniform size and shape. Seams on the outside of floats are a result of this process. Sometimes knife markings where the wooden molds were carved are also visible on the surface of the glass.

== Dispersion ==
Today most of the glass floats remaining in the ocean are stuck in a circular pattern of ocean currents in the North Pacific. Off the east coast of Taiwan, the Kuroshio Current starts as a northern branch of the western-flowing North Equatorial Current. It flows past Japan and meets the arctic waters of the Oyashio Current. At this junction, the North Pacific Current (or Drift) is formed which travels east across the Pacific before slowing down in the Gulf of Alaska. As it turns south, the California Current pushes the water into the North Equatorial Current once again, and the cycle continues. Although the number of glass floats is decreasing steadily, many floats are still drifting on these ocean currents. Occasionally storms or certain tidal conditions will break some floats from this circular pattern and bring them ashore. They most often end up on the beaches of the Western United States - especially Alaska, Washington, or Oregon - Taiwan, or Canada. However, many floats have been found on beaches and along coral reefs on Pacific islands, most notably the windward side of Guam. It is estimated that floats must be a minimum of 7-10 years old before washing up on beaches in Alaska. Most floats that wash up, however, would have been afloat for 10 years. A small number of floats are also trapped in the Arctic ice pack where there is movement over the North Pole and into the Atlantic Ocean.

== Appearance ==

Once a float lands on a beach, it may roll in the surf and become etched by sand. Many glass floats show distinctive wear patterns from the corrosive forces of sand, sun, and salt water. When old netting breaks off of a float, its pattern often remains on the surface of the glass where the glass was protected under the netting. Other floats have small amounts of water trapped inside of them. This water apparently enters the floats through microscopic imperfections in the glass while the floats are suspended in Arctic ice or held under water by netting.

To accommodate different fishing styles and nets, the Japanese experimented with different sizes and shapes of floats, ranging from 2 to in diameter. Most were rough spheres, but some were cylindrical or &quot;rolling pin&quot; shaped.

Most floats are shades of green because that is the color of glass from recycled sake bottles. However, clear, amber, aquamarine, amethyst, blue and other colors were also produced. The most prized and rare color is a red or cranberry hue. These were expensive to make because gold was used to produce cranberry glass. Other brilliant tones such as emerald green, cobalt blue, purple, yellow and orange were primarily made in the 1920s and 30s. The majority of the colored floats available for sale today are replicas.

<text>Richard Tucker (August 28, 1913January 8, 1975) was an American operatic tenor and cantor. Long associated with the Metropolitan Opera, Tucker&#x27;s career was primarily centered in the United States.

== Early life ==
Tucker was born Rivn (Rubin) Ticker in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest of five surviving children of Bessarabian Jewish parents who immigrated to the US in 1911. His father, Ysruel (Sam) Ticker, and mother Fanya-Tsipa (Fanny) Ticker resisted using the anglicized &quot;Tucker&quot; their children adopted, but by the time their youngest son entered first grade, he was registered under the surname Tucker. His musical aptitude was discovered early, and was nurtured under the tutelage of Samuel Weisser at the Tifereth Israel synagogue in Lower Manhattan. As a teenager, Tucker&#x27;s interests alternated between athletics, at which he excelled during his school years, and singing for weddings and bar mitzvahs as a cantorial student. Eventually, he progressed from a part-time cantor at Temple Emanuel in Passaic, New Jersey, to full-time cantorships at Temple Adath Israel in the Bronx and, in June 1943, at the large and prestigious Brooklyn Jewish Center. Until then, Tucker&#x27;s income derived mainly from his weekly commissions as a salesman for the Reliable Silk Company in Manhattan&#x27;s garment district.

On February 11, 1936, Tucker married Sara Perelmuth, the youngest child (and only daughter) of Levi and Anna Perelmuth, proprietors of the Grand Mansion, a kosher banquet hall in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. At the time of Tucker&#x27;s wedding to their daughter, the Perelmuths&#x27; musically gifted eldest son, Yakob, had progressed from a part-time jazz violinist and lyric tenor vocalist to a national radio star who had already set his sights on an operatic career. Under the management of Sol Hurok, the eldest of the Perelmuth offspring, now renamed Jan Peerce, reached his goal when the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera Company, Edward Johnson, offered him a contract after an impressive audition. When Peerce made his much-acclaimed debut at the Met on November 29, 1941, his sister and her new husband were living with Peerce&#x27;s parents.

== Operatic career ==
Although Peerce remained skeptical of Tucker&#x27;s singing talent and did not overtly encourage his operatic ambitions (causing an unfortunate rift between the two brothers-in-law and their families, which apparently never completely healed), Peerce did play a role in introducing Tucker to conductor and arranger Zavel Zilberts, who coached Tucker until he came to the attention of Paul Althouse, a notable tenor whose operatic career had begun during Enrico Caruso&#x27;s reigning years at the Met. Althouse became Tucker&#x27;s only teacher. Contrary to his teacher&#x27;s advice, Tucker entered the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s &quot;Auditions of the Air&quot; in 1943, but did not win. When Met general manager Edward Johnson came unannounced to the Brooklyn Jewish Center to hear Tucker sing, however, Johnson offered the tenor another audition and soon awarded him a contract. On January 25, 1945, under the baton of Emil Cooper, Tucker made his debut as Enzo Grimaldo in &quot;La Gioconda&quot;. This debut, one of the most successful in the annals of the Met, heralded Tucker&#x27;s 30-year career as the leading American tenor of the Met&#x27;s postwar era.
Two years after his Metropolitan debut, Tucker was invited to reprise his success in &quot;La Gioconda&quot; at the amphitheater in Verona, Italy, for which the retired tenor and Verona native, Giovanni Zenatello, had also engaged the young Maria Callas. Two years later, in 1949, Tucker&#x27;s rapidly ascending career was confirmed when Arturo Toscanini engaged Tucker to sing the role of Radames for the NBC broadcasts of a complete concert performance of &quot;Aida&quot; opposite Herva Nelli in the title role, an event heard and seen on radio and television, and eventually released on LP, CD, VHS, and DVD. This was one of the first complete opera performances ever broadcast on national television.

In the ensuing years, Tucker&#x27;s ample lyric voice evolved into a lirico-spinto voice of near-dramatic proportions. If his signature stylistic devices, especially his affection for Italianate sobs, were not always lauded by the critics, the distinctive timbre of his ringing voice, his unfailingly secure technique, impeccable diction, and native-sounding pronunciation were universally acclaimed in every role he undertook. “For me, Richard Tucker was, and always will be, an ‘Italian’ tenor,” Luciano Pavarotti wrote in the foreword to the authorized biography by James A. Drake. “Like Jussi Bjoerling, he proved that one does not have to be Italian-born in order to win the critics and public.” A profusion of legendary tenors including Jussi Björling, Giuseppe Di Stefano, Mario Del Monaco and, eventually, Jan Peerce) came and went during the years in which (Sir) Rudolf Bing led the Metropolitan. Tucker remained a dominant tenor and steadily took on new challenges. Although an unremarkable actor throughout most of his career, Tucker made a strong dramatic impression with veteran critics when he reconceived the role of Canio in &quot;Pagliacci&quot; under the direction of Franco Zeffirelli in January 1970. The tenor was nearly 60 years old at the time.

Before and after each Metropolitan Opera season, Tucker appeared on concert stages through the U.S. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Tucker frequently appeared in a series of well attended open-air concerts at Lewisohn Stadium in New York City, under the direction of Alfredo Antonini.

Throughout his opera career, Tucker maintained a Jewish identity. He kept a kosher home, and regularly officiated as a cantor on Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and other sacred events in the Jewish liturgical calendar, especially in Chicago. He oversaw the religious development of his three sons, Berel (Barry, born 1938); David N. Tucker, M.D. (born 1941); and Henry (born 1946). Their father arranged for them to sing with him on a popular television program hosted by Sam Levenson, 9 March 1952.

Tucker had a long-running contract with Columbia Records, and eventually recorded for RCA Victor as well. But, measured against the sheer length of his career, Tucker&#x27;s commercial recordings are proportionately sparse and inadequately convey the power and roundness of his voice, according to most of his artistic colleagues. However, his recordings with soprano Leontyne Price (especially in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and &quot;La forza del destino&quot;) invariably show him in fine ringing voice and with a convincing dramatic presence. He also made a famous recording of &quot;Aida&quot; with a colleague from his Verona debut, Maria Callas. He recorded the Verdi &quot;Requiem&quot; with George London. Many other commercial recordings, as well as private recordings of his concerts and broadcast performances, have been digitally remastered and are available in CD and online downloadable formats. A number of his national television appearances on &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; and &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot; were preserved in kinescope and videotape form, and have been reissued in VHS and DVD format. A complete video performance of the tenor&#x27;s portrayal of Canio in the Zeffirelli production of &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, which was to be paired with &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; featuring Tucker&#x27;s friend and tenor colleague Franco Corelli as Turiddu, was never telecast and has not been issued commercially, for legal reasons.

Although Tucker&#x27;s well-crafted public image was that of a competitive, overwhelmingly self-confident performer, his offstage demeanor was that of an inherently private but unfailingly considerate man, especially where fans and colleagues were concerned. Never prone to looking back upon his career, Tucker always lived in the moment and maintained a boyish outlook on life He also displayed a propensity for playing pranks on some of his fellow singers, often provoking a smile at some inappropriate moment in a performance. Once, during a broadcast of &quot;La forza del destino&quot; with baritone Robert Merrill, Tucker sneaked a nude photograph into a small trunk that Merrill opened onstage. In later years, Merrill described his tenor friend as &quot;an original, right out of the pages of a Damon Runyon story&quot;.

==Death==

On January 8, 1975, Tucker died of a sudden heart attack in his hotel room in Kalamazoo, Michigan while on tour with Robert Merrill in a national series of joint concerts. His funeral was held on January 10 on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House, the only singer ever to be so honored.

== Legacy ==
Shortly after his death, the Richard Tucker Music Foundation was established by his widow, sons, colleagues, and friends, &quot;to perpetuate the memory of America&#x27;s greatest tenor through projects in aid of gifted young singers.&quot; In the intervening decades, the Richard Tucker Foundation, whose annual televised concerts have been hosted by Luciano Pavarotti and others, has consistently awarded the largest vocal-music grants and scholarships. Recipients, the first of whom was Rockwell Blake, include sopranos Renée Fleming, Deborah Voigt, Isabel Leonard, tenors Richard Leech, Stephen Costello, James Valenti, Michael Fabbiano and other opera singers of international renown.

In tribute to his legacy at the Met, the city of New York designated the park adjacent to Lincoln Center as Richard Tucker Square.

<text>He Long (; March 22, 1896 – June 9, 1969) was a Chinese Communist revolutionary and a Marshal of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He was from a poor rural family in Hunan, and his family was not able to provide him with any formal education. He began his revolutionary career after avenging the death of his uncle, when he fled to become an outlaw and attracted a small personal army around him. Later his forces joined the Kuomintang, and he participated in the Northern Expedition.

He rebelled against the Kuomintang after Chiang Kai-shek began violently suppressing Communists, when he planned and led the unsuccessful Nanchang Uprising. After escaping, he organized a soviet in rural Hunan (and later Guizhou), but was forced to abandon his bases when pressured by Chiang&#x27;s Encirclement Campaigns. He joined the Long March in 1935, over a year after forces associated with Mao Zedong and Zhu De were forced to do so. He met with forces led by Zhang Guotao, but he disagreed with Zhang about the strategy of the Red Army and led his forces to join and support Mao.

After settling and establishing a headquarters in Shaanxi, He led guerrilla forces in Northwest China in both the Chinese Civil War and the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was generally successful in expanding areas of Communist control. He commanded a force of 170,000 troops forces by the end of 1945, when his force was placed under the command of Peng Dehuai and He became Peng&#x27;s second-in-command. He was placed in control of Southwest China in the late 1940s, and spent most of the 1950s in the Southwest administering the region in both civilian and military roles.

He held a number of civilian and military positions after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. In 1955, his contributions to the victory of the Chinese Communist Party were recognized when he was named one of the Ten Marshals, and he served as China&#x27;s vice premier. He did not support Mao Zedong&#x27;s attempts to purge Peng Dehuai in 1959 and attempted to rehabilitate Peng. After the Cultural Revolution was declared in 1966, he was one of the first leaders of the PLA to be purged. He died in 1969 when a glucose injection provided by his jailers complicated his untreated diabetes.

==Biography==

===Early life===

He Long was a member of the Tujia ethnic group. Born in the Sangzhi, Hunan, he and his siblings, including He Ying, grew up in a poor peasant household, despite his father being a minor Qing military officer. His father was a member of the Gelaohui (Elder Brother Society), a secret society dating back to the early Qing dynasty. A cowherd during his youth, he received no formal education. When He was 20 he killed a local government tax assessor who had killed his uncle for defaulting on his taxes. He then fled and became an outlaw, giving rise to the legend that he began his revolutionary career with just two kitchen knives. After beginning his life as an outlaw he gained a reputation as a &quot;Robin Hood-like figure&quot;. His signature weapon was a butcher knife.

Around 1918 He raised a volunteer revolutionary army that was aligned with a local Hunan warlord, and in 1920, his personal army joined the National Revolutionary Army. In 1923 He was promoted to command the Nationalist Twentieth Army. In 1925 He ran a school for training Kuomintang soldiers. While running this school, He became close with some of his students who were also Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members. During the 1926 Northern Expedition, He commanded the 1st Division, 9th Corps of the National Revolutionary Army. He served under Zhang Fakui during the Northern Expedition.

In late 1926 He joined the CCP. In 1927, after the collapse of Wang Jingwei&#x27;s leftist Kuomintang government in Wuhan and Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s suppression of communists, He left the Kuomintang and joined the Communists, commanding the 20th Corps, 1st Column of the Red Army. 

The uprising was held in an Anglican Church. Christian influences Chinese Culture, Hong Xiuquan. 

He and Zhu De planned and led the main force of the Nanchang Uprising in 1927. In the Nanchang Uprising He and Zhu led a combined force of 24,000 men and attempted to seize the city of Nanchang, but they were not able to secure it against the inevitable Kuomintang attempt to retake the city. The campaign suffered from logistical difficulties, and the communists suffered 50% casualties in the two months of fighting. Most of He&#x27;s soldiers who survived surrendered, deserted, and/or rejoined the KMT. Only 2,000 survivors eventually returned to fight for the Communists in 1928, when Zhu reformed his forces in Hunan.

After his forces were defeated, He fled to Lufeng, Guangdong. He spent some time in Hong Kong, but was later sent by the CCP to Shanghai, then to Wuhan. Chiang Kai-shek continuously tried to persuade him rejoin the Kuomintang, but failed.

===Communist guerrilla===

After the failure of the Nanchang Uprising, He turned down an offer by the CCP Central Committee to study in Russia and returned to Hunan, where he raised a new force in 1930. His force controlled a broad area of the countryside in the Hunan-Hubei border region, around the area of Lake Hong, and organized this area into a rural soviet. In mid-1932 Kuomintang forces targeted He&#x27;s soviet as part of the Fourth Encirclement Campaign. He&#x27;s forces abandoned their bases, moved southwest, and established a new base in northeast Guizhou in mid-1933.

In 1934 Ren Bishi joined He in Guizhou with his own surviving forces after also being forced to abandon his soviet in another Encirclement Campaign. Ren and He merged forces, with He becoming the military commander and Ren becoming the commissar. He joined the Long March in November 1935, over a year after forces led by Zhu De and Mao Zedong were forced to evacuate their own soviet in Jiangxi. He&#x27;s ability to resist the Kuomintang was partially due to his position on the periphery of Communist-controlled territory. While on the Long March He&#x27;s forces met Communist forces led by Zhang Guotao in June 1936, but both He and Ren disagreed with Zhang about the direction of the Long March, and He eventually led his forces into Shaanxi to join Mao Zedong by the end of 1936. In 1937 He settled his troops in northwestern Shaanxi and established a new headquarters there. Because the Second Army of the Chinese Red Army under He Long&#x27;s command was one of the few Communist forces to arrive in Yan&#x27;an mostly intact, his force was able to assume the responsibility of protecting the new capital after their arrival.

When the Red Army was reorganized into the Eighth Route Army in 1937, He was placed in command of the 120th Division. From late 1938 to 1940 He fought both the Japanese army and Kuomintang-affiliated guerrillas in Hubei. He&#x27;s responsibilities increased during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and in 1943 he was promoted to be the overall commander of Communist forces in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia. By the end of World War II He commanded a force of approximately 175,000 troops across northwestern China. He&#x27;s most notable subordinates included Zhang Zongxun, Xu Guangda, and Peng Shaohui.

He was successful in expanding Communist base areas throughout the period of World War II. Part of He&#x27;s success was due to the social confusion caused by Japan&#x27;s Ichi-Go offensive in the areas of China that Japanese operations effected. He was frequently able to expand Communist areas of operation by allying with local, independent guerrilla forces who were also fighting the Japanese. He&#x27;s experience fighting the Kuomintang and the Japanese led him to question Mao&#x27;s unconditional emphasis on the importance of ideological guerrilla warfare at the expense of conventional tactics and military organization.

In October 1945, one month after the Japanese surrender, the command of He&#x27;s forces was transferred to Peng Dehuai, which operated as the &quot;Northwest Field Army&quot;. He became Peng&#x27;s second-in-command, but spent most of the rest of the Chinese Civil War in central CCP headquarters, in and around Yan&#x27;an. After the Japanese surrender, in 1945, He was elected to the CCP Central Committee, and his influence rose within both the military and the communist political system. Near the end of the Chinese Civil War He was promoted to command the First Field Army, which was active in Southwest China. After the Communists won the civil war in 1949, He spent most of the 1950s in both civilian and military roles in the southwest.

===In the People&#x27;s Republic===

He&#x27;s military accomplishments were recognized when he was promoted to being one of the Ten Marshals in 1955, and he served in a number of civilian positions. He was made Vice Premier. He headed the National Sports Commission, and in that role facilitated sports exchanges with the Soviet Union and the eastern European countries. He was one of the most well-traveled members of the CCP elite, and led numerous delegations abroad, meeting with leaders of other Asian countries, the Soviet Union, and East Germany.

After Mao Zedong purged Peng Dehuai in 1959, Mao appointed He to the head of an office to investigate Peng&#x27;s past and find reasons to criticize Peng. He accepted the position but was sympathetic to Peng, and stalled for over a year before submitting his report. Mao&#x27;s prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao&#x27;s Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng. Peng was partially rehabilitated in 1965, but then purged again at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution 1966. He was accused of a mutiny in Feb 1964, after a Soviet Union trip with Zhou Enlai. The Soviet were unhappy, with China direction. Cultural revolution followed soon after, to purged communist and rightist leanings in China. 

Jiang Qing denounced He in December 1966 of being a &quot;rightist&quot; and of intra-CCP factionalism. Following Jiang&#x27;s accusations He and his supporters were branded an anti-CCP element and quickly purged. He&#x27;s persecutors singled him out by labeling him the &quot;biggest bandit&quot;. He was the second highest-ranking member of the Military Affairs Commission at the time that he was purged, and the method in which he and those close to him were purged set the pattern for multiple later purges of the PLA leadership throughout the Cultural Revolution.

After being purged, He was placed under indefinite house arrest for the last two and a half years of his life. He described the conditions of his imprisonment as a period of slow torture, in which his captors &quot;intended to destroy my health so that they can murder me without spilling my blood&quot;. During the years that he was imprisoned, his captors restricted his access to water, cut off his house&#x27;s heat during the winter, and refused him access to medicine to treat his diabetes. He died in 1969 after being hospitalized for the severe malnutrition that he developed while under house arrest. He died soon after being admitted to hospital, after a glucose injection complicated his chronic diabetes.

He was posthumously partially rehabilitated by Mao in 1974, then fully rehabilitated after Deng Xiaoping came to power in the late 1970s. A stadium in Changsha was named after him in 1987.

<text>Alice Mary Smith (married name Alice Mary Meadows White; 19 May 1839 – 4 December 1884) was an English composer. Her compositions included two symphonies and a large collection of choral works, both sacred and secular.

==Biography==

Smith was born in London, the third child of a relatively well-to-do family. She showed aptitude for music from her early years and took lessons privately from William Sterndale Bennett and George Alexander Macfarren, publishing her first song in 1857. In November 1867, the year of her marriage to a lawyer, Frederick Meadows White, she was elected Female Professional Associate of the Royal Philharmonic Society. In 1884 she was elected an honorary member of the Royal Academy of Music. The same year, after a period of illness in which she went abroad to try to recover, she died of typhoid fever in London and was buried in Highgate Cemetery.

==Works==
Smith was a prolific composer, writing for a diverse range of ensembles.

Among her chamber compositions are four piano quartets, three string quartets and a clarinet sonata (1870), perhaps the first British example, anticipating sonatas by Swinnerton Heap, Prout, Tovey and Stanford. Her orchestral compositions include six concert overtures and two symphonies. Her first symphony, in C minor, was written at the age of 24 and performed by the Musical Society of London in 1863; the second, in A minor, was written for the Alexandra Palace competition of 1876, but was never submitted.

Smith composed two large pieces for the stage: an operetta, &quot;Gisela of Rüdesheim&quot; for chorus, orchestra, and soloists which was performed in 1865 at the Fitzwilliam Music Society, Cambridge, and &quot;The Masque of Pandora&quot; (1875), for which the orchestration was never completed.

Smith&#x27;s oeuvre includes one of the largest collections of sacred choral music by a woman composer, and comprises six anthems, three canticles (and the beginning to a fourth), as well as a short Sacred Cantata &quot;Exile,&quot; based on episodes from Jean Racine&#x27;s &quot;Esther.&quot; Her anthems &quot;Whoso hath this world&#x27;s goods&quot; and &quot;By the waters of Babylon&quot; were performed in a liturgical context at St Andrew&#x27;s, Wells Street by Sir Joseph Barnby in February 1864, making them the first recorded instance of music by a woman composer to be used for the liturgies of the Church of England.

In 1880 she turned her attention towards writing large-scale cantatas, all published by Novello &amp; Co. These included &quot;Ode to the North-East Wind&quot; for chorus and orchestra, &quot;Ode to The Passions&quot; (1882), her longest work, performed at the Three Choirs Festival in Hereford in that year, and two cantatas for male voices in the last two years of her life. In her obituary, her husband claimed that she was working on a setting of the poem &quot;The Valley of Remorse&quot; by Louisa Sarah Bevington for chorus, soloists and orchestra; however, there is no manuscript to support this claim. Of her forty songs, her most popular work was the vocal duet &quot;O that we two were maying&quot;. Another, &quot;Lessons of the Gorses&quot; (setting Elizabeth Barrett Browning), was published in &quot;The Girl&#x27;s Own Paper&quot; in 1883.

Since 2010, Smith&#x27;s manuscripts are housed in the Royal Academy of Music Library. Two symphonies and two overtures are published by A-R Editions in editions by Ian Graham-Jones. The Symphony in A minor, Symphony in C minor and the Andante for clarinet and orchestra (taken from the Clarinet Sonata) have been recorded by Howard Shelley and the London Mozart Players for Chandos. Leonard Sanderman edited the complete sacred choral music of Alice Mary Smith, and recorded this repertoire with The Eoferwic Consort, supported by an AHRC Knowledge Exchange Grant.

According to an obituary in &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; of 13 December 1884: &quot;Her music is marked by elegance and grace ... power and energy. Her forms were always clear and her ideas free from eccentricity; her sympathies were evidently with the Classic rather than with the Romantic school.&quot;

<text>Bluefield State University is a public historically black university (HBCU) in Bluefield, West Virginia.

==History==
The Bluefield Colored Institute was founded in 1895 as a &quot;high-graded school&quot; for African Americans. At that time, the West Virginia Constitution prohibited racially integrated public education. Bluefield was within 100 miles of 70% of the state&#x27;s African American residents. The school was located on a steep site to the north side of the Norfolk &amp; Western railroad tracks.

Principal Hamilton Hatter supervised the first class of 40 pupils. Nathan Cook Brackett, an abolitionist and first president of Storer College, served as president of the board of regents. Hatter oversaw the construction of Mahood Hall, the administrative building, as well as dormitories Lewis Hall and West Hall. Mahood Hall was named for State Senator William Mahood (R-Mercer County), who wrote the institute&#x27;s sponsoring legislation.

In 1906, Hatter was succeeded by Robert P. Sims, who would lead the institute, then college, for three decades. In 1909, the institute became a normal school, adding the training of teachers to its curriculum. By 1920, enrollment climbed to 235, with summer sessions for teacher certification adding hundreds more. Campus growth followed enrollment gains, expanding to 23 acres and the addition of Payne and Conley Halls. Enrollment grew to more than six hundred on its &quot;terraced hills.&quot;

The President&#x27;s House, later renamed Hatter Hall, was built in 1930 and added to the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1932, the State of West Virginia recognized the institute&#x27;s success, accredited its education curriculum, and changed its name to Bluefield State Teachers College.

Sims&#x27; successor, Henry Dickason, was an institute alumnus and president from 1936 to 1952. In 1943, the state again accredited an expanded curriculum and renamed the school Bluefield State College.

Neither the city nor the college were isolated from the demonstrations and demands for civil rights that dominated much of the 1960s. African American students protested that the school administration was working actively to transform Bluefield State from a historic black residential college to a commuter college with predominantly white students. Tension persisted, and on November 21, 1968, a bomb exploded in the gymnasium. No one was injured, but the damage was extensive. A $5,000 reward was offered by Governor Hulett C. Smith, and college president Wendell Hardway responded by closing all dormitories immediately and permanently. Students returning from Thanksgiving break found themselves locked out. The actions accelerated the college&#x27;s transition to a majority white student body.

Despite these changes, overall enrollment remained strong through the succeeding decades. In 2003, the West Virginia Legislature created a community college system offering two-year degrees at new institutions across the state. Among them was New River Community and Technical College. Bluefield State was required to transfer all its two-year programs, except engineering and nursing, to New River. This resulted in losing approximately half of the college&#x27;s enrollment. The succeeding years were of slow decline, with occasional calls from state legislators to merge the college with nearby Concord University.

In 2019, the board of trustees hired former West Liberty University president Robin Capehart as interim president. Later that year, Capehart and Governor Jim Justice announced the return to a residential campus with the groundbreaking for the first residence hall since the 1960s.

In 2020, Bluefield State acquired the former Bluefield Regional Medical Center property, adding 68 acres to the campus and naming the student facility the Medical Education Center Residence Hall. Former patient rooms were converted to residences; a cafeteria and lounge areas were built in time for the 2021–22 school year. Enrollment continued to grow during that time. Bluefield State leased back emergency department facilities to the Princeton Community Hospital, owners of the Bluefield Regional Medical Center.

In 2022, the state&#x27;s Higher Education Planning Commission approved the college&#x27;s first master&#x27;s degree program, a Master of Business Administration, and renamed the institution Bluefield State University.

The university garnered national attention in 2022 after the university suspended the faculty senate and created a new review system for tenured faculty members; this was quickly followed by a vote of no confidence by the university&#x27;s faculty. This prompted an investigation by the university&#x27;s accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), in September 2023. The commission&#x27;s peer review team reported that the president and board of governors &quot;do not operate with integrity in several academic and human resources functions,&quot; including accusations that the university president hired several faculty members without input from university faculty, that the president fired a staff member following their meeting with the peer review team, and that the university&#x27;s governing board were &quot;not making decisions in the best interest of the university&quot;. President Capehart resigned shortly after the report was delivered to the university. The HLC peer review team also recommended that the commission require the university to provide additional information to justify their accreditation.

==Academics==
The university is organized into six colleges/schools:

* College of Arts and Sciences
* W. Paul Cole Jr. School of Business
* College of Engineering Technology
* College of Health Sciences
* School of Criminal Justice
* School of Education
*Note: This racial-ethnic group includes Asian, Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and other racial or ethnic categories not explicitly listed in the table.

As of the 2022–2023 school year, the student body is 59.3% female and 40.6% male.

==Student life==
Bluefield State became a residential university in 2021 for the first time since 1968.

=== Athletics ===
Bluefield State athletic teams are the Big Blue. There are 21 intercollegiate varsity sports and many intramural sports.

Bluefield State belongs to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the NCAA Division II level, primarily competing in the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) since the 2023–24 academic year; its men&#x27;s wrestling team is an affiliate of Conference Carolinas. Prior to this, Bluefield State competed as a D-II independent as well as an Independent in the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) from 2013–14 to 2022–23, and as a member of the now defunct West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) from 1955–56 to 2012–13.

In 2020, President Capehart announced the return of football to the athletics program for the first time since 1980. Eleven new sports were added as well.

====History====
Sports have a prominent place in Bluefield State&#x27;s past and recent history. Teams competed in the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association—now the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA)—from 1932 to 1955. In 1955, the college joined the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) and remained there until its dissolution in 2013. It competed as an Independent until 2023 when it was re-admitted into the CIAA.

The archives of the WVIAC are housed at Bluefield State&#x27;s Jefferson Library.

In 1927 and 1928, football teams (then the &quot;Blue Devils&quot;) won Negro College Athletic Association national championships as announced by the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;. In 2020, football began its return to campus with the hiring of head coach Tony Coaxum. In 2021, the team played its first games in 41 years and finished the season with a 4–3 record. In 2022, the team played its second season as an independent and finished 4–4. In 2023, the Big Blue competed in the CIAA for the first time in 70 years against other historically black colleges and universities.

Men and women&#x27;s basketball teams competed in the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) from 1955 until its dissolution in 2013. The men&#x27;s teams were tournament finalists in 1987 and 1988. The women&#x27;s teams won conference titles in 1985, 1987, 1990 and 1993. Additionally, they won tournament titles in 1985 and 1993 and were finalists in 1986, 1989, 1992 and 1994.

The men&#x27;s golf team won a WVIAC championship in 2011. In 2021, it won the USCAA national championship.

The men&#x27;s tennis team won a WVIAC championship in 2012. It won an NCAA Regional championship in 2021 and competed in the Division II Finals for the first time.

The women&#x27;s volleyball team won the USCAA championship in 2022.

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track &amp; field teams both won the USCAA championship in 2023.

<text>Southport Football Club is an association football club based in Southport, Merseyside. The club compete in the National League North, the sixth level of the English football league system. They play their home matches at Haig Avenue, which has a capacity of 6,008. They are known by their nickname &quot;the Sandgrounders&quot;.

Founded in 1888 as Southport Central, the club were members of regional leagues such as the Lancashire League, the Lancashire Combination and The Central League for many years until 1921 when they were invited to become a founding member of the newly formed Football League Third Division North. Southport held membership of The Football League from 1921 to 1978. The club&#x27;s main honour whilst in the Football League was winning the 1972–73 Football League Fourth Division championship. They failed to gain re-election in 1978 and since then have been members of the Northern Premier League (1978 to 1993), the Football Conference (1993 to 2003) and then the Northern Premier League Premier Division (2003–04). Southport were transferred to the new National League North in 2004 and, since then, have played in either that division (tier 6) or the tier 5 National League. In 2017, Southport were relegated to their current division, the National League North.

Southport&#x27;s best performance in the FA Cup came in the 1930–31 tournament when they reached the quarter-finals (last eight) but were then beaten 9–1 by Everton at Goodison Park. Southport had another good FA Cup run in 1965–66 when they reached the fifth round (last sixteen) and were beaten 2–0 by Hull City at Boothferry Park. Southport took part in the Football League Cup from 1960 to 1978 but never progressed beyond the first two rounds. The team reached the final of the FA Trophy in 1997–98, played at the old Wembley Stadium, but lost 1–0 to Cheltenham Town.

==History==

===The Original Amateur Club: 1881–1886===

Although association football was played in the town&#x27;s private schools in the late 1870s the first association club was not formed in the town until November 1881. Bearing the name of Southport Football club, the club had originally begun as a rugby club, the &#x27;handling code&#x27; having been played competitively since 1872.

The man responsible for the decision to switch was a former Welsh international, Thomas Blundell Burnett. In the story of Southport Football Club, Burnett&#x27;s role is very significant. He was the instigator of the switch, he was the Secretary of the new club, and he was also the Captain. He was the pioneer of association football in Southport, of that there is absolutely no doubt.

The club played its games on a field on a large plot of land opposite to the entrance of Chambers Road on the corner Scarisbrick New Road and Ash Street backing onto Trap Lane (today&#x27;s Southbank Road), roughly where Westmoreland Road lies today. There was space enough for multiple pitches, one of which was used by Southport Olympic rugby club.

Encouraged by their first year, Southport joined both the Lancashire and English Football Associations and entered the English, Lancashire and Liverpool and District Challenge Cups. The competitive element of the cup-ties aroused most interest. On 7 October, Southport entertained Liverpool Ramblers in their first ever F.A., or English Challenge Cup tie as the competition was called for years. This game was watched by 300 spectators including many women supporters and resulted in a 1–1 draw, Ambler scoring for Southport following a neat pass from Arthur Dalby.

In the 1884–85 season the club merged with the Southport Athletic Society. The team moved to the Sports Ground, on Sussex Road. It was unanimously decided to change their red jerseys for red and white striped flannel shirts. The Reds were thereby now known as “The Stripes”.

As football grew in popularity other clubs sprang up in the town. Southport Wanderers, High Park, Churchtown and Southport Old Boys were amongst the most prominent. However Southport Football Club was considered to be the town&#x27;s premier side.

Off the field the club was not in a healthy state and in the 1885/86 season they were facing stiff competition from twenty six other clubs in the town. Southport reduced their annual subscriptions to five shillings to try and compete but were later forced to sever their connections with the Athletic Society and in the Athletic Society&#x27;s Annual report the Committee regretted ‘their unfortunate connection with the Football Club which resulted in the Society incurring an expenditure on their account of £88-3 shillings.

After five years existence Southport&#x27;s first football club folded.

===Southport Wanderers: 1884–1888===

Southport Wanderers formed as an amateur outfit in 1884 by members of the Southport Olympic rugby club. By the summer of 1886 Wanderers had grown into one of the most popular clubs in the town. In fact, by the time of the demise of the original Southport Football Club they were able to field a first and second eleven on a regular basis, something the original club struggled to do for much of the 1885/1886 season.

At the Wanderers AGM in June 1886, at which a representative of the original Southport association club was present, they invited Southport Football Club to amalgamate

At least six former Southport players and many of their supporters transferred their affiliations to Southport Wanderers. Southport Wanderers moved to a new ground in Scarisbrick New Road for the 1886-87 season. It was a large field, enclosed to a height of 7 foot 6 inches and big enough to accommodate three matches at once. A covered grandstand, to seat 140 spectators, and a dressing tent were provided. Three cows which grazed on the field withdrew behind the grandstand during matches.

At a General Meeting held in the Mather&#x27;s Saleroom on Chapel Street, it was unanimously resolved that in future the club be called ‘Southport Football Club’ Thus imparting to it a representative character which it had not hitherto enjoyed.

===A new professional club - Southport Central: 1888-1921===

On 2 June 1888 the Southport Guardian newspaper revealed that there was a scheme in the town to provide a football club of ‘Mighty proportions’..by raising an importation team’ Professional football was about to be launched in Southport.

In the summer of 1888, the year the Football League was founded, with the game increasing in popularity, It was felt that a team of stronger calibre should be formed to represent the district The idea met with favour and the initial meeting called to form such a club took place on 12 June at Victoria Galleries, Chapel Street.

At a second meeting, held at the Railway Hotel a week later, Mr. Robert McGown (erroneously reported in the Guardian as “McGowan”), once secretary of the High Park club, successfully proposed that the name of the club should be “Southport Central Association Football Club”.

When the proposition to form a committee was put eleven voted in favour, none against and nineteen abstained. Mr James of Hoghton Street was appointed Honorary Treasurer, Edwin Ramsbottom Secretary and an executive committee was formed.

At a meeting held on 29 August, Mr. J. B. Watson explaining the objects of the club said it was likely to place Southport in the front rank of football with the certain result of bringing increased crowds of visitors to the town and it was confirmed that “Foreign talent” would be introduced by paying players.

The club&#x27;s record for their initial season was Played 40 Won 21 Drawn 6 Lost 13.

The event which caused the most excitement in the town was the visit of Preston North End who had just carried off the League and Cup double. They came to Southport on 13 May and were given a rapturous welcome on arrival at the railway station. They were driven to the ground behind a marching band. There was a record gate of 3,500 and North End won 4-2 even though Central were re-inforced for the occasion by Forbes, Townley and Southworth of Blackburn Rovers.

The club joined the newly formed Lancashire League. Following the success of the Football League it was hardly surprising that there would be a demand for a County Competition in Lancashire At a meeting organized by the Secretary of the Earlestown club the Lancashire League became a reality. Isaac Smith, Central&#x27;s Chairman, became the league&#x27;s first treasurer.

At the start of the 1905–06 season Central moved to its present home, Haig Avenue, which was then known as Ash Lane. In 1911, the club became founder members of the Central League. In 1918, the club was renamed as Southport Vulcan – having been bought by the Vulcan Motor Company – becoming the first club to take a sponsor&#x27;s name.

===Football League: 1921–1978===

In 1921 the club, now named simply Southport, joined the Football League and became a founder member of the Third Division North. In 1931, Southport became the first club from the Third Division North to reach the sixth round (quarter-finals) of the FA Cup, where they lost 9–1 to Everton. A year later the club recorded its record attendance, when 20,010 watched them play Newcastle United in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

Having finished in the bottom half of the table at the end of the 1957–58 season, the club dropped into the Fourth Division following the reorganisation of the Third Division North and Third Division South into Third and Fourth Divisions. The club&#x27;s first promotion came at the end of the 1966–67 season, when they finished as runners-up in the Fourth Division behind Stockport County under the guidance of Billy Bingham, who later went on to manage the Northern Irish national team. They were relegated back to the Fourth Division in 1970, but won promotion again in 1973 when they finished as Fourth Division Champions. Relegation back to the Fourth Division followed the very next season. This heralded a period of decline as crowds dropped – on some occasions into just three figures – and the ground fell into disrepair.

Disaster struck in 1978, when the club was voted out of the Football League following three consecutive 23rd (out of 24) placed finishes, and was replaced by Wigan Athletic. The voting couldn&#x27;t have been tighter, as the clubs drew on the first ballot (when many had expected Rochdale to be voted out), but Wigan&#x27;s superior canvassing ensured that they won the second ballot. Southport was the last club to leave the Football League through the re-election process. Automatic relegation from the Fourth Division was introduced in 1986–87.

===Non-League football: from 1978===

After several seasons with South Liverpool, Brian Kettle was appointed manager and was instrumental in one of the most successful periods. Kettle had a difficult task from the off, his first season in charge saw him start with only three players Andy Johnston, Stuart Bimson and club captain Rob Sturgeon. After a poor start to the season which saw the club in the relegation places until mid-October after bringing in several new players such as Ossie Smith, Bob Howard, Steve Whitehall, Steve Holden, Peter Wright, Alan McDonald, the returning Ian Baines and for the third time Tony Quinn they finished the season in a very respectable seventh place in the Northern Premier League, albeit 38 points off the champions Colne Dynamoes who were not accepted for promotion and ultimately folded.

For the 1990–91 season, very little changed and was a very exciting season for the club. The free-scoring prowess of Holden and Whitehall saw the club reach 100 league goals in March and four semi-final appearances, losing only one. Ultimately due to the cup runs, the league performance suffered and they only managed to finish 5th in the league. However, there was now renewed optimism in the town.

The 1991–92 season started dreadfully for the club due to the loss of key personnel in the summer. Holden and Whitehall both left within weeks, the latter going for a club record £25,000 to Rochdale. Kettle had to rebuild once again, but it didn&#x27;t go to plan straightaway. The club were bottom of the table till September, only managing to win their first game at the start of October. After a series of good runs, they managed to claw their way up the table to once again finish seventh.

The 1992–93 season was one of the most important seasons in the clubs recent history. Southport impressively won the league with 96 points and once again scoring 100 goals and tasted success in two more cup competitions and an excellent FA Cup run took them through to the second round proper for the first time since 1968.

In 1998 the club had its first (and only) trip to Wembley, when they lost 1–0 to Cheltenham Town in the final of the FA Trophy. 10,000 Southport fans made the trip to London to see the match.

The club were relegated back to the Northern Premier League at the end of the 2002–03 season. They became founder members of the new Conference North in 2004–05, and were the league&#x27;s first Champions, earning promotion back to the newly renamed Conference National. In the 2005–06 season, Southport spent much of their time at the bottom of the table, but managed to secure survival with a five-game unbeaten run culminating in a 1–1 away draw with third-placed Grays Athletic on 25 April. The manager at the time, Liam Watson, stated that this feat was more impressive than their title winning accomplishments the season before.

===Full-time: 2006–2008===

In 2006 the club changed to full-time, with Liam Watson moving to Burscough at the end of the season a new manager in Paul Cook was appointed. This led to a massive overhaul of the squad, with many players unwilling or unable to go full-time. This proved to be a disastrous turn of events. Cook had to assemble a complete squad with just six of the original squad remaining. After a run of poor results, his contract was terminated on 3 January 2007.

The first match after Cook&#x27;s departure saw Dino Maamria and Steve Whitehall take over as caretaker manager team and they succeeded in leading the team to a 3–1 home win over free-falling Grays, a match which also saw Carl Baker make his 100th appearance in a Southport shirt.

The only other match which saw the Maamria-Whitehall manager team was a 2–1 defeat in the FA Trophy at the hands of Salisbury before Peter Davenport, who had previously had an unbeaten spell as caretaker-manager of the club in 2001, was named as Cook&#x27;s successor two weeks later.

Davenport&#x27;s new team, aided with decent signings in the transfer window, started to churn out decent results. This did not last long however, and, due to Southport&#x27;s ability to concede late goals in most games, the club looked certain to drop down a league, however again doubts were cast as the club won 4 matches on the run, and with two matches left were only two points off safety. However these matches were against play off hopefuls York City and Exeter City. After losing to a Clayton Donaldson penalty against York, the Sandgrounders were relegated the following Tuesday, not even playing a game, after relegation rivals Grays and Halifax both won their games.

The club stayed full-time, looking to bounce straight back up from the Conference North to the top of non-League football.

Southport signed Neil Prince and Karl Noon from Stalybridge Celtic and Marine respectively. Peter Davenport also brought in goalkeeper Richard Whiteside, midfielder Dave Prout and right back Chris Lever after trials from Oldham. The biggest news in the transfer period for Southport fans however, was the departure of star right winger Carl Baker to Morecambe, for a fee believed to be £50,000.

Southport Football Club announced on Monday 7 April 2008 that manager Peter Davenport and assistant Huw Griffiths left the club with immediate effect. The club placed on record their appreciation for everything they both contributed to Southport Football Club.

Former player Gary Brabin was initially given the job until the end of the season and guided the team into the play-offs only to go out on penalties away at Stalybridge Celtic, however only three days later the club announced their ambitions early by appointing him full-time and thus keeping their full-time playing status for another season at least. However, this appointment turned out to be only an agreement to sign a future contract, and after an approach from Cambridge United, Brabin left Southport to sign as Cambridge manager on 23 June 2008.

===Return to part-time: from 2008===

On 30 June 2008 the club&#x27;s official website confirmed that Liam Watson had rejoined Southport as first team manager following his resignation from Burscough.

This change saw the arrival of numerous part-time players, following Watson from Burscough including Conference North top scorer Ciaran Kilheeney, Watson&#x27;s co-Players of the Year – Adam Flynn and Anthony McMillan, as well former Southport players, Matty McGinn, Earl Davis, Robbie Booth and Steve Daly. Retained players, Michael Powell and Neil Robinson, chose to return to part-time football, whilst Matt Hocking, Neil Prince and club captain, Chris Holland left the club. Kevin Lee and Tony Gray signed new part-time contracts at the start of the season, and thus Southport practically returned fully to a part-time club. During that season Tony Gray and John Doolan departed the club, as well as Craig Noone, who moved to Championship side Plymouth Argyle.

The 2008–09 season saw Southport reach the Conference North play-offs, having finished in fifth place. However, a home defeat, followed by an away draw against Gateshead left Southport to battle for a further season in the Conference North. Only four defeats during 2009–10 saw Southport finally secure the League title following a 3–0 away victory at Eastwood Town on the final Saturday of the season, spurred on by over 700 travelling Sandgrounders. They finished just one point ahead of near neighbours Fleetwood Town. The success of the first team, who also lifted the Lancashire FA Challenge Trophy following victory against Clitheroe at the Reebok Stadium, was mirrored by the club&#x27;s youth team who won both the Lancashire League and Conference North Youth League.

===Non-League top flight (2010 to 2017)===

In 2010–11, the first season back in the Conference, Southport finished in the relegation zone of the Conference National, but were reprieved after Rushden &amp; Diamonds were expelled from the league.

The 2011–12 season saw a change of fortune for the club, with the implementation of a new, extended training schedule seeing an upturn in performances and results. On 26 November 2011, a club record of consecutive away victories was broken with the Sandgrounder&#x27;s 1–0 win at Stockport County, their 8th in succession. Although narrowly missing out on a play off spot, having occupied one of the top five positions for long periods of the season, the 2011–12 season saw the &#x27;Port finish in a very impressive 7th place, the club&#x27;s highest league finish in 10 years.

During the 2012–13 season Southport failed to repeat its successful performance in the prior season and finished 5th from bottom, just one place above the relegation zone. On 17 April 2013 it was announced that Watson would be leaving Southport once again, but on more amiable terms resigning, ostensibly, in order to &#x27;take a break from the game&#x27;. Soon after, he was appointed manager of AFC Telford who he led to promotion in his first season.

On 15 May 2013, Alan Wright was appointed Southport manager, along with John Hills as his assistant manager. Southport kicked off the 2013–14 season with a 1–0 home win over Luton Town, just the beginning of a good start to the season, Wright managed the team to four straight home wins. However the good form didn&#x27;t last long, a run of 8 straight defeats away from home saw Wright&#x27;s side drop to the lower half of the table. A 2–2 draw to Macclesfield ended the losing away run, followed by a 6–2 victory over Marske United in the FA Cup 4th Qualifying Round and a 1–0 win against previously unbeaten table toppers Cambridge United. This looked like a catalyst for a turnaround in fortunes, however Southport lost their next six games, eliminated from both the FA Cup and FA Trophy, and sat in 18th place in the table, Alan Wright left the club on Friday 7 December 2013.

His replacement was named just a day later on Saturday 8 December 2013, as John Coleman, former Accrington Stanley manager, who had previously played for Southport over 25 years earlier. Under Coleman the club escaped relegation, finishing the season in fine form. This spell also led to a change in the club&#x27;s training schedule, with sessions during the day, rather than evening, unlike a majority of part-time clubs.

To the consternation of the fans, Coleman was not retained as manager; instead the Board appointed Martin Foyle formerly the manager of Hereford United. A number of first team players left the club at the end of the season (including several who had been on loan) leaving Foyle with a major rebuilding task for the 2014–15 season. Foyle was dismissed in October 2014 and replaced by Gary Brabin who returned to the club for his second spell as manager. Despite a run in the FA Cup culminating in a spirited third round defeat to Championship side Derby County, Brabin&#x27;s spell was short lived, accepting an academy role with Everton. Paul Carden, previously assistant to Brabin, became manager and was joined by Alex Russell as assistant manager, son of the club legend of the same name. The club secured Conference survival yet again in 2015, finishing 19th in the league.

Carden&#x27;s team started the 2015–16 season in poor form, leading to his departure from the club in November 2015, Dino Maamria became Southport&#x27;s seventh manager since April 2013 shortly after. On 19 March 2016 Andy Bishop was appointed caretaker player/manager of the club after Dino Maamria left the club for family reasons.

On 6 September 2016, Liam Watson was announced as returning to Southport for the third time but in a new capacity. Watson joined the board of directors along with local businessmen Nigel Allen and David Barron. He will take up the newly created role as Operations Director. Steve Burr was announced as the manager of Southport on 8 September 2016 following the departure of Andy Bishop 5 days earlier.

On 30 January 2017 Steve Burr was sacked after a poor run of form and being one point above the drop zone. Andy Preece was appointed Manager on 8 February, their eleventh since April 2013 but another poor run of form saw them slip to the foot of the table in March. On Friday 14 April 2017, Southport relegation to the National League North was confirmed after a 3–0 loss to Dover Athletic. Following confirmation of relegation, long term chairman Charlie Clapham announced he would be stepping from the board of directors on 21 April 2017, along with vice-chairman Sam Shrouder. Southport then parted ways with Manager Andy Preece on 5 May 2017.

===National League North and new board===

On 15 May 2017 it was announced that local accountant and supporter James Treadwell would become the club&#x27;s new chairman, his first appointment was to welcome back former manager Mark Wright as Head of Development. Southport appointed Alan Lewer as manager on 30 May 2017. The 2017–18 season started well for the new management team, winning the five of their first eight league games. Following supporter&#x27;s campaigning since May, law firm director Phil Hodgkinson joined the board of directors on 5 September 2017. Having lost their next six games after this date, Wright and Lewer were dismissed on 26 September 2017.

Kevin Davies was appointed manager on 18 October 2017 on a two-and-a-half-year contract. Southport secured survival on 21 April 2018 despite losing 1–0 to Brackley Town. Despite this, Davies was dismissed as manager on 30 April 2018. After a spell scouting for Scunthorpe United, Liam Watson was reappointed manager of Southport on 7 May 2018.

It was confirmed during the summer of 2019 that Phil Hodgkinson would step down as Southport&#x27;s owner and director so that he could replace Dean Hoyle as majority shareholder and chairman of Championship club Huddersfield Town. On his departure from Southport, Hodgkinson sold his shares to Ian Kyle, Steve Porter and manager, Liam Watson, to create a new-look boardroom.

Long serving manager Liam Watson stepped back from this role after a poor start to the 2023/34 season, to focus on his position as Club Director. Jim Bentley was appointed the club&#x27;s new manager on 29 August 2023.

===New Ownership (2023)===
On 27 October 2023, it was announced that Big Help Group had acquired Southport FC and become the majority shareholder following the purchase of Ian Kyle&#x27;s shares. The former chairman has subsequently been succeeded by Big Help Group&#x27;s CEO, Peter Mitchell.

On November 10, 2023, Southport FC, under the new ownership of the Big Help Group, held its first Fan Forum since the takeover. This significant event featured Assistant Manager Andy Burgess announcing the introduction of GPS vests in player training, signifying a step towards modernizing training methods and enhancing player performance analytics.

At the forum, Peter Mitchell shared his vision for the club, stating, &quot;We aspire to be a full-time football club, I don&#x27;t know when we&#x27;re going to be able to reach that aspiration, but absolutely we aspire to be in full-time football.&quot; He further emphasized the club&#x27;s financial commitment towards this goal, revealing, &quot;We&#x27;ve committed to a quarter of a million pound of equity investment now, and we&#x27;ve also committed to a further quarter of a million pounds for the start of next season.&quot;

The event also highlighted plans for infrastructure development at the club&#x27;s football ground. Mitchell discussed the board&#x27;s deliberations on enhancing the ground, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve just been talking about it at the board meeting, about putting a plan together for the ground. I&#x27;m going to look at getting plans drawn up for a two-story changing facility to the left of the main stand, where we can have dressing rooms and changing rooms for the two teams and officials, and some offices above it.&quot; He added that he intends to submit planning permissions with Sefton Council for this project, in a bid to get the &quot;off the field facilities right&quot;, so they have better chances of being accepted into the Football League.

==Summary of recent seasons==

==Trust in Yellow==

Trust in Yellow is the Supporters&#x27; Trust of the club. It was formed on 26 April 2006 by a set of supporters who were unhappy with the lack of communication between the club and its fans in an effort to get more involved and have a bigger say in the running of the club. T.I.Y. is a member of Supporters&#x27; Direct, a body funded by Sport England. In 2021, the Trust funded the building of a new Fanzone building inside the club&#x27;s stadium, however since the completion of this project the Trust has been effectively defunct.

<doc id="1239132" wikidata="Q976915" url="?curid=1239132" title="Dionysius, Metropolitan of Kiev">
<text>Saint Dionysius I (, &quot;Dionisii&quot;); secular name: David (1300? – 15 October 1385), was a Russian Orthodox metropolitan in 1384–1385.

A native of the Duchy of Kiev as a young man David entered the Kyiv Caves Lavra, where he was tonsured a hieromonk and given the religious name Dionysius. He is known to have spent a number of years living in a cave that he dug out himself on the banks of the Volga River not far from Nizhny Novgorod. Later, Dionysius founded the Pechersky Monastery on that same spot, which was dedicated in honour of the Ascension of the Lord. In 1374, he was consecrated the Bishop of Suzdal and won love and respect on the part of the locals.

In 1378, Dionysius was recommended as Metropolitan of Kyiv by St. Sergius of Radonezh after the death of Metropolitan Alexius. However, Grand Prince Dmitri Donskoi had his own candidate – a priest by the name of Mikhail (Mityaya). Dionysius was one of a number of bishops at the council who opposed Mikhail, who was suspected of heresy (Strigolniki). If elected, Mikhail wanted to introduce a new way of enthroning the Metropolitan at home, in Russia, rather than traveling to Constantinople to be installed by the Ecumenical Patriarch (at the time, Russia was not yet an autocephalous church). In 1379 Dionysius went to Constantinople carrying a protest against the choice of Mikhail addressed to the Patriarch. Mikhail was afraid that Dionysius would get the patriarch&#x27;s blessing and followed him to Constantinople. However, Mikhail died on his way there and one of his accompanying clergymen, Archmandrite Pimen, reached Constantinople before Dionysius and was named Metropolitan of Moscow and All Rus&#x27; in place of Mikhail.

In 1382, Dionysius received the title of archbishop from the Patriarch, who was impressed with his piety and humility. In 1383, Dionysius returned from this long journey to his at Suzdal and continued his struggle against the Strigolniki. He also implored Dmitri Donskoi against Pimen, whom he viewed as a usurper, since no one in the Russian Church, not even the Great Prince himself, had been consulted before Pimen was appointed Metropolitan. In 1384, Dionysius was sent back to Constantinople to ask for Pimen&#x27;s deposition and his own appointment as Metropolitan. Patriarch Neilus Kerameus was not sure whether he could trust Dionysius and sent two metropolitans to Moscow, who were supposed to depose Pimen and install the archbishop of Suzdal. On his way back to Moscow, Dionysius stopped in Kiev, where he was detained by the Kievan prince Vladimir Olgerdovich at the insistence of Cyprian, Archbishop of Kiev, who was to have succeeded as Metropolitan of Moscow in 1378 upon the death of Alexius, but who was not finally welcomed into Moscow until 1390. Dionysius died in detention on 15 October 1385. He was buried in the Caves of St. Anthony at Kiev, in the monastery in which he began his spiritual life.

The Russian Orthodox Church used to celebrate his feast day on 19 July, but subsequently this tradition died down. He is now commemorated on 15 October of the traditional Julian Calendar (28 October on the modern Gregorian Calendar), where he is listed as &quot;Metropolitan of Suzdal&quot;, since he was never able to take possession of his Metropolitan See.

<text>Thomas Johnstone Lawrence (14 May 1940 – 10 January 2018) was a Scottish professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Liverpool and Tranmere Rovers from the 1950s to the 1970s. Lawrence was with Liverpool for 14 years, making more than 300 league appearances, and he played in three full internationals for Scotland during the 1960s.

==Early years==
Lawrence was born Thomas Johnstone in Dailly, Ayrshire, one of three children of Frank and Ruby Lawrence. The Lawrence family moved to North West England when Tommy was a child along with elder brother William (Billy) and younger sister Mary. 
On leaving school he worked at Rylands wire factory and played for Croft Village Football Team, and then Stockton Heath as an amateur.

==Club career==
===Liverpool, 1957–1971===
Aged 17, Lawrence was signed by Liverpool under the management of Phil Taylor in 1957. He made his first team debut under manager Bill Shankly, playing in a 1–0 defeat against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns on 27 October 1962. His first clean-sheet came on 17 November, when Liverpool beat fellow promotion hopefuls Leyton Orient at Anfield 5–0, with Roger Hunt scoring a hat-trick.

Lawrence went on to retain the No.1 jersey that season making 35 appearances, including 6 ties in Liverpool&#x27;s run to the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough. Leicester City were their opponents and prevented the Reds from reaching the 1963 FA Cup final by winning the game 1–0. Liverpool had finished in 8th place in their first season back in the First Division, as their Merseyside rivals Everton won the 1962–63 league championship. The following season Lawrence played in 40 league games out of a possible 42, and he also played in 5 cup ties. Liverpool won the 1963–64 league championship, four points clear of Manchester United.

In the 1964–65 season Lawrence and Liverpool were unable to repeat the previous season&#x27;s achievements, finishing in 7th place and a full 17 points behind winners Manchester United. However, a cup run took Liverpool to the 1965 FA Cup final, where they faced Leeds United at Wembley. It was Liverpool&#x27;s first cup final appearance since 1950, and they had never won the trophy before. Both sides had only conceded two goals during their runs to the final. Lawrence kept a clean sheet during the 90 minutes of normal time, but Liverpool also could not score so the game went into extra-time. After 3 minutes of the extra period Roger Hunt opened the scoring for Liverpool, but the lead lasted just 2 minutes as Billy Bremner scored the equaliser. In the 113th minute Ian St John headed the ball home for the winner to seal Liverpool&#x27;s first F.A. Cup victory.

Lawrence enjoyed more success the following season as the Reds found their league form once more, winning the 1965–66 title by 6 clear points over Leeds. Such was Lawrence&#x27;s form, consistency and durability he missed only a handful of games during eight years as the regular Liverpool goalkeeper. He earned the affectionate nickname &quot;The Flying Pig&quot; because of his ability to dive around the penalty area despite weighing more than . He is credited with being one of the first sweeper-keepers.

Lawrence held off the challenge of teenage keeper Ray Clemence when the youngster arrived from Scunthorpe United in 1967, but Liverpool had begun to decline as the team aged. Though Lawrence was not the eldest, he was suddenly removed from the team in favour of Clemence after a 1–0 6th round FA Cup defeat at Watford in 1970; along with outfield players Ron Yeats and Ian St John. Lawrence played for Liverpool only once more, against Manchester City in a 2–2 draw at Maine Road on 26 April 1971.

===Tranmere Rovers, 1971–1974===
After 390 appearances in the Liverpool goal, Lawrence joined Tranmere Rovers on 10 November 1971. He spent three years and made 80 league appearances for Tranmere under player/manager and ex-Liverpool teammate, Ron Yeats. Lawrence then drifted back into the non-league game with Chorley, before retiring.

==International career==
During his time at Liverpool, Lawrence won three caps for Scotland. His international debut came on 3 June 1963 in a friendly international at Dalymount Park, Dublin, which the Republic of Ireland won 1–0. Lawrence had to wait six years for his second and third caps, a 1–1 draw with West Germany in a 1970 World Cup qualifier and a 5–3 victory over Wales in a British Home Championship match. During the latter appearance, his last international, Lawrence collided with the crossbar and had to be carried off.

==Later years and death==
After Lawrence retired from professional football he returned to work at Rylands, the wire manufacturer.

In February 2015, Lawrence was inadvertently interviewed in the street by BBC journalist Stuart Flinders, who was asking elderly people if they remembered the 1966–67 FA Cup Fifth Round game between Liverpool and Everton. Lawrence, smiling, replied, &quot;Yeah, I do. I played in it. I was the goalkeeper for Liverpool.&quot;

Lawrence died on 10 January 2018 in Warrington, at the age of 77.

<doc id="1239142" wikidata="Q7863484" url="?curid=1239142" title="U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions">
<text>Prior to the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2015), U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions of several different types passed, banning legal recognition of same-sex unions in U.S. state constitutions, referred to by proponents as &quot;defense of marriage amendments&quot; or &quot;marriage protection amendments.&quot; These state amendments are different from the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would ban same-sex marriage in every U.S. state, and Section 2 of the Defense of Marriage Act, more commonly known as DOMA, which allowed the states not to recognize same-sex marriages from other states. The amendments define marriage as a union between one man and one woman and prevent civil unions or same-sex marriages from being legalized, though some of the amendments bar only the latter. The &quot;Obergefell&quot; decision in June 2015 invalidated these state constitutional amendments insofar as they prevented same-sex couples from marrying, even though the actual text of these amendments remain written into the state constitutions.

Thirty-one U.S. state constitutional amendments banning legal recognition of same-sex unions have been adopted. Of these, ten make only same-sex marriage unconstitutional; sixteen make both same-sex marriage and civil unions unconstitutional; two make same-sex marriage, civil unions, and other contracts unconstitutional; and one is unique. Hawaii&#x27;s amendment is unique in that it does not make same-sex marriage unconstitutional; rather, it allows the state to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples. Virginia&#x27;s amendment prevents the state from recognizing private contracts that &quot;approximate&quot; marriage. Observers have pointed out that such language encompasses private contracts and medical directives. Furthermore, the Michigan Supreme Court has held that the state&#x27;s amendment bans not only same-sex marriage and civil unions, but also domestic partnership benefits such as health insurance. On November 3, 2020, Nevada became the first U.S. state to repeal its amendment banning same-sex marriage following approval of 2020 Nevada Question 2.

State constitutional amendments are typically approved first by the legislature or special constitutional convention and then by the voters in a referendum. In some states, one or both of these steps is repeated. The percentages shown in the list are results from the referendum stage, not the legislative stage.

==History==
The idea of extending marriage rights to same-sex couples did not become a political issue in the United States until the 1990s. During that decade, several Western European countries legalized civil unions, and in 1993 the Supreme Court of Hawaii ruled in &quot;Baehr v. Lewin&quot;, 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993), that refusing to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples was sex-discrimination under that state&#x27;s constitution. In response, voters passed Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2. This amendment differed from future marriage amendments in other states as it did not ban same-sex marriage itself, but merely empowered the state legislature to enact such a ban. In November 1998, 69% of Hawaii voters approved the amendment, and the state legislature exercised its power to ban same-sex marriage. Only three constitutional bans on same-sex unions (in Alaska, Nebraska, and Nevada) were proposed between 1998 and 2003.
All three amendments passed. In Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court&#x27;s November 2003 decision in &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot;, the court legalized same-sex marriage in Massachusetts. Social and religious conservatives feared that their own state supreme courts would issue such rulings at some point in the future; in order to prevent this, they proposed additional constitutional bans on same-sex marriage. The following year, eleven constitutional referendums banning same-sex unions were placed on state ballots.

On April 3, 2009, Nate Silver post his model of the predicted years that each of the 50 states would vote against a marriage ban, with the last one being Mississippi in 2024.

==Purpose and motivation==

Constitutional bans on same-sex unions were advocated in response to the legalization of same-sex marriage in other jurisdictions, notably Canada and Massachusetts.

Some amendments and some proposed amendments forbade a state from recognizing even non-marital civil unions and domestic partnerships, while others explicitly allowed for same-sex unions that were not called &quot;marriages&quot;.

Such amendments had two main purposes:
* Preventing a state&#x27;s courts interpreting their state&#x27;s constitution to permit or require legalization of same-sex marriage.
* Preventing a state&#x27;s courts recognizing same-sex marriages that were legally performed in other jurisdictions.

Some proponents of such amendments feared that states would be forced to recognize same-sex marriages celebrated in other jurisdictions. They pointed to the full faith and credit clause, which requires each state to recognize the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of each other state. On the other hand, opponents argued that state constitutional amendments would do nothing to resolve this perceived problem. Traditionally, courts have held that a state is free to decline to recognize a marriage celebrated elsewhere if the marriage violates the state&#x27;s strong public policy. (§134 of the First Restatement of Conflicts, on Marriage and Legitimacy (1934)). That tradition was broken in 1967 with the &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; case decided by a unanimous Supreme Court, which confirmed that the full faith and credit clause did require recognition of all legal marriages. Similarly, in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; the Supreme Court ruled that the federal constitution required state recognition of same-sex marriages. All state constitutions are trumped by the federal constitution due to the supremacy clause.

===Conservative mobilization===
State referendums on constitutional bans of same-sex unions have at times been accused of having been used as a &quot;get-out-the-vote&quot; tactic by some Republicans and social conservatives. When voters see that a particular legislative initiative appears on the ballot, they are thought to feel more motivated to turn out to vote, enhancing ballot numbers for other candidates and issues of their party. The presence of these amendments on state ballots has been credited by some as supposedly providing a boost to Republicans in the 2004 election, and the 2004 Ohio amendment in particular has been cited as aiding President George W. Bush&#x27;s reelection campaign by motivating evangelical social conservatives in the state to go to the polls. President George W. Bush&#x27;s close political consultant, Karl Rove, has been an enthusiastic proponent and organizer of legislation banning same-sex unions.

After the 2006 elections some activists argued that such referendums were starting to lose their potential to mobilize conservative voters. Kevin Cathcart, director of Lambda Legal pointed to the narrow defeat of Arizona&#x27;s Proposition 107, which would have rendered civil unions as well as same-sex marriage unconstitutional. Nevertheless, that same election saw seven such amendments pass; these seven included an amendment in Virginia which banned civil unions as well as same-sex marriages.

==Variants==
Most U.S. state constitutional amendments banning same-sex unions banned civil unions as well as same-sex marriage.

Two marriage amendments differed greatly from all others: Hawaii&#x27;s and Virginia&#x27;s. The former gave the Hawaii state legislature the authority to ban same-sex marriages but did not explicitly make such unions unconstitutional. Virginia&#x27;s amendment not only banned same-sex marriage and civil unions, but arguably rendered any state recognition of private contracts entered into by unmarried couples unconstitutional.

==Approved amendments==
===Amendments that ban same-sex marriage===

===Amendments that ban same-sex marriage and civil unions, but not other contracts===

===Amendments that ban same-sex marriage, civil unions, and other contracts===

==Repealed amendments==

==Failed amendments==
* Arizona Proposition 107 – On November 7, 2006, Arizona rejected a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage and civil unions by 51.8% of the vote. Two years later Arizona voters approved a more narrow amendment banning only same-sex marriage.
* Minnesota Amendment 1 – On November 6, 2012, Minnesota rejected a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage with 51.90% of the electorate opposed. A majority of all votes cast would be required to amend the state constitution.

==&quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;==

On June 26, 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Obergefell&quot; that state laws banning same-sex marriage violate the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, rendering such laws unconstitutional and invalidating the remaining 14 same-sex marriage bans still being fully or partially enforced.

As of 2016, bills have been introduced in Virginia and other states to legislatively repeal the null-and-void amendments.

<doc id="1239143" wikidata="Q4726220" url="?curid=1239143" title="Alicia's Diary">
<text>&quot;Alicia&#x27;s Diary&quot; is a short story written by Victorian novelist Thomas Hardy in 1887. It is the diary of a girl named Alicia that is a tragic romance. The story was reprinted in the 1913 collection &quot;A Changed Man and Other Tales&quot;.

==Plot==
Her sister, Caroline, and their mother have gone to France, and eventually Alicia&#x27;s suspicions are confirmed that Caroline has become engaged to an artist named Charles. Charles keeps postponing the wedding. Alicia&#x27;s mother dies. Due to the death of their mother and the coldness and procrastination of Charles to her, Caroline is dying. Also, Alicia tries to leave them alone to catalyse the romantic process and to avoid charming Charles. Charles catches a glimpse of Alicia, and they soon fall in love with each other. Needless to say, Alicia feels very guilty because of her incestuous feelings toward the fiancée of her sister. Alicia and Charles make a deal that Charles should marry the dying Caroline, but not tell her it wasn&#x27;t a legitimate marriage. If Caroline dies, Alicia and Charles can be married. If Caroline lives and does not want to marry Charles (after they tell her it wasn&#x27;t a legitimate wedding), Alicia is free to marry Charles. The third option comes to pass, so Alicia must sacrifice her love for Charles and yield to her sister marrying Charles. Caroline and Charles marry. Shortly following the wedding, Charles leaves and does not return. Four months later, Alicia informs us that Charles drowned himself. Five years later, Alicia adds a final note that Caroline married a man named Higham, who was the one who pretended to marry Caroline and Charles. Alicia ends the short story by concluding that everyone involved in deceiving her sister have now repented (Higham by love, she says). &quot;[M]ay she be deceived no more.&quot;

<doc id="1239147" wikidata="Q4222906" url="?curid=1239147" title="Clan Kennedy">
<text>Clan Kennedy is a Scottish clan of the Scottish Lowlands.

==History==
===Origins of the clan===

The Votadini were a tribe in Lothian and their chief, Cunedda, was sent by the British leader, Vortigern, to establish settlements in order to resist Picto-Scottish sea raids in the south west of Scotland. These settlements spread down the west coast as far as Wales. Cunedda is rendered as &quot;Cinneidgh&quot; in the Celtic language, meaning &quot;ugly&quot; or &quot;grim-headed&quot;. The name became associated with the district of Carrick, Scotland.

During the early part of the reign of William the Lion, Gilbert Mac Kenedi witnessed a charter to Melrose Abbey granting lands in Carrick. During the reign of Alexander II of Scotland Gillespie Kennedy is named in charters as the senechal of Carrick.

===Wars of Scottish Independence===

Kennedys supported Robert the Bruce during the Wars of Scottish Independence. Kennedys inherited the Earldom of Carrick from the line of Sir John Kennedy of Dunure&#x27;s wife, Mary de Carrick, who descended from Sir Gilbert De Carrick. In 1372, Robert II of Scotland rewarded John Kennedy of Dunure as chief of his name and baillie of Carrick.

===15th and 16th centuries===

In about 1457 John&#x27;s direct descendant, Gillbert, was created Lord Kennedy. He was also a regent to the infant James III of Scotland. James Kennedy, brother of the first Lord Kennedy, was one of Scotland&#x27;s best loved bishops. James served briefly as High Chancellor of Scotland and was also Bishop of Dunkeld, and also later Archbishop of St Andrews. In 1450 he founded St Salvator&#x27;s College.

Hugh Kennedy of Ardstinchar was a Scots mercenary who fought at the Siege of Orléans for Joan of Arc. As a result, Joan figures on the arms of Kennedy of Bargany.

In 1509, Sir David Kennedy, the third Lord Kennedy was created Earl of Cassillis. He was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. The second Earl of Cassillis was murdered in 1527. Gillbert Kennedy, the third Earl, was one of four Scottish commissioners who were poisoned on their return from the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots to the Dauphin of France in 1558. The third Earl had inherited his title at the age of twelve and one of his first acts was to sign the death warrant of Patrick Hamilton, the first Scottish Protestant martyr.

The Moray Kennedys were a branch of the clan who travelled north with the sister of the third Lord Kennedy, Janet Kennedy who had a son by James IV of Scotland, as part of the possession of the earldom of Moray. The Moray Kennedys became a sept of the Clan Cameron.

===17th century and Civil War===

In 1601 the Kennedy Earls of Cassilis were involved in a feud against their relations, the Kennedy Lairds of Bargany. The Earls of Cassillis were supported by the Clan Fergusson and the Laird of Bargany was killed.

From 1649 to 1651, John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis was Lord Justice General of Scotland and a zealous Protestant. He and his son, the seventh Earl, were both firm supporters of Parliament during the Civil War. The Justice General also sat in Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s House of Lords. The Kennedys suffered for their beliefs but their estates remained largely intact.

The Kennedy of Kermuck branch of the clan were hereditary constables of Aberdeen from at least 1413. The Kennedys of Kermuck were outlawed when in 1652 the father and son of the family mortally wounded John Forbes of Watertown.

===18th and 19th centuries===

When the Eighth Earl of Cassillis died there was a court dispute lasting three years to determine the succession. The titles and estates of the Kennedys were claimed by William Douglas, afterwards duke of Queensberry, a great grandson in the female line of the 7th earl and also by Sir Thomas Kennedy, Bart., of Culzean, a descendant of the 3rd earl, i.e. by the heir general and the heir male. In January 1762, the House of Lords found in favour of Thomas. On 30 November 1775, Thomas died unmarried, and was succeeded by his brother David, who commissioned Robert Adam to build Culzean Castle, and died unmarried on 18 December 1792.

With David, the baronetcy became extinct. The earldom of Cassillis now passed to a cousin, Archibald Kennedy, a captain in the royal navy, whose father, Archibald Kennedy (died 1763), had migrated to America in 1722 and had become collector of customs in New York. His son, the 11th earl, had estates in New Jersey and married an American heiress; in 1765 he was said to own more houses in New York than any one else. He died in London on 30 December 1794, and was succeeded by his son Archibald (1770–1846), who was created Baron Ailsa in 1806 and marquess of Ailsa in 1831. His great-grandson Archibald (born 1847) became 3rd marquess.
Lieutenant General Sir Clark Kennedy served through the entire Peninsular War and in 1815 he commanded the centre squadron of the Royal Dragoons at the Battle of Waterloo. At Waterloo he personally captured the eagle and colours of the 105th Regiment of French Infantry. Sir Clark was from the Kennedy of Moray branch of the clan.

=== 20th century ===
The lawyer, historian, author and campaigner for the righting of legal injustice, Ludovic Kennedy was a notable member of the Kennedy clan. In his collected writings, he recalls the story of his forebear, Captain Archibald Kennedy returning from New York at the end of the 18C to Culzean Castle to assume the earldom of Cassillis

<doc id="1239149" wikidata="Q58440" url="?curid=1239149" title="Oyashio Current">
<text>The , also known as the [[Sea of Okhotsk|Okhotsk]] Current or [[Kuril Islands|Kurile]] Current, is a cold subarctic ocean current that flows south and circulates counterclockwise in the western North Pacific Ocean. The waters of the Oyashio Current originate in the Arctic Ocean and flow southward via the Bering Sea, passing through the Bering Strait and transporting cold water from the Arctic Sea into the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk. It collides with the Kuroshio Current off the eastern shore of Japan to form the North Pacific Current (or Drift).
The nutrient-rich Oyashio is named for its metaphorical role as the that provides for and nurtures marine organisms.

==Climate impact==
The current has an important impact on the climate of the Russian Far East, mainly in Kamchatka and Chukotka, where the northern limit of tree growth is moved south up to ten degrees compared with the latitude it can reach in inland Siberia. The waters of the Oyashio Current form probably the richest fishery in the world owing to the extremely high nutrient content of the cold water and the very high tides (up to ) in some areas – which further enhances the availability of nutrients. However, the Oyashio Current also causes Vladivostok to be the most equatorward port to seasonally freeze and require icebreaking ships to remain open in winter. Nonetheless, this has relatively little effect on the fish yield through the Sea of Okhotsk, because the large tides mean freezing does not occur so easily.

==History==
During glacial periods, when lower sea level exposed the Bering land bridge, the current could not flow in the regions the Oyashio affects today. The level of cooling with the onset of glacial conditions (after an interglacial) was much less than in other areas of the Earth at similar latitudes. This allowed Tōhoku and Hokkaidō – the only areas of East Asia with enough snowfall to potentially form glaciers – to remain unglaciated except at high elevations during periods when Europe and North America were largely glaciated. This lack of glaciation explains why, despite its present climate being much colder than most of Europe, East Asia has retained 96 percent of Pliocene tree genera, whereas Europe has retained only 27%.

<doc id="1239151" wikidata="Q6910897" url="?curid=1239151" title="More Adventurous">
<text>More Adventurous is the third studio album by American indie rock band Rilo Kiley. Released on August 17, 2004 by Brute/Beaute Records, a self-made imprint distributed by Warner Records, it was the band&#x27;s major label debut.

As of June 2007, sales of the album in the United States had exceeded 173,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Song information==
&quot;Portions for Foxes&quot; references the bible verse .

To achieve the vulnerable effect for which the song was intended, Lewis recorded her vocal for &quot;I Never&quot; naked in the studio.

&quot;Ripchord&quot; and &quot;It Just Is&quot; were written in response to the death of Elliott Smith.

&quot;Accidntel Deth&quot; was produced by Jimmy Tamborello, who is known for his work in The Postal Service and as Dntel (which explains the unusual spelling of the song&#x27;s title).

&quot;More Adventurous&quot; alludes to a line from Frank O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s &quot;Meditations in an Emergency&quot;: &quot;Each time my heart is broken it makes me feel more adventurous (and how the same names keep recurring on that interminable list!), but one of these days there’ll be nothing left with which to venture forth.&quot;

==Release==
Two versions of the album were released: a version in a jewel case, which was sold in stores, and a limited edition (1,000 copies) digipak version sold at the release party and concert for the album.

&quot;I Never&quot; and &quot;Ripchord&quot; were included in several feature films, including &quot;Must Love Dogs&quot;, &quot;Conversations with Other Women&quot;, and &quot;John Tucker Must Die&quot;. &quot;Portions for Foxes&quot; is included as part of the &quot;Rock Band 3&quot; soundtrack and was also featured in the first episode of the first season of the medical drama Grey&#x27;s Anatomy. &quot;More Adventurous&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;.

==Reception==
The album received critical praise. Noted rock critic Robert Christgau named it the fifth best release of 2004 and later included it in his list of the greatest albums of the 2000-2009 decade, placing it in the twenty-fourth spot. Christgau also declared &quot;It&#x27;s a Hit&quot; song of the year for 2004 and subsequently listed it as the eighth best song of the decade. The album placed fourteenth on the Pazz &amp; Jop poll for 2004.

In 2017, NPR Music&#x27;s Ilana Kaplan dubbed the album &quot;a masterpiece in songwriting vulnerability.&quot; Kaplan dubbed Jenny Lewis &quot;an emo pioneer&quot;, citing her &quot;bold confrontation of anger and her ability to mourn in such a raw way&quot; as reasons. She also noted that Lewis&#x27; handling of topics like marriage, divorce, and more &quot;set apart her perspective in the midst of male voices&quot; prominent within the genre.

In 2023, alternative music website &quot;Melophobe&quot; ranked the album as the 28th best indie rock album of all time. &quot;Melophobe&quot; subsequently ranked &quot;It&#x27;s a Hit&quot; and &quot;Portions For Foxes&quot; as the 15th and 51st greatest indie rock songs since 2000 respectively.

<text>Monte Hacho is a low mountain that overlooks the Spanish city of Ceuta, on the north coast of Africa. Monte Hacho is positioned on the Mediterranean coast at the Strait of Gibraltar opposite Gibraltar, and along with the Rock of Gibraltar is claimed by some to be one of the Pillars of Hercules (the other candidate for the southern pillar being Jebel Musa). According to the legend, Hercules pushed apart the two mountains and created a link between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.

In classical civilization it was possibly known as Mons Abila (Mount Abila or Abyla), although this title could refer to Jebel Musa instead.

Monte Hacho is located on the Península de Almina and topped by a fort, the Fortaleza de Hacho, which was first built by the Byzantines, before being added to by the Arabs, Portuguese and Spanish. It is now occupied by the Spanish army. Monte Hacho also has a convent, Ermita de San Antonio, and Monumento del Llano Amarillo which is a monument to Generalisimo Francisco Franco and the start of the Spanish Civil War in North Africa in 1936.

<doc id="1239159" wikidata="Q7895139" url="?curid=1239159" title="Peter A. Allard School of Law">
<text>The Peter A. Allard School of Law (abbreviated as Allard Law) is the law school of the University of British Columbia. The faculty offers the Juris Doctor degree. The faculty features courses on business law, tax law, environmental and natural resource law, indigenous law, Pacific Rim issues, and feminist legal theory.

It was renamed from the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law in 2015 to honour a $30M gift from Peter Allard, an alumnus, which followed a 2011 gift from him of about $12M.

==History==
UBC offered lectures in law from 1920, but the university&#x27;s faculty of law was established in 1945, and was served by George F. Curtis (1906–2005) as the founding dean, until he retired in 1971. Because it lacked adequate infrastructure, the law school used army huts from World War II, until a permanent structure was built in 1951, which was named after Curtis; it was replaced by Allard Hall in 2009.

In recognition of a donation from UBC law alumnus Peter A. Allard, the law school was renamed the Peter A. Allard School of Law, on 22 January 2015; previously, it had been named University of British Columbia Faculty of Law. Allard is the son of one-time Edmonton Oilers co-owner, Dr. Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Allard, who also brought the SCTV sketch comedy television series to Edmonton.

==Academics==
In 2023, both QS World and Times Higher Education ranked Allard the second-best common law school in the Canada, ranking behind only the University of Toronto. Academically, the school is amongst the most selective in the nation, with a median LSAT score of 166, or the 91st percentile, for the entering class of 2022.

In 2024, the Times Higher Education ranked Allard the third-best law school within Canada, and the 37th in the world. 

At least five of Allard&#x27;s current faculty are former Rhodes scholars, with many more serving as former law clerks at the Supreme Court of Canada.

==Allard Hall==

The school is located at the University of British Columbia&#x27;s campus in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 2011 it moved out of its former building, a brutalist-style building with malfunctioning heating and cooling and into a new building that had recently been completed. The building cost around $56M; the university used $21M of its own funds and the rest came from donations, including $12M from The Law Foundation of B.C. In 2011 shortly before students and faculty began moving in, Peter Allard, an alumnus, donated about $12 million to the school, with about $10M of it going to complete the capital campaign; the building was named after him.

==Allard Prize for International Integrity==

The Allard Prize was established in 2012 and was initially funded by part of the 2011 gift from Allard and further funded by a subsequent $30M donation by Allard in 2015. The Allard Prize became independent of the Allard School of Law at the University of British Columbia on 21 June 2019.

The first prize was awarded in 2013, and it is given biennially to an individual, movement or organization that has &quot;demonstrated exceptional courage and leadership in combating corruption, especially through promoting transparency, accountability and the Rule of Law&quot;. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest prizes dedicated to the fight against corruption and protecting human rights.

The winner receives CAD$100,000 and an Allard Prize award which is an original work of art; Honourable Mention recipients receive an Allard Prize award and may be awarded a cash amount at the discretion of the Allard Prize Committee.

Many Allard Prize nominees and recipients have been, and continue to be, subjected to threats, violence, imprisonment and other attacks associated with their anti-corruption and human rights activities. One Honourable Mention recipient (Sergei Magnitsky) was nominated posthumously after being tortured and dying in a Russian prison.

<text>Psoy Galaktionovich Korolenko (; born April 26, 1967) is a pseudonym of a Russian songwriter and performer by the name of Pavel Eduardovich Lion (). Pavel Lion is also a slavist with a Ph.D. in Russian literature.

== Musical career ==
His pseudonym comes from Russian writer Vladimir Korolenko (1853–1921), whose works are a subject of Pavel&#x27;s research. In university, Korolenko studied under Russian literature historian , among others.

Psoy performs his own and others&#x27; songs, accompanying himself to keyboard instruments, mainly a Casio synthesizer in accordion timbre. Experimenting with quite various song traditions he sings in about six or seven languages, most frequently in Russian, Yiddish, English and French.

For example, one of Psoy&#x27;s songs, &quot;Buratino&quot;, is an a capella rhythmic recitation of the same phrase – &quot;Buratino byl tupoy&quot; (&quot;Buratino was dumb&quot;) – which after several repetitions starts to morph into other phrases, eventually shifting into Italian through syllable rearrangement. More phrases are then introduced and &quot;mixed&quot; vocally with it. The song is something of a parody of rap and trance music.

Psoy tours extensively beyond Russian borders, particularly in the United States, Europe and Israel. His music is popular both with adults (especially linguists) and teenagers. He rewrites many songs, and also has translated some songs from Russian to Yiddish. He has collaborated with musicians such as Julian Kytasty, Michael Alpert, and Daniel Kahn &amp; The Painted Bird. He has been involved in events celebrating Bundist organisations, such as playing music for the 120th anniversary of the Jewish Labour Bund in Melbourne, Australia.

<doc id="1239169" wikidata="Q623407" url="?curid=1239169" title="Numantia">
<text>Numantia () is an ancient Celtiberian settlement, whose remains are located on a hill known as Cerro de la Muela in the current municipality of Garray (Soria), Spain.

Numantia is famous for its role in the Celtiberian Wars. In 153 BC, Numantia experienced its first serious conflict with Rome. After twenty years of hostilities, in 133 BC the Roman Senate gave Scipio Aemilianus Africanus the task of destroying Numantia.

==History==


Numantia was an Iron Age hill fort (in Roman terminology an &quot;oppidum&quot;), which controlled a crossing of the river Duero. 
Pliny the Elder counts it as a city of the Pellendones, but other authors, like Strabo and Ptolemy place it among the Arevaci people. The Arevaci were a Celtiberian tribe, formed by the mingling of Iberians and migrating Celts in the 6th century BC, who inhabited an area near Numantia and Uxama.

The first serious conflict with Rome occurred in 153 BC when Quintus Fulvius Nobilior was consul. Numantia took in some fugitives from the city of Segeda, who belonged to another Celtiberian tribe called the Belli. The leader of the Belli, Carus of Segeda, managed to defeat a Roman army. The Romans then besieged Numantia, and deployed a small number of war elephants, but were unsuccessful.

In 137 BC, 20,000 Romans surrendered to the Celtiberians of Numantia (population between 4,000 and 8,000). The young Roman officer Tiberius Gracchus, as quaestor, saved the Roman army from destruction by signing a peace treaty with the Numantines, an action generally reserved for a legate.

The final siege of Numantia began in 134 BC. Scipio Aemilianus in command of an army of 30,000 soldiers laid siege to the city, erecting a 9 km barrier supported by towers, moats, impaling rods, and other devices. The Numantians refused to surrender and famine quickly spread through the city. After eight months most of the inhabitants decided to commit suicide rather than become slaves. A few hundred of the inhabitants decided to burn the city before surrendering after 13 months of siege.

===Later history===

After the destruction in 133 BC, occupation continued in the 1st century BC with a regular street plan but without great public buildings. Its decay started in the 3rd century, but was still settled in the 4th century.

Later remains from the 6th century hint of a Visigoth occupation.

==Excavation and conservation of Numantia==

Numantia&#x27;s exact location vanished from memory, and some theories placed it in Zamora, but in 1860 Eduardo Saavedra identified the correct location in Garray, Soria. In 1882, the ruins of Numantia were declared a national monument. In 1905, the German archaeologist Adolf Schulten began a series of excavations which located the Roman camps around the city. In 1999, the Roman camps were included in a &quot;zona arqueológica&quot;, a category of the Spanish heritage register which did not exist when the hillfort was first protected.
Regular excavations are still going on.

=== Museums ===

Many objects from the site are on display in the Numantine Museum of Soria (Spanish: &quot;Museo Numantino&quot;). This museum is also responsible for &quot;in situ&quot; displays at Numantia.

Other collections which have items from the site include the Romano-Germanic Central Museum, Mainz. (Some objects were taken by Adolf Schulten to Germany).

==Symbolism==
The Siege of Numantia was recorded by several Roman historians who admired the sense of freedom of the ancient Iberians and acknowledged their fighting skills against the Roman legions. 
=== In Spanish culture ===

Miguel de Cervantes (author of &quot;Don Quijote&quot;) wrote a play about the siege, &quot;El cerco de Numancia&quot;, which stands today as his best-known dramatic work.
Antonio Machado references the city in his poetry book &quot;Campos de Castilla&quot;. The poem is an ode to the countryside and peoples of rural Castile.
More recently, Carlos Fuentes wrote a short story about the event, &quot;The Two Numantias&quot;, in his collection &quot;The Orange Tree&quot;.

Several Spanish Navy ships have been named Numancia and a Sorian battalion was named &quot;batallón de numantinos&quot;. During the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalist Numancia regiment took the town of Azaña in Toledo.
To erase the memory of the Republican president Manuel Azaña, they renamed it Numancia de la Sagra.

The Sorian football team is called CD Numancia.

The expression &quot;numantine resistance&quot; is occasionally used to refer to particularly obdurate resistance.

<text>Leonard Charles &#x27;Len&#x27; Garry (born 6 January 1942) is an English musician, best known for being a member of The Quarrymen, a band who would later evolve into The Beatles.

== Childhood ==
Garry was born at 77 Lance Lane, Wavertree, Liverpool. His father, Henry, worked as a compositor at the Liverpool Daily Post, and his mother, Phyllis, was a housewife. His older brother, Walter, was born three years earlier. Garry attended Mosspits Lane Primary School, which included future Quarrymen members Pete Shotton and Nigel Walley, and briefly, John Lennon. Len learned how to play the piano as a child.

== The Quarrymen ==
=== 1957-1958 ===
In 1953, Garry was attending Liverpool Institute High School for Boys, when he met Ivan Vaughan. Vaughan would introduce Garry to Paul McCartney. The two briefly knew each other, as they were in the same German class. Two years later, Garry met John Lennon. In 1956, The Quarrymen was formed. The Quarrymen&#x27;s original tea-chest bassist, Bill Smith, stopped showing up for practices shortly after, and so, Len stepped in as the new tea-chest bassist for the Quarrymen. The group, consisting of John Lennon, Eric Griffiths, Pete Shotton, Garry, Colin Hanton, and Rod Davis, formed the first stable line-up of the group.

Garry performed with the group at two of their most historical performances, on Rosebery Street, on 22 June 1957, and at their first performance at The Cavern Club. Len remained for a few months, when he had to back out after falling severely ill with Tubercular meningitis. Garry, however, would not return to the group after returning: 

A few months after Len&#x27;s departure, the band recorded their first singles; That&#x27;ll Be the Day and In Spite of All the Danger. Garry was one of two members of the Quarrymen, who didn&#x27;t attend Quarry Bank High School (the latter of which the band was named after), the other being Nigel Walley. Garry was in the same room as John Lennon, when he and McCartney first met on 6 July 1957:
=== 1994-present ===
In 1997, Garry reunited with the then-surviving members of The Quarrymen to perform a concert, to commemorate 40 years since the group&#x27;s formation. Shortly after, they embarked on a tour which took place in the United Kingdom, United States, Germany, and Japan, among many others. Garry has participated on all Quarrymen releases since; including their three albums; &quot;Get Back – Together&quot; (1997), &quot;Songs We Remember&quot; (2004), and &quot;Grey Album&quot; (2012). Their recent material primarily consists of rock and roll and skiffle songs from the 1950s.

Garry was portrayed by actor Frazer Bird in the 2009 biopic Nowhere Boy.

The Quarrymen performed in New York City, for what would have been Lennon&#x27;s 70th birthday in 2010.

As of 2016, Garry still tours with founding member Colin Hanton and Rod Davis.

== Later life ==
As a young adult, Garry worked as in Architecture in Liverpool, and got married. In 1971, he and his wife migrated south to Chard, Somerset. During his time in Somerset, he fronted a rock gospel group called &quot;Come Together&quot;, and both of his daughters were born there. In 1987, he and his family migrated to New Zealand, although after a few months, they moved back to England, this time, they moved back to Liverpool, where he still lives today.

<text>Helen Watts (7 December 19277 October 2009) was a Welsh contralto.

==Early life==
Helen Josephine Watts was born in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, Wales. Her father was a pharmacist, Tom Watts and moved to live above his shop at 26 Market Street, Haverfordwest, Wales as a child. She was educated at Taskers School for Girls in Haverfordwest, the Abbots Bromley School for Girls, and at the Royal Academy of Music where she was taught voice by Caroline Hatchard.

==Career==
She began her career with the Glyndebourne Festival Chorus, and was a regular broadcaster on the Welsh Home Service. She subsequently had a distinguished career as an opera singer. She sang Bach arias at her debut at The Proms, in 1955. She toured the Soviet Union with the English Opera Group in 1964, singing the lead in &quot;The Rape of Lucretia&quot;. She was also known for her 1969 performances as Mistress Quickly in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; with the Welsh National Opera. In 1969, her voice was described by a critic as &quot;not particularly large, but the general purity and warmth of its tone gives it a direct, communicative power. And the singer uses it with taste and imagination.&quot;

The many recordings by Helen Watts included a &quot;monumental&quot; edition of forty Bach cantatas, with Helmuth Rilling conducting the Bach-Collegium Stuttgart. She also made several recordings as a soloist in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, various roles in Wagner&#x27;s Ring cycle, and an album of Welsh songs with the Treorchy male voice choir.

She was asked to choose her favourite record, book, and luxury as a guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 1970. They were:
* favourite track: Betrachte Meine Seele, from the &quot;St John Passion&quot; by Johann Sebastian Bach; book: Illustrated book on gardening; luxury: Diego Velázquez&#x27;s The Maids of Honour, (&quot;Las Meninas&quot;) in the Prado.

In 1978, she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

==Personal life==
Helen Watts married Michael Mitchell, a viola player with the London Symphony Orchestra, in 1980. Mitchell died in 2007.
Watts died on 7 October 2009 at the age of 81.

<doc id="1239190" wikidata="Q741535" url="?curid=1239190" title="Larry Lloyd">
<text>Laurence Valentine Lloyd (6 October 1948 – 28 March 2024) was an English professional football player and coach.

A defender, he won domestic and European honours for both Bill Shankly&#x27;s Liverpool and Brian Clough&#x27;s Nottingham Forest in the 1970s. He was also an England international.

==Playing career==

===Early years===
Lloyd started playing local football with Henbury Old Boys before being signed by Bristol Rovers. He made his debut on 10 August 1968 at Eastville in a 1–1 draw against Watford.

===Liverpool===
Rovers accepted a £50,000 bid for Lloyd on 22 April 1969 with manager Bill Shankly looking for a long-term successor to ageing skipper and defender Ron Yeats. Lloyd broke into the team later that year, making his debut on 27 September in a league game at The Hawthorns. Liverpool drew 2–2 with West Bromwich Albion. By the following year Lloyd was a regular as Shankly underwent a major rebuilding of the side, finding more new players of Lloyd&#x27;s age.

Lloyd partnered one of the players who survived the Shankly cull, captain Tommy Smith. The pair were at the heart of the defence that took Liverpool to the 1971 FA Cup final, losing 2–1 after extra time to newly crowned league champions Arsenal.

Sir Alf Ramsey gave Lloyd his international debut on 19 May 1971 in a British Home Championship match against Wales. The game was played at Wembley and finished 0–0. Lloyd&#x27;s club teammates Chris Lawler, Emlyn Hughes and Smith all started the game.

1972 saw Lloyd score his first goal for the Reds. It came in the 3–0 league win over Manchester City at Anfield on 26 February. His goal was the first of the 3 and came in the 37th minute. Kevin Keegan (53rd) and Bobby Graham (65th) completed the scoring.

Liverpool won the League and UEFA Cup double in 1973. Lloyd did not miss a single minute of the 54 matches played in the whole season. He scored in the first leg of the UEFA Cup final helping Liverpool to a 3–2 aggregate victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach. The following year he suffered an injury losing his place to the young Phil Thompson and missed out on victory in the FA Cup final against Newcastle United.

Shankly quit that summer. successor Bob Paisley preferred Thompson and Lloyd transferred to Coventry City.

===Coventry City===
On 15 August 1974, Coventry under manager, Gordon Milne, paid a club record transfer fee for Lloyd. His form suffered after he was injured and he moved on to Nottingham Forest in December 1976. He had played 54 games for Coventry, scoring six goals.

===Nottingham Forest===
In 1976 Brian Clough, acting on Peter Taylor&#x27;s advice, snapped up Lloyd for £60,000 after an initial loan period. Forest were chasing promotion to the top flight in English football. He made his Forest debut on 2 October in a league match against Hull City. Forest lost 1–0 away at Boothferry Park. It did not prevent Lloyd going on to win promotion with Forest that season. They won the League title the next season, and also won the League Cup final, against Lloyd&#x27;s former club, Liverpool.

In 1979, Lloyd and Forest won the European Cup and retained the League Cup.

In the 1979–80 League Cup they reached the final for the third season running but lost to Wolverhampton Wanderers.

In June 1979, Lloyd represented the League of Ireland XI as a guest player in a tour of Asia, scoring twice in a 4–1 win over Singapore.

In 1980, Forest retained their European crown.

==International career==
Lloyd made four appearances for England in an international career which spanned over eight years. He made his debut on 19 May 1971 under the managership of Alf Ramsey in a Home Championship game against Wales which ended in a 0–0 draw. He made two further appearances, against Switzerland and Northern Ireland in 1971 and 1972 but was not picked again until 17 May 1980. Now under the managership of Ron Greenwood, Lloyd was picked to play against Wales again in the Home Championship. This was his last international appearance as England lost 4–1 to Wales at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham.

==Coaching career==
===Wigan Athletic===
Lloyd left Forest for Wigan Athletic in March 1981, where he was player-manager taking over from Ian McNeill. In 1981–82, he guided them to promotion from the Fourth Division, in only their fourth season as a Football League team. The following season, Lloyd oversaw their survival in the Third Division.

===Notts County===
Lloyd&#x27;s success as Wigan attracted the attention of Notts County, who were looking for a new first team manager after Jimmy Sirrel &quot;moved upstairs&quot;. However, after Lloyd&#x27;s only season at Meadow Lane he left the club after relegation ended their three-year stay in the First Division, being sacked on 21 October 1984.

== Personal life ==
Up until 2000 Lloyd was a regular and outspoken pundit for Nottingham-based local radio, firstly on GEM AM and latterly on Century 106, covering Forest matches. He lived in Spain for many years, where he had a number of bars and dealt in property sales. He was involved in football as manager of amateur side Real Marbella. 

In 2001 after falling on hard times, Lloyd took the decision to sell his European competition medals raising £12,000 from a sale at Christie&#x27;s. He regretted selling the medals which he claimed was forced on him by his financial position.

In 2008 Lloyd&#x27;s autobiography titled &quot;Hard Man, Hard Game&quot; was published.

In 2021, he returned to the UK to live in Nottinghamshire. Lloyd died on 28 March 2024, at the age of 75.

<text>Teresa M. Bergeson (born October 5, 1942) is a former three-term Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

==Biography==
Dr. Bergeson graduated from Emmanuel College in 1964 with a B.A. in English. In 1969, she earned a master&#x27;s degree in counseling and guidance from Western Michigan University. She earned her doctoral degree from the University of Washington.

Bergeson worked as a counselor at Lincoln High School in Tacoma, Washington, and as a teacher and guidance counselor in Massachusetts and Alaska. During this period Bergeson served as chair of the National Education Association&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Caucus and implemented their National Women&#x27;s Leadership Training Project. In 1981 Bergeson was elected vice-president of the Washington Education Association, and in 1985 she was elected president.

In 1989, she was hired as an executive director in the Central Kitsap School District where she had a supervisory role over 9 of the 21 schools in the district. From 1993 to 1996, Bergeson was the executive director of the Washington State Commission on Student Learning, in which capacity she led the development of statewide standards for students, as well as the Washington Assessment of Student Learning.

In 1996, Bergeson launched her first successful bid for the non-partisan office of Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction. She was re-elected in 2000 and 2004. As superintendent Bergeson led further development of statewide standards and standardized tests, particularly after the Commission on Student Learning was dissolved in 1999.

In 2008, Bergeson was defeated in her run for a fourth term as Superintendent of Public Instruction by challenger Randy Dorn.

<doc id="1239203" wikidata="Q5378620" url="?curid=1239203" title="English pleasure">
<text>&quot;English pleasure&quot; is the generic term for a number of different English riding classes seen at horse shows in the United States, where the horse is ridden in either hunt seat or saddle seat tack.

In the average English pleasure class, the horses perform as a group, exhibiting the natural gaits of the walk, trot, and canter, and may also be asked to extend the trot or to perform a hand gallop. Horses are judged on their manners, performance, quality and conformation. The horse is to give the impression of being a pleasure to ride.

In the show hunter and hunt seat world, pleasure-type classes where the horses are not to jump are sometimes referred to as &quot;flat&quot; classes or &quot;Hunter under saddle.&quot; In a variation on the pleasure class known as Hunter hack, riders may also be asked to have their horses jump two low jumps and back up. Show hack classes do not require jumping, but instead ask the horse to perform collected, regular, and extended versions of the walk, trot and canter, plus the hand gallop, usually attired in Dressage style equipment. In American Saddlebred breed competition, pleasure classes for five-gaited horses are sometimes offered, and at shows for &quot;gaited&quot; breeds such as the Tennessee Walker and the Missouri Fox Trotter, English pleasure classes substitute the breed&#x27;s particular ambling gait for the trot.

The horse is usually ridden on contact with the rein, and the horse is penalized if it must be ridden on strong contact, gapes its mouth, does not respond willingly to light aids, or does not travel in balance. The horse should move straight, with a steady rhythm and a free and flowing stride. The horse should not come behind the bit, or travel too fast.

Hunter type movement (long and low) is preferred for hunter style horses. High action is preferred for English pleasure horses ridden saddle seat.

When showing in an English Pleasure or Hunt Seat class, the rider must be wearing the proper attire. This includes an English style jacket. The jacket can be different colors, depending on the style of riding. Most jackets are a dark grey, navy blue, or black. Underneath the coat the rider must have a collared shirt. Some shows and different events allow colored shirts, but the standard is a white or neutral color. The shirt can be either long or short sleeved. The rider must wear breeches. Depending on the show and event, the color of the breeches can vary from different shades of tan, gray, or white. English boots are also a requirement. Spurs are optional. Another requirement of the rider&#x27;s attire is a helmet, or hunt cap. The style can vary depending on the event. Some styles of riding also require gloves to be worn, but for others gloves are optional.

<text>Jeffrey Harold Loria (born November 20, 1940) is an American entrepreneur, author, and the former owner of the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals) and Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.

==Early life==
Loria was born and raised in a Jewish family in Manhattan, the son of Ruth (Ost) and Walter J. Loria, a lawyer. Loria took an early interest in baseball, attending his first New York Yankees game in the late 1940s. Loria attended New York City&#x27;s Stuyvesant High School and Yale University, where he initially took pre-med courses. With a requirement to take a history class, Loria chose art history.

After college, he worked in a newly established art-buying program for Sears, launched with the help of actor Vincent Price. In 1965, at the age of 24, he opened his business, Jeffrey H. Loria &amp; Co., on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side and wrote a book, &quot;Collecting Original Art&quot;. He specializes in 20th-century masters, and his collection includes works by Pablo Picasso and Henry Moore. Loria graduated from Columbia Business School in 1968 and published his second book, &quot;What&#x27;s It All About Charlie Brown?&quot;. Co-written with Pat K. Lynch, it is a look at life through the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip.

==Montreal Expos==
In 1989, Loria purchased the Oklahoma City 89ers, then a Triple-A affiliate of the Texas Rangers. The team won the American Association championship in 1992. Loria sold the team in 1993 and began looking to buy a Major League team. He lost out to Peter Angelos in his bid to purchase the Baltimore Orioles in 1994.

On December 9, 1999, he bought a 24 percent stake in the Montreal Expos for $18 million CAD (approximately $12 million USD) and became the managing general partner. He&#x27;d initially considered buying the team in 1991 from founding owner Charles Bronfman, but Bronfman balked at Loria&#x27;s demand for a controlling interest and the team was subsequently sold to then-team president Claude Brochu instead. Loria headed an ownership group that included the city of Montreal, several Montreal businesses, and Stephen Bronfman, Charles&#x27; son. When a series of cash calls over the next two years went unanswered, Loria ended up with 93 percent of the team at a valuation of US$50 million.

One of Loria&#x27;s first acts was to reiterate demands for a new park for the Expos to replace Olympic Stadium, of which he bluntly said, &quot;We cannot stay here.&quot; He lost a considerable amount of goodwill with Expos fans when the team was not able to reach an agreement for television and English-speaking radio coverage during the 2000 season, as the Expos tried to increase their revenue from broadcast rights. He also sought more public funding for a planned downtown ballpark, Labatt Park. However, the provincial and municipal governments balked at committing more money to the project. Premier Lucien Bouchard said that he could not support using public funds to build ballparks when the province was being forced to shut down hospitals. Additionally, Bouchard did not like that Olympic Stadium still had not been paid for 25 years after being built, and ultimately wouldn&#x27;t be paid for until 2006.

===Sale of the Expos===
In 2002, as part of an orchestrated move with Bud Selig and then-Marlins owner John W. Henry, Loria sold the Expos to a partnership of the other 29 major league clubs for $120million. In effect, the Expos were sold to the commissioner&#x27;s office (being owned by the league). Henry then sold the Marlins to Loria for $158.5million, including a $38.5million no-interest loan from MLB. The deal was approved by the other owners before Loria and Henry signed the contract, and paved the way for Henry to buy the Boston Red Sox. Loria moved the Expos&#x27; entire front office staff, on-field staff, office equipment and computer equipment to Florida. MLB&#x27;s plans to contract the Expos and Minnesota Twins failed, as the Twins were compelled to fulfill the terms of their lease at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome.

Loria&#x27;s partners in the Expos ownership consortium filed a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) lawsuit against Loria and Major League Baseball, eventually going to arbitration, with the arbitration panel finding in favor of Loria. The Expos were ultimately transferred to Washington, D.C., as the Nationals. While the move was welcomed by baseball fans in Washington, it has led to many bitter feelings among Montreal – as well as Canadian – baseball fans. Many speculate that Loria never intended to keep the team in Montreal. The feelings among some Canadian baseball fans are so strong that, in 2011, when Loria chose Remembrance Day to announce his team&#x27;s new name and stadium, Richard Griffin, a well-known Canadian baseball columnist wrote:

:It&#x27;s ironic that Loria and the Marlins held their celebration in Miami on Remembrance Day because there&#x27;s a generation of fans north of the border that will never forget (about how Loria&#x27;s actions led to the Expos leaving town).

==Florida/Miami Marlins==
Shortly after selling the Expos, Loria officially became owner of the Marlins on February 12, 2002. Loria won his first World Series as an owner in his second full season in Florida, as the Marlins beat the Yankees four games to two in the World Series.

In 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; evaluated the current value for the Miami Marlins at around $520 million. As of May 12, 2009, the Marlins were 569–564 under Loria. On November 11, 2011, the Florida Marlins officially rebranded themselves the Miami Marlins with a new logo, uniform, and color scheme.

The franchise, which previously paid rent at Sun Life Stadium, had been trying for years to finance a new retractable roof ballpark. The City of Miami and Miami-Dade County both voted to approve construction of a new baseball stadium for the Marlins. Marlins Park is located in the area formerly occupied by the Miami Orange Bowl football stadium. Construction was completed by opening day 2012. Before the stadium deal was in place, the team shed star players to pare down payroll to among baseball&#x27;s lowest in 2006, and was given permission to explore options for relocating. The team then worked with the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County, in a public/private partnership, to build the 37,000 seat ballpark.

A deal with the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County was eventually approved and the Marlins agreed to contribute $155 million toward the construction of a new retractable roof stadium. They were also made responsible for any cost overruns for the stadium, set in the Little Havana section of Miami. Financing for the facility was completed with tourist bed taxes and funds reserved specifically for convention centers and sporting facilities. The deal required taxpayer general funds to compensate all cost overruns, but the facility was completed on-time and under budget. The Marlins receive 100% of all revenues from the stadium, but must pay all costs associated with operating the facility. The first Major League Baseball game in the new stadium was against the St. Louis Cardinals on April 4, 2012.

Following a disappointing season in which the Marlins finished last in their division, the Marlins completed a 12-player trade on November 19, 2012, with the Toronto Blue Jays as part of an effort to pare down the team&#x27;s payroll. This led local and national sportswriters, as well as Marlins fans, to criticize Loria&#x27;s stated intentions of building a competitive team. Much of the controversy stemmed from the demands on local government to fund much of the construction at Marlins Park. Although the Marlins faced the threat of boycotts during the 2013 season from local residents, politicians, and sportswriters, Loria defended the November 2012 trade with the Blue Jays. He claimed that despite the Marlins&#x27; hefty payroll in 2012, the fans did not sell out the facility as imagined and that the organization was not winning and needed to &quot;take a new course&quot; in order to do so.

In April 2013, Loria reportedly had Ricky Nolasco and José Fernández switch the games of a doubleheader in which they were scheduled to pitch, violating clubhouse protocol. In July 2013, hitting coach Tino Martinez, who had been handpicked by Loria, resigned following allegations that he verbally and physically assaulted players, including Chris Valaika. When the organization considered promoting Valaika to the majors in August after Plácido Polanco was placed on the disabled list, Loria vetoed the transaction, and the team promoted Gil Velazquez instead.

Loria had been called &quot;baseball&#x27;s most hated man&quot;, its &quot;worst owner&quot;, and even one of the &quot;worst owner(s) in sports history&quot;. He is a &quot;widely despised&quot; figure in South Florida; in 2012, a &quot;Miami Herald&quot; poll found him with a six percent favorability rating among Marlins fans and Major League Baseball fans in South Florida.

Loria sold the team in 2017 to a group led by Bruce Sherman.

==Political controversy==
In February 2017, it was reported that Loria had been in negotiations to sell the Marlins to the family of Jared Kushner, son-in-law of Donald Trump, and that the parties came to &quot;a handshake deal&quot;. At the same time, the first Trump administration was working to name Loria the United States ambassador to France. In response, Kushner announced that his family would not buy the club if Loria was appointed to the position. Neither the appointment nor the deal ultimately occurred.

==Personal life==
In 1980, he married Sivia Samson (divorced from attorney Allen Samson); they divorced in 2005. His stepson, David Samson, served as the Marlins team president until September 2017. In 2007, Loria married Julie Lavin Loria.

Loria still runs his art dealership, and is an honorary member of the board of overseers of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University in New York. He formerly served on the board of the Art Dealers Association of America. Loria divides his time between homes in New York and South Florida.

<doc id="1239212" wikidata="Q250496" url="?curid=1239212" title="Elections in Romania">
<text>Romania elects on a national level a head of state – the president – and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people (after a change from four-year terms after the 2004 election). The Romanian Parliament () has two chambers. The Chamber of Deputies () has currently 330 members (after the last legislative elections), elected for a four-year term by party-list proportional representation on closed lists. The Senate () has currently 136 members (after the last legislative elections), elected for a four-year term by party-list proportional representation on closed lists.

Romania has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.

On 25 November 2007, for the first time, Romanians elected their representatives to the European Parliament.

In a controversial move, on 6 December 2024, the Constitutional Court annulled the results of the first round of the presidential election. 

== Electoral system ==

=== President ===
The President is elected in a two-round system for a five-year term. Candidates obtaining a majority of 50%+1 of all registered voters in the first round are declared the winner. If none of the candidates achieve this, then a run-off is held between the two contenders with the top scores in the first round. The candidate who obtains any majority of votes in the run-off is declared the winner.

The term of the president is five years. Between 1992 and 2004 the term was of four years, but was increased following the 2003 Constitutional referendum. One person can serve a maximum of two terms, that may be consecutive.

In order to be able to run for the Office of President a candidate must fulfill the following conditions: be a Romanian citizen, be at least 35 years of age (at least on the day of the election), and not have held the office for two terms since 1992, when the 1991 Constitution took effect.

=== Parliament ===
The Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are elected in constituencies, by universal, equal, direct, secret, and freely expressed suffrage, on the basis of a list system and independent candidatures, according to the principle of closed party list proportional representation. The option for an identical election system of the two Chambers of Parliament confers them the same legitimacy, as both of them are the expression of the will of the same electoral body.

The two Chambers have different numbers of members: the Chamber of Deputies is composed of 330 Deputies, and the Senate of 136 Senators. This differentiation is possible owing to the legal provision of a representation norm differing from one Chamber to the other and due to the seats allotted to the national minorities (a seat in the Chamber of Deputies for each minority) and to the Romanians living abroad (4 seats in the Chamber and 2 in the Senate). Thus, for the election of the Chamber of Deputies the representation norm is of one Deputy to 73,000 inhabitants, and for the election of the Senate, of one Senator to 168,000 inhabitants.

The number of Deputies and Senators to be elected in each constituency is determined on the basis of the representation norm, by relating the number of inhabitants in each constituency to the representation norm. There are 43 constituencies: 1 for each county and the Municipality of Bucharest, and 1 for the Romanians living abroad. In a constituency, the number of Deputies cannot be less than four, and that of Senators, less than two. The number of inhabitants taken into account is that existing on 1 January of the previous year, published in the &quot;Statistical Yearbook of Romania&quot;. If, at least five months before the election date, a general census has taken place, the number of inhabitants taken into account is that resulting from the census.

The electoral threshold is for parties or candidates running individually 5% on national level or 20% in at least 4 constituencies, and 8-10% for coalitions or electoral alliances.

The Constitution of Romania and the Election Law grant to legally constituted organizations of citizens belonging to national minorities, in case these could not obtain at the election at least one Deputy or Senator mandate, the right to a Deputy mandate, if they have obtained throughout the country a number of votes equal to at least 5% out of the average number of votes validly expressed throughout the country for the election of one Deputy.

The mandates assigned, under the conditions of the Election Law, to organizations of citizens belonging to national minorities are added to the Deputy mandates resulted from the representation norm.

=== European Parliament ===
To elect the 33 MEPs (35 MEPs between 2007 and 2009, 32 between 2014 and 2019), Romania is considered a single constituency. The system used is closed party list proportional representation, with a 5% threshold of the votes.

=== Local elections ===
To elect the mayors the first past the post is used since 2012. The candidate who wins most of the votes is declared elected. A runoff is organised if the top two candidates have an equal number of votes.

For the office of Presidents of the County Councils, between 2008 and 2012, and again since 2024, the first pass the post system was used. Until 2008 and again since 2016, the County Council Presidents have been indirectly elected by each County Council.

To elect the Local, and County Councils, the closed party list proportional representation, with a 5% threshold of the votes at the constituency level (city, commune or county).

== Voting procedures ==
Irrespective of the type of election, the vote is done by using paper and manual counting. The voter is required to prove his/hers identity using the Identity card (or the previous version, the &quot;Identity bulletin&quot;), or, for special reasons, the military ID or the passport. After (s)he signs in the permanent, supplemental, or special electoral list, (s)he is handed a voting ballot (&quot;buletin de vot&quot;) and a stamp that reads VOTAT YYYY TTT (voted); YYYY stands for the year the election is held, and TTT for the type of elections to be held: L for local elections (including partial), P presidential elections, PE for European Parliament election, R for referendums (R.V.U. was used in 2007). For the general election, up to now, there was no additional type indicator, as it is granted most importance.

For the local and parliamentary elections, the voter can vote only at the polling station where (s)he has the permanent address (&quot;domiciliu&quot;), or the temporary residence (&quot;flotant&quot;) at least three months old. For the local election, the Romanians outside Romania cannot vote. For the parliamentary election they vote the candidates for the 43rd constituency. For the European Parliament and presidential elections the voters can vote at a different pooling station than the local and parliamentary elections, but only if (s)he is not in the home-town the voting day. Since the 2016 legislative election the Romanian electors residing abroad will be able to cast their vote via mail.

The voting ballot is printed on newspaper paper, monochrome. All the candidates (or the full candidate list) are listed in a lottery type established order (first the parliamentary parties, than the non-parliamentary parties, and at the end, the independent candidates), each in a clearly designated rectangular that consists of the full party/alliance name and logo, and the full candidate name (or full list of candidates&#x27; names). Voters express their choice by stamping the rectangle of the party or independent candidate (s)he wishes to vote for. For referendums the same voting procedure is used. Each of the two options (YES – &quot;DA&quot; and NO – &quot;NU&quot;) are in a 5×5 cm square, YES on top and NO at the bottom, and the question voted for in the middle of the voting ballot.

The Social Democratic Party (PSD) won the general election with a little bit over 29% of the seats in both houses of Parliament, but remained in opposition. PNL, USR-PLUS, and UDMR forming a coalition government.

This election saw the return of the county (and Bucharest) level lists, replacing the previous mixed member election. In addition, it also maintained special seats for Romanians living abroad (i.e. the Romanian diaspora), in both houses.

<text>Thermofluids is a branch of science and engineering encompassing four intersecting fields:
*Heat transfer
*Thermodynamics
*Fluid mechanics
*Combustion

The term is a combination of &quot;thermo&quot;, referring to heat, and &quot;fluids&quot;, which refers to liquids, gases and vapors. Temperature, pressure, equations of state, and transport laws all play an important role in thermofluid problems. Phase transition and chemical reactions may also be important in a thermofluid context. The subject is sometimes also referred to as &quot;thermal fluids&quot;.

==Heat transfer==
Heat transfer is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the transfer of thermal energy from one physical system to another. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as heat conduction, convection, thermal radiation, and phase-change transfer. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species, either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer. 

Sections include :
*Energy transfer by heat, work and mass
*Laws of thermodynamics
*Entropy
*Refrigeration Techniques
*Properties and nature of pure substances

===Applications===
*Engineering : Predicting and analysing the performance of machines

==Thermodynamics==
Thermodynamics is the science of energy conversion involving heat and other forms of energy, most notably mechanical work. It studies and interrelates the macroscopic variables, such as temperature, volume and pressure, which describe physical, thermodynamic systems.

==Fluid mechanics==
Fluid Mechanics the study of the physical forces at work during fluid flow. Fluid mechanics can be divided into fluid kinematics, the study of fluid motion, and fluid kinetics, the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion. Fluid mechanics can further be divided into fluid statics, the study of fluids at rest, and fluid dynamics, the study of fluids in motion. Some of its more interesting concepts include momentum and reactive forces in fluid flow and fluid machinery theory and performance.

Sections include:
*Fluid flow and continuity
*Momentum in fluids
*Static and dynamic forces on a boundary
*Laminar and turbulent flow
*Metacentric height and vessel stability

===Applications===
*Pump Design.
*Hydro-Electric Power Generation.
*Naval Architecture.

==Combustion==
Combustion is the sequence of exothermic chemical reactions between a fuel and an oxidant accompanied by the production of heat and conversion of chemical species. The release of heat can result in the production of light in the form of either glowing or a flame. Fuels of interest often include organic compounds (especially hydrocarbons) in the gas, liquid or solid phase.

<text>Eric Todd Piatkowski (; born September 30, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Nebraska Cornhuskers. He is the son of former ABA player Walt Piatkowski.

==High school career==
Piatkowski attended Rapid City Stevens High School and was a student and a standout in basketball. In basketball, as a senior, he led his team to the 1989 South Dakota Class AA State Championship, was an All-State selection, and was named the Mr. Basketball for the State of South Dakota.

==College career==
Piatkowski played at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln for coach Danny Nee from 1990 to 1994. He was a member of the All Big Eight Freshman team in 1991 and was honorable mention All Big Eight his freshman and sophomore seasons. Piatkowski was a first team All-Big Eight pick by the Associated Press his junior year and averaged a team high 16.7 points per game. He averaged 21.5 points per game his senior season and was named to the All Big Eight team again. He also led the Cornhuskers to the Big Eight Conference Tournament Championship game while scoring a collegiate high and NU single game record 42 points against Oklahoma in the semi-finals. They went on to defeat Oklahoma State in the finals and he secured tournament MVP honors. That helped earn them the sixth seed in the NCAA Tournament. However Piatkowski&#x27;s team lost to the eleventh seeded Penn Quakers in the opening round. He was recognized as an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press and finished his collegiate career with 1,934 career points, behind only Dave Hoppen for the most in school history. His jersey at Nebraska (No. 52) was retired in 2006.

==NBA career==
After completing his eligibility at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Piatkowski was drafted by the Indiana Pacers with the 15th pick of the 1994 NBA draft. The Pacers immediately dealt his draft rights, along with Pooh Richardson and Malik Sealy, to the Los Angeles Clippers for Mark Jackson and the draft rights to Greg Minor. He ended his Clipper career as the franchise leader in games played (616), 3-point field goals made (738) and 3-point field goal attempts (1,835) and free throw percentage (.880%).

After nine seasons with the Clippers he signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Houston Rockets before the 2003–04 season. Piatkowski became a Bull on September 8, 2004, when Houston sent him, Adrian Griffin and Mike Wilks to Chicago in exchange for Dikembe Mutombo.
On July 13, 2006, Piatkowski officially signed with the Phoenix Suns, agreeing on a two-year, $2.4 million deal. In April 2014 Piatkowski&#x27;s group was attempting to buy the L.A. Clippers from embattled owner Donald T Sterling, before Steve Ballmer bought the team outright.

==Career highlights and trivia==
*He played for the US in the World Basketball games in 1993.
*On February 16, 2002, he set a career high of 36 points against the Dallas Mavericks.
*He set the Clippers individual season record for three-point percentage at .466 which ranked him third in the NBA that season. (2001-02)
*Nicknamed &quot;Pike&quot; and &quot;The Polish Rifle&quot; for his surname and three-point shooting accuracy.
*The first third generation pro basketball player, his dad Walt played four seasons, and grandad Joe played in the 1950s.
*Holds three L.A. Clippers all time records, free throw percentage, three point shooting percentage and most games played for the franchise in L.A.
*Had his number 52 retired by the University of Nebraska.
*Beginning in the 2008–2009 season, Piatkowski became the color analyst on Fox Sports Midwest for the Nebraska men&#x27;s basketball team.

<doc id="1239229" wikidata="Q1247041" url="?curid=1239229" title="Michele Santoro">
<text>Michele Santoro (born 2 July 1951) is an Italian journalist, television host and presenter.

He also served till October 2005 as Member of the European Parliament for Southern Italy with the United in the Olive Tree list, part of the Socialist Group and sat on the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, being a substitute for the Committee on Culture and Education, a member of the Delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and a substitute for the Delegation to the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee.

==Education and career==
Santoro was born in Salerno.

A graduate in philosophy, he made a successful debut in the Italian media as editor-in-chief on the regional newspaper &quot;La Voce della Campania&quot; (&quot;Voice of Campania&quot;) and collaborating with some other national newspapers and magazines like &quot;Il Mattino&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Unità&quot; and &quot;Epoca&quot;.

Before being hired by RAI, he had had some experience with a number of radio stations. He started his RAI career in TG3, the Rai 3 news division, first as a foreign correspondent, then creating and producing TV specials and weekly TV magazines, and finally working as chief culture correspondent, again for TG3.

===News shows===
Santoro&#x27;s popularity was essentially based on being the author and anchorman for TV journalism broadcasts like &quot;Samarcanda&quot;, &quot;Il rosso e il nero&quot; and &quot;Temporeale&quot;, all strongly left-wing oriented, the broadcasts took place during a period of political turmoil in Italy, such as Mani pulite. These often involved debates with politicians, along with ground-breaking reports and questions from the audience. Santoro&#x27;s shows were seen as places where the Italian people confronted their politicians, often perceived to be corrupt or inept. His shows have always been criticized for the leftism and lack of impartiality like in the last years with attacks against Berlusconi and other right wing Italian MPs.

Santoro left RAI in 1996, because of disagreements with the public television&#x27;s direction, and briefly worked in Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s networks; he left Mediaset because of Berlusconi&#x27;s continuing political role that he felt to be in conflict with his influence as the country&#x27;s main media entrepreneur. After his return, he led two shows, &quot;Circus&quot;, on Rai 1, and &quot;Sciuscià&quot;, on Rai 2. The latter was often made up of a series of reportages, narrated in movie style.

In recent years he has been continually accused of partisanship by the right-wing coalition House of Freedoms led by Berlusconi, whose family holding company controls Mediaset, who installed a new board in the state-owned RAI after their electoral victory in the 2001 Italian general election. &quot;Sciuscià&quot; remained on the air until May 2002.

=== Attacks from Berlusconi ===
The new RAI board installed by the centre-right government decided not to renew Santoro&#x27;s contract. This followed a declaration by Silvio Berlusconi, then prime minister of Italy, at a press conference in Sofia, Bulgaria, where he stated: &quot;Santoro, Biagi and Luttazzi used the public TV, paid by all, in a manner which is criminal. I believe it to be a specific duty of the new RAI board not to allow this to happen again.&quot;

Soon after, neither Santoro nor the two others obtained any more work for RAI, and working for Berlusconi&#x27;s own TV networks (the other half of the TV system) was obviously unviable. A legal dispute has been ongoing, since Santoro contested a violation of his contract by RAI. He was supported by a court decision that should have forced RAI to give him the direction of a news magazine, but in the end Santoro was omitted.

== European Parliament candidate ==
In the 2004 European elections, Santoro accepted the offer of candidacy proposed by the centre-left confederation called United in the Olive Tree. He was elected as MEP with a great poll success, obtaining a total of more 700,000 votes in Italy as a whole. In the southern-Italian mandate, Santoro defeated Silvio Berlusconi himself with 526,535 votes against 452,326.

Michele Santoro resigned as an MEP on 19 October 2005, basing his decision on his desire to go back to his work on RAI, citing a judicial verdict which obliged the Italian national television to reinstate him. Contemporarily he announced his participation on &quot;RockPolitik&quot;, a controversial and long-awaited TV show on Rai 1, hosted by singer Adriano Celentano, to talk about issues of media censorship, after Luttazzi and Biagi refused to be guests on the show.

== Return to RAI and later years ==

Following his resignation from the European Parliament, he started working on a new TV news magazine called &quot;AnnoZero&quot; (Year Zero) broadcast on Rai 2 and Rai Extra and initially scheduled to be aired first on 27 April 2006; its debut was however delayed and it started on 14 September. The show&#x27;s regular commentators consist of the journalist Marco Travaglio and the cartoonist Vauro. The episode of the show aired on 8 March 2007, which featured Italian Minister of Justice Clemente Mastella as special guest, caused controversy for his strong position on the DiCo issue. Mastella walked out of the programme in protest during its live broadcast.

At the end of 2011, Santoro did not renew his agreement with RAI and LA7 and decided to establish a TV magazine with distribution on local TV channels and live internet streaming. Later, he signed an agreement with Sky TG24.

In 2012, he returned to LA7 with a new political talk show named &quot;Servizio Pubblico&quot;. On 10 January 2013, together with Marco Travaglio, he hosted Silvio Berlusconi in an episode of his show that became the most viewed emission in the history of LA7. He hosted the show until 2015.

In 2016, Santoro briefly returned to RAI with a new talk show titled &quot;Italia&quot; for six episodes.

== European election of 2024 ==
In 2024, after having organized a number of &quot;peace-related&quot; events in support of Italy reducing its political involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian War, Santoro presented a new political list named Peace Land Dignity, composed of several minor left-wing parties and independent members. The list participated in the 2024 European Parliament election in Italy but failed to win any seats.

<text>The Independent Spirit Awards, originally known as the FINDIE or Friends of Independents Awards, and later as the Film Independent Spirit Awards, are awards presented annually in Santa Monica, California, to independent filmmakers. Founded in 1984, the event was renamed the Independent Spirit Awards in 1986. The ceremony is produced by Film Independent, a not-for-profit arts organization that used to produce the LA Film Festival. Film Independent members vote to determine the winners of the Spirit Awards.

The awards show is held in a tent on a beach in Santa Monica, California, historically on the Saturday before the Academy Awards. In 2023, the ceremony was moved to the week before the Oscars, with the expectation that its winners could influence the final days of Oscar voting. The show was previously broadcast live on the IFC network in the US until 2023, when it was moved to YouTube, as well as Hollywood Suite in Canada and A&amp;E Latin America. Winners were previously presented with acrylic glass pyramids containing suspended shoestrings representing the bare budgets of independent films. Since 2006, winners receive a metal trophy depicting a bird with its wings spread sitting atop of a pole with the shoestrings from the previous design wrapped around the pole. 

In 2020, new categories were announced for the 36th Independent Spirit Awards, which would honor the best in television productions and performances. These categories included Best New Scripted Series, Best New Non-Scripted or Documentary Series, Best Male Performance, Best Female Performance, and Best Ensemble Cast. In 2022, it was announced that gender neutral acting categories would be implemented and that the previous gendered film categories — Male Lead, Female Lead, Male Supporting and Female Supporting — would be retired in favor of a Best Lead Performance and a Best Supporting Performance categories, which would feature 10 nominees each. Other new categories added included Best Breakthrough Performance and Best Lead and Supporting Performance in the TV section.

, films competing for Independent Spirit Awards must have budgets lower than $28 million, but no budget cap exists for television shows.

==History==
The Independent Features Project/West was founded by Gregory Nava and Anna Thomas.

In 1984 the FINDIE Awards (Friends of Independents) were conceived by Independent Features Project/West board member Jeanne Lucas and Independent Features Project/West President Anne Kimmel and director/writer Sam O&#x27;Brien was an event producer. The awards are voted on by a nominating committee.

In 1985, Peter Coyote and Jamie Lee Curtis presented winners with a Plexiglas pyramid designed by Carol Bosselman, which contain a suspended shoestring, printed with sprocket holes, representing the shoestring budgets of independent films. The Reel Gold Award, also designed by Bosselman, was given to Steve Wachtel for allowing Independent Features Project/West continuing free use of his screening room. It was associated with Filmex. In 1986, Bosselman designed and sculpted the Independent Spirit Award statue that is still given out today, using a lost wax bronze casting method.

Independent Features Project/West eventually became Film Independent.

Dawn Hudson was director of Independent Features Project/West in 1995.

Barbara Boyle was Independent Features Project/West president from 1994 to 1999.

At the 2025 Independent Spirit Awards, acting president Brenda Robinson delivered a heartfelt tribute to longtime Film Independent president Josh Welsh, honoring the &quot;visionary&quot; who passed away on New Year&#x27;s Eve at the age of 62 after a five-year battle with colon cancer. Welsh, who had served as president since 2012, was remembered for his immense contributions to the organization and the film community.

<text>In linear algebra, a matrix unit is a matrix with only one nonzero entry with value 1. The matrix unit with a 1 in the &quot;i&quot;th row and &quot;j&quot;th column is denoted as formula_1. For example, the 3 by 3 matrix unit with &quot;i&quot; = 1 and &quot;j&quot; = 2 is
formula_2A vector unit is a standard unit vector.

A single-entry matrix generalizes the matrix unit for matrices with only one nonzero entry of any value, not necessarily of value 1.

== Properties ==

The set of &quot;m&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrix units is a basis of the space of &quot;m&quot; by &quot;n&quot; matrices.

The product of two matrix units of the same square shape formula_3 satisfies the relation
formula_4
where formula_5 is the Kronecker delta.

The group of scalar &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices over a ring &quot;R&quot; is the centralizer of the subset of &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix units in the set of &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices over &quot;R&quot;.

The matrix norm (induced by the same two vector norms) of a matrix unit is equal to 1.

When multiplied by another matrix, it isolates a specific row or column in arbitrary position. For example, for any 3-by-3 matrix &quot;A&quot;:

<doc id="1239241" wikidata="Q487888" url="?curid=1239241" title="Uzbekistani sum">
<text>The sum ( ; ISO code: UZS) is the official currency of Uzbekistan. Uzbekistan replaced the ruble with the sum at par in on 16 July 1994. No subdivisions of this sum were initially issued and only banknotes were produced, in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 sum. Further series, however, have introduced coins and a subunit, the tiyin. Because it was meant to be a transitional currency, the design was rather simplistic.

==Etymology==

The official name of the Soviet currency in Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Uzbek was &quot;som&quot;, and this name appeared written on the back of banknotes, among the texts for the value of the note in all 15 official languages of the USSR. The word &quot;sum&quot; (alternatively transliterated &quot;som&quot; or &quot;soum&quot;) means &quot;pure&quot; in Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uyghur and Uzbek, as well as in many other Turkic languages. The word implies &quot;pure&quot; silver or gold.

== First sum ==
===History===
Like other republics of the former Soviet Union, Uzbekistan continued using the Soviet/Russian ruble after independence. On 26 July 1993, a new series of Russian ruble was issued and the old Soviet/Russian ruble ceased to be legal tender in Russia. Some successor states had their national currencies before the change, some chose to continue using the pre-1993 Soviet/Russian ruble, and some chose to use both the pre-1993 and the new Russian ruble. &quot;Tables of modern monetary history: Asia&quot; implies that both old and new rubles were used in Uzbekistan.

Uzbekistan replaced the ruble with the sum at par in on 15 November 1993. No subdivisions of this sum were issued and only banknotes were produced, in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 sum. Because it was meant to be a transitional currency, the design was rather simplistic. All notes had the Coat of arms on the obverse, and Sher-Dor Madrasah of the Registan in Samarkand on the reverse.

===Coins===
No coins were issued for the first sum.

===Banknotes===
The first banknotes were issued by the State Bank of Uzbekistan in 1993. All of the denominations share the same designs: the Coat of arms of Uzbekistan on the front and the madrasahs on Registan Square in Samarkand.
== Second sum ==

===History===

On 1 July 1994, a second sum was introduced at a rate of 1 new sum = 1,000 old sum. This sum is subdivided into 100 &quot;tiyin&quot;.

==== Inflation ====
Until 2013, the largest denomination of Uzbek currency was the 1,000-sum banknote, then worth US$0.60, requiring Uzbeks to carry large bundles of notes for routine transactions.

Back in 2019, a new largest denomination was issued, the 100,000-sum banknote (as of October 2019 worth US$10.55), which made the situation easier. The smallest denomination, the 1 tiyin, is worth less than of a US cent making it the &quot;world&#x27;s most worthless coin&quot; that was still legal tender until 1 March 2020. However, coins and banknotes smaller than 50 sum are rare now.

The rampant inflation situation is considered a politically sensitive issue in Uzbekistan, which is why the Uzbek government is slow to acclimate the currency to its current value by issuing higher coin and note denominations. As a result, the current highest coin denomination in circulation is the 500 sum while the highest banknote denomination is the 200,000 sum. Official state figures put inflation as of the first half of 2011 at 3.6%, however accurate numbers are pinned far higher. Coins and banknotes below 50 sum are practically worthless now.

=== Coins ===
Three series of coins have been issued for the second sum. They can be easily distinguished by the script used for the Uzbek language. The first series was written in Cyrillic script, while the second and third series is written in Latin script.

====First series (1994–2000)====
====Second series (2000–2004)====
====Third series (2018–2022)====
In May 2018 the introduction of new coins valued 50, 100, 200 and 500 sum was announced. All previously issued banknotes and coins of those denominations were to be withdrawn from circulation by 1 July 2020. In 2022, the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan introduced a 1,000 sum coin into circulation, notable as it is the first bi-metallic coin issued for circulation since the introduction of the Uzbek sum in 1994.

=== Banknotes ===
The second and current series, issued by the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan, was released in 1994 in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 sum. A 200 sum banknote was issued in 1997, the 500 sum in 1999, the 1,000 sum in 2001, the 5,000 sum in 2013, the 10,000 sum on 10 March 2017, the 50,000 sum on 22 August 2017 and the 100,000 sum on 25 February 2019. The latter four denominations feature inscriptions in Latin-based Uzbek as opposed to Uzbek Cyrillic in banknotes of 1 to 1,000 Uzbek sum. On 14 June 2021, the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan issued the 2,000 and 20,000 sum banknotes to help bridge the gap between 1,000 and 5,000 sum as well as 10,000 and 50,000 sum. On 18 June 2021, the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan issued new 5,000 and 10,000 sum banknotes, utilizing the design templates of the 2,000 and 20,000 sum banknotes. In that same year, the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan issued new 50,000 and 100,000 sum banknotes as part of a new series of banknotes first introduced with the 2,000 and 20,000 sum banknotes. An entirely new 200,000 sum banknote was issued on 15 July 2022.


===Exchange rates===
At its introduction on 1 July 1994, 1 US dollar was equal to 25 sum.

==== 2017 reform ====
On 2 September 2017, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev issued a decree &quot;On priority measures of liberalizing foreign exchange policy&quot;. The reform took effect on 5 September 2017. The currency was untethered from its US dollar peg and started to float. As a result the sum&#x27;s exchange rate to the US dollar increased from 4,210 Uzbek sum to 8,100 Uzbek sum. The new rate was even weaker than the sum&#x27;s black-market convertibility of about 7,700 to the dollar. Restrictions on the amount of foreign currencies individuals and companies could buy were also abolished on the same day.

<text>Military advisors or combat advisors are military personnel deployed to advise on military matters. The term is often used for soldiers sent to foreign countries to aid such countries&#x27; militaries with their military education and training, organization, and other various military tasks. The foreign powers or organizations may send such soldiers to support countries or insurgencies while minimizing the risks of potential casualties and avoiding the political ramifications of overtly mobilizing military forces to aid an ally.

==European advisors during the American Revolution==
The French Marquis de Lafayette and the Prussian Baron von Steuben offered key assistance to the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War of 1775–1783.

== Soviet military advisors ==

The Soviet Union deployed military advisors in (for example) Spain, China and Angola, where &quot;The 1976 treaty of friendship and cooperation provided for Soviet-Angolan military cooperation in strengthening the mutual defense capacity. Moscow immediately provided weaponry and supplies, and some 500 military advisors.&quot;

In China, the &quot;Soviet Union ..sent about 1500 military advisors ..during this period [1937-39]. Included were some of the red Army&#x27;s best officers [...] Georgii Zhukov [...] Vasilii I. Chuikov [...] P.F. Batitsky [...] Andrey A. Vlasov [...]. Like Spain, China served as a training ground for Soviet officers.&quot;

== German military advisors ==

=== Nationalist Spain ===
During the Spanish Civil War, Germany deployed a large number of &#x27;volunteers&#x27;, also known as the Condor Legion, to serve as mercenaries and pilots to assist the nationalist forces. Approximately 300 out of a total of 16,000 German citizens fighting in the war were killed.

=== Republic of China ===
During the Interwar Period, German Military advisors under Alexander von Falkenhausen were involved in modernising the National Revolutionary Army.

=== Ottoman Empire ===
the German Empire sent advisors to the Ottoman Empire, notably generals such as Otto Liman Von Sanders and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz 

== United Kingdom military advisors ==

T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) became arguably the archetypal British military advisor due to his guerrilla role (1916–1918) in the Arab Revolt.

==United States military advisors==
 Developing capabilities and increasing capacity through advising is an operation the U.S. Army has conducted for more than one hundred years. The Army has performed advisory missions to increase the capability and capacity of foreign militaries from the Philippine Insurrection at the beginning of the 20th century to more recent conflicts in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.
===U.S. advisors in Vietnam===

In the early 1960s elements of the U.S. Army Special Forces and Echo 31 went to South Vietnam as military advisors to train and assist the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) for impending actions against the North Vietnamese People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN). United States Marines also filled a significant role as advisors to Vietnamese forces.

===U.S. advisors during the War on Terror===
Combat advisors served during the U.S. war on terror. They were designated as Embedded Training Teams (ETTs) in Afghanistan and as Military Transition Teams (MTTs) in Iraq. These soldiers and Marines live with their Afghan and Iraqi counterparts (often in very austere and stoic conditions) in remote combat outposts often a great distance away from any U.S. or coalition support.

ETTs and MTTs are composed primarily of United States Army, National Guard, and Marine Corps personnel with a combat-arms background. United States Army Reserve, United States Air Force and United States Navy personnel serve as advisors in logistics and other support roles. The advisors on the ground in infantry or commando units of the ANA (Afghan National Army) or the Iraqi Army are soldiers or Marines with combat-arms experience. Special Forces and Navy SEALS also work with ANA/ASF or with the Iraqi Army, but the bulk of combat advisors are infantry and combat-arms soldiers and Marines.
The Combat Advisor Mission Defined. The combat advisor mission requires US officers and NCOs to teach, coach and mentor host nation (HN) security force counterparts. This enables the rapid development of our counterparts&#x27; leadership capabilities; helps develop command and control (C2) and operational capabilities at every echelon; allows direct access to Coalition Forces (CF) enablers to enhance HN security force counterinsurgency (COIN) operations; and incorporates CF lethal and nonlethal effects on the battlefield.
Security Forces Assistance (SFA) defines a more in-depth method of embedded mentorship. MTTs have fallen into disuse with shifts in focus and doctrine. Specifically, previous MTTs were drawn from soldiers from separate units, often on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis. SFATs, on the other hand, provide all personnel from organic, modular Brigade Combat Teams rather than supplying personnel piece-meal from various Army units. By design, these teams are composed of a company command team and selected leaders from one command. This SFAT concept has been in place since 2012, with a &quot;by, with and through&quot; method of combat advising. Current Advisory Teams are trained at Fort Polk, Louisiana at the Advisor Academy, &quot;Tigerland&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Allington Castle&quot; was one of 44 built for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. She was named after Allington Castle in Kent. Completed in 1944, she served as a convoy escort during the war and on fishery patrol duties in 1945–1947, being sold for scrap in 1958.

==Design and description==
The Castle-class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding Flower class, enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The &quot;Castle&quot;s carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 99 officers and ratings.

The Castle-class ships were equipped with a single QF Mk XVI gun forward, but their primary weapon was their single three-barrel Squid anti-submarine mortar. This was backed up by one depth charge rail and two throwers for 15 depth charges. The ships were fitted with two twin and a pair of single mounts for Oerlikon light AA guns. Provision was made for a further four single mounts if needed. They were equipped with Type 145Q and Type 147B ASDIC sets to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water. A Type 277 search radar and a HF/DF radio direction finder rounded out the Castles&#x27; sensor suite.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Allington Castle&quot; was laid down by Fleming and Ferguson at their shipyard at Paisley, Scotland, on 22 July 1943 and launched on 29 February 1944. She was completed on 19 June and served as a convoy escort until the end of the Second World War in May 1945. The ship was placed in reserve on 25 May. &quot;Allington Castle&quot; was reactivated in November and assigned to the Fishery Protection Flotilla based at Fleetwood. In 1947 she returned to reserve. The ship was sold and arrived at Sunderland on 20 December 1958 to be broken up.

<doc id="1239253" wikidata="Q735688" url="?curid=1239253" title="Alparslan Türkeş">
<text>Alparslan Türkeş (; 25 November 1917 – 4 April 1997) was a Turkish politician, who was the founder and president of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and the Grey Wolves &quot;(Ülkü Ocakları)&quot;. He ran the Grey Wolves training camps from 1968 to 1978. More than 600 people are said to have fallen victim of political murders by the Grey Wolves between 1968 and 1980. He represented the far-right of the Turkish political spectrum. He was and still is called &quot;Başbuğ&quot; (&quot;Leader&quot;) by his devotees.

== Early life ==
Türkeş was born in Nicosia, British Cyprus, to a Turkish Cypriot family in 1917. His birth name is disputed, some claiming that it is Hüseyin Feyzullah, while MHP claims it is Ali Arslan. His paternal great-grandfather had emigrated to Cyprus from Kayseri, Central Anatolia, Ottoman Empire, in the 1860s. His father, Ahmet Hamdi Bey, was from Tuzla, near Famagusta, and his mother, Fatma Zehra Hanım, was from Larnaca. However, in an interview with the scholar Fatma Müge Göçek the journalist Hrant Dink claimed that Türkeş was of Armenian descent, an orphan originally from Sivas who was later adopted by a Muslim couple from Cyprus. In 1932, with fifteen years of age, Türkeş emigrated to Istanbul, Turkey with his family. He was enrolled into the military lycée in Istanbul in 1933 and completed his secondary education in 1936. In 1938, he joined the army and his military career began.

==Racism-Turanism trials==
Along with other nationalists like Nihal Atsız and Nejdet Sançar, Türkeş was court-martialed on charges of &quot;fascist and racist activities&quot; in 1945. He spent 10 months in prison before he was released the same year. The charges were eventually dismissed in 1947. The trial would become known as the Racism-Turanism trials.

==Political career==
He attained fame as the spokesman of the 27 May 1960 coup d&#x27;état against the government of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, who was later executed after the Yassiada trial. He assumed a position as an undersecretary of the Prime Minister. However Türkeş, together with , declared their opposition to returning the power back to civilians and therefor were expelled by an internal coup within the junta (National Unity Committee). Türkeş was sent into exile to the Turkish embassy in New Delhi. He returned in February 1963 and together with others of the fourteen, he later joined the Republican Villager Nation Party (, CKMP). Türkeş was elected as its chairman on 1 August 1965. In 1969 the CKMP was renamed the Nationalist Movement Party (, MHP). As leader of the MHP he was also the de facto leader of the Grey Wolves. This far-right movement executed political murders, which began in 1968. More than 600 people are said to have fallen victim between 1968 and 1980.

Türkeş served as Deputy Prime Minister in right-wing National Front () cabinets in the 1970s. After the Military coup of 1980, he was imprisoned for more than four years and the Government demanded the death sentence for him as well as other Turkish nationalists. But in a turn of events he was released on 9 April 1985. He rejoined the political arena within the (MÇP) in 1987 and was elected to parliament representing the province of Yozgat on a ticket of the Welfare Party (RP) in 1991. In 1992 the name Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) was relaunched in exchange of the name of the MÇP and the party logo of the three crescents was presented to the public.

== Ideology ==

Through the far-right MHP, Türkeş took the rightist views of his predecessors like Nihal Atsız, and transformed them into a powerful political force. In 1965, Türkeş released a political pamphlet titled Nine Lights Doctrine (), which formed the basis of the nationalist ideology of the CKMP. This text listed nine basic principles which were: nationalism; idealism; moralism; scientism; societalism; ruralism; libertism and personalism; progressivism and populism; industrialism and technologism.

Hans-Lukas Kieser notes that although Türkeş openly identified with pan-Turkism and sympathised with National Socialism as well as Adolf Hitler, he was still allowed to rise through the ranks of the Turkish Army and was even allowed to move to the United States in order to pursue military education and cooperation within NATO. Türkeş led the vanguard of anti-communism in Turkey; he was a founding member of the Counter-Guerrilla, the Turkish Gladio.

He has been the spiritual leader of the Idealism Schools Foundation of Culture and Art (). His followers consider him to be one of the leading icons of the Turkish nationalist movement.

==International politics==

The wellbeing of the greater Turkish nation living in a so-called Turan, which according to him included Turks wherever they lived, be it in Greece, Cyprus or elsewhere, was key concern of his political views. On 28 April 1978 he was received by Franz Josef Strauss, former minister for defense and finance in Germany and acting president of the CSU party. In 1992, Alparslan Türkeş visited Baku to support Abulfaz Elchibey during the Azerbaijan presidential election. He also had a meeting with Levon Ter-Petrosyan, the President of Armenia in the 1990s.

==Personal life==
Türkeş was married twice and had seven children. He married Muzaffer Hanım in 1940 and had four daughters (Ayzit, Umay, Selcen and Çağrı) and one son (Tuğrul) with her. Their marriage lasted until his wife&#x27;s death in 1974. By 1976 Türkeş married Seval Hanım and had one daughter (Ayyüce) and one son (Ahmet Kutalmış).

Türkeş died of a heart attack at the age of 80 on 4 April 1997. The announcement of his death was delayed for five hours while nationwide security measures were implemented; thereafter, thousands of his supporters went to the Bayindir Hospital chanting &quot;Leaders never die&quot;. His funeral was held in Kocatepe Mosque in Ankara.

Türkeş&#x27;s youngest son, Ahmet Kutalmış Türkeş, is a member of the Justice and Development Party and was elected as an Istanbul deputy in 2011. However, he resigned several days before the June 2015 elections, protesting the party&#x27;s plans to transform the parliamentary system into a presidential one.

In 2015, Türkeş&#x27;s eldest son, Tuğrul Türkeş, became the first person of Turkish Cypriot origin to be Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey. In September 2015, Türkeş made his first official visit to Northern Cyprus. As an independent parliamentarian, Türkeş has criticized the Nationalist Movement Party (founded by his father) and the Republican People&#x27;s Party for their unwillingness to compromise, which led to the November 2015 elections.

== Legacy ==
Türkeş was a key figure in shaping Turkish nationalism and reviving Pan-Turkism from the 1940s onwards. Soon after his death in 1997, Turkish President Süleyman Demirel stated that his passing had been a &quot;great loss to the political life of Turkey&quot;. Similarly, Turkey&#x27;s first female Prime Minister Tansu Çiller described him as a &quot;historic individual&quot;.

==Controversies==
When he died, it was revealed that he had embezzled 2 trillion lira from the European Turkish Federation. The pan-Turkist group had created a secret slush fund to support the Second Chechen War and help Abulfaz Elchibey succeed in Azerbaijan. The money was formerly administered by Enver Altaylı, who had been part of the Azerbaijan coup plot. His daughters, Ayzıt and Umay Günay, quarreled over who was the rightful owner despite the fact that it was neither of them. The two appeared before the Ankara 7th High Penal Court for fraud. The indictment said that Türkeş&#x27; account in a U.K. branch of the Deutsche Bank held 575,000 DM, US$845,000, and 367,000 GBP. The court concluded that Ayzıt had withdrawn 200,000 GBP while Umay Günay had withdrawn 42,000 GBP. Ayzıt said that she had been living in the UK since 1975, and that her father opened the account in 1988, giving her complete access to it. She said that her father had instructed her to fulfill his financial obligations in support of &quot;the cause of Turkishness&quot; upon his death by making certain payments. Türkeş&#x27; second wife, Seval, refuted Ayzıt&#x27;s claim that she had not kept the money to herself. Seval claims that she and her sons&#x27; Ayyüce and Ahmet Kutalmış share of the withdrawn 242,000 GBP is 112,355 GBP.

The MHP&#x27;s chairman, Devlet Bahçeli, instructed his deputies to keep mum, fearing that the scandal could lead to the dissolution of the party.

The case was closed due to the statute of limitations.

<doc id="1239256" wikidata="Q6166864" url="?curid=1239256" title="Jay London">
<text>Jay London (born September 12, 1966) is an American stand-up comic, whose one-liner jokes made him a favorite on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;. Although he did not win either of the two seasons in which he appeared (Seasons 2 and 3, both in 2004), his humble personality and clean comedy made him a favorite among the show&#x27;s fans.

London was born in The Bronx, but grew up in Flushing, Queens, before moving to Los Angeles in his adult years. He was a boxer and a taxicab driver, among other occupations, before becoming a stand-up comic in the 1980s.

==Comedy style==

London is known for his long curly hair and bib overalls. His signature line is &quot;You might recognize me, I&#x27;m the fourth guy from the left on the evolutionary chart,&quot; referring to his slouching posture and unkempt appearance. His comedy is usually self-deprecating and laden with quips such as &quot;0 for 1&quot;, &quot;This is death!&quot; and his trademark line, &quot;It&#x27;s almost over.&quot; During his run on &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;, he made a guest appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

After &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;, London joined fellow Season 2 competitors Gary Gulman and Alonzo Bodden as part of the &quot;I&#x27;m Still Standing&quot; comedy tour. He has also done shows for cancer patients and small comedy clubs. In 2004, Jay made an appearance on the game show &quot;Street Smarts&quot;; in 2005, he appeared on the CBS sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, on the TBS reality show &quot;Minding the Store&quot; and Bravo&#x27;s &quot;All-Star Reality Reunion&quot;.

On August 1, 2006, Mr. London made a return appearance on Last Comic Standing. The pilot to his television show, &quot;The Jay London Show&quot;, debuted on his official website in January 2007 (costarring his real-life sister Melanie).

London served as the opening act on Louis C.K.&#x27;s 2015 stand up special, Live At The Comedy Store.

<doc id="1239257" wikidata="Q491842" url="?curid=1239257" title="Diyarbekir vilayet">
<text>The Vilayet of Diyâr-ı Bekr (, , ) was a first-level administrative division (vilayet) of the Ottoman Empire, wholly located within what is now modern Turkey. The vilayet extended south from Palu on the Euphrates to Mardin and Nusaybin on the edge of the Mesopotamian plain. After the establishment of Republic of Turkey in 1923, the region was incorporated into the newly created state.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Diyarbekir Vilayet reportedly had an area of , while the preliminary results of the first Ottoman census of 1885 (published in 1908) gave the population as 471,462. The accuracy of the population figures ranges from &quot;approximate&quot; to &quot;merely conjectural&quot; depending on the region from which they were gathered.

==History==
The Vilayet of Diyarbakir was created in 1867. In 1867 or 1868 Mamuret-ul-Aziz and the Kurdistan Eyalet merged with and joined the Vilayet of Diyarbakir. In 1879–80 Mamuret-ul-Aziz was separated again from the Vilayet of Diyarbakir, and turned into the Vilayet of Mamuret-ul-Aziz. It was one of the six Armenian Vilayets of the Empire.

==Administrative divisions==

Sanjaks of the vilayet:
# Diyarbekir Sanjak (Diyarbakır, Lice, Silvan, Derik, Beşiri)
# Mardin Sanjak (Mardin, Cizre, Midyat, Savur, Nusaybin and maybe Silopi)
# Ergani Sanjak (Maden, Palu)
# Siverek Sanjak (Split from Diyarbekir in 1907) (Siverek, Çermik, Viranşehir)

== Demographics ==
The Vilayet was a place in which the Christian population was systematically massacred during World War I during the 1915 genocide in Diyarbekir.

<text>Steerage is a term for the lowest category of passenger accommodation in a ship. In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, considerable numbers of persons travelled from their homeland to seek a new life elsewhere, in many cases North America and Australia. Many of those people were destitute in their homeland and had the minimum of resources to procure transportation. The term later widened to imply the lowest category of accommodation on a passenger vessel.

==Steerage class travel==

Steerage refers to the lowest possible category of long-distance steamer travel. It was available to very poor people, usually emigrants seeking a new life in the New World, chiefly North America and Australia. In many cases, these people had no financial resources and were attempting to escape destitution at home. Consequently, they needed transportation at an absolute minimum cost. In many cases they provided their own bedding and food. Steerage was very cramped and there was hardly any room for fresh air to get there. The poor conditions and the very long voyages could contribute to en route deaths of passengers in steerage. The word likely comes from the fact that these accommodations were originally located near the ship&#x27;s rudder. 

The term steerage was used to refer to the lowest category of accommodation, usually not including proper sleeping accommodation. In the United Kingdom, it was often referred to as &quot;third class&quot;, but there were instances where steerage was effectively fourth-class. In time, the designation came to refer to the lowest category in general, and in modern times is sometimes used sarcastically to refer to any uncomfortable accommodation in an airliner, ship or train.

Beds were often long rows of large shared bunks with straw mattresses and no bed linens.

A commentator described conditions in steerage aboard the in 1906:

<text>An electric arc (or arc discharge) is an electrical breakdown of a gas that produces a prolonged electrical discharge. The current through a normally nonconductive medium such as air produces a plasma, which may produce visible light. An arc discharge is initiated either by thermionic emission or by field emission. After initiation, the arc relies on thermionic emission of electrons from the electrodes supporting the arc.
An arc discharge is characterized by a lower voltage than a glow discharge. An archaic term is voltaic arc, as used in the phrase &quot;voltaic arc lamp&quot;.

Techniques for arc suppression can be used to reduce the duration or likelihood of arc formation.

In the late 19th century, electric arc lighting was in wide use for public lighting.
Some low-pressure electric arcs are used in many applications. For example, fluorescent tubes, mercury, sodium, and metal-halide lamps are used for lighting; xenon arc lamps have been used for movie projectors. Electric arcs can be utilized for manufacturing processes, such as electric arc welding, plasma cutting and electric arc furnaces for steel recycling.

==History==

Sir Humphry Davy discovered the short-pulse electrical arc in 1800. In 1801, he described the phenomenon in a paper published in William Nicholson&#x27;s &quot;Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts&quot;. According to modern science, Davy&#x27;s description was a spark rather than an arc. In the same year Davy publicly demonstrated the effect, before the Royal Society, by transmitting an electric current through two carbon rods that touched, and then pulling them a short distance apart. The demonstration produced a &quot;feeble&quot; arc, not readily distinguished from a sustained spark, between charcoal points. The Society subscribed for a more powerful battery of 1,000 plates, and in 1808 he demonstrated the large-scale arc. He is credited with naming the arc. He called it an arc because it assumes the shape of an upward bow when the distance between the electrodes is not small. This is due to the buoyant force on the hot gas.

The first continuous arc was discovered independently in 1802 and described in 1803 as a &quot;special fluid with electrical properties&quot;, by Vasily V. Petrov, a Russian scientist experimenting with a copper-zinc battery consisting of 4200 discs.

In the late nineteenth century, electric arc lighting was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem. In 1895, Hertha Marks Ayrton wrote a series of articles for the &quot;Electrician&quot;, explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE). Her paper was entitled &quot;The Hissing of the Electric Arc&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Ayrton was elected the first female member of the IEE; the next woman to be admitted to the IEE was in 1958. She petitioned to present a paper before the Royal Society, but she was not allowed because of her gender, and &quot;The Mechanism of the Electric Arc&quot; was read by John Perry in her stead in 1901.

==Overview==
An electric arc is the form of electric discharge with the highest current density. The maximum current through an arc is limited only by the external circuit, not by the arc itself.

An arc between two electrodes can be initiated by ionization and glow discharge, when the current through the electrodes is increased. The breakdown voltage of the electrode gap is a combined function of the pressure, distance between electrodes and type of gas surrounding the electrodes. When an arc starts, its terminal voltage is much less than a glow discharge, and current is higher. An arc in gases near atmospheric pressure is characterized by visible light emission, high current density, and high temperature. An arc is distinguished from a glow discharge partly by the similar temperatures of the electrons and the positive ions; in a glow discharge, the ions are much colder than the electrons.

A drawn arc can be initiated by two electrodes initially in contact and drawn apart; this can initiate an arc without the high-voltage glow discharge. This is the way a welder starts to weld a joint, momentarily touching the welding electrode against the workpiece then withdrawing it until a stable arc is formed. Another example is separation of electrical contacts in switches, relays or circuit breakers; in high-energy circuits arc suppression may be required to prevent damage to contacts.

Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which ionizes more gas molecules (where the degree of ionization is determined by temperature), and as per this sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma; the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium; the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the atoms, molecules, ions, and electrons. The energy given to electrons is dispersed rapidly to the heavier particles by elastic collisions, due to their great mobility and large numbers.

Current in the arc is sustained by thermionic emission and field emission of electrons at the cathode. The current may be concentrated in a very small hot spot on the cathode; current densities on the order of one million amperes per square centimeter can be found. Unlike a glow discharge, an arc has little discernible structure, since the positive column is quite bright and extends nearly to the electrodes on both ends. The cathode fall and anode fall of a few volts occur within a fraction of a millimeter of each electrode. The positive column has a lower voltage gradient and may be absent in very short arcs.

A low-frequency (less than 100 Hz) alternating current arc resembles a direct current arc; on each cycle, the arc is initiated by breakdown, and the electrodes interchange roles, as anode or cathode, when current reverses. As the frequency of the current increases, there is not enough time for all ionization to disperse on each half cycle, and the breakdown is no longer needed to sustain the arc; the voltage vs. current characteristic becomes more nearly ohmic.
The various shapes of electric arcs are emergent properties of non-linear patterns of current and electric field. The arc occurs in the gas-filled space between two conductive electrodes (often made of tungsten or carbon) and it results in a very high temperature, capable of melting or vaporizing most materials. An electric arc is a continuous discharge, while the similar electric spark discharge is momentary. An electric arc may occur either in direct current (DC) circuits or in alternating current (AC) circuits. In the latter case, the arc may re-strike on each half cycle of the current. An electric arc differs from a glow discharge in that the current density is quite high, and the voltage drop within the arc is low; at the cathode, the current density can be as high as one megaampere per square centimeter.

An electric arc has a non-linear relationship between current and voltage. Once the arc is established (either by progression from a glow discharge or by momentarily touching the electrodes then separating them), increased current results in a lower voltage between the arc terminals. This negative resistance effect requires that some positive form of impedance (as an electrical ballast) be placed in the circuit to maintain a stable arc. This property is the reason uncontrolled electrical arcs in apparatus become so destructive, since once initiated an arc will draw more and more current from a fixed-voltage supply until the apparatus is destroyed.

==Uses==

Industrially, electric arcs are used for welding, plasma cutting, for electrical discharge machining, as an arc lamp in movie projectors, and spotlights in stage lighting. Electric arc furnaces are used to produce steel and other substances. Calcium carbide is made in this way as it requires a large amount of energy to promote an endothermic reaction (at temperatures of 2500 °C).

Carbon arc lights were the first electric lights. They were used for street lights in the 19th century and for specialized applications such as searchlights until World War II. Today, electric arcs are used in many applications. For example, fluorescent tubes, mercury, sodium, and metal halide lamps are used for lighting; xenon arc lamps are used for movie projectors and theatrical spotlights.

Formation of an intense electric arc, similar to a small-scale arc flash, is the foundation of exploding-bridgewire detonators.

Electric arcs are used in arcjet, a form of electric propulsion of spacecraft.

They are used in the laboratory for spectroscopy to create spectral emissions by intense heating of a sample of matter.

=== Protection of electrical equipment ===
Arc is still being used in high voltage switchgear for protection of extra high voltage transmission networks. To protect a unit (e. g., a series capacitor in a transmission line) against overvoltage, an arc-inducing device, so called spark gap, is connected in parallel to the unit. Once the voltage reaches the air-breakdown threshold, an arc ignites across the spark plug and short-circuits the terminals of the unit, thus protecting the latter from the overvoltage. For the &quot;reinsertion&quot; of a unit, the arc needs to be extinguished, this can be achieved in multiple ways. For example, a spark gap can be fitted with arcing horns − two wires, approximately vertical but gradually diverging from each other towards the top in a narrow &quot;V&quot; shape. Once ignited, the arc will move upwards along the wires and will break down when the distance between the wires will become too large. If the arc is extinguished and the original trigger condition no longer exists (a fault has been resolved or a bypass switch engaged), the arc will not reignite. The arc can be also broken by a blast of compressed air or another gas.

An undesirable arc can also occur when a high-voltage switch is opened and is extinguished in similar ways. Modern devices use sulphur hexafluoride at high pressure in a nozzle flow between separated electrodes within a pressurized vessel. The arc current is interrupted at the moment within an AC cycle when the current goes to zero and the highly electronegative SF6 ions quickly absorb free electrons from the decaying plasma. The SF6 technology mostly displaced the similar air-based one because many noisy air-blast units in series were required to prevent the arc inside the switch from re-igniting.

===Visual entertainment===


A Jacob&#x27;s ladder (more formally, a high voltage travelling arc) is a device for producing a continuous train of electric arcs that rise upwards. The device is named for the Jacob&#x27;s Ladder leading to heaven as described in the Bible. Similarly to the arcing horns, the spark gap is formed by two wires diverging from the base to the top.

When high voltage is applied to the gap, a spark forms across the bottom of the wires where they are nearest each other, rapidly changing to an electric arc. Air breaks down at about 30 kV/cm, depending on humidity, temperature, etc. Apart from the anode and cathode voltage drops, the arc behaves almost as a short circuit, drawing as much current as the electrical power supply can deliver, and the heavy load dramatically reduces the voltage across the gap.

The heated ionized air rises, carrying the current path with it. As the trail of ionization gets longer, it becomes more and more unstable, finally breaking. The voltage across the electrodes then rises and the spark re-forms at the bottom of the device.

This cycle leads to an exotic-looking display of electric white, yellow, blue or purple arcs, which is often seen in horror films and films about mad scientists. The device was a staple in schools and science fairs of the 1950s and 1960s, typically constructed out of a Model T spark coil or any other source of high voltage in the 10,000–30,000-volt range, such as a neon sign transformer (5–15 kV) or a television picture tube circuit (flyback transformer) (10–28 kV), and two coat hangers or rods built into a &quot;V&quot; shape. For larger ladders, microwave oven transformers connected in series, voltage multipliers and utility pole transformers (pole pigs) run in reverse (step-up) are commonly used.

===Guiding the arc===
Scientists have discovered a method to control the path of an arc between two electrodes by firing laser beams at the gas between the electrodes. The gas becomes a plasma and guides the arc. By constructing the plasma path between the electrodes with different laser beams, the arc can be formed into curved and S-shaped paths. The arc could also hit an obstacle and reform on the other side of the obstacle. The laser-guided arc technology could be useful in applications to deliver a spark of electricity to a precise spot.

==Undesired arcing==
Undesired or unintended electric arcing can have detrimental effects on electric power transmission, distribution systems and electronic equipment. Devices which may cause arcing include switches, circuit breakers, relay contacts, fuses and poor cable terminations. When an inductive circuit is switched off, the current cannot instantaneously jump to zero: a transient arc will be formed across the separating contacts. Switching devices susceptible to arcing are normally designed to contain and extinguish an arc, and snubber circuits can supply a path for transient currents, preventing arcing. If a circuit has enough current and voltage to sustain an arc formed outside of a switching device, the arc can cause damage to equipment such as melting of conductors, destruction of insulation, and fire. An arc flash describes an explosive electrical event that presents a hazard to people and equipment.

Undesired arcing in electrical contacts of contactors, relays and switches can be reduced by devices such as contact arc suppressors and RC snubbers or through techniques including:
* immersion in transformer oil, dielectric gas or vacuum
* arc chutes
* magnetic blowouts
* pneumatic blowouts
* sacrificial (&quot;arcing&quot;) contacts
* damping materials to absorb arc energy, either thermally or through chemical decomposition

Arcing can also occur when a low resistance channel (foreign object, conductive dust, moisture...) forms between places with different voltage. The conductive channel then can facilitate formation of an electric arc. The ionized air has high electrical conductivity approaching that of metals, and it can conduct extremely high currents, causing a short circuit and tripping protective devices (fuses and circuit breakers). A similar situation may occur when a lightbulb burns out and the fragments of the filament pull an electric arc between the leads inside the bulb, leading to overcurrent that trips the breakers.

An electric arc over the surface of plastics causes their degradation. A conductive carbon-rich track tends to form in the arc path, called &quot;carbon tracking&quot;, negatively influencing their insulation properties. The arc susceptibility, or &quot;track resistance&quot;, is tested according to ASTM D495, by point electrodes and continuous and intermittent arcs; it is measured in seconds required to form a track that is conductive under high-voltage low-current conditions. Some materials are less susceptible to degradation than others. For example, polytetrafluoroethylene has arc resistance of about 200 seconds (3.3 minutes). From thermosetting plastics, alkyds and melamine resins are better than phenolic resins. Polyethylenes have arc resistance of about 150 seconds; polystyrenes and polyvinyl chlorides have relatively low resistance of about 70 seconds. Plastics can be formulated to emit gases with arc-extinguishing properties; these are known as &quot;arc-extinguishing plastics&quot;.

Arcing over some types of printed circuit boards, possibly due to cracks of the traces or the failure of a solder joint, renders the affected insulating layer conductive as the dielectric is combusted due to the high temperatures involved. This conductivity prolongs the arcing due to cascading failure of the surface.

==Arc suppression==
Arc suppression is a method of attempting to reduce or eliminate an electrical arc. There are several possible areas of use of arc suppression methods, among them metal film deposition and sputtering, arc flash protection, electrostatic processes where electrical arcs are not desired (such as powder painting, air purification, PVDF film poling) and contact current arc suppression. In industrial, military and consumer electronic design, the latter method generally applies to devices such as electromechanical power switches, relays and contactors. In this context, arc suppression uses contact protection.

Part of the energy of an electrical arc forms new chemical compounds from the air surrounding the arc: these include oxides of nitrogen and ozone, the second of which can be detected by its distinctive sharp smell. These chemicals can be produced by high-power contacts in relays and motor commutators, and they are corrosive to nearby metal surfaces. Arcing also erodes the surfaces of the contacts, wearing them down and creating high contact resistance when closed.

==Health hazards==
Exposure to an arc-producing device can pose health hazards. An arc formed in air will ionize oxygen and nitrogen, which then can re-form into reactive molecules such as ozone and nitric oxide. These products can be damaging to the mucous membranes. Plants are also susceptible to ozone poisoning. These hazards are greatest when the arc is continuous and in an enclosed space such as a room. An arc that occurs outside is less of a hazard because the heated ionized gases will rise up into the air and dissipate into the atmosphere. Spark gaps which only intermittently produce short spark bursts are also minimally hazardous because the volume of ions generated is very small.

Arcs can also produce a broad spectrum of wavelengths spanning the visible light and the invisible ultraviolet and infrared spectrum. Very intense arcs generated by means such as arc welding can produce significant amounts of ultraviolet radiation which is damaging to the cornea of the observer. These arcs should only be observed through special dark filters which reduce the arc intensity and shield the observer&#x27;s eyes from the ultraviolet rays.

<text>House of Bush, House of Saud: The Secret Relationship Between the World&#x27;s Two Most Powerful Dynasties is a 2004 book by Craig Unger that explores the relationship between the Saudi Royal Family and the Bush extended political family. Unger asserts that the groundwork for today&#x27;s terrorist movements and the modern wars that have sprung up about them was unintentionally laid more than 30 years ago with a series of business deals between the ruling Saudis and the powerful Bush family. The Saudis received investments and military protection in exchange for cooperation on lucrative oil deals. The author claims that the result has been a shady alliance between &quot;the world&#x27;s two most powerful dynasties.&quot; Unger writes, &quot;Never before has an American president been so closely tied to a foreign power that harbors and supports our country&#x27;s mortal enemies.&quot;

Unger reportedly traced $1.4 billion in investments by the Saudis to friends and business organizations closely associated with the Bush family. &quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s Michael Isikoff had harsh criticism of the $1.4 billion figure, the Saudi connection, and the flights out of the U.S. According to Isikoff: &quot;Nearly 90 percent of that amount, $1.18 billion, comes from just one source: contracts in the early to mid-1990s that the Saudi Arabian government awarded to a U.S. defense contractor, BDM, for training the country&#x27;s military and National Guard.&quot; According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, George W. Bush could not have been involved with the Carlyle Group, which owned BDM, when the $1.18 billion deal was made, because &quot;former president Bush didn&#x27;t join the Carlyle advisory board until April, 1998—five months after Carlyle had already sold BDM to another defense firm.&quot;

On his website, Unger replied that Isikoff wrongly suggests that the Bush family and its allies had little or no relationship with the Carlyle Group until 1998. &quot;If that were true, he might have a point.&quot;But in fact, the Bush-Carlyle relationship began eight years earlier when the Carlyle Group put George W. Bush on the board of one of its subsidiaries, Caterair, in 1990. In 1993, after the Bush-Quayle administration left office and George H. W. Bush and James Baker were free to join the private sector, the Bush family&#x27;s relationship with the Carlyle Group began to become substantive. By the end of that year, key figures at the Carlyle Group included such powerful Bush colleagues as James Baker, Frank Carlucci, and Richard Darman. Because George W. Bush&#x27;s role at Carlyle had been marginal, the $1.4 billion figure includes no contracts that predated the arrival of Baker, Carlucci and Darman at Carlyle. With former Secretary of Defense Carlucci guiding the acquisition of defense companies, Carlyle finally began making real money from the Saudis, both through investments from the royal family, the bin Ladens and other members of the Saudi elite, and through lucrative defense investments.Isikoff also argued there was nothing extraordinary about the evacuation of the Saudis because Tampa International Airport had reopened. Unger disagreed, noting, &quot;Commercial aviation slowly resumed on September 13, but at 10:57 am that day, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a Notice to Airmen stating that private aviation was still banned. Three planes violated that order and were forced down by American military aircraft that day. Yet the Saudis were allowed to fly on the ten passenger Learjet. ... The Tampa to Lexington flight is vital because it required permission from the highest levels of our government. If it were just another normal flight, why would anyone go to a crisis-stricken White House to get permission for the Saudis to fly?&quot;

Research conducted for this book backs up claims made in controversial documentary filmmaker Michael Moore&#x27;s 2004 picture &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.

<doc id="1239273" wikidata="Q6249310" url="?curid=1239273" title="John Moores (baseball)">
<text>John Jay Moores (born July 9, 1944, in San Antonio, Texas, as John Jay Broderick) is an American entrepreneur and philanthropist, and the former owner of the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball (MLB).

==Early life==
Moores was born in San Antonio, Texas—the eldest son of Jack and Katherine Broderick. Jack Broderick abandoned his wife, son John, and two younger sons in 1948. In 1950, Katherine wed again, to Cyrus &quot;Red&quot; Moores, a photographer with the &quot;Corpus Christi Caller&quot; newspaper, and her sons were given their stepfather&#x27;s name. Red Moores, by then in insurance, moved the family to Houston, Texas, in 1960, and John spent his high school years there. He left Texas A&amp;M University before graduating and became a programmer for IBM. He later studied at the University of Houston where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Juris Doctor from the University of Houston Law Center.

==Career==
===Business===
He founded BMC Software in Texas in 1980, and was the lead venture capital financier for Peregrine Systems in California starting in 1981, as well as ServiceNow, another California corporation founded in 2005. He served as a director of Peregrine from March 1989 to March 2003 and as chairman of the board from March 1990 through July 2000 and from May 2002 through March 2003, during which he cashed out between US$600 and US$630 million in Peregrine stock. He resigned as Peregrine chairman in February 2003 as part of the company&#x27;s Chapter 11 reorganization. He also founded JMI Equity. In 1994, Moores purchased the San Diego Padres professional baseball team from Tom Werner. In 2009, he began the process of incrementally selling the Padres to a group of twelve investors, headed by Jeff Moorad (former sports agent and CEO of the Arizona Diamondbacks) for about $500 million. The deal fell through in 2012, and Moores instead sold the team for $800 million to a group led by Ron Fowler. Moores was voted into the Padres Hall of Fame in 2023.

He continues to operate in the IT service management market with continued investments through his venture capital firm JMI Equity.

===Philanthropy and activism===
Organizations that Moores has supported include the ACLU, the San Diego Zoo, San Diego State University, the San Diego Symphony, San Diego Center for Children, the Boys and Girls Clubs, St. Vincent de Paul Villages, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and Scripps Research, where Moores sits on the board.

His 1991 contribution of US$51 million to the University of Houston was the largest in U.S. history to a public university. He served on the University of Houston System Board of Regents from 1991 to 1994. Among many other philanthropic efforts, John and Becky Moores donated US$21 million to establish the John and Rebecca Moores Cancer Center at the University of California, San Diego, and over US$20 million to San Diego State University. In 1999, he was appointed Regent of the University of California by Governor Gray Davis until he resigned for unknown reasons in 2007. As UC regent, he worked to make sure Proposition 209 (passed in 1996) was implemented. In 2005, he was elected chair of the Carter Center at Emory University, succeeding Jimmy Carter. Most recently, Moores is a member of the board of trustees for the Blum Center for Developing Economies at the University of California, Berkeley. The center is focused on finding solutions to address the crisis of extreme poverty and disease in the developing world.

Moores is also the founder of the River Blindness Foundation, a non-profit organisation dedicated to research and treatment of Onchocerciasis, the second most common cause of infectious blindness.

In 2016, Moores began negotiations to buy English soccer club Nottingham Forest, with a view to buying between 80% and 100% of the shares from Kuwaiti owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi for a reported $61.87 million. However, the deal unexpectedly collapsed at the eleventh hour, with no clear reason given by either party.

==Personal life ==
In February 2008, Moores&#x27; wife Becky filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Moores gave up ownership of the family home on a golf course at Pebble Beach, California. The property overlooked the Pacific and the 18th fairway of the golf course. The divorce also prompted a major overhaul of the San Diego Padres roster, followed by the sale of Moores&#x27;s majority ownership of the Major League Baseball team. During the divorce proceedings, Moores spent the majority of his time in Texas, and refused to attend Padres and San Diego State games, while his wife regularly attended Padres games. In 2013, Moores married Dianne Rosenberg.

<text>HMS &quot;Alnwick Castle&quot; was one of 44 s built for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. She was named after Alnwick Castle in Northumberland. Completed in late 1944, the ship served as a convoy escort until the end of the war, helping to sink one German submarine. The corvette was placed in reserve after the war and was sold for scrap in 1958.

==Design and description==
The Castle-class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding Flower class, enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by a pair of triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The &quot;Castle&quot;s carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 99 officers and ratings.

The Castle-class ships were equipped with a single QF Mk XVI gun forward, but their primary weapon was their single three-barrel Squid anti-submarine mortar. This was backed up by one depth charge rail and two throwers for 15 depth charges. The ships were fitted with two twin and a pair of single mounts for Oerlikon light AA guns. Provision was made for a further four single mounts if needed. They were equipped with Type 145Q and Type 147B ASDIC sets to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water. A Type 277 search radar and a HF/DF radio direction finder rounded out the Castles&#x27; sensor suite.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Alnwick Castle&quot; was laid down by George Brown &amp; Co. at their shipyard at Greenock on 12 June 1943 and launched on 23 May 1944. She was completed on 11 November and served as a convoy escort until the end of the Second World War in May 1945.

On 17 February 1945, &quot;Alnwick Castle&quot;, Lt. Cdr. H.A. Stonehouse R.N.R., and used depth charges to sink German submarine U-425 near Murmansk.

&quot;Alnwick Castle&quot; was placed in reserve on 25 May and was sold for scrap in 1958. She arrived at Gateshead in December to be broken up.

<text>The Girl from U.N.C.L.E. is an American spy fiction TV series starring Stefanie Powers that aired on NBC for one season from September 13, 1966, to April 11, 1967. The series was a spin-off from &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and used the same theme music composed by Jerry Goldsmith, in a different arrangement by Dave Grusin. &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; stars Powers as American U.N.C.L.E. agent April Dancer and Noel Harrison as her British partner, Mark Slate. Leo G. Carroll plays their superior, Alexander Waverly.

Despite attempts at cross-promotion with its parent series, the show failed to build an audience and lasted only one season. Its failure was considered a contributing factor in &quot;Man&quot;″s mid-season cancellation in early 1968.

==Critical response==
Contemporary reviews of &quot;The Girl From Uncle&quot; were mostly negative, with much of the critics&#x27; comments centered upon the lead actors, particularly Powers. A review in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; noted that Powers is &quot;prettier and shapelier than Ilya Kuryakin, of course, but she&#x27;s not much of an actress and she&#x27;s ill-suited to the role,&quot; but that &quot;Harrison tends to steal scenes from Miss Powers, and [makes] an agreeable impression&quot; A review in &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that &quot;Miss Powers, for all of her sweater appeal, is a trifle limited.&quot; Kay Gardella of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; opined that Powers &quot;display[ed] less than undergraduate skill in the fine art of spying&quot;, with the performance of co-star Harrison being &quot;the understatement of the new season. One suspected he was given a dose of Apathy.&quot; The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; commented that &quot;Powers [is] somewhat of a timid UNCLE agent,&quot; that Harrison &quot;gave evidence of stealing most of the credits,&quot; and that &quot;the series is [...] only for UNCLE fans.&quot;

==Episodes==
===Backdoor pilot (1966)===
The backdoor pilot, titled &quot;The Moonglow Affair&quot;, originally aired as 52nd episode (S02E23) of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; on February 25, 1966.

===Season 1 (1966–1967)===
==Syndication==

Beginning in 1968, reruns of all 29 episodes of &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, including 99 of 105 of its parent series, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, were combined into a 128-episode syndication package in the United States. Years later, a few more episodes were added to the package, rounding it out to 132.

==Home media==
On August 23, 2011, Warner Bros. released the complete series in two parts on DVD in Region 1 via their Warner Archive Collection. The two 4-disc collections contain all 29 episodes of the series.
These are Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) releases, available exclusively through Warner&#x27;s online store and only in the United States.

==Soundtrack==
Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s theme for &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; was adapted for the series by Dave Grusin in an energetic variation. Of the 29 episodes, eight had complete original scores and six were partial scores, with the rest being tracked by the previously written material.

Grusin wrote four complete scores (&quot;The Dog-Gone Affair&quot;, &quot;The Mother Muffin Affair&quot;, &quot;The Mata Hari Affair&quot; and &quot;The Furnace Flats Affair&quot;), Richard Shores — who would be the principal composer for &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E&quot; the following season — wrote three (&quot;The Montori Device Affair,&quot; &quot;The Prisoner of Zalamar Affair&quot; and &quot;The Danish Blue Affair&quot;) and Jack Marshall composed his only score for either &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; series with &quot;The Horns-of-the-Dilemma Affair&quot;. Jeff Alexander, also writing his only &quot;U.N.C.L.E.&quot; music, provided a partial score for &quot;The Garden of Evil Affair&quot;, sharing &quot;Music Score by&quot; credit with Grusin and Shores, the latter two sharing the credit on all the other episodes, tracked and partial score alike. The opening and closing title themes and suites from the episodes &quot;The Dog-Gone Affair&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner of Zalamar Affair&quot;, &quot;The Mother Muffin Affair&quot;, &quot;The Mata Hari Affair&quot;, &quot;The Montori Device Affair&quot; and &quot;The Horns-of-the-Dilemma Affair&quot; are included on the third FSM album of music from &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;

==Original novels==

&quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; was featured in five original novels, only two of which were published in the United States:
*&quot;The Birds of a Feather Affair&quot; by Michael Avallone
*&quot;The Blazing Affair&quot; by Michael Avallone
*&quot;The Global Globules Affair&quot; – Simon Latter (published in United Kingdom, and in France as &quot;L&#x27;affaire des Globules&quot;)
*&quot;The Golden Boats of Taradata Affair&quot; – Simon Latter (published in United Kingdom only)
*&quot;The Cornish Pixie Affair&quot; – Peter Leslie (published in United Kingdom only)

Unlike the series, the novels were quite serious, with the plot of &quot;The Birds of a Feather Affair&quot; ending in tragedy for April when the &quot;innocent&quot; character usually featured in the TV show dies, despite what April does to stop the villains. In addition, the prohibition on April using deadly force on the TV series (described earlier) did not apply to the novels.

A &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E. Annual&quot; was published for three issues in the UK, which included novellas not published elsewhere. Gold Key Comics also published a short-lived, five-issue comic book.

<text>Johann Ernst Eberlin (27 March 1702 – 19 June 1762) was a German composer and organist whose works bridge the baroque and classical eras. He was a composer of church organ and choral music. Marpurg claims he wrote as much and as rapidly as Alessandro Scarlatti and Georg Philipp Telemann, a claim also repeated by Leopold Mozart - though Eberlin did not live nearly as long as either of those two composers.

==Biography==
Eberlin&#x27;s first musical training began in 1712 at the Jesuit Gymnasium of St. Salvator in Augsburg. His teachers there were Georg Egger and Balthasar Siberer, who taught him how to play the organ. He began his university education in 1721 at the Benedictine University in Salzburg where he studied law, but from 1723 turned to music.

His first breakthrough was in 1727 when he became the organist for Count Leopold von Firmian (then Archbishop of Salzburg). He reached the peak of his career when he was the organist for Archbishop Andreas Jakob von Dietrichstein. By 1749 he held the posts of Hof- und Domkapellmeister (Court and Cathedral chapel master) simultaneously, an achievement which his successors Michael Haydn, Leopold Mozart, and Mozart himself were not to match. Despite Leopold Mozart&#x27;s great opinion of Eberlin, and having sent his son some of Eberlin&#x27;s best-known works, his keyboard pieces, the young Mozart later tired of them, writing in a letter of 20 April 1782 that Eberlin&#x27;s works were &quot;far too trivial to deserve a place beside Handel and Bach.&quot;

Eberlin composed industriously and played at church concerts. After his death, though, his strict choral pieces in the &quot;stile antico&quot; faded from popularity and only his keyboard works were (to a limited extent) remembered. 

His contemporaries included Anton Cajetan Adlgasser.

== Works, editions, recordings ==
Eberlin composed toccatas and fugues, masses including the , cantatas, a Requiem, psalm settings and operas. He composed oratorios in German on librettos by Metastasio:
* (1750s)
* (The Passion of Jesus Christ, Salzburg 1755)
* (St. Helena on the Calvary, Salzburg, probably between 1753 and 1763).

Editions
* &quot;Johann Ernst Eberlin: Te Deum, Dixit Dominus, and Magnificat&quot; Reinhard G Pauly. 1971

Recordings

<doc id="1239298" wikidata="Q547784" url="?curid=1239298" title="Super Proton Synchrotron">
<text>The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is a particle accelerator of the synchrotron type at CERN. It is housed in a circular tunnel, in circumference, straddling the border of France and Switzerland near Geneva, Switzerland.

==History==

The SPS was designed by a team led by John Adams, director-general of what was then known as Laboratory II. Originally specified as a 300 GeV accelerator, the SPS was actually built to be capable of 400 GeV, an operating energy it achieved on the official commissioning date of 17 June 1976. However, by that time, this energy had been exceeded by Fermilab, which reached an energy of 500 GeV on 14 May of that year.

The SPS has been used to accelerate protons and antiprotons, electrons and positrons (for use as the injector for the Large Electron–Positron Collider (LEP)), and heavy ions.

From 1981 to 1991, the SPS operated as a hadron (more precisely, proton–antiproton) collider (as such it was called SpS), when its beams provided the data for the UA1 and UA2 experiments, which resulted in the discovery of the W and Z bosons. These discoveries and a new technique for cooling particles led to a Nobel Prize for Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer in 1984.

From 2006 to 2012, the SPS was used by the CNGS experiment to produce a neutrino beam to be detected at the Gran Sasso laboratory in Italy, 730 km from CERN.

==Current operations==

The SPS is now used as the final injector for high-intensity proton beams for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which began preliminary operation on 10 September 2008, for which it accelerates protons from 26 GeV to 450 GeV. The LHC itself then accelerates them to several teraelectronvolts (TeV).

Operation as injector still allows continuation of the ongoing fixed-target research program, where the SPS is used to provide 400 GeV proton beams for a number of active fixed-target experiments, notably COMPASS, NA61/SHINE and NA62.

The SPS has served, and continues to be used as a test bench for new concepts in accelerator physics. In 1999 it served as an observatory for the electron cloud phenomenon. In 2003, SPS was the first machine where the Hamiltonian resonance driving terms were directly measured. And in 2004, experiments to cancel the detrimental effects of beam encounters (like those in the LHC) were carried out.

The SPS RF cavities operate at a center frequency of 200.2 MHz.

==Major discoveries==
Major scientific discoveries made by experiments that operated at the SPS include the following.

*1983: The discovery of W and Z bosons in the UA1 and UA2 experiments. The 1984 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer for the developments that led to this discovery.
*1999: The discovery of direct CP violation by the NA48 experiment.

==Upgrade for high luminosity LHC==
The Large Hadron Collider will require an upgrade to considerably increase its luminosity during the 2020s. This would require upgrades to the entire linac/pre-injector/injector chain, including the SPS.

As part of this, the SPS will need to be able to handle a much higher intensity beam. One improvement considered in the past was increasing the extraction energy to 1 TeV. However, the extraction energy will be kept at 450 GeV while other systems are upgraded. The acceleration system will be modified to handle the higher voltages needed to accelerate a higher intensity beam. The beam dumping system will also be upgraded so it can accept a higher intensity beam without sustaining significant damage.

<text>Thomas Bernard Heppner (born January 14, 1956) is a renowned Canadian tenor and broadcaster, now retired from singing, who specialized in opera and other classical works for voice.

==Early life==
Heppner, was born in Murrayville, British Columbia, and lived in Dawson Creek, British Columbia. His family were Mennonites.

He began his musical studies at the University of British Columbia and first attracted national attention when he won the CBC Talent Festival in 1979. He later studied opera at University of Toronto.

==Career==
Heppner won the Metropolitan Opera Auditions in 1988 which launched his career in major productions world wide.

He is associated with the Wagnerian repertoire, but he performed a range of operas from the German, French and Italian canons.

Heppner performed frequently with opera companies in the United States (including the New York Metropolitan Opera) and Europe, and concert appearances with symphony orchestras.

Heppner achieved renown with the 1993 recording of Wagner&#x27;s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch and the Bavarian State Orchestra.

He has appeared in the DVD recordings of the Met&#x27;s productions of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, three of his signature roles.

He first performed Tristan with the Seattle Opera in 1998, and in November 1998 with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Claudio Abbado. Heppner also performed and recorded Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Gotterdammerung&quot; with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.

He specialized in operatic roles including the title part in &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, the title part in &quot;Otello&quot;, and Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Aeneas&quot;. Heppner recorded Wagner&#x27;s Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg in 1995 with Sir Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He performed Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; at the Salzburg Festival with Solti in 1996, which would be the conductor&#x27;s final operatic performances, and recorded the work that same year with Sir Colin Davis conducting. Also with Sir Colin Davis, Heppner recorded the role of Aeneas in Berlioz&#x27; &quot;Les Troyens&quot;.

Heppner has recorded on multiple labels, participating in complete operas and solo albums of arias and songs. He was signed to an exclusive contract with Deutsche Grammophon (DG). His first solo recording for DG, made in 2001, was &quot;Airs Français&quot;. It won a Juno Award.

==Honours==
Heppner has received Honorary Doctorates from Queen&#x27;s University (2006), McMaster Divinity College (2005), York University (2003), Memorial University of Newfoundland (2003), University of Toronto (2002), McGill University (2002), and University of British Columbia (1997).

Heppner was awarded the National Arts Centre Award, a companion award of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards in 1995. He was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1999, was promoted to Officer in 2002 and Companion in 2008. He performed at closing ceremonies of two Winter Olympic Games. In Turin in 2006, he sang the Canadian national anthem. Four years later, in Vancouver, he sang the Olympic Hymn. Both times, he mixed English and French. In June 2016, Heppner was made a laureate of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards, with a Lifetime Achievement Award in Classical Music.

==Retirement==
Heppner announced his retirement from singing in April 2014. Heppner felt unable to be a &quot;part-time singer&quot;, feeling that &quot;No matter how often you sing, if you&#x27;re going to sing at a good level, a quality level, you&#x27;ve got to keep it up all the time. And I was finding that to be a little bit difficult. So that, plus the fact that I&#x27;ve been experiencing a little bit of unreliability in my voiceand that causes some anxietiesI decided it was time&quot;.

Post-retirement, Heppner accepted a brief role in a musical production of &quot;Titanic&quot; at the Princess of Wales Theatre in Toronto in May 2015.

Heppner became a broadcaster on Canadian radio, hosting &quot;Saturday Afternoon at the Opera&quot; and &quot;Backstage with Ben Heppner&quot; on CBC Radio. He retired from broadcasting in September 2021.

Heppner plans to continue hosting master classes and coaching singers for roles, and appearing on voice competition juries. The Ben Heppner Vocal Music Academy, a public school in Scarborough, named after Heppner, opened in 2012.

<doc id="1239301" wikidata="Q735665" url="?curid=1239301" title="Bedir Khan Beg">
<text>Bedir Khan Beg (Kurmanji: &quot;Bedirxan Beg&quot;, ; 1803–1869) was the last Kurdish Mir and mütesellim of the Emirate of Botan.

Hereditary head of the house of Rozhaki whose seat was the ancient Bitlis Castle and descended from Sharafkhan Bidlisi, Bedir Khan was born in Cizre (now in Turkey) of Azizan family. He became the Mir of the Emirate of Botan in 1821 and ruled until 1847. The Bedir Khans also claimed descent from Muhammad&#x27;s general Khalid ibn al-Walid.

== Early life ==
He was born to Abdullah Bey, and became the ruler of Botan after his cousin Sayfuddin (who succeeded Abdullah Bey after his death), wasn&#x27;t able to calm down the region and his brother Said Bey was too religious and left the leadership to Bedir Khan. During his first term as Mir, he soon established a regional control strong enough, that allowed him to deny his support to the Ottoman Sultan during the Russo-Turkish War between 1828 and 1829. He managed to develop the war-torn districts under his control and within years, the population in the area in his control grew significantly. His success was such, that European diplomats from the region reported to their governments about Bedir Khans ability to provide his followers with a good economic standard and security, comparing with other neighboring regions. Bedir Khan was proud of the security he brought to the region, that under his leadership, banditry had disappeared and caravans were able to cross his territory in safety. Bedir Khan Beg was repeatedly responsible for massacres of the Yazidis. In 1832, thousands of Yazidis were killed in the Shekhan area by Bedir Khan Beg in cooperation with the Kurdish Soran prince Muhammad Pasha of Rawanduz. But he was not always on good terms with Muhammad Pahsa, in 1834, his army had to defend the Emirate from him. In 1836, the Ottomans attacked and defeated him, and Bedir Khan renewed his vow of allegiance to the Sultan In 1838, the Ottoman Reshid Pasha conquered Cizre and Bedir Khan began to lose his power due to the centralist policies of the Ottoman Empire, which culminated in the Tanzimat Edict of 1839 and its application the following year. Following the Battle of Nizip in 1839, in which Bedir Khan took part for the Ottoman side, he emerged as the dominant Kurdish ruler in central Kurdistan. He raised taxes, minted his own coins and organized the justice system. The security in Bohtan gave him such popularity among its habitants, that many families from neighboring districts settled in the Emirate of Bohtan. This led to a dispute with the Vali of Mosul, who in 1842 wanted to integrate the district of Cizre into the province of Mosul, an aim, to which the population of Cizre did not agree to. By 1845, Bedir Khan beg ruled over a region spanning from Diyarbakir to Mosul in the west to Urmia in the east. As it was known that he had planned the modernization of his troops by creating cross-tribal militias constituted by soldiers of several tribes and that the friday sermons were shouted in his name, the central Ottoman Government decided to end the emerging independence movement of Bedir Khan.

== Triple alliance ==
Following the Battle of Nizip, Bedir Khan allied himself with Han Mahmud of Müküs and Nurullah Bey of Hakkari in 1840 to a triple alliance. As the Ottomans decided to detach Cizre from Diyarbakir and have it joined to the Mosul Eyalet, Bedr Khan opposed the decision and would not submit to the authority of the Vali of Mosul. In the meantime, Han Mahmoud of Müküs unsuccessfully attempted to conquer the area around Bitlis. The triple alliance entered in conflict with the local Assyrian Christian population, and perpetrated massacres amongst them in 1843 and 1846. The conflict arose, as Nestorians in the area between Urmia, Mosul and Hakkari, decided to refuse their accorded tribute to the Emir of Hakkari in 1841. After Nurullah Bey unsuccessfully attempted to subdue the Nestorians led by Shimun XVII Abraham, he called for the assistance by Bedir Khan Beg. In 1843, Bedir Khan broke their resistance and Mar Shimun took refuge in Mosul. And also in 1844 in the Tur Abdin mountains, Yazidis were again raided by Bedir Khan Beg. Bedir Khan Beg&#x27;s goal was to force the Yazidis to convert to Islam.

Pressure from the European Powers to stop the massacres of Christians led to Ottoman forces invading his territories in 1846–7, with Omer Pasha&#x27;s 12,000 strong Ottoman force, which was supported by Yezidi tribesmen seeking revenge, defeating the Kurdish army in the field near Zeitun, Cizre. At the beginning of the conflict he was able to beat the Ottomans, but as an important commander of his troops, defected to the Ottomans, he was forced to flee to Evruh castle, where he endured an eight months long siege. Bedir Khan had to surrender to the Ottomans at Evreh Castle in Eruh, Siirt on the 4 July 1847. The same day also Han Mahmud was defeated in Tatvan. Bedir Khan was betrayed by Yezdanşer a distant relative and high ranking commander of his forces, who had joined the Ottoman Army in exchange of promises of a rank in the government. Yezdanşer would become appointed the mütesellim of Cizre for a short time. From Evreh castle Bedir Khan and his family were put in chains and taken to Kumçati in the Şırnak province. After 40 days in detention, Bedir Khan and his family were transferred to Constantinople.

== Exile in Crete ==
After Bedir Khan&#x27;s hopes that he would be allowed to settle in Constantinople were not fulfilled, he and his entourage were sent to Heraklion, Crete, which at the time was governed by the Ottoman Empire. In 1853 he requested twice to be allowed to return to Istanbul, but his demands were turned down. In 1855 he purchased a farm just outside of Heraklion, which he named “Kabıl Hora“. As in 1856 a strong earthquake occurred in Crete, he faced financial calamities due to the destructions of his possessions. His salary which he still received from the Ottoman Empire, was only 7000 Kuruş. After Bedir Khan managed to solve the quarrels between the Christians and Muslims on the island, the situation became better. In September 1857, Sultan Abdul Majid changed his approach towards Bedir Khan, doubling his salary, and granting 43 of his followers to return to Kurdistan. Nevertheless, Bedir Khan decided to stay in Crete.

== Return and death ==
In 1863, Sultan Abdul Aziz, the successor of Abdul Majid, allowed Bedir Khan and his family to settle in Istanbul, where they bought a mansion in the Fatih quarter. Several of his descendants were admitted into the bureaucracy of the Ottoman Empire. In June 1868, Bedir Khan decided to settle in present-day Syria. He traveled by ship to Beirut and from there he moved to Damascus. Bedir Khan Beg died a year after he settled in Damascus. His funeral was held at the cemetery of Rukneddin, Damascus.

== Family ==
Bedir Khan Beg was married several times, according to his son Mehmed, he had sixteen wives. Emin Ali Bedir Khan is one of his sons and Celadet Bedir Khan, Süreyya Bedir Khan and Kamuran Alî Bedirxan are his grandchildren. He was the father of twenty-one children.

<doc id="1239305" wikidata="Q7061619" url="?curid=1239305" title="Norwood Football Club">
<text>Norwood Football Club, nicknamed the Redlegs, is an Australian rules football club competing in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) in the state of South Australia. Its home ground is Coopers Stadium (Norwood Oval), which is often referred to as &quot;The Parade&quot;. It is one of the two traditional powerhouse clubs of the SANFL, the other being Port Adelaide, who together have won half of all SANFL premierships (see Port Adelaide–Norwood SANFL rivalry). The club has won 31 SANFL premierships and 1 SANFLW premiership.

==History==

===1878–1899: Nineteenth-century powerhouse===
The Norwood Football Club was formed at a meeting held at the Norfolk Arms Hotel in Rundle Street, Adelaide on 28 February 1878: it was resolved that the club colours would be those of the old Woodville Club.
At a subsequent meeting with 12 members present at the Norfolk Arms Hotel on 14 March the colours were confirmed as blue guernseys and knickerbockers, and red stockings and cap.
The new club gained a number of leading players from the then recently dissolved Woodville Football Club (1868–1877), including its Captain J.R. (Joe) Osborn who would become Norwood&#x27;s inaugural Captain.

Norwood&#x27;s first home ground was the current CBC College oval in the east Park Lands near the tramway and opposite the Kent Town Brewery.

Norwood played their first SAFA match against South Adelaide at Adelaide Oval on 16 May 1878, who were the current reigning premiers from the inaugural season: Norwood went on to win the match 1 goal to nil, with future Australian Test cricketer and Captain George Giffen kicking Norwood&#x27;s goal from a running kick. During this match the players donned distinctive red stockings which gave rise to the nickname &#x27;Redlegs&#x27;, the moniker which has remained synonymous with Norwood ever since.

Norwood won a premiership in its first year of existence and then followed with five more in a row. Only Port Adelaide in 1954–1959 has managed to repeat the feat of winning six premierships in a row. Norwood eventually won 11 pennants between 1878 and 1899 and was the most successful team of the 19th century. In 1883, after winning the pennant for the sixth successive year, Norwood became the first South Australian club to record a win over a Victorian team, when it defeated Essendon. In 1888, Norwood were proclaimed &#x27;Premiers of Australia&#x27; when they defeated South Melbourne in three matches at Kensington Oval.

Norwood and Port Adelaide became famous rivals after a particularly tough match in 1894.

Early champions of the club include Alfred &#x27;Topsy&#x27; Waldron, who captained the club for nine years; Alby Green, the first player to win the Magarey Medal for the best and fairest player in the competition in 1898; and Anthony &#x27;Bos&#x27; Daly, who kicked 88 goals in 1893, including an astonishing 23 goals in one match. Daly&#x27;s goal tally would not be surpassed for another 37 years, and his tally of 23 goals in one match has only ever been equalled by the great North Adelaide full forward goal kicker Ken Farmer in 1940. Daly was widely regarded as &quot;the greatest South Australian footballer from 1877 to the close of the nineteenth century&quot;.

===1900–1915: pre-WWI era===

The 1904 Grand Final was a memorable one for Norwood who were down by 35 points at three-quarter time against traditional rival Port Adelaide. Norwood then produced an extraordinary burst of football with a goal by centre half forward Dean Dawson followed by two goals each from full forward, Bill Miller and half forward flanker, Stan Robinson. Norwood was only two points down with a minute remaining. Tommy Gibbons held a mark on a seemingly impossible angle. His kick sailed through the goal posts to give Norwood a four-point victory 9.8 to 8.10.
Norwood were proclaimed the Champions of Australia again in 1907 when they defeated the Victorian premier, Carlton, 13.12 to 8.9 after Norwood scored 7 goals in the first 20 minutes of the third quarter. Norwood would beat Carlton again in 1921, but on this latter occasion both clubs were runners up in their respective competitions.

===1919–1944: Interwar period and WWII competition===

====1922–1924: Thomas Leahy success====
For his brief coaching stint, Thomas Leahy proved remarkably successful, leading the Redlegs to back to back premierships in 1922 and 1923, a feat that would not be repeated for 90 years.

====1925–1929: Walter Scott era====
Walter Scott was captain-coach of the Norwood Football Club for five years, leading his team to two grand finals in 1928 and 1929, winning the latter against Port Adelaide.

===1945–1956: Jack Oatey era===
Over a coaching stint of 12 years, Jack Oatey led the Redlegs to three premierships in 1946, 1948, 1950.

===1957–1973: Premiership drought===
The period spanning the 1951 and 1973 seasons, totalling twenty three years, was the club&#x27;s longest without a premiership.

===1974–1979: Robert Hammond era===

====1977: NFL night series premiers====

Robert Hammond would lead the Redlegs to two premierships, one in 1975 and the other in 1978.

In 1977, Norwood defeated East Perth for the NFL night series premiership. Both of these clubs would later make bids to enter the VFL: East Perth in 1980 and Norwood in 1986. Norwood would go on to win the game 10.9 (69) to East Perth&#x27;s 9.7 (61). This would be Norwood&#x27;s third and last title in a national competition. Norwood were awarded $50,000 () for their win.

====1978: 100 years of the Norwood Football Club====

1978 was Norwood&#x27;s centenary year and Sturt, heading into the grand final, had lost only one game for the year and was odds-on favourite to win its 8th flag in 13 years. Norwood was 29 points down at three-quarter time but scored seven goals to Sturt&#x27;s two in the last quarter to win the premiership by one point. Memorable moments in the match include Neil Button&#x27;s effort in ruck against Sturt&#x27;s Rick Davies, John Wynne&#x27;s charge into the Sturt coaches box, Michael Taylor&#x27;s mark 1 metre out from Sturt&#x27;s goal with a minute to go, Danny Jenkin&#x27;s leaping smother of a shot for goal with just seconds left to play and Brian Adamson&#x27;s five goals from centre half forward. However, the most controversial moment was when field umpire Des Foster awarded a mark to Norwood’s Phil Gallagher in the dying seconds of the final quarter, that resulted in a goal by Gallagher which gave Norwood a 1 point lead that would hold to the final siren.

===1980–1990: Neil Balme era===
Under the leadership of Western Australian Neil Balme, the Redlegs won two premierships, one in 1982 and a second in 1984. The 1984 premiership was notable as the side came from 5th position at the end of the minor round to win the Grand Final, the first time a team outside the top four had won the competition. Two distinguished Norwood players from this era are Michael Aish and Garry McIntosh.

===1991–1997: National League expansion===

====1991–1995: Neil Craig era====
With the formation of the Adelaide Crows, the number of the SANFL&#x27;s best players leaving the competition skyrocketed. The Norwood Football Club was hit particularly hard just avoiding the wooden spoon in successive years. However to the credit of Neil Craig, he managed to make do with what was at his disposal and in his third year as senior Redlegs coach the side made the 1993 Grand Final. However, timing was to be unfortunate and the Redlegs found themselves up against the recently created Woodville-West Torrens Eagles who were by far the strongest team of the year, losing by a club record 73 points.

====1996–1999: Peter Rohde era====
The Norwood Football Club entered the 1997 SANFL season, helmed by coach Peter Rohde, with purpose and rage that would see it dominate the years competition. During the home-and-away season, the club lost only three games during the minor round with a percentage of 64.82%, second to only that of Port Adelaide&#x27;s 1914 season percentage of 68.78%. The dominance of Norwood during this year was highlighted on ANZAC day when Norwood played the second-placed team of the year, Port Adelaide, winning by 122 points. However, during the second semi-final, Norwood lost to Port Adelaide. The loss proved to be a wake-up call for a side seemingly winning with ease.
 The following week, a win over Central District saw them make the Grand Final, where again they would play Port Adelaide, this time in front of 44,161 eager spectators. Norwood were no longer complacent like they had been a couple weeks ago, and they dished out Port Adelaide&#x27;s greatest-ever grand final defeat in the SANFL, winning by 73 points, 19.12 (126) to 7.11 (53). With midfielders Anthony Harvey (Jack Oatey Medallist), John Cunningham and Andrew Jarman playing superbly, the Redlegs had their Magpie opponents chasing shadows all afternoon. Norwood&#x27;s victory, which came during the same season Port Adelaide&#x27;s controversial bid to enter the AFL came to fruition, meant the satisfaction it generated amongst Redleg supporters was euphoric.

===2000–2009: Tough times===
The euphoria of the 1997 grand final victory would be short-lived, with the club only making it to another grand final once in the next decade, losing to Port Adelaide. The decade would see club revenue reduced to its minimum extent as the AFL took an economic hold of football in the state. During this time, the club picked up its 6th wooden spoon and its first for over three decades.

===2010–2013: Nathan Bassett and Norwood resurgence===
Norwood won their 28th and 29th SANFL premierships in 2012 and 2013 by defeating West Adelaide and North Adelaide respectively and lost only five minor-round games over those two years (two in 2012, three in 2013). It was the first time in 90 years (1922 and 1923) that the club had won back-to-back premierships. By coincidence, Norwood defeated Wests in 1922 and North in 1923.

===2014–2016: Ben Warren as coach===

In his first season as coach Ben Warren, with recruiting restrictions due to a salary cap breach and the loss of 12 premiership players, managed to guide the club to a Grand Final, in which Norwood defeated its biggest rival by 4 points, Norwood 12.10 (82) Port Adelaide 11.12 (78), in front of the largest Grand Final crowd for 15 years of 38,644. The win was significant given that the Port Adelaide team of 21 included 19 full-time professional AFL-listed players. It was also Norwood&#x27;s 30th premiership, and completed a hat-trick following on from its 2012 and 2013 flags. The victory left Norwood as the team that won both the last Grand Final at Football Park and the first Grand Final at the newly refurbished Adelaide Oval.

In 2015, Norwood started the season 9–1 despite losing their captain Kieran McGuinness to retirement along with Gavin Hughes over the off-season, Anthony Wilson to the Adelaide Crows and Steven Baldasso suffering a season ending knee injury during the pre-season. The Redlegs were top of the ladder after Round 10 but a loss to bottom side Glenelg in round 11 would prove pivotal as they fell away in the second half of the season to only win 2 of their remaining 9 games with an horrific run of injuries to key players. They finished 4th after the minor round with 11–7, equal third with West Adelaide, but with inferior percentage were sent to an Elimination Final and were bundled out by 44 points by Central District.

The 2016 season saw the Redlegs regain Andrew Kirwan from overseas, Matt Fuller, Anthony Wilson and Jaryd Cachia from AFL duties but this did not cover the losses of James Allan, Michael Newton, Liam Davis and Mat Suckling, all to retirement, with Andrew McInnes and Mitch Wilkins returning to Melbourne after only one year and Kane Murphy returning to Sydney. The Redlegs started well with a win over archrivals, Port Adelaide, at Coopers Stadium by 25 points with Simon Phillips copping a season ending shoulder injury. A shock loss to North Adelaide by 57 points was the start of things to come as the Redlegs struggled with many injuries throughout the year which started with Michael Chippendale missing for the first six weeks and then significant injuries to key players in Bode, Panos, Cachia, Phillips and Webber throughout the year saw the Redlegs struggle without their star players. Norwood managed to win three of their last six games of the season with a shock win over ladder leaders, Woodville-West Torrens, by 24 points at Coopers Stadium which was the Redlegs stand out game in a poor season. This led to the departure of their Senior Coach, Ben Warren, with both parties not being able to come to an agreement over the club&#x27;s future. Ben Warren ended with a win–loss record of 31–27.

===2017–present: Evolution===
Norwood were a foundation member of the SANFL Women&#x27;s (SANFLW) competition in 2017. They claimed their first (and currently only) premiership in the competition in the inaugural 2017 season.

==Tradition==
The Norwood Football Club is one of two traditional power-house clubs in the South Australian National Football League, the other team being the Port Adelaide Football Club. As a result, their rivalry was the biggest in South Australian sport for over 100 years before the arrival of the Showdown. The two clubs still consistently attract the largest crowds during the SANFL minor round.

==Hall of Fame==
In 2006, the Norwood Football Club board wrote a charter to establish a club Hall of Fame and Hall of Fame Committee, with the express purpose of &quot;recognis[ing] and enshrin[ing] players, coaches, volunteers, honorary officials and administrators who have made a most significant contribution to the Norwood Football Club since its inception in 1878.&quot; The Hall of Fame Committee were tasked with selecting a maximum of 30 members for the inaugural induction ceremony, with up to 25 players and up to five coaches, volunteers, honorary officials or administrators from across the broad history of Norwood. Like other SANFL clubs, the charter initially adopted the practice of using broad historical eras to categorize members; in the case of Norwood, five eras were outlined: a) 1878 to 1906; b) 1907 to 1941; c) 1946 to 1969; d) 1970 to 1990; and e) 1991 and onwards. The Committee were also tasked with expanding the Hall of Fame by admitting up to five new members each year. There are currently 63 members in the Norwood Hall of Fame. In 2018, five of those members were upgraded to Legend status. The categorization below follows that of the club&#x27;s history website, &quot;Redlegs Museum&quot;.

<text>Stanford Stadium is an outdoor college football stadium on the west coast of the United States, located on the campus of Stanford University in Stanford, California. It is the home of the Stanford Cardinal and hosts the university&#x27;s commencement exercises. Opened in 1921 as a football and track and field stadium, it was an earthen horseshoe with wooden bleacher seating and flooring upon a steel frame. Its original seating capacity was 60,000, which grew to 89,000 by 1927 as a nearly enclosed bowl.

Immediately following the 2005 season, the stadium was demolished and rebuilt as a dual-deck concrete structure, without a track. Today, it seats 50,424. The natural grass playing field runs northwest to southeast, at an approximate elevation of above sea level.

==Early history==

Stanford Stadium was built in five months in 1921 and opened its gates on November 19, replacing Stanford Field. The first game was against rival California, who defeated Stanford 42–7 in the Big Game. Seating capacity was originally 60,000, with a 66-row, U-Shaped structure second only to the Yale Bowl in size at the time.

In 1925, 10,200 seats were added to the stadium, nearly enclosing the horseshoe while still keeping the overall height of the facility intact. In 1927, fourteen additional rows of seating were added, increasing the stadium to its maximum capacity of 85,500, with eighty rows of seating. In 1932, the stadium hosted the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. In 1935, Stanford Stadium set a record (for the time) for single-game attendance, with 94,000 spectators filling it for a 13–0 victory over California.

===NFL===
In January 1985, Super Bowl XIX was held in Stanford Stadium, with the Bay Area&#x27;s own San Francisco 49ers defeating the Miami Dolphins, 38–16.

As of 2021, Stanford Stadium is one of two venues (the Rose Bowl being the other) to host a Super Bowl without previously serving as the home stadium of a National Football League (NFL) or American Football League (AFL) team, and Super Bowl XIX is one of only three Super Bowls where the host region saw its team win (the others being Super Bowl LV and Super Bowl LVI, where the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Los Angeles Rams respectively became the first two teams to play and win a Super Bowl at their home stadiums).

On October 22, 1989, the San Francisco 49ers played a home game at the stadium against the New England Patriots, as Candlestick Park had suffered serious damage following the Loma Prieta earthquake five days earlier.

===Soccer===
The stadium has hosted soccer matches for the 1984 Summer Olympics as one of three venues outside southern California for that Olympics, the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

Major League Soccer&#x27;s San Jose Earthquakes have hosted one match at the stadium each year since 2011. The first year&#x27;s opponent was the New York Red Bulls; since 2012, the Earthquakes have used the stadium to host their home leg of the California Clásico versus the Los Angeles Galaxy.

; 1994 FIFA World Cup matches
; 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup match
===Other international soccer matches===
===Other notable events===
Other high-profile events hosted at Stanford Stadium include Herbert Hoover&#x27;s acceptance speech for the 1928 Republican Presidential nomination and the 1962 edition of the long-running (1958–1985) series of track meets between the United States and the Soviet Union. Coldplay will play at the stadium on May 31 and June 1, 2025 as part of their Music of the Spheres World Tour, making them the first act to hold two shows there on a single tour.

==Modern renovations==

The stadium has undergone a number of significant renovations since the 1920s. In 1960, a press box was added, while the first, and last synthetic athletics track was installed in 1978 (replacing the cinder track that had been used for many years).

In 1985, prior to Super Bowl XIX, the press box was renovated, new locker rooms were installed, a ticket complex and dressing room for game officials were added, and the number of restrooms were increased.

In 1994, prior to the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the lower level of the press box was expanded and aluminum benches were installed throughout the stadium. The crown of the playing surface was also reduced.

In 1995, a $10 million gift from Los Angeles insurance executive and 1935 Stanford graduate Louis W. Foster enabled further updates to the stadium, including widening the concourse, improving the restrooms, and replacing the remaining wooden seats. In honor of his gift, Stanford named the playing surface the Louis W. Foster Family Field at Stanford Stadium.

===2005–2006 demolition and reconstruction===

In June 2005, the university board of trustees authorized plans for the stadium&#x27;s demolition and reconstruction that would remove the track, reduce the stadium capacity, and bring it up to date with present standards for sporting venues. Various justifications for the renovation included poor sightlines in the existing stadium (rendering the bottom 14 rows unusable), long stairways, and lack of adequate restroom facilities. The track around the stadium had previously created a large distance between the field and the spectators.

The capacity of the new stadium was set to be approximately 50,000 seats, which were made by Ducharme Seating. The reduction in capacity was a strategic decision by Stanford&#x27;s Athletics Program to boost season ticket sales and create a more intimate playing atmosphere without sacrificing the ability to host large world-class events, such as the FIFA World Cup, in the future. This was partially the result of San Francisco&#x27;s failure to secure a bid for the 2012 Olympics, which would have featured a renovated Stanford Stadium as the main Olympic Venue.

Construction began minutes after the Cardinal&#x27;s last home game of the 2005 football season, a 38–31 loss to Notre Dame on November 26. Bulldozers began tearing out the natural field turf in a ceremony held while attendees were still in the stadium for the game. Construction proceeded quickly through the winter and spring with the goal of opening in time for Stanford&#x27;s game against San Jose State on September 9, 2006, but the game had to be relocated to San Jose State&#x27;s Spartan Stadium due to an unusually wet winter and resulting construction delays. In the summer of 2006, a construction worker fell to his death.

The stadium opened on September 16, 2006 with Stanford losing to Navy 37–9. The Stanford Band was not present at the stadium opening since they were not permitted to play at any athletic events in the month of September due to accusations of vandalism to a temporary trailer which formerly served as their rehearsal facility. Instead, the Navy band performed at halftime and played throughout the game.

The facility now has a rectangular shape, occupies with a footprint of , and has a playing surface below ground level. The stadium has 43 rows on the sides, 22 rows on the ends, and 30 rows below the skybox. The skybox also has 437 spectator seats, more than double the number of the previous press box.

In 2013, Stanford upgraded their scoreboards with twin HD video boards. Also, a ribbon board was added, which displays out-of-town scores and real-time statistics.

<doc id="1239315" wikidata="Q2297042" url="?curid=1239315" title="Tooth &amp; Nail Records">
<text>Tooth &amp; Nail Records is a record label founded by Brandon Ebel in California in November 1993. The label later moved to Seattle where it is today. Tooth &amp; Nail has an imprint Solid State Records. BEC (Brandon Ebel Company) Recordings is Christian rock record label that is an imprint of Tooth &amp; Nail Records. The label was formed in 1997 in partnership with EMI Christian Music Group.

==History==
Brandon Ebel and Michael Knott conceived the label as a joint venture, before Knott backed out. Prior to forming Tooth &amp; Nail, Ebel worked for Frontline Records.

Tooth &amp; Nail&#x27;s first album released was Wish for Eden&#x27;s &quot;Pet the Fish.&quot; In 2002, the label bought out Takehold Records. In 2013, Brandon Ebel sold the entire back catalog of the label and all of its imprints to Capitol Christian Music Group.

==Overview==
Eight Tooth &amp; Nail-affiliated albums have been RIAA-certified as gold for sales of 500,000 or more copies. The label had one of its greatest successes when Underoath&#x27;s &quot;Define the Great Line&quot; debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2006.

NPR described the label as having &quot;altered the course of the Christian rock industry by launching and legitimizing the careers of MxPx, The O.C. Supertones and Underoath.&quot;

==RIAA gold certifications==
==Nominations and awards==

==Structure==
Tooth &amp; Nail contains multiple imprints, each catering to a different genre of music:

* Solid State Records distributes metal and hardcore albums
* Plastiq Musiq (founded by Ronnie Martin of Joy Electric) primarily signed electronic music artists.

On March 13, 2013, it was announced that Brandon Ebel had sold the entire Tooth &amp; Nail music catalog to Capitol Christian Music Group (formerly EMI Christian Music Group) and by doing so was able to buy back the 50% stake in Tooth &amp; Nail formerly owned by EMI making it an independent record label. It will retain the rights to all future releases with a new distributor, RED Distribution.

<text>HMS &quot;Flint Castle&quot; (K383) was one of 44 s built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Completed at the end of 1943, the ship ran aground while training in January 1944. After repairs were completed the following month, she was briefly assigned to the 39th Escort Group for convoy escort duties in the Atlantic Ocean. &quot;Flint Castle&quot; was transferred to Escort Group B2 in March and screened convoys to and from Gibraltar until September. That month, she joined Escort Group B3 to escort convoys between Canada and Britain and continued to do so until the end of the war in May 1945. The ship then became an anti-submarine training ship in Rosyth and Campbeltown, Scotland, before moving to Portland at the beginning of 1947. &quot;Flint Castle&quot; remained there until she was taken out of service in March 1956 and broken up beginning in July 1958.

==Design and description==
The Castle-class corvette was a stretched version of the preceding , enlarged to improve seakeeping and to accommodate modern weapons. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The Castles carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 99 officers and ratings.

The Castle-class ships were equipped with a single QF Mk XVI gun forward, but their primary weapon was their single three-barrel Squid anti-submarine mortar. This was backed up by one depth charge rail and two throwers for 15 depth charges. The ships were fitted with two twin and a pair of single mounts for Oerlikon light AA guns. Provision was made for a further four single mounts if needed. They were equipped with Type 145Q and Type 147B ASDIC sets to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water. A Type 272 search radar and a HF/DF radio direction finder rounded out the Castles&#x27; sensor suite.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Flint Castle&quot;, the only ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy, was ordered on 19 January 1943 and laid down by Henry Robb at their shipyard in Leith, Scotland on 20 April. The ship was launched on 1 September and completed on 31 December. She was damaged by an accidental explosion alongside Barrage Vessel BV 42 on 22 December 1943 and one man killed on each vessel. BV 42 sank.

She arrived at Tobermory, Mull, Scotland, on 12 January 1944 to begin training at the Royal Navy&#x27;s Anti-Submarine Training School, . &quot;Flint Castle&quot; ran aground while training on 18 January and was refloated. She arrived at Belfast, Northern Ireland, the following day to begin repairs that lasted until 9 February. The ship was then assigned to the 39th Escort Group and escorted one Atlantic convoy in mid-March before being transferred to the Liverpool-based Escort Group B2 to escort convoys to and from Gibraltar. In September 1944, &quot;Flint Castle&quot; was assigned to Escort Group B3, which protected convoys sailing between St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, and Britain. The ship was refitted in Cardiff, Wales, in January–March 1945 and rejoined her group in Liverpool in April.

She was assigned to Rosyth Command in June as an anti-submarine training ship and visited ports in Norway and Germany over the next several months. &quot;Flint Castle&quot; was transferred to the Rosyth Escort Force in June 1946, which was employed as a training unit; it was redesignated as the Basic Anti-Submarine Training Flotilla in September. The unit was then transferred to Portland and used a variety of names before settling on the Second Training Squadron in January 1952. On 15 June 1953, she took part in the Fleet Review held at Spithead to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The ship was used to portray a German anti-submarine vessel in the 1955 film &quot;The Cockleshell Heroes&quot;.

&quot;Flint Castle&quot; was taken out of service in March 1956 at Devonport Dockyard, until her demolition began, starting on 10 July 1958 at Faslane. While her service was uneventful, &quot;Flint Castle&quot; was awarded the battle honour of Atlantic 1944–45.

<text>Heather Mary Harper (8 May 1930 – 22 April 2019) was a Northern Irish operatic soprano. She was active internationally in both opera and concert. She performed roles such as Helena in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the Royal Opera House, Elsa in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; at the Bayreuth Festival, and the Countess in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera. She became known internationally when she stepped in for the world premiere of Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; in 1962, and remained associated with the composer&#x27;s work, but also sang other premieres.

== Early life and education ==
Heather Harper was born on 8 May 1930 in Belfast, the daughter of Mary (née Robb) and Hugh Harper, a lawyer. She and her three siblings received early musical training. She studied piano at the Trinity College of Music in London on a scholarship, with viola and cello as additional subjects. When the opportunity to study voice came up, she won another scholarship. 

She initially sang as a mezzo-soprano. She was a member of the Ambrosian Chorus, where her fellow altos included Jean Allister, Pamela Bowden and Helen Watts, the BBC Chorus and the George Mitchell Singers. Her voice at this time was characterised by its &quot;bright, flexible coloratura&quot;, more typical of a soprano. She studied with Helene Isepp, and retrained as a soprano with Frederick Husler and Yvonne Rodd-Marling, the authors of &quot;Singing: The Physical Nature of the Vocal Organ&quot;.

==Career==
Her professional debut came in 1954, singing Lady Macbeth in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; at the Oxford University Opera Club, produced by Jack Westrup. Her performance was a critical success, and she was subsequently given the role of Violetta in a 1956 television production of &quot;La traviata&quot;. She was a member of the English Opera Group from 1956 to 1975. Her first role at the Royal Opera House (ROH) Covent Garden was Helena in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 1962. Later roles there included the title role in &quot;Arabella&quot; by Richard Strauss, Blanche in Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Les dialogues des Carmélites&quot;, Antonia in Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;, Gutrune in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, Micaëla in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, Eva in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, Hecuba in &quot;King Priam&quot;, Chrysothemis in &quot;Elektra&quot;, the Empress in &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; and the title role in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;. She appeared at the ROH in 1975 as Ellen Orford in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; in a new production staged by Elijah Moshinsky, alongside Jon Vickers in the title role. She also created Nadia in Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Ice Break&quot; and Mrs Coyle in the stage premiere of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; at the ROH; she had previously sung in the television premiere of &quot;Owen Wingrave&quot; in 1970: a &quot;high point&quot; in her many performances for television, according to her obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Her farewell performance at the ROH was Ellen in &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; in 1981. A critic noted in an obituary: &quot;Her sympathy for the character drew a near-definitive portrayal.&quot;

At the Bayreuth Festival, Harper appeared as Elsa in &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in 1967 and 1968, conducted by Rudolf Kempe. She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Contessa Almaviva in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; in 1977. She also sang Charlotte in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot; for the San Francisco Opera. She appeared as a regular guest at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, including roles such as Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Vitellia in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;. In 1982, the soprano debuted with the New York City Opera in the name part of Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot;.

Harper also had an extensive concert career. She sang in the premiere of Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; at Coventry Cathedral with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Peter Pears in 1962, substituting for Galina Vishnevskaya at ten days&#x27; notice. In 1965, she was the soprano soloist in the second UK performance of Delius&#x27;s Requiem in Liverpool, conducted by Charles Groves. She sang in it again in 1968 in London, conducted by Meredith Davies, and appeared in the first recording with the same participants. In 1975, she was the soprano soloist in Verdi&#x27;s Requiem at London&#x27;s Kingsway Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Carlos Païta. At the Belfast Last Night of the Proms in 1985, she gave the world premiere of Malcolm Williamson&#x27;s song cycle &quot;Next Year in Jerusalem&quot; to international critical acclaim. She sang the soprano solo in the world premiere of Tippett&#x27;s Third Symphony in 1972. 

She retired from her singing career in 1994. Her final performance was at the BBC Proms, singing Alban Berg&#x27;s &quot;Altenberg Lieder&quot; and Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Serenade to Music&quot;.

==Recordings==
Her recordings include &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; in both audio and video formats. In 1957, she took part in first recordings, conducted by Antony Hopkins, of sacred works by Michel Richard Delalande for the L&#x27;Oiseau-Lyre label. Some 1970s recordings, conducted by Sir Georg Solti, were reissued, notably Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony with Lucia Popp, Arleen Augér, Yvonne Minton, Helen Watts, René Kollo, John Shirley-Quirk and Martti Talvela; and &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot; by Richard Strauss with Helga Dernesch, Ruth Hesse, James King and Walter Berry (Covent Garden, 1976, Fiori). Two of her recordings won the Grammy Award, &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; in 1979 and &quot;Songs Of Maurice Ravel&quot; in 1984. In 1964, the soprano sang in the first recording of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Von heute auf morgen&quot; (released in 1971), conducted by Robert Craft.

She recorded Britten&#x27;s War Requiem in 1991 in an award-winning CD conducted by Richard Hickox. Alan Blyth wrote, comparing the recording to earlier ones: In 2005, a live concert performance of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Our Hunting Fathers&quot; was issued on the London Philharmonic Orchestra&#x27;s own label.

==Personal life==
Harper married twice. Her first marriage to Leonard Buck ended in divorce in 1972. She married Argentinian scientist Eduardo E. Benarroch in 1973. 

Harper&#x27;s sister was a cellist in the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and her brother was a hornist with the ROH, the Royal Philharmonic and the English Chamber Orchestra.

Heather Harper received the CBE in 1965. She died on 22 April 2019, aged 88.

<text>Myron Bradford Kreidler (born September 28, 1943) is an American physician and politician who previously served as the eighth Washington Insurance Commissioner. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served one term in the Congress, representing Washington&#x27;s 9th congressional district.

==Education and early career==
Kreidler holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a doctor of optometry from Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon. After his US Army service as an optometry officer, he earned a master of public health degree in health administration from the UCLA School of Public Health.

He was employed as an optometrist by Group Health Cooperative of the Puget Sound in the Olympia clinic for twenty years. In 1973, he won a seat on the North Thurston School Board. He also served in the Washington State Legislature for 16 years.

==Political career==
Kreidler served 16 years in the Washington Legislature. He was in the Washington House of Representatives from 1976 to 1984 and then the Washington State Senate from 1984 to 1992. He was elected to the United States Congress as a Representative from the of Washington in 1992. He was defeated by Republican Randy Tate in 1994.

Following his re-election defeat to Congress in 1994, he was appointed to the Northwest Power Planning Council in 1995 by Washington Governor Mike Lowry and subsequently re-appointed by Governor Gary Locke. He served on the NWPPC until 1998 when he was appointed Regional Director for the United States Department of Health and Human Services&#x27;s Region 10 office in Seattle, Washington, serving in that post until 2000, when he resigned in order to seek election to the office of Washington State Insurance Commissioner.

Kreidler is Washington&#x27;s eighth insurance commissioner. He was first elected as insurance commissioner in 2000. He was re-elected to a sixth term in 2020.
He retired as a lieutenant colonel from the Army Reserves with 20 years of service.

=== Health care ===
Kreidler has focused on health reform most of his career and worked to implement the Affordable Care Act in Washington state. He was the first insurance commissioner to reject President Obama&#x27;s proposal to give insurers another year to sell pre-Affordable Care Act plans and testified before Congress on the law&#x27;s impact on Washington state.

He has opposed efforts by the Trump administration to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, including coverage for pre-existing conditions and limiting the sale of short-term medical plans.

====Surprise billing====
In 2019, Kreidler proposed legislation banning the practice of surprise medical billing. After several extreme cases were highlighted in the news, support for his proposal increased and the bill was signed into law later that year.

====Health care sharing ministries====
Kreidler has taken action against fake health sharing ministries and in 2019, he fined one company and its affiliate more than $1 million for selling sham health sharing ministry memberships in Washington state to thousands of consumers.

===Climate change===
Since 2007, Kreidler has chaired the National Association of Insurance Commissioners&#x27; Climate Change and Global Warming Work Group. He led a successful push for insurers to disclose if and how they are preparing for the potential risks associated with climate change.

== Controversies ==
* The &quot;Seattle Times&quot; editorialized that Kreidler was &quot;slow to stand up for the tens of thousands of families struggling to get necessary care for loved ones with mental illness. Astoundingly, his office has not taken a single enforcement action on the law, and a proposed rule to strengthen enforcement has languished in his office for two years.&quot; It took class-action attorneys to win a judgment at the Washington Supreme Court for those with autism being denied care by insurers, with no help from Kreidler.
* Taxpayers paid a $450,000 settlement to whistleblower after State Auditor Troy Kelley refused to investigate her complaint against a Kreidler chief deputy—there was no discipline for the chief deputy.
* Taxpayers paid $50,000 settlement, following a $20,000 investigation, after a Kreidler chief deputy allegedly harassed a worker who was forced to borrow sick leave from co-workers while the chief deputy enjoyed two months of paid leave before finally being dismissed.
* Kreidler had a chief deputy quit following a 2013 hallway argument over a plant Kreidler wanted to accept as a gift from a special interest. Most executive staff followed.
* In June 2017, Washington&#x27;s health insurers announced that they were increasing rates for 2018 by an average of over 22 percent. Kreidler had, just days before his 2016 re-election, dismissed 2017 increases averaging 13.6% as &quot;a one-time adjustment.&quot; A July 2017 &quot;Seattle Times&quot; article described Kreidler as &quot;sympathetic to insurers&quot; despite their huge surpluses.

==Misconduct allegations==

In April 2022, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; reported that several former employees or interviewed candidates for positions in the Office of the Insurance Commissioner had described racist or derogatory terms used by Kreidler from 2017 to 2022. The report also alleged that he had asked for &quot;unusual favors&quot; from non-white employees and that Kreidler had been &quot;demeaning or rude&quot; in interactions. Governor Jay Inslee and the majority and minority leaders of both legislative chambers asked Kriedler to resign due to the allegations, his admittance of fault, and the firing of an aide who had been critical of Kriedler&#x27;s behavior. Kriedler stated in June 2022 that he would not resign; on May 1, 2023, he announced that he would not run for a seventh term in the 2024 elections.

==Personal life==
Kreidler resides in Lacey, Washington with his wife, Lela. They have three grown children and three grandchildren. He is a member of several professional and fraternal organizations. He retired from the United States Army Reserve as a Lieutenant Colonel, after serving on active duty as an optometrist during the Vietnam and first Persian Gulf wars.

<doc id="1239321" wikidata="Q1054761" url="?curid=1239321" title="HERA (particle accelerator)">
<text>HERA (, ) was a particle accelerator at DESY in Hamburg. It was operated from 1992 to 30 June 2007. At HERA, electrons or positrons were brought to collision with protons at a center-of-mass energy of 320 GeV. 
HERA was used mainly to study the structure of protons and the properties of quarks, laying the foundation for much of the science done at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN particle physics laboratory today. HERA is the only lepton–proton collider in the world to date and was on the energy frontier in certain regions of the kinematic range. 


To collide protons with either electrons or positrons, HERA used mainly superconducting magnets, which was also a world first. At HERA, it was possible to study the structure of protons up to 30 times more accurately than before. The resolution covered structures 1/1000 of the proton in size, facilitating many discoveries concerning the composition of protons from quarks and gluons.

The HERA tunnel runs 10 to 25 m below ground level and has a circumference of 6.3 km and an inner diameter of 5.2 m. For the construction, the same technology was used as for the construction of subway tunnels. Two storage rings were located on top of each other inside the tube. One accelerated electrons to energies of 27.5 GeV, the other one protons to energies of 920 GeV in the opposite direction. Both beams completed their circle nearly at the speed of light, making approximately revolutions per second.

There are four interaction regions around the ring, which were used by the experiments H1, ZEUS, HERMES and HERA-B. All these experiments were particle detectors run by international groups of researchers. These groups developed, constructed and ran the multi-storey, complex measurement devices in many years of cooperative work and evaluated enormous amounts of data.

== HERA accelerators ==
Leptons (electrons or positrons) were pre-accelerated to 450 MeV in the linear accelerator LINAC II. From there, they were injected into the storage ring DESY II and accelerated further to 7.5 GeV before their transfer into the storage ring PETRA, where they were accelerated to 14 GeV. Finally, they were injected into their storage ring in the HERA tunnel and reached a final energy of 27.5 GeV. This storage ring was equipped with warm (non-superconducting) magnets keeping the leptons on their circular track by a magnetic field of 0.17 tesla.

Protons were obtained from originally negatively charged hydrogen ions and pre-accelerated to 50 MeV in a linear accelerator. They were then injected into the proton synchrotron DESY III and accelerated further to 7 GeV. Then they were transferred to PETRA, where they were accelerated to 40 GeV. Finally, they were injected into their storage ring in the HERA tunnel and reached their final energy of 920 GeV. The proton storage ring used superconducting magnets to keep the protons on track.

The lepton beam in HERA became naturally transversely polarised through the Sokolov–Ternov effect. The characteristic build-up time expected for the HERA accelerator was approximately 40 minutes. Spin rotators on either side of the experiments changed the transverse polarisation of the beam into longitudinal polarisation. The positron beam polarisation was measured using two independent polarimeters, the transverse polarimeter (TPOL) and the longitudinal polarimeter (LPOL). Both devices exploit the spin-dependent cross section for Compton scattering of circularly polarised photons off positrons to measure the beam polarisation. The transverse polarimeter was upgraded in 2001 to provide a fast measurement for every positron bunch, and position-sensitive silicon strip and scintillating-fibre detectors were added to investigate systematic effects.

On 30 June 2007 at 11:23 pm, HERA was shut down, and dismantling of the four experiments started. HERA&#x27;s main pre-accelerator PETRA was converted into a synchrotron radiation source, operated under the name PETRA III since 2009. Today, a section of the HERA tunnel and 24 former superconducting dipole magnets are being used for the new ALPS experiment, which looks for axion-like particles.

== International project HERA ==
The construction of HERA was one of the first truly internationally financed projects of this magnitude. Previously, the construction of scientific facilities was always financed by the country in which they were located. Only the costs for the experiments were borne by the conducting national or foreign institutes. Due to the enormous scope of the HERA project, many international institutions agreed to participate already in the construction.

More than 45 institutes and 320 corporations participated in the construction of the facility with donations of money or materials, and more than 20% of the costs were borne by foreign institutions.

Following the example of HERA, many large-scale scientific projects have since then been financed jointly by several countries. This model has become established and international cooperation is moderately common in the construction of those facilities.

== HERA experiments ==

=== H1 ===

H1 was a universal detector for the collision of electrons and protons, located in the HERA Hall North. It measured 12 m × 10 m × 15 m, weighed 2800 tons and was operated from 1992 to 2007. It was designed for probing the inner structure of the proton, the exploration of the strong interaction as well as the search for new kinds of matter and unexpected phenomena in particle physics.

==== ZEUS ====

Like H1, ZEUS was a detector for electron–proton collisions, located in the HERA Hall South. It measured 12 m × 11 m × 20 m, weighed 3600 tons and was operated from 1992 to 2007. Its tasks were similar to those of H1.

==== HERA-B ====

HERA-B was an experiment in the HERA Hall West, which collected data from 1999 to February 2003. By using HERA&#x27;s proton beam, researchers at HERA-B conducted experiments on heavy quarks. The detector measured 8 m × 20 m × 9 m and weighed 1000 tons.

==== HERMES ====

The HERMES experiment in the HERA Hall East was operated from 1995 to 2007. HERA&#x27;s longitudinally polarised electron beam was used to explore the spin structure of nucleons. For this purpose, the electrons were scattered at energies of 27.5 GeV at an internal gas target. This target and the detector itself were designed especially with a view to spin-polarised physics. The detector measured 3.5 m × 8 m × 5 m and weighed 400 tons.

<doc id="1239324" wikidata="Q2194268" url="?curid=1239324" title="Redbreast sunfish">
<text>The redbreast sunfish (Lepomis auritus) is a species of freshwater fish in the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) of the order Centrarchiformes. The type species of its genus, it is native to the river systems of eastern Canada and the United States. The redbreast sunfish reaches a maximum recorded length of about .

The species prefers vegetated and rocky pools and lake margins for its habitat. Its diet can include insects, snails, and other small invertebrates. A panfish popular with anglers, the redbreast sunfish is also kept as an aquarium fish by hobbyists. Redbreast sunfish are usually caught with live bait such as nightcrawlers, crickets, grasshoppers, waxworms, or mealworms. They can also be caught using small lures or flies. Most anglers use light spinning tackle to catch redbreast sunfish. It is popular with fly anglers in the winter because it will more readily strike a moving fly than will bluegills in cooler water.

As is typical for the sunfishes, the female redbreast sunfish lays her eggs (about 1000) in a substrate depression built by the male. The male guards the eggs and fry.

The specific epithet, &quot;auritus,&quot; is Latin for big-eared.

==Description==

The average length of the redbreast sunfish is around with a record . The record weight for the fish is . The redbreast sunfish is characterized by a long black opercular flap, which is longer than those of most other sunfish in its range. There are a few blue iridescent vermiculations on the head. Small teeth may be appreciated, mostly on the roof of the mouth. There are faint vertical bars present on the olive-green bodies of both sexes, which may become more apparent as the background coloration changes to blue-green near the lateral line. Males have darker ventral coloration than that of females, ranging from orange-yellow to orange-red. The caudal fin has a shallow fork and may have orange to red pigmentation. It is common within the redbreast sunfish&#x27;s native and introduced range for hybridization with other sunfish species to occur.

==Distribution==
The species&#x27; native range is in the eastern United States and Canada, in rivers emptying into the Atlantic Ocean. The redbreast sunfish tends to be more of a cool-river species, but also inhabits freshwater lakes and streams. The species has been introduced as far west as Louisiana and West Texas.
&quot;Lepomis auritus&quot; has been transplanted to and become established in Germany, Italy, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The effects of introduced populations of redbreast sunfish on native species are not well studied.

==Ecology==

Redbreast sunfish mainly consume immature aquatic insects. Mayflies, small fish, and dragonfly larvae consist of the majority of the sunfish&#x27;s diet based on stomach content. Small crayfish may also be consumed. Being an opportunistic feeder, the fish competes with other sunfish and larger predatory fish that prey on the same food they do.

Larger piscivorous fish are the main predators of smaller redbreast sunfish. &quot;Micropterus&quot; species are a major threat to sunfish because of their shared habitat and the availability of the sunfish. The sunfish prefers structures around banks and overhanging branches that provide food, shade, and protection. &quot;Lepomis auritus&quot; survives best in water with a current and a pH between 7.0 and 7.5. Lack of current, overly acidic, or basic water can dramatically affect the sunfish&#x27;s survival rate.

Human influence on abiotic factors, such as sunlight, and biotic factors, such as predator numbers, can have a major influence on sunfish. Clearing debris from the bank can increase the amount of sunlight that reaches the water, thus increasing water temperature, while also decreasing the number of hiding places along the bank that sunfish can use. Decreasing the number of larger predatory fish by harvesting them will increase the survival rate of the redbreast sunfish.

==Life history==
The redbreast sunfish is a spring spawner on sand-gravel substrate, depending on location or when water temperature reaches . Males build a nest in shallow water. The female deposits her eggs in the nest, and the male guards the nest after fertilizing the eggs. Cuckoldry, in which a non-nesting male fertilizes eggs left in a nest, has also been observed. Average egg production for the sunfish is around 3000, depending on the age of the female. Mature ova are around in diameter. Reproductive maturity is reached in the second year of life. They have been known to have a maximum lifespan of around eight years. Currently, humans do not play a large role in influencing life history due to large populations and secluded areas.

== Relationship with humans ==
=== Management ===
Currently, the redbreast sunfish is not on the federal or state endangered or threatened species list. The species is thriving in its natural habitat.

=== Angling ===
The IGFA all tackle world record for the species stands at caught from the Suwannee River in Florida in 1984. A Georgia state record fish caught in the Satilla River in May 2022 tied the world record. A North Carolina state record fish caught on the Lumber River in 2019 weighed .

<doc id="1239342" wikidata="Q3502845" url="?curid=1239342" title="Tablet (confectionery)">
<text>Tablet ( in Scots) is a medium-hard, sugary confection from Scotland. Tablet is usually made from sugar, condensed milk, and butter, which is boiled to a soft-ball stage and allowed to crystallise. It is often flavoured with vanilla and sometimes has nut pieces in it.

Tablet differs from fudge in that it has a brittle, grainy texture, where fudge is much softer. Well-made tablet is a medium-hard confection, not as soft as fudge, but not as hard as boiled sweets.

Commercially available tablet often uses fondant instead of the milk products. This produces a slightly less granular texture compared to the traditional home-made tablet, and is supposedly easier to prepare on a commercial scale.

==History==
According to &quot;The Scots Kitchen&quot; by F. Marian McNeill, tablet is noted in &quot;The Household Book of Lady Grisell Baillie&quot; in the early 18th century. The traditional recipe uses just sugar and cream. More modern recipes substitute condensed milk and butter for the cream, as cream has a tendency to burn when boiled.

==Names==
Tablet is sometimes referred to as &quot;Swiss Milk tablet&quot; (Swiss Milk being a term used by some for condensed milk) or &quot;butter tablet&quot;.

<text>Phyllis Curtin (née Smith; December 3, 1921 – June 5, 2016) was an American soprano and academic teacher who had an active career in operas and concerts from the early 1950s through the 1980s. She is known for her creation of roles in operas by Carlisle Floyd, such as the title role in &quot;Susannah&quot; and Catherine Earnshaw in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. She was a dedicated song recitalist, who retired from singing in 1984. She was named Boston University&#x27;s Dean Emerita, College of Fine Arts in 1991.

== Education and early career ==
Phyllis Smith was born in Clarksburg, West Virginia, and studied singing with Olga Averino at Wellesley College where she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Political Science. She pursued graduate studies in vocal performance under Boris Goldovsky at the New England Conservatory. In 1946 she made her professional opera debut with Goldovsky&#x27;s opera company, the New England Opera Theater, as Tatyana in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. She took the surname Curtin from her first husband, whom she divorced after nine years.

She performed several other roles with the company over the next seven years, including Countess Almaviva in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1947). In 1950, Curtin performed in the inaugural year of the Peabody Mason Concerts in Boston. In 1953 she joined the roster of principal sopranos at the New York City Opera (NYCO) at the invitation of Joseph Rosenstock. She made her debut with the company on October 22, 1953, portraying three roles (Fräulein Bürstner, Frau Grubach, and Leni) in the U.S. premiere of Einem&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot;.

She remained committed to the NYCO through 1960, where her roles included Alice Ford in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;, Antonia in Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, Countess Almaviva, Cressida in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, Fiordiligi in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, Frau Fluth in Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, Katharina in Vittorio Giannini&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Konstanze in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, Mélisande in Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, Norina in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;, Rosalinde in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; by Johann Strauss, and the title roles in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; and in &quot;Salome&quot; by Richard Strauss. She sang two roles in operas by Carlisle Floyd with the NYCO that she had previously created in their world premieres: the title role in &quot;Susannah&quot; (which she sang at Florida State University for its 1955 world premiere) and Catherine Earnshaw in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (which she sang at the Santa Fe Opera for its 1958 premiere).

She appeared as Thérèse in the American premiere of Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Les mamelles de Tirésias&quot; at Brandeis University in 1953. She returned to Brandeis two years later to portray the title role in Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;Médée&quot;.

In 1956 she toured the U.S. with the NBC Opera Company as Countess Almaviva with Walter Cassel as the Count, Adelaide Bishop as Sussana, and Frances Bible as Cherubino. In 1957 she appeared as Elena in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Paride ed Elena&quot; with the American Opera Society. In 1958 she portrayed Floyd&#x27;s Susannah at the Brussels World&#x27;s Fair. In the 1959–1960 season she sang two roles with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company: Rosalinde and Susannah. In 1959 she made her debut at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. She also made appearances at the Aspen Music Festival, the Cincinnati Opera, the Tanglewood Music Festival, and appeared in concerts with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and The Little Orchestra Society during the 1950s.

== Later career ==
After the close of the 1959–60 season, Curtin left the employ of the NYCO, although she would continue to perform as a guest artist with the company up through 1964; she returned for performances in 1975 and 1976. She sang Fiordiligi for the NBC Television Opera Theatre in 1960. She sang several roles at the Vienna State Opera from 1960–61, including the title role of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;, Fiordiligi, Salome, and Traviata. In 1961 she made her debuts at the Oper Frankfurt, the Staatsoper Stuttgart, and the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi. She made her first appearance at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1965 and her debut at the Seattle Opera in 1969. In the same year she appeared as Donna Anna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the Glyndebourne Festival.

Curtin appeared at the La Scala in Milan in 1962, in &quot;Cosí fan tutte&quot; opposite Teresa Berganza. In 1966 she appeared in the world premiere of Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;La mère coupable&quot; at the Grand Théâtre de Genève. In 1968 she appeared as Mimì in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La Bohème&quot; at the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company with Richard Tucker as Rodolfo and Ron Bottcher as Marcello. Other guest appearances included performances at the Scottish Opera (as Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Ellen Orford in Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;) at La Scala.

Curtin made her Metropolitan Opera (Met) debut on November 4, 1961, as Fiordiligi to the Ferrando of George Shirley, Dorabella of Rosalind Elias, Guglielmo of Theodor Uppman, Despina of Roberta Peters, and Don Alfonso of Frank Guarrera. She returned frequently as a guest artist at the Met, appearing in such roles as Alice Ford, Countess Almaviva, Donna Anna, Ellen Orford, Eva in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, Rosalinde, Salome, and Violetta. Her last Met appearance was on July 6, 1973, in the title role of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; with Enrico Di Giuseppe as Cavaradossi and Ignace Strasfogel conducting.

==Teaching==
Curtin was a professor of voice at the School of Music at Yale University from 1974-1983. She was Artistic Advisor at the Opera Institute at the Boston University College of Fine Arts School of Music, where she held a Deanship of the Schools for the Arts, as well as Artist-in-Residence at the Tanglewood Music Center where she taught voice for more than fifty years. 

From 1979–83 she was the master of Yale&#x27;s Branford College, making her that college&#x27;s first female master, despite Branford fellows asking Yale to choose a &quot;real master&quot; instead. Curtin was dean of Boston University’s College of Fine Arts from 1983 to 1991, and founded its Opera Institute in 1987. As professor Emerita at Boston University&#x27;s Opera Institute, Curtin taught a series of masterclasses at the school each semester.

==Personal life==
She married Philip Curtin, a history professor, in 1946. In April 1954 &quot;Life Magazine&quot; devoted three pages to pictures of her, describing her &quot;long-limbed, lush-voiced and intense&quot; account of the Dance of the Seven Veils in Strauss&#x27;s Salome. Soon afterwards her marriage was dissolved. In 1956 she married Gene Cook, a photographer with &quot;Life Magazine&quot;. He died in 1986. The couple had one child, Claudia Madeleine, born 1961.

Curtin died at her home in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, on June 5, 2016, aged 94, having suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and circulatory ailments.

==Video and audio recordings==
In 1995, VAI released, on compact discs, the 1962 performance of &quot;Susannah&quot;, from New Orleans, which co-starred Norman Treigle and Richard Cassilly. VAI and other record companies have released other CDs featuring Curtin. In 1988, Kultur published a video cassette recording of the 1968 &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot; program, &quot;Opera: Two to Six&quot;.

She can be seen in staged excerpts from &quot;Faust&quot; and &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. VAI later released several &quot;Bell Telephone Hour&quot; DVDs featuring Curtin. In 2007 VAI released a DVD featuring Curtin in the soprano role (i.e., the Latin text) in Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot;. This 1963 performance by the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erich Leinsdorf at Tanglewood was the work&#x27;s American premiere.

==Tributes==

<text>Correlli Douglas Barnett (28 June 1927 – 10 July 2022) was an English military historian, who also wrote works of economic history, particularly on the United Kingdom&#x27;s post-war deindustrialization.

==Early life==
Barnett was born on 28 June 1927 in Norbury, County Borough of Croydon, the son of Douglas and Kathleen Barnett. He was educated at Trinity School of John Whitgift in Croydon and then Exeter College, Oxford where he gained a second class honours degree in Modern History with his special subject being Military History and the Theory of War, gaining an MA in 1954.

Barnett later said: 

From 1945 to 1948, he served in the British Army in Palestine during the Palestine Emergency as a sergeant in the Intelligence Corps.

==Work==
===Military history===
Barnett worked as historical consultant and writer for the BBC television series &quot;The Great War&quot; (1963–64). He contributed numerous articles to various newspapers arguing against the 2003 Iraq War.

He was the author of &quot;The Desert Generals&quot;, a book that attacked the perceived cult of British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and assessed the roles of his sacked predecessors as commanders in the North Africa campaign, including Richard O&#x27;Connor, who drove the Italians from Cyrenaica in late 1940, and Field-Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck (whom he called &quot;The Victor of Alamein&quot;), who forced Rommel to a halt at the First Battle of El Alamein, only to be dismissed by Winston Churchill for his pains. He pointed out that Montgomery enjoyed massive superiority of men and materiel at the Second Battle of El Alamein, and described him as an &quot;emotional cripple&quot;, a description, he noted in subsequent editions, borne out &quot;in rich detail&quot; by the Nigel Hamilton biography. However, Barnett&#x27;s conclusions were attacked by Field Marshal Michael Carver in his book &quot;Dilemmas of the Desert War&quot;; Carver calls Barnett &quot;naïve&quot; and notes numerous flaws in his work.

He also published &quot;Britain and Her Army 1509–1970&quot;, which as a survey combines the political, the social and the military over the grand sweep of Britain&#x27;s post-medieval history.

In several of his works (&quot;The Desert Generals&quot;, &quot;The Swordbearers&quot;) Barnett portrayed the British armed forces as hidebound by tradition (e.g. cavalry regiments allegedly reluctant to adopt modern tank tactics) and by technology inferior to that of the Germans. This position was also attacked by Carver, who observed that during Operation Crusader and during the Battle of Gazala, British technology was a match for, or in some cases, better than that used by the German and Italian armies. Barnett made this point of the British armour in the desert, and of Jellicoe&#x27;s Grand Fleet at Jutland in 1916.

In his &quot;Bonaparte&quot; (1978), he took a more critical view of Napoleon Bonaparte than is customary, portraying him almost as a Mediterranean bandit keen to dish out crowns and honours to cronies and members of his blood family, and stressing how much many of his most famous successes owed much to bluff and luck (e.g. the fortuitous arrival of General Louis Desaix at the Battle of Marengo).

===The Pride and Fall Sequence===
Barnett&#x27;s &quot;The Pride and Fall&quot; sequence comprises: (1) &quot;The Collapse of British Power&quot;; (2) &quot;The Audit of War: The Illusion and Reality of Britain as a Great Nation&quot; (published as &quot;The Pride and the Fall: The Dream and Illusion of Britain as a Great Nation&quot;, in the USA); (3) &quot;The Lost Victory: British Dreams, British Realities, 1945-50&quot;; and (4) &quot;The Verdict of Peace: Britain Between Her Yesterday and the Future&quot;.

In sum, the sequence describes the decline of British power during the twentieth century, a decline attributed by the author to a change in the values of Britain&#x27;s governing élite from the late eighteenth century, and one which was encouraged by evangelical and non-conformist Christianity. Barnett claims that the statesmen of the eighteenth century were men &quot;hard of mind and hard of will&quot; who regarded &quot;national power as the essential foundation of national independence; commercial wealth as a means to power; and war as among the means to all three&quot;. Furthermore, they regarded it as &quot;natural and inevitable that nations should be engaged in a ceaseless struggle for survival, prosperity and predominance&quot;. The British national character, Barnett argues, underwent a profound moral revolution in the nineteenth century which came to have a deep effect on British foreign policy; foreign policy was now to be conducted in a reverence of highly ethical standards rather than an &quot;expedient and opportunist pursuit of England&#x27;s interests&quot;. Barnett came to this conclusion by beginning &quot;with a colour-coded flow-chart which logically traced back step by step to their origins the chains of causation of all the &#x27;total-strategic&#x27; factors in Britain&#x27;s plight in 1940–1941: political, military, economic, technological. These various chains eventually converged on a common primary cause: a mutation in the values – indeed the very character – of the British governing classes which began in the early nineteenth century. This mutation supplied the starting-point of my narrative, and thereafter, in Enoch Powell&#x27;s words in his review, was my &#x27;guiding and interpretative thread through the events of the twenty inter-war years&#x27;.&quot;

A.J.P. Taylor said of &quot;The Collapse of British Power&quot;: &quot;This is fine fighting stuff, powerfully based on the historical records&quot;. Robert Blake said the book was &quot;Pungently written, perceptive and controversial&quot;. Rab Butler said that 

Peter Hennessy claims &quot;The Audit of War&quot; &quot;acquired an instant vogue when published in 1986&quot;. Paul Addison called &quot;The Audit of War&quot; as &quot;the most thorough and sustained assault so far&quot; on wartime orthodoxy. Addison recognised that Barnett &quot;is a withering critic of nineteenth-century &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism and its legacy for twentieth-century Britain. To this extent he shares some common ground with Marxist historians and quotes E.P. Thompson with approval. But he is no Marxist himself, and his ideal model of the relationship between state and society is Bismarckian. The development of modern Germany, through the creation of a state dedicated to the pursuit of national efficiency in a ruthlessly Darwinian world, is held up by Barnett as the example which Britain could, and should, have followed. Britain&#x27;s tradition of collectivism he interprets as a decadent, &quot;romanticizing humanism, anti-industrial, riddled with illusions, and perpetuated by the public-school system&quot;&quot;. Addison criticised Barnett&#x27;s thesis in &quot;The Audit of War&quot; as resting &quot;on a number of simplifications. First, he divorced the history of Britain from its European context and thereby distorts the perspective. Secondly, he fails to acknowledge the political imperatives behind the reconstruction programme. Thirdly, he neglects the politics of industrial conservatism. Fourthly, his analysis is remarkably selective, singling out one factor – the welfare state – and one government, as uniquely responsible for difficulties that no other government, before or since, has surmounted&quot;.

Roger Scruton claimed that whilst Barnett&#x27;s thesis against public schools was set forth in &quot;a series of brilliant books&quot;, his view of education is mistaken: &quot;Relevance in education is a chimerical objective and the English knew this. Who is to guess what will be relevant to a student&#x27;s interests in ten years&#x27; time? Even in the applied sciences, it is not relevance that forms and transforms the curriculum, but knowledge&quot;. Scruton goes on to say: &quot;And for what life of the mind would Correlli Barnett have us prepared? Certainly not one that offers what has been offered to him: namely a synoptic vision of a national identity. If we examine the complaints made by Barnett, we cannot fail to be struck by the fact that they contain no comparative judgement. Set beside which élite did the English fail so badly? In which country of the modern world do we find the educational system which compares so favourably with the English college? Which European nations, unhampered by the code of the gentleman, have shown us the way to successful empire building and retreated with credit from their colonies? All such comparisons point to the amazing success of the English. By devoting their formative years to useless things, they made themselves supremely useful. And by internalising the code of honour they did not, as Barnett supposes, make themselves defenceless in a world of chicanery and crime, but endowed themselves with the only real defence that human life can offer – the instinctive trust between strangers, which enables them in whatever dangerous circumstances to act together as a team&quot;.

==Politics==

During the February 1974 general election Barnett wrote a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;: 

In 1974, Barnett wrote of Britain&#x27;s economic crisis as a low-wage, low-investment and low-productivity nation:the peculiar structure, history and attitudes of British trades unionism is—and has been for a century—largely, although not wholly, responsible for this dismal cycle. You cannot pay high wages unless you have already achieved high productivity. You cannot achieve high productivity unless the work-force is prepared to operate modern machines to the utmost of the machines&#x27; capacity. Yet for all the glib talk by trades union leaders about improving productivity, everyone knows that British industry is fettered by demarcations and other restrictive practices aimed at preserving somebody&#x27;s &quot;property rights&quot; in a particular task...the necessary switch to a high-wage economy cannot be achieved in isolation, by the process of &quot;free collective bargaining&quot; (ie, extortion of money by menaces or force), but only in step with a parallel switch to high productivity and investment. Are Mr Scanlon&#x27;s members—and other British workers—prepared to match the efficiency, flexibility, cooperativeness and zeal of German workers—or do they really simply want more money for going on as they are?

After the historian&#x27;s E.P. Thompson planned Dimbleby Lecture on the Cold War was cancelled in 1981, Barnett asked whether he (Thompson) sawany connexion between the internal nature of the Soviet empire as an oligarchic tyranny and its external policies? As a former communist he must know that the Soviet regime is of its very nature and from earliest origins a minority conspiracy that has gained and maintained power by force and trickery; that because of this inherent nature it always has been and remains terrified of independent centres of thought or power, whether within the Russian empire or beyond its present reach. It is the conjunction of such a regime, and its manifested wish to dominate others, with armed forces powerful beyond the needs of mere defence that is the engine of the present &quot;armaments race&quot;. Who believes that Nato and its armaments would exist if Russia had been a Western-style open society these last 60 years? The first requirement for large-scale nuclear or any other kind of disarmament is the withering away of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

In 1982, Barnett said of Britain&#x27;s Trident missile system that:The American decision to sell us Trident only makes sense on the supposition that Washington absolutely trusts Britain to be a docile ally which would not step out of line...The question therefore arises of how closely Great Britain wishes to align herself with the United States over the next 40 years; of what unstated &quot;quid pro quos&quot; by way of support for American policy outside Europe may be involved. In a word, is Trident a reassertion of the &quot;special relationship&quot;? If that is the case, how well does such a relationship with the United States marry with the United Kingdom&#x27;s membership of the EEC, and with her European policy in general? Are we not in danger of falling into mid-Atlantic between Europe and America? And should we not, at this period in our history, be aligning ourselves clearly with Europe in evolving a distinct European world policy, rather than leaning towards Washington.

After Britain&#x27;s victory in the Falklands War Barnett spoke of the &quot;courage, professionalism and ultimate success of our Falklands task force&quot; but added:The lesson of the Falklands crises is not that we need a blue-water surface fleet in case of similar residual bits of pink on the map come under attack, but that we should bring our foreign policy into congruence with our defence policy and shed such unprofitable bits of pink in good time. The real guilty men of the crisis are the MPs of both parties who, in the past, blocked possible deals with the Argentine with emotional cries of &quot;sell-out&quot; without apparently reckoning the possible cost of defending the Falklands against the value of the islands to the United Kingdom. Can it now be really argued that a capability to do another Falklands somewhere in the wide oceans is more important to our security of this country than the preservation of Western Europe, our own outer rampart and our greatest market?

Barnett said of the Franks Report which investigated the Falklands War: &quot;...the British Establishment has sat in judgment on the British Establishment and found it not guilty...What is therefore needed is a critical examination of the Foreign Office as an institution: its collective &#x27;house style&#x27; and outlook; the personalities and characters of its leading figures. Only then shall we understand how British policy evolves in terms of a specific situation like the Falklands&quot;.

In a 1996 interview, Barnett stated his belief that Britain&#x27;s future lay with a form of federated Europe, including the adoption of the European single currency. He criticised Eurosceptics as &quot;emotional idealists nostalgic for a lost past&quot;.

Barnett opposed British participation in the Kosovo War of 1999, arguing that Yugoslavia was &quot;a sovereign state committing no aggression beyond its own borders, [the military action against it] is a breach of the UN Charter and likewise of the North Atlantic Treaty&quot;. Furthermore, on 30 March 1999 he claimed that the war&#x27;s course had vindicated his original stance on &quot;Nato&#x27;s ill-thought-out policy, based on emotion and simplistic moralising...In particular, it has plunged the Kosovans, the objects of Nato&#x27;s solicitude, into their present calamity&quot;. Later that year Barnett returned to the subject, saying that the 80-day-long air campaign against Serbian forces demonstrated &quot;that air power is a clumsy means of political coercion&quot; and &quot;that Bosnia should have served as a warning to us not to get entangled over Kosovo, and that if we did get entangled, we would finish up to our necks in trouble – which we have&quot;.
In early August 2002, Barnett wrote to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; opposing the American plan of invading Iraq, rejecting the claim that those opposed to the war were the equivalent of the appeasers of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. He claimed that whereas Nazi Germany was disrupting the balance of power in Europe, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq posed no threat to the region. Moreover, he argued that the opposition stemmed from the view that it &quot;would be a breach of international law to attack a sovereign state and member of the UN that is not currently guilty of any external aggression; and two, that the execution of such an attack could lead to prolonged and unforeseeable adverse military and political consequences&quot;.

In December 2002, he argued that, in light of the UK Government&#x27;s decision to allow the United States to use bases in Britain for its proposed anti-missile defence system (&quot;Star Wars Mk II&quot;), then Britain &quot;should surely re-examine the utility to this country of the &quot;special relationship&quot; with America at the present degree of intimacy&quot;.

In January 2003, Barnett wrote that Britain&#x27;s close relationship with the United States put Britain &quot;in greater danger from Islamic terrorism rather than confers security against it. If we join in an attack on Iraq as America&#x27;s satellite, that danger will become more acute&quot;.

Writing in August 2003, Barnett claimed that his predictions on the aftermath of the war had come to pass, saying that &quot;some of us are on record since summer 2002 as warning that an attack on Iraq would end with the attackers bogged down in a politico-military mess of some kind or other&quot;. In September that same year Barnett likened the Iraq War to the Suez Crisis of 1956.

In December 2003, Barnett published an article in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, asserting that Al-Qaeda was winning the &quot;war on terror&quot;—a label Barnett rejects because &quot;you cannot in logic wage war against a phenomenon, only against a specific enemy... America is combating not &#x27;terrorism&#x27; but a specific terrorist network, al-Qa&#x27;eda&quot;. Barnett further claimed that terrorist organisations are &quot;entirely rational in purpose and conduct&quot; in that they conform to Clausewitzian ideas. He claims the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan were mistaken in that they &quot;opened up long American flanks vulnerable to increasing guerrilla attack: a classic case of strategic overextension&quot; and that Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime had no links to Al-Qaeda. He claims that the United States Army in Iraq should be replaced with UN troops from Muslim states to quell resentment and to &quot;isolate the insurgents&quot;. In order to defeat Al-Qaeda, Barnett argues, the United States should &quot;recognise that combating terrorists is essentially a job for special forces like the SAS, for the police or gendarmerie (or troops trained in a gendarmerie role) and, above all, for good intelligence (meaning, at best, spies inside al-Qa&#x27;eda cells) – and not a job for heavy-weight hi-tech firepower&quot;.

After Lord Hutton published his report in early 2004, Barnett wrote that Lord Hutton&#x27;s &quot;conclusions are totally at variance with the wealth of documentary evidence and witness statements presented to his inquiry and published on the internet&quot;, citing Lord Hutton&#x27;s claim that &quot;there was no dishonourable or underhand strategy&quot; in leaking Dr. David Kelly&#x27;s name when Downing Street and the Ministry of Defence &quot;conspired&quot; to do so. Furthermore, he argued that Lord Hutton&#x27;s &quot;judgement is so unbalanced in its treatment of the BBC and of Downing Street and the MoD as to be worthless&quot; except as a way for Tony Blair to &quot;escape&quot; from an investigation on &quot;whether or not he did take us to war on a false prospectus&quot;.

After fellow military historian Sir John Keegan demanded to know why those who opposed the Iraq War wanted Saddam Hussein to remain in power, Barnett replied that &quot;America, Britain, the Middle East and the wider world would be vastly better off in terms of peace and stability if Saddam were still gripping Iraq, and we were still gripping Saddam as we had been from 1991 to 2003&quot;. He explained that the condition of the Iraqi people under Saddam Hussein &quot;is of no relevance&quot; to non-Iraqis; secondly, he argued that Saddam Hussein &quot;had presented no international danger since he was soundly beaten in the 1991 Gulf war. He possessed no weapons of mass destruction...and he was subject to close Anglo-American surveillance of the &quot;no-fly zone&quot;&quot;; thirdly, &quot;Saddam had provided a highly competent ally, if a tacit one, in the so-called &quot;war against global terror&quot;&quot; due to his opposition to Al-Qaeda.

During the 2005 general election, Barnett argued that George W. Bush and his friends &quot;were bent on toppling Saddam Hussein in pursuit of an ideological mission to convert the Middle East to democracy&quot; before Bush came to power in January 2001 and that the September 11 attacks &quot;simply provided them with a convenient cover story&quot;. Barnett concluded by saying that Blair was &quot;wholly unworthy of our trust. This is the central fact of this election, and we should vote accordingly&quot;. In late September 2005, Barnett argued that &quot;&#x27;to cut and run&#x27; [from Iraq] would in fact be the morally brave thing to do&quot; since the &quot;current strategy is failing to produce the hoped-for results, but on the contrary is running ever deeper into difficulties and danger, and yet with the final result all in doubt&quot;. Barnett contrasted Blair to Clement Attlee, and his military withdrawals in India and Palestine, claiming that no British lives were lost in them.

In October 2005, he said of Margaret Thatcher:Ever since the war we had lived in a form of state socialism with tremendous controls and regulations over economic and social life. I can remember when you couldn&#x27;t even buy a house abroad without special permission from the Bank of England. People who think the pre-Thatcher years were a golden age really didn&#x27;t live through them: just ask anyone who rode on the clapped-out railways or tried to make a telephone call when the Post Office ran the phones. When she came to power she transformed the country. The moribund industries relying on taxpayer funding - all gone. The trade unions - all gone. She abolished exchange controls, completely liquidated the state sector of industry and threw the economy wide open. It&#x27;s certainly true that she was so powerful a person that cabinet government in the collegiate sense began to diminish. More and more they were like a collection of staff officers around the general. Blair has taken that further and deliberately adopted a presidential style in every possible way. The main difference was that she had genuine feeling, conviction and leadership. In my view, during the last eight years, Blair has proved a very plausible conman who promises much but hasn&#x27;t achieved it.

==Honours==
Barnett was a fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge and from 1977 to 1995 he was the Keeper of the Churchill Archives Centre. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, the Royal Historical Society and the Royal Society of Arts. From 1973 to 1985, he was a member of the Council of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

==Influence==
There were some Cabinet Ministers in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government who were influenced by Barnett&#x27;s works. Sir Keith Joseph, Education Secretary from 1981 to 1986, admired Barnett&#x27;s work about the anti-business culture in education and in an interview with Anthony Seldon he proclaimed: &quot;I&#x27;m a Correlli Barnett supporter&quot;. Nigel Lawson, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1983 to 1989, also cited Barnett&#x27;s views on education as an influence, specifically &quot;The Audit of War&quot;. In 1995 when Michael Heseltine became Deputy Prime Minister in John Major&#x27;s Cabinet, he presented each member of the Cabinet with copies of Barnett&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Victory&quot;. Barnett&#x27;s comment that &quot;an attack on Iran would effectively launch world war three&quot; was cited by Noam Chomsky in his essay &quot;A Predator Becomes More Dangerous Once Wounded&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1950, Barnett married Ruth Murby. The couple had two daughters. Ruth died in 2020. Barnett died on 10 July 2022 at the age of 95 in East Carleton in Norfolk.

<text>Smoothwall (formerly styled as SmoothWall) is a Linux distribution designed to be used as an open source firewall. Smoothwall is configured via a web-based GUI and requires little or no knowledge of Linux to install or use.

Smoothwall is also a private software company based in the UK who specializes in the development of web content filtering, safeguarding and internet security solutions, which also maintains the SmoothWall open source project.

==History==

Smoothwall began life as Smoothwall GPL in 2000 as a freely redistributable piece of open source software. In 2001, they released a proprietary version that is currently the primary distribution of the software containing extra features. Smoothwall still maintains its open source version with Smoothwall Express (latest release V3.1 in 2014). Smoothwall&#x27;s filtering and safeguarding products are typically sold into educational organizations and businesses.

In 2017, Smoothwall announced a management buyout backed by private equity fund, Tenzing. The new management team was led by Georg Ell, previously Director of Western Europe at Tesla, who was appointed as Group CEO in May 2018. Georg was joined by existing Board members Gavin Logan, Douglas Hanley and Manprit Randhawan in the management of the Smoothwall business, along with Lisa Stone, who took the position as chairperson.

On 5 August 2021, Tenzing announced they had agreed to sell their investment in Smoothwall to Australian security firm Family Zone Cyber Safety for £75.5 million (A$142m cash consideration.) The deal was completed on 17 August 2021, with a £10.5m deferred balance of the sale price paid on 1 September 2021.

==Smoothwall Express==

Smoothwall Express, originally &quot;Smoothwall GPL&quot;, is the freely distributable version of Smoothwall, developed by the Smoothwall Open Source Project team and members of Smoothwall Ltd.

Released in August 2000, Smoothwall GPL was developed by Lawrence Manning and Richard Morrell to provide a quick and easy-to-use solution to the problem of sharing their ISDN connections with the rest of their LAN. Created using Red Hat Linux, Smoothwall GPL originally had two simple functions: control the modem to dial and hang up, and to route TCP/IP packets from the LAN to the Internet connection, and back again. The LAN was hidden from the public network by NAT, applied using ipchains.

Beginning with 0.9 in August 2000, the Smoothwall GPL 0.9.x series went through several versions based on the 2.2 Linux kernel, culminating in 0.9.9 SE in December 2001, which was probably the most popular GPL release. Each release led to a number of improvements, including PAT (port address translation), DMZ, PSTN and ISDN dial-up support, broadband (ADSL and Cable) support.

Smoothwall GPL 1.0 was released in December 2002, including all previously released patches and security fixes, and ended development of the 0.9.x/1.0 series, although it was supported by errata updates for another year and a half.

==Smoothwall Limited==
In late 2001, Manning and Morrell, with George Lungley, formed Smoothwall Limited as a UK-registered private limited company. The company was formed to take the open source software and commercialise it, by expanding the software to include corporate and enterprise oriented functionality, and to provide dedicated support staff for customers to contact.

Now based in Yarfort, with a USA office in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company has continued to develop the commercial, closed source Smoothwall product range, while moving from its initial direct sales model to a reseller, channel-based sales model.

===Past Products===

Smoothwall Server Edition was the first product from Smoothwall Ltd., released on 11 November 2001. It was essentially Smoothwall GPL 0.9.9 with support included from the company. This was — as were virtually all future products — made available to purchase on CD-ROM directly from Smoothwall Ltd. by mail order.

Initially announced in January 2002, and priced at £30, but never released, Smoothwall Home Server was an aborted attempt to tap into the home and residential market. It used the open source platform again as a base but included SmoothGuard, and would have permitted customers to make email support requests directly from Smoothwall Ltd.

Released on 17 December 2001, Smoothwall Corporate Server 1.0 was the first in a long line of separate, closed source releases from Smoothwall Ltd. Forked from Smoothwall GPL 0.9.9SE, Corporate Server included additional features such as SCSI support, and the capability to increase functionality via add-on modules. These modules included SmoothGuard (content filtering proxy), SmoothZone (multiple DMZ) and SmoothTunnel (advanced VPN features). Corporate Server was designed to become the backbone of all future products from the company, with the module functionality permitting customers to select the exact level of functionality they required. Further modules have been released over time, each providing a particular set of functionality, such as traffic shaping, and email anti-virus and anti-spam.

After Daniel Barron, author of DansGuardian, joined the company in April 2002, a variant of Corporate Server called Smoothwall Corporate Guardian was released, integrating a fork of DansGuardian called SmoothGuardian. Corporate Guardian is a stand-alone web proxy, cache and filtering solution. SmoothGuardian was also made available as a stand-alone module for Corporate Server customers, replacing the SmoothGuard module.

School guardian was created as a variant of corporate guardian, adding Active Directory/LDAP authentication support and firewall features in a package designed specifically for use in schools.

When released on 13 June 2005, version 4 of Corporate Server was renamed to Corporate Firewall. In February 2008, Corporate Guardian was renamed to Network Guardian with the release of the 2008 version.

Released on 9 May 2005, Smoothwall Advanced Firewall targeted the enterprise market directly by bundling Corporate Server with all available add-on modules, and adding further functionality, including Active Directory, eDirectory &amp; LDAP authentication and the capability to use up to 20 network interfaces with external connection load balancing.

In April 2007, the company released the SmoothGuard UTM-1000 hardware appliance, based on a commodity Intel Core 2 Duo 1U 19-inch rack-mountable chassis. The UTM-1000 came pre-installed with a variant of Smoothwall Advanced Firewall.

<text>Jane Eaglen (born 4 April 1960) is an English dramatic soprano particularly known for her interpretations of the works of Richard Wagner and the title roles in Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; and Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;. Her career at the Metropolitan Opera started with her Brunhilde in the Ring Cycle. Eaglen has performed at all major houses globally such as La Scalla, the Metropolitan Opera House and many others. She currently resides in Boston, MA as a voice teacher at the famous New England Conservatory where she is training the next generation of world class singers. She is the President and founder of the Boston Wagner Society. Eaglen spends her summers instructing at the prestigious Merola opera training program for emerging artists. She is very active in her community. Every year she judges several voice competitions including the Laffont-Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions.

==Background==
Jane Eaglen was born 4 April 1960 in Lincoln, England. She attended South Park High School in Lincoln. She lived on Peel Street. A neighbour noticed Eaglen&#x27;s musical interest, and she started piano lessons at the age of five, continuing until she was sixteen. Her piano teacher then suggested she take singing lessons, and for a year she studied with a local teacher.

After being turned down by the Guildhall School in London, Eaglen auditioned at age eighteen for Joseph Ward, the voice professor at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Ward recognized her potential, and took Eaglen on as a student. Within weeks Ward had directed her toward roles such as Norma and Brünnhilde.

In 1984 she joined the English National Opera, and she spent a couple of years singing the First Lady in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; and Berta, the servant in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot;. Other roles included Leonora in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;. She was also cast as Santuzza in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot;.

Eaglen broke into the major opera scene when she was cast as Donna Anna in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the Scottish Opera. She went on to sing Brünnhilde and the title roles in &quot;Tosca&quot; and &quot;Norma&quot; with that company. She made her American debut as Norma in 1994 with Seattle Opera as a last-minute replacement for Carol Vaness, and followed, two weeks later with Brünnhilde at Opera Pacific, a last-minute replacement for Ealynn Voss. Her first Isolde came in 1998 with the Seattle Opera, a company she has returned to consistently. She repeated the role in 1999 at the Metropolitan Opera and in 2000 in Chicago.

==Career==
Eaglen has performed the roles of Isolde (for the Metropolitan Opera, Seattle Opera, Gran Teatro del Liceu (Barcelona), Lyric Opera of Chicago, and in Puerto Rico), Leonore, and Brünnhilde (performed in Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Milan, New York and the UK). Other major performances include Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; (performed for the Metropolitan Opera, Seattle Opera, Ravenna Festival with Maestro Muti, and the Bastille); Ariadne for Seattle Opera and in London; Senta (&quot;Der Fliegende Holländer&quot;) in concert with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra; Ortrud (&quot;Lohengrin&quot;) and Helen (&quot;Amelia&quot;) for Seattle Opera; &quot;La Gioconda&quot; in Chicago and London; Donna Anna in New York, Vienna, Los Angeles, Munich and Bologna; and many others.

Her work on the concert platform includes performances of Strauss’ Four Last Songs&quot; with Daniel Barenboim with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and Gerard Schwarz with the Czech Philharmonic; Strauss&#x27; final scene of &quot;Salome&quot; with Zubin Mehta and the New York Philharmonic, and Richard Hickox and the London Symphony Orchestra; Wagner&quot;s &quot;Immolation Scene&quot; with both Bernard Haitink and Jeffrey Tate and the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and Zubin Mehta and the NY Phil; Verdi&#x27;s Requiem with Daniele Gatti and the Orchestra of St Cecilia, Rome; Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Eighth Symphony&quot; with Klaus Tennstedt; &quot;Nabucco&quot; with Riccardo Muti for the Ravenna Festival; &quot;Gurrelieder&quot; with Claudio Abbado for the Salzburg and Edinburgh Festivals; &quot;Die Walküre&quot; and &quot;Siegfried&quot; with James Conlon in Cologne; and many others.

Eaglen&#x27;s many solo albums include arias by Wagner and Bellini, arias by Strauss and Mozart, Strauss&#x27; &quot;Four Last Songs&quot; and other song cycles, and Italian Opera Arias. Her recording of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; with Daniel Barenboim for Teldec earned a Grammy for &#x27;Best Complete Opera&#x27;. She may also be heard in Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony with Chailly for Decca; in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ninth Symphony&quot; with Abbado for Sony; as Tosca for Chandos; as Norma with Muti for EMI, and in the title role of Opera Rara&#x27;s recently re-released &quot;Medea in Corinto&quot;. In addition, Eaglen is featured on Sony&#x27;s soundtrack for the film adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. Her 2007 season included Isolde in &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; in Spain; Lady Macbeth in &quot;Macbeth&quot; at Vancouver; Senta in &quot;Der Fliegende Holländer&quot; in the U.S.; &quot;Tosca&quot; in Japan; &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; in Hungary; and Brünnhilde in &quot;Die Walküre&quot; in Norway.

Eaglen was named an honorary Doctor of Musical Arts in 2005 by McGill University, Montreal. Formerly a member of the voice faculty at Baldwin-Wallace College and the artistic faculty of the Seattle Opera Young Artists Program, she teaches at New England Conservatory of Music.

In conjunction with her performance travel, Eaglen works with artist programs such as the Merola Opera Program and the Cardiff International Academy of Voice, and frequently teaches master classes. In July 2009, Eaglen received an honorary doctorate from Bishop Grosseteste University College Lincoln. She became a Doctor of the University College.

In 2010, Eaglen was named International Fellow in Voice at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD) in Glasgow, where she will give master classes and recitals. She is a Fellow of the Royal Northern College of Music.

<doc id="1239366" wikidata="Q5631559" url="?curid=1239366" title="HMS Berkeley Castle (K387)">
<text>HMS &quot;Berkeley Castle&quot; was a of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. Built and commissioned in 1943, she escorted convoys from 1944 to 1945. She later served as an air-sea rescue ship until being placed in reserve. Damaged beyond repair in the North Sea flood of 1953 while at a dry dock in Sheerness, she was scrapped a few years later. She was named after Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire.

==Design==
The s were an improved and enlarged derivative of the earlier s, which was intended to be built by shipyards that could not build the larger and more capable frigates. The greater length of the Castles gave made them better seaboats than the Flowers, which were not originally designed for ocean escort work. Large numbers (96 in total) were ordered in late 1942 and early 1943 from shipyards in the United Kingdom and Canada, but Allied successes in the Battle of the Atlantic meant that the requirement for escorts was reduced, and many ships (including all the Canadian ones) were cancelled.

The Castles were long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars. Beam was and draught was aft at full load. Displacement was about standard and full load. Two Admiralty Three-drum water tube boilers fed steam to a vertical triple expansion engine rated at which drove a single propeller shaft. This gave a speed of . 480 tons of oil were carried, giving a range of at .

The ships had a main gun armament of a single QF 4-inch Mk XIX dual-purpose gun, backed up by two twin and two single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Anti-submarine armament consisted of a single triple-barrelled Squid anti-submarine mortar with 81 depth charges backed up by two depth charge throwers and a single depth charge rail, with 15 depth charges carried. Type 272 or Type 277 surface search radar was fitted, as was high-frequency direction finding (HF/DF) gear. The ships&#x27; sonar outfit was Type 145 and Type 147B.

==Service==
&quot;Berkeley Castle&quot; was one of five Castle-class corvettes ordered on 2 February 1943. She was laid down at the Barclay Curle shipyard in Glasgow on 23 April 1943, launched on 19 August and commissioned on 18 November 1943. &quot;Berkeley Castle&quot; was the second ship of that name to serve with the Royal Navy.

After working up, &quot;Berkeley Castle&quot; joined the 15th Escort Group, escorting her first convoy in late January 1944. On 1 March 1944, she joined the 40th Escort Group, operating on the Gibraltar convoy route, and on 23 May transferred to the B5 Escort Group, with the same duties. On 10 September 1944, the B5 Escort Group was renamed the 31st Escort Group, with &quot;Berkeley Castle&quot; as Senior Officer&#x27;s ship, and returned to UK coastal waters, continuing to the end of the war in Europe.

&quot;Berkeley Castle&quot; was then employed as an air-sea rescue ship until mid 1946, when she was placed in reserve at Harwich. She was refitted at London in 1949, before returning to reserve. On the night of 31 January/1 February 1953, &quot;Berkeley Castle&quot; was in dry dock at the naval dockyard at Sheerness, Kent when Sheerness was struck by the North Sea flood of 1953. The tidal surge overtopped the dock gates, flooding the dry dock and causing &quot;Berkeley Castle&quot; to float off her blocks and capsize. She was refloated, but damage was such that she was beyond economic repair and was not repaired. She was placed on the disposal list in 1955. She arrived at Thos. W. Ward&#x27;s breaking yard in Grays, Essex, on 29 February 1956 for scrapping. Prior to demolition she was used for filming the comedy &quot;Up The Creek&quot; as the fictitious HMS Berkeley.

<text>The Khilafat movement (1919–22) was a political campaign launched by Indian Muslims in British India over British policy against Turkey and the planned dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire after World War I by Allied forces.

Leaders participating in the movement included Ahmad Sagheer Haji Variyami, Shaukat Ali, Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan, and Abul Kalam Azad who organised the movement to redress the grievances of Turkey.

Mahatma Gandhi had supported the movement as part of his opposition to the British Empire, and he also advocated for a wider non-cooperation movement at the same time. Vallabhbhai Patel, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and other Hindu and Congress figures also supported the movement.

Generally described as a protest against the sanctions placed on the Ottoman Empire after the First World War by the Treaty of Sèvres, the movement is also noted for promoting Hindu-Muslim unity. It ended in 1922 after the end of the non-cooperation movement.

==Background==

Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II (1842–1918) launched his pan-Islamist program in a bid to protect the Ottoman Empire from Western attack and dismemberment and to crush the democratic opposition at home. He sent an emissary, Jamaluddin Afghani, to India in the late 19th century. The cause of the Ottoman monarch evoked religious passion and sympathy amongst Indian Muslims. Being the caliph, the Ottoman sultan was nominally the supreme religious and political leader of all Sunni Muslims across the world. However, this authority was never actually used.

A large number of Muslim religious leaders began working to spread awareness and develop Muslim participation on behalf of the caliphate. Muslim religious leader Maulana Mehmud Hasan attempted to organize a national war of independence with support from the Ottoman Empire.

Abdul Hamid II was forced to restore the constitutional monarchy, marking the start of the Second Constitutional Era by the Young Turk Revolution. He was succeeded by his brother Mehmed V (1844–1918) but following the revolution, the real power in the Ottoman Empire lay with the Young Turks. The movement was a topic in Conference of London (February 1920); however, nationalist Arabs saw it as threat of continuation of Turkish dominance of Arab lands.

===Partitioning===
The Ottoman Empire, having sided with the Central Powers during World War I, suffered a major military defeat. The Treaty of Versailles (1919) reduced its territorial extent and diminished its political influence but the victorious Europe powers promised to protect the Ottoman sultan&#x27;s status as the caliph. However, under the Treaty of Sèvres (1920), territories such as Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq were severed from the empire.

Within Turkey, a progressive, secular nationalist movement arose, known as the Turkish national movement. During the Turkish War of Independence (1919–1923), the Turkish revolutionaries, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, abolished the Treaty of Sèvres with the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). Pursuant to Atatürk&#x27;s Reforms, the Republic of Turkey abolished the position of the caliphate in 1924. Atatürk offered the caliphate to Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi, on the condition that he reside outside Turkey; Senussi declined the offer and confirmed his support for Abdulmejid. The title was then claimed by Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca and Hejaz, leader of the Arab Revolt, but his kingdom was defeated and annexed by Ibn Saud in 1925.

==Khilafat Movement in Indian Subcontinent==

Although political activities and popular outcry on behalf of the caliphate emerged across the Muslim world, the most prominent activities took place in India. A prominent Oxford educated Muslim journalist, Maulana Muhammad Ali Johar had spent four years in prison for advocating resistance to the colonial government and support for the caliphate. At the onset of the Turkish War of Independence, Muslim religious leaders feared for the caliphate, which the European powers were reluctant to protect. To some of the Muslims of India, the prospect of being conscripted to fight against fellow Muslims in Turkey was anathema. To its founders and followers, the Khilafat was not a religious movement but rather a show of solidarity with their fellow Muslims in Turkey. 

Mohammad Ali and his brother Maulana Shaukat Ali joined with other Muslim leaders such as Pir Ghulam Mujaddid Sarhandi, Sheikh Shaukat Ali Siddiqui, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Raees-Ul-Muhajireen Barrister Jan Muhammad Junejo, Hasrat Mohani, Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari, Mohammad Farooq Chishti, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Dr. Hakim Ajmal Khan to form the All India Khilafat Committee. The organisation was based in Lucknow, India at Hathe Shaukat Ali, the compound of Landlord Shaukat Ali Siddiqui. They aimed to build political unity amongst Muslims and use their influence to protect the caliphate. In 1920, they published the Khilafat Manifesto, which called upon the British to protect the caliphate and for Indian Muslims to unite and hold the British accountable for this purpose. The Khilafat Committee in Bengal included Mohmmad Akram Khan, Manruzzaman Islamabadi, Mujibur Rahman Khan and Chittaranjan Das.

In 1920 an alliance was made between Khilafat leaders and the Indian National Congress, the largest political party in India and of the nationalist movement. Congress leader Mahatma Gandhi and the Khilafat leaders promised to work and fight together for the causes of Khilafat and &quot;Swaraj&quot;. Seeking to increase pressure on the colonial government, the Khilafatists became a major part of the non-cooperation movement — a nationwide campaign of mass, peaceful civil disobedience. Some also engaged in a protest emigration from North-West Frontier Province to Afghanistan under Amanullah Khan. 

The movement also saw donations by Indians to help in this movement. A committee was also started for sending funds to help Ankara government of Mustafa Kemal.

The non-cooperation campaign was at first successful. The programme started with boycott of legislative councils, government schools, colleges and foreign goods. Government functions and surrender of titles and distinctions. Massive protests, strikes and acts of civil disobedience spread across India. Hindus and Muslims joined forces in the campaign, which was initially peaceful. Gandhi, the Ali brothers and others were swiftly arrested by the colonial government. Under the flag of Tehrik-e-Khilafat, a Punjab Khilafat deputation comprising Moulana Manzoor Ahmed and Moulana Lutfullah Khan Dankauri took a leading role throughout India, with a particular concentration in the Punjab (Sirsa, Lahore, Haryana etc.). People from villages such as Aujla Khurd were the main contributors to the cause. 

Although holding talks with the colonial government and continuing their activities, the Khilafat movement weakened as Muslims were divided between working for the Congress, the Khilafat cause and the Muslim League.

The Khilafat leadership fragmented on different political lines. Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari created Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam with the support of Chaudhry Afzal Haq. Leaders such as Dr. Ansari, Maulana Azad and Hakim Ajmal Khan remained strong supporters of Gandhi and the Congress. The Ali brothers joined Muslim League.

==Challenges to British colonization==
Up to the turn of the 20th century, the British system of political control was effective in Sindh. During the Khilafat movement, however, the British dealt with another major challenge to their rule.

The Khilafat movement represented the first occasion on which a major number of Sindhi pirs came together on a common platform to oppose British policy, and their involvement showed the way in which they were being gradually involved in the issues of the broader Indian Muslim community. Similar to their co-religionists elsewhere, many of these pirs were affected due to the rise in pan-Islamic sentiment and also by the changing awareness of the position of Muslims in South Asia. Their participation in the agitation severely threatened to undermine the position of the British colonial rule in Sindh. Yet, regardless of the significant influence of the pirs and the considerable support which they attracted for the Khilafat cause, the system of control proved its credibility by reducing the threat posed to British rule to one of manageable proportions.

The British system of control was seriously threatened by the involvement of Sindhi pirs in the Khilafat movement. The concerns of the movement appealed strongly to a major section of the province&#x27;s religious leadership as a result of the rise in interest in pan-Islamic issues during the years leading up to 1919. Support for broader Islamic concerns during this period was directly associated with the gradual erosion of the barriers which had isolated the Sindh region from developments taking place.

==Legacy==
The movement is noted to have played a role in boosting unity among Hindus and Muslims. The Congress supported the movement in response to the divide and rule strategy by the British. The period of 1919-1922 is widely seen as the heyday of Hindu-Muslim unity. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk had thanked the Congress for its sympathy, and hoped that it would soon gain Swaraj.

The movement is described as a milestone in the growth of the Muslim nationalism and the history of civil disobedience in India. For example, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had at the time been a force for Hindu-Muslim unity in the aftermath of the 1916 Lucknow Pact, left the Congress after his words of caution against the entangling of the secular independence movement with the religious elements of the Khilafat movement were not heeded; later on, he became a key leader of the Pakistan Movement. Critics, however, argue that the Khilafat movement was not nationalist or anti-imperialist, but rather that its religious rhetoric concealed a weak and uncertain religious agenda.

Omair Anas, writing for the Turkish outlet &quot;Daily Sabah&quot;, noted that &quot;It is impossible to recall Turkey&#x27;s anti-colonial struggle without mentioning Gandhi&#x27;s support for the unity and integrity of the then-crumbling Ottoman Empire.&quot;

<text>Maureen Kathleen Stewart Forrester, (July 25, 1930 – June 16, 2010) was a Canadian operatic contralto.

==Life and career==
Maureen Forrester was born and grew up in Montreal, Quebec, one of four children of Thomas Forrester, a British cabinetmaker from Scotland, and his Irish-born wife, the former May Arnold. She sang in church and radio choirs. At age 13, she dropped out of school to help support the family, working as a secretary at Bell Telephone.

When her brother came home from the war he persuaded her to take singing lessons. She paid for voice lessons with Sally Martin, Frank Rowe, and baritone Bernard Diamant. In the spring of 1951, Forrester appeared on the CBC radio talent competition &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;, singing &quot;Ombra mai fu&quot;, and describing herself to the host as a &quot;starving musician&quot; and part-time switchboard operator. She was ultimately named first runner-up, and later competed on the similar shows &quot;Singing Stars of Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;Nos Futures Étoiles&quot;.

She gave her debut recital at the local YWCA in 1953. She made her concert debut in Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra under Otto Klemperer.
She toured extensively in Canada and Europe with Jeunesses Musicales. She made her New York City debut in Town Hall in 1956. Bruno Walter invited her to sing for him; he was looking for the right contralto for a performance and recording of the Mahler Symphony No. 2 &quot;Resurrection&quot;. This was the start of a warm relationship with great rapport. Walter had been a protégé of Mahler, and he trained Forrester in interpretation of his works. She performed at Walter&#x27;s farewell performances with the New York Philharmonic in 1957.

In 1957, she married the Toronto violinist and conductor Eugene Kash. The couple had five children, including actors Linda Kash and Daniel Kash. Forrester converted to Judaism.

She performed regularly in concert and opera. At the New York City Opera, she sang Cornelia in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; (1966), opposite Norman Treigle and Beverly Sills, which was recorded by RCA in 1967. She sang at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1975 in &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; (Erda), &quot;Siegfried&quot;, and &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;. Forrester also provided the voice of the Bianca Castafiore character in the television series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. She was a strong champion of Canadian composers, regularly scheduling their works in her programs, especially when she toured abroad. A notable example is composer Donald Steven, whose work &quot;Pages of Solitary Delights&quot; (winner of the 1987 Juno Award for Classical Composition of the Year) was written for Ms. Forrester. From 1983-88 she served as Chair of the Canada Council.

In 1986, she co-authored her autobiography, &quot;Out of Character&quot; (), with journalist Marci McDonald.

==Death==
Maureen Forrester died on June 16, 2010, aged 79, in Toronto, after a long battle with dementia. She was predeceased by Eugene Kash, her former husband, whom she had divorced in 1974, and who died in 2004. She was survived by her five children.

<text>Pierre Léon Marie Fournier (24 June 19068 January 1986) was a French cellist who was called the &quot;aristocrat of cellists&quot; on account of his elegant musicianship and majestic sound.

==Biography==
Pierre Fournier was born in Paris, the son of a French Army general. His mother taught him to play the piano, but he had a mild case of polio as a child and lost dexterity in his feet and legs. Having difficulties with the piano pedals, he turned to the cello at the age of nine.

He received early training from Odette Krettly, and from 1918 studied with André Hekking and later with Paul Bazelaire. He graduated from the Paris Conservatory at 17, in 1923. He was hailed as &quot;the cellist of the future&quot; and won praise for his virtuosity and bowing technique. In the period 1925–1929 he was a member of the Krettly Quartet, led by Odette&#x27;s brother Robert Krettly.

He became well known when he played with the Concerts Colonne Orchestra in 1925. He began touring all over Europe. At various stages he played with many of the most highly acclaimed, prestigious musicians of his time, and recorded the complete chamber music of Brahms and Schubert for the BBC on acetates. However, these deteriorated before the recordings could be transferred to a more durable medium. He is also praised for his recordings of the Bach suites (Beethoven-Saal, Hannover, December 1960), which are regarded even now as some of the best versions ever made (released on Deutsche Grammophon &quot;Archive&quot; records). His other discs include LPs of Beethoven&#x27;s cello sonatas and Elgar&#x27;s Cello Concerto; these have long since been available on CD.

Fournier was a teacher at the École Normale de Musique in Paris and the Paris Conservatoire from 1937 to 1949. He made his first tour of the United States in 1948 and played to great acclaim in New York and Boston.

His performance in America became an embarrassment when it was revealed in 1949 that Fournier had collaborated with the Nazis during the occupation of France. He was found to have performed 82 times on &quot;Radio-Paris&quot;a German stationfor which he had been paid a total of 192,400 francs. In France, the &quot;National Purging Committee&#x27;s Professional Branch for Dramatic and Lyric Artists and Performing Musicians&quot; had found him guilty of collaboration, and had banned him from performing for a period of six months.

In the &#x27;50s he toured South America, often accompanied by Alfredo Rossi, a personal friend and former colleague during his early days in Italy and Spain.

After 1956, he made his home in Switzerland, although he never relinquished his French citizenship. He received the dedication of both Bohuslav Martinů&#x27;s Cello Concerto No. 1 (1930, rev. 1939, 1955) and Francis Poulenc&#x27;s Cello Sonata (1948).

In 1963, he was made a member of the Legion of Honour. He continued performing in public until two years before his death at the age of 79. Until the end of his life, he taught privately at his home in Geneva: the cellists Julian Lloyd Webber and Rocco Filippini were among his pupils.

His son Jean-Pierre became a pianist performing under the name of Jean Fonda.

Fournier played three instruments: a Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume 1863, a Matteo Goffriller 1722 (now played by Valentin Erben of Austria) and a rare Charles Adolphe Maucotel 1849. With the Maucoutel he played the last 18 years of his career and made all his recordings.

<text>Glenville State University (GSU) is a public college in Glenville, West Virginia, United States.

==History==
Glenville State University was founded in 1872 as a branch of West Virginia Normal School. It became known as &quot;Glenville State Normal School&quot;. It served the higher education needs of Central West Virginia. By 1910, the college enrollment had exceeded the population of Glenville and grew into a full four-year college by 1931.

The Glenville State College Alumni Center, known as the John E. Arbuckle House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.

On February 22, 2022, Glenville State College attained university status.

==Academics==
The college awards bachelor&#x27;s degrees, associate degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, and certificates.

In athletics, the school&#x27;s sports teams are known as Pioneers and Lady Pioneers, and they compete in the Mountain East Conference. They have teams in football, basketball, track and field, softball, golf, baseball, cross country running, acrobatics &amp; tumbling, and volleyball.

The women&#x27;s basketball team won the NCAA Division II National Championship in 2022. Their head coach Kim Stephens was then named the Women&#x27;s Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) National Coach of the Year in Division II. Stephens was also selected as the 2022 recipient of the Fufari Award, which recognizes the college coach of the year for the state of West Virginia, an award which she also won in 2019.

<text>Weißenfels (; often written in English as Weissenfels) is the largest town of the Burgenlandkreis district, in southern Saxony-Anhalt, central Germany. It is situated on the river Saale, approximately south of Halle.

==History==

Perhaps the first mention of the area, before the town itself was founded occurred in 806 CE, when Charles the Younger (&quot;Karl der Jüngere&quot;), King of the Franks, fought and killed two West Slavic &quot;Knezy&quot; (princes) nearby: duke Miliduch of the Sorbs and Nessyta (possibly also a Sorbian leader). Miliduch had led a Sorbian invasion of Austrasia.

The settlement arose around a castle on a ford crossing the Saale and received municipal rights in 1185. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was badly damaged and the population fell from 2200 to 960. On 7 November 1632 the body of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was first laid out at Weißenfels after he had been killed the day before at the Battle of Lützen.
Shortly afterwards however, the town took a steep rise in importance, when Duke Augustus, a scion of the Saxon House of Wettin, established the Duchy of Saxe-Weissenfels in 1656 and chose Weißenfels as his residence and as the capital of the duchy. Since 1638 Augustus had served as the Protestant administrator of the Magdeburg archbishopric, which, according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia would be finally secularised to Brandenburg-Prussia upon his death.

Augustus therefore from 1660 onward erected the Baroque Neu-Augustusburg Castle on a hill in Weißenfels as the seat of his ducal successors. Completed in 1680 it became the duchy&#x27;s administrative as well as cultural centre until its dissolution in 1746. Composers like Johann Philipp Krieger and Georg Philipp Telemann worked here, the actress Friederike Caroline Neuber made her first appearances at Weißenfels. In 1702 Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s application for the position of the organist in Sangerhausen (belonging to Weißenfels) failed, because the Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels preferred the—rediscovered in 2010—composer Johann Augustin Kobelius. In 1713 Johann Sebastian Bach dedicated his cantata &quot;Was mir behagt, ist nur die muntre Jagd, BWV 208 to Duke Christian of Saxe-Weissenfels.

The Lutheran theologian Erdmann Neumeister from 1704 on served as a deacon at the ducal palace&#x27;s Trinity Chapel. Its pipe organ completed in 1673 has 22 stops. According to John Mainwaring, Duke Johann Adolf I of Saxe-Weissenfels himself discovered the musical talent of George Frideric Handel, when he heard the son of his physician Georg Händel playing on the organ. Bach wrote the &quot;Toccata and Fugue in F major&quot; (BWV 540) for it.

With the extinction of the Wettin Saxe-Weissenfels line in 1746, the town fell back to the Saxon Electorate and after the 1815 Congress of Vienna to the Prussian Province of Saxony. From 1816 on it was the capital of the Weißenfels district until its dissolution in 2007.

===Population===
Development of the town&#x27;s population &quot;(from 1960 as at 31 December)&quot;:


===Incorporations===

On 1 January 1995 Weißenfels absorbed the former municipality Borau. Since an administrative reform on 1 January 2010, Weißenfels also comprises the former municipalities of Langendorf, Markwerben and Uichteritz. On 1 September 2010, the former municipalities of Burgwerben, Großkorbetha, Leißling, Reichardtswerben, Schkortleben, Storkau, Tagewerben and Wengelsdorf joined the town. These 12 former municipalities are now &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions of Weißenfels.

==Politics==

Seats in the municipal council (&quot;Stadtrat&quot;) as of 2014 elections:
==Economy==
Since the 19th century industrialisation, shoe manufacture was Weißenfels&#x27; primary industry, until 1991 when the last factory shut down. Since then, the food processing industry has grown significantly. The main companies are:
* Frischli dairy 
* Tönnies Fleischwerk, Europe&#x27;s third biggest meat group, runs one of its three meat-processing plants in Weißenfels
* Mitteldeutsche Erfrischungsgetränke, the third largest mineral water company of Germany, has its seat in Weißenfels. Its brands include &quot;Leißlinger Mineralwasser&quot; and &quot;Saskia-Quelle&quot;.

The town has access to the A9 at the Weißenfels junction, near the interchange with the A38. Weißenfels station is a stop on the Thuringian Railway line from Halle to Erfurt/Jena.

==Sports==
Basketball and Unihockey are the two most popular sports in town. Mitteldeutscher Basketball Club (MBC) was playing in the German national basketball league in between 1999 and 2004 and entered the league again in 2009. Unihockey Club Kreissparkasse Weißenfels won the German Unihockey championship seven times, from 2003 to 2009. The Unihockey European Cup, organized every year in order to establish the best team in Europe, was held in Weißenfels and neighbouring cities Hohenmölsen and Merseburg in January 2004.
