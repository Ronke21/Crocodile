<text>Amol Palekar (born 24 November 1944) is an Indian actor, director and producer of Hindi and Marathi cinema.

==Early life and education==
Palekar was born to Kamlakar and Suhasini Palekar in a Marathi speaking middle-class family in Mumbai. He had three sisters called Neelon, Rekha and Unnati. His father worked in the General Post Office and his mother worked in a private company. Palekar studied fine arts at the Sir J. J. School of Art, Mumbai, and commenced his artistic career as a painter. As a painter, he had seven one-man exhibitions and participated in many group shows.

== Acting career==
Although he trained in fine arts, Palekar is better known as a stage and film actor. He has been active in the avant garde theatre in India in Marathi and Hindi theatre as an actor, director and producer since 1967. His contribution to the modern Indian theatre is often overshadowed by his popularity as a lead actor in Hindi films.

As a film actor, he was most prominent in the 1970s. His image as a &quot;boy next door&quot; contrasted with the larger-than-life heroes prevalent at that time in Indian cinema. He received three Filmfare Awards and six State awards as Best Actor. His performances in regional language films in Marathi, Bengali, Malayalam and Kannada fetched him critical acclaim as well. He decided not to act after 1986 in order to concentrate on filmmaking.

As a director, he is known for the sensitive portrayal of women, selection of classic stories from Indian literature, and perceptive handling of progressive issues. He has directed several television serials on the national network such as &quot;Kachchi Dhoop&quot;, &quot;Mrignayani&quot;, &quot;Naquab&quot;, &quot;Paool Khuna&quot; and &quot;Krishna Kali&quot;.

===Theatre career===
Palekar began in Marathi experimental theatre with Satyadev Dubey, and later started his own group, &quot;Aniket&quot;, in 1972. As a theatre actor, he was part of popular plays like Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe, Hayavadana and Adhe Adhure. Following a performance on stage at the National Centre for the Performing Arts (India) (NCPA) in 1994, he returned to theatre after a gap of 25 years with the suspenseful play, Kusur (The Mistake). This play is directed by him and he also plays the lead role.

===Movie career===

Palekar made his debut in 1971 with the Marathi film &quot;Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe&quot; directed by Satyadev Dubey, which started the New Cinema Movement in Marathi.
In 1974 he was cast as an actor by Basu Chatterjee in &quot;Rajnigandha&quot;, and in the surprise low-budget hit, &quot;Chhoti Si Baat&quot;. This led to many other such roles in &quot;middle-class&quot; comedies, mostly alternative. These were mostly directed by Chatterjee or Hrishikesh Mukherjee and included films such as &quot;Gol Maal&quot; and &quot;Naram Garam&quot;. He won the Filmfare Best Actor Award for &quot;Gol Maal&quot;.

He is noted for his image of the &quot;middle-class everyman&quot; who struggles to get a job (&quot;Gol Maal&quot;), his own flat (&quot;Gharonda&quot;), a girlfriend/wife (&quot;Baaton Baaton Mein&quot;), and appreciation from his boss.

In 1979, he was paired with a sixteen-year-old Sridevi in Solva Saawan, which was her debut Hindi movie as a heroine. Amol played the role of an intellectually disabled man, a character played by Kamal Haasan in the original Tamil movie.

In 1982 he played the role of Ravi in the Malayalam movie &quot;Olangal&quot;. He turned to directing with the Marathi film &quot;Aakriet&quot;. He showed his capabilities as a director with movies such as Thodasa Roomani Ho Jaayen and Paheli. &quot;Thodasa Roomani Ho Jaayen&quot; has become a part of management courses and study pertaining to human behaviour. &quot;Paheli&quot; was India&#x27;s official entry for Best Foreign Film at the 2006 Oscars. The movie, however, did not make it to the final nominations.
He has also given his voice to an HIV/AIDS education animated software tutorial created by the nonprofit organization TeachAids. He is willing to act once again if he is given a challenging role.

==Personal life==
He married Sandhya Gokhale after his divorce from his first wife, Chitra. Palekar regards himself as an agnostic atheist.

In February 2022, Palekar was hospitalized in Pune for COVID-19 related complications.

<text>Gediminas Avenue () is the main street of Vilnius, where most of the governmental institutions of Lithuania are concentrated, including the government, parliament, Constitutional Court and ministries. It is also the location of cultural institutions such as the Lithuanian National Drama Theatre, Bank of Lithuania, Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre and Martynas Mažvydas National Library. It is also a popular shopping and dining street, with the highest average rent prices in the country. It is partially a pedestrian street in the evenings when traffic is prohibited.

Named after the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas, the street terminates at the Žvėrynas Bridge over the Neris River near Seimas Palace on one end and at the Cathedral Square and Vilnius Castle Complex on the other, passing Lukiškės Square where the Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights is located in the former KGB building. It connects the Old Town with Žvėrynas.

== History ==

The street, built in 1836, was initially known as St. George Avenue, Mickiewicz Street (), when Vilnius was under Polish rule (1922–1939). At the beginning of the Soviet occupation in 1940 it was called Stalin Avenue, later renamed Lenin Avenue. The avenue carries its present name from 1939 to 1940 and since 1989. In the Soviet period the avenue was used for demonstrations and military parades in honor of International Workers&#x27; Day on 1 May and the October Revolution on 7 November.

A portion of the avenue from the Vilnius Cathedral to Vincas Kudirka Square was thoroughly reconstructed before the celebration of the 750th anniversary of Mindaugas&#x27; coronation in 2003. The reconstructions included building an underground parking facility – the first such in Lithuania - under the Municipality Square and renovation of all kinds of pipelines and communication cables under the street. Over 100 new trees were planted. During the excavations a few archaeological findings were found and are now on display in the parking garage. Other sections of the avenue were also reconstructed; this work was completed in 2009.

<text>Ali Rıza Sergen Yalçın (; born 5 November 1972), known as Sergen Yalçın, Turkish professional football manager and former player. Yalçın is the first individual in Turkish football to win the Süper Lig both as a player and a manager with Beşiktaş.

During his playing career, Yalçın was an attacking midfielder known for his vision, creativity, and ability to dictate games. He spent the majority of his club career in Turkey, most notably with Beşiktaş, where he became a fan favorite. He also represented other major Turkish clubs, including Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray, and Trabzonspor, a rare feat in Turkish football. Internationally, he earned 37 caps and scored 5 goals for the Turkey national team, participating in UEFA Euro 1996 and UEFA Euro 2000.

After retiring as a player, Yalçın transitioned into management, taking charge of several Turkish clubs before returning to Beşiktaş as head coach in 2020. In his first full season, he led the club to a historic domestic double, winning the Süper Lig and the Turkish Cup. Despite his success, he resigned in December 2021 following a series of poor results, including a winless UEFA Champions League campaign.

==Club career==
===Early career and rise to stardom (1989–2001)===

Sergen began at Beşiktaş in the 1991–92 season and quickly became renowned for his skill and creativity. His first spell at the club saw him score 46 goals in 158 games – no mean feat for a midfielder. However, it was known that Sergen lacked professionalism. After a 4–1 defeat to Samsunspor, he was publicly criticised by the Beşiktaş deputy president due to his careless lifestyle. Sergen responded to the club official by insulting him.

Subsequently, Beşiktaş imposed a club-record fine of over £150,000. He was later forgiven after apologising, but the fine stayed. Sergen then demanded a new and improved contract which was denied by the board.

As expected, Sergen departed from the club and became Turkey’s record signing when he moved to İstanbulspor for £5.5m in the 1997–98 season. Thereafter, Sergen desired a move to the European fields and began contract negotiations with Internazionale and Milan. Terms could not be met with the Italian giants. After struggling with his weight due to months of inaction, İstanbulspor failed to offload him, so Jet-Pa (a sports company) bought his contract and arranged a loan deal with Fenerbahçe during the 1998–99 season, which involved him wearing a personalised shirt promoting the company.

Under the coaching firstly from Joachim Löw and Rıdvan Dilmen, he seemed to have buckled down to the task. But when Zdenek Zeman took over, Sergen was consistently engaged in trench warfare. Sergen publicly criticised Zeman for trying to play him on the wing, which he believed was not his best position, and was accused of faking injury to avoid training sessions. Along with many other incidents, the final straw came with the home game against Bursaspor during the 1999–2000 season. When he eventually came on as a substitute, Sergen missed a simple scoring chance, which many fans believed to have been a deliberate miss as an act of protest or pure spite. In the late stages of the game, with the score locked at 2–2, he further infuriated the supporters by strolling across to take a corner as though he had all the time in the world. Midway through the season, Sergen had his contract terminated by Fenerbahçe. Due to his terrific individual showings for the Turkey national football team, Sergen attracted attention from several foreign clubs. There were speculations about a move to Barcelona, Bayern Munich, or Borussia Dortmund.

Despite heavy speculation, Sergen finished the 1999–2000 season at arch-rivals Galatasaray and displayed impressive showings to help Galatasaray achieve the domestic double. Sergen signed for the club too late in the season to be eligible for the UEFA Cup campaign, and as Galatasaray made the trip to Leeds for the second tie of the semi-final, Sergen was instructed to report to training in Istanbul. However, instead of continuing his training in Istanbul, he took a little trip of his own to Northern Cyprus. While casinos were banned on the Turkish mainland, they remained open in Northern Cyprus, which attracted quite a lot of gambling trade from Turkey. It attracted Sergen for precisely that reason, and he spent much of his brief stay there in a casino. When he returned to Istanbul, he told manager Fatih Terim he was tired from the journey and asked if he could skip a training session. Terim, a fearsome disciplinarian, reacted explosively. Sergen skipped title celebrations after the Galatasaray board made it clear they would not have him back next season.

After UEFA Euro 2000, Sergen was on the verge of a transfer to Newcastle United, with manager Bobby Robson being a long-time admirer. The deal fell through, and he instead moved to Trabzonspor for the 2000–01 season, becoming the first player to have represented the “big four” clubs in Turkey. Sergen had never yet played for a club outside Istanbul, and it was believed that removing him from the distractions of the big city would do good for his appalling disciplinary record. Ironically, it turned out to be the most unsuccessful season of his career. At the season’s end, Trabzonspor did not wish to extend his loan deal.

Fatih Terim gave up on him at Galatasaray. Zdenek Zeman could not work with him at Fenerbahçe. He publicly criticised former national coach Mustafa Denizli after UEFA Euro 2000. British coach Gordon Milne, who worked with him at Beşiktaş, also despaired of trying to get Sergen – and his magical left foot – to the training ground on time. It was thought to be the end of Sergen Yalçın, the great ‘‘enfant terrible’’ of Turkish football.

===Journeyman years and legacy in Turkish football (2001–2007)===

Ahead of the 2001–02 season, Galatasaray manager Mircea Lucescu took a gamble and signed Sergen on loan (still from Siirt-Jet). He cast Sergen as the natural successor to Gheorghe Hagi.

The move was rewarded as Sergen repaid his manager’s faith by starring in the UEFA Champions League with two goals and two assists as Galatasaray progressed to the second group stage. Unfortunately, Sergen tore his knee ligaments and missed the rest of the season. He was told to lose weight or never play football again. After elimination from the UEFA Champions League, Mircea Lucescu insisted that if Sergen had remained fit, Galatasaray would have gone on to win the tournament. Nevertheless, Galatasaray won the league title.

In the 2002–03 season, after years of wandering, Sergen returned home to Beşiktaş. Sergen was signed on a permanent deal by Mircea Lucescu, who had also moved to Beşiktaş. Under the tutelage of Lucescu, whispers began that perhaps Sergen’s talent had finally been tamed. Sergen was finally maturing to fulfill some of his long-lost potential. Beşiktaş won the league title that season, with Sergen being the key instigator.

The 2003–04 season marked Beşiktaş’ return to the UEFA Champions League, where Sergen featured in arguably the most memorable match of his career. Roman Abramovich, who had recently become the owner of Chelsea, spent £112m on quality transfers, assembling a team of &quot;invincibles&quot;. Ahead of their match against Beşiktaş at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea was undefeated in the Abramovich era. However, Beşiktaş shocked the footballing world by winning 2–0, with both goals scored by Sergen. Although Beşiktaş was eliminated in the group stage, Sergen once again proved his class by scoring two goals and providing three assists in six matches.

In the same season, Sergen produced another remarkable moment during a match against Çaykur Rizespor in the 2003–04 league. After winning the ball near the midfield, he initiated a brilliant solo run that ended with an assist to İlhan Mansız, who finished the move with a goal. This performance earned Sergen the “Goal of the Year” award.

Before the 2006–07 season, manager Jean Tigana did not see Sergen as part of his future plans, and as a result, Beşiktaş terminated his contract with immediate effect. This enraged the fans, as Sergen was regarded as a symbolic icon of the club. Upon his departure, Sergen stated that he would always remain a Beşiktaş fan.

Sergen spent the 2006–07 season with Etimesgut Şekerspor in the TFF Second League. He later joined Eskişehirspor in the 2007–08 season, where he played a key role in helping the team secure promotion to the Süper Lig. At the end of the season, he retired from professional football.

When Sergen was asked why he never moved to Europe, he simply replied, “If I was 20 again, I would leave Turkey within three days.”

==International career==
===Under-23s===

Sergen played on the Turkey national under-23 football team at the 1993 Mediterranean Games, which they won by defeating France U21s in the semifinal and Algeria U23s in the final.

===Senior team===
Sergen made his senior debut in a friendly game against Macedonia in 1994. He would represent his nation in Euro 1996 and 2000, but injury prevented him from featuring at the FIFA World Cup in 2002. Sergen scored a total of 5 goals in 37 matches for the Turkey national team.

====Euro 1996====
UEFA Euro 1996 was Turkey&#x27;s first tournament appearance since 1954 FIFA World Cup. Sergen played a key role in qualification, scoring two goals. Sergen featured in two matches at the finals where they fell at the first hurdle, pointless and goalless. After the tournament, Sergen received several offers from the European shores, including the likes of West Ham United. Sergen&#x27;s refusal to move was made by the fact the clubs in pursuit were not bigger than Beşiktaş.

====1998 World Cup====
Sergen was fairly inactive in the national team during this period. In the opening round of 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification, Sergen came on as a second-half substitute against Belgium. Sergen went from hero to villain in the space of five minutes by contriving to get himself sent off after initially scoring a splendid half-volley on the edge of the box. Turkey went on to lose the match 2–1 at Brussels. Manager Mustafa Denizli saw Sergen as a liability and did not select him for the next 13 months. Sergen&#x27;s only other match during qualification was the 5–0 victory at San Marino, and Sergen was hugely disappointing. Turkey failed to make the finals.

====Euro 2000====
To his detractors, Sergen was a luxury item in a team which could ill afford luxuries. Those who had a fondness for decrying Sergen&#x27;s abilities have suggested that, when playing at the highest level, he glitters rather than shines. So when Sergen was given a second chance, many lashed out at Denizli&#x27;s decision to select him. Having finally accepted that he was the linchpin of his national side, Sergen dedicated himself to banish bitter memories of his past.

The opening match saw Sergen give a man of the match performance in a 3–0 victory over Northern Ireland, followed by a 1–0 victory against European champions Germany, but then shamefully defeated 1–3 to Finland. The next match against Moldova, Sergen was the maestro for the Turkish side, with his spectacular dribbling runs, shots at goal and his clairvoyant passes creating scoring chances for his teammates. It was from his corner kick that Turkey opened the scoring, and four minutes into injury time when Sergen took the stage, displacing the lead-footed Moldovan defenders one by one before slotting in a cracker from the edge of the area to give Turkey a 2–0 victory. Sergen also made history because his goal was the 400th scored in the history of the Turkey national team. Prior to the next match, Turkey had never defeated Finland in any official match since 1924. Outpaced and outplayed for 15 minutes, Turkey trailed 2–0 before Sergen intervened. The man of the match was involved in three goals as Turkey turned around a two-goal deficit to defeat Finland 2–4. Turkey gained five points from their final three matches to finish group runners-up. The final game with Germany ended 0–0, but is seen as one of the greatest individual displays in the history of the Turkey national team, as Sergen &quot;pulled all the strings&quot;, according to the German manager Erich Ribbeck. As group runners-up, Turkey faced the Republic of Ireland in a play-off tie to qualify for Euro 2000. The Irish entered the match as favorites mainly due to their influential skipper, Roy Keane. In the first leg, Ireland could only do with a 1–1 draw in Dublin. Eamonn Sweeney of the Irish Examiner wrote the match report.

The second leg ended 0–0, which was enough for Turkey to qualify through the away-goals rule. In the first 20 minutes of the second half alone, Sergen set up four clear scoring chances as he produced another man of the match performance.

Turkey opened their Euro 2000 campaign with a controversial 2–1 defeat to Italy. &quot;The Guardian&quot; writer Ian Ross recalled the game.

It was his assist from a nicely flighted free-kick from which Turkey scored. Surprisingly, Sergen then came on as a substitute in their 0–0 draw with Sweden, and he didn&#x27;t feature at all during the 2–0 victory over Belgium. In the quarter-finals, Sergen came on in the final few minutes as Turkey were defeated by Portugal. Sergen heavily criticised Denizli for not starting him in all of the matches, &quot;He&#x27;s got problems, he&#x27;s not all there in the head. Don&#x27;t ask me why I didn&#x27;t play, ask him.&quot;

====2002 World Cup====
Sergen missed most of 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification due to his dismal performances at club level. His transfer to Galatasaray and performances in the UEFA Champions League allowed him back into the team and he featured in the 5–0 thrashing of Austria to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Tragically though Sergen had injured himself prior to the tournament and did not feature.

====Euro 2004====
Sergen again wasn&#x27;t involved in most of the UEFA Euro 2004 qualification campaign, but due to his memorable performance against Chelsea, he was selected for the crucial final qualifying match against England. It was his final match for Turkey, which ended 0–0. Due to injury, he did not feature in the play-off ties against Latvia as Turkey were defeated.

== Managerial Career ==
=== Early career ===
====Managing multiple Turkish clubs====
In October 2008, following the resignation of Beşiktaş’s head coach Ertuğrul Sağlam, Mustafa Denizli was appointed as the new head coach, and Yalçın was initially set to become his assistant. However, due to licensing issues, Yalçın was assigned to coach the under-15 team while completing a six-month internship to upgrade his coaching license. Despite this, he was more involved with the first team’s technical staff.

In August 2009, Yalçın was placed in charge of the Beşiktaş A2 team, which performed strongly in the A2 League. However, he resigned in December 2009, citing head coach Mustafa Denizli’s lack of interest in youth development and reluctance to utilize young players.

During the 2013–14 season, Gaziantepspor struggled in the league, with 2 wins, 2 draws, and 7 losses in the first 11 weeks. After parting ways with Bülent Uygun, the club appointed Yalçın as their manager on 15 November 2013.
Under his management, the team played 15 matches, achieving 8 wins, 3 draws, and 4 losses. On March 29, 2014, Yalçın mutually terminated his contract with the club. When Yalçın left, the team was in 10th place. Despite failing to win after his departure, Gaziantepspor managed to stay in the league.

On 23 December 2014 after Roberto Carlos left Sivasspor, Yalçın agreed to manage the team until the end of the season. In his first 18 matches, the team secured 7 wins, 4 draws, and 7 losses. On 15 May 2015 he extended his contract for another year with an option for further renewal. Sivasspor reached the semi-finals of the 2014–15 Turkish Cup and achieved their goal of avoiding relegation. On 24 October 2015 after a 2–0 defeat against Trabzonspor Yalçın announced he was considering resigning due to poor performance and subsequently mutually terminated his contract. During his tenure in the Süper Lig, Sivasspor played 29 matches under Yalçın, winning 7, drawing 11, and losing 11, scoring 40 goals while conceding 41.

On 11 January 2017, Yalçın was appointed as the manager of Kayserispor. On 22 April 2017, following a 2–1 away defeat to Gençlerbirliği Yalçın resigned from his position. During his time at the club, Yalçın managed 12 league matches, achieving 4 wins, 3 draws, and 5 losses. The team was in 15th place when he departed, following a seven-match unbeaten run and four consecutive defeats.

On 31 July 2017, Yalçın signed a one-year contract with Eskişehirspor, a team competing in the TFF 1. Lig and under a transfer ban. On 25 September 2017, after failing to secure a win in the first five league matches and with the team sitting in 17th place with just 3 points, Yalçın resigned.

On 6 March 2018, Yalçın signed with Konyaspor until the end of the 2017–18 season. Taking over when the team was in the relegation zone, Konyaspor won 4, drew 3, and lost 3 of their last 10 matches, finishing in 15th place and avoiding relegation. On 20 June 2018, Konyaspor announced Yalçın and his staff had parted ways with the club.

In 9 November 2018, Yalçın was appointed as the manager of Alanyaspor. At the end of the 2018–19 season, his contract expired, and he decided not to renew it.

On 13 June 2019, Yalçın signed a one-year contract with Yeni Malatyaspor. On 16 January 2020 his contract was terminated in January 2020 following a loss to Sivasspor. During his six-month tenure, Yalçın oversaw 17 league matches, achieving 6 wins, 6 draws, and 5 losses, with the team finishing the first half of the season in 8th place. In the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, the team recorded 2 wins, 1 draw, and 1 loss.

=== Beşiktaş ===
==== 2019–20 season ====
On 29 January 2020, Yalçın signed a 1.5-year contract with Beşiktaş in a ceremony attended by approximately 20,000 fans at Beşiktaş Stadium. Yalçın expressed his excitement during the signing ceremony, saying: &quot;I have never been this excited in my life. I am immensely grateful to our president, the management, and our fans for giving me this opportunity.&quot;

Yalçın&#x27;s first match in charge was an away fixture against Çaykur Rizespor, where Beşiktaş won 2–1. In his debut season, Beşiktaş played 15 matches under his management, achieving 10 wins, 2 draws, and 3 losses. The team, which had been in 7th place when he took over, finished the league in 3rd place with 62 points, behind Başakşehir and Trabzonspor. Due to Trabzonspor&#x27;s UEFA ban, Beşiktaş qualified for the UEFA Champions League qualifiers.

==== 2020–21 season ====
In the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League second qualifying round, Beşiktaş lost 3–1 away to PAOK. In the UEFA Europa League, they were eliminated in the third qualifying round after losing on penalties to Rio Ave.

Despite a poor start in the league, Yalçın led the team to an impressive recovery, culminating in Beşiktaş winning the 2020-21 Süper Lig title and the 2020–21 Turkish Cup. Beşiktaş became the first team to win both domestic trophies in the same season under Yalçın&#x27;s management.

==== 2021–22 season ====
After extending his contract for another year, leading the team to the league championship, expectations were high for the next season. However, following poor domestic performances and disappointing results in the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League, where the team finished last in their group with zero points, Yalçın decided to resign. The team’s struggles in the Champions League, including six consecutive losses, highlighted the challenges faced during his tenure.

=== Antalyaspor ===
On January 2, 2024, Yalçın signed with Antalyaspor. In his introductory press conference, he stated: &quot;We are thrilled to join Antalyaspor. It&#x27;s been nearly two years since we last worked as a team. We are confident that we made the right decision.&quot; During his tenure, Antalyaspor played 22 matches, securing 7 wins, 6 draws, and 9 losses. At the end of the season, Yalçın announced his departure.

==Personal life==
Yalçın is the first child of Günsel and Özer Yalçın. He grew up with two younger brothers, Gürsoy and Volkan. Sergen discovered his passion for football as a child, playing on the beaches of Kilyos. His father, Özer Yalçın, a former footballer, recognized his talent early and took him to Beşiktaş for tryouts, entrusting him to Serpil Hamdi Tüzün. Despite working at a hotel at the time, Özer supported his son’s training until Sergen became independent as he started secondary school.

Originally from Rize, Yalçın was a footballer who attracted a great deal of attention for his private life as much as his football career. Sergen&#x27;s passion for horse racing often caused problems at the clubs he played for. His teammate Gökhan Keskin shared in an interview: &quot;When he first came to Beşiktaş, they put him with me. He was only 17. They said, &#x27;Look after this boy, he’s into horse racing.&#x27; Two weeks later, I found myself, Metin, and Sergen making horse racing bets together.&quot; At one point, his name came up during the &quot;Barbie Operation,&quot; a prostitution investigation, where he had to testify. He was also investigated due to his gambling addiction and alleged connections with Sedat Peker. On an NTV program, Sergen admitted that Bayern Munich had considered signing him but decided against it after learning about these traits.

<text>Monkey Business is a 1931 American pre-Code comedy film. It is the third of the Marx Brothers&#x27; released movies (Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo), and the first with an original screenplay rather than an adaptation of one of their Broadway shows. The film also features Thelma Todd, Harry Woods and Ruth Hall and Rockliffe Fellowes. It is directed by Norman Z. McLeod with screenplay by S. J. Perelman and Will B. Johnstone.

==Plot==
On board an ocean liner bound for America, four stowaways hide in wooden barrels in the ship&#x27;s cargo hold. After singing &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot;, they are discovered and the ship&#x27;s officers spend the rest of the voyage chasing and attempting to catch the stowaways who are running amok. Chico and Harpo pose as barbers and shave off an officers&#x27; mustache while he is sleeping; Groucho and Chico lock the ship&#x27;s Captain in a closet and eat his lunch; Groucho hides in the closet of the stateroom of gangster Alky Briggs and his wife, Lucille; Briggs leaves and Groucho begins romancing Lucille until he is caught and threatened by Briggs. Briggs is so taken by Groucho&#x27;s nerve, he hires both Groucho and Zeppo to cover him while he confronts Big Joe Helton, a rival mob boss and gives them loaded guns, which they immediately ditch in a bucket of water. Chico and Harpo disrupt a chess game and confiscate the board, taking it into the stateroom of Helton and his daughter Mary. After they scare off Briggs during the confrontation with Helton, the mobster is impressed and hires Chico and Harpo to be his bodyguards. Groucho later offers his own protection services to Helton, who says he will think it over.

After the ship docks in the United States, the stowaways realize they need to steal passports to disembark. Zeppo manages to swipe the passport of movie star Maurice Chevalier, and demonstrates his ability to mimic the Frenchman&#x27;s singing. The four cut in line at customs and Zeppo impersonates Chevalier. He is unsuccessful, however, and Chico, Groucho and Harpo, each attempt unconvincing portrayals of Chevalier singing the same song, with Harpo resorting to strapping a phonograph on his back with an actual record of Chevalier singing. After a man faints, Groucho poses as a doctor and urges the crowd to gather around the unconscious man so he won&#x27;t recover. Sailors remove the man from the ship on a stretcher, but it&#x27;s actually the four stowaways hiding under a blanket.

Helton throws a coming-out party for Mary, whom Zeppo met and romanced onboard the ship. Groucho is reunited with Lucille at the party, where Chico plays piano and Harpo plays harp. Briggs&#x27; men, posing as musicians, kidnap Mary and hold her captive in an old barn. The four stowaways and Helton follow and Zeppo engages in fisticuffs with Alky Briggs, while Groucho delivers ringside commentary. Mary is rescued by Zeppo and Groucho attempts to find a needle in a haystack.

Except in the film&#x27;s credits the Marx Brothers&#x27; characters have no names in this film. They are referred to simply as &quot;the stowaways&quot;.

==Production==

Writers S. J. Perelman and Will B. Johnstone were excited to be working with the Marx Brothers. However, producer Herman J. Mankiewicz advised them to lower their expectations. He called the brothers &quot;mercurial, devious, and ungrateful ... I hate to depress you, but you&#x27;ll rue the day you ever took the assignment. This is an ordeal by fire, make sure you wear asbestos pants.&quot; Of the original script delivered by Perelman and Johnstone, Groucho said, &quot;It stinks.&quot; He considered Perelman too intellectual to write for the Marx Brothers manic comic style. The final script was the result of five months of work by the brothers, gag writers, director Norman Z. MacLeod and Mankiewicz. MacLeod later said that up to 12 writers worked on the film, and that Eddie Cantor contributed when he visited the set during shooting.

Typical for many Marx Brothers films, production censors demanded changes in some lines with sexual innuendo. &quot;Monkey Business&quot; was banned in Ireland because censors feared it would encourage anarchic tendencies. In Ireland, the film was passed on January 8, 1932, with &quot;16 unspecified cuts to script&quot;, including characters falling over each other in a dance scene.

This is the first Marx Brothers film not to feature Margaret Dumont: this time their female foil is comedian Thelma Todd, who would also star in the Marx Brothers&#x27; next film, &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;. In December 1935, Todd was found dead in her car, inside her garage apparently from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. A line of dialogue in &quot;Monkey Business&quot; seems to foreshadow Todd&#x27;s death. Alone with Todd in her cabin, Groucho quips: &quot;You&#x27;re a woman who&#x27;s been getting nothing but dirty breaks. Well, we can clean and tighten your brakes, but you&#x27;ll have to stay in the garage all night.&quot;

Early on in &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, the Brothers—playing stowaways concealed in barrels—harmonize unseen while performing the popular song &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot;. It is a matter of debate whether Harpo joins in with the singing. (One of the ship&#x27;s crew asserts to the captain that he knows there are four stowaways because he can hear them singing &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot;.) If so, it would be one of only a few times Harpo used speech on screen, as opposed to other vocalizations such as whistling or sneezing. At least one other possible on-screen utterance occurs in the film &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937), in which Groucho, Chico, and Harpo are heard singing &quot;Down by the Old Mill Stream&quot; in three-part harmony.

This was the first Marx film to be written specifically for film, and it was the first to be shot in Hollywood. Their first two films were filmed at Paramount Pictures&#x27; Astoria Studios in Queens, New York City.

The Marx Brothers&#x27; real-life father (Sam &quot;Frenchie&quot; Marx) is briefly seen in a cameo appearance, sitting on top of luggage behind the Brothers on the pier as they wave to the First Mate upon alighting. Sam Marx was 72 at the time, and the appearance was his film debut. He was paid $12.50 each day for two days&#x27; work.

&quot;Monkey Business&quot; was Norman MacLeod&#x27;s solo directorial debut.

===Songs===
One of the sequences in this film involves the four brothers attempting to get off the ship using a passport stolen from famous singer (and fellow Paramount star) Maurice Chevalier. Each brother impersonates Chevalier (complete with straw hat) and sings &quot;You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me&quot; (&quot;If the nightingales could sing like you ...&quot;) in turn. This poses a problem for the mute Harpo, who mimes to a hidden phonograph tied to his back which plays the Chevalier recording. When the turntable slows down and he has to rewind it, the ruse is uncovered. Earlier, when Zeppo first meets gangster Joe Helton&#x27;s daughter Mary on the promenade of the ocean liner, &quot;Just One More Chance&quot; by Arthur Johnston and Sam Coslow can be heard playing in the background. Chico performs two pieces on the piano, the &quot;Pizzicato&quot; from &quot;Sylvia&quot; by Léo Delibes, which then morphs into the song &quot;When I Take My Sugar to Tea&quot;, written by Sammy Fain, Irving Kahal, and Pierre Norman. Harpo performs &quot;I&#x27;m Daffy over You&quot; by Sol Violinsky and Chico. The dance band at Mary&#x27;s debut party is playing the song &quot;Ho Hum!&quot; when the Marx Brothers arrive.

==Reception and impact==
&quot;Monkey Business&quot; was a critical and box office success, and it is considered one of the Marx Brothers&#x27; best and funniest films.

Contemporary reviews were positive. Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Whether it is really as funny as &#x27;Animal Crackers&#x27; is a matter of opinion. Suffice it to say that few persons will be able to go to the Rivoli and keep a straight face.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s review began, &quot;The usual Marx madhouse and plenty of laughs sprouting from a plot structure resembling one of those California bungalows which sprout up overnight.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; agreed that the plot was &quot;flimsy&quot;, but also found the film &quot;crammed all the way with laughs and there&#x27;s never a dead spot.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; thought the film was &quot;the best this family has given us.&quot;
The film was evidently based on two routines the Marx Brothers did during their early days in vaudeville (&quot;Home Again&quot; and &quot;Mr. Green&#x27;s Reception&quot;), along with a story idea from one of Groucho&#x27;s friends, Bert Granet, called &quot;The Seas Are Wet&quot;. The passport scene is a reworking of a stage sketch in which the brothers burst into a theatrical agent&#x27;s office auditioning an impersonation of a current big star. It appeared in their stage shows &quot;On the Mezzanine Floor&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Say She Is&quot; (1924). This skit was also done by the Marxes in the Paramount promotional film &quot;The House That Shadows Built&quot; (1931).

The concept of the Marx Brothers being stowaways on a ship was repeated in an episode of their radio series &quot;Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel&quot; (1933), in the episode &quot;The False Roderick&quot;, and was also recycled in their MGM film &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935). The essence of Groucho&#x27;s joke, &quot;Sure, I&#x27;m a doctor—where&#x27;s the horse?&quot; later served as an integral plot element for their film &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937). Also repeated in that later film was the uproarious medical examination that Harpo and Chico give opera singer Madame Swempski (Cecil Cunningham).

==Sequel==
According to Turner Classic Movies&#x27; Robert Osborne, a sequel was planned for this film that would continue the gangster theme. During the development of that film, aviator Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s son was kidnapped and killed by what were believed to be gangsters. The writers quickly shifted gears and instead based the next film, &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;, very loosely on the Marx Brothers&#x27; earlier stage show &quot;Fun in Hi Skule&quot;.

<doc id="1230307" wikidata="Q6123346" url="?curid=1230307" title="Linda Colley">
<text>Dame Linda Jane Colley (born 13 September 1949 in Chester, England) is an expert on British, imperial and global history from 1700. She is Shelby M. C. Davis 1958 Professor of History at Princeton University and a long-term fellow in history at the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in Uppsala. She previously held chairs at Yale University and at the London School of Economics. Her work frequently approaches the past from inter-disciplinary perspectives.

==Personal life==
Colley is married to fellow historian Sir David Cannadine.

==Early life and education==
Linda Colley took her first degree in history at Bristol University before completing a doctorate on the Tory Party in the eighteenth century at the University of Cambridge, supervised by John H. Plumb. She subsequently held a Research Fellowship at Girton College, a joint lectureship in history at Newnham and King&#x27;s Colleges, and in 1979 was appointed the first woman Fellow at Christ&#x27;s College, where she is now an Honorary Fellow.

==Career==

Colley&#x27;s first book, &quot;In Defiance of Oligarchy: The Tory Party 1714-1760&quot; (1982), challenged the then dominant view by arguing that the Tory Party remained active and influential during its years out of power, exploring the consequences of this for the evolution of ideas, popular politics and political action in eighteenth century England and Wales. &quot;Britons: Forging the Nation 1707–1837&quot; (1992), which won the Wolfson History Prize and has passed through five editions, investigated how – and how far – inhabitants of England, Scotland, and Wales came to see themselves as British over the course of the 18th and early 19th centuries.

In March 1993, Colley gave a half-hour &quot;Opinions&quot; lecture televised on Channel 4 and subsequently published in &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;Britain must move with the times to be great again&quot;.

In 1998, Colley accepted a Senior Leverhulme Research Professorship in History at the London School of Economics. She spent the next five years researching the experiences of thousands of Britons taken captive in North America, South Asia, and the Mediterranean and North Africa between 1600 and 1850. &quot;Captives: Britain, Empire and the World 1600-1850&quot; (2002), the result of this work, used captivity narratives of different kinds to investigate the under-belly and sporadic vulnerability of this empire and its makers.

She authored &quot;Namier&quot; (1988), a reappraisal of the Polish-born and Zionist historian Lewis Namier, and &quot;The Ordeal of Elizabeth Marsh: A Woman in World History&quot;. This was named as one of the best books of 2007 by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and was a pioneer of the technique of using the life experiences of an individual to explore trans-national and trans-continental histories. In 2008-99, Colley guest-curated an exhibition at the British Library, London, &quot;Taking Liberties&quot;, on the meanings of constitutional texts in the British past, and published an interpretative essay in connection with this: &quot;Taking Stock of Taking Liberties: A Personal View&quot; (2008).

In 2014, and in advance of the referendum on Scottish independence, she was invited to deliver fifteen talks on BBC Radio 4 on the formation and fractures of the United Kingdom. These were published as &quot;Acts of Union and Disunion&quot; (2014). Her next book &quot;The Gun, the Ship, and the Pen: Warfare, Constitutions, and the Making of the Modern World,&quot; a global history that explores the relationship between warfare, crises and the spread of written constitution, appeared in 2021. Her work has been translated into fifteen languages.

In 1999, Colley was invited to deliver the Prime Minister&#x27;s Millennium Lecture at 10 Downing Street in London. Among other scholarly and public lectures, she has delivered the Trevelyan Lectures at Cambridge University, the Wiles Lectures at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, Ford and Bateman Lectures at Oxford University, the Nehru Memorial Lecture at the London School of Economics, the Lewis Walpole Memorial Lecture at Yale University, the Carnochan Lecture at Stanford University, the President&#x27;s Lecture at Princeton University in 2007, the Sir Douglas Robb Lectures at the University of Auckland in New Zealand in 2015, the Prothero Lecture for the Royal Historical Society in 2020, and the Wittrock Lecture at the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in 2022.

In 1999, Colley was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. She is also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, the Royal Historical Society, and the Academia Europaea. In 2009, she was awarded a CBE for services to history and, in 2022, Colley was made a DBE. She holds seven honorary degrees.

Colley has served on the board of the British Library (1999–2003), the council of Tate Gallery of British Art (1999-2003), the board and trustees of Princeton University Press (2007–2012), the research committee of the British Museum (2012–2020).

She writes occasionally for the &quot;London Guardian&quot;, the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; and the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;.

<doc id="1230308" wikidata="Q192965" url="?curid=1230308" title="Juan Román Riquelme">
<text>Juan Román Riquelme (; born 24 June 1978) is an Argentine former professional footballer and current president of Boca Juniors, the club where he spent the majority of his playing career. He is considered by various journalists, players and coaches as one of the greatest playmakers of all time.

Riquelme played as a midfielder in the classic &quot;enganche&quot; role from 1996 until 2015, beginning his career with Boca Juniors, where he won eleven titles, including, five Primera División titles, three Copa Libertadores and one Intercontinental Cup. In 2002, he transferred to Barcelona of Spain, but his time at the club was short-lived, due to his unsteady relationship with then-head coach, Louis van Gaal. Riquelme was subsequently loaned to and later bought by fellow La Liga club Villarreal, where Riquelme would help the club achieve a third-place league finish in the 2004–05 La Liga and reach the semi-finals of the Champions League for the first time in the club&#x27;s history in the following campaign.

Riquelme returned to Boca Juniors in 2007, initially on loan, where he would once again win the Copa Libertadores, finishing as top scorer and MVP of the competition. His transfer was made permanent soon after, and he would go on to win two more league titles and a Copa Argentina during his final spell with the club. Riquelme announced he would quit Boca in 2012 after losing the final of the Copa Libertadores; after spending most of 2012 and 2013 away from football, he returned to playing under Carlos Bianchi in February 2013, before officially leaving in 2014 after the club president decided not to renew his contract. He would briefly sign with Argentinos Juniors in July 2014 to help achieve the promotion back to first division, before announcing his retirement from the professional game in January 2015.

With the Argentina national team, Riquelme achieved success at youth level, winning the 1997 South American U-20 Championship and the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia. He would earn his first call-up to the senior team in 1997, and went on to appear 57 times between 1997 and 2008, scoring 17 goals and representing Argentina at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. Riquelme also represented his nation in the Olympics, captaining the side to gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics alongside Lionel Messi.

Riquelme was distinguished as Argentina&#x27;s footballer of the year four times and named South American Footballer of the Year in 2001, and was also included in the South American Team of the Year six times. He was among the nominees for the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 2006 and 2007, and the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2005 and 2007.

==Club career==

===Early years===
Riquelme was born as the eldest of eleven children in a poor family, one day before Argentina won the 1978 World Cup. He began playing football in the localities of San Fernando, playing for different local clubs, before gaining the opportunity to trial with the junior teams of Argentinos Juniors. After trialling, he was signed by the club where he began playing as a central midfielder. Boca Juniors and River Plate spotted him when he was a youth player for Argentinos Juniors. In 1996, however, Riquelme was transferred from Argentinos Juniors U-20 to Boca Juniors U-20 for a fee of US$800,000, during an operation insisted by trainer Carlos Salvador Bilardo which led to the then president of Boca Juniors, Mauricio Macri, establishing various purchases of Argentinos Juniors youth players.

=== Boca Juniors (1996–01) ===
On 10 November 1996, aged 18, Riquelme made his Primera División debut in a 2–0 win against Unión de Santa Fe. Two weeks later, he scored his first senior goal in a 6–0 triumph over Huracán. After making his debut, Riquelme began a long journey to break a streak of no championships for the team since winning the Apertura 1992. In the 1996–97 season, Bilardo would be fired and replaced by Héctor &quot;Bambino&quot; Veira, but after Diego Maradona&#x27;s second return to Boca, Román would be relegated from the first team. After almost obtaining the championship in the 1997–98 season, by July 1998 Veira would be replaced by coach Carlos Bianchi, who would fully trust Riquelme to command the team.

Forming a successful trio in attack with winger Guillermo Barros Schelotto and center forward Martín Palermo, Boca would once again win a title after eight years, by becoming the 1998 Apertura champions undefeated. This would also earn the team a qualification for the 2000 edition of the Copa Libertadores, where Boca would make his return after six years. The season would be highly successful, with the team winning the 1999 Clausura and reaching a historic 40-game undefeated mark. Riquelme entered the South American Team of the Year for the first time, totaling 47 games played and 10 goals scored.

In the 1999–00 season, Boca became champion of America once again after beating Palmeiras in a penalty-shootout. Riquelme had an excellent performance during the competition, highlighting his match against rivals River Plate for the second leg of the quarterfinals, where he scored a goal, assisted in another, and made a historic play where he nutmegged from his behind to the River defender Mario Yepes. Boca&#x27;s successes would continue in the 2000–01 season, winning the Apertura 2000. However, the highest point would be the final of the Intercontinental Cup against Real Madrid, who at that time was in the process of forming &quot;Los Galácticos&quot;, with the signing of the Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Luis Figo. Against all odds, Boca ended up winning the match, and Riquelme would be one of the stars assisting for Martín Palermo&#x27;s second goal with a 30-meter ball, and controlling the pace of play in the last minutes, to which Madrid&#x27;s defenders Claude Makélélé and Geremi couldn&#x27;t hold back. During 2001, Boca would not obtain any local title, but would win again in the Copa Libertadores, defeating Mexican Cruz Azul in the finals again through penalties. This time Román would have an outstanding performance against Palmeiras in the semifinal series, where the Argentine midfielder managed to give an assist in the first leg and score a goal in the second leg. Riquelme would be chosen the MVP of the tournament, and would also win the South American Footballer of the Year award for the first time in his career. As the champions of Copa Libertadores his side faced 2001 UEFA Champions League winners Bayern Munich in the Intercontinental Cup final which ended in a 0–1 defeat for his club.

The closing of the 2001–02 season, Riquelme&#x27;s last in Boca, would not be as successful as the previous ones, the main cause being the departure of Carlos Bianchi in the summer of 2001, due to his differences with the president of the club Mauricio Macri. Riquelme would also have his differences with him due to the poor pay of his contract, to which Riquelme would demonstrate in a match against River Plate for the 2001 Clausura where he celebrated in front of the president&#x27;s box, putting his hands to his ear in protest.

=== Barcelona (2002–03) ===
In July 2002, after seven successful seasons with Boca Juniors which brought him and the club six major titles, including the Intercontinental Cup and the Copa Libertadores in 2000, Riquelme transferred to Barcelona in Spain for a reported €11 million transfer fee. Shortly before his departure, his brother, Cristian, was kidnapped; Riquelme negotiated for his brother&#x27;s release and eventually paid the ransom, later stating this was one of the reasons why he chose to leave Boca.

Barça manager Louis van Gaal described Riquelme as a &quot;political signing&quot; and treated him with indifference. When the Dutchman did play him, he did so rarely, deploying him as a winger. Thus, the player was unable to find his form during a period of largely substitute appearances, losing his place in the first team. He played mainly – as a starter – in the Copa del Rey, and netted the game&#x27;s only goal in a rare UEFA Champions League starting opportunity, at Club Brugge in the group stage. Barcelona&#x27;s season would be critical in every way, with Van Gaal being fired mid-season. This did not change the situation for the better, and Riquelme would continue to appear mainly as a substitute.

=== Villarreal (2003–06) ===

When Barcelona signed Ronaldinho, the club exceeded the maximum foreign players that Spanish teams were allowed, prompting Riquelme&#x27;s two-year loan move to Villarreal. There, he played alongside three compatriots: Rodolfo Arruabarrena, Gonzalo Rodríguez and Juan Pablo Sorín.

At the end of the 2004–05 season, Spanish sports newspaper &quot;Marca&quot; awarded Riquelme with the title of Most Artistic Player, also earning himself a nomination for the 2005 FIFA World Player of the Year award after scoring a career-best 15 goals in 35 games. The Valencian club finished the season in its best-ever position in third place, and in an effort to keep hold of him, bought up 75% of his rights from Barcelona for up to €8 million, depending on Villarreal performance in the next two seasons. Villarreal also gave Riquelme a four-year contract extension, with the caveat that 25% of any subsequent transfer fee would be provided to &quot;Barça&quot; should Villarreal sell him.

A peculiar contract situation arose when, on 7 December 2005, Villarreal beat French club Lille 1–0 to win its Champions League group, knocking out English giants Manchester United and advancing to the knockout stages in the club&#x27;s debut season in the main continental competition. Because of a clause in the transfer contract with Barcelona, Villarreal had to pay €1 million to the Catalan club. Additionally, the contract included two other &quot;€1 million clauses&quot;: One if Villarreal finished in one of the top four league positions in 2005–06, and an identical clause for the following season.

On 25 April 2006, as Villarreal reached the last-four in the Champions League, in the second leg against Arsenal, Jens Lehmann saved a Riquelme penalty that would have taken the match to extra time. The game ended 0–0 at El Madrigal.

Riquelme scored his first goal of the 2006–07 season in a 3–2 home victory against Real Zaragoza on 24 September 2006. He scored a penalty in the 79th minute to give Villarreal their third goal of the match. Riquelme went on to make just 13 league appearances during the first half of the 2006–07 La Liga and played no part in the 2006–07 Copa del Rey.

=== Return to Boca Juniors (2007–14) ===

====2007 loan====
Following a tense situation between players, the Villarreal board of directors and manager Manuel Pellegrini, Riquelme accepted a five-month loan back to Boca Juniors from February 2007 until 30 June 2007. He joined Boca for the 2007 Torneo Clausura of the 2007–08 Argentine Primera División season, debuting during the 2007 Torneo Clausura in a 1–1 home draw against Rosario Central on 17 February 2007. He scored his first goal for Boca – in his newest stint – in a 1–1 home draw against Independiente on 9 March 2007. He scored in the 54th minute to level the scores. His first goal of the 2007 Copa Libertadores came in Boca&#x27;s third group-stage match against Mexico&#x27;s Toluca on 22 March 2007. Riquelme scored in the 23rd minute, Boca&#x27;s second goal of the match in an eventual 3–0 home victory. Boca finished in second position of their respective group with ten points, advancing to the knockout stages of the competition.

During the knockout stages of the competition, Boca faced Vélez Sarsfield in the round of 16 fixtures. During the first leg on 2 May 2007, Riquelme scored in the first minute as Boca claimed a 3–0 home victory. Having progressed to the quarter-finals, Boca Juniors faced Paraguayan side Club Libertad. During the second-leg of the quarter-finals, played on 24 May 2007, Riquelme scored Boca&#x27;s first goal in the 61st minute of the match as they claimed a 2–0 away victory and a 3–1 aggregate result, ensuring progression to the semi-finals. During Boca&#x27;s second-leg semi-final fixture against Colombia&#x27;s Cúcuta Deportivo on 7 June 2007, Riquelme scored a 44th-minute free kick, scoring Boca&#x27;s first goal of their 3–0 home victory. After winning 4–3 on aggregate, Boca advanced to the 2007 Copa Libertadores Final, where they would face Brazilian side Grêmio in June 2007.

During the first leg on 13 June, Riquelme, via a free-kick, played striker Martín Palermo who passed the ball across the face of goal for Rodrigo Palacio to score in the 18th minute. During the second half, Riquelme scored the 2–0 goal in 73rd-minute through a free-kick, with Boca eventually winning 3–0 at home. In the second leg, played away on 20 June, Riquelme scored a second-half double to give Boca Juniors a 2–0 victory and their sixth Copa Libertadores title. Boca Juniors therefore qualified for the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup, and Riquelme was awarded as the competition&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

====2007–08 season====
In August 2007, it was reported that Boca had given up hope of re-signing Riquelme. A few days later, however, the situation changed, with Boca director Juan Carlos Crespi expressing confidence in the player&#x27;s return &quot;within 10 days&quot;. The negotiations stalled when Villarreal&#x27;s counteroffered to sell Riquelme only in exchange for €4 million, Rodrigo Palacio and half the rights to either Mauro Boselli or Jonathan Maidana, terms which were rejected by Boca. On 30 August 2007, however, it was announced Riquelme had been signed by Atlético Madrid for a fee of €8 million, though the deal fell through at the last minute, leaving Riquelme a Villarreal player. He was given the number 16 shirt for the 2007–08 season. Then, on 26 November 2007, Riquelme reached an agreement with Villarreal to allow his re-joining Boca Juniors when the next transfer window re-opened, in January 2008.

Boca opted to pay Villarreal US$15 million to purchase Riquelme, while Villarreal would pay Riquelme&#x27;s salary on behalf of Boca Juniors for remainder of the 2007–08 playing season, which was approximately €3 million. The deal was the most expensive fee paid to an Argentine for its respective player in history. Riquelme subsequently signed a contract lasting from the end of 2007 to 2010. He was unable to participate in the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup as he was not registered by FIFA in time to be able to compete at the tournament.

During the entire 2007–08 Argentine Primera División season, Riquelme would only go on to make ten league appearances and score one league goal. His first match of 2007–08 came in a 1–1 draw against Rosario Central during the 2008 Torneo Clausura. On 4 May 2008, he assisted Sebastián Battaglia in scoring Boca&#x27;s only goal in their 1–0 home victory in the &quot;Superclásico&quot; with River Plate. Riquelme had taken a corner which was played to Battaglia, who headed the ball into the net in the 14th minute. During Boca&#x27;s last 2008 Copa Libertadores group-stage fixture against Maracaibo on 22 April 2008, Riquelme assisted defender Gabriel Paletta in scoring Boca&#x27;s first goal when his free-kick was played towards Paletta, who headed the ball into the net in the tenth minute. Riquelme then scored Boca&#x27;s third goal in the 74th minute with a close-ranged chip as Boca claimed a 3–0 home victory and finished in second position of their respective group, qualifying for the knockout stages of the competition.

During the first-leg of the round of 16 stage on 30 April 2008, Riquelme side footed the ball into the net in the sixth minute after receiving a pass from Álvaro González. Boca went on to win the match 2–1 and eventually claimed a 4–2 aggregate win. The club then faced Fluminense in the semi-final stages. In the first leg on 28 May 2008, Riquelme scored in the 12th minute of the match to give Boca a 1–0 lead after receiving a pass from Rodrigo Palacio, who played the ball across goal for Riquelme to convert. In the 65th minute, Riquelme scored from a free-kick which gave Boca a 2–1 lead before Fluminense again equalized. The second leg saw Fluminense defeat Boca Juniors 3–1, eliminating the Argentine side 5–3 on aggregate. Riquelme had scored four goals in the competition.

====2008–09 season====
In October 2008, Boca Juniors centre-back Julio César Cáceres had a very public conflict with his teammate Riquelme, when during an interview on a Paraguayan radio station in Asunción, during his training with his national team, Cáceres questioned Riquelme&#x27;s motivation. He claimed: &quot;In some matches, he is apparently running and in others he is passive. He seems to be mentally saturated. He seems to have more motivation when he plays for his country.&quot; Riquelme responded by saying, in a telephone interview on the Fox Sports cable channel: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t know what I feel for the club. I take part in pre-match concentration just like the other players and I didn&#x27;t have a holiday because I chose to play in the Olympics. When we won the gold, I ran to the airport so I could play in the (Recopa Sudamericana 2008) final.&quot; He added: &quot;These things should be kept in the dressing-room, he&#x27;s broken all the codes of football.&quot; After Boca won the &quot;Superclásico&quot; derby match over Buenos Aires rivals River Plate on 21 October 2008, Cáceres said that the conflict &quot;has been left behind&quot;, adding that the relationship between the two players had improved.

During the second leg of the 2008 Recopa Sudamericana, Riquelme scored a 91st minute free-kick to equalize the scores for Boca Juniors at 2–2 against Arsenal de Sarandí on 27 August 2008. Boca Juniors won the tie 5–3 on aggregate.

====2009–10 season====

On 12 April 2010, Riquelme scored Boca&#x27;s third goal in the 47th minute of their 4–0 home victory against Arsenal de Sarandí.

====2011–12 season====
Riquelme&#x27;s first appearance in the 2011–12 Argentine Primera División season came during the 2011 Torneo Apertura in a 1–1 home draw against Banfield on 12 June 2011. He scored his first goal of the 2011 Torneo Apertura in a 4–0 home victory against Unión de Santa Fé on 15 August; his was Boca&#x27;s third goal, coming in the 83rd minute. Boca finished in first place of the 2011 Torneo Clausura with 43 points, going undefeated in 19 league games. They had claimed the title for the first time in four years, securing qualification to the 2012 Copa Libertadores.

Riquelme&#x27;s first appearances in the 2011–12 Copa Argentina came in a 1–1 draw against Deportivo Santamarina on 2 February 2012. He assisted Facundo Roncaglia in scoring Boca&#x27;s equalizing goal of the match when he lobbed a free kick to Roncaglia, who headed the ball into the net in the 63rd minute. The match was decided via penalty shoot-out which Boca won 4–3. Riquelme&#x27;s first appearance of the 2012 Torneo Clausura came in a 2–0 home victory against Olimpo de Bahía Blanca on 10 February 2012, when he was substituted off of the field in the 79th minute for Cristian Chávez. Four days later, he debuted in the 2012 Copa Libertadores in a 0–0 away draw against Venezuelan side Zamora on 14 February. Riquelme scored his first goal of the 2012 Torneo Clausura in a 2–0 home victory against Newell&#x27;s Old Boys on 26 February; it was Boca&#x27;s second goal, coming in the 80th minute.

Two weeks later, Riquelme scored Boca&#x27;s second goal in their 5–4 home defeat against Independiente on 11 March. Another two weeks later, Riquelme scored Boca&#x27;s second goal in their 2–2 home draw against Lanús on 25 March. He scored in the 41st minute of the match to give Boca a 2–0 lead before the latter scored two second half goals to equalize. In Boca&#x27;s last Copa Libertadores group-stage match, against Zamora on 18 April, Riquelme scored Boca&#x27;s second goal in the 75th minute of their 2–0 home victory. The win earned them a second-place finish in their respective group with 13 points, advancing the side to the knockout stages of the competition.

Here, Boca were drawn against Chilean club Unión Española at the round of 16 stage. During the first leg on 2 May, Riquelme scored Boca&#x27;s first goal of the match in the 25th minute, which gave them a 1–0 lead. In the 90th minute of the match, Riquelme assisted Boca in scoring their second goal of the match when he passed the ball towards the left hand side of the goal into the path of Pablo Mouche, who crossed the ball across the face of goal for Santiago Silva to head home the winner in the eventual 2–1 home victory. During the second leg, on 9 May, Riquelme assisted Boca in scoring their first goal of the match when he played a free-kick to Juan Insaurralde, who scored in the 26th minute. During the second half, Riquelme dribbled past the Unión Española defenders and played the ball to Pablo Mouchem who scored Boca&#x27;s second goal in the 50th minute. Riquelme then scored Boca&#x27;s third goal in the 68th minute as Boca won the away match, 3–2. 

During the quarter-final stages of the Copa Libertadores, Boca were drawn against Fluminense. During the first leg in Buenos Aires on 17 May, Riquelme assisted Boca in scoring the only goal of the match when he played a ball through to Darío Cvitanich, who set up Pablo Mouche to score in the 51st minute of the 1–0 victory. Boca drew 1–1 in the second leg on 23 May, earning a 2–1 aggregate score and a spot in the semi-finals. On 3 June 2012, Boca faced Primera B Nacional second division club Deportivo Merlo in the semi-finals of the Copa Argentina. In the 57th minute of the match, Riquelme, initially taking a free-kick in front of goal, played a quick one-two with a teammate and curled the ball into the left side of the net, giving them a 1–0. Boca held on to the 1–0 lead until the 89th minute when Deportivo Merlo equalized. The match was eventually decided via penalty shoot-out which Boca won 5–4.

After Boca Juniors had eliminated Chilean club Universidad de Chile in the semi-finals of the Copa Libertadores, Boca faced Corinthians in the two-legged final. Riquelme participated in both matches of the 3–1 aggregate defeat, immediately announcing his retirement from the club after the 2–0 second-leg away defeat in São Paulo on 4 July. Riquelme, who at the time was 34 years old, stated that he would be leaving the club as a result of not have enough energy left to continue. Riquelme admitted he would quit Boca as he had nothing more left to give because he was exhausted, and also signalled that he needed a break from football. Without the presence of Riquelme, Boca went on to win the 2011–12 Copa Argentina when they defeated Racing Club in a 2–1 victory on 8 August.

====2012–13 transfer speculation====
On 18 October 2012, it was reported that Riquelme&#x27;s agent, Daniel Bolotnicoff, had denied reports that any Australian A-League club had contacted him to show an interest in signing Riquelme, as he had been linked with Melbourne Heart and Western Sydney Wanderers. On 5 January 2013, it was reported that Riquelme nearly joined Major League Soccer (MLS) side Chivas USA when he was to follow former coach Carlos Bianchi in a trip to the United States, as the latter was going to be head coach of the MLS club. Bianchi was then announced as Boca&#x27;s first-team coach ten days later, which led to Riquelme&#x27;s reiteration that he would not re-join Boca Juniors as a player.

In January 2013, after much speculation that Riquelme was headed to join Palmeiras, it was announced by newly appointed club president Paulo Nobre that Palmeiras had to refrain from signing Riquelme due to financial terms and Riquelme&#x27;s asking salary.

On 26 January 2013, Riquelme confessed that he did not miss playing football and that his last options would be to play for Argentinos Juniors or Tigre. On 30 January 2013, it was officially reported that Argentinos Juniors president Luis Seguira had announced that the club would make an offer for Riquelme. On 31 January 2013, it was then reported that Riquelme had visited Tigre&#x27;s intendent, Sergio Massa, in order to discuss the possibility of his arrival at the club. On 3 February 2013, it was reported that, after various negotiations, Riquelme had accepted the offer to play for Tigre, and that the discussion and confirmation of his contract was the only thing which remained to be done until his official signing with the club.

On 4 February 2013, it was reported that Riquelme had stated that he was prepared to return to Boca Juniors, and that he had contacted Boca coach Carlos Bianchi that he would be available to return.

====2013–14 season====
It was confirmed on 8 February 2013 that Riquelme would return to Boca Juniors. He was extremely decisive at the second match against Corinthians at the Copa Libertadores, scoring a goal from the midfield and knocking off the reigning FIFA Club World Cup champions.

On 30 March 2014, Riquelme scored a free kick in the &quot;Superclásico&quot;, but could not stop his team from losing 2–1 against River Plate.

===Argentinos Juniors (2014)===
On 17 July 2014, it was confirmed that Riquelme would sign with Argentinos Juniors. He scored his first goal with his new club on his first game against Boca Unidos.

===Retirement===
On 23 January 2015, it was reported that Riquelme would travel to Asunción on Saturday 24 January to close the contract offer from Primera División Paraguaya club Cerro Porteño, which would be worth US$110,000 per month, a salary which Riquelme had asked to receive. It was later confirmed that Riquelme&#x27;s salary would make his contract the most expensive in the country. On 25 January 2015, however, Riquelme officially announced his retirement from football via ESPN and ultimately gave thanks to Cerro Porteño. Riquelme&#x27;s farewell took place eight years later, on June 25 in Buenos Aires, as Boca Juniors faced the Argentina national team at the Bombonera stadium. Lionel Messi captained the Argentina XI, joined by Angel Di Maria, Leandro Paredes and Lionel Scaloni in this memorable event. While Messi managed to score, the outcome favored Boca with a score of 5–3.

==International career==
In 1997, after a successful stint with Argentina&#x27;s under-20 team, Riquelme was called up to the Argentina national team by coach Daniel Passarella for their last qualifying match for the 1998 World Cup on 16 November 1997. The match was played at the stadium of Boca Juniors, La Bombonera, where a 19-year-old Riquelme debuted for Argentina when he entered the field in the last minutes of the 1–1 draw against Colombia. His first major tournament for Argentina was at the 1999 Copa América.

In 2000, Riquelme participated at the 2000 CONMEBOL Men Pre-Olympic Tournament, which saw Argentina fail to qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics. He appeared three times and scored one goal during the competition. Riquelme scored his first international goal in a 3–1 away victory during a friendly against Libya in Tripoli on 30 April 2003. On 17 November 2004, Riquelme scored his second international goal for Argentina during a 3–2 home victory in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Venezuela. Before departing for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, Riquelme scored in Argentina&#x27;s 3–1 home victory against Brazil on 8 June, during their 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifier in Buenos Aires. On 9 October 2005, Riquelme scored his seventh international goal in a 2–0 home victory against Peru during a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match. Riquelme scored a penalty in the 81st minute. Riquelme&#x27;s eighth international goal came in a 1–0 victory over Qatar in a friendly match in Doha on 16 November 2005.

In 2006, Riquelme was named captain of the Argentina national football team by new coach Alfio Basile. After a 3–0 defeat again in Brazil, Riquelme had received a lot of criticism and responsibility for the defeat. Riquelme&#x27;s mother had been hospitalized twice in two months after the 2006 World Cup, and this led to Riquelme publicly announcing his international retirement from the Argentina national team on 13 September 2006. At that point, Riquelme had made 37 international appearances and had scored eight goals. On 13 October 2007, Riquelme emerged from three months of inactivity at Villarreal to score two free-kicks in a 2–0 win against Chile to get Argentina off to a winning start in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. On 17 November, Riquelme again netted twice in Argentina&#x27;s 3–0 home victory against Bolivia, again during a 2010 World Cup qualifier match. This brought him to a total of 17 international goals. In March 2009, Riquelme decided to retire from the national team after a disagreement with coach Diego Maradona. Former manager Sergio Batista stated he would have liked for Riquelme to return to international play, hinting at the possibility of the player appearing in a friendly with Spain in August 2010, which eventually did not happen.

In 2011, Riquelme was called up to the Argentina national team by coach Alejandro Sabella for the Superclásico de las Américas, however he eventually withdrew his position from the squad due to injuries from club matches which would leave him unable to complete two games in a matter of days.

===Youth===

====1997 South American Youth Championship====
Under coach José Pekerman, Riquelme was called up to the Argentina national under-20 football team for the 1997 South American Youth Championship held in Chile. He played in all 9 matches of the tournament and scored three goals. Argentina went on to win the tournament, gaining their second South American Youth Championship in thirty years. Riquelme, alongside Walter Samuel and Pablo Aimar, were selected in the team of the tournament, by a group of journalists who were registered at the tournament. Argentina&#x27;s win secured their qualification for the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia.

====1997 FIFA World Youth Championship====
Riquleme was selected as captain of Argentina for the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship and played in all three group stage matches. He scored Argentina&#x27;s third goal in the 50th minute of their 3–0 victory against Hungary on 18 June 1997. He then scored a 55th-minute winner in Argentina&#x27;s 2–1 win against Canada on 20 June 1997. In Argentina&#x27;s final group stage match, against Australia, Riquelme scored an 88th-minute penalty to level the scores at 3–3 before Australia scored a 90th-minute penalty to win the game. Argentina had gained six points and finished in second in their group, advancing to the stage of the tournament. On 26 June 1997, Argentina faced England in the round of 16, where Riquelme scored a tenth-minute penalty as Argentina claimed a 2–1 victory. Argentina went on to defeat Brazil 2–0 in the quarter-final, the Republic of Ireland 1–0 in the semi-final, and came from behind to beat Uruguay 2–1 in the final, claiming their third FIFA World Youth Championship. Riquelme had scored four goals for the tournament and Argentina were awarded with the FIFA Fair Play Award.

====1998 Toulon Tournament====
In May 1998, José Pékerman again included Riquelme in Argentina&#x27;s under-20 squad for the 1998 Toulon Tournament, held in France. Argentina triumphed 2–0 against France in the final as Riquelme played all five matches of the tournament and was named as Player of the Tournament.

===Senior===

====1999 Copa América====
Riquelme was included in Argentina&#x27;s 22-man squad for the 1999 Copa América in Paraguay, wearing the number 22 shirt. He was one of six Boca Juniors players selected in the squad. He played in Argentina&#x27;s opening group stage match, a 3–1 victory against Ecuador on 1 July 1999. He was replaced in the 90th minute for Diego Cagna. in Argentina&#x27;s second group stage fixture, on 4 July 1999, Riquelme played the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 loss against Colombia. On 7 July 1999, he again played the full 90 minutes in Argentina&#x27;s third group stage match, a 2–0 victory over Uruguay. Argentina finished in second place of their respective group with six points, facing Brazil in the quarter-finals on 11 July 1999. Riquelme played in the entire match of Argentina&#x27;s 2–1 defeat, having been in front 1–0 until the 32nd minute of the match.

====2005 FIFA Confederations Cup====

Under former national youth team coach José Pékerman, Riquelme was selected for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in June, where he wore the number 8 shirt. He played in Argentina&#x27;s opening group stage match against Tunisia on 15 June, opening the scoring for Argentina by converting a penalty in the 33rd minute as Argentina eventually claimed a 2–1 victory. On 18 June, Argentina faced Australia in the second group stage match. Already winning 1–0, Riquelme scored a 31st-minute penalty to give Argentina a 2–0 lead as they went on to win 4–2. In Argentina&#x27;s third group stage match, against hosts Germany on 21 June, Riquelme scored a 33rd-minute equaliser for Argentina just four minutes after Germany had taken the lead. The match finished at 2–2 as Argentina had claimed seven points, along with Germany, and progressed to the next round of the tournament.

On 26 June, Argentina faced Mexico in the semi-final. After extra time, the match was tied at 1–1 and led to a penalty shoot-out. Riquelme converted Argentina&#x27;s first spot kick as they won 6–5 on penalties, with Argentina successfully converting each penalty. On 29 June, Argentina faced Brazil in the final. Riquelme played the full 90 minutes as Argentina were defeated 4–1 at the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt. Riquelme was awarded as the Silver Ball Winner, being the second best player at the tournament.

====2006 FIFA World Cup====
Again under coach José Pékerman, Riquelme was included in the Argentina 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup, where he was given the number 10 shirt for the first time in history. Argentina were drawn against Netherlands, Serbia and Montenegro and the Ivory Coast in what was regarded as the tournament&#x27;s &quot;group of death&quot;. On 10 June, he started in Argentina&#x27;s opening group stage match against the Ivory Coast. Argentina had been leading 1–0 before Riquelme assisted Javier Saviola in scoring Argentina&#x27;s second goal in their 2–1 victory. Riquelme was then substituted off of the field for Pablo Aimar in the 93rd minute. On 16 June, Argentina faced Serbia and Montenegro in Gelsenkirchen, where Riquelme played the full 90 minutes of an eventual 6–0 victory for Argentina. Riquelme was the key in a sequence of 24 passes made by the Argentine team, setting up their second goal scored by Esteban Cambiasso when he fed Saviola, who slipped a pass inside for Cambiasso; Cambiasso then knocked the ball to Hernán Crespo, who back-heeled a return pass back to Cambiasso, who then netted from 12 yards. Crespo described the movement as &quot;the most beautiful goal&quot;. Riquelme also assisted Argentina in scoring their fourth goal, quickly taking a free-kick which was played to Lionel Messi, who crossed the ball in for Crespo to score at the far post. Riquelme was awarded as the Man of the Match.

On 21 June, Argentina drew 0–0 with the Netherlands in Frankfurt in the last group-stage fixture. Riquelme was substituted off in the 80th minute for Pablo Aimar as Argentina finished in first place of their group, along with the Netherlands, with seven points. On 24 June, Riquelme celebrated his 28th birthday as Argentina faced Mexico in the round of 16. After Mexico had taken a sixth-minute lead through Rafael Márquez, Riquelme had taken a corner-kick in the tenth minute which saw Hernán Crespo flick the ball into the net. The match stayed level until extra time when Maxi Rodríguez scored in the 98th minute to send Argentina through to the quarter-finals. Argentina faced hosts Germany in the quarter-finals on 30 June. In the 49th minute, Riquelme delivered in a corner pin-pointing Roberto Ayala, who headered the ball into the net, giving Argentina a 1–0 lead. Riquelme was then replaced in the 72nd minute by substitute Esteban Cambiasso. Moments later, Germany had equalized in the 80th minute through Miroslav Klose. The match was decided via a penalty shoot-out, which Germany won 4–2.

====2007 Copa América====

On 26 June 2007, Riquelme was recalled to the national team by coach Alfio Basile as part of Argentina&#x27;s 23-man squad for 2007 Copa América. During the early morning after Boca Juniors had claimed the 2007 Copa Libertadores, Riquelme hurriedly returned to Buenos Aires and departed with the Argentina national team to Venezuela for the tournament. On 28 June, Riquelme featured in Argentina&#x27;s opening group stage match, a 4–1 victory against the United States. On 2 July, Argentina faced Colombia in their second group stage match. Riquelme netted twice, with a header in the 34th minute and then with a free-kick in the 45th minute, as Argentina won the match, 4–2.

Argentina went on to win their final group stage match against Paraguay on 5 July, finishing in first place in their group with nine points. On 8 July, Argentina faced Peru in the quarter-finals, where Riquelme scored another two goals, one with each foot in the 47th and 85th minute, and also assisted Messi in scoring in the 61st minute of the match. In the semi-final on 11 July, Argentina defeated Mexico, 3–0, as Riquelme assisted Gabriel Heinze in scoring Argentina&#x27;s first goal of the match in the 45th minute, and also scored his fifth goal of the tournament – Argentina&#x27;s third of the match – when he converted a penalty in the 65th minute. On 15 July, Argentina faced Brazil in the final. Riquelme played the full 90 minutes of the match as Argentina were defeated, 3–0. Riquelme had scored five goals and was awarded as the tournament&#x27;s second-leading goalscorer.

====2008 Summer Olympics====

In August 2008, Riquelme was included as an overage player, and also named captain, by Sergio Batista for Argentina&#x27;s 19-man squad for the 2008 Summer Olympics football tournament in Beijing. He had joined Javier Mascherano and Nicolás Pareja as the three over-aged players in the squad. Argentina were drawn in Group A against the Ivory Coast, Australia and Serbia. On 7 August, Riquelme played the full 90 minutes of Argentina&#x27;s opening group stage fixture as they defeated Ivory Coast 2–1. Three days later, Riquelme also played another 90 minutes in Argentina&#x27;s 1–0 victory against Australia on 10 August. Riquelme then rested on the bench in Argentina&#x27;s third group-stage fixture, giving the captain&#x27;s armband to Javier Mascherano, where they defeated Serbia 2–0 on 13 August to claim maximum points in the group and to finish in first place.

On 16 August, Riquelme featured in Argentina&#x27;s 2–1 quarter-final victory against the Netherlands, advancing to the semi-finals. On 19 August, Argentina faced Brazil in the semi-finals, when after two Sergio Agüero goals, Riquelme scored a 76th-minute penalty to give Argentina a 3–0 victory. On 23 August, Argentina faced Nigeria in the final in front of 89,102 spectators at the Beijing National Stadium, where Argentina defeated Nigeria 1–0 to claim its second consecutive gold medal at the Summer Olympics.

==Style of play==
Considered one of the best playmakers in the world in his prime, as well as one of the most talented Argentine players of his generation, Riquelme was a &quot;classic number ten&quot;, who was best known for his grace, flair, and elegance on the pitch, as well as his creative and intelligent passing. A tall and slender offensive midfield playmaker, he combined outstanding passing range, vision, anticipation, technique, close control, and dribbling skills with prolific goalscoring ability from midfield. A selfless team player, he usually played in a free central role, operating as an attacking midfielder behind the strikers (known as the &quot;enganche&quot; in Argentina), but was also capable of playing in a more withdrawn position as a deep-lying playmaker, due to his ability to dictate the tempo of his team&#x27;s play in midfield, orchestrate attacking moves, and create space and chances for teammates. He has been recognised as one of the &quot;last true number 10s&quot; due to his playmaking abilities and unique playing style. During his time under Van Gaal at Barcelona, Riquelme was also occasionally deployed out of position as a right winger. His skill and creative style of play drew comparisons with Diego Maradona, in his youth, even though, unlike Maradona, Riquelme was neither quick nor a particularly energetic dribbler. A tactically astute player, he also possessed good decision-making, and a good understanding of the game. Moreover, he was an excellent free kick taker. Despite his talent, however, Riquelme was notorious for his lack of pace, for being inconsistent, and for having an introverted yet difficult character, as well as for his poor work-rate, both on the pitch and in training, which led him to have disagreements with several of his managers.

==Second Vice-President==
On 8 December 2019, the formula headed by Jorge Amor Ameal, Mario Pergolini and Juan Román Riquelme was chosen with 52.84% of the votes, achieving the historical record in Argentine football of 20,045 votes in total. They took office on 13 December 2019.

On Saturday, 7 March 2020 (85 days after taking office), he obtained his first title as Second Vice-. Boca Juniors wins the 2019–20 Superliga beating the River Plate led by Marcelo Gallardo in the final stretch.

In 2023, Riquelme and Ameal ran on a ticket against incumbent Andrés Ibarra for the overall club presidency. Riquelme&#x27;s slate won with just under 65% of the vote, in an election which saw more than 43,000 members — roughly 46% of Boca&#x27;s enrolled membership — cast a ballot.

==Personal life==
Riquelme&#x27;s brother, Sebastián, is a current professional footballer.

<text>Matt Reis ( ; born March 28, 1975) is an American former soccer player and coach who played as a goalkeeper. A long-time Major League Soccer mainstay, he has served as goalkeeper coach for LA Galaxy and the United States.

==Youth and college==
Reid was born in Atlanta and raised in Southern California. He played college soccer at UCLA. He finished his college career with an NCAA Championship in 1997, and was named 1997 NCAA College Cup Defensive MVP after recording 20 saves - including a school-record 11 in the semifinals - and posting 221 shutout minutes on the way to the title.

==Career==
===Professional===
Reis was selected by the Los Angeles Galaxy in the third round of the 1998 MLS College Draft. However, with Kevin Hartman firmly entrenched in the nets, Reis did not see much playing time during his five seasons in LA; the most games he played in a season was 16 in 2001 when Hartman was out with injuries. In 2000, the Galaxy sent him on loan to the Orange County Waves for seven games.

Reis was traded to New England Revolution in January 2003 in exchange for Alex Pineda Chacón and a second-round pick in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft.
With the Revs, Reis started out as a backup to Adin Brown, but won the starting job midway through the 2004 season. He became the first goalie in MLS history to stop two penalty kicks in one playoff game, doing as the Revs upset the much-favored Columbus Crew. He also saved two out of four penalties in the penalty kick shootout against the Fire in the first round of the 2006 Playoffs. Reis was a finalist for the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award in both 2005 and 2006. He won the SuperLiga in 2008 and the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup in 2007 with the Revs. Reis was also named the 2008 Midnight Riders Man of the Year.

Reis retired following the 2013 season, joining the Los Angeles Galaxy as goalkeeper coach.

===International===
Reis got his first cap for the United States on January 22, 2006, a 0–0 shutout against Canada.

==Personal==
Reis was considered to be a bit of a jokester among his teammates and in the soccer community. As an April Fools&#x27; Day prank in 2004, the Revs&#x27; front office announced their newest foreign acquisition, Luis &quot;El Lobo&quot; Fangoso, who eventually turned out to be Matt Reis wearing a shaggy wig and headband. Although the initial joke died down fairly quickly, Reis&#x27; antics helped him win over many Revolution fans (to this day, Revs fans occasionally make joking references to Fangoso when discussing possible player transactions). On April 1, 2007, the Revolution announced that they had resigned Fangoso to a 2-year deal.

Reis, who is bald, also convinced Mexican international José Manuel Abundis, who had just signed with the team, to shave his head for the 2006 MLS Playoffs. This has enabled Reis to achieve cult status among Revs fans who know him as the &quot;Skin headed, short sleeved shot stopper&quot;.

Reis is married to Nicole Reis (née Odom), who was an All American Softball player at UCLA. They have three boys. He is the son of J.T. and Kathy Reis of Mission Viejo, California, and he has one older brother, Mike.

On 15 April 2013, Reis was present at the Boston Marathon bombing where he saved the life of his father-in-law (John Odom), whose legs had been pierced by shrapnel, causing two severed arteries.

<text>The Măcin Mountains () is a mountain range in Tulcea County, Romania. Part of the Northern Dobruja Massif, they are located between Danube River to the north and west, Taița River and &quot;Culmea Niculițelului&quot; to the east and Casimcea Plateau to the south. Seen from the Danube, they seem only low hills. However, they are a mountainous region.

The Măcin Mountains are one of the oldest in Romania, being formed in the second part of the Paleozoic, in the Carboniferous and Permian, during the Hercynian orogeny. The predominant rock is granite. Erosion (caused by the difference of temperature) has created steep slopes, with the aspect of ruins.

They are divided in &quot;Culmea Măcinului&quot; (the southern part) and &quot;Culmea Pricopanului&quot; (the northern part). The highest peak is &quot;Țuțuiatu&quot; (also called &quot;Greci&quot;), which has a height of 467 meters. Other important peaks are &quot;Priopcea&quot; Hill (410 m) and &quot;Muntele lui Iacob&quot; (Iacob&#x27;s Mountain – 341 m).

==Vegetation and avifauna==
Besides the Balkanic and sub-Mediterranean forests, the Măcin Mountains also have a considerable swathe of steppe, making it a delightful site for birds. The area is a staging point for various migratory bird species, especially raptors, who arrive here in autumn. The region is home to species such as European turtle dove, red-rumped swallow, common and isabelline wheatears, ortolan bunting and several others. Măcin Mountains are also the hunting grounds of the long-legged buzzard (&quot;Buteo rufinus&quot;), one of Europe&#x27;s largest buzzards. It shares the mountains with other birds of prey such as short-toed eagle, booted eagle, Levant sparrowhawk and saker falcon.

<text>Julian Scherner (23 September 1895 – 28 April 1945) was a Nazi Party official and a high-ranking member in the SS of Nazi Germany. During World War II, he served as the SS and Police Leader of Kraków, Germany-occupied Poland.

==Early life==
Scherner was born on 23 September 1895, in the town of Bagamoyo in German East Africa, where he lived until the age of two. Scherner attended the cadet schools, &quot;Kadettenanstalt&quot;, Karlsruhe between 1 October 1905 and 1911 and Berlin-Lichterfield between 1911 and 1914. Scherner was enlisted in the &quot;infantrie&quot; rgt. 114 between 15 March 1912 and 10 August 1914. During this time, Scherner earned the rank of &quot;Fähnrich&quot; in April 1914 and received officer rank on 5 August 1914. In 1914, he joined the &quot;Reichsheer&quot; or Imperial army. Scherner served in World War 1 as a &quot;Zugführer&quot;, &quot;Kompanieführer&quot;, company commander and platoon leader. Scherner was injured by shell splinters and rifle fire in the ankle and head respectively and was hospitalized between 1914 and 1915. After Scherner was released from the hospital, in 1915, he returned to his military unit but was captured by the French in May 1915. Scherner was awarded the Iron Cross second class and the Wound Badge in black and subsequently discharged from the military on 30 March 1920, with the rank of Oberleutnant.

After retiring from the military in 1920, he joined the &quot;Freikorps Oberland.&quot; Following the war, Scherner worked as a bank clerk from 1920 until 1924, then as a shop assistant until 1930 and after that as a partner in a merchant’s business until 1934.

Scherner married Rosita S (born 1 May 1899) on 1 May 1924. Scherner and his wife had two children. In 1923, Scherner took part in the Hitler-Ludendorff Putsch and was ultimately injured and arrested following the failure and ensuing chaos.

== SS career ==
Scherner joined the SS on 28 December 1932, and became a salaried SS officer in June 1934. Scherner commanded the SS training camp at Dachau between October 1937 and March 1940. Scherner eventually relocated to the SS Officer School at Bad Tölz. From September 1939 to 11 November 1939 he was regimental commander of the &quot;SS-Gebirgsjäger-Regiment 11 &quot;Reinhard Heydrich&quot;&quot;. From summer to the winter of 1940, he was commander of the &quot;8 Totenkopf-Standarte&quot;. As an SS garrison commander of Prague, between January and September 1941, Scherner supervised preparations for the establishment of a Waffen-SS training camp at Benešov, Bohemia. On 4 August 1941, Scherner was appointed SS and Police Leader in German-occupied Kraków.

=== Early corruption ===
Scherner was a close acquaintance of Oberscharführer Heinz Klare, meeting with him on numerous occasions. Scherner aided Klare in receiving extended work leave and enabled Klare&#x27;s entry into the Waffen-SS while also guaranteeing Klare sick leave for a heart problem. Klare joined Scherner’s staff as ordnance officer and on 15 December 1941, became Scherner&#x27;s personal adjutant. Scherner borrowed money numerous times from Klare personally and from Klare’s expense account, in violation of standing orders, over the course of 1941–1942. Klare and Scherner were condemned for living indecently and for possession of illegal food and spirits. The following investigation resulted in Klare’s arrest for possible involvement in black market dealings. Klare alleged that Scherner owed him money and had embezzled food stuffs and inappropriately used his service vehicle. The investigation yielded little punishment for Scherner. However, Scherner was reprimanded by the Reichsführer, Himmler, for his luxurious lifestyle. Himmler gave Scherner a serious warning and then tasked the court with investigating Scherner’s dealings. SS-Obergruppenführer Fredrich- Wilhelm Krüger, an acquaintance of Scherner&#x27;s since childhood, asserted confidence in Scherner saying &quot;[Scherner] is very companionable and helpful towards everyone. He gets close very quickly to every person, but unfortunately does not possess the ability to recognise &quot;[sic]&quot; and comply with the prescribed boundaries that apply to him in his official position towards subordinates.&quot; The judge decided Scherner had inappropriately abused his resources as well as helped Klare avoid the draft. The judge further concluded that Scherner had not been a party to military corruption and did not find Scherner&#x27;s actions worthy of a court punishment. Scherner was sentenced to 14 days of, &quot;Stubenarrest&quot;, house arrest but this punishment was postponed until after the war and ultimately never imposed.

=== Destruction of the Krakow ghetto ===
Scherner along with Richard Wendler, were supportive of the murder and deporting of Jews as the &quot;solution to the Jewish question&quot;. On 28–29 May 1942, Scherner began deportations from Krakow. Police battalions, commanded by Scherner, encircled the ghetto and announced all Jews were to required to register and would be killed if they did not comply. After the initial deportation, in May 1942, Scherner began an extensive murder campaign against the Jews within his jurisdiction. The murder operation moved through Tarnow, Rzeszow, Debica, Przemysl, Jaroslaw, Jaslo, Krosno, Nowy Sacz, Nowy Targ, Sanok and Miechow. Tarnow became the location for numerous mass shootings, the victims of which number approximately 10,000. In June 1942, 6,000 Jews from the Tarnow ghetto including men, women, children and hundreds of orphan children were murdered.

Although, the exact date is unclear, the official agreement to build the Płaszów concentration camp was likely in the autumn of 1942. Scherner gave orders regarding the construction of Płaszów, appointed the camp officers, was responsible for important camp matters and personally visited the camp. In November 1942, Scherner ordered all employed Jews to be congregated into forced labor camps. In 1943, Scherner gave orders to further isolate the working Jews. This was done as a preventative measure after Jewish rebellions.

Scherner was responsible for the deportations to the Bełżec extermination camp, the mass shootings in Tarnów and all &#x27;evacuations&#x27; that took place during his time there - including Aktion Krakau. He liquidated Kraków Ghetto by deporting its inhabitants to Auschwitz.

His position afforded him a great deal of authority in many areas, as the title of SS and Police Leader was conferred to high-ranking Nazi Party members, reporting directly to Himmler&#x27;s deputy. Like Amon Göth, Scherner was far too interested in the confiscated goods from the Płaszów camp. Scherner was transferred to Dachau in April 1944 and appeared before an SS Court (the dreaded &quot;Hauptamt SS-Gericht&quot;) on 16 October 1944. As a result, Scherner was demoted from SS-&quot;Oberführer der Reserve&quot; (Senior Colonel or Brigadier) in the Waffen-SS (1937-1944) to SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer der Reserve&quot; (Captain) and transferred to the Dirlewanger Brigade (formally the 36th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS) under SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Dr. Oskar Dirlewanger.

He was found dead shortly before the war ended in a wooded area near Heidesee between Märkisch Buchholz and Halbe.

The Beeches is run by Dr Beth Glover who took the practice over from her father when he died. Beth&#x27;s partner at the practice is Dr Will Preston who, at this time, would prefer a day on the golf course to a full day&#x27;s surgery. After initial tensions and despite Will&#x27;s concerns, Beth invites Jack to be a partner at the practice. Jack and Beth share an instant chemistry and after several misunderstandings they finally get together towards the end of Series 1. Will on the other hand faces marital problems with his wife Sarah. He is broken when he discovers she has been having an affair with Daniel Acres, a doctor from the rival health centre. Pressure to keep her and their two children, Tony and Julien, in a posh house results in Will committing a fraudulent drugs trial.

Meanwhile, after years of trying for a baby, landlords of the local pub Chloe and James White have a daughter named Sarah-Jane.

===Series 2 – 1994===
Jack and Beth have grown closer during the series break and in the opening episode, Jack asks for Beth&#x27;s hand in marriage.

Will and Sarah divorce but find it hard to lead separate lives. On several occasions, they almost give into temptation but Will realises they are better off apart. Whilst in Africa, Jack realises how much he has changed and how much he misses Beth. He returns to Cardale and they try for a family. Beth soon falls pregnant but happiness turns to tragedy when she loses the baby. The Beeches take on trainee GP Andrew Attwood (Gary Mavers) and he moves into the pub whilst completing his exams. Andrew makes Will feel unsettled at the Beeches and he decides to take a job in an inner-city practice. Beth too is looking for a change and finds it hard to shake off her miscarriage.

<text>Adelmo Fornaciari (; born 25 September 1955), more commonly known by his stage name Zucchero Fornaciari or simply Zucchero (), is an Italian singer, musician and songwriter. His stage name is the Italian word for &quot;sugar&quot;, as his primary school teacher used to call him. His music is largely inspired by gospel, soul, blues and rock music, and alternates between Italian ballads and more rhythmic R&amp;B-boogie-like pieces. He is credited as the &quot;father of Italian blues&quot;, introducing blues to the big stage in Italy. He is one of the few European blues artists who still enjoys great international success.

In his career, spanning four decades, Fornaciari has sold over 60 million records around the world, and internationally his most successful singles are &quot;Diamante&quot;, &quot;Il Volo/My Love&quot;, &quot;Baila (Sexy Thing)/Baila morena&quot;, and the duet &quot;Senza una donna (Without a Woman)&quot; with Paul Young. He has won numerous awards, including four Festivalbar, nine Wind Music Awards, two World Music Awards (1993, 1996), six IFPI Europe Platinum Awards, and a Grammy Award nomination. He has collaborated and performed with many famous artists, including Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Brian May, Miles Davis, Ray Charles, Billy Preston, John Lee Hooker, Scorpions, Sheryl Crow, Blues Brothers Band, Elvis Costello, Roland Orzabal, Joe Cocker, Sharon Corr, B. B. King, Sting, Buddy Guy, Bono, Bryan Adams, Mark Knopfler, Iggy Pop, Coldplay, Dolores O&#x27;Riordan, Paul Young, Peter Gabriel, Alejandro Sanz, Luciano Pavarotti, and Andrea Bocelli.

==Early life==
Adelmo Fornaciari was born 25 September 1955 in Roncocesi, a &quot;frazione&quot; (small village) near Reggio Emilia. His father, Giuseppe Fornaciari, and mother, Rina Bondavalli, came from rural families. At a young age, he was the goalkeeper of A.C. Reggiana 1919. He spent most of his childhood in the seaside town of Forte dei Marmi (Province of Lucca, Tuscany). There, he sang in the choir and played an organ in the local church. At the age of 12 or 13, he discovered American soul and blues music thanks to an African-American friend who was studying in Bologna and lived near his home. The first song he played to Fornaciari was &quot;(Sittin&#x27; On) The Dock of the Bay&quot; by Otis Redding, and this immediately inspired his interest in soul music. The friend taught Fornaciari how to play on the guitar songs by Redding, Marvin Gaye, and Sam &amp; Dave. Fornaciari then got together with friends to play rhythm and blues, finding his own way to fuse black music and Mediterranean music. He started writing his own songs when he was 13 or 14 years old, and after learning basic instruments, from 16 he moved on to learning the tenor saxophone. In Forte dei Marmi, he finished his technical high school studies, and moved again, this time to the city of Carrara.

==Career==

===1970–1986: early career and first albums===
His musical career began in 1970, with several small bands such as I Duca, Le nuove luci, I Decals, Sugar &amp; Daniel, Sugar &amp; Candies. At that time, he was studying veterinary medicine; although he liked animals and the course (taking 39 out of the 51 exams), he wanted to be different from his parents and withdrew from the course in order to pursue his aspirations. In 1975, he went to San Francisco, and there met the young Corrado Rustici from Naples, his future record producer. They talked about a future collaboration on a project with Afro-American influences which was then unusual for Italy 

In 1979, Zucchero wrote &quot;Tutto di te&quot; by Fred Bongusto, and the hit &quot;Te ne vai&quot; by Michele Pecora. He found initial success with a band named Taxi, with whom he won the Castrocaro Music Festival in 1981. He made his first appearance in the famous Sanremo Music Festival in 1982 with the song &quot;Una notte che vola via&quot; but without success. However, he wrote and produced the festival hit song &quot;Lisa&quot; by Stefano Sani. In the 1983 festival, he had a similar success with &quot;Nuvola&quot;, and went on to write four other festival songs, including &quot;Volevo dirti&quot;, sung by Donatella Milani, which was placed second. His first album, &quot;Un po&#x27; di Zucchero&quot;, was released the same year with moderate success. Although as a young songwriter, he had great success, his solo career did not initially reach the same level of success that he and producers had expected.

Disappointed with his solo career, in 1984 he temporarily moved to San Francisco in California, where he collaborated with his old friend Corrado Rustici. The result of these sessions, with a backing band that included bassist Randy Jackson, was the 1985 album &quot;Zucchero &amp; The Randy Jackson Band&quot;, and the song &quot;Donne&quot; (in English, &quot;Women&quot;). He again played at the Sanremo festival and, although the song &quot;Donne&quot; ended up in a disappointing penultimate place (due to the festival critics), it became a hit single and one of the classic Italian songs. After the relative success of &quot;Zucchero &amp; The Randy Jackson Band&quot;, Fornaciari joined Rustici again in California to work on a follow-up album. &quot;Rispetto&quot; (1986) (in English, &quot;Respect&quot;) included several Italian hit singles, including the title track and &quot;Come il sole all&#x27;improvviso&quot; (in English, &quot;Suddenly, like the sun&quot;). It went platinum and sold over 300,000 copies.

===1987–1994: breakthrough in Italy and first international successes ===
Although &quot;Zucchero &amp; The Randy Jackson Band&quot; and &quot;Rispetto&quot; were commercially successful, it was the 1987 album &quot;Blue&#x27;s&quot; that went on to become the highest selling album in Italian history (until his following album in 1989), selling 1.5 million copies in 1987 alone; it made Fornaciari a household name in Italy, and neighbouring countries. The album, again produced by Rustici and featuring musical performances by Clarence Clemons, The Memphis Horns and David Sancious, included the Italian hit singles &quot;Con Le Mani&quot; (in English, &quot;With the hands&quot;), with lyrics by Gino Paoli, the controversial &quot;Solo una sana...&quot; (in English &quot;Only a healthy...&quot;), and the original version of &quot;Senza una donna&quot; (in English, &quot;Without a woman&quot;) which later became an international hit in a duet version with Paul Young. During the following Blue&#x27;s Tour Fornaciari shared the stage with Joe Cocker (for a cover of &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;), Ray Charles and Dee Dee Bridgewater. In the same year, he also composed the soundtrack for the film &quot;Snack Bar Budapest,&quot; written and directed by Tinto Brass.

In 1989, Fornaciari and his band recorded the album &quot;Oro Incenso &amp; Birra&quot; in Memphis. The album, which was greatly influenced by American soul music, included guest appearances by Ennio Morricone, Eric Clapton, and blues singer Rufus Thomas; Fornaciari&#x27;s band by that time included former E-Street Band member David Sancious. The album still stands as not only one of Fornaciari&#x27;s, but also Italian most successful albums, outselling even &quot;Blue&#x27;s&quot; and includes the Italian hit singles &quot;Diamante&quot; (lyrics written by Francesco De Gregori, dedicated to Zucchero&#x27;s grandmother Diamante), &quot;Overdose (d&#x27;Amore)&quot;, &quot;Il Mare&quot; and &quot;Wonderful World&quot;. The single &quot;Diamante&quot; included new version of the song &quot;Dune Mosse&quot; recorded along Miles Davis. Davis himself insisted to re-record the song with Zucchero, describing it &quot;interesting Mediterranean type of blues&quot;. As of 2015 are reported sales of over 8 million copies. By the &quot;Rolling Stone Italia&quot; it was included among the most beautiful Italian music albums of all time.

After the million selling success of &quot;Blue&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Oro Incenso &amp; Birra&quot; in Italy, and his live collaborations with Joe Cocker, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton (whom supported on tour and performed at Royal Albert Hall in London) and Miles Davis, Fornaciari from 1990 on attempted to conquer the rest of Europe. The album &quot;Blue&#x27;s&quot; was released the following year in the United Kingdom, and in 1990 &quot;Zucchero Sings His Hits in English&quot;, an album that featured songs from the &quot;Blue&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Oro Incenso &amp; Birra&quot; albums, some of which translated to English by Frank Musker, was released worldwide.

Fornaciari&#x27;s best known hit &quot;Senza una donna&quot; (&quot;Without a Woman&quot;), in a duet with Paul Young, is from this album. The first pressing of the album didn&#x27;t feature the duet: the song was performed by Fornaciari only. The duet was a great success worldwide, it topped the European Hot 100, Italian, Belgian, Norwegian, and Swedish charts, and reached the top 3–5 in other international charts in 1991 including UK and US. Other European singles from the Hits album include English versions of &quot;Diamante&quot;, and &quot;Wonderful World&quot; (with Eric Clapton). Diamante was later released as a duet with Randy Crawford, a variant not available on any album until the special edition of &quot;Zu &amp; Co.&quot; (2004). Although advised to record in English to achieve international popularity he expressed doubt; &quot;unfortunately, the only songs you can translate easily into English are the ballads, the love songs. That is a shame&quot;.

Between 1991 and 1993 Fornaciari continued duetting with some of the world&#x27;s most famous artists, such as Sting, Luciano Pavarotti, a young Andrea Bocelli (who after the Zucchero&#x27;s collaboration on &quot;Miserere&quot; started to get growing popularity), Peter Maffay, Elton John, Brian May and Eric Clapton. Many of these duets would later be included in the compilation &quot;Zu &amp; Co.&quot; (2004). The 1991 was released Fornaciari&#x27;s first live album &quot;Live at the Kremlin&quot;, recorded in Moscow Kremlin 1990 (being the first Western artist to perform there after the fall of Berlin Wall) and featuring guest appearances by Randy Crawford (on John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;) and Toni Childs. In 1992 was invited by Brian May to perform at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, with the remaining three members of Queen - Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor, singing &quot;Las Palabras de Amor&quot;. He admitted having been &#x27;terrified&#x27; before hitting the Wembley Stadium stage, as this was his first time performing live at a worldwide broadcast event. In 1993 was invited by Dan Aykroyd to perform at House of Blues in celebration of 46th birthday of John Belushi, playing &quot;Diavolo in me&quot; and &quot;You are so beautiful&quot; supported by The Blues Brothers Band.

Between 1992 and 2003 was the regular cast of the charity concerts Pavarotti &amp; Friends organized by Luciano Pavarotti, where also performed along Pavarotti and B.B. King, for the children in Bosnia, Liberia, Guatemala, Kosovo, Cambodia, Tibet, Angola and Iraq.

In 1992 Fornaciari released the million selling album &quot;Miserere&quot;. Again produced by Corrado Rustici, it was a much darker album than Fornaciari&#x27;s previous works, which was made clear by the title track &quot;Miserere&quot; (Have Mercy), a duet with Luciano Pavarotti. The &quot;darkness&quot; reflects his intimate personal life from the time when lived in solitude and depression after the divorce. Elvis Costello co-wrote the track &quot;Miss Mary&quot;, U2&#x27;s Bono was responsible for the English version of the &quot;Miserere&quot;, and Paul Buchanan of The Blue Nile co-wrote two tracks. On the album and during the tour, Fornaciari was accompanied by former Santana drummer Michael Shrieve. The English version of the title track &quot;Miserere&quot; peaked at number 15 in UK. The compilation album &quot;Diamante&quot; was released in Mexico and other Latin American countries in 1994, and was an attempt to use the same method of &quot;Zucchero sings his hits in English&quot; for the Spanish and Latin American market. In 1994 Zucchero was the only Italian artist to perform at the 25th anniversary edition of the Woodstock festival.

===1995–2008: peak of musical career===
The 1995 album &quot;Spirito DiVino&quot;, that included the smash European hits &quot;Il Volo&quot;, &quot;Papà perché?&quot; and &quot;X colpa di chi&quot;, is one of Fornaciari&#x27;s most successful up to date, selling over 2,5 million copies in Europe alone (until 1996) and ending up on the first place in the Italian year charts, and Top 5 in France and Switzerland, the album proved a huge commercial success. On the album Fornaciari adds a certain New Orleans blues feeling to his music (especially on songs like &quot;Voodoo Voodoo&quot;) and is accompanied by musicians such as David Sancious, Jeff Beck (on &quot;Papa Perché?&quot;), Sheila E. (on &quot;Alleluja&quot;, written by Italian rapper Jovanotti) and former Chuck Berry pianist Johnny Johnson. It, with the upcoming compilation, was promoted with over 150 concerts, an estimated audience of 1.4 million people.

The compilation &quot;The Best of Zucchero Sugar Fornaciari&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; was released in 1996, shooting into all European charts, up to the number one position in France and Italy, and selling over 3 million copies in Europe. The CD, released in an Italian and an English version, contained 13 of Fornaciari&#x27;s greatest hits (excluding the &quot;Miserere&quot; period) and three new songs including the hit single &quot;Menta e rosmarino&quot; (&quot;I feel so lonely tonight&quot;). The re-redition in 1997 included Continental hit cover of &quot;Va pensiero&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi. During the sold-out tour Fornaciari sang with Buddy Guy in Milan, and played &quot;My Love&quot; (the English version of &quot;Il Volo&quot;) and &quot;Un piccolo aiuto&quot; (together with Eric Clapton) during the &#x27;96 Pavarotti and Friends show. The Best of Tour also brought Fornaciari to the US for the first time playing to four sold out consecutive concerts at House of Blue in Los Angeles. He performed for the fundraising Rainforest Foundation in New York, and Zoological Society of Florida, Miami.

On the 1998 album &quot;Bluesugar&quot;, Fornaciari moved from &quot;Spirito DiVino&quot;&#x27;s New Orleans feeling to a more British rock style, like of Robert Johnson and Radiohead. The band recording it included Santana bassist Benny Rietveld and bluesharp player Mark Feltham. Steve Winwood played Hammond on two songs, while Bono wrote the lyrics to the English version of lead single &quot;Blu&quot;. The album went on to sell over 1 million copies in several months. In February 1999 in UK was released a duet of &quot;Va Pensiero&quot; along Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. The world tour included for the first time Australia and Asia. In 1999 was invited by Bono to participate at charity NetAid event, where at Giants Stadium in New Jersey performed &quot;Il volo&quot;, along Bono U2&#x27;s One, and with various artists the single song &quot;New Day&quot;.
Following a lengthy tour to promote &quot;Bluesugar&quot;, Fornaciari took some time off to work on new music. In the 2001 production of the Sanremo Festival, Zucchero co-wrote the songs &quot;Luce (Tramonti a nord est)&quot; by Elisa, and &quot;Di sole e d&#x27;azzurro&quot; by Giorgia, which charted as first and second respectively, both winning the festival awards. He reappeared in the summer of 2001 with the European hit single &quot;Baila morena&quot; (re-released in 2006), described as &quot;swinging track densely populated with crunching electric guitars, thick piano and organ vamps, and soaring bluesy female vocals over Zucchero&#x27;s trademark rasp&quot;. The album &quot;Shake&quot;, that followed two months later, ended up being another European million selling album. The album is described as &quot;multi-layered blend of acoustic and electric guitars, and the interplay of various vocal ranges and languages set the tone for a stunning album with unfailingly excellent material&quot;. On the album blues musician John Lee Hooker appears on the ballad &quot;Ali D&#x27;Oro&quot;, his last recording before his death in June 2001. In 2002 and 2003 Fornaciari and his band toured throughout Europe and Canada with the sold-out &quot;Shake&quot; tour. In December 2002 at the Italian Music Awards received by FIMI the &quot;Special Award — Italian Artist in the World&quot;.

Zucchero performed the Italian versions of the songs from the DreamWorks animated drama &quot;&quot; (2002). On 29 November 2003, participated in the 46664 charity (AIDS) concert at Green Point Stadium, Cape Town, as well again in 2005, organized by Nelson Mandela. At the concerts, he was invited by Brian May to become the new singer for Queen replacing Freddie Mercury, but he declined, and they continued forming Queen + Paul Rodgers.

The spring of 2004 saw the release of the duet album &quot;Zu &amp; Co.&quot;, top five success in Europe. On the album, which had been sixteen years in the making, Fornaciari duets with international stars. On 6 May 2004 the album was presented during a concert in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, where many of the album&#x27;s gueststars appeared to perform with Fornaciari. The American 2005 album edition was released in partnership with the Starbucks Hear Music label and Concord Records, and managed to enter the Billboard 200 and top the World Albums chart. They included cover &quot;Indaco Dagli Occhi Del Cielo&quot; (&quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got to Learn Sometime&quot; by The Korgis). In July 2005, Fornaciari took part in the Live 8 concerts in both Rome and Paris.

In September 2006 was released million selling studio album &quot;Fly&quot;, certified 5× Platinum in Italy. Produced by Don Was, it included the European hit singles &quot;Bacco perbacco&quot; and &quot;Occhi&quot;, and features collaborations with artists such as Ivano Fossati and Jovanotti. The album&#x27;s track &quot;L&#x27;amore è nell&#x27;aria&quot;, borrows the instrumental backing to the B-side &quot;Broken&quot; by UK rock band Feeder, as was co-written by their lead singer Grant Nicholas. The Fly Tour, kicking off in May in Paris, France, has included dates in most European countries, as well as the U.S. (including a show in Carnegie Hall in New York), and Latin America, with over 100 concerts worldwide.

At the 49th Annual Grammy Awards got nominated for Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance for the song &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot; along Sam Moore Billy Preston, Eric Clapton, Robert Randolph. In November 2007, Fornaciari released a new compilation album &quot;All the Best&quot; with several new tracks, including a popular cover of Black&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;. In the spring of 2008 Fornaciari began his All the Best Tour, which included stops in Europe, America, and Australia where he was joined on stage by Tina Arena in Sydney. November 2008 also saw the release of &quot;Live in Italy&quot;, a double boxset with recordings of sold-out Arena performance in Verona in 2007, and Milan in 2008, as well as three new tracks, including the single &quot;Una Carezza&quot;, published by Edizioni Larus and Universal Music Group. In June 2008 also performed at the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute held in Hyde Park, London. In 2009 at Ischia Global Film &amp; Music Fest received the Global Music Award.

===2009–2014: &quot;Chocabeck&quot; and cuban parenthesis===

In November 2010, Fornaciari released a studio album entitled &quot;Chocabeck&quot;, certified 5× Platinum in Italy. The album was produced by Don Was, Brendan O&#x27;Brien, and Zucchero and includes collaborations with Brian Wilson, Roland Orzabal (&quot;God bless the child&quot;), and Bono (&quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Tears&quot;). The first single in Italy was the song &quot;È Un Peccato Morir&quot;, followed by hits &quot;Chocabeck&quot;, and &quot;Vedo Nero&quot;. In March 2011, after three years, Zucchero started the Chocabeck World Tour, notably with five consecutive concerts at the Arena in Verona.

<text>100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong is a box set by Bon Jovi, released in 2004 through Island Records. A collection of demos and B-sides, it was released to celebrate the band&#x27;s twentieth anniversary and their milestone of selling 100 million records worldwide.

==Content==
The box set consists of 4 CDs, and also includes a DVD of the band talking about the tracks and additional archive candid footage of the band. Additionally, the Japanese version of the box set also includes a fifth CD. The box set charted at #53 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Apart from songs released as iTunes singles &quot;The Radio Saved My Life Tonight&quot; was released as a promo CD single for the box set. The song was since played extensively on the bands following Have a Nice Day Tour.

The box set includes the songs &quot;Real Life&quot; and &quot;Good Guys Don&#x27;t Always Wear White&quot; which were previously released as singles for soundtrack albums but never featured on a Bon Jovi album until now. &quot;Edge of a Broken Heart&quot; was also previously released for a soundtrack album and the Slippery When Wet 2-CD Special Edition Bonus CD (PHCR-90015/6) in 1998.

The album title and the cover art is a play on the 1959 Elvis Presley compilation &quot;50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;.

==Track listing==


==&quot;Best of the Boxset&quot; (Single disc version)==

<text>Grand opera is a genre of 19th-century opera generally in four or five acts, characterized by large-scale casts and orchestras. The original productions consisted of spectacular design and stage effects with plots normally based on or around dramatic historic events. The term is particularly applied (sometimes specifically used in its French-language equivalent grand opéra, ) to certain productions of the Paris Opéra from the late 1820s to around 1860; &#x27;grand opéra&#x27; has sometimes been used to denote the Paris Opéra itself.

The term &#x27;grand opera&#x27; is also used in a broader application in respect of contemporary or later works of similar monumental proportions from France, Germany, Italy, and other countries.

It may also be used colloquially in an imprecise sense to refer to &#x27;serious opera without spoken dialogue&#x27;.

==Origins==
Paris at the turn of the 19th century drew in many composers, both French and foreign, especially those of opera. Several Italians working during this period, including Luigi Cherubini, demonstrated that the use of recitative was suited for the powerful dramas that were being written. Others, such as Gaspare Spontini, wrote works to glorify Napoleon. These operas were composed on a suitably grand scale for the Emperor. Other factors which led to Parisian supremacy at operatic spectacle were the ability of the large Paris Opéra to stage sizeable works and recruit leading stage-painters, designers and technicians, the long tradition of French ballet, and the art of stagecraft. The first theatre performance lit by gas, for example, was &quot;Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse&quot; at the Opéra in 1823. The theatre had the innovative designers Duponchel, Cicéri and Daguerre on its staff as well. 

Several operas by Gaspare Spontini, Luigi Cherubini, and Gioachino Rossini can be regarded as precursors to French grand opera. These include Spontini&#x27;s &quot;La vestale&quot; (1807) and &quot;Fernand Cortez&quot; (1809, revised 1817), Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Les Abencérages&quot; (1813), and Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Le siège de Corinthe&quot; (1827) and &quot;Moïse et Pharaon&quot; (1828). All of these have some of the characteristics of size and spectacle that are normally associated with French grand opera. Another important forerunner was &quot;Il crociato in Egitto&quot; by Meyerbeer, who eventually became the acknowledged king of the grand opera genre. In &quot;Il crociato&quot;, which was produced by Rossini in Paris in 1825 after success in Venice, Florence and London. Meyerbeer succeeded in blending Italian singing-style with an orchestral style derived from his German training, introducing a far wider range of musical theatre effects than traditional Italian opera. Moreover, &quot;Il crociato&quot; with its exotic historical setting, onstage bands, spectacular costumes and themes of culture clash, exhibited many of the features on which the popularity of grand opera would be based.

What became the essential features of &#x27;grand opéra&#x27; were foreseen by Étienne de Jouy, the librettist of &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, in an essay of 1826:

Division into five acts seems to me the most suitable for any opera that would reunite the elements of the genre: [...] where the dramatic focus was combined with the marvellous: where the nature and majesty of the subject [...] demanded the addition of attractive festivities and splendid civil and religious ceremonies to the natural flow of the action, and consequently needed frequent scene changes.

===The first grand operas (1828–1829)===

The first opera of the grand opera canon is, by common consent, (1828) by Daniel François Auber. This tale of revolution set in Naples in 1647, ending with an eruption of Mount Vesuvius into which the heroine precipitates herself, embodied the musical and scenic sensationalism which were to be grand opera&#x27;s hallmark. The libretto for &quot;La muette&quot; was by Eugène Scribe, a dominant force in French theatre of the time who specialized in melodramatic versions, often involving extremes of coincidence, of historical topics which were well-tailored for the public taste of the time. This was his first libretto for the Opéra. He was to write or be associated with many of the libretti of the most successful grand operas which followed. &quot;La muette&quot;″s reputation was enhanced by it being the touchpaper for a genuine revolution when it was produced in Brussels in 1830.

In 1829, this was followed by Rossini&#x27;s swansong &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;. The resourceful Rossini, having largely created a style of Italian opera to which European theatre had been in thrall, recognized the potential of new technology which included larger theatres and orchestras and modern instrumentation. He proved in this work that he could rise to meet them in this undoubted grand opera. However, his comfortable financial position, and the change in political climate after the July Revolution, persuaded him to quit the field. Therefore, &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; was his last public composition.

===The golden age of grand opera: 1830–1850===
After the Revolution, the new regime determined to privatize the previously state-run Opéra and the winner of the contract was a businessman who acknowledged that he knew nothing of music, Louis-Désiré Véron. However, he soon showed himself extremely shrewd at discerning public taste by investing heavily in the grand opera formula. His first new production was a work long contracted from Meyerbeer, whose premiere had been delayed by the Revolution. This was fortunate for both Véron and Meyerbeer. As Berlioz commented, Meyerbeer had &quot;not only the luck to be talented, but the talent to be lucky.&quot; Meyerbeer&#x27;s new opera &quot;Robert le diable&quot; chimed well with the liberal sentiments of 1830s France. Moreover, its potent mixture of melodrama, spectacle, titillation (including a ballet of the ghosts of debauched nuns), and dramatic arias and choruses went down extremely well with the new leaders of taste, the affluent bourgeoisie. The success of &quot;Robert&quot; was as spectacular as its production.

Over the next few years, Véron brought on Auber&#x27;s &quot;Gustave III&quot; (1833, libretto by Scribe, later adapted for Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera)&quot;, and Fromental Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot; (1835, libretto also by Scribe), and commissioned Meyerbeer&#x27;s next opera &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; (1836, libretto by Scribe and Deschamps), whose success was to prove the most enduring of all grand operas during the 19th century.

Having made a fortune in his stewardship of the Opéra, Véron cannily handed on his concession to Henri Duponchel, who continued his winning formula, if not to such financial reward. Between 1838 and 1850, the Paris Opéra staged numerous grand operas of which the most notable were Halévy&quot;’s&quot; &quot;La reine de Chypre&quot; (1841) and &quot;Charles VI&quot; (1843), Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La favorite&quot; and &quot;Les martyrs&quot; (1840) and &quot;Dom Sébastien&quot; (1843, librettos by Scribe), and Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Le prophète&quot; (1849) (Scribe again). 1847 saw the premiere of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s first opera for Paris, &quot;Jérusalem&quot;, an adaptation, meeting the grand opera conventions, of his earlier &quot;I Lombardi alla prima crociata&quot;.

===Ballet in grand opera===
A notable feature of grand opera as it developed in Paris through the 1830s was the presence of a lavish ballet, to appear at or near the beginning of its second act. This was required, not for aesthetic reasons, but to satisfy the demands of the Opera&#x27;s wealthy and aristocratic patrons, many of whom were more interested in the dancers themselves than the opera. These individuals also did not want their regular meal-times disturbed. The ballet therefore became an important element in the social prestige of the Opéra. Composers who did not comply with this tradition might suffer as a consequence, as did Richard Wagner with his attempt to stage a revised &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; as a grand opera in Paris in 1861, which had to be withdrawn after three performances, partly because the ballet was in act 1 (when the dancers&#x27; admirers were still at dinner).

===Grand operas of the 1850s and 1860s===
The most significant development, or transformation, of grand opera after the 1850s was its handling by Giuseppe Verdi, whose &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot; (1855), proved to be more widely given in Italy and other Italian-language opera houses than in France. The taste for luxury and extravagance at the French theatre declined after the 1848 revolution, and new productions on the previous scale were not so commercially viable. The popular &quot;Faust&quot; (1859) by Charles Gounod started life as an opéra comique and did not become a &quot;grand opera&quot; until rewritten in the 1860s. &quot;Les Troyens&quot; by Hector Berlioz (composed 1856–1858, later revised), was not given a full performance until nearly a century after Berlioz had died, although portions had been staged before, but the spirit of this work is far removed from the bourgeois taste of the grand opera of the 1830s and 1840s.

By the 1860s, taste for the grand style was returning. &quot;La reine de Saba&quot; by Charles Gounod was rarely given in its entirety, although the big tenor aria, &quot;Inspirez-moi, race divine&quot;, was a popular feature of tenor recitals. Meyerbeer died on 2 May 1864; his late opera, &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, was premiered posthumously in 1865. Giuseppe Verdi returned to Paris for what many see as the greatest French grand opera, &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (1867). Ambroise Thomas contributed his &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 1868, and finally, at the end of the decade, the revised &quot;Faust&quot; was premiered at the Opéra in its grand opera format.

===Late French grand operas===

During the 1870s and 1880s, a new generation of French composers continued to produce large-scale works in the tradition of grand opera but often broke its melodramatic boundaries. The influence of Wagner&#x27;s operas began to be felt, and it is a moot point whether these works can be simply called grand opera. Jules Massenet had at least two large scale historical works to his credit, &quot;Le roi de Lahore&quot; (Paris, 1877, assessed by &quot;Grove&quot; as &quot;the last grand opera to have a great and widespread success&quot;.) and &quot;Le Cid&quot; (Paris, 1885). Other works in this category include &quot;Polyeucte&quot; (Paris, 1878) by Charles Gounod and &quot;Henry VIII&quot; by Camille Saint-Saëns (Paris, 1883). Ernest Reyer had started to compose his &quot;Sigurd&quot; years earlier, but, unable to get it premiered in Paris, settled for La Monnaie in Brussels (1884). What may have been one of the last successful French grand operas was by an unfamiliar composer, Émile Paladilhe: &quot;Patrie!&quot; (Paris, 1886). It ran up nearly 100 performances in Paris, and quite a few in Belgium, where the action takes place, but has since disappeared without a trace.

===Decline of French grand opera===
The expensive artifacts of grand opera (which also demanded expensive singers)—&quot;Les Huguenots&quot; was known as &#x27;the night of the seven stars&#x27; because of its requirement of seven top-grade artistes—meant that they were economically the most vulnerable as new repertoire developed. Hence they lost pride of place at the Paris Opéra (especially when many of the original stage sets were lost in fire in the late 19th century). However, as late as 1917, the Gaîté-Lyrique devoted an entire season to the genre, including Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La reine de Chypre&quot;.

===French grand opera today===
Some of these works – &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot;, &quot;La favorite&quot;, &quot;Les vêpres siciliennes&quot; and &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, for instance – continue to have a place in the operatic repertoire. Even the pieces that are rarely staged are increasingly being resuscitated for compact disc recordings, and many are revived at opera festivals and by companies such as Palazetto Bru Zane.

After virtually disappearing from the operatic repertory worldwide in the 20th century, Meyerbeer&#x27;s major grand operas are once again being staged by leading European opera houses.

==Grand opera outside France==
===Italy===
French grand opera was generally well received in Italy, where it was always performed in Italian translation.

Italian operas with their own ballet started to become relatively common in the late 1860s and 1870s. Some of these, such as &quot;Il Guarany&quot; by the Brazilian composer Antônio Carlos Gomes were designated as &quot;opera ballo&quot; (i.e. &#x27;danced opera&#x27;). Others, such as &quot;La Gioconda&quot; by Amilcare Ponchielli were not, although they qualified for the description. They constituted an evolution of grand opera.

Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;, despite having only four acts, corresponds in many ways to the grand opera formula. It has a historical setting, deals with &#x27;culture clash&#x27; and contains several ballets as well as its extremely well known Grand March. It was a huge success, both at its world premiere in Cairo in 1871 and its Italian premiere in Milan in 1872. It led to an increase in the scale of some of the works by other composers that followed it. This was particularly noticeable in works by Gomes (&quot;Fosca&quot; in 1873, and his &quot;Salvator Rosa&quot; in 1874); Marchetti (especially &quot;Gustavo Wasa&quot; in 1875); Ponchielli: (&quot;I Lituani&quot; in 1874) and &quot;La Gioconda&quot; (Milan, 1876, revised 1880)); and Lauro Rossi (&quot;La Contessa di Mons&quot;, premiered in Turin in 1874).

Other operas on this scale continued to be composed by Italian composers during the 1880s and even 1890s, but with less frequency; examples being Marchetti&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni d&#x27;Austria&quot; (1880) and Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;Il figluol prodigo&quot; (also 1880).

===Germany===
French grand operas were regularly staged by German opera houses; an early article by Richard Wagner depicts German opera managers hurrying to Paris to try to identify the next hit. The Dresden performances of &quot;Le prophète&quot; (in German) in 1850 were the occasion for a series of articles by Wagner&#x27;s disciple, Theodor Uhlig, condemning Meyerbeer&#x27;s style and crudely attributing his alleged aesthetic failure to his Jewish origins, inspiring Wagner to write his anti-Jewish diatribe &quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot; (&quot;Jewishness in Music&quot;).

Meyerbeer himself was German by birth, but directed nearly all his mature efforts to success in Paris. Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Rienzi&quot;, the composer&#x27;s first success (produced Dresden, 1842) is totally Meyerbeerean in style. Wagner was at that time a sincere admirer of the older composer, who assisted him in arranging performances of &quot;Rienzi&quot; and &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; in Dresden and Berlin. As described above, Wagner attempted in 1860/1861 to recast &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; as a grand opera, and this &quot;Paris version&quot;, as later adapted for Vienna, is still frequently produced today. &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, as noted by George Bernard Shaw, shows clear traces of some return by Wagner to the grand opera tradition, and a case could also be argued for &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;.

Meyerbeer&#x27;s only mature German opera, &quot;Ein Feldlager in Schlesien&quot; is in effect a Singspiel, although act 2 has some of the characteristics of grand opera, with a brief ballet and an elaborate march. The opera was eventually transformed by the composer to &quot;L&#x27;étoile du nord&quot;.

In many German-language houses, especially in Vienna, where Eduard Hanslick and later Gustav Mahler championed Meyerbeer and Halévy respectively, the operas continued to be performed well into the 20th century. The growth of anti-Semitism in Germany, especially after the Nazi Party obtained political power in 1933, spelled the end of the works of these composers on German stages until modern times when &quot;La Juive&quot;, &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;, &quot;Le prophète&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; have been revived.

==North America==
The first American grand opera, &quot;Leonora&quot;, was written by the American composer William Fry for Ann Childe Seguin to take the title role in the 1840s.

<text>Marek Jurek (; 28 June 1960 in Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland) is a right-wing politician and a Member of the European Parliament. Since 20 April 2007 he has been the leader of the aspirant party Right of the Republic. Politically, he is most known for being a Marshal of the Sejm in the years 2005–2007.

==Biography==
He is a graduate in history from Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań. In the 1980s he was an activist in the anti-communist movement in Poland. After the fall of the communism in 1989, he was one of the founders of the now defunct political party Christian National Union. He was a deputy in the Contract Sejm and later in the Sejm of the Republic of Poland from 1991 to 1993.

From 1995 to 2001 he was a member of the National Broadcasting Council.

In 2001, he was elected a deputy of the Sejm again, this time as a member of the Law and Justice party. On 26 October 2005 he was elected a Sejm marshal (parliament speaker) nominated by Law and Justice with 265 votes (133 votes were given to Bronisław Komorowski from Civic Platform). On 13 April 2007 he resigned from the post, following the Sejm&#x27;s failure to amend the Constitution to protect prenatal life. On the following day, he left Law and Justice to found his own party, now known as the Right of the Republic. His resignation was accepted on 27 April 2007.

In the parliamentary election in 2007 his party did not win any seats in the Parliament as it found itself below the election threshold. On 22 June 2008 Marek Jurek took part in a by-election to the Senate, held in Krosno-constituency following the death of Senator Andrzej Mazurkiewicz. With 10 751 votes, he gained the third place after the winner Stanisław Zając (Law and Justice) and Maciej Lewicki (Civic Platform). As there was only one seat available in the Senate, Marek Jurek remains outside the Parliament.

On 27 September 2009, Jurek was awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for outstanding contribution to the independence of Polish Republic, for activities on behalf of democratic change, for achievements in undertaken for the benefit of the country and social work.

He was one of the candidates in the 2010 Polish presidential election, but received only 1.06% of votes and failed to get into the second round.

==Political positions==
Marek Jurek declared full support for the teaching of the Catholic Church as he opposes abortion, euthanasia, same sex unions and in vitro. He supports the traditional family model.

<text>Raden Haji Oma Irama, better known as Rhoma Irama (born 11 December 1946), is an Indonesian dangdut singer, songwriter and guitarist of Sundanese descent.

Starting in the late 1960s, he began his musical career as Rhoma Irama as a part of the pop band Orkes Melayu Purnama, pioneering several dangdut music elements. He then formed his band, Soneta Group, achieving multitudes of musical successes with groundbreaking dangdut style that incorporates Western, Malay, and Bollywood influences. 

From the late 1970s, he began transforming into more Islamic-oriented style, commanding the religiously pious popular music culture. During the height of his stardom in the 1970s, he was dubbed &quot;Raja Dangdut&quot; (&quot;the King of Dangdut&quot;) with his Soneta Group. He has also built his career in the film industry.

He has been active as well in the political arena, with a history of joining campaigns for the Islamic United Development Party (PPP) during the New Order era. In 2015, Irama founded Peace and Safe Islamic Party and served as the party chairman until 2018, when he decided to merge the party into the National Mandate Party.

==Early life==
Irama&#x27;s parents assigned the priyayi noble title of Raden at birth to follow his Sundanese father, Raden Burdah Anggawirya, and mother, R. Hj. Tuti Juariah.
==Career==
===1960s: Pre-Soneta===

Oma Irama&#x27;s first bands were known as Tornado and Gayhand and covered Western rock and roll music of Paul Anka, Andy Williams, and The Beatles.

In the late 1960s Oma Irama, sang Javanese and also some Indonesian pop music. In 1968 he joined the group Orkes Melayu Purnama in 1968. This group pioneered elements of the dangdut style within Orkes Melayu music – the drum was changed to double drum, the electric guitar&#x27;s role was expanded, and the suling, or bamboo flute, adopted a style reminiscent of Bollywood music. He also recorded Indonesian pop music during this period with the Zaenal Combo and Galaksi, while the album &quot;Ingkar Janji&quot; was recorded in 1969 with Orkes Melayu Chandraleka.

===Early 1970s: Soneta Group===
Once Oma broke off from recording with the Purnama Group, he formed Orkes Melayu Soneta (taken from Indonesian word of sonnet), which became the first dangdut group in 1970. The subtitle, &quot;the sound of Moslems&quot; was added in 1973.

The group featured Oma Irama and Elvy Sukaesih as singers, both solo, and duets. Their first album, &quot;Volume 01, Begadang&quot; (&quot;Stay up all night&quot;), released in 1973, featured four songs by Oma Irama, three by Elvy, and three duets. The song featured a topless Oma Irama wearing tight trousers and holding an electric guitar. His choice of pose showed the influence on his music of Western bands, influences which also found their way into his music – Orkes Melayu was in his opinion was too soft, too acoustic, too polite, and unable to compete against the power and energy of rock music, and so the music was electrified, with keyboard, two electric guitars, electric bass, as well as the traditional suling and gendang. He has stated that he took his guitar style from Ritchie Blackmore of Deep Purple. In addition to Western and Malay influences, Hindi composers were credited for some of the band&#x27;s songs.

The &quot;Begadang&quot; album ranked No. 11 on &quot;Rolling Stone Indonesia&quot;″s &quot;150 Greatest Indonesian Albums of All Time&quot; list. Furthermore, the main single &quot;Begadang&quot; reached at number 24 on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;150 Greatest Indonesian Songs of All Time&quot; list.

His 1973 hit &quot;Terajana&quot;, one of the best-known dangdut songs of all time, was the first to use the newly coined, and arguably derogatory, term &quot;dangdut&quot;, distinguishing the Javanese Orkes Melayu music, heavily influenced by Indian Bollywood records, henceforth dangdut, from the established Orkes Melayu, associated with North Sumatran Malays.

Once Soneta was established in the early 1970s, Oma changed his name to Rhoma and went on a decade-long run of successful hit records and films, all of which starred Rhoma playing himself while performing all of his hits. He wrote the classics &quot;Kereta Malam&quot; (night train) and &quot;Kuda Lumping&quot; which were sung by Elvy Sukaesih.

Performing live, he adopted many of the props of stadium rock, including large audiences, powerful sound systems, complex sets, fireworks, flashing lights, and smoke machines. He is also notable with the use of some notable musical instruments including various models of Steinberger guitars. This particular guitar was shown off in his posters, leaflets, movies, and pin-ups.

===Late 1970s onward: Islamic pious music===
Following his 1975 hajj, he took the name Rhoma Irama, which is an abbreviation of &quot;Raden Haji Oma Irama&quot; (Raden is an aristocracy title for Javanese and Sundanese cultures). Following this pilgrimage, he took on a more explicit Islamic moral tone, adopting Islamic dress, shorter hairstyles, and ejecting band members who consumed alcohol or had extra-marital sex. He also resolved that his music should instruct, and not merely entertain, a form of devotion waged through music. Themes in his music included extra-marital sex, government corruption, drugs, and gambling. The song &quot;Haram&quot; for instance, warns against both drugs and gambling, while the song &quot;Keramat&quot; asserts the instructions in Islam to honor mothers.

His 1982 movie &quot;Perjuangan dan Doa&quot; (Struggle and Prayer) was described as the world&#x27;s first Islamic rock musical movie.

==Politics==

===During Suharto-era===

Rhoma Irama campaigned for the Islamic party PPP from 1977 to 1982, and as a result he was banned from state television and radio by the Suharto regime, which was at that time enforcing separation of religion and state, and some of his songs were also banned from sale. The ban was lifted in 1988, and with Suharto himself moving towards Islam in the 1990s, dangdut became of the establishment.

===Indonesian presidential election, 2014===
At the end of 2012, Rhoma Irama, stated his intention to contest the 2014 presidential election. The Wasiat Ulama association and the Indonesia Malay Musicians Association (PAMMI) have endorsed him.

By December 2013 Rhoma Irama is proposed as one of the Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa (PKB) presidential candidate along with Jusuf Kalla and Mahfud MD.

===Peace and Safe Islamic Party===

On 14 October 2015, Rhoma declared the Peace and Safe Islamic Party (), abbreviated as Idaman. Idaman Party&#x27;s attempt to participate in the 2019 Indonesian general election failed after its registration was declined by the General Elections Commission (KPU) and its initial attempt to appeal to the General Election Supervisory Agency (Bawaslu) was defeated. The party attempted their second appeal to the State Administrative Court, and was defeated as well. After Idaman Party exhausted all possible appeal methods and failed to overturn the rejection, Rhoma declared the party merged to the National Mandate Party (PAN) on 12 May 2018.

==Controversies==
===Regarding religious issues===
In 2000s Rhoma was known to be a vocal critic of moral vice. His criticism often targeted fellow dangdut artist Inul Daratista over her dance style.

In 2003, neighbors followed by journalists caught both Rhoma Irama and Angel Lelga, an actress, in the latter&#x27;s apartment at midnight. Rhoma and Angel first stated that they were discussing religion. After several revisions including Rhoma&#x27;s picking up movie scripts, Angel confirmed that Rhoma had married her on &quot;siri&quot; ground (unregistered at the official record but permissible by Sharia) and later divorced her on the same day.

===Allegation of racism and bigotry===
During the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election, Rhoma Irama was videotaped giving a political speech in a West Jakarta mosque. Rhoma Irama warned his audience against voting for candidate pair Joko Widodo and Basuki Cahaya Purnama because according to him, the former had Christian parents and the latter is Chinese and Christian. Some of his statements were: Muslims would see their reputation sink if they elected non-Muslims, calling people by their SARA (acronym for ethnic, religion, race) characteristics is justified when defending pribumi&#x27;s interest, Joko Widodo is just a step for Basuki and Chinese to assume power. In his closing words, he alleged &quot;ethnic Malay would face subjugation by Chinese in Jakarta as they did in Singapore when it gained independence from Malaysia should Basuki be allowed to govern&quot; (Singapore did not gain independence from Malaysia but was expelled from Federation of Malaysia).

In Indonesia, attacking a person&#x27;s race or religion in a political campaign is punishable by fines and prison time. 
Further added to the controversy was the fact that campaigning in a place of worship violates the law. On 6 August, the Election Observer Commission (Panwaslu) presided by Ramdansyah summoned him to begin the investigation. The initial investigation ended with Rhoma Irama shedding tears in front of journalists saying &quot;to Joko Widodo and Basuki Purnama, I love them all&quot; but insisted he did nothing wrong. Subsequent investigation saw Rhoma Irama and Fauzi Bowo (incumbent governor) denying that Rhoma was campaigning or working as Fauzi Bowo&#x27;s campaigner despite Rhoma&#x27;s own statement in June 2012 that he and his family had become one and Rhoma&#x27;s appearance in Fauzi Bowo&#x27;s official campaign video.

Rhoma was eventually cleared of all charges by Panwaslu.
However Ramdansyah was relieved from his post after another investigation into his neutrality concluded he was unfairly siding with Fauzi Bowo re-election team. Later, Rhoma met face to face with Joko Widodo in an episode of Indonesia Lawyers Club show albeit through teleconference medium. He refused to apologize to Joko for falsely stating to his audience about the religion of Joko&#x27;s parents.

<text>Crich is a village and civil parish in the English county of Derbyshire. Besides the village of Crich, the civil parish includes the nearby villages of Fritchley, Whatstandwell and Wheatcroft. The population of the civil parish at the 2001 census was 2,821, increasing to 2,898 at the 2011 census. 

The village is home to the National Tramway Museum and, at the summit of Crich Hill above, a memorial tower for those of the Sherwood Foresters regiment who died in battle, particularly in World War I.

== History ==
In 1009 King Æthelred the Unready signed a charter at the Great Council which recognised the position and boundaries of Weston-on-Trent and several other manors including Crich. The charter shows that Weston controlled the nearby crossings of the Trent. The land was listed as eight hides at Weston upon Trent, and a hide at Crich, Morley, Smalley, Ingleby and Kidsley. This land was then given to Morcar, the King&#x27;s chief minister, and he was unusually given rights that were normally reserved for the King alone. He was given the responsibility for justice and exemption from the Trinoda necessitas, he alone could decide a fate of life or death without the need of the authority of the King or his sheriff. Morcar was given further lands in Derbyshire. Weston (and Crich?) again come under the control of Æþelræd Unræd, when Morcar and his brother were murdered by Eadric in 1015.

Parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint Mary are Norman, with later Decorated Gothic and Perpendicular Gothic alterations from the 14th century. Crich has also a Wesleyan Chapel that was built in 1770.

A workhouse was opened in 1734 on the edge of Nether Common. It could accommodate 40 inmates, and accepted paupers from other parishes, including Melbourne, Pentrich, Willington, Mercaston and Denby.

Chase Cliffe is a Tudor Revival house on the road from Crich to Whatstandwell. It was designed by Benjamin Ferrey and built in 1859–61.

== Quarrying ==

Geologically, Crich lies on a small inlier of Carboniferous limestone (an outcrop on the edge of the Peak District surrounded by younger Upper Carboniferous rocks).

Quarrying for limestone probably began in Roman times. In 1791 Benjamin Outram and Samuel Beresford bought land for a quarry to supply limestone to their new ironworks at Butterley. This became known as Hilt&#x27;s Quarry, and the stone was transported down a steep wagonway, the Butterley Company Gangroad, to the Cromford Canal at Bullbridge. Near there they also built lime kilns for supplying farmers and for the increasing amount of building work. Apart from a period when it was leased to Albert Banks, the quarry and kilns were operated by the Butterley Company until 1933.
The gangroad, descending some 300 feet in about a mile, was at first worked by gravity, a brakeman &quot;spragging&quot; the wheels of the wagons, which were returned to the summit by horses. However, in 1812 the incline was the scene of a remarkable experiment, when William Brunton, an engineer for the company, produced his Steam Horse locomotive.

=== Crich Mineral Railway ===
In 1840 George Stephenson, in building the North Midland Railway, discovered deposits of coal at Clay Cross and formed what later became the Clay Cross Company. He realised that burning lime would provide a use for the coal slack that would otherwise go to waste. He leased Cliff Quarry and built limekilns at Bullbridge. In 1841, he built the Crich Mineral Railway to connect the quarry to the limekilns at Ambergate station. This included a long, self-acting incline known as &quot;The Steep&quot;, with a maximum gradient of 1 in 5.

The railway was probably the first metre gauge railway in the world.

=== End of quarrying ===
Cliff Quarry closed in 1957, though it restarted at the western end until 2010 when it was mothballed. The eastern end was bought by the Tramway Museum in 1959.

Hilt&#x27;s Quarry closed in 1933 and is derelict. For 38 years, Rolls-Royce used it for dumping low-level radioactive waste such as enriched uranium, cobalt-60 and carbon-14. Following a campaign and blockades by villagers in the Crich and District Environment Action Group, dumping ceased in 2002. In 2004 the Government backed an Environment Agency document banning further dumping, and Rolls-Royce will be required to restore and landscape the site.

== Memorial tower ==
The memorial tower (&#x27;Crich Stand&#x27;) was completed in 1923 as a memorial to the 11,409 soldiers from the Sherwood Foresters Regiment who died in World War I, a dedication that was later extended to include World War II. It was built on an limestone outcrop above the village, at an altitude of above sea level. The location is symbolic because it is widely visible across, and gives views of, both of the two counties from which the regiment was raised (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire). It is the destination of an annual pilgrimage on the first Sunday in July.

Besides the main dedication, two further plaques dedicate the memorial to those who died serving in the Sherwood Foresters regiment from 1945 to 1970, and to those who died serving the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment from 1970 to 2007 and the Mercian Regiment since 2007. A nearby small plaque is dedicated to Brigadier J.H.M. Hackett, &#x27;Last Colonel The Sherwood Foresters 1965 – 1970 and First Colonel The Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment&#x27;.

== National Tramway Museum ==
Beneath Crich Stand, at the northern end of Crich village, is the National Tramway Museum (also known as Crich Tramway Village) which is the UK&#x27;s largest and most comprehensive museum of trams and tramways. The museum contains over 80 trams built between 1873 and 1982 and includes several exhibitions and a recreated period street containing a working pub, cafe, shop and various pieces of period street furniture.

Many of the museum&#x27;s collection of trams are operational, and carry passengers on journeys through the period street and out into the local countryside on a long running track. Along the way are the preserved 1763 facade of the Derby Assembly Rooms, a recreated Victorian public park, a woodland sculpture trail and a display on the local lead mining industry.

== Archives ==
A collection of title deeds relating to land and property in Crich is held at the Cadbury Research Library of the University of Birmingham.

== In popular culture ==
The village was a location for the setting for the ITV drama series &quot;Peak Practice&quot; (along with Ashover for a time). Images of the village also appear in the 2007 film &quot;And When Did You Last See Your Father?&quot; starring Colin Firth. In the film Firth is seen riding a motorbike up Chapel Lane.

The short is a musically narrated story about a dancing lamb, who loses his confidence after being sheared. The film was written, directed, narrated and featured the musical composition and performance of Pixar animator Bud Luckey.

==Plot==
In the American North Desert, a lamb’s elegant dancing is popular with the other animals. One day lamb-shearers arrive and shear him for wool. The other animals mock his skinny, bare state and he becomes shy and loses the confidence to dance. As the lamb mourns, a benevolent jackalope comes across him, and teaches him the merits of &quot;bounding&quot;, not just dancing (that is, getting up whenever one falls down). The lamb is converted and his joy in life is restored. The lamb&#x27;s wool eventually grows back in the winter, only for it to be cut again, but his confidence is now completely unshaken and he continues to &quot;bound.&quot;

==Voice cast==
*Bud Luckey as Lamb, Jackalope and Narrator

==Production==

Writer-director Bud Luckey designed and voiced all the characters, composed the music and wrote the story. According to the director&#x27;s commentary for &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, Brad Bird wanted to introduce the animated short by having Rick Dicker, (the superhero relocator from &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, also voiced by Luckey) enter a room, sit down, and pull out a bottle of &quot;booze&quot; and a banjo.

This is the first Pixar short with a theatrical release that included vocal performances with words (Bobby McFerrin did an acapella song for &quot;Knick Knack&quot;). All prior films included only music and sound effects.

The &quot;Cars&quot; DVD contains a version of &quot;Boundin&quot;&#x27; with Mater as the jackalope, Lightning McQueen as the lamb, and Guido as the gophers as an Easter egg.

==Theatrical and home media release==
To qualify for the 76th Academy Awards, Pixar debuted in December 2003 special screenings of the short at the Laemmle Theatres in Los Angeles.

&quot;Boundin&quot;&#x27; was released on March 15, 2005, on &quot;The Incredibles&quot; two-disc DVD collector&#x27;s release, including commentary from Bud Luckey and the short clip titled &quot;Who is Bud Luckey?&quot;. The film was also released as part of &quot;Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1&quot; in 2007.

<text>Lake Claire is a neighborhood on the east side of Atlanta, Georgia, United States, comprising approximately 1,200 homes. It is situated entirely in the DeKalb County side of the city, east of Candler Park, north of Kirkwood, west of Decatur, and south of Druid Hills.

There was never an actual body of water known as Lake Claire; rather, the name was shorthand for the intersection of Lakeshore and Claire Drives. The closest thing to a commercial district is the small strip bordering Candler Park at McLendon and Clifton.

Part of the neighborhood lies with the Candler Park Historic District, which has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Education==
Residents in Lake Claire are within Atlanta Public Schools.

Zoned schools include: :

<text>Gherla (; ; ) is a municipality in Cluj County, Romania (in the historical region of Transylvania). It is located from Cluj-Napoca on the river Someșul Mic, and has a population of 19,873 as of 2021. Three villages are administered by the city: Băița (formerly &quot;Chirău&quot;, and &quot;Kérő&quot; in Hungarian), Hășdate (&quot;Szamoshesdát&quot;) and Silivaș (&quot;Vizszilvás&quot;).

The city was formerly known as &quot;Armenopolis&quot; ( &quot;Hayakaghak&quot;; ; ) because it was populated by Armenians.

== History ==

A clay tablet containing a fragmentary Old Persian cuneiform of the Achaemenid king Darius I was found at Gherla in 1937. It may be connected to Darius I&#x27;s epigraphic activities in relation to his Scythian campaign of 513 BC as reported by Herodotus.

The locality was first recorded in 1291 as a village named &quot;Gherlahida,&quot; (probably derived from the Slavic word &quot;grle&quot;, meaning &quot;ford&quot;). The second name was Armenian () meaning &quot;Armenian city&quot;; it took the Medieval Latin and Greek official name &quot;Armenopolis&quot;, as well as the German alternative name &quot;Armenierstadt&quot;. Later, the name &quot;Szamosújvár&quot; was used in official Hungarian records, meaning &quot;the new town on the Someș&quot;. 

The modern city was built in the early 18th century by Armenians, successors of the Cilician Armenian diaspora, who had originally settled in Crimea and Moldavia, and moved to Transylvania sometime after 1650. After a two years&#x27; campaign by the Armenian-Catholic Bishop Oxendius Vărzărescu, they converted from the Armenian Apostolic Church to the Armenian Catholic Church; an Armenian Catholic cathedral in Gherla was consecrated in 1748.

Gherla is the seat of the Ordinariate for Catholics of Armenian Rite in Romania, as well as that of a Greek-Catholic diocese – the Cluj-Gherla Diocese (suffragan to the Greek-Catholic Archbishop of Alba Iulia and Făgăraș-Blaj, who resided in Blaj). In the center of the city lie the Saint Gregory the Illuminator and the Holy Trinity Armenian Cathedral. The main Armenian-Catholic church was built in 1792. The Greek Catholic diocese was created by the Papal Bull &quot;Ad Apostolicam Sedem&quot; of November 26, 1853, and the first bishop was Ioan Alexi. 

A Habsburg fortress was built here and converted to a prison in 1785. During the Communist regime, the prison was used for political detainees. Today it is a Romanian high-security prison. 

During the Years of Revolution of 1848 and 1849, Gherla was the stage for numerous battles between the warring parties, changing hands several times. The Austrian commander Karl von Urban and his Romanian Regiment liberated the city three times from Hungarian revolutionary forces, winning the Battle of Szamosújvár on 13 November 1848, a landmark of the stormy period. Starting in 1867, Gherla was no more part of the Principality of Transilvania and was annexed until 1918, to the Kingdom of Hungary &quot;comitatus&quot; of Szolnok-Doboka. 

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of Gherla in December 1918, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The town officially became part of the territory ceded to the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon. During the interwar period, the city was the headquarters of plasa Gherla, within Someș County, after which it became part of Ținutul Crișuri.

In the wake of the Second Vienna Award of August 30, 1940, the territory of Northern Transylvania (of which the city of Gherla was part) reverted to the Kingdom of Hungary. In early September, the Hungarian administration was installed, and proceeded to take discriminatory measures against Romanians and Jews, forcing many Romanians to take refuge in Romania. Gherla had a significant Jewish population which was decimated during the Holocaust, due to Horthyst regime and the policies of Ferenc Szálasi after September 1, 1944. Towards the end of World War II, however, the town was taken back from Hungarian and German troops by Romanian and Soviet forces in October 1944. After 1950, the city became the headquarters of Gherla raion within the Cluj Region. Following the administrative reform of 1968, Gherla became part of Cluj County.

After the war, most of the remaining Jewish population left the city. The Gherla Synagogue and the Holocaust Memorial Monument are visited by tourists from many countries. The town is also often visited by Orthodox pilgrims on their way to the nearby village of Nicula and Nicula Monastery.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2021 Romanian census, Gherla has a population of 19,873, a decrease of 5.3% from the previous census. At the 2011 census, there were 20,982 people living within the city; of those, 15,952 (76.0%) were Romanians, 3,435 (16.4%) Hungarians, 735 (3.5%) Roma, and 61 (0.3%) others, including 16 Germans (more specifically Transylvanian Saxons).

<text>The Royal Thai Army or RTA (; ) is the army of Thailand and the oldest and largest branch of the Royal Thai Armed Forces.

==History==
===Origin===
The Royal Thai Army is responsible for protecting the kingdom&#x27;s sovereignty. The army was formed in 1874, partly as a response to new security threats following the 1855 Bowring Treaty with Britain, which opened the country for international trade.

===Current===
In modern era, the army has a long history of coups d&#x27;état and coup attempts. Its leadership continues to see coup-making as one role of the army.

On 22 May 2014 the army deposed the government, appointed military officers to the national assembly, and on 21 August 2014 they elected the army&#x27;s Commander in Chief, General Prayut Chan-o-cha, as prime minister. The general retired October 2014 to concentrate on political reform which he said would take at least a year, following which he promised national elections would be held.

The existence of an information warfare unit participating in a cyber campaign against government critics was leaked to the public in late February 2020.
In 2020 Twitter shut down a network of accounts which were engaged in information warfare. According to Twitter &quot;Our investigation uncovered a network of accounts partaking in information operations that we can reliably link to the Royal Thai Army (RTA).&quot; The operation had targeted the political opposition within Thailand. The Thai Army denied that they had been involved in the disinformation operation.

===Army components and control===

The number of army generals is unclear. One point of comparison: as of 1 November 2019, the US Army had 322 general officers for a force of 471,990 troops. Saiyud Kerdphol is Thailand&#x27;s oldest general, a veteran of World War II and Korea who retired in 1983 as supreme commander. During his tenure, general officer numbers were based on the number of troops under their command. , only 150–200 four-star generals occupy command positions. Speaking on the topic of army manpower, Saiyud declared that, &quot;Everybody being a general is unbelievable. Full generals don&#x27;t have a seat to sit in or a job to do.&quot;

===Command and control===
The commanders-in-chief of the Royal Thai Army (ผู้บัญชาการทหารบกไทย) is considered the most powerful position in the Royal Thai Armed Forces. With effect from 1 October 2024, the commander will be General Pana Klaewblaudtuk.

The creation of the 15th Infantry Division was announced in January 2005. Defence Minister, General Samphan Boonyanan, was quoted as saying that the new unit, dubbed the &quot;Development Division&quot;, would not be a combat unit for fighting Islamic militants, but rather its main mission would be to assist local citizens and develop the region. The military will not ignore its general function of providing safety for the citizens of the region, he added. He said that troops for the new division would undergo training to give them a good understanding of local residents, the vast majority of whom are ethnic Malay Muslims. The division is in fact a transformation of the Pranburi-based 16th Infantry Division. It will now be headquartered at Fort Ingkhayutthaborihan in Pattani, complete with its battalions and companies of military police and communications and aviation personnel, he said. It will also have three separate infantry battalions, one each in Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat. Each battalion will include three companies of medical, engineering, and psychological warfare personnel, he said. The government will allocate a budget of more than 18 billion baht for the division over the next four years.

The 15th Infantry Division is being established as a permanent force to handle security problems in the Deep South. The division is based in Pattani and is expected to have a combined force of around 10,000. The establishment of this new division, approved by the government in 2005, has yet to be completed. As of this writing, some 7,000 troops deployed in the Deep South are affiliated to this division.&quot; In 2012, two new combat formations had been approved by the thai government. The new 7th Infantry Division is based at Mae Rim, near Chiang Mai, and the new 3rd Cavalry Division is based at Khon Kaen.

===Tactical units===

The army is organised into the following formations:
* Nine infantry divisions (including 16 tank battalions)
* One armoured division
* Three cavalry divisions (light armoured divisions)
* One Special Warfare Command trained and equipped for small unit Special forces and airborne operations

The Army Tactical Level Advanced Simulation (ATLAS) is an interactive, distributed, constructive simulation used to conduct military Command Post Exercises (CPX). ATLAS displays a continuous terrain model, incorporates HLA 1516, and displays 1:250,000 and 1:50,000 maps and satellite imagery. ATLAS was developed between 2002 and 2005 through co-operation with the Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC).

Army Medical Department (AMED) () belongs to the service segment of the Royal Thai Army. It is in charge of medical affairs, and providing medical care, both in the field and on base, training personnel in research and agriculture and supervising the other medical divisions within the Royal Thai Army.

**A separate airfield within the Lopburi complex (around 3 km south of Sa Pran Nak) houses the 5th Aircraft Maintenance Company. This unit is responsible for maintenance and storage of army aircraft and helicopters.
** The 5th Infantry Division operates the following aviation assets from a small airfield within the army reserve at Nakhon Si Thammarat (not at the airport): two Bell 206B-3s (serial numbers 4382 and 4427), three Schweizer TH-300Cs (serial numbers 1371, 1372, and 1373) and two Maule MX-7s (serial numbers 114 and 115). A detachment of helicopters can be found here from the Air Mobility Companies based at Lopburi.

==Businesses and infrastructure==
The army owns more than 30 golf courses nationwide. The army also owns boxing stadium, 100 petrol stations, racecourses, hotels, retail and coffee shops, and radio and television airwaves (by one count, the armed forces have ownership in 537 radio and TV stations). In early 2020, the army entered an agreement with the Finance Ministry to turn over to the ministry the management of businesses unrelated to the army&#x27;s mission. In a related move, army commander General Apirat Kongsompong decreed that retired generals must move out of army-owned housing to free space for serving officers. , about 100 retired generals and colonels inhabit army accommodations. Some ex-generals, like PM Prayut Chan-o-cha and deputy PM Prawit Wongsuwan were exempted immediately from eviction because of their &quot;contribution to society&quot;. The Thai Defence Ministry position is that there is no law prohibiting retired officers from occupying military housing.

In January 2021, the RTA signed a memorandum of understanding with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) to study the feasibility of constructing solar farms on 4.5 million rai of army land to generate 30,000 megawatts of electricity. Following up, on 22 February 2021 a meeting was called by the President of Royal Thai Army Radio and Television Channel 5 with energy firms interested in winning a piece of what is projected to be a 600 billion baht project. The Energy Ministry was not represented at the meeting. Critics have questioned why the army is involved in energy procurement, in contravention of existing regulations, and why Thailand needs more electricity when it already has 59% reserve capacity and more capacity under construction.

<text>Estação Central do Brasil () is a major train station in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. The station is located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, along the Avenida Presidente Vargas and across from the Campo de Santana park. It is one of the most famous train stations in Brazil, and was previously called &quot;Estação Dom Pedro II&quot;, a name by which it is still also known unofficially.

The station is the last stop of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s suburban railway network, as well as a hub for connection with the city subway and a bus station. Central do Brasil was also a preeminent stop in the interstate Central do Brasil railroad, which linked Rio de Janeiro with São Paulo and Minas Gerais, though the railroad is now deactivated.

The station opened in 1858, and the current station building in the Art Deco style opened in 1943.

== History ==

The construction of the first station in the centre of Rio de Janeiro began in 1855, to serve as the terminus of the new &quot;Estrada de Ferro Dom Pedro II&quot; (&quot;Dom Pedro II Railway&quot;) which was to connect the city, then the capital of Brazil, with the provinces of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. The location chosen for this station was the Campo de Santana, an area close to the city center and at the time the site of many government buildings. Its construction necessitated the demolition of the &quot;Igreja de Santa Ana&quot; (&quot;Church of Saint Anne&quot;) dating from 1735, but a wooden image of the saint, originating from Portugal, can still be found in a chapel at the station. The station, then known as the &quot;Estação do Campo&quot; due to its location, was opened along with the first section of the railway line from Rio de Janeiro to Queimados in March 1858 in the presence of Emperor Pedro II, Empress Teresa Christine and the bishop. The name of the station was shortly afterwards changed to &quot;Estação da Corte&quot;, in reference to the Imperial Court.
Already in 1870, the station was renovated and enlarged following a project by Jorge Grademaker Grunewald, in order to accommodate the growing number of passengers living in the new suburban districts served by the train. The project preserved the appearance of the old station building with a central building flanked by two large side wings and had a station clock in the centre. From 1876 to 1880, new warehouses were built under the direction of Francisco Pereira Passos. On 21 November 1879, electric lighting was installed in the station as a first for a public building in Brazil. In 1906, one of the wings was destroyed by fire.

In 1908, at the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the inauguration of the station, projects were launched to build a new station, which, however, were not carried out. In 1919, other projects for a new station were launched due to the development of coffee production at the beginning of the 20th century. Another new project was presented in 1922 by the architects Samuel and Cristiano das Neves, but was not developed. On 2 December 1925, by decree of the then President of Brazil Artur da Silva Bernardes, the station was renamed &quot;Estaçao Dom Pedro II&quot; (&quot;Dom Pedro II Station&quot;) in honour of Emperor Pedro II at the occasion of the centenary of his birth in 1825.
Finally, work on a new station started in 1936. The cornerstone was laid on 29 March 1936, but the project by Roberto Magno de Carvalho was largely modified after the start of the construction. From 1937, the new authoritarian regime in Brazil, the Estado Novo, undertook major works in Rio de Janeiro, in particular the construction of new buildings for public institutions, and the widening and opening of streets, including the creation of the Avenida Presidente Vargas and ambitions for a much larger train station. The task of preparing a new building project for the station was entrusted to the architectural firm of the British architect Robert Prentice which concluded the altered project on 29 November 1937. The old station building was demolished in 1939, and the new station building in Art Deco style (which also served as the seat of the &quot;Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil&quot;) opened in 1943, and was completed in 1945.

On 5 March 1979, the station was connected to Line 1 of the Rio de Janeiro Metro.

After passenger traffic on medium and long-distance routes in Brazil was practically stopped in the 1990s, Central do Brasil now serves as a terminus and hub for Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s suburban trains operated by SuperVia.

Since 2014, the station has also been served by the Teleférico da Providência, a gondola lift service connecting it with the neighborhood of Providência.

== Architecture ==
The Art Deco-style building features a twenty-eight-story tower and a large four-sided clock. The station is visible from almost every part of the city and at the time of construction it was the tallest building in South America and the tallest reinforced concrete structure in the world.

<doc id="1230374" wikidata="Q3486169" url="?curid=1230374" title="Louis M. Goldsborough">
<text>Louis Malesherbes Goldsborough (February 18, 1805 – February 20, 1877) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. He held several sea commands during the Civil War, including that of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. He was also noted for contributions to nautical scientific research.

His younger brother, John R. Goldsborough, was also a U.S. Navy officer who served during the Civil War and who later became a commodore.

==Biography==
Louis Malesherbes Goldsborough was born in Washington, D.C., in 1805, the son of a chief clerk at the United States Department of the Navy. He was appointed midshipman in the United States Navy by Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton on June 28, 1812. At the time of his appointment, he was seven years old, and Goldsborough did not actually begin serving until February 13, 1816, when he reported for duty at the Washington Navy Yard.

In 1831 Goldsborough married Elizabeth Wirt, daughter of William Wirt, U.S. Attorney General from 1817 to 1829. Together, they had three children: William, Louis, and Elizabeth.

In 1833, after helping lead German emigrants to Wirt&#x27;s Estates near Monticello, Florida, Goldsborough took leave from the Navy to command a steamboat expedition, and later mounted volunteers in the Seminole War.

==Naval service==
During the Aegean Anti-Piracy Campaign, Goldsborough led a four-boat night expedition from &quot;Porpoise&quot; in October 1827 to rescue British merchant brig &quot;Comet&quot; from Mediterranean pirates. In 1830 he was appointed first officer in charge of the newly created Depot of Charts and Instruments at Washington, the crude beginning of the United States Hydrographic Office. Goldsborough suggested creation of the depot and initiated the collection and centralization of the instruments, books and charts that were scattered among several Navy yards. After two years he was relieved by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes.

After cruising the Pacific in the frigate &quot;United States&quot;, he participated in the bombardment of Veracruz in &quot;Ohio&quot; during the Mexican–American War. He served consecutively as: commander of a detachment in the expedition against Tuxpan; senior officer of a commission which explored California and Oregon (1849–1850); superintendent of the United States Naval Academy (1853–1857); and commander of the Brazil Squadron (1859–1861).

===Civil War service===
Goldsborough was given command of the Atlantic Blockading Squadron in September 1861, relieving Flag Officer Silas H. Stringham. In October of that year the Atlantic squadron was split into the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and South Atlantic Blockading Squadron; Goldsborough took command of the North squadron, and Flag Officer Samuel Francis DuPont assumed command of the South squadron. On January 3, 1862, both officers were promoted to the newly created rank of Flag Officer (equivalent to the rank of Commodore which would be created 5 months later). During his command of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, which he commanded from its inception to September 1862, he led his fleet off North Carolina, where in cooperation with troops under General Ambrose Burnside, he captured Roanoke Island and destroyed a small Confederate fleet.

====Peninsula campaign====
After aiding the capture of Roanoke Island, Goldsborough and his command were sent to Hampton Roads at the request of Major General George B. McClellan to help protect Union forces landing on the Virginia Peninsula at the start of the Peninsula Campaign. Goldsborough refused to be placed under McClellan&#x27;s direct command, telling Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox that he would instead &quot;cooperate&quot; with McClellan. After sending six of his vessels to attack the Gloucester Point batteries, Goldsborough withdrew them, saying the area was too dangerous for his ships—even though none of them sustained any damage—and fearful of a return appearance by CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, which had laid waste to a Union naval force in Hampton Roads while Goldsborough was at Roanoke Island.

At the start of the Seven Days Battles, Goldsborough was asked again, this time by President Abraham Lincoln, to come to McClellan&#x27;s aid. Goldsborough continued to hold back his fleet, forcing Lincoln to accept a recommendation by Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to detach ships under Goldsborough&#x27;s command and place them under Commodore Charles Wilkes, who as a lieutenant had relieved Goldsborough at the Depot of Charts and Instruments (see above), and who would report directly to Welles. This move, coupled with newspaper accounts critical of the Navy, so seriously hurt Goldsborough that he requested that he be relieved. He was promoted to rear admiral in August 1862, and in September passed command of the squadron to Acting Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee. Goldsborough would finish the war performing administrative duties in Washington, D.C.

==Post-Civil War service and death==
In June 1865, Goldsborough became the first commander of the European Squadron, formerly the Mediterranean Squadron. In 1868, Goldsborough returned to Washington and took command of the Washington Navy Yard, a position he held until he retired in 1873.

Rear Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough died in Washington, D.C., on February 20, 1877.

<doc id="1230380" wikidata="Q4922427" url="?curid=1230380" title="Black populism">
<text>Black populism was a broad-based, independent political movement started by Black Americans following the end of the Reconstruction era. The movement began among Black agricultural workers as a response to Jim Crow laws. They sought better pay and labor protections, increased funding for Black schools, criminal justice reform, and increased participation of Black Americans in politics.

==Beginnings==

Between 1886 and 1898 black farmers, sharecroppers, and agrarian laborers organized their communities to combat the rising tide of Jim Crow laws. As Black Populism asserted itself and grew into a regional force, it met fierce resistance from the white planter and business elite that, through the Democratic Party and its affiliated network of courts, militias, sheriffs, and newspapers, maintained tight control of the region. Violence against black Populism was organized through the Ku Klux Klan, among other white terrorist organizations designed to halt or reverse the advance of black civil and political rights.

==Goals==

Despite opposition, black Populists carried out a wide range of activities:

*Establishing farming exchanges
*Raising money for schools
*Publishing newspapers
*Lobbying for better legislation
*Mounting boycotts against agricultural trusts
*Carrying out strikes for better wages
*Protesting the convict-lease system and lynching
*Demanding Black jurors in cases involving black defendants
*Promoting local political reforms and federal supervision of elections
*Running independent and fusion campaigns.

Black Populism found early expression in various agrarian organizations, including the Colored Agricultural Wheels, the southern Knights of Labor, the Cooperative Workers of America, and the Colored Farmers&#x27; Alliance. However, facing the limitations in attempting to implement their reforms absent of engaging the electoral process, Black Populists helped to launch the People&#x27;s Party and used the then left-of-center Republican Party in fusion campaigns. (Today though, after the Republican Party moved to the right, and the Democratic Party in the South was abandoned by the White Populist Dixiecrats who had opposed integration in the 1960s, most African Americans who vote cast ballots for Democratic Party candidates).

==Resistance and failure==

By the late 1890s, propaganda campaigns warning of a “second Reconstruction” and “Negro rule,” physical intimidation, violence, and assassinations of leaders and foot soldiers led to the movement&#x27;s downfall. A key figure in the attack on Black Populism was Ben Tillman, the leader of South Carolina&#x27;s white farmers&#x27; movement. Southern Populists knew that they had only two possible alternatives in the fight against the ruling Bourbon Democrats. They must choose between trying to win the Negro vote or working to eliminate it entirely. Tillman and his followers in South Carolina sought the latter method. They were completely reactionary on the Negro question and stood with the Bourbons in disregarding the principles of the Fifteenth Amendment.

Elsewhere, the populists sought to win Negro votes, either through fusion with the Republican minority or through the raising of issues with a broad appeal to the Negro farmers. It was no accident that in the South the third-party movement was strongest in those states where it sought not only black votes but active black support.

The notion that African Americans had somehow betrayed populism would haunt the Georgia People&#x27;s Party from the very beginning. Populists had realized the political importance of blacks. Of the state&#x27;s forty thousand Republicans voters, a considerable majority were former bondsmen. If the white votes were to split, they might decide the outcome of any state election. Populists faced the dilemma of needing to find a way to court the black votes without losing the whites, while also preventing whites from supporting the &quot;negro party.&quot; The Party decided that it must accept the risk and court the black vote. This strategy contained a degree of precedent in state politics: in the 1870s and 1880s, democrats and independents had sometimes used the same device when the white votes split. In those days many whites were willing to allow African American men the ballot, especially when it could be sometimes bought for so little.

Black populism was destroyed, marking the end of organized political resistance to the return of white supremacy in the South in the late 19th century. Nevertheless, black populism stood as the largest independent political uprising in the South since the &quot;general strike&quot; during the Civil War, until the modern Civil Rights Movement.

<doc id="1230388" wikidata="Q3737707" url="?curid=1230388" title="Tartu College">
<text>Tartu College is a not for profit student residence on the north side of Bloor Street West, just east of Madison Avenue, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Most of its residents are students of the University of Toronto.

Tartu College was built in 1970, two years after its sister building, the David A. Croll Apartments (originally Rochdale College), was built a block away on the opposite side of the street in 1968. Both buildings were designed by architects Elmar Tampõld and John Wells (who had earlier constructed the Charles Street apartments at Bay Street and Bloor Street). Like the Rochdale building, it is an example of brutalist architectural principles, and serves as a nostalgic reminder of the 1960s culture during which both buildings emerged.

It was named after the city of Tartu, Estonia, and was originally built as an undergraduate student co-op with a library, archive, and study centre serving the Estonian-Canadian community.

==Tartu Institute==
Tartu College operates the Tartu Institute, which was established on 9 February 1971. The institute deals mostly with activities related to Estonian diaspora in Canada.

<doc id="1230389" wikidata="Q161041" url="?curid=1230389" title="Jonathan Spector">
<text>Jonathan Michael Paul Spector (born March 1, 1986) is an American former soccer player who played as a defender. In his 16-year career playing first-team soccer he played over 400 games for club and country, and helped the United States win the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2007. He earned 36 caps for the United States national team. He is now the Head of Scouting for MLS side Atlanta United.

Spector started his professional career in England when he was signed by Manchester United as a teenager, but rarely appeared for the club. He played on loan at Charlton Athletic, then in 2006 joined West Ham United, for whom he played over 100 games before he was released at the end of the 2010–11 season. He then spent five and a half seasons with Birmingham City. Spector then played for MLS club Orlando City and had a short spell with Scottish club Hibernian. He retired as a player in 2019.

Although he began playing as a striker during his youth career, Spector was converted into a defender as a professional. He most commonly played as a right-back, although he occasionally appeared across the defensive line and in central midfield.

==Early life==
Spector was born and grew up in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights, Illinois the youngest of 4 children. He is Lutheran but his Paternal Grandfather was Jewish. His father is of Russian, English and Irish ancestry, and his mother was born in Siegen, Germany; as a result of this, Spector has a German passport, which allowed him to play in England without needing a work permit. Spector&#x27;s grandfather, Art Spector, was an NBA basketball player and the first player to be signed by the Boston Celtics in 1946, which led to him becoming known as the &quot;Original Celtic&quot;. He died in June 1987, when Jonathan was 15 months old.

Spector attended St. Peter Lutheran Junior High School and St. Viator High School, where he played high school soccer. He was an Amateur Athletic Union basketball standout. He started his club soccer career with Schwaben AC in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, before joining national power Chicago Sockers (2003). He also played youth soccer with Chicago Fire (2003) and Manchester United (2003). He graduated from the United States Soccer Federation&#x27;s Bradenton Academy at the age of 17 in the summer of 2003.

==Club career==

===Manchester United===
Spector was discovered by a Manchester United scout while playing for the American Under-17 squad at the Milk Cup in 2003. Originally a striker, Spector was lined up in defense due to injuries for a game the scout had attended to scout other players. Impressed by Spector&#x27;s defending, the scout alerted the club.

Spector joined United in summer 2003. He won the club&#x27;s Young Player of the Year award for the 2003–04 season. He made his first appearance for the first team in the FA Community Shield match against Arsenal in August 2004. In December, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson announced that Spector would be loaned out to fellow Premier League side Blackburn Rovers for the remainder of the season. However, Ferguson was soon forced to postpone the deal due to an injury crisis in the United defense. The injury crisis continued and Spector was not able to make his loan move before the transfer window closed on January 31, 2005. Before the start of the 2005–06 season, Spector went on a season-long loan to another Premiership club, Charlton Athletic, to obtain more first-team experience. He finished the season with 16 starts and eight substitute appearances.

===West Ham United===

Spector was signed by manager Alan Pardew for West Ham United in a deal initially worth £500,000 in June 2006, ending his association with Manchester United after eight appearances. He made his debut for the club in the first round defeat of the UEFA Cup against Palermo in Sicily on September 28, going on to make twenty-eight appearances in all competitions in the 2006–07 season. Spector had initially been brought as backup to the West Ham defense, but he had an extended run of games due to injury problems and his ability to play anywhere in the back four with equal ease. On November 10, 2007, it was believed that Spector had scored his first professional goal, in the 5–0 away win at Derby County. However, this was later credited as an own goal by Derby&#x27;s fellow American international Eddie Lewis.

He missed most of the 2008–09 season due to injuries, but following the departure of Lucas Neill, Spector played in 27 of a possible 38 games in the 2009–10 season. Many of his appearances that year came at left-back, despite being a right footed player. When Gianfranco Zola left, new manager Avram Grant began deploying Spector in the midfield. He scored his first goals for West Ham and first in English soccer, scoring twice in a 4–0 home win over former club Manchester United in the League Cup on November 30, 2010. He scored his first Premier League goal in the 2–2 draw away to Everton later that season. Spector was released by West Ham in June 2011.

===Birmingham City===

Spector signed a two-year contract with Championship club Birmingham City in August 2011, four days before the opening of the league season. He made his debut in Birmingham&#x27;s first match in major European competition for nearly 50 years, the Europa League play-off round first leg against Portuguese club Nacional, which finished goalless. Three days later, he played his first league game in English soccer at a level below the Premier League, in a 3–1 defeat at Middlesbrough. Spector was played in central midfield for the first few months of his Birmingham City career, a position he said he enjoyed, and filled in at right-back in the European matches as Birmingham failed by a point to progress past the group stage. Later in the season, he was used more frequently at right-back, at the expense of captain Stephen Carr, and occasionally at left-back. The &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; end-of-season review viewed his versatility as &quot;an invaluable asset&quot;. He missed the last two months of the season with a torn thigh muscle, returning for Birmingham&#x27;s unsuccessful play-off campaign only to suffer a recurrence of the injury which was to keep him out of the summer&#x27;s international program.

Carr was injured in the final pre-season game, and the only alternative right-back was the teenaged Will Packwood. Despite having taken no part in the warm-up games, Spector returned to action in the opening match of the 2012–13 season, as a second-half substitute for Packwood, and started the next, though &quot;short of match sharpness, he was rusty and had a torrid time of it&quot;. He scored his first goal for Birmingham in a 3–2 defeat by Coventry City in the League Cup on August 28. New manager Lee Clark preferred his &quot;drive and energy&quot; in midfield, with right-back duties shared between Packwood, loan signing Paul Caddis and others, but injuries soon forced his return to full-back. Spector was restricted to 10 appearances in the second half of the season by a succession of minor injuries, culminating in ankle damage sustained in early April that kept him out for what remained of the campaign. Although several senior players were released at the end of the season, Spector agreed a further two-year contract, which he signed after he and wife Olivia Metzinger returned from honeymoon.

Two weeks later, Spector fractured his cheekbone in five places during a pre-season game. He returned to Birmingham&#x27;s midfield for the 3–2 defeat by Leicester City in late August, and a month later was involved in an eventful match at Queens Park Rangers. He had a goal disallowed shortly before QPR took the lead, and after 79 minutes was yellow-carded for diving in the penalty area when it appeared that Richard Dunne had tripped him. In mid-October, he tore a thigh muscle in training. This time, the injury kept him out for four months; he returned in mid-February 2014, and was a regular starter from then on, as Birmingham avoided relegation to League One on goal difference via a stoppage-time equalizer in the last match of the season.

Again, Spector began the 2014–15 season as a regular starter, tore a thigh muscle a couple of months in, and missed the next four months. By the time he regained fitness, Gary Rowett had replaced Clark as manager, Caddis was the right-back of choice, and Michael Morrison and Paul Robinson had established themselves at center-back, which Spector had told Rowett was his position of choice. When Morrison injured an ankle in late January, he came back into the team in that position, initially with Robinson, then partnering loanee Rob Kiernan, and finishing the season, after a minor injury that coincided with Morrison&#x27;s return to fitness, playing alongside the latter.

Although Spector had hinted that he had been away from home and wider family long enough, and there was reported interest from Major League Soccer clubs, he confirmed that he and his wife felt settled in Birmingham, and signed a new two-year contract. He went through the 2015–16 season injury free. He alternated at starting center-back with the veteran Robinson, and although he enjoyed no more onfield time than in either of the preceding two seasons, he was almost ever-present in the matchday squad. After Rowett decided that Paul Caddis&#x27;s fitness levels were too low, Spector began the 2016–17 season at right-back. He continued in that position until and after Gianfranco Zolawho had managed Spector at West Hamreplaced Rowett in December. By January 2017, Spector had decided he wanted to return to the United States. With the emergence of Josh Dacres-Cogley, who played at right back while Spector served a suspension in November, and the arrival of Emilio Nsue, Zola felt able to accede to his request. He made a total of 179 appearances in all competitions for Birmingham.

===Orlando City===
Birmingham City canceled Spector&#x27;s contract by mutual consent, and on January 24, 2017, he signed with Orlando City of Major League Soccer. On March 5, he made his Major League Soccer debut for Orlando City in their first game of the 2017 season that resulted in a 1–0 win over New York City FC and saw Spector named to the MLS Team of the Week. He was named club captain prior to the start of the 2018 season following the departure of Kaká. After a season mostly spent battling against injuries, the club announced they were declining his contract option, making him a free agent. He played 38 games for the club over two years.

===Hibernian===
Scottish Premiership club Hibernian signed Spector on a short-term contract in March 2019. Spector was released by Hibernian in May 2019, having made one appearance, in an Edinburgh derby win against Hearts.

He officially announced his retirement as an active player on August 11, 2019. In his 16-year career playing first-team football, he played over 400 games for club and country, and helped the United States win the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2007.

Later that month, he was appointed the Head of International Player Recruitment and Development for MLS side Atlanta United FC.

==International career==
In 2003, Spector played for the United States national team at the World Under-17 Championship in Finland and earned his first cap for the senior team on November 17, 2004, in a World Cup qualifier against Jamaica.

In 2005, Spector was part of the United States Under-20 team at the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship in the Netherlands and as the 2005–06 Premier League season approached its conclusion, was considered a long shot to be included in the United States World Cup squad. However, a shoulder injury sustained on April 17 in a game against Portsmouth ended his chances of playing at the World Cup.

Spector was a member of the United States team that beat Mexico 2–1 in the CONCACAF Gold Cup Final in Chicago in June 2007. However, during the final, he had to be substituted by Frankie Simek as he collided heads with Mexican midfielder Andrés Guardado. Immediately after the substitution Benny Feilhaber struck the winning volley.

Following injuries to Steve Cherundolo and Frankie Hejduk, Spector was included in the United States roster for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup and took the chance to cement his place in the national team, starting at right-back for the entire tournament. He assisted Clint Dempsey to score a vital goal against Egypt in the last group stage match as the United States scraped through to the semifinals on the basis of goals scored. In the final against Brazil, Spector once again assisted Dempsey in scoring the opening goal with a similar long cross from the right flank.

Having returned from a long injury lay-off, Spector was ever present at right-back for the remaining 2010 World Cup fourth round qualifiers in 2009 although he has also been partnered with captain Carlos Bocanegra in central defense occasionally due to Oguchi Onyewu&#x27;s long-term injury. He was rested for the United States&#x27; last qualifying match against Costa Rica on October 14 as qualification had already been secured and was recalled for friendlies in November and March. Coach Bob Bradley included him in the final 23-man squad for the World Cup although he did not appear in any games. Later in 2010, Spector was a starting right-back in friendlies against Brazil and Colombia.

Spector received his first call-up to the senior national team in 18 months when he was added to the squad ahead of September 2015 friendlies against Peru and Brazil; he played in the second game, as a second-half substitute in a 4–1 defeat. He earned 36 caps for the United States between 2004 and 2015.

<text>The National Tramway Museum (trading as Crich Tramway Village) is a tram museum located at Crich (), in the Peak District of Derbyshire, England. The museum contains over 80 (mainly British) trams built between 1873 and 1982 and is set within a recreated period village containing a working pub, café, old-style sweetshop and tram depots. The museum&#x27;s collection of trams runs through the village-setting with visitors transported out into the local countryside and back and is operated by the Tramway Museum Society, a registered charity.

The Crich Tramway Village remains an independent charity, which receives no funding from the state or local government and relies on the voluntary contribution made by members of the Tramway Museum Society and its visitors.

==History of the museum==
===History of the site===

George Stephenson, the great railway pioneer, had a close connection with Crich and the present (2008) tramway follows part of the mineral railway he built to link the quarry with Ambergate.

While building the North Midland Railway from Derby to Rotherham and Leeds, Stephenson had found rich coal seams in the Clay Cross area and he saw a new business opportunity. Crich was already well known for the quality of the limestone and Stephenson recognised that he could use the local coal and limestone to produce burnt lime for agricultural purposes, and then use the new railway to distribute it. Cliff Quarry, where the museum is now located, was acquired by Stephenson&#x27;s company and to link the quarry with limekilns he had built at Ambergate, Stephenson constructed a gauge line – apparently the first metre gauge railway in the world. Stephenson lived the last 10 years of his life in Chesterfield, often bringing visitors to Crich to see the mineral railway. He died in 1848 and is buried in Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield.

Cliff Quarry remained in use until it closed in 1957/8, and shortly afterwards part of it was acquired for use by the museum. Other parts of the quarry, now known as Crich Quarry, reopened in the 1960s and was then operated by RMC and Tarmac. In 2000 ownership of the active quarry site was transferred to Bardon Aggregates, who closed the quarry in 2010. It remains closed.

===Tramway Museum Society===

In the period after the Second World War, when most of the remaining British tramways were in decline or actually closing, the first event in the history of the National Tramway Museum took place. A group of enthusiasts on a farewell tour of Southampton Tramways in August 1948 decided to purchase one of the open top trams on which they had ridden. For the sum of £10 they purchased number 45 – now included in collection at the museum. From this purchase grew the idea of a working museum devoted to operating tramcars. From the original group developed the Tramway Museum Society, established in 1955, incorporated as a company limited by guarantee in 1962, and recognised as an educational charity in 1963.

===Acquisition of the site===

After a sustained search across the country, in 1959 the society&#x27;s attention was drawn to the then derelict limestone quarry at Crich in Derbyshire, from which members of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society were recovering track from Stephenson&#x27;s mineral railway for their pioneering preservation project in Wales. After a tour of the quarry, members of the society agreed to lease – and later purchase – part of the site and buildings. Over the years, by the efforts of the society members, a representative collection of tramcars was brought together and restored, tramway equipment was acquired, a working tramway was constructed and depots and workshops were built. Recognising that tramcars did not operate in limestone quarries, the society agreed in 1967 to create around the tramway the kind of streetscape through which the trams had run and thus the concept of the Crich Tramway Village was born. Members then turned their attention to collecting items of street furniture and even complete buildings, which were then adapted to house the Museum&#x27;s collections of books, photographs and archives.

==The museum&#x27;s site==

The museum site is made up of a number of different areas, with the museum&#x27;s tramway passing either through or adjacent to all of them. The museum&#x27;s main entrance delivers visitors to the Victoria Park area, but the trams start their journey at Town End, a walk or short tram ride under the Bowes Lyon Bridge and down Period Street. 

===Period Street===

The running line of the tramway starts from a stub terminus at &quot;Town End&quot; where outbound trams board passengers, having first disembarked inbound passengers at &quot;Stephenson Place&quot;. The first of line is double track, laid in a setted street, and this is known as the Period Street. It has broad footpaths on both sides and is flanked by a number of old buildings and street furniture elements. The street scene is closed off by the Bowes-Lyon Bridge, which the tramway passes under.

Amongst the buildings and furniture in the street are:

* the grade II listed 1763 facade of the Derby Assembly Rooms, moved to the site in 1975–76. The modern building behind this facade houses a number of small exhibitions and the Tramway Museum Society&#x27;s library.
* the original workshop of Stephenson&#x27;s railway, now housing the Stephenson Discovery Centre.
* the Red Lion pub, relocated from Stoke on Trent and still serving its original purpose, together with the museum&#x27;s café.
* a cast iron and glass tram shelter, thought to originate in Birmingham, at the Town End tram stop
* a Bundy clock, originally used in West Bromwich to regulate departure times of trams from termini.
* a cast iron urinal, originally located at the Erleigh Road terminus of Reading Corporation Tramways.
* a police box dating from the 1930s and a police call post dating from the 1920s. Both were formerly used by the London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police and are grade II listed.

===Stephenson Workshop and Discovery Centre===

One of the few buildings on the site that predate the creation of the museum and are in their original place, the Stephenson Workshop was built in the 19th century and was used as a smithy and wagon works for George Stephenson&#x27;s metre gauge mineral railway. Originally known as the Stone Workshop, the building has been fully restored and is now home to a state of the art learning facility on the ground floor and the Stephenson Discovery Centre on the first floor.

The Stephenson Discovery Centre explains the early history of the museum site, including the story of George Stephenson and his acquisition of Cliff Quarry and construction of the mineral railway. It also describes how overcrowding in expanding towns and cities paved the way for in the introductions of trams to Britain in the 19th century. A modern glass bridge from the upper floor provides access to the viewing gallery of the tram workshop (see below).

===Tram Depot and Exhibition Hall===

The tram depot is situated at the further end of the museum&#x27;s Period Street, just before it passes under the Bowes-Lyon Bridge. The tram depot houses most of the museum&#x27;s fleet of trams, including the running fleet when not in operation, other than those displayed in the exhibition hall, which faces the depot across the depot yard. The depot has 18 tracks, with each track able to accommodate several trams. The first 10 tracks are directly accessible from the depot yard, while tracks 11 to 18 are accessed via a traverser, which also provides rail access to the exhibition hall.

The tram depot includes a workshop, on tracks 1 to 3, used for the maintenance of the tram fleet. This has a viewing gallery, accessed by a glass bridge from the upper floor of the Stephenson Discovery Centre, which allows visitors to watch the work going on below and displays small exhibits relating to this work.

The exhibition hall presents the ‘Century of Trams’ exhibition, telling the story of a hundred years of tramway development, from 1860 – 1960, taking in horse trams, steam trams and electric trams. The story is told through the display of number of the museum&#x27;s tram cars, together with interpretive panels, audio sounds to represent each decade of the timeline, and interactive displays.

===Bowes-Lyon Bridge and Victoria Park===

The Bowes-Lyon Bridge spans the end of the museum&#x27;s period street, and provides both a vantage point and a visual closure to the recreated urban part of the museum. The bridge deck is constructed in cast iron and dates from 1844, when it was installed at the Bowes-Lyon Estate in St Paul&#x27;s Walden, Hertfordshire. The bridge was donated to the museum in 1971, and subsequently re-erected at its present site. Embedded in the deck of the Bowes-Lyon Bridge is a stretch of horse-tram track, demonstrating the lightweight nature of such track when compared to that used by the electric trams on the lower level.

Immediately to the north and west of the bridge is Victoria Park, a recreated Victorian era public park. This has, as its centrepiece, a bandstand that was erected here in 1978 but was previously at Longford Park in Stretford, Greater Manchester. From the park, a path leads to the museum&#x27;s Woodland Walk and Sculpture Trail. Alongside the park is a tram stop, served by both inbound and outbound trams and named after the park. To the east of the park, on the opposite side of the tramway, is the museum entrance.

===Wakebridge and Glory Mine===

Just past the Victoria Park tram stop, the museum&#x27;s running track transitions from grooved tram track set in a road surface to sleeper track and becomes single track. The line passes between woodland to the west and the now disused Cliff Quarry to the east, before arriving at the Wakebridge passing loop and tram stop.

The stop has a selection of shelters and simple buildings, including the Birmingham Tram Shelter, the Bradford Cabmans Shelter, and the Octogon, together with the line&#x27;s electrical sub-station. A path leads to the museum&#x27;s Woodland Walk and Sculpture Trail. Adjacent to the stop, the Peak District Mines Historical Society has created an exhibition of mining equipment, including the mouth of a drift mine with a battery powered locomotive coming out of it, and a shop selling mineral samples, books and gemstones. 

Beyond Wakebridge, the line runs along an exposed hillside with vistas across the valley of the River Derwent, which is here part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. While now largely rural, this valley was one of the cradles of the Industrial Revolution, where the modern factory system was introduced during the 18th century to take advantage of Richard Arkwright&#x27;s invention of the water frame for spinning cotton.

At the end of the line is the Glory Mine tram stop and passing loop. A public footpath crosses the line, giving access to Crich Stand.

===Woodland Walk and Sculpture Trail===

The Woodland Walk and Sculpture trail connects the tram stops at Victoria Park and Wakebridge, passing through the mixed woodland that is native to the limestone geology of the Crich area. Tree cover is mostly ash, but also includes sycamore, alder and silver birch, with a shrub layer of hazel, wych elm, wild rose, elder and hawthorn. The combination of the ash canopy and limestone results in a range of ground-cover plants including primrose, early purple orchid, cowslip, marjoram, garlic and strawberries.

Most of the sculptures along the trail were carved by the sculptor, Andrew Frost, using a chainsaw and carving a basic shape from a tree trunk before working on the detail. Such sculptures do not last forever, with wood splitting, fungi and the claws of badgers all contributing to their deterioration. The sculpture trail is therefore always evolving, as old sculptures are removed and new ones added.

Also to be spotted in the Woodland Walk is a stretch of the original narrow-gauge track as used in the old quarry, and a labyrinth made from old stones left in the quarry. There are views down into the valley of the River Derwent and up to Crich Stand.

==The museum&#x27;s tramcar fleet==

The museum has over 80 tramcars in its collection. The majority of these are electric double-decker trams built between 1900 and 1930 for use in a large selection of British towns and cities, but the collection also includes earlier horse and steam hauled trams, more modern trams, and trams built for a number of cities across the world.

Many of the cars are in operable condition, and are used on the museum&#x27;s running line, whilst others are restored in static condition and are displayed in the museum&#x27;s display hall or elsewhere on the site. A few are stored in unrestored condition, some of these being at the museum&#x27;s off-site store at Clay Cross.

Among this fleet are: 

*Southampton 45, built in 1903, was the very first tramcar to be preserved by the Tramway Museum Society, purchased for just £10 in 1949, after the closing ceremony of the Southampton Corporation.
*Sheffield 15, a horse-drawn tram dating from 1874, was the first tram to operate at the museum, in 1963 and before the electric overhead was erected. The car still operates on a few &#x27;horse tram&#x27; days a year.
*Blackpool and Fleetwood 2, a single deck tram built in 1898, was the first electric tram to carry passengers at the museum, in 1964.
*Blackpool 4 is the oldest electric tram in the collection and built in 1885 for the opening of Britain&#x27;s first electric street tramway. Stored, and then preserved, by Blackpool tramways, it has been in the care of the museum since 1973.
*London United Tramways 159, an electric tram built in 1902 to a particularly luxurious specification to serve London&#x27;s affluent western suburbs, between Hampton Court, Hammersmith and Wimbledon.
*Chesterfield 7, an electric tram built in 1904, survived a depot fire which destroyed many other trams and was also used as a house after withdrawal. The museum found the tram and restored it.
*Metropolitan Electric Tramways 331, built in 1930 as a prototype for the fleet of Feltham cars that served London&#x27;s northern suburbs until the 1950s.
*Glasgow 1282, a &quot;Coronation&quot; streamliner, built in 1940 and survived to run in the closing procession in 1962. Built to a very high specification and described as the finest short stage carriage vehicles in Europe.
*Sheffield 510, which entered service in 1950 and was withdrawn, still almost brand-new, when the city&#x27;s tram system closed in 1960. Car 510 was specially decorated for the occasion as &quot;Sheffield&#x27;s last tram&quot;, and still retains this decoration.
*Prague 180, built in 1908, was gifted to the museum during the Prague Spring and transported to Crich days before the subsequent Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. It became a symbol of the plight of the country.
*Den Haag Tramways No. 1147, built in 1957 in Belgium for a Dutch tramway to the classic US PCC design. This car presages the modern tram cars that are to be seen around the world today, including on the UK&#x27;s second generation tramways.

==The museum&#x27;s tramway==

===Running line===

The running line of the tramway is approximately long. The line starts from a stub terminus at &quot;Town End&quot; where outbound trams board passengers, having first disembarked inbound passengers at &quot;Stephenson Place&quot;. From &quot;Town End&quot;, about the first of line is double track, laid in a setted street, flanked by the buildings of the recreated period village, and including the inbound-only &quot;Stephenson Place&quot; tram stop. The street scene is closed off by the Bowes-Lyon Bridge, which the line crosses under on interlaced track. Just before the bridge, a junction gives access to the depot and yard.

On the far side of the bridge the line returns to double track and calls at the &quot;Victoria Park&quot; tram stop, which serves both the recreated Victorian-era public park of the same name, and the main entrance to the site from the car park. The double track continues for another before converging into single track that continues as far as the &quot;Wakebridge&quot; tram stop and passing loop, which is located some from &quot;Town End&quot;. Beyond the passing loop, the track returns to single track as far as the &quot;Glory Mine&quot; tram stop and terminus, where there is a further passing loop and a headshunt, together with a siding.

===Passenger services===

The tramway is generally operated whenever the museum is open. Depending on the time of year and level of demand, a two or three car service is normally provided. If a two car service is operated, trams pass on the double-track section in the street. If three trams are in service, trams pass both in the loop at Wakebridge and in the street. 

On special occasions, up to 18 tramcars can be operated, with trams operating in convoys of two or three through the single track sections. The convoys pass each other on the in the street, at Wakebridge, and at Glory Mine terminus.

The tramway has a 1969 tram from Berlin, which has been converted to allows visitors with disabilities to travel the line, with the provision of a wheelchair lift and wider doors.

===Methods of current collection===
Most of the museum&#x27;s trams are electric trams which were designed to be powered by an overhead wire system using one of, or a combination of, trolley poles, bow collectors or pantographs. The museum&#x27;s overhead wire system has been built so that trams with any of those types of current collection can be used. The current is supplied at 600 volts DC.

Other forms of current collection were used by electric trams, especially in the early days of such tramways, and the museum has non-operational displays of several of them:

*Conductors set in steel troughs under the roadway, as used on the UK&#x27;s first street running electric tramway at Blackpool, and represented in Crich by the display of Blackpool 4 in the Exhibition Hall.
*The stud contact system, as demonstrated with a dummy stud between the rails in the yard. This is the only known example of this form remaining, and is from Wolverhampton.

==Access to the museum==
The museum is open from early March to early November on every day of the week except Fridays, and also on Fridays during bank and school holidays. The museum opens at 10:00 and closes at 16:30 on weekdays or 17:30 on weekends and bank holidays.

The museum is some north of Derby, south of Sheffield, south-east of Manchester, and north-west of London. There is a large on-site car park. 

The nearest railway station is Whatstandwell, on the Derwent Valley Line from Derby to Matlock, from which there is a steep uphill walk of about to the museum. The museum is also directly served by roughly hourly bus services from Matlock and Alfreton, and less frequent services from Belper and Ripley. There is no bus service on Sundays.

==In the media==
The museum features in the opening of the 1969 film &quot;Women in Love&quot;, and as one of the locations in the 2012 film &quot;Sightseers&quot;.

The museum, under its old name of &quot;Crich Tramway Museum&quot;, also features in the lyrics of the John Shuttleworth song &quot;Dandelion and Burdock&quot;.

<text>The Valley of Decision is a biblical name given to the Valley of Jehoshaphat by the prophet Joel. It is the location of Jehovah&#x27;s inflictions on Zion&#x27;s enemies. The Bible mentions the Valley of Jehoshaphat only twice and identifies it as the final place where God will judge the nations that will gather in this valley in order to try to destroy Israel. Jehoshaphat means &quot;Yahweh judges&quot;; theologian Carl-Albert Keller adopts the term &quot;the Valley Called &#x27;YHWH judges&#x27;&quot;. The book of Joel describes this event as a gathering of all of the armies of the world into this Valley, where the Lord will pronounce judgment on all of them. The predicted and foreseen number of deaths is so extraordinarily high in this day of divine judgment that it will take seven months for the people of Israel to bury all of the dead men (Ezekiel 39:12-16). The dead ones will have their resting place under the soil of Israel and will never return home.

In Christian thinking, the assembly of the multitudes waiting in the valley of decision is associated with the second advent of Christ.

<text>Seol Chong (650 – 730 AD) was a leading scholar of the Unified Silla period from the Gyeongju Seol clan. He studied Confucian writings and the related Chinese classics. He is also known by the courtesy name Chongji and the pen name Bingwoldang.

Seol was the son of the prominent Buddhist figure Wonhyo and the Silla princess Yoseok, the daughter of King Muyeol. He was of head-rank six in Silla&#x27;s bone rank system. An account of his life is found in the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, yeoljeon (biographies), vol. 6 and his achievements are mentioned as well in the Samguk Yusa&#x27;s account of Wonhyo (vol. 5).

Seol Chong is best remembered for regularizing the idu and gugyeol scripts, which were the first systems for representing the Korean language in Chinese characters. The idu script had been in use previous to Seol Chong, but had lacked rigorous principles. Early in his career Seol is also credited with composing a short Confucian parable on kingship entitled &quot;The Warning of the Flower King&quot; (화왕계/花王戒) for King Sinmun of Silla. This parable is either repeated or paraphrased in the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, and influenced later writers of the Joseon period. A typically Confucian text, it criticizes monarchs for valuing pleasure-seeking over righteous rule.

Seol Chong is sometimes regarded as the progenitor of the Gyeongju Seol lineage. However, opinions on this differ, since the Seol family name is found as far back as the foundation of Silla.

He is also one of eighteen Korean Confucian sages who have been enshrined in the Korean National Confucian shrine.

<text>The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature is a book by Harvard University psychologist and philosopher William James. It comprises his edited Gifford Lectures on natural theology, which were delivered at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland between 1901 and 1902. The lectures concerned the psychological study of individual private religious experiences and mysticism, and used a range of examples to identify commonalities in religious experiences across traditions.

Soon after its publication, &quot;Varieties&quot; entered the Western canon of psychology and philosophy and has remained in print for over a century.

James later developed his philosophy of pragmatism. There are many overlapping ideas in &quot;Varieties&quot; and his 1907 book &quot;Pragmatism&quot;.

==Historical context==
===Psychology of religion===
In the 1890s, a &quot;new psychology&quot; emerged in European and American universities which coincided with the establishment of many new psychology laboratories and the appointment of faculty in psychology. New psychology&#x27;s novelty was encapsulated by its distinction from philosophy (philosophy of mind in particular) and theology, and its emphasis on the laboratory-based experimental method. As part of this development, the psychology of religion emerged as a new approach to studying religious experience, with the US being the major centre of research in this field.

A few years earlier Edwin Diller Starbuck had written a book entitled &quot;Psychology of Religion&quot; which James had written a preface to. James thanks Starbuck in the preface to his book for having &quot;made over to me his large collection of manuscript material&quot; before then citing Starbucks work throughout &quot;The Varieties&quot;. Starbuck recollects that James looked through &quot;several hundred&quot; of his documents.

The Varieties was first presented in 1901-2 as a set of twenty Gifford lectures at the University of Edinburgh. This was a lecture series instituted by Adam Gifford and intended to have a popular and public audience on the subject of natural theology, or scientific approaches to the study of religion. James had originally planned for the second half of his lectures to be a philosophical assessment of religion but ill health meant that he could only write one lecture on the topic, resulting in a work more descriptive than James had initially anticipated.

==Themes==
===Religious experiences===
In the &quot;Varieties&quot;, James explicitly excludes from his study both theology and religious institutions, choosing to limit his study to direct and immediate religious experiences, which he regarded as the more interesting object of study. Churches, theologies, and institutions are important as vehicles for passing on insights gained by religious experience but, in James&#x27;s view, they live second-hand off the original experience of the founder. A key distinction in James&#x27;s treatment of religion is between that of healthy-minded religion and religion of the sick soul; the former is a religion of life&#x27;s goodness, while the latter cannot overcome the sense of evil in the world. Although James presents this as a value-neutral distinction between different kinds of religious attitudes, he, in fact, regarded the sick-souled religious experience as preferable, and his anonymous source of melancholy experience in lectures VI and VII is, in fact, autobiographical. Following these autobiographical sections, James transitions into two lectures (IX and X) examining religious conversion from a psychological point-of-view, along with its importance in religious history. James considered healthy-mindedness to be America&#x27;s main contribution to religion, which he saw running from the transcendentalists Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman to Mary Baker Eddy&#x27;s Christian Science. At the extreme, the &quot;healthy-minded&quot; see sickness and evil as an illusion. James considered belief in the &quot;mind cure&quot; to be reasonable when compared to medicine as practiced at the beginning of the twentieth century.

James devotes two lectures to mysticism, and in the lectures, he outlines four markers common to mystical experiences. These are:
*Ineffability: the experience is incapable of being described, and must be directly experienced to be understood.
*Noesis: the experience is understood to be a state of knowledge through which divine truths can be learned.
*Transience: the experience is of limited duration.
*Passivity: the subject of the experience is passive, unable to control the arrival and departure of the experience.

He believed that religious experiences can have &quot;morbid origins&quot; in brain pathology and can be irrational, but nevertheless largely positive. Unlike the bad ideas that people have under the influence of, say, fevers or drunkenness, after a religious experience the ideas and insights usually still make sense to the person, and are often valued for the rest of the person&#x27;s life.

James had relatively little interest in the legitimacy or illegitimacy of religious experiences. Further, despite James&#x27; examples being almost exclusively drawn from Christianity, he did not mean to limit his ideas to any single religion. Religious experiences are something that people sometimes have, under certain conditions. In James&#x27; description, these experiences are inherently very complex, often life-altering and largely indescribable and unquantifiable through traditional means, yet measurable in the profound changes they have on the individuals that report such experiences.

===Pragmatism===
Ultimately James made a pragmatic argument for religion, writing that &quot;the uses of religion, its uses to the individual who has it, and the uses of the individual himself to the world, are the best arguments that truth is in it&quot;. As an example of this he gives the therapeutic effects of prayer.

Although James did not fully articulate his pragmatic philosophy until the publication of &quot;Pragmatism&quot; in 1907, the approach to religious belief in the &quot;Varieties&quot; is influenced by pragmatic philosophy. In his Philosophy and Conclusions lectures, James concludes that religion is overall beneficial to humankind, although acknowledges that this does not establish its truth. While James intended to approach the topic of religious experience from this pragmatist angle, Richard Rorty argues that he ultimately deviated from this methodology in the &quot;Varieties&quot;. In his lectures on saintliness, the intention is to discover whether the saintly virtues are beneficial for human life: if they are, then, according to pragmatism, that supports their claim to truth. However, James ends up concluding that the value of the saintly virtues is dependent on their origin: given that the saintly virtues are only beneficial if there is an afterlife for which they can prepare us, their value depends on whether they are divinely ordained or the result of human psychology. This is no longer a question of value but of empirical fact. Hence, Rorty argues that James ends up abandoning his own pragmatist philosophy due to his ultimate reliance of empirical evidence.

James remarked on the aesthetic motivation in an individual choosing a religion and praised religion for its aesthetic value. He said that individuals &quot;involuntarily intellectualize their religious experience&quot; and that metaphysical stipulations about the attributes of a deity &quot;enriches our bare piety to carry these exalted and mysterious verbal additions just as it enriches a church to have an organ and old brasses, marbles and frescoes and stained windows&quot;.

James considers the possibility of &quot;over-beliefs&quot;, beliefs which are not strictly justified by &quot;reason valid universally&quot; but which might understandably be held by educated people nonetheless. They are &quot;buildings-out performed by the intellect into directions of which feeling originally supplied the hint&quot;. Philosophy may contribute to shaping these over-beliefs—for example, traditional arguments for the existence of God, including the cosmological, design, and moral arguments, along with the argument from popular consensus. Although James did not himself endorse any of these arguments: &quot;The fact is that these arguments do but follow the combined suggestions of the facts and of our feeling. They prove nothing rigorously. They only corroborate our pre-existent partialities&quot;. He says that individuals in the past had sought such universal proofs, asking &quot;what more ideal refuge could there be than such a system would offer to spirits vexed by the muddiness and accidentality of the world of sensible things?&quot;. James says he has his own over-belief, which he does not intend to prove, that there is a greater reality not normally accessible by our normal ways of relating to the world, but which religious experiences can connect us to.

==Reception and legacy==

The August 1902 &quot;New York Times&quot; review of the first edition ends with the following:

A July 1963 &quot;Time&quot; magazine review of an expanded edition published that year ends with quotes about the book from Peirce and Santayana:

In 1913 Josiah Royce wrote a paper on George Fox which he described as &quot;a fragmentary contribution to that study of the &quot;Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; which William James has so significantly brought to the attention of students of human nature&quot;. Royce described James&#x27; book as one which &quot;with all its wealth of illustration, and in its courageous enterprise, has a certain classic beauty&quot;. He further considered the book to be reflective of &quot;the manifoldness and of the breadth of the general psychological movement itself&quot;.

In 1986, Nicholas Lash criticised James&#x27;s &quot;Varieties&quot;, challenging James&#x27;s separation of the personal and institutional. Lash argues that religious geniuses such as St. Paul or Jesus, with whom James was particularly interested, did not have their religious experiences in isolation but within and influenced by a social and historical context. Ultimately, Lash argues that this comes from James&#x27;s failure to overcome Cartesian dualism in his thought: while James believed he had succeeded in surpassing Descartes, he was still tied to a notion of an internal ego, distinct from the body or outside world, which undergoes experiences.

The book was cherished by Ludwig Wittgenstein who wrote to Bertrand Russell that &quot;Whenever I have time now I read James’ Varieties of Religious Exp[erience]. This book does me a lot of good&quot;. It was one of the few books he recommended to his friend Maurice O&#x27;Connor Drury. The influence of James&#x27; book is seen from letters sent to him from his sister Hermione as he was serving at the front during World War 1. She was concerned about his well-being and wrote to him that &quot;there will be time for you to be a Jamesian type after the war is over!&quot;. Brian McGuinness writes that Wittgenstein aspired to be the &#x27;saintly&#x27; type described in the book.

In more recent years the book has continued to be positively reviewed. In 1951 William A. Christian called the book &quot;still one of the best books on the psychological variables in the domain of religion&quot; and in 1995 Stephen H. Webb remarked that &quot;James is perhaps most read today for his sensitive descriptions of the bewildering diversity of religious forms&quot;.

The book has been described as philosophical, as opposed to merely psychological. Michael Hodges writes that James&#x27;s book is &quot;addressed to a philosophical audience&quot; and in 1979 Gary T. Alexander wrote that the book is &quot;seldom used in any substantive manner by current psychologists of religion, who, although often lauding the work as a creation of genius, tend to view it as primarily philosophical in nature&quot;.

<doc id="1230413" wikidata="Q61533" url="?curid=1230413" title="Fritz Fischer (medical doctor)">
<text>Fritz Ernst Fischer (5 October 1912 – 2003) was a Nazi German medical doctor who performed medical atrocities on inmates of the Ravensbrück concentration camp. He was tried and convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1947 Doctors&#x27; Trial; he was sentenced to life imprisonment, but his sentence was commuted to 15 years and he was released in 1954.

== Early life and war crimes ==
Fischer was born in Berlin. He studied medicine first at Bonn, later at Berlin and Leipzig, and finally graduated in Hamburg in 1938. He joined the SS in 1934 (ultimately reaching the rank of &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; [major]) and became a member of the NSDAP in June 1937. On 1 November 1939, he was assigned to the Waffen-SS of the SS-Department of the Hohenlychen Sanatorium as a physician and SS Second Lieutenant.

In 1940, he became troop physician of the SS Division &quot;Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler&quot;. After having been wounded he was posted back to Hohenlychen and worked in the camp hospital of the Ravensbrück concentration camp as a surgical assistant to Karl Gebhardt. He participated in the surgical experiments carried out on concentration camp inmates there.

== Trial and later life ==
After World War II, he was tried in the Doctors&#x27; Trial in Nuremberg, convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and was condemned to life imprisonment. His sentence was reduced to 15 years in 1951 and he was released in March 1954.

Fischer subsequently regained his license to practice medicine and started a new career at the chemical company Boehringer in Ingelheim, where he stayed until his retirement.

Based on available records, when he died in 2003, aged 90 or 91, he was the last known living of those indicted at the Doctors&#x27; Trial.

<text>Data remanence is the residual representation of digital data that remains even after attempts have been made to remove or erase the data. This residue may result from data being left intact by a nominal file deletion operation, by reformatting of storage media that does not remove data previously written to the media, or through physical properties of the storage media that allow previously written data to be recovered. Data remanence may make inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information possible should the storage media be released into an uncontrolled environment (&quot;e.g.&quot;, thrown in the bin (trash) or lost). 

Various techniques have been developed to counter data remanence. These techniques are classified as clearing, purging/sanitizing, or destruction. Specific methods include overwriting, degaussing, encryption, and media destruction.

Effective application of countermeasures can be complicated by several factors, including media that are inaccessible, media that cannot effectively be erased, advanced storage systems that maintain histories of data throughout the data&#x27;s life cycle, and persistence of data in memory that is typically considered volatile.

Several standards exist for the secure removal of data and the elimination of data remanence.

==Causes==

Many operating systems, file managers, and other software provide a facility where a file is not immediately deleted when the user requests that action. Instead, the file is moved to a holding area (i.e. the &quot;trash&quot;), making it easy for the user to undo a mistake. Similarly, many software products automatically create backup copies of files that are being edited, to allow the user to restore the original version, or to recover from a possible crash (&quot;autosave&quot; feature).

Even when an explicit deleted file retention facility is not provided or when the user does not use it, operating systems do not actually remove the contents of a file when it is deleted unless they are aware that explicit erasure commands are required, like on a solid-state drive. (In such cases, the operating system will issue the Serial ATA TRIM command or the SCSI UNMAP command to let the drive know to no longer maintain the deleted data.) Instead, they simply remove the file&#x27;s entry from the file system directory because this requires less work and is therefore faster, and the contents of the file—the actual data—remain on the storage medium. The data will remain there until the operating system reuses the space for new data. In some systems, enough filesystem metadata are also left behind to enable easy undeletion by commonly available utility software. Even when undelete has become impossible, the data, until it has been overwritten, can be read by software that reads disk sectors directly. Computer forensics often employs such software.

Likewise, reformatting, repartitioning, or reimaging a system is unlikely to write to every area of the disk, though all will cause the disk to appear empty or, in the case of reimaging, empty except for the files present in the image, to most software.

Finally, even when the storage media is overwritten, physical properties of the media may permit recovery of the previous contents. In most cases however, this recovery is not possible by just reading from the storage device in the usual way, but requires using laboratory techniques such as disassembling the device and directly accessing/reading from its components.

 below gives further explanations for causes of data remanence.

==Countermeasures==
There are three levels commonly recognized for eliminating remnant data:

===Clearing===

Clearing is the removal of sensitive data from storage devices in such a way that there is assurance that the data may not be reconstructed using normal system functions or software file/data recovery utilities. The data may still be recoverable, but not without special laboratory techniques.

Clearing is typically an administrative protection against accidental disclosure within an organization. For example, before a hard drive is re-used within an organization, its contents may be cleared to prevent their accidental disclosure to the next user.

===Purging===

Purging or sanitizing is the physical rewrite of sensitive data from a system or storage device done with the specific intent of rendering the data unrecoverable at a later time. Purging, proportional to the sensitivity of the data, is generally done before releasing media beyond control, such as before discarding old media, or moving media to a computer with different security requirements.

===Destruction===
The storage media is made unusable for conventional equipment. Effectiveness of destroying the media varies by medium and method. Depending on recording density of the media, and/or the destruction technique, this may leave data recoverable by laboratory methods. Conversely, destruction using appropriate techniques is the most secure method of preventing retrieval.

==Specific methods==

===Overwriting===

A common method used to counter data remanence is to overwrite the storage media with new data. This is often called wiping or shredding a disk or file, by analogy to common methods of destroying print media, although the mechanism bears no similarity to these. Because such a method can often be implemented in software alone, and may be able to selectively target only part of the media, it is a popular, low-cost option for some applications. Overwriting is generally an acceptable method of clearing, as long as the media is writable and not damaged.

The simplest overwrite technique writes the same data everywhere—often just a pattern of all zeros. At a minimum, this will prevent the data from being retrieved simply by reading from the media again using standard system functions.

In an attempt to counter more advanced data recovery techniques, specific overwrite patterns and multiple passes have often been prescribed. These may be generic patterns intended to eradicate any trace signatures; an example is the seven-pass pattern , , , , , , , sometimes erroneously attributed to US standard DOD 5220.22-M.

One challenge with overwriting is that some areas of the disk may be inaccessible, due to media degradation or other errors. Software overwrite may also be problematic in high-security environments, which require stronger controls on data commingling than can be provided by the software in use. The use of advanced storage technologies may also make file-based overwrite ineffective (see the related discussion below under ).

There are specialized machines and software that are capable of doing overwriting. The software can sometimes be a standalone operating system specifically designed for data destruction. There are also machines specifically designed to wipe hard drives to the department of defense specifications DOD 5220.22-M.

====Feasibility of recovering overwritten data====

Peter Gutmann investigated data recovery from nominally overwritten media in the mid-1990s. He suggested magnetic force microscopy may be able to recover such data, and developed specific patterns, for specific drive technologies, designed to counter such. These patterns have come to be known as the Gutmann method. Gutmann&#x27;s belief in the possibility of data recovery is based on many questionable assumptions and factual errors that indicate a low level of understanding of how hard drives work. 

Daniel Feenberg, an economist at the private National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that the chances of overwritten data being recovered from a modern hard drive amount to &quot;urban legend&quot;. He also points to the &quot;-minute gap&quot; Rose Mary Woods created on a tape of Richard Nixon discussing the Watergate break-in. Erased information in the gap has not been recovered, and Feenberg claims doing so would be an easy task compared to recovery of a modern high density digital signal.

As of November 2007, the United States Department of Defense considers overwriting acceptable for clearing magnetic media within the same security area/zone, but not as a sanitization method. Only degaussing or physical destruction is acceptable for the latter.

On the other hand, according to the 2014 NIST Special Publication 800-88 Rev. 1 (p. 7): &quot;For storage devices containing &quot;magnetic&quot; media, a single overwrite pass with a fixed pattern such as binary zeros typically hinders recovery of data even if state of the art laboratory techniques are applied to attempt to retrieve the data.&quot; An analysis by Wright et al. of recovery techniques, including magnetic force microscopy, also concludes that a single wipe is all that is required for modern drives. They point out that the long time required for multiple wipes &quot;has created a situation where many organizations ignore the issue [altogether] – resulting in data leaks and loss.&quot;

===Degaussing===

Degaussing is the removal or reduction of a magnetic field of a disk or drive, using a device called a degausser that has been designed for the media being erased. Applied to magnetic media, degaussing may purge an entire media element quickly and effectively.

Degaussing often renders hard disks inoperable, as it erases low-level formatting that is only done at the factory during manufacturing. In some cases, it is possible to return the drive to a functional state by having it serviced at the manufacturer. However, some modern degaussers use such a strong magnetic pulse that the motor that spins the platters may be destroyed in the degaussing process, and servicing may not be cost-effective. Degaussed computer tape such as DLT can generally be reformatted and reused with standard consumer hardware.

In some high-security environments, one may be required to use a degausser that has been approved for the task. For example, in US government and military jurisdictions, one may be required to use a degausser from the NSA&#x27;s &quot;Evaluated Products List&quot;.

===Encryption===

Encrypting data before it is stored on the media may mitigate concerns about data remanence. If the decryption key is strong and carefully controlled, it may effectively make any data on the media unrecoverable. Even if the key is stored on the media, it may prove easier or quicker to overwrite just the key, versus the entire disk. This process is called crypto-shredding.

Encryption may be done on a file-by-file basis, or on the whole disk. Cold boot attacks are one of the few possible methods for subverting a full-disk encryption method, as there is no possibility of storing the plain text key in an unencrypted section of the medium. See the section Complications: Data in RAM for further discussion.

Other side-channel attacks (such as keyloggers, acquisition of a written note containing the decryption key, or rubber-hose cryptanalysis) may offer a greater chance of success, but do not rely on weaknesses in the cryptographic method employed. As such, their relevance for this article is minor.

===Media destruction===
Thorough destruction of the underlying storage media is the most certain way to counter data remanence. However, the process is generally time-consuming, cumbersome, and may require extremely thorough methods, as even a small fragment of the media may contain large amounts of data.

Specific destruction techniques include:

* Physically breaking the media apart (e.g., by grinding or shredding)
* Chemically altering the media into a non-readable, non-reverse-constructible state (e.g., through incineration or exposure to caustic/corrosive chemicals) 
* Phase transition (e.g., liquefaction or vaporization of a solid disk)
* For magnetic media, raising its temperature above the Curie point
* For many electric/electronic volatile and non-volatile storage media, exposure to electromagnetic fields greatly exceeding safe operational specifications (e.g., high-voltage electric current or high-amplitude microwave or ionizing radiation)

==Complications==

===Inaccessible media areas===

Storage media may have areas which become inaccessible by normal means. For example, magnetic disks may develop new bad sectors after data has been written, and tapes require inter-record gaps. Modern hard disks often feature reallocation of marginal sectors or tracks, automated in a way that the operating system would not need to work with it. The problem is especially significant in solid-state drives (SSDs) that rely on relatively large relocated bad block tables. Attempts to counter data remanence by overwriting may not be successful in such situations, as data remnants may persist in such nominally inaccessible areas.

=== Advanced storage systems ===
Data storage systems with more sophisticated features may make overwrite ineffective, especially on a per-file basis. For example, journaling file systems increase the integrity of data by recording write operations in multiple locations, and applying transaction-like semantics; on such systems, data remnants may exist in locations &quot;outside&quot; the nominal file storage location. Some file systems also implement copy-on-write or built-in revision control, with the intent that writing to a file never overwrites data in-place. Furthermore, technologies such as RAID and anti-fragmentation techniques may result in file data being written to multiple locations, either by design (for fault tolerance), or as data remnants.

Wear leveling can also defeat data erasure, by relocating blocks between the time when they are originally written and the time when they are overwritten. For this reason, some security protocols tailored to operating systems or other software featuring automatic wear leveling recommend conducting a free-space wipe of a given drive and then copying many small, easily identifiable &quot;junk&quot; files or files containing other nonsensitive data to fill as much of that drive as possible, leaving only the amount of free space necessary for satisfactory operation of system hardware and software. As storage and system demands grow, the &quot;junk data&quot; files can be deleted as necessary to free up space; even if the deletion of &quot;junk data&quot; files is not secure, their initial nonsensitivity reduces to near zero the consequences of recovery of data remanent from them.

===Optical media===

As optical media are not magnetic, they are not erased by conventional degaussing. Write-once optical media (CD-R, DVD-R, etc.) also cannot be purged by overwriting. Rewritable optical media, such as CD-RW and DVD-RW, may be receptive to overwriting. Methods for successfully sanitizing optical discs include delaminating or abrading the metallic data layer, shredding, incinerating, destructive electrical arcing (as by exposure to microwave energy), and submersion in a polycarbonate solvent (e.g., acetone).

===Data on solid-state drives===

Research from the Center for Magnetic Recording and Research, University of California, San Diego has uncovered problems inherent in erasing data stored on solid-state drives (SSDs). Researchers discovered three problems with file storage on SSDs:

Solid-state drives, which are flash-based, differ from hard-disk drives in two ways: first, in the way data is stored; and second, in the way the algorithms are used to manage and access that data. These differences can be exploited to recover previously erased data. SSDs maintain a layer of indirection between the logical addresses used by computer systems to access data and the internal addresses that identify physical storage. This layer of indirection hides idiosyncratic media interfaces and enhances SSD performance, reliability, and lifespan (see wear leveling), but it can also produce copies of the data that are invisible to the user and that a sophisticated attacker could recover. For sanitizing entire disks, sanitize commands built into the SSD hardware have been found to be effective when implemented correctly, and software-only techniques for sanitizing entire disks have been found to work most, but not all, of the time. In testing, none of the software techniques were effective for sanitizing individual files. These included well-known algorithms such as the Gutmann method, US DoD 5220.22-M, RCMP TSSIT OPS-II, Schneier 7 Pass, and Secure Empty Trash on macOS (a feature included in versions OS X 10.3-10.9).

The TRIM feature in many SSD devices, if properly implemented, will eventually erase data after it is deleted, but the process can take some time, typically several minutes. Many older operating systems do not support this feature, and not all combinations of drives and operating systems work.

=== Data in RAM ===
Data remanence has been observed in static random-access memory (SRAM), which is typically considered volatile (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the contents degrade with loss of external power). In one study, data retention was observed even at room temperature.

Data remanence has also been observed in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Modern DRAM chips have a built-in self-refresh module, as they not only require a power supply to retain data, but must also be periodically refreshed to prevent their data contents from fading away from the capacitors in their integrated circuits. A study found data remanence in DRAM with data retention of seconds to minutes at room temperature and &quot;a full week without refresh when cooled with liquid nitrogen.&quot; The study authors were able to use a cold boot attack to recover cryptographic keys for several popular full disk encryption systems, including Microsoft BitLocker, Apple FileVault, dm-crypt for Linux, and TrueCrypt.

Despite some memory degradation, authors of the above described study were able to take advantage of redundancy in the way keys are stored after they have been expanded for efficient use, such as in key scheduling. The authors recommend that computers be powered down, rather than be left in a &quot;sleep&quot; state, when not in physical control of the owner. In some cases, such as certain modes of the software program BitLocker, the authors recommend that a boot password or a key on a removable USB device be used. TRESOR is a kernel patch for Linux specifically intended to prevent cold boot attacks on RAM by ensuring that encryption keys are not accessible from user space and are stored in the CPU rather than system RAM whenever possible. Newer versions of the disk encryption software VeraCrypt can encrypt in-RAM keys and passwords on 64-bit Windows.

<text>Fern Kinney (born Fern Kinney-Lewis, July 11, 1949) is an American R&amp;B and disco singer, who is best remembered for her releases, &quot;Groove Me&quot; and &quot;Together We Are Beautiful&quot;.

==Career==
Born in Jackson, Mississippi, United States, Kinney originally sang in The Poppies with Dorothy Moore.

In the early 1970s, she began working as a session musician and backing vocalist. Among the songs she sang on were King Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Groove Me&quot;, and her former &quot;Poppie&quot; bandmate Dorothy Moore&#x27;s 1976 Top 10 single, &quot;Misty Blue&quot;.

By 1979, then having settled as a housewife, Kinney decided to attempt a comeback, and she recorded her own version of &quot;Groove Me&quot;, but changed the rhythm on the song to turn it into a disco dance track. The song reached number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart. Her next single &quot;Together We Are Beautiful&quot;, released in 1980 was another disco song, but with a slower and more sultry beat. It had been recorded by the British vocalist, Steve Allan, eighteen months earlier. Kinney&#x27;s effort failed to chart in the United States, but reached number one in the UK Singles Chart.

Kinney&#x27;s subsequent releases attempted to continue in the disco style, however by this time the disco fad had passed its peak and Kinney was unable to repeat her success. By 1983, she had returned to her earlier career as a backing vocalist. In 1994, Music Club released an album (MCCD 167) of Kinney&#x27;s records called &quot;Chemistry The Best Of&quot; under licence from Malaco Records, which contained 17 tracks.

<text>Fungus Rock, sometimes known as &quot;Mushroom Rock&quot;, and among the Maltese as Il-Ġebla tal-Ġeneral (), is a small islet in the form of a massive lump of limestone at the entrance to an almost circular black lagoon in Dwejra, on the coast of Gozo, itself an island in the Maltese archipelago. It is located at and falls within the jurisdiction of the town of San Lawrenz.

The Dwejra nature reserve is administratively part of the town. The Fungus Rock is a prominent landmark of the reserve, as was formerly the Azure Window, before its collapse on March 8, 2017.

== History ==
The Knights Hospitaller apparently discovered what is popularly known as the Maltese fungus growing on the rock&#x27;s flat top. This plant, which is a kind of parasitic flowering plant, not a fungus, has a repulsive smell. Doctors at the time believed that it had medicinal properties. The Knights used it as a styptic dressing for wounds and a cure for dysentery. They so prized it that they often gave gifts of it to distinguished noblemen and visitors to the Maltese islands.

Grand Master Pinto decreed the Rock out of bounds in 1746; trespassers risked a three-year spell as oarsmen in the Knights&#x27; galleys. He posted a permanent guard there and even built a precarious cable-car basket from the rock to the mainland, away. He also ordered the sides smoothed to remove handholds.

Pinto&#x27;s efforts were perhaps unnecessary. Pharmacologists are studying the medical effects of &quot;Fucus coccineus melitensis&quot; today. 

Presently, Fungus Rock is a nature reserve. However, the shoreline nearby is accessible to bathers and the sea provides perfect snorkeling. Divers may experience big rocks, tiny caverns and swim-throughs along with varied species that swim around the vicinity of the rock.

The sunset can be photographed through the opening in Fungus Rock, but only from the inlet anchorage, and only during seasons when the sun descends the right way.

<doc id="1230430" wikidata="Q42002" url="?curid=1230430" title="Jewish studies">
<text>Jewish studies (or Judaic studies; ) is an academic discipline centered on the study of Jews and Judaism. Jewish studies is interdisciplinary and combines aspects of history (especially Jewish history), Middle Eastern studies, Asian studies, Oriental studies, religious studies, archeology, sociology, languages (Jewish languages), political science, area studies, women&#x27;s studies, and ethnic studies. Jewish studies as a distinct field is mainly present at colleges and universities in North America.

Related fields include Holocaust research and Israel studies, and in Israel, Jewish thought.
Bar-Ilan University has the world&#x27;s largest school of Jewish studies; while 
Harvard was the first American university, and perhaps the first in the world, to appoint a full-time scholar of Judaica to its faculty.

==History==
The Jewish tradition generally places a high value on learning and study, especially of religious texts. Torah study (study of the Torah and more broadly of the entire Hebrew Bible as well as Rabbinic literature such as the Talmud and Midrash) is considered a religious obligation.

Since the Renaissance and the growth of higher education, many people, including people not of the Jewish faith, have chosen to study Jews and Judaism as a means of understanding the Jewish religion, heritage, and Jewish history.

The term &quot;Wissenschaft des Judentums&quot; (Science of Judaism) first made its appearance among young Jewish intellectuals in Berlin during the 1810s and 1820s. The first organized attempt at developing and disseminating &quot;Wissenschaft des Judentums&quot; was the &quot;Verein für Kultur und Wissenschaft der Juden&quot; (Society for Jewish Culture and Science of the Jews), founded around 1819 by Eduard Gans, (a pupil of Hegel), and his associates, among them Leopold Zunz, Moses Moser, and later Heinrich Heine. Its principal objective, as it was then defined in the &quot;Zeitschrift für die Wissenschaft des Judentums&quot; (1822), was the study of Judaism by subjecting it to criticism and modern methods of research.
With the development of the &quot;Science of Judaism&quot; throughout the 19th and 20th centuries and its ramification into many spheres and subjects (Bible criticism, Talmud, Jewish literature of all periods, history and archaeology, religious philosophy, and the like), &quot;Science of Judaism&quot; came to signify the totality of studies concerning the Jewish people and Judaism. In English speaking countries these studies came to be referred to by such terms as &quot;Judaistica&quot;, &quot;Judaica&quot;, and &quot;Jewish studies&quot; or &quot;Judaic studies&quot;.

Religious instruction specifically for Jews, especially for those who wish to join the rabbinate, is taught at Jewish seminaries, and in Orthodox Judaism, yeshivas. Among the most prominent outside of Orthodox Judaism are the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary and the Reform Hebrew Union College. See List of rabbinical schools. 
For the majority of Jewish students attending regular academic colleges and universities there is a growing choice of Jewish studies courses and even degrees available at many institutions.

The subject of antisemitism and the Holocaust, as well as the establishment of the modern State of Israel and the revival of the Hebrew language have all stimulated unusual interest in greater in-depth academic study, research, reading and lecturing about these core areas of knowledge related to current events. In the United States, the unique position that Jewish Americans have held within the nation&#x27;s complex social structure has created substantial scholarship, especially with regards to topics such as interfaith marriage, political activism, and influence on popular culture.

In a 1966 article published in the &quot;American Jewish Year Book&quot;, the Hebrew literature scholar Arnold J. Band was among the first to call attention to the &quot;spread of Jewish studies as an accepted academic discipline in the American liberal arts colleges and universities since the Second World War&quot;. In his article Band offered a definition of Jewish (Judaic) studies as &quot;the discipline which deals with the historical experiences, in the intellectual, religious, and social spheres, of the Jewish people in all centuries and countries&quot;.

The political situation in the Middle East, especially the Arab–Israeli conflict and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, has raised the profile of Jews, Judaism, and Zionism on campuses, spurring many on to study this subject for non-degree as well as for credits in obtaining a Bachelor of Arts or Master of Arts degree. A growing number of mature students are even obtaining Ph.D.s in Jewish studies judging by the quantity of courses and programs available. Many hope to obtain employment in the field of Jewish education or in Jewish communal service agencies.

Some Christians search for an understanding of the Jewish background for Jesus Christ and Christianity and for the source of monotheism that sprang from Judaism. There are those who are seeking an understanding of the complex and volatile relationship between Islam and Judaism. Others are searching for spirituality and philosophy and therefore seek classes in Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) and Jewish philosophy. There are also those who have a genuine concern and attachment to modern Israel as Christian Zionists and therefore seek to learn more about the subjects related to their beliefs.

Jewish studies have been offered at universities around the world. The following are only a few significant examples of places where Jewish studies are offered and flourish in an academic setting:

==Colleges that offer Jewish studies==
Several colleges in the United States and Israel offer Jewish studies or Judaic studies as a major.

===Israel===

====Hebrew University of Jerusalem====
The Institute of Jewish Studies of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem was established in 1924, a few months before the official opening of the university. Widely considered to be the world&#x27;s premier center of Jewish studies, the institute includes eight teaching departments and 18 research institutes, oversees the publication of a wide variety of journals and periodicals and has a student body of over 1200 students pursuing undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees in Jewish studies. In addition, the university has several institutes dedicated to specific subjects of Jewish studies, such as the Institute of Contemporary Jewry, the Institute for Research in Jewish Law, the Institute of Archaeology, the Center for Jewish Art, the Jewish Music Research Center, the Center for Jewish Education, and the Department of Jewish Thought. The Jewish National and University Library, which serves as the library of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of Hebraica and Judaica. The university also benefits from Jerusalem&#x27;s unparalleled concentration of resources, which include: some 50 museums, most of which are dedicated to, or contain significant exhibits pertinent to, Jewish studies; dozens of independent research institutes and libraries dedicated to Jewish studies; over 100 rabbinical colleges representing all streams of Judaism; and the city of Jerusalem itself, the ancient and modern center of Jewish life, thought and study.

====Bar-Ilan University====

Bar-Ilan University in Ramat-Gan, Israel, has the world&#x27;s largest school of Jewish studies, which includes 14 teaching departments, 21 research institutes, some 300 faculty members and over 2,000 students. The school publishes 11 journals and the only internet journal in Jewish Studies — &quot;Jewish Studies&quot;. Flagship projects of the Faculty of Jewish Studies include: the Responsa Project which is the largest database of classical Jewish sources throughout the ages; The &quot;Mikraot Gdolot Haketer&quot; which is the most accurate edition of the Mikraot Gdolot; The Ingeborg Rennert Center of Jerusalem Studies; and the Tell es-Safi/Gath Archaeological Project, the excavations of the site of biblical Gath of the Philistines under the auspices of Prof. Aren Maier.

====Tel Aviv University====

<doc id="1230433" wikidata="Q5602449" url="?curid=1230433" title="Green Cove Springs and Melrose Railroad">
<text>The Green Cove Springs and Melrose Railroad was a narrow gauge common carrier and logging railroad that operated between 1881 and 1899. Its core route ran for 33.5 miles in a southwesterly direction from the city of Green Cove Springs, Florida, United States, to the lakeside town of Melrose.

== History ==
The company was incorporated under Florida state law and approved on February 28, 1881, with construction commencing a short time later. In March 1883, the first section of the route from Green Cove Springs to the community of Sharon was opened. Further construction proceeded gradually, with the railroad finally reaching Melrose in 1890.

During the mid-1880s, the railroad was faced with financial troubles and the company underwent reorganization twice, becoming the Green Cove Springs &amp; Midland Railway in 1885 and then Western Railway of Florida a year later. In 1892, the railroad was sold and the company reorganized for a third and final time to South-Western Railroad.

=== Land grants ===
Once construction commenced, the railroad was promised land grants from the state of Florida.
* Florida state law chapter 3495, approved March 2, 1883, enlarged the area from which they could choose land grants. At the time, their route had been adopted, and most of the land along the route had already been sold off.
* Florida state law chapter 3644, approved February 11, 1885, further enlarged the area for land grants, and extended the deadline to January 1, 1886.
* Florida state law chapter 3796, approved June 7, 1887, extended the deadline for land grants to July 1, 1888.

=== Closure ===
The beginning of the end came during the late 1890s following a Great Freeze which devastated the local economy and resulted in a loss of passenger and freight traffic. The railroad held on for a few more years to continue serving the logging industry before finally shutting down in 1899.

Portions of the rail bed can still be seen in some places including &quot;Tram Road&quot;, an unpaved footpath at Gold Head Branch State Park which follows the old right of way for about a mile or so. In addition, part of the railroad&#x27;s route through Green Cove Springs is today Melrose Avenue.

<text>Drew Shindell is a physicist and a climate specialist and professor at Duke University&#x27;s Nicholas School of the Environment. He is listed as an ISI Highly Cited Researcher. He was a chapter lead (coordinating lead author) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) October 8, 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C as well as on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#x27;s Fifth Assessment Report in 2013. He has testified on climate issues before both houses of the US Congress, at the request of both parties. His research concerns natural and human drivers of climate change, linkages between air quality and climate change, and the interface between climate change science and policy. He has been an author on more than 200 peer-reviewed publications and received awards from Scientific American, NASA, the EPA, and the NSF.

He was also a leading scientific contributor to the establishment of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, a group of now more than 60 nations along with many intergovernmental and non-governmental organization dedicated to implementing actions that simultaneously reduce air pollution and mitigate climate change. He chaired the 2011 Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone produced by the United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organization that, along with the paper in &quot;Science&quot; he led in 2012 entitled &quot;Simultaneously Mitigating Near-Term Climate Change and Improving Human Health and Food Security&quot; helped to catalyze the Coalition&#x27;s formation. He has served as Chair of the Science Advisory Panel to the Coalition since 2012.

He has addressed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the World Bank, federal and state officials, developed a climate change course with the American Museum of Natural History, and made numerous appearances in newspapers, on radio, and on TV as part of his public outreach efforts. In 2023, Dr. Shindell was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. 

== Education and Employment ==
Shindell is a physicist who got his B.A. at University of California at Berkeley in 1988 and his Ph.D at the State University of New York in Stony Brook in 1995. From 2000 to 2014 he was a climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. While there, Dr. Shindell taught atmospheric chemistry at nearby Columbia University for more than a decade. In 2014 he was named Professor of Climate Sciences at Duke University, where he was appointed the Nicholas Professor of Earth Sciences in 2016.

== Research interests ==

His research is concerned with global climate change, climate variability, atmospheric chemistry and air pollution. He uses climate models to investigate chemical changes such as air pollution, climate changes such as global warming, and the connections between these two. Among his research interests are:

* Long-term changes in climate and climate variability patterns
* Sensitivity of climate change to different drivers
* Climate and air quality linkages and public policy
* Interdisciplinary assessment of the impact of policy options on climate, public health, food and the economy
* Atmospheric composition changes and solar power generation

<text>Dorothy Moore (born October 13, 1946) is an American blues, gospel, and R&amp;B singer best known for her 1976 hit song, &quot;Misty Blue&quot;.

==Career==
Moore&#x27;s parents were Mary Moore and Melvin Hendrex Senior. Her father performed under the stage name Melvin Henderson as a member of the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi. She was raised by her great grandmother and began singing in the church choir at a young age. She was a member of the Poppies with Petsye McCune and Rosemary Taylor when she was attending Jackson State University. The group recorded for Epic Records&#x27; Date subsidiary, reaching number 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1966 with &quot;Lullaby of Love&quot;. Solo singles for the Avco, GSF and Chimneyville labels followed.

Her career took off with several ballads for Malaco Records. &quot;Misty Blue&quot; (1976) reached number 2 on the R&amp;B chart and number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot; (also 1976) reached number 7 on the R&amp;B chart and number 58 on the pop chart. &quot;I Believe You&quot; was number 5 on the R&amp;B and number 27 on the pop chart in 1977. The album of the same name was rated four and a half out of five stars retrospectively by Bil Carpenter of AllMusic.

She next recorded two albums for Volt Records. She returned to the Malaco label in 1990, for whom she recorded several albums during the ensuing decade and into the new millennium.

Moore has four Grammy Award nominations. Her version of &quot;Misty Blue&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for the 1996 movie &quot;Phenomenon&quot;, and on the 2005 compilation album, &quot;Classic Soul Ballads&quot;.

<text>The Fernandina and Amelia Beach Railway Company, owned by W. Naylor Thompson, Samuel A. Swann, D. E. Maxwell, William B. C. Duryee and Augustus O. MacDonell, officers of the Florida Transit Railroad, was incorporated by Florida state law chapter 3497, approved March 1, 1883, for the purpose of constructing a line of railway from the City of Fernandina Beach to Amelia City on Amelia Beach. The two-mile line was built in 1886 and operated by the Florida Railway &amp; Navigation Company (successor to the Florida Transit Railroad). In 1900 the line was sold and converted to an electric streetcar line.

<doc id="1230465" wikidata="Q6378183" url="?curid=1230465" title="List of Pittsburgh Penguins head coaches">
<text>The Pittsburgh Penguins are an American professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They play in the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). The franchise was established as one of six new franchises of the 1967 NHL expansion. Since their foundation, the Penguins had played their home games at the Civic Arena, which was replaced by the Consol Energy Center in 2010. The franchise is co-owned by Ronald Burkle and Mario Lemieux—the only player/owner in the NHL&#x27;s modern era. According to Forbes, the Penguins were the 11th most valuable NHL franchise, at US$222 million, in 2009.

There have been 22 head coaches for the Penguins franchise. The franchise&#x27;s first head coach was Red Sullivan, former New York Rangers captain and coach. Sullivan was replaced by future Hockey Hall of Fame inductee Red Kelly, after two seasons. Kelly was inducted into the Hall of Fame as a player, and head coaches Craig Patrick, Bob Johnson, Scotty Bowman, and Herb Brooks were inducted as builders. Eddie Johnston—who along with Patrick and Ken Schinkel served two tenures as head coach—leads Penguins&#x27; coaches in games coached. Bob Johnson led the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup victory in 1991, but was forced to retire due to health problems after the season—he died later that year. Bowman succeeded Johnson and coached the team to its second Stanley Cup victory the following season. Michel Therrien won the Prince of Wales Trophy, as Eastern Conference champion, during the 2007–08 season. Therrien was replaced the following season by Dan Bylsma. Bylsma would lead the Penguins to their third Stanley Cup championship that same season. Bylsma was fired after the 2013–14 season and replaced by Mike Johnston. Johnston was fired during the 2015–16 season and replaced by Michael (Mike) Barry Sullivan. Sullivan led the Penguins to their fourth Stanley Cup victory that season and also their fifth Stanley cup victory in the following season in 2016–17

==Notes and references==
* Beginning with the 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted a shootout for regular season games that remained tied after a five-minute overtime period, which prevented ties.
* Head coaches with multiple terms are counted once; figures are career totals. For a specific order of the coaches see the Footnotes section.
* Each year is linked to an article about that particular NHL season. 
* Gene Ubriaco served as the Penguins&#x27; head coach to begin the 1989–90 season; the team began with a 10–14–2 record. On December 5, 1989, Craig Patrick replaced Ubriaco as an interim head coach. Under Patrick, the team went 22–26–6 and did not qualify for the playoffs.
* After starting the 1996–97 season with a record of 31–26–5, the Penguins went 1–8 in nine consecutive games in February and March 1997. Coach Eddie Johnston was replaced by Craig Patrick, under whom the team finished the season 7–10–3 and lost in the first round of the playoffs four games to one.
* Michel Therrien coached the Penguins to a 27–25–5 record to start the 2008–09 season, at which point he was replaced by Dan Bylsma.
* Mike Johnston coached the Penguins to a 15–10–3 record to start the 2015–16 season, at which point he was replaced by Mike Sullivan.

Hawken has authored articles, op-eds, and peer-reviewed papers, and seven books, including: &quot;The Next Economy&quot; (Ballantine 1983), &quot;Growing a Business&quot; (Simon and Schuster 1987), &quot;The Ecology of Commerce&quot; (HarperCollins 1993), and &quot;Blessed Unrest&quot; (Viking 2007).

&quot;The Ecology of Commerce&quot; was voted the #1 college text on business and the environment by professors in 67 business schools. The businessman and environmentalist Ray Anderson of Interface, Inc. credited &quot;The Ecology of Commerce&quot; with his environmental awakening. He described reading it as a &quot;spear in the chest experience&quot;, after which Anderson started crisscrossing the country with a near-evangelical fervor, telling fellow executives about the need to reduce waste and carbon emissions.

&quot;Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution&quot;, co-authored with Amory Lovins, wrote about the idea of natural capital and direct accounting for ecosystem services. &quot;Natural Capitalism&quot; has been translated into 14 other languages. Together with &quot;The Ecology of Commerce&quot; these books have been described as being &quot;among the first to point the way towards a sustainable global economy&quot;.

&quot;Blessed Unrest, How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming&quot;, published in 2007, argues that a vast &quot;movement with no name&quot; is forming involving environmental, social justice, and indigenous rights organizations. Hawken conceives of this &quot;movement&quot; as developing not by ideology but rather through the identification of what is and is not humane, and has compared it to humanity&#x27;s collective immune system.

&quot;Growing a Business&quot; became the basis of a 17-part PBS series, which Hawken hosted and produced. The program, which explored the challenges and pitfalls of starting and operating socially responsible companies, appeared on television in 115 countries and reached more than 100 million people.

Hawken co-created Project Drawdown in 2013 with Amanda Joy Ravenhill, and was the co-creator, author, and editor of &quot;Drawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reverse Global Warming&quot;, published in 2017. It was collaborative effort involving 200 researchers and advisors who came together to model the most substantive solutions to reverse global warming.

In 2021, Hawken published the New York Times Bestseller, &quot;Regeneration: Ending the Climate Crisis in One Generation&quot;.

Hawken&#x27;s books have been published in more than 50 countries in 30 languages.

=== Business ===
Hawken founded several companies, starting when he took over a small retail store in Boston in 1967 called Erewhon (after Samuel Butler&#x27;s 1872 utopian novel) and turned it into the Erewhon Trading Company, a natural-foods wholesaler, and one of the first in the US that relied solely on sustainable agricultural methods. When he left the company in the 1970s, it had over 30,000 acres of organically grown food under contract. Hawken co-founded the Smith &amp; Hawken garden supply company in 1979, a retail and catalog business. In 2009, he founded OneSun, an energy company focused on ultra low-cost solar based on green chemistry and biomimicry.

From 1994 to 1998, Hawken founded and headed up The Natural Step USA. From 1996 to 1998, Hawken was co-chairman of The Natural Step International. The Natural Step was founded in 1989 by Swedish scientist and medical doctor Karl-Henrik Robèrt in order to create shared frameworks for understanding sustainable development. Its purpose is to teach and support environmental systems thinking in corporations, cities, governments, unions, and academic institutions through a dialogue process rooted in basic science.

In 1998, Hawken created the Natural Capital Institute located in Sausalito, California. Its main focus was wiser.org, an open-source database of activists and civil society organizations focused on environmental and social justice.

Hawken was previously the executive director of Project Drawdown, which is working towards the drawdown of greenhouse gases to reduce climate change.

=== Activism ===
In 1965, Hawken worked with Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s staff in Selma, Alabama, preparing for the Selma to Montgomery marches. As press coordinator, he registered members of the press, issued credentials, gave dozens of updates and interviews on national radio, and acted as marshal for the final, March, 21, March to Montgomery. That same year, Hawken worked in New Orleans as a staff photographer for the Congress of Racial Equality, focusing on voter registration drives in Bogalusa, Louisiana, and the panhandle of Florida, and photographing the Ku Klux Klan in Meridian, Mississippi, after three civil rights workers were tortured and killed. In Meridian, Hawken was assaulted and seized by Ku Klux Klan members, but escaped due to Federal Bureau of Investigation surveillance and intervention.

=== Speaking ===
As a speaker, Hawken has given several hundred talks, including keynote addresses to major associations, companies, government agencies. His University commencement addresses have included:
* University of California, Berkeley commencement
* University of Portland 2009 commencement speech (&quot;You Are Brilliant and the Earth Is Hiring&quot;)
* Urban Land Institute
* Yale University and Yale University commencement

==Recognition==
Hawken has been awarded six honorary doctorates, and received the Green Cross Millennium Award for Individual Environmental Leadership presented by Mikhail Gorbachev in 2003.

<text>The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) is a laboratory in the Earth Sciences Division of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center affiliated with the Columbia University Earth Institute. The institute is located at Columbia University in New York City. It was named after Robert H. Goddard, American engineer, professor, physicist and inventor who is credited with creating and building the world&#x27;s first liquid-fueled rocket.

Research at the GISS emphasizes a broad study of global change, the natural and anthropogenic changes in our environment that affect the habitability of our planet. These effects may occur on greatly differing time scales, from one-time forcings such as volcanic explosions, to seasonal/annual effects such as El Niño, and on up to the millennia of ice ages.

The institute&#x27;s research combines analysis of comprehensive global datasets (derived from surface stations combined with satellite data for sea surface temperatures) with global models of atmospheric, land surface, and oceanic processes. Study of past climate change on Earth and of other planetary atmospheres provides an additional tool in assessing general understanding of the atmosphere and its evolution.

GISS was established in May 1961 by Robert Jastrow to do basic research in space sciences in support of Goddard programs. Formally the institute was the New York City office of the GSFC Theoretical Division but was known as the Goddard Space Flight Center Institute for Space Studies or in some publications as simply the Institute for Space Studies. But even before it opened, the institute had been referred to in the press as the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. It was separated from the Theoretical Division in July 1962. Its offices were originally located in The Interchurch Center, and the institute moved into Columbia&#x27;s Armstrong Hall (a renovated apartment building previously known as the Ostend apartments and subsequently the Oxford Residence Hotel) in April 1966.

From 1981 to 2013, GISS was directed by James E. Hansen. In June 2014, Gavin A. Schmidt was named the institute&#x27;s third director.

== History of scientific research ==

In the 1960s, GISS was a frequent center for high-level scientific workshops, including the &quot;History of the Earth&#x27;s Crust Symposium&quot; in November 1966 which has been described as the meeting that gave birth to the idea of plate tectonics.

At a GISS workshop in 1967, John Wheeler popularized the term &quot;black hole&quot; as a short-hand for &#x27;gravitationally completely collapsed star&#x27;, though the term was not coined there. Hong-Yee Chiu is credited with introducing the term &quot;quasar&quot; while working at GISS in 1964.

In September 1974, at a seminal meeting led by Patrick Thaddeus at GISS with John Mather (his then post-doc) and others discussions began on the possibility of building a satellite to measure both the spectrum and possible spatial fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background. This led directly to the COBE satellite project and a Nobel Prize for Mather.

GISS personnel were involved as instrument and science team scientists in multiple historic NASA solar system missions, Mariner 5 to Venus, Pioneer 10 and 11 to Jupiter and Saturn, the Voyager program, Pioneer Venus, Galileo to Jupiter, the unsuccessful Mars Observer and Climate Orbiter, and Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn.

Polarimetry has been a speciality of GISS since the Pioneer, Voyager, and Galileo missions, and has been adapted to Earth observing missions as well. Notably, Michael Mishchenko of GISS was project scientist for the Glory mission, which failed to reach orbit after launch in 2011. Glory would have employed the Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor (APS) developed by GISS scientists had it reached orbit. More recently, Brian Cairns of GISS is one of the deputy project scientists of the PACE mission, which launched in February 2024 and has two polarimeters on board.

== Climate change research ==
A key objective of Goddard Institute for Space Studies research is prediction of climate change in the 21st century. The research combines paleogeological record, analysis of comprehensive global datasets (derived mainly from spacecraft observations), with global models of atmospheric, land surface, and oceanic processes.

Climate science predictions are based substantially on historical analysis of Earth&#x27;s paleoclimate (climate through geological ages), and the sea-level/ temperature/ carbon dioxide record.

Changes in carbon dioxide associated with continental drift, and the decrease in volcanism as India arrived at the Asian continent, allowed temperatures to drop &amp; Antarctic ice-sheets to form. This resulted in a 75m drop in sea level, allowing our present-day coastlines &amp; habitats to form and stabilize.

Global change studies at GISS are coordinated with research at other groups within the Earth Sciences Division, including the Laboratory for Atmospheres, Laboratory for Hydrospheric and Biospheric Sciences, and Earth Observing System science office.

== Awards ==
GISS director James Hansen received the Heinz Award in 2001.

In November 2004, climatologists Drew Shindell and Gavin Schmidt were named amongst Scientific American magazine&#x27;s Top 50 Scientist award.

One-time GISS post-doctoral scientist John C. Mather was years later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2006.

Climate impacts researcher Cynthia Rosenzweig was awarded the World Food Prize in 2022.

<text>The dwarf loach, ladderback loach, pygmy loach, chain loach or chain botia (Ambastaia sidthimunki) is a freshwater fish belonging to the family Botiidae. Formerly included in the genus &quot;Yasuhikotakia&quot;, it is frequently seen in the aquarium trade, the product of captive breeding.

This endangered species is endemic to the Mae Klong basin (including Khwae Noi River) in Thailand, and the Ataran River on the Thai-Myanmar border. Records from the Mekong basin are misidentifications of the very similar and closely related &quot;A. nigrolineata&quot;.

==Size and habitat==

The dwarf loach can grow up to in length. It prefers water with temperature , pH 6.5 to 6.9 dGH to 8.0. It is omnivorous, with a diet including live crustaceans, insects, snails, etc.

The dwarf loach is found in the Mae Klong River and the Khwae Noi River in western Thailand. This species is endangered and is a protected species in Thailand. It was thought to be extinct in the wild until recently rediscovered in Sangkhla Buri. While they disappeared from the wild, it remained in the aquarium trade because of artificial breeding by private fish farms for over three decades.

The fish was discovered by Somphong Lekaree (สมพงษ์ เล็กอารีย์) and Damri Sukaram (ดำริ สุขอร่าม) in 1959. Lekaree was an aquarium fish exporter while Sukaram was a fisherman for aquarium trade.

The specific epithet of this fish honors Aree Sidthimunk (), a researcher at Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture.

==Related species==

The dwarf loach closely resembles &quot;Ambastaia nigrolineata&quot;, another Thai protected species, especially when the fish is fully grown. The difference is easily seen when the fish is still small. Juveniles of &quot;A. sidthimunki&quot; have dotted patterns while &quot;A. nigrolineata&quot; have horizontal lines on them. Furthermore, the chain pattern of &quot;A. sidthimunki&quot; develops in fish at a smaller size.

<text>Phyllis Nelson (October 3, 1950 – January 12, 1998) was an American singer, most famous for her 1985 song &quot;Move Closer&quot;, which topped the chart in the United Kingdom. Her son is the singer and record producer Marc Nelson, who was a member of Boyz II Men.

==Career==
Nelson was born in Jacksonville, Florida, and a member of family group Nelson Five. She was later a backup singer for Major Harris and Philly Cream. She worked and recorded for several years from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. Her records were mostly dance oriented. She also recorded numerous records during the disco era.

In 1984, she recorded a self-written ballad entitled &quot;Move Closer&quot;. It was a complete departure from the type of music she had been recording. The lyrics of &quot;Move Closer&quot; were based on a long-term love affair she had with a much younger man in Philadelphia, who was struggling to start his own computer business. They lived together for several years, raising Nelson&#x27;s two children (Marc and Kenya) that she had from previous relationships.

While &quot;Move Closer&quot; failed to find an audience in her native United States, it was successful in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at the top of the UK Singles Chart in April 1985. The song remained on the chart for almost six months, and became one of Britain&#x27;s best selling singles of the year.

Based in France, she recorded a single with the French actor Alain Delon: &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;. It was included in the original soundtrack of the 1985 French film &quot;Parole De Flic&quot; (Cop&#x27;s Honor). Her subsequent releases failed to make any impression (except &quot;I Like You&quot; which made No. 81), and she is remembered as a one-hit wonder.

In the United States, she had success on the Hot Dance Club Play chart, where her song &quot;I Like You&quot; peaked at No. 1 in 1985 and No. 61 on the Hot 100. &quot;Move Closer&quot; returned to the UK chart in 1994, reaching the top 40, after being featured in a television commercial for anti-perspirant.

==Death==
Nelson died in January 1998 at the age of 47 from breast cancer in Los Angeles, California, where she had been living since her divorce.

Her son Marc Nelson also enjoyed a recording career, being a co-founder member of the group Boyz II Men.

<text>The Atlantic and Mexican Gulf Canal Company was a canal project approved February 23, 1876 and owned by Joseph E. Johnston, General Lafayette McLaws and Joseph Shepard of Georgia, and others. The purpose was constructing a canal from the St. Marys river in Georgia, across the Okeefinokee Swamp, and thence westward by the most direct and practicable route, as the company may determine, to connect with the waters of the Gulf of Mexico on the coast of Florida, for the purpose of transporting from the Atlantic to the Gulf along the route indicated, and to market on either side, the timber, lumber and other products of the country, and other commercial products as may be offered, and the convenience of the route may determine of may attract to it.

American politician, journalist and industrialist Duff Green also worked with the Gulf Canal Company, hoping to connect the Savannah River with St. Marys and Suwannee Rivers to the Gulf of Mexico.

Florida state law chapter 3500, approved March 1, 1883, gave the company, together with George F. Drew, Jesse J. Finley and George Rainsford Fairbanks of Florida and James S. Bailey of Georgia authority to build the canal in Florida and to extend it along the Gulf coast as far as the western limits of the State, and to connect with any water way which would communicate with Mobile or New Orleans.
The company was promised land grants along its line, provided it selected the route within one year, ten miles were finished within two years, and the canal was completed within ten years.

Florida state law chapter 3647, approved February 16, 1885, amended the list of owners to remove George R. Fairbanks and James S. Bailey and add S. A. Swann of Florida and S. L. Burns, Alex Curtis and William Rogers of Savannah, Georgia. Time limits were extended to three years, four years, and ten years.

<text>Július Satinský (20 August 1941 in Bratislava – 29 December 2002 in Bratislava) was a Slovak actor, comedian, singer, showman and writer. He is mostly remembered in Slovakia as a member of the legendary comedian duo Milan Lasica - Július Satinský, however his scope of interest was wide. He died on 29 December 2002 due to colon cancer.

Asteroid 15946 Satinský is named after him.

== Life ==
He studied drama theory at the Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava (VŠMU). He started his acting career alongside Milan Lasica in 1959, with whom he formed a comic duo. They performed in the &quot;Divadlo na Korze&quot; theatre (presently &quot;Astorka Korzo 90´&quot;) until the late 1960s.

After 1968 (see Prague Spring, Normalization (Czechoslovakia)), the duo was partly banned from working in the Slovak part of Czechoslovakia and performed for two years in a cabaret in the Czech city of Brno. Between 1972 and 1978, Satinský was a member of the musical ensemble of the Nová scéna theatre and between 1978 and 1980 he was a member of the drama company of this theatre and of the Korzo 90 theatre in Bratislava.

When they were allowed to appear on stage again in 1982, they moved to the newly established &quot;Štúdio S&quot; theatre, of which Lasica was director.

Satinský was not only known as an actor and comedian but also as a radio and TV host, a lecturer who travelled around Slovakia to discuss questions about democracy and civil society and as an author of memoirs about his childhood and student years in Bratislava as well as of feuilletons. Along with Milan Lasica he sang on several music albums, the most successful being &quot;Bolo nás jedenásť (There used to be eleven of us)&quot; with music by Jaroslav Filip.

On 2 January 2002, he received the state award Pribina Cross of the First Class for his lifetime contribution to Slovak art and support for civil society.

<doc id="1230529" wikidata="Q580296" url="?curid=1230529" title="Scandinavism">
<text>Scandinavism (; ; ), also called Scandinavianism or pan-Scandinavianism, is an ideology that supports various degrees of cooperation among the Scandinavian countries. Scandinavism comprises the literary, linguistic and cultural movement that focuses on promoting a shared Scandinavian past, a shared cultural heritage, a common Scandinavian mythology and a common language or dialect continuum (from the common ancestor language of Old Norse) and which led to the formation of joint periodicals and societies in support of Scandinavian literature and languages. The movement was most popular among Danes and Swedes.

== History ==
According to historian Sverre Bagge, prior to the formation of state-like kingdoms in Scandinavia, Scandinavia was culturally and linguistically homogeneous. Even in the thirteenth century the term ‘Danish tongue’ was used for the language throughout the area. There were different dialects, but the lines of division between them did not correspond to the later national borders. Religion and customs were also similar, during the pagan as well as the Christian periods. Thus, no cultural or linguistic distinctions prevented unification of each country. Nor, on the other hand, did such distinctions give rise to natural borders between the kingdoms that eventually emerged.Pan-Scandinavianism as a modern movement originated in the 19th century, but the movement had already begun spreading a century earlier in circles of literature and science. The Pan-Scandinavian movement paralleled the unification movements of Germany and Italy. As opposed to the German and Italian counterparts, the Scandinavian state-building project was not successful and is no longer pursued. It was at its height in the mid-19th century and supported the idea of Scandinavian unity.

The movement was initiated by Danish and Swedish university students in the 1840s, with a base in Scania. In the beginning, the political establishments in the two countries, including the absolute monarch Christian VIII and Charles XIV John with his &quot;one man government&quot;, were suspicious of the movement. The movement was a significant force from 1846 to 1864, however the movement eventually dwindled and only had strong support among the Swedish-speaking population of Finland.

The collapse of Pan-Scandinavianism came in 1864 when the Second Schleswig-Holstein War broke out. King Charles XV of Sweden (who was also King Charles IV of Norway), who reigned from 1859 until his death in 1872, in spite of championing Pan-Scandinivianism, failed to help Denmark in the war.

Author Hans Christian Andersen became an adherent of Scandinavism after a visit to Sweden in 1837, and committed himself to writing a poem that would convey the relatedness of Swedes, Danes and Norwegians. It was in July 1839, during a visit to the island of Funen in Denmark, that Andersen first wrote the text of his poem, &quot;Jeg er en Skandinav&quot; (&quot;I am a Scandinavian&quot;). Andersen composed the poem to capture &quot;the beauty of the Nordic spirit, the way the three sister nations have gradually grown together&quot;, as part of a Scandinavian national anthem. Composer Otto Lindblad set the poem to music, and the composition was published in January 1840. Its popularity peaked in 1845, after which it was seldom sung.

In 1923, the Clara Lachmann Foundation was established with the goal of promoting Scandinavian unity through culture.

<doc id="1230533" wikidata="Q123229" url="?curid=1230533" title="Farnborough, London">
<text>Farnborough is a village in Greater London, England. Situated south of Locksbottom, west of Green Street Green, north of Downe and Hazelwood, and east of Keston, it is centred southeast of Charing Cross.

Suburban development following the Second World War resulted in the area becoming almost contiguous with the Greater London conurbation, but the village is still surrounded by open farmland. The area has formed part of the London Borough of Bromley local authority district since the formation of the ceremonial county of Greater London for administrative purposes in 1965.

==History==

The village name derives from Fearnbiorginga, meaning a village among the ferns on the hill. Old records date from 862 when Ethelbert, King of Wessex, gave away 950 acres at Farnborough. The village was not included in the Domesday Book of 1086, but the manor existed in the Middle Ages and was held in the 13th century by Simon de Montfort.

The village evolved on the main road from London to Hastings which originally ran via Church Road and Old Hill (to the south of the village). 
The George pub existed in the 16th century and was used as a coaching inn. Coaches and horses were accommodated later. In 1639 a severe storm destroyed St Giles&#x27; Church –it was later rebuilt.

The population of the parish was as follows:

Suburban development occurred in the post-Second World War years, resulting in the village becoming almost contiguous with the London conurbation, however Green Belt legislation prevented any further development southwards.
On March 30th 2008, a Cessna Citation carrying 5 people onboard crashed into a house in the village. All 5 people on board died, including former racers Richard Lloyd and David Leslie.

==Local government==

Farnborough formed a civil parish in the Ruxley hundred of Kent. In 1840 the parish was included in the Metropolitan Police District. It was part of the Bromley rural sanitary district and went on to form part of the Bromley Rural District from 1894 to 1934. The parish was abolished in 1934 under a county review order, following the Local Government Act 1929, and its area was split between the Municipal Borough of Bromley (3 acres) and Orpington Urban District (1,426 acres). The entire area has formed part of the London Borough of Bromley in Greater London since 1965.

==In film==
On 1 May 1933, British Pathé released &quot;As Befits a Romany Queen&quot;. The subject was the funeral of Urania Boswell, wife of Levi Boswell, of Willow Walk, behind Princess Royal University Hospital, on 24 April. She was the last Queen of the Kent (England) Gypsies (Romani People). The film lasts just under two minutes, and follows the cortège into Saint Giles the Abbott Church, where the gravestone may still be found, very near to the war memorial.

<text>Daniel Howard Yergin (born February 6, 1947) is an American author, economic historian, and consultant within the energy and economic sectors. Yergin is vice chairman of S&amp;P Global. He was formerly vice chairman of IHS Markit, which merged with S&amp;P in 2022. He founded Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which IHS Markit acquired in 2004. He has authored or co-authored several books on energy and world economics, including the Pulitzer Prize–winning &quot;The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power,&quot; (1991) &quot;The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World&quot; (2011), and &quot;The New Map: Energy, Climate, and the Clash of Nations&quot; (2020).

Yergin&#x27;s articles and op-eds on energy, history, and the economy have been published in publications such as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. All of Yergin&#x27;s books have been drafted in long-hand. He is affiliated with multiple organizations, as a director on the United States Energy Association, a trustee of the Brookings Institution, a long-term advisor to several U.S. administrations, as well as chairman of the annual CERAWeek energy conference.

==Early life and education==
Yergin was born on February 6, 1947, in Los Angeles, California. His father Irving Yergin worked at Warner Brothers and was editor of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and a former journalist in Chicago. His mother Naomi Yergin was a sculptor and painter. He attended Beverly Hills High School. He received his B.A. from Yale University in 1968, where he wrote for the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; and was founder of &quot;The New Journal&quot; in 1967. 

He received his M.A. in 1970 and his Ph.D. in international history from Cambridge University, where he was a Marshall Scholar. While at Cambridge, he wrote for various British magazines as well as &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, where he was a contributing editor, and &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. He has honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Colorado School of Mines, University of Houston, and the University of Missouri.

==Career==
===1970s===
Early in his career, Yergin worked as a contributing editor for &quot;New York&quot; magazine. Through 1980, he was a lecturer at the Harvard Business School and, until 1985, a lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School. Yergin&#x27;s first book, &quot;Shattered Peace: The Origins of the Cold War and the National Security State&quot; (1977), was partly based upon his doctoral dissertation and focused on the origins of the Cold War. 

In the mid-1970s, while a post-doctoral fellow, he began to take a particular interest in energy in his writing. Basing the book on four years of research, with Robert B. Stobaugh he co-authored and co-edited &quot;Energy Future: The Report of the Energy Project at the Harvard Business School&quot; in 1979. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the book &quot;caused a considerable stir with its optimistic view of the possibilities of energy conservation and such alternative sources as solar power.&quot; It proved to be a &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller, ultimately selling 300,000 copies in six languages.

Within its first year of release, Yergin and Stobaugh were called to Washington, D.C. several times to testify before Congressional committees. He also advised James Schlesinger, the first US energy secretary, around the time of the Iranian revolution. According to &quot;Reuters&quot;, &quot;since then he has given advice to every administration.&quot;

===1980s–1990s===
He founded Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) with Jamey Rosenfield in 1982 with the purchase of a $2 file cabinet from The Salvation Army. With Yergin as president, the energy research and consulting firm was created as a &quot;quasi think-tank and source of energy industry analysis.&quot;

Yergin is arguably best known for his fourth book, &quot;The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power&quot; (1991). It became a number-one bestseller that won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1992 and the Eccles Prize for the best book on economics for a general audience, selling around 700,000 copies in 17 languages. The book was adapted into a PBS/BBC series seen by around 100 million viewers both domestically and internationally, with Yergin as the principal storyteller. His next book was &quot;Russia 2010 and What It Means for the World&quot; (1993), written with Thane Gustafson, which provided scenarios for the development of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

===2000s–2010s===
His 2002 book &quot;The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy&quot;, written with Joseph Stanislaw, described in narrative form the struggle over the &quot;frontier&quot; between governments and markets and the rise of globalization. In the &quot;first major PBS series on business in more than a decade,&quot; he led the team that created an Emmy-winning six-hour PBS/BBC television series based on the book, serving as executive producer and co-writer and interviewing individuals such as Bill Clinton, Dick Cheney, Vicente Fox, and Mikhail Gorbachev.

CERA was acquired by the information company IHS Inc. in 2004, with Yergin becoming an executive of the combined company and remaining chairman of CERA. Described as a sequel to his book &quot;The Prize,&quot; Yergin&#x27;s &quot;The Quest: Energy, Security, and the Remaking of the Modern World&quot; (2011) continued his history of the global oil industry but also addressed energy security, natural gas, electric power, climate change and the search for renewable sources of energy. Like his previous books, it was drafted in long-hand. In 2011 it was shortlisted for the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award.

===2020s===

In September 2020, Yergin published &quot;The New Map: Energy, Climate, and the Clash of Nations,&quot;with a revised edition published the following year. In December 2024, Yergin released an unabridged audiobook version of &quot;The Prize&quot;. The audiobook includes an epilogue narrated by Yergin reflecting on the relevance of the book’s messaging present day, more than 30 years after its original publication date.

==Viewpoints and research==
Yergin&#x27;s articles and op-eds on energy, history, and the economy have been published in a variety of publications, including &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, and &quot;Forbes&quot;. He has also been interviewed about energy policy and international politics on various television programs. In 2003 he became CNBC&#x27;s global energy expert, which he continued to do for a decade, and in September 2011 he appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to discuss wind and solar power.

In a 2011 essay published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Yergin criticized predictions of imminent peak oil. Instead of a peak, Yergin predicted that future oil production would plateau as increasing prices moderate demand and stimulate production. He also addressed peak oil in a chapter in &quot;The Quest&quot; entitled &quot;Is the World Running Out of Oil?&quot;

In 2019, Yergin and former U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz led a major 229-page study, &quot;Advancing the Landscape of Clean Energy Innovation&quot;, which was conducted by IHS Markit and Energy Futures Initiative for the Breakthrough Energy coalition, led by Bill Gates. The study identified ten areas for transformational energy breakthroughs. &quot;Axios&quot; quoted Yergin, &quot;The purpose of the report is to provide a framework and a guide to people who want to invest in clean energy innovation.&quot;

Yergin chaired IHS Markit&#x27;s study on &quot;Reinventing the Wheel,&quot; which focused on changing transportation methods, the role of electric vehicles, and the timing of peak oil demand.

==Memberships and directorships==
Yergin is the current vice chairman of S&amp;P Global, appointed during the company&#x27;s merger with IHS Markit. He became the vice chairman of IHS in 2012 and remained vice chairman when IHS merged with Markit in 2016. He is also chairman of S&amp;P&#x27;s annual CERAWeek energy conference.

He previously chaired the US Department of Energy&#x27;s Task Force on Strategic Energy Research and Development. He is a trustee of the Brookings Institution, where he chairs the energy security roundtable. He is currently a director on the United States Energy Association and the U.S.-Russia Business Council.

He serves on the National Petroleum Council, which advises the U.S. Secretary of Energy. He is on the advisory boards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative, and the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy. Yergin has been a member of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board under presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump. In December 2016 Yergin joined a business forum composed primarily of CEOs assembled to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues to President Donald Trump. The forum was disbanded in August 2017.

== Awards ==
Yergin was awarded the 1997 United States Energy Award for &quot;lifelong achievements in energy and the promotion of international understanding.&quot; The International Association for Energy Economics gave Dr. Yergin its 2012 award for &quot;outstanding contributions to the profession of energy economics and to its literature.&quot; In 2014 the Prime Minister of India presented Yergin with a Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 2015 the University of Pennsylvania presented him with the first Carnot Prize for &quot;distinguished contributions to energy policy.&quot; The U.S. Department of Energy awarded him the first James Schlesinger Medal for Energy Security in 2014.

In 2023, Yergin received the Pioneer Award from Southern Methodist University.

In 2024, he received the Centennial Lifetime Achievement Award from the United States Energy Association on the occasion of its hundredth anniversary.

<text>The Jacksonville and Atlantic Railroad is a railroad subsumed in 1899 into Florida East Coast Railway. The company was incorporated under the general incorporation laws of Florida for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating a railroad for public use in the conveyance of persons and property, from the south bank of the river St. Johns opposite the city of Jacksonville, Duval County, Florida, to a point on the Atlantic, at or near section 33, township 2, south, range 29, east. Florida state law chapter 3640, approved January 29, 1885, gave the company enlarged powers, including running boats across the St. Johns River.

The company was organized by John Q. Burbridge, J. J. Daniel, James M. Schumacher, H. S. Ely, F. F. L&#x27;engle, S. B. Hubbard, M. M. Drew, P. McQuaid, W. T. Forbes and W. A. McDuff. The narrow gauge line was built with 35 pound rail and ran 16.25 miles from South Jacksonville to Pablo Beach.

The J&amp;A was sold at foreclosure on December 5, 1892, and reorganized as the Jacksonville and Atlantic Railroad Company. In 1897, the new company&#x27;s officers and directors were: J. W, Archibald, President and General Manager; B. P. Hazeltine, Vice-President; W. A. McDuff, Secretary and Treasurer; and W. B. Barnett, all of Jacksonville. The road owned two locomotives, five passenger coaches, one baggage car, and twelve freight cars.

In 1899 the J&amp;A was bought by Henry Flagler, whose Florida East Coast Railway converted the line to and extended the line north to Mayport.

<text>Ahava rabbah (Hebrew: אהבה רבה, &quot;[with an] abundant love&quot;, also Ahavah raba and other variant English spellings) is the name given in Ashkenazi Jewish custom to the blessing recited immediately before the Shema as part of the Shacharit (morning) prayer. The name is taken from the first words of the prayer.

In Sephardi custom and for many of those whose follow Nusach Sefard, the text of the same blessing differs slightly, and the blessing&#x27;s name and initial words are &quot;Ahavat Olam&quot; (not to be confused with the shorter blessing of Ahavat Olam recited by both Sefardim and Ashkenazim during Maariv).

Some claim that text of this prayer was fixed in the period of the Geonim.

In the Jerusalem Talmud this blessing is referred to by the name &quot;birkat torah&quot;.

==Content==
This prayer is an expression of thanks for the love God has given the people. It thanks God for the gift of the Torah, which provides life, and for making the Jewish people the chosen nation.

The prayer contains multiple requests to God. One of them is to be enlightened with the Torah. Another is for God to protect us from shame; it is stated that those who cleave to a life of mitzvot will not be shamed. Another is that the Jewish people be gathered from the four corners of the world and returned to Israel.

Hebrew text according to Nusach Ashkenaz: 

English translation:

==Practices and laws==

In Nusach Ashkenaz, Ahava rabbah is recited during Shacharit, and Ahavat Olam during Maariv. The Talmud provides differing views on which one should be recited. As a compromise, Ahava Rabbah (being the longer of the two) is recited in the morning, and Ahavat Olam in the evening. In the Sephardic rite, as well and many Nusach Sefard communities, Ahavat Olam is recited in both the morning and the evening.

In many communities, during Ahava rabbah, at the words &quot;Bring us in peace from the four corners of the earth [to our land]&quot;, the four corners of the tzitzit are gathered in one&#x27;s hand. They are held throughout the Shema and kissed four times during the third paragraph of the Shema and once during Emet Veyatziv (the paragraph following the Shema) and then released. The gathering of the tzitzit on these words is symbolic of the gathering of the Jewish people to its land.

Ahava rabbah is recited immediately before the Shema because its recital brings on the obligation to immediately learn, or at the very least, recite verses from the Torah. Since the Shema is composed of verses from the Torah, its recital fulfills that obligation.

The recitation of Ahava Rabbah fulfills the mitzvah of saying a blessing before Torah study. Normally, verses from the Torah are recited during Birkat HaShachar. But if one forgets to recite these verses then, the obligation is met through the recitation of Ahava Rabbah. However, the recitation of the Shema does &quot;not&quot; meet the requirement for learning after reciting the blessing on Torah study, even though it is composed of verses from the Torah, and one must learn something immediately following prayers in order for Ahava Rabbah to work in this capacity.

In Nusach Ashkenaz, a special piyyut (called an &quot;ahavah&quot;) is inserted before the conclusion of this blessing on special sabbaths. Most notable are the &quot;ahavah&quot; piyyutim recited in the Eastern Ashkenazic rite on the sabbaths between Passover and Shavuot - these poems include a dialogue between the Jewish people and God, where the Jewish people complain that the persecution has become so difficult and ask for redemption and God comforts them.

<text>Viktor Hermann Brack (9 November 1904 – 2 June 1948) was a member of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and a convicted Nazi war criminal and one of the prominent organisers of the involuntary euthanasia programme Aktion T4; this Nazi initiative resulted in the systematic murder of 275,000 to 300,000 disabled people. He held various positions of responsibility in Hitler&#x27;s Chancellery in Berlin. Following his role in the T4 programme, Brack was one of the men identified as responsible for the gassing of Jews in extermination camps, having conferred with Odilo Globočnik about its use in the practical implementation of the Final Solution. Brack was sentenced to death in 1947 in the Doctors&#x27; Trial and executed by hanging in 1948.

==Early life and Nazi Party membership==
Brack was born the son of a physician in Haaren (now part of Aachen) in the Rhine Province. In 1928, he completed a degree in agriculture at the Technical University of Munich and shortly thereafter began managing the estate attached to his father&#x27;s sanatorium; he also was a test driver for BMW.

In 1929 at the age of 25, Brack became a member of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). Throughout 1930 and 1931, Brack was one of Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s personal drivers, having become acquainted with the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; as a consequence of his father having delivered one of the SS leader&#x27;s children. Sometime in 1932, he became adjutant to Philipp Bouhler and by 1934, Brack was his chief of staff. In 1936, he was appointed chief of &quot;Hauptamt II&quot; (main office II) in the Chancellery of the Führer in Berlin. The office handled matters concerning the Reich Ministries, Wehrmacht, NSDAP, clemency petitions and complaints received by the Führer from all parts of Germany.

==Aktion T4==
&quot;Hauptamt II&quot; officials under Viktor Brack played a vital role in organising the killing of mentally ill and physically handicapped people in the Aktion T4 &quot;euthanasia&quot; programme, especially the child &quot;euthanasia&quot; from 1939. By a (backdated) decree of 1 September, Hitler appointed Philipp Bouhler and his personal physician Karl Brandt to manage the euthanasia program, where they would oversee the murder of physically and/or mentally disabled persons. The implementation of the killing operations was left to subordinates such as Brack and SA-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Werner Blankenburg. To efficiently accomplish this task, Brack, who headed Office II of the Führer&#x27;s Chancellery created four offices; these were Office IIa or the Deputy Chief of Central Office II, headed by Blankenburg ; Office IIb, led by Hans Hefelmann, which dealt with the Reich government and clemency petitions; Office IIc, overseen by Reinhold Vorberg, responsible for matters related to the armed forces, the police, the SS, and churches; and Office IId for matters concerning the Nazi Party, which was headed by &quot;Amtsleiter&quot; Buchholz and then by Dr. Brümmel.

In January 1940, Brack gave August Becker the task of arranging gas-killing operations of mentally ill patients and other people whom the Nazis deemed &quot;life unworthy of life&quot;. The Aktion T4 program was related to popular early 20th-century ideas of eugenics and improving the race, not allowing disabled or mentally ill people to reproduce. Initially, the doctors in the program sterilized people, but then they murdered nearly 15,000 German citizens at Hadamar Euthanasia Centre under an extension of this program. 

On 3 April 1940, Brack explained to leading members of the German Council of Municipalities his justification for murdering persons deemed permanently mentally ill. Among material considerations, Brack outlined how they &quot;deprived&quot; others of food (useless eaters), and unnecessarily took up space at hospitals for otherwise curable people. Beyond those reasons, Brack added the ideological components of racial hygiene as grounds for their extermination, atop stressing the importance of the war effort above humanitarian factors. 

There were six principal killing centers; these resided at Hartheim, Sonnenstein, Grafeneck, Bernburg, Brandenburg, and Hadamar; most of which, historian Robert Lifton points out, &quot;were in isolated areas and had high walls—some had originally been old castles—so that what happened within could not be readily observed from without.&quot; Given the scale of the operation, Brack recruited personnel using his network of contacts and party connections to fully staff T4, none of whom were forced to participate but volunteered their services. The T4 killings took place from September 1939 until the end of the war in 1945; from 275,000 to 300,000 people were killed in psychiatric hospitals in Germany and Austria, occupied Poland and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (now the Czech Republic).

==Role in the Holocaust==
During October 1941, Adolf Eichmann and Brack decided to begin using &quot;gas vans&quot; to murder Jews incapable of working, the first three of which were set up at Chełmno extermination camp. Not only did the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; mobile units assigned there kill Jews, but they also gassed Gypsies, people suffering from typhus, Soviet POWs, and the insane; all of whom were led into the vans, murdered, and then driven to nearby woods so their bodies could be placed in mass graves. On 23 June 1942 Brack wrote the following letter to Himmler:

Brack only intended to spare these 2–3 million Jews capable of work provided they were accordingly sterilized. Following these recommendations, Himmler ordered the procedure to be tested on prisoners in Auschwitz. Since Brack was transferred to an SS division, his deputy Blankenburg took over responsibility for the task and would &quot;immediately take the necessary measures and get in touch with the chiefs of the main offices of the concentration camps&quot;. When sterilization proved impracticable, this was rejected in favor of exterminating the Jews using poison gas, since the technical apparatus was already in place via T4 to kill unwanted &quot;mentally ill&quot; persons. With the completion of the T4 euthanasia programme run by Brack, the Nazis dismantled the gas chambers previously used for that endeavor, shipped them east, and reinstalled them at Majdanek, Auschwitz, and Treblinka. Brack subsequently took part in the administrative process of establishing extermination camps in occupied Poland. It was personnel and equipment provided by Brack that were utilized to murder the Jews.

==Trial and execution==

Sometime in April 1945, Viktor Brack and his superior Phillip Bouhler were arrested. During the Eichberg trial, which concluded at Frankfurt on 21 December 1946, Brack was implicated for his role in recruiting physicians for the euthanasia killings. At the Hadamar Trial—between 24 February 1947 until 21 March 1947—he was again implicated along with Dr. Karl Brandt for his involvement in the T4 programme. Brack was known to radically enforce euthanasia, even terrorizing doctors and nurses to ensure they maintained the killing procedures, despite later claiming during the trials that he had never even heard of the T4 programme.

During the trials, Brack insisted that euthanasia was a &quot;humane measure&quot; for incurably sick people and denied all knowledge of the Holocaust. He contested his complicity in mass X-ray sterilizations until confronted by his signature on corresponding documents; meanwhile other administrators—Rudolf Brandt and Wolfram Sievers—testified against Brack, proving links between him, the Führer&#x27;s Chancellery, and Hitler. Nonetheless, Brack denied any anti-Semitism or involvement with killing Jews and avowed that he had joined the Waffen-SS in 1942 to distance himself from the regime.

On 20 August 1947, Brack was sentenced to death. He was executed by hanging at Landsberg Prison on 2 June 1948, stating at the gallows that he &quot;wished for God to give peace to the world.&quot;

<text>Lisbon Maru () was a Japanese cargo liner built at Yokohama in 1920 for a Japanese shipping line. During World War II, the ship was requisitioned by the Japanese Army and turned into an armed troopship. On her final voyage, &quot;Lisbon Maru&quot; was being used to transport prisoners of war between Hong Kong and Japan when it was torpedoed by the submarine USS &quot;Grouper&quot; on 1 October 1942. Over 800 British POWs died in the sinking, either by drowning or being shot by Japanese soldiers as they attempted to escape from the sinking ship. Approximately 380 British POWs were rescued by nearby Chinese fishermen, but were soon recaptured by the Japanese. The remaining 644 POWs were salvaged by nearby Japanese naval vessels from the water and taken back into captivity. 

==Construction and commercial service==
&quot;Lisbon Maru&quot; was completed on 8 July 1920 at the Yokohama Dock Company shipyard in Yokohama, Japan as Yard No. 70, entering service for a major Japanese shipping line, Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, and registered at the port of Tokyo.

The ship was long, with a beam of and a depth of . It measured and 4,308 NRT. Twin propellers were powered by a pair of triple expansion steam engines with a combined rating of 632 nhp, giving a service speed of . The engines and four boilers were made by the shipbuilder.

==Sinking and rescuing==
On her final voyage, the &quot;Lisbon Maru&quot; was carrying 700 Japanese Army personnel and 1,816 British prisoners of war captured after the Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941. The POWs were held in &quot;appalling conditions ... [those] at the bottom of the hold ... showered by the diarrhoea of sick soldiers above&quot;.

On 1 October 1942, the ship was torpedoed by the submarine while travelling through the East China Sea. The Japanese troops were evacuated from the ship but the POWs were not; instead the hatches were battened down above them and they were left on the listing ship. After 24 hours, as it became apparent that the ship was sinking, the POWs were able to break through the hatch covers. Some were able to escape from the ship before it sank. The ladder from one of the holds to the deck failed, and the Royal Artillery POWs in the hold could not escape; they were last heard singing &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot;. Survivors reported that Japanese guards first fired on the POWs who reached the deck; and that other Japanese ships used machine guns to fire at POWs who were in the water. Later, however, after some Chinese fishermen started rescuing survivors, the Japanese ships also rescued survivors.

The sinking occurred near the Zhoushan Archipelago, close to the islands of Qingbang and Miaozihu. Upon noticing the black smoke and debris from the wreck, fishermen from these islands spontaneously sailed out to rescue survivors, saving a total of 384 POWs. As more fishing boats approached the wreck site, Japanese ships, which had been shooting at the British POWs in the water, began to pick up survivors. The 384 British POWs rescued by Chinese fishermen were taken into their homes and temples on the islands, where they were provided with food and clothing. Three days later, Japanese gunboats landed on these islands and recaptured 381 of them, while three were hidden and protected by the local residents. These three, J. C. Fallace, W. C.Johnstone, and A. J. W. Evans, eventually made their way back to the UK via Chongqing, the wartime capital of China, in early 1943.

Over 800 of these men died either directly as a result of the sinking, or from being shot or otherwise killed by the Japanese guards while swimming away from the wreck. The ship was not marked to alert Allied forces to the nature of its passengers.

==Aftermath==
A Lisbon Maru memorial is located in the chapel of St Stephen&#x27;s College in Hong Kong. The memorial was originally placed in Stanley Fort, but was moved to St Stephen&#x27;s College with Hong Kong&#x27;s change in sovereignty.

A reunion of &quot;Lisbon Maru&quot; survivors was held on board on 2 October 2007 to mark the 65th anniversary of their escape. Six former prisoners attended, alongside many families of the escapees.

In 2021, a memorial for the &quot;Lisbon Maru&quot; was placed at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, and the unveiling was attended by over 600 family members and military personnel to remember those who died.

==In popular culture==
The album &quot;Tarot Sport&quot; by the British electronic band Fuck Buttons features a track named &quot;The Lisbon Maru&quot;. Band member Benjamin John Power&#x27;s grandfather survived the torpedoing of the ship. The album &quot;War, Peace and Diplomacy&quot; by Tom Hickox features a track named &quot;The Lisbon Maru&quot;, in which a survivor of the sinking relays his tale to a barman.

The documentary film &quot;The Sinking Of The Lisbon Maru&quot;, produced and directed by Fang Li, was released in September 2024 in mainland China, covering the stories of the families affected by the tragedy and shedding light on the rescue of British POWs by Chinese fishermen.

<text>Tribhuvan University (TU; ) is a public university located in Kirtipur, Kathmandu, Nepal. Established in 1959, TU is the oldest and the largest university in Nepal. It offers 1,000 undergraduate and 500 postgraduate programs across a wide range of disciplines. Additionally, the institution has 62 constituent campuses and over 1,080 affiliated colleges across the country.

==History==
Established on 25 June 1959 (or 11 Ashar 2016 BS), Tribhuvan University is the oldest and largest university in Nepal. The university was named after the late King Tribhuvan. In its early years, all the postgraduate classes were held at Tripureshwor Campus, where the administrative office was also located. It was only in 1967 that the university was relocated to its main campus in Kirtipur – an ancient town about 5km south-west of the city of Kathmandu. The university site, spread over 154.77 hectares, constitutes the Central Administrative Office and the Central Campus.

==Academics==

Since its inception, the state-owned university has expanded its programmes. There are five technical institutes and four general faculties. The university offers 115 courses for the technical proficiency certificate level. TU offers 1079 courses at Bachelor&#x27;s level and 1000 courses at Master&#x27;s level. It offers PhD degrees in the technical institutes and faculties.

Tribhuvan University ran its programmes only through its constituent campuses before 1980. With the increasing number of students seeking higher education, it was not possible to accommodate all the students in the constituent campuses. This situation led to the establishment of colleges in the private sector because the constituent campuses alone could not meet the demand. From 1979 to 1980, TU started providing affiliation to private colleges. As of April 2016, 1,084 private and public colleges were affiliated with TU.

In the 2014–2015 academic session 405,341 students were enrolled in TU academic programmes. 148,141 (36.55%) students study in its 60 constituent campuses including 38 central departments, while 257,200 (63.45%) students study in 1,053 affiliated colleges.

Student enrollment and educational quality

Tribhuvan University is the leading University in Nepal. Many colleges are affiliated with Tribhuvan University. In 1971, all the community colleges were part of Tribhuvan University. The university has the largest number of full-time enrollments in the world. The 49th graduation ceremony of Tribhuvan University was on 18 December 2023, in Kathmandu, Nepal. The registrar of Tribhuvan University said more than 73000 students were graduating at that time. The significant number of graduates made Tribhuvan University hold a Guinness World Record.&quot;&quot;

Although the education system of Tribhuvan University has produced many graduates, many of them still need to get jobs in the market. They cannot find jobs in Nepal, so they go abroad to look for financial opportunities. Nepal&#x27;s Public colleges are government-funded, and community colleges are privately funded. Both types of colleges are university-oriented and implement the university curriculum and university exam system. The university&#x27;s education and services, such as business education, employment, training, and vocational education, are not up to date with new technology and career preparation.

TU has 7,841 teaching faculty and 7,413 non-teaching staff including the support staff in its constituent campuses. The number of total employees is 15,254.

==Rankings==

An identification hostel card was provided to make the hostels more organized. Students who come from poor families or remote areas are given the privilege to live in the hostels.

The free student union at Tribhuvan University

Tribhuvan University also has a free student union as another facility. This free student union has established the rights and interests of students who come to study at the university and to solve students&#x27; problems. The committee of the students&#x27; union has to be elected at the university. The university students who are affiliated with different political parties vote for their supporter leaders.

<text>Southeast Georgia&#x27;s Lower Coastal Plain, often referred to as the &quot;Coastal Empire&quot;, is a subregion that encompasses the lowest-lying areas of the Atlantic coastal plain in the state, containing barrier islands, marshes, and swampy lowlands, as well as flat plains and low terraces. It differs from Georgia&#x27;s Upper Coastal Plain in that it is lower in elevation with less relief and wetter soils. The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines the Lower Coastal Plain as an ecoregion, part of the larger, interstate Southern Coastal Plain.

Within the subregion flow the major rivers the Altamaha, Ogeechee, Saint Marys, Savannah, Satilla, and Suwannee (all of which, except the Suwannee River, empty into the Atlantic Ocean); the Saint Marys and Suwannee rivers have their origins in the Okefenokee Swamp. The Coastal Plain is also the home to Savannah, the first capital city which was declared in 1733.

The subregion is somewhat synonymous with Coastal Georgia, and contains the counties of Atkinson, Bacon, Brantley, Camden, Charlton, Clinch, Echols, Glynn, Lanier, Pierce, Ware, and Wayne, south of the Altamaha River; and Bryan, Chatham, Effingham, Liberty, Long, and McIntosh, north of the Altamaha River. The three metropolitan areas are those of Brunswick, Hinesville–Fort Stewart, and Savannah. The largest census county divisions, in the order of decreasing population, are Savannah, Hinesville, Pooler–Bloomingdale, Brunswick, Saint Marys, Waycross, Jesup, Richmond Hill, Tybee Island, and Everett. The total population of the eighteen-county subregion is 726,132 (286,271 south of, and 439,861 north of, the Altamaha River), as of the 2010 U.S. census.

<doc id="1230567" wikidata="Q2106850" url="?curid=1230567" title="Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper">
<text>Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) are documents required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank before a country can be considered for debt relief within the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. PRSPs are also required before low-income countries can receive aid from most major donors and lenders. The IMF specifies that the PRSP should be formulated according to five core principles. The PRSP should be country-driven, result-oriented, comprehensive, partnership-oriented, and based on a long-term perspective. The PRS process encourages countries to develop a more poverty-focused government and to own their own strategies through developing the plan in close consultation with the population. A comprehensive poverty analysis and wide-ranging participation are vital parts of the PRSP formulation process. There are many challenges to PRS effectiveness, such as state capacity to carry out the established strategy. Criticism of PRSP include aid conditionality, donor influence, and poor fulfillment of the participatory aspect.

==Purpose==
The World Bank and IMF require countries to produce a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper as a condition for debt relief through the HIPC initiative and other monetary aid, as do several bilateral donors. PRSPs are intended to help aid recipient countries meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). They detail a country&#x27;s plan to promote growth and reduce poverty through implementation of specific economic, social and structural policies over a period of three years or longer. PRSPs provide lending organizations, like the World Bank and the IMF, assurance that aid receiving countries will utilize aid to pursue development outcomes that have been elaborated in the PRSPs and approved by lenders.

==Goals==
The IMF has outlined five core principles for the process through which PRSPs are elaborated. First, it should be &quot;country-driven&quot;, meaning that country ownership of the strategy should be culminated through broad-based participation of civil society. It should also be &quot;result-oriented&quot; by focusing on outcomes that will benefit the poor, &quot;comprehensive&quot; in exploring and understanding the multidimensional nature of poverty, &quot;partnership-oriented&quot; by involving development partners such as the government, domestic stakeholders, and external donors. Lastly, the development of the PRSP should be based on a &quot;long-term perspective&quot; geared towards reducing poverty. These core principles are central to the goals of the PRS process. 

===Poverty-focused government===
One central goal is to create a more poverty-focused government. Previously, poverty reduction had been largely a marginalized concern within governments of developing countries. Through the PRSP process, the issue of poverty has moved up in priority, creating more comprehensive plans addressing poverty specifically than ever before. There has also been an increase in “pro-poor” spending within the health, education and transportation sectors. Due to the demands from the donors to show results, there has been an increase in poverty monitoring through participatory poverty assessments and household surveys.

===Civil society involvement===
One major function of the PRS is to encourage more participation from the population. The purpose of civil society involvement is to increase the influence of stakeholders in policy creation, program implementation, resource allocation and priority setting. The intent here is to cultivate a degree of national consensus, thereby creating a poverty reduction strategy that is more representative of stakeholder&#x27;s interests. The idea behind this is that the PRS will then be owned by the population and will be sustainable, as it suits the needs and capacities of the country.

===Ownership===
Ownership of the PRSP by the government and population is a very important goal of PRS. It addresses the ineffectiveness of donor imposition of policy conditions from the outside, a common approach of lending organizations. One way the PRS process encourages ownership is by having governments create their own PRSPs in close consultation with the population. This allows them to take ownership over, and thereby stick to, the strategies they and their population deem necessary to improve conditions in their counties. Additionally, the hope is that in developing a PRSP together, a country will gain a more comprehensive understanding of the poverty issues it faces. The PRSP process is also meant to encourage government leadership in implementing their own strategies by allowing them to allocate the aid money themselves in accordance with the strategies they had drawn up in the PRSP. The emphasis on government leadership stems from the problems that arise when donors establish their own strategy implementation agencies within the client countries, bypassing state agencies and therefore undermining the development of state capacity as well as creating a dependency on aid organizations.

==Formulation process==
===Poverty analysis===
The PRSP process begins with an analysis of poverty within the country, taking into account both quantitative and qualitative data. This analysis becomes the basis for the poverty reduction strategy as it indicates the priority issues. It is important at this stage for the government to initiate civil participation, though to the degree with which this is done varies by country.

===Participatory process===
One of the most important factors of the PRSP is the participatory process through which it is created. It is vital to increasing country ownership of the PRS and promote accountability. The World Bank outlines the following participatory levels:

* Government participation, including ministries, parliament and sub-national governments 
* Stakeholder participation and involvement. This can include civil society groups, women’s groups, ethnic minorities, policy research institutes and academics, the private sector, trade unions and representatives from different regions of the country. 
* Participation of bilateral and multilateral external development partners
* Participation and consultation of the poor or their representatives 

Participation has been facilitated by civil society organizations, mainly NGOs. However, since there is no clear framework for consultation with the masses, nor a clear definition of participation, many governments are able to conduct and organize it in whichever way they decide. This often results in governments coordinating selective participation and employing other such tactics aimed at diluting public influence over government objectives. Governments have also been unclear on how much they should incorporate the opinions of the poor into their PRSP, especially while also trying to appease the donors. Furthermore, there is no clear criteria on which to judge whether or not the participatory aspect has been fulfilled in the PRSP. This means that the PRSP might be approved by the IMF and World Bank regardless of the lack of true civil society participation in its making. 

==Content==
According to the World Bank&#x27;s PRS Sourcebook, a PRSP should contain a poverty analysis, a prioritization of the programs needed to achieve development objectives, targets and indicators, a plan for keeping track of progress towards goals and evaluating effectiveness of implementation of programs, and a description of the participatory process in preparing the strategy.

==Criticism and challenges==

Even with an approved PRSP, some countries have difficulty following through with intended policies and therefore do not reach the PRS outcomes. A large factor of this is the misallocation of budgetary funds that were intended to go towards the PRS. 

The PRSP process has been scrutinized for increasing aid conditionality even though it was supposedly created to undo the imposition of policy conditions from the outside by increasing country ownership. Some have argued that it is a &quot;process conditionality&quot; not a &quot;content conditionality&quot;. This differentiation is important because it means donors are only monitoring if the country has made a PRSP and if it was made in a participatory way. However, this might still pose a problem. Since in the past donors were unable to impose content effectively in the client country&#x27;s policies, it seems unlikely that donors would be able to impose process standards in making a PRSP. It has already been shown that donor&#x27;s attempts to influence domestic politics have not been successful in the past. Furthermore, international financial institutions do in fact evaluate PRSP content, not process alone. 
A clear definition of what civil participation means has not been laid out by the IMF or World Bank. This creates a problem when evaluating one of the key requirements of the PRSP, which is that it has to be formulated with civil participation. In fact, participation that involves the population working with the government to develop specific strategies to reduce poverty doesn&#x27;t exist in any developing country. This seems to suggest that the WB and IMF approve PRSPs regardless of the fulfillment of this condition.

<doc id="1230569" wikidata="Q4676372" url="?curid=1230569" title="Acronym Finder">
<text>Acronym Finder (AF) is a free, online, searchable dictionary and database of abbreviations (acronyms, initialisms, and others) and their meanings.

The entries are classified into categories such as &quot;Information Technology, Military/Government, Science, Slang/Pop Culture&quot; etc. It also contains a database of the United States and Canadian postal codes. For abbreviations with multiple meanings, they are listed by popularity, with the most common one being listed first. it claims to have over a million &quot;human-edited&quot; and verified definitions.

==History==
Acronym Finder was registered and the database put online by Michael K. Molloy of Colorado in 1997, but he began compiling it in 1985, working as a computer systems officer for the USAF. Molloy first saw the need of an acronym list while integrating computers at the Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, his first acronym list running up to 30 pages. When he had retired and put AF online in 1997, his list already had 43,000 acronyms. It began mainly as a list of Military/Government abbreviations before expanding to other areas.

Molloy and his wife served as the editors of the website, verifying user submissions for abbreviations and adding others they found to the database. Molloy has also provided opinions on abbreviations such as &quot;MSG&quot; which Madison Square Garden wanted as a domain name (&quot;msg.com&quot;), claiming trademark to the abbreviated letters. He stated that MSG also stood for more common things such as monosodium glutamate and message, among others. The Garden in the end settled out of court and came to own &quot;msg.com&quot;.

The website was maintained under Mountain Data Systems, LLC by Molloy, before being sold off and eventually coming under the ownership of Farlex, Inc. publishers of Thefreedictionary.com.

==Content==
The website contains a database of meanings and expansions for abbreviations, acronyms, initialisms mainly in English but includes some entries in other languages such as French, German, Spanish etc. as well. It is freely accessible. The entries are further classified into categories such as &quot;Information Technology, Military/Government, Science, Slang/Pop Culture&quot; etc. It also contains a database of US and Canadian postal codes which are shown on a Map along with location information. Abbreviations with multiple expansions are listed by popularity with the most common one being presented first, these can be sorted alphabetically as well.

Anyone can contribute to the database by submitting abbreviations and their meanings, these are reviewed by an editor and categorized before being added to the database. While the database has been described as fairly accurate errors have been found in the meanings and expansions of abbreviations. The website does not list sources for the abbreviations and their meanings but it does identify people who have contributed more than 50 abbreviations to the database.

The database only contains abbreviations and their expansions and does not list other data such as grammatical category, context, source, field of the abbreviation etc.

Farlex, Inc. The current owner of the website also publishes mobile apps for the Android and iOS operating systems.

Acronym Finder also includes a &quot;Systematic Buzz Phrase Projector&quot;, a light-hearted tool that randomly generates jargon-like phrases and abbreviations — usually initialisms that would be unpronounceable as acronyms — and meanings from 30 cleverly chosen buzz words.

The website is supported through advertisements.

==Reputation==
The website is listed as a quick reference tool in directories like Stanford Library, Library of Congress, USC Library. It has been cited as the largest database of acronyms and has been used in computational studies for its database.

Listings of abbreviations on the website have also been used as a defense that an abbreviation is in public use and cannot be trademarked. While in some trademark cases citations for AF have been accepted it has been described as an unreliable reference in others.

It has garnered criticism for the fact that anyone can submit abbreviations to the site and the content is user generated. Mike Molloy the site&#x27;s original owner had defended that each submission is verified before being added to the database.

<doc id="1230572" wikidata="Q2003866" url="?curid=1230572" title="Treaty of Sugauli">
<text>The Treaty of Sugauli (also spelled Sugowlee, Sagauli and Segqulee), the treaty that established the boundary line of Nepal, was signed on 4 March 1816 between the East India Company and Guru Gajraj Mishra following the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814–16.

== Background ==
Following the Unification of Nepal under Prithvi Narayan Shah, Nepal attempted to enlarge its domains, conquering much of Sikkim in the east and, in the west, the basins of Gandaki and Karnali and the Uttarakhand regions of Garhwal and Kumaon. This brought them into conflict with the British, who controlled directly or indirectly the north Indian plains between Delhi and Calcutta. A series of campaigns termed the Anglo-Nepalese War occurred in 1814–1816. In 1815 the British general David Ochterlony evicted the Nepalese from Garhwal and Kumaon across the Kali River, ending their 12-year occupation, which is remembered for its brutality and repression.

Octherlony offered peace terms to the Nepalese demanding British suzerainty in the form of a British resident and the delimitation of Nepal&#x27;s territories corresponding roughly to its present-day boundaries. The Nepalese refusal to accede to the terms led to another campaign the following year, targeting the Kathmandu Valley, after which the Nepalese capitulated.

== Terms ==
Historian John Whelpton writes:
== Geographic Context ==
Nepal boasts a salt trade route to Tibet that has been in use for many centuries. This was significant to the economic well-being of the Kathmandu valley. As the British East India Company had profited from Indian trade routes, Nepal&#x27;s trade routes were desirable to conquer.

Nepal was a relatively newly established nation that did not have well-established boundaries with lax enforcement around the supposed borders. In conjunction with its frustration with this, and its desire for the trade routes, the East India Company declared war against Nepal known as the Anglo-Nepalese War from 1814 to 1816. Nepal&#x27;s advantage lay in their highly esteemed army of men known as the Gurkhas who were also of interest to the company. As a smaller and less developed country, Nepal eventually relented in the war and agreed upon a ceasefire under the terms and conditions of the Sugauli Treaty.

== Reasons the Treaty was Signed ==
Three of the main goals of the company were to employ Nepal&#x27;s impressive army, establish a presence of supervision in the Nepali court, and utilise its trading routes to Tibet. Naturally, the decision to sign the treaty was not treated with full acceptance by the Nepali court and roused a large point of controversy. Bhimsen Thapa, Nepal&#x27;s prime minister at the time “realised that the best way to ensure Nepal’s continued freedom from interference was to grant the governor-general’s basic desire, a secure and trouble-free border”. In attempts to mitigate the devastation to Nepal&#x27;s sovereignty and security, the treaty was signed.

From the British perspective, the costs of colonising Nepal were impractical in comparison to placing certain aspects under British employment.

== Effects of the Treaty ==
The treaty stipulated that Nepal&#x27;s government structure be without external interference and that aside from the singular British resident in the Nepali court, their national affairs would not be compromised. In addition to the benefit of Nepal&#x27;s continued sovereign independence, an alliance was established between the two governments.

== Aftermath ==
The treaty saw three decades of peace following its implementation, however, other issues began to arise starting in 1840.  “An army mutiny over proposed pay reductions almost turned into an attack on the British residency because the soldiers were led to believe that the cuts had been forced on the Nepalese government by the British” in June 1840&quot; This followed as a result of suspicions that arose in the Nepali court that its independence in internal government affairs was being infringed upon. Another incidence of alarm occurred in 1842 during a debt lawsuit over an Indian Merchant, Kasinath Mull. The British resident in the Nepalese court, Brian Hodgson appeared hostile and assertive, implicating attempted control over the independence of decision in the court. Through these issues, the success of the treaty&#x27;s attempt to buffer tensions may still be debated.

=== Boundary Treaty of 1860 ===
During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a division of Gurkha soldiers was sent to the war in support of the British and aided in its success, establishing a friendlier form of diplomacy that ultimately called for a revision in the Sugauli Treaty that panned more positively in favor of Nepal&#x27;s independence and territorial integrity. This would be called the Boundary Treaty of 1860.

=== Ongoing disputes ===

Among the border dispute of the Indo-Nepal boundary, the most significant are in the Susta and Kalapani regions. The two regions cover some 40 km of the Indo-Nepal border.

<doc id="1230576" wikidata="Q1416219" url="?curid=1230576" title="Kurdish alphabets">
<text>Kurdish is written using either of two alphabets: the Latin-based Bedirxan or Hawar alphabet, introduced by Celadet Alî Bedirxan in 1932 and popularized through the Hawar magazine, and the Kurdo-Arabic alphabet. The Kurdistan Region has agreed upon a standard for Central Kurdish, implemented in Unicode for computation purposes.
The Hawar alphabet is primarily used in Syria and Turkey, while the Kurdo-Arabic alphabet is commonly used in Iraq and Iran. The Hawar alphabet is also used to some extent in Iraqi Kurdistan. Two additional alphabets, based on the Armenian and Cyrillic scripts, were once used by Kurds in the Soviet Union, most notably in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic and Kurdistansky Uyezd.

== Hawar alphabet==
Usually it is the northern languages spoken by Kurds, Zazaki and Kurmanji, that are written in the extended Latin alphabet consisting of the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin Alphabet with 5 letters with diacritics, for a total of 31 letters (each having an uppercase and a lowercase form):

In this alphabet the short vowels are E, I and U while the long vowels are A, Ê, Î, O and Û (see the IPA equivalents in the table).

When presenting the alphabet in his magazine &quot;Hawar&quot;, Celadet Alî Bedirxan proposed using diacritics on to distinguish the Arabic and sounds (see page 12, 13). These are not considered letters, but are used to disambiguate loanwords that would otherwise be conflated.

Turkey does not recognize this alphabet. Using the letters Q, W, and X, which did not exist in the Turkish alphabet until 2013, led to a trial in 2000 and 2003 (see , p. 8, and ). Since September 2003, many Kurds applied to the courts seeking to change their names to Kurdish ones written with these letters, but failed.

The Turkish government finally legalized the letters Q, W, and X as part of the Turkish alphabet in 2013.

===History===
The Kurdish Latin alphabet was elaborated mainly by Celadet Bedirxan who initially had sought the cooperation of Tewfîq Wehbî, who in 1931 lived in Iraq. But after not having received any responses by Wehbî for several months, he and his brother Kamuran Alî Bedirxan decided to launch the &quot;Hawar&quot; alphabet in 1932. Celadet Bedirxan aimed to create an alphabet that did not use two letters for representing one sound. As the Kurds in Turkey already learned the Turkish Latin alphabet, he created an alphabet which would specifically be accessible for the Kurds in Turkey. Some scholars have suggested making minor additions to Bedirxan&#x27;s alphabet to make it more user-friendly.

==Kurdo-Arabic alphabet==

Many Kurdish varieties, mainly Sorani, are written using a modified Perso-Arabic script with 33 letters introduced by Sa&#x27;id Kaban Sedqi. Unlike the Persian alphabet, which is an abjad, Central Kurdish is almost a true alphabet in which vowels are given the same treatment as consonants. Written Central Kurdish also relies on vowel and consonant context to differentiate between the phonemes u/w and î/y instead of using separate letters. It does show the two pharyngeal consonants, as well as a voiced velar fricative, used in Kurdish.

A new sort order for the alphabet was proposed some time ago by the Kurdish Academy as the new standard, all of which are letters accepted included in the Central Kurdish Unicode Keyboard:

The alphabet is represented by 34 letters including which is given its own position. Kurds in Iraq and Iran use this alphabet. Although the Kurdistan Region&#x27;s standardization uses (Unicode 06A9) instead of (Unicode 0643) for letter &quot;kaf&quot; (22 in above table) as listed in the Unicode table on the official home page, the latter glyph is still in use by various individuals and organizations.

=== Vowels ===
Central Kurdish has seven vowels, all of them except are represented by letters:

Similar to some letters in English, both (u) and (î) can become consonants. In the words (Wan) and (play), and are consonants. Central Kurdish stipulates that syllables must be formed with at least one vowel, whilst a maximum of two vowels is permitted.

==Historical alphabets==

===Old Kurdish script===

An old Kurdish alphabet is documented by the Muslim author Ibn Wahshiyya in his book &quot;Shawq al-Mustaham&quot; written in 856 A.D. Ibn Wahshiyya writes: &quot;I saw thirty books in Baghdad in this alphabet, out of which I translated two scientific books from Kurdish into Arabic; one of the books on the culture of the vine and the palm tree, and the other on water and the means of finding it out in unknown ground.&quot; It has also been claimed by “Center for Arab and Middle Eastern Studies” that the Old Kurdish script, like several other scripts found in Ibn Washiyya&#x27;s book, are fantastical inventions.

===Cyrillic alphabet===
A third system, used for the few (Kurmanji-speaking) Kurds in the former Soviet Union, especially in Armenia, used a Cyrillic alphabet, consisting of 40 letters. It was designed in 1946 by Heciyê Cindî.

===Armenian alphabet===
From 1921 to 1929, a modified version of the Armenian alphabet was used for Kurmanji, in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.

It was then replaced with a Yañalif-like Latin alphabet during the campaigns for Latinisation in the Soviet Union.

=== Soviet Latin alphabet ===

In 1928, Kurdish languages in all of the Soviet Union, including the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, were switched to a Latin alphabet containing some Cyrillic characters. 

1929 it was reformed and was replaced by the following alphabet:

The Soviet Latin alphabet is no longer used.


The Yezidi script is written from right to left and was used to write in Kurdish, specifically in the Kurmanji dialect (also called Northern Kurdish). The script has a long history, according to some data, it can be dated back to 13th-14th centuries, however, some scholars trace the creation of this script to 17th-18th centuries. The author of the script is unknown, but it was used for two manuscripts, &quot;Meṣḥefa Reş&quot; and &quot;Kitêba Cilwe&quot;, first published by Anastase Marie in 1911.

It is believed that historically, there existed two sacred Yezidi manuscripts known as &quot;Meshefa Reş&quot; and &quot;Kitêba Cilwe&quot;, but the originals were lost. Later copies of these manuscripts were found, written in a special Yezidi alphabet, however, their contents was distorted. As a result, while the Yazidi clergy do recognize the Yezidi alphabet, they do not consider the content of these two manuscripts to be sources of the Yezidi religion.

In 2013, the Spiritual Council of Yazidis in Georgia decided to revive the Yezidi script and use it for writing prayers, religious books, on the organization letterhead and in the Yazidi heraldry. Today, it is used by the Yazidi clergymen in the Yazidi temple of Sultan Ezid at Tbilisi, where the names of the Yazidi saints are written on walls in this alphabet. Furthermore, &quot;Dua&#x27;yêd Êzdiyan&quot;, a book containing a collection of Yazidi prayers, was written and published in the Yezidi alphabet.

<text>Strike Fighter Squadron 15 (VFA-15) was an aviation unit of the United States Navy, based at Naval Air Station Oceana. The squadron was in service from 1 August 1968 to 31 May 2017, although the squadron had adopted the traditions of the first VA-15, which was established on 10 January 1942. The unit&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Valions&quot; and its call sign was &quot;Pride&quot;.

==History==
Two distinct squadrons have been called the &quot;Valions&quot;. Officially, the US Navy does not recognize a direct lineage with disestablished squadrons if a new squadron is formed with the same designation. Often, the new squadron will assume the nickname, insignia, and traditions of the earlier squadrons. The first VA-15 was established on 10 January 1942 and disestablished on 1 June 1969.

===1960s===
On 1 June 1969 after the first VA-15 was disestablished, the men and equipment were merged with Attack Squadron 67 (VA-67), which had been established on 1 August 1968. On 2 June 1969, the combined squadron was redesignated VA-15 and adopted the insignia and traditions of the &quot;Valions&quot;. In August 1968, the squadron began training under VA-174 in the A-7 Corsair II.

===1970s===

In October–November 1973 while embarked on , the squadron operated in the vicinity of Crete in response to the Yom Kippur War.
In June–July 1976 following the assassination of the American Ambassador to Lebanon, VA-15 embarked on operated in the vicinity of Lebanon in support of the evacuation of non-combatants.

===1980s===
In November 1980, the squadron, embarked on were on station when the American hostages were released from Iran.

In May 1981 USS &quot;Independence&quot; transited the Suez Canal and maintained station in the eastern Mediterranean due to the crisis between Israel and Syria following Israeli raids against Syrian surface-to-air missile sites in Lebanon.

In October–November 1983, VA-15 aircraft flew combat close air support and reconnaissance sorties in support of Operation Urgent Fury, the U.S. invasion of Grenada.

On 4 December 1983, in response to hostile fire against U.S. reconnaissance aircraft from Syrian positions in Lebanon, VA-15 aircraft participated in coordinated strikes against Syrian radar, communications and artillery positions overlooking the Multi-National Peacekeeping Forces. One of the squadron&#x27;s A-7E Corsair IIs, flown by the air wing commander, Commander Edward Andrews, was lost when it was hit by a Syrian surface-to-air missile. Commander Andrews ejected, was rescued and returned to USS &quot;Independence.&quot;

From December 1985 to June 1986 the squadron was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 12, 1st Marine Air Wing for a six-month deployment to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. This deployment was designed to test the enhanced interoperability between Marine and Navy squadrons, with emphasis on close air support for Marine ground operations and the sharing of other techniques used by both communities. The squadron participated in Operation &quot;Team Spirit&quot; in Korea.

In June 1986, the squadron began transition training in the F/A-18 Hornet, and on 1 October 1986, VA-15 was redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron 15 (VFA-15). The squadron accepted their first F/A-18 Hornet in January 1987.

===1990s===
On 28 December 1990, VFA-15 departed for a six-month deployment to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. The squadron flew daily strikes into Iraq and occupied Kuwait until the suspension of hostilities on 28 February. During 1992, VFA-15 transitioned to the F/A-18C Hornet. In 1993, VFA-15 deployed again with CVW-8 on board . They operated in the Adriatic Sea participating in Operation Provide Promise (March - April 1993) and Operation Deny Flight (April - May 1993) over Bosnia. They, then, transited with &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; to the Red Sea to conduct operations in support of Operation Southern Watch. They returned to home port with &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; in September 1993. 

In March 1999, VFA-15 departed for a deployment which would involve two theaters of operation. After crossing the Atlantic in record time aboard &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, squadron aircraft were launched in support of Operation Allied Force 30 August to 20 September 1999. For the next thirteen weeks, VFA-15 flew over 1,100 combat sorties over Kosovo to bring an end to Serbian ethnic cleansing. The battle group then steamed to the Persian Gulf and supported Operation Southern Watch. Upon their return, the squadron made a homeport change to NAS Oceana due to the closure of NAS Cecil Field.

===2000s===

During their 2001 deployment, the squadron took station in the Persian Gulf, patrolling the skies of the southern Iraqi no-fly zone.

Soon after returning through the Strait of Hormuz in early fall 2001 to begin the voyage home, the September 11 attacks unfolded. For the next four weeks VFA-15 took station in the North Indian Ocean and prepared for combat, with flight operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), including combat air patrols over Pakistan. Missions into Afghanistan began on 7 October, and over the next several weeks the squadron flew four to eight-hour missions deep into Afghanistan.

In 2002, VFA-15 deployed on USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; to the Mediterranean. In support of the US invasion of Iraq, from 19 March to 15 April 2003, the squadron delivered over 245,000 pounds of ordnance.

In September 2005 the squadron deployed to the Persian Gulf, returning on 11 March 2006. On 8 September 2008 the squadron deployed again to the Persian Gulf in support of OEF. They returned 18 April 2009.

===2010s===
On 11 May 2011, the squadrons of CVW-8 embarked on &#x27;s maiden deployment, scheduled to conduct operations in the US 5th and 6th Fleet areas of operations. Upon return from deployment, the squadron was awarded the Commander, Naval Air Forces Atlantic Battle &quot;E&quot; Award as the dominant Strike Fighter Squadron on the East Coast.

In February 2016, plans were announced to deactivate VFA-15 in FY 2017. The deactivation ceremony took place on 31 May 2017 and the squadron was deactivated on the same day.

<text>The Orange Ridge, DeLand and Atlantic Railroad was a railroad in Central Florida, United States, linking DeLand with the main line of the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway (now the CSX Sanford Subdivision). It connected with the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West main line from DeLand Landing at DeLand Junction. The line is still operated by CSX as their DeLand Spur.

==History==
Florida state law chapter 3332, approved 1880, incorporated the Orange Ridge, DeLand and Atlantic Railroad Company.

Florida state law chapter 3646, approved February 16, 1885, extended the time limit for completion to January 1, 1888.

The railroad was reincorporated in 1886 as the Deland and St. Johns River Railroad Company and converted to 5-foot gauge to match the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway.

The Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway acquired the line in 1890, which became part of the Plant System in 1899. The Plant System became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad merged with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in 1967 to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, and eventually became part of CSX Transportation in the 1980s.

<text>Montes Jura is a mountain range in the northwest part of the near side of the Moon. The selenographic coordinates of this range are 47.1° N 34.0° W. It has a diameter of 422 km, with mountains rising to approximately 3800m above the level of Sinus Iridum. They were named after the Jura Mountains in eastern France / western Switzerland.

This range of mountains form a visually pleasing semi-circular ring around the Sinus Iridum, a bay along the northwestern edge of Mare Imbrium. The blunt, east-facing cape at the southwestern end of the range is named Promontorium Heraclides, while the east-facing wedge at the northeast end is called Promontorium Laplace. As the terminator advances near this range two to three nights after the first quarter moon, the peaks of this range catch the sunlight at their tops. This produces a string of bright points that have been described as the &#x27;jeweled scimitar&#x27; effect.

Ten to eleven days after new moon the crater rim is already illuminated by the sun when the moon is waxing, while the Sinus Iridum is still in shadow. This creates the illusion of a handle, so that the illuminated crater rim is also called Golden Handle.

The only crater of note in this range is Bianchini, which lies across the north-northwestern portion of the curve. A little farther to the west is Sharp, and to the northeast is the ruined crater Maupertuis.

Peter Grego describes a figurine of &quot;The Moon Maiden&quot;, seeing her facial profile in Promontorium Heraclides, her hair in the hills to the west, and her body in Montes Jura. She appears upside down when viewed in binoculars from the Northern Hemisphere.

==History==
In the distant past this range once formed the outer wall of a crater about 260 km in diameter. The southeast face of this crater was then removed and the interior flooded with basaltic lava. As a result, the side of the range facing the mare ends in the nearly level plains, which the opposite side merges with a region of rough and irregular terrain.

<text>The 1772 Instrument of Government () was the constitution of the Kingdom of Sweden from 1772 to 1809. It was promulgated in the wake of the Revolution of 1772, a self-coup mounted by King Gustav III, and replaced the 1720 Instrument of Government, which had been in force for most of the Age of Liberty (1719-72). Although in theory the 1772 Instrument merely readjusted the balance of power between the Crown and the Riksdag of the Estates (Swedish Parliament), without changing Sweden&#x27;s status as a constitutional monarchy, in practice it is generally seen as instituting an absolute monarchy, especially after its modification in 1789 by the Union and Security Act, which further strengthened royal power at the expense of the Riksdag. It remained in force throughout the Gustavian era, until replaced by the 1809 Instrument of Government as a result of the Coup of 1809.

==Background==

During the Age of Liberty (1719–1772), Sweden was governed as a constitutional monarchy, initially under the Instrument of Government (1719) and later under the near-identical Instrument of Government (1720). Under this system, the king played a relatively minor role in the government, which was instead dominated by the Riksdag of the Estates, with most of the executive functions of government being discharged by the Council of the Realm (). The Age of Liberty is generally remembered as a golden age of political and artistic freedom, but it was also characterised by factional struggles between the so-called &quot;Cap&quot; and &quot;Hat&quot; parties in the Riksdag and by military humiliation in the Hats&#x27; War (1741–1743) and the Pomeranian War (1757–1762). Indeed, some historians argue that by the early 1770s the situation had deteriorated to the extent that Sweden was on the brink of anarchy.

Gustav III was therefore able to attract considerable support for his scheme to overthrow the government and replace the 1720 Instrument of Government with a new constitution. On 19 August 1772 the king rallied the Stockholm garrison and arrested the Council of the Realm, along with several prominent members of the Cap party. Two days later he convened a session of the Riksdag and compelled it to accept a new constitution which he had drawn up, the 1772 Instrument of Government.

==Description==
The Instrument of Government was a somewhat curious mix of different influences. In part it was based on earlier Swedish political traditions, harking back above all to the reign of the revered King Gustav II Adolf; for example, it revived the posts of Lord High Chancellor and Lord High Steward, which had once been among the Great Offices of the Realm but had fallen out of use in the previous century.

On the other hand, large parts of the Instrument were also inspired by recent Enlightenment ideas, in particular Montesquieu&#x27;s notion of the separation of powers. This concept would also be one of the main principles behind the US Constitution, drawn up four years later, and indeed Gustav was an avowed admirer of the nascent United States.

However, while Gustav may have admired republican concepts like the separation of powers in theory, in practice he tended to rule as an enlightened despot, akin to contemporaries such as Joseph II of Austria and Frederick the Great of Prussia, rather than as a constitutional monarch. The phraseology of the Instrument of Government was rather vague, in part due to its having been written in haste in the aftermath of the coup, and although it invoked ideas like the separation of powers, it provided few practical checks upon the king&#x27;s power. Moreover, in 1789 Gustav removed many of the few limits which did exist upon his power by compelling the Riksdag to pass the Union and Security Act, which revised the Instrument of Government in a more nakedly authoritarian direction.

===Details===
Significant provisions of the Instrument of Government included the following:
*The king governed the civil service and Parliaments were assembled only at the king&#x27;s will when the king had to raise taxes and legislate (legislation was regulated in articles 40-43). An offensive war also had to be approved by Parliament (article 48) and also new taxation (articles 45-46). 
*The Privy Council&#x27;s justice department (), functioned as a fairly independent Supreme Court (the king had two votes in this Court&#x27;s judgements, as in all decisions by the council in the Age of Liberty). The Privy Council did not however function so much as a political institution as in the Age of Liberty, and in these matters the king could put it aside and listen to other advisors and councillors as the king also often did.
*The king however, had to listen to the advice of the Privy Council in cases concerning treaties about peace, armistice and alliances with foreign powers and (state) visits to other countries. In these cases the council also could veto the king, if all members of the Council shared this view unanimously.

==Coup of 1809==

After the Swedish defeat in the Finnish War, a coup d&#x27;état was mounted against Gustav&#x27;s son and successor, King Gustav IV Adolf, by disgruntled liberals and army officers. The king was forced to abdicate and sent into exile, and a new constitution was then drawn up, the Instrument of Government (1809), which superseded the 1772 Instrument.

==In Finland after 1809==
In the Grand Duchy of Finland, created in 1809 from the eastern third of Sweden as part of the Russian Empire, the 1772 Instrument of Government had a peculiar status. While the Russian emperors, reigning in Finland as grand dukes, never gave any indication that they considered their autocratic powers limited by any constitution, a theory was developed in Finland that the old Instrument of Government remained in force, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, with Finland&#x27;s position as part of the Empire having the nature of a personal union. This theory was, however, never put forward officially and never accepted in St. Petersburg. It did gain considerable popular currency in Finland, so that Russification measures instituted from the 1890s onwards were commonly decried as an &quot;unconstitutional&quot; assault on the country&#x27;s autonomy. The &quot;Constitutionals&quot; (&quot;perustuslailliset&quot;) were an important political faction in Finland at this time, and their legacy of constitutional legalism has had a significant effect on later Finnish politics.

The matter remained officially uncontested and arguably unresolved for more than a century, but after the abdication of Nicholas II in 1917, the Parliament of Finland, as successor to the old Estates of the Realm, moved to assume sovereign power in Finland, based on the old Swedish provisions in case of a vacancy on the throne. This led to a power struggle with the Provisional Government of Russia, as well as within Finland, culminating, after the October Revolution, in the Finnish declaration of independence.

The Instrument of Government was finally superseded when Finland adopted a new, republican instrument of government in 1919.

<text>Flight into Danger is a 1956 Canadian live television play starring James Doohan, Corinne Conley and Cec Linder. It was written by Arthur Hailey, produced and screened by CBC Television, and broadcast on April 3, 1956, on the &quot;General Motors Theatre&quot; series. It was later adapted into two different feature films, a parody feature film, a novel, and international television versions in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia.

==Plot==
While on a flight from Toronto, Ontario, to Vancouver, British Columbia, the pilots at the controls of a Canadair North Star, a large commercial airliner, fall victim to food poisoning. Approximately half of the passengers have also been incapacitated by eating the same fish served to the pilots. After the stewardess (Corinne Conley) asks for help from the passengers, George Spencer (James Doohan), an ex-Second World War Spitfire fighter pilot, is forced to take over, with the stewardess&#x27;s assistance.

==Cast==
==Production==
Playwright Hailey, a former British pilot in the Second World War, emigrated to Canada in 1947. He began working as a sales promotion manager for a tractor-trailer manufacturer in Toronto. On a flight between Vancouver and Toronto in 1955, he came up with the original idea that spawned &quot;Flight into Danger&quot;. The story of an airliner whose passengers and crew were threatened by an unforeseen event such as food poisoning was written in only nine days and shopped about as a screenplay. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, whose television service was less than four years old, bought the script for $600.

The production acquired the cockpit of a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Canadair North Star and had it shipped by road to RCAF Station Trenton, where the filming took place, including aerial shots. The Malton Airport at Malton, Ontario, present day Toronto Pearson International Airport, was also used for the airport scenes.

==Reception==
When &quot;Flight into Danger&quot; was broadcast live-to-air on April 3, 1956, on the network&#x27;s &quot;General Motors Theatre&quot;, it was seen by two million people and received a resounding positive reaction. &quot;In the words of one journalist, it was &#x27;probably the most successful TV play ever written anywhere&#x27;.&quot; A kinescope of the live production was broadcast in August 1956 due to viewer demand. The play was remade with a new cast and production staff on NBC&#x27;s anthology series &quot;The Alcoa Hour&quot; on September 16, 1956, and later the same month the original CBC version was shown by the BBC in the United Kingdom and was a major factor in the supervising producer of CBC&#x27;s television dramas, Sydney Newman, being brought across to work in the UK. There he made a significant impact on the British television drama industry.

In 1957, &quot;Flight into Danger&quot; was adapted into the feature film &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; and, in 1962, the story was adapted for an episode of the BBC series &quot;Studio 4&quot;. In 1964, a German version of the television film was produced under the title &quot;Flug in Gefahr&quot;. Czechoslovak radio (Československý rozhlas) has produced it as part of the radio series &quot;Let do nebezpečí&quot;, directed by Jiří Horčička. An Australian television version was produced in 1966.

In &quot;Flight into Danger&quot;, Hailey created the template for future disaster films. Character-driven plot lines built up among diverse characters would dominate, with brief episodes or flashbacks giving back stories, and all the individual stories coming together at the climax. Hailey&#x27;s story was adapted as a novel by John Castle (a pseudonym for Ronald Payne and John Garrod), with Hailey receiving credit as co-author. The book was called &quot;Flight into Danger&quot; (Souvenir Press) for its British publication in 1958, but retitled &quot;Runway Zero-Eight&quot; (Doubleday) for its American publication in 1959. The story was again produced for American television in 1971 as &quot;Terror in the Sky&quot;, a Movie of the Week, and more famously parodied in the 1980 comedy feature film &quot;Airplane!&quot;.
