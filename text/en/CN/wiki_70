<text>The Quasiturbine or Qurbine engine is a proposed pistonless rotary engine using a rhomboidal rotor whose sides are hinged at the vertices. The volume enclosed between the sides of the rotor and the rotor casing provide compression and expansion in a fashion similar to the more familiar Wankel engine, but the hinging at the edges allows the volume ratio to increase, as detailed in QT-Wankel Two Concepts 100 Years Apart. A geometrical indetermination (not uniquely defined) of the Quasiturbine confinement stator shape allows for a variety of profiles (including asymetrical) and design characteristics. 
Unlike vane pumps, in which vane extension is generally important and against which the pressure acts to generate the rotation, the Quasiturbine contour seals have a minimal extension and the rotation does not result from pressure against these seals.

Since the rotational force within the Quasiturbine comes from the pressure on the entire pivoting-blade, and not on an extensible vanes which impose a geometric back flow at chamber overlaps, the high eccentricity QT stators increases considerably the stroke displacement volumes which can exceed the whole engine volume per rotation. Such a high displacement to external engine volume ratio near unity leads to exceptional engine power density in volume and weight, while maintaining high torque. Patents for the Quasiturbine (in the most general AC concept with carriages) are held by the family of Gilles Saint-Hilaire of Québec. As well as an internal combustion engine, the Quasiturbine has been proposed as a possible pump design, and a possible Stirling engine. It has been demonstrated as a pneumatic engine using stored compressed air, and as a steam engine.

There are at least four proposed designs:
* Two-port with carriages, suitable for use as an internal combustion engine.
* Four-port without carriages, suitable for use as a pneumatic engine or hydraulic engine, steam engine or pump.
* Two-port without carriages, a conceptual design which is hoped to combine some of the advantages of the existing two- and four-port prototypes.
* Another conceptual design using a fixed charge of gas, with no ports and without carriages, as a Stirling engine. (But not yet referring Malone engine in spite of similar function to Stirling engine)

==Two-port with carriages==
The earliest Quasiturbine design used a three-wheeled &quot;carriage&quot; (French &quot;chariot&quot;, hence &quot;avec chariots&quot; or &quot;AC&quot; for &quot;with carriages&quot;) to support each vertex of the rotor. The wheels of these four carriages, making twelve wheels in total, ran around the periphery of the engine chamber.

A prototype of an internal combustion engine to this design was constructed, and enthusiastically reviewed in European Automotive Design magazine September, 1999. The prototype was turned by an external engine for 40 hours.

However, ignition with fuel was never achieved. If it was attempted no results were ever released, and development work on this design was no priority, in spite of Quasiturbine internal combustion test.

===Photo-detonation===
The two-port design with carriages was proposed to make possible a new and superior mode of combustion, termed photo-detonation by the Quasiturbine inventors. This resembles detonation, as used in the Bourke engine, akin to knocking and pinging undesirable in common internal combustion engines. , no research has been published supporting this claim. A related idea that flame transfer would be possible through special ports is similarly unsupported.

==Four-port without carriages==
The second Quasiturbine design is greatly simplified to eliminate the carriages (French &quot;sans chariots&quot; or &quot;SC&quot;). At the same time, the ports were duplicated on the opposite side of the housing, thus converting the operation from four strokes per cycle to two and doubling the number of cycles per rotor revolution. This mechanism has been demonstrated running as a pneumatic engine using stored compressed air, and also as a steam engine as reported in Scholar Papers. This is also the design proposed for use as a pump, and particularly as a supercharger.

This design uses redesigned blades, longer than those for a similar sized housing of the first type owing to the absence of the carriages, and lacking the distinctive crown contour. Only the basic rotor geometry is common with the earlier design.

A pneumatic engine of this design was demonstrated powering a go-kart in November 2004, and another powering a small car in September 2005, both vehicles using stored compressed air to power the engine. a pneumatic chain saw driven by an air hose from a conventional external compressor is under development.

With a suitably redesigned housing to allow for thermal expansion, the same rotor design has been demonstrated as a steam engine.

Another potential variation of this design uses the two sets of ports independently, one as an engine and the other as a pump, thus potentially integrating the functions of a pump and its driving motor in one shaftless unit. One restriction of this usage is that the two fluids must be similar; It would not be possible for example to drive an integrated air pump with hydraulic fluid, as the rotor design is significantly different. no prototype of this variation has been demonstrated.

The Otto mode Quasiturbine uses a spark ignition, while the photo-detonation Quasiturbine eliminates the need for spark plugs and an electrical ignition system. In photo-detonation mode, the fuel/air charge auto-ignites with a short, powerful pressure pulse in the Quasiturbine&#x27;s combustion chamber.

==Two-port without carriages==
This third design combines aspects of the first two. this design is conceptual only. It has not been built, but is used for purposes of illustration. If built it would not support photo-detonation.

Many other designs are possible within the patented Quasiturbine model, with or without carriages and with differing numbers of ports. , which design will be used for further work on the internal combustion version has not been announced.

== History ==
Prof. J. Ignacio Martínez-Artajo (1907-1984) from Universidad Pontificia Comillas (Madrid, Spain) made sketches of an adaptative rotary compressor in the mid seventies, which led to the construction of a railway model missing of proper rotor dynamic solutions. Lately, research was conducted by Dr. Gilles Saint-Hilaire, a thermonuclear physicist, and members of his immediate family. The original objective was to make a turbo-shaft turbine engine where the compressor portion and the power portion would be in the same plane. In order to achieve this they had to disconnect the blades from the main shaft, chain them around in such a way that a single rotor acts as a compressor for a quarter turn and as an engine for the following quarter of a turn.

The general concept of the Quasiturbine engine was first patented in 1996. Small pneumatic and steam units are available from the patent holders for sale or hire for research, academic training and industrial demonstration, as is a book (largely in French) describing the concepts and development of the design. Demonstrations have been undertaken on an Air Gokart in 2004, on “APUQ Air Car” in 2005, on the University of Connecticut “Brash Steam Car” in 2010, and other products (Chainsaw and generator).

The patent holders have announced that they intend to make similar internal combustion prototypes available for demonstration.

<text>Sutter Health Park is a ballpark in West Sacramento, California. It is the home of the Sacramento River Cats of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the temporary home of the Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). Known as Raley Field from 2000 to 2019, the facility was built on the site of old warehouses and rail yards, across the Sacramento River from the California State Capitol. It is directly adjacent to downtown Sacramento.

==History==
The $46.5 million stadium was built in eight and a half months, but extended periods of bad weather forced the River Cats on a season-opening one-month-long road trip, as completion was delayed by 45 days. The completion time, however, was estimated to be about two years. The home opener was played on May 15, 2000.

The stadium is one of the few professional sports facilities in the nation built without a public sector contribution. Although constructed using bonds financed by the River City Stadium Financing Authority, bond payments are paid from ticket, concession, advertising, and other revenues, not taxes. Because the $46.5 million project cost was too large for the host city to finance, Christopher Cabaldon, in his first term as mayor of West Sacramento, recruited Sacramento County and Yolo County to join his city in a joint-powers agency which became the stadium financing authority. 

The stadium has 10,624 permanent seats and grass berms in both right and left fields for a total capacity of 14,014. Its original capacity was 14,611 and was decreased to 14,414 in 2005 with the addition of a party deck. It further decreased in 2010 with the opening of the Diamond Club behind home plate. The stadium has 2,798 club seats and 750 seats in 36 suites.

The initial naming rights for the facility were sold to Raley&#x27;s, a regional chain of supermarkets which is also based in West Sacramento, for $15 million over 20 years.

The ballpark hosted the 2005 Triple-A All-Star Game in which the Pacific Coast League All-Stars defeated the International League All-Stars, 11–5.

There was discussion of the Sacramento Mountain Lions, an American football team in the United Football League, using the field during the 2012 season. A final agreement to this effect was announced on August 6, 2012. The UFL, including the Mountain Lions, abruptly shut down operations in the middle of the 2012 season.

On July 18, 2013, Raley Field hosted a soccer match, a friendly featuring Mexican side Dorados de Sinaloa and Premier League side Norwich City F.C. The game finished 3–0 to Norwich, with goals from Luciano Becchio, Anthony Pilkington and Josh Murphy. The match&#x27;s attendance was 14,014.

As part of the Golden State Hockey Rush, Raley Field hosted a minor league hockey game between the Stockton Heat and the Bakersfield Condors of the American Hockey League on December 18, 2015.

The ballpark was renamed Sutter Health Park after the 2019 season as part of a naming rights agreement with Sacramento-based Sutter Health.

===Temporary home of the Athletics===

On April 4, 2024, it was announced that the Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB) will play at Sutter Health Park from 2025 through 2027, with an option for a fourth year pending the team&#x27;s move to Las Vegas.

On April 4, 2024, the Sacramento River Cats announced that, tentatively, they will remain at Sutter Health Park as well, and they will play on days the Athletics are not playing there.

On March 31, 2025, the Athletics will play their first home game at the stadium against the Chicago Cubs.

<text>Dame Felicity Joan Palmer, (born 6 April 1944), is an English mezzo-soprano and music professor. She sang soprano roles until 1983.

Palmer was born in Cheltenham and educated at Erith Grammar School, now named Erith School. She studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London and under Marianne Schech&#x27;s guidance at the Munich College for Music and Theatre. In April 1970, she won first prize in the Kathleen Ferrier Memorial Scholarship. She made her operatic debut in 1971 as Dido in &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; with the Kent Opera. In 1973, she made her US debut with the Houston Grand Opera and her Metropolitan Opera debut was in 2000 as Waltraute (&quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;). Having made her debut with English National Opera (ENO) in 1975, her performance with the company forty years later, as the Countess in The Queen of Spades, was widely applauded and described as &#x27;mesmerising&#x27; and &#x27;astonishing&#x27;.

Palmer has performed and recorded Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as Katisha in &quot;The Mikado&quot; for the ENO and the Welsh National Opera (WNO), Dame Carruthers in &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; (WNO) and Little Buttercup in &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; (WNO). In 1998, she played Widow Begbick in the Lyric Opera of Chicago production of &quot;The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny&quot;. In 2003, she performed the role of Mrs Lovett in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; at the Royal Opera House (the only musical the ROH has ever presented). She sang Venus in a 1983 BBC television broadcast of &quot;Orphée aux Enfers&quot; conducted by Alexander Faris.

Palmer is noted for her interpretation of the role of Madame de Croissy in Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot;, which she has sung at the Metropolitan Opera and at the Lyric Opera of Chicago&#x27;s first ever production of the work. She also sang the role in English with the ENO and recorded it as part of the Chandos &quot;Opera in English&quot; series. Her other commercial recordings include &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; and &#x27;Love&#x27;s Old Sweet Song, Victorian and Edwardian Ballads&#x27;, 1978, The Decca Recording Company:1997,L.P.;Belart,C.D.,(a Polygram Company),0 28946 14902 7:( John Constable on piano).

Her work in contemporary music has included the first Glyndebourne production of Péter Eötvös&#x27;s opera &quot;Love and Other Demons&quot;, in the role of Josefa Miranda.

Palmer is a professor at the Royal College of Music in London. She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1993 and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to music.

She is a first cousin of Barclay Palmer, Olympic athlete and humanities educator and reformer.

<text>Erik Acharius (10 October 1757 – 14 August 1819) was a Swedish botanist who pioneered the taxonomy of lichens and is known as the &quot;father of lichenology&quot;. Acharius was famously the last pupil of Carl Linnaeus.

== Life ==
Acharius was born in 1757 to Johan Eric Acharius and Catharina Margaretha Hagtorn in Gävle. He received a private education until he was admitted to Gävle Gymnasium in 1770. Later he matriculated at Uppsala University in 1773 where he studied natural history and medicine under Linnaeus and was the last student to defend a dissertation before him. Acharius&#x27;s dissertation titled, &quot;Planta Aphyteia&quot;, was on a vascular plant species (&quot;Hydnora&quot;) collected in Southern Africa by Carl Peter Thunberg, which Linnaeus incorrectly classified as fungi. Thus he is known as &quot;Carl Linnaeus last disciple&quot; or the last pupil of Linnaeus. After graduating from Uppsala in 1776, he later worked for the Royal Academy of Sciences in Stockholm and completed his medical studies at Lund University in 1782. He was appointed town medical officer in Vadstena in 1785, district medical officer in Östergötland County in 1789, director of the new Vadstena Hospital (which he had initiated) in 1795, and titular professor in 1803. As a cartoonist, Acharius Johan illustrated Peter Westring&#x27;s work &quot;Svenska lafvarne&quot; color history (1805) and Carl Peter Thunberg&#x27;s &quot;Flora Capensis&quot;.

In 1787 Erik Acharius married Helena Dorotea Scholander (1762–1804), the daughter of a trader, in Landskrona. After Helena&#x27;s death Acharius married Margareta Maria Hoffberg on 31 December 1804. She was the daughter of Gottfrid Hoffberg who was in charge of production of saltpeter for munitions in Skänninge. In total Erik Acharius had four children, Lars Gustaf Acharius, Jean Torkel Acharius, Catharina Theodora Ohrling (née Acharius) and Charlotta Wilhelmina Acharius.

Acharius spent the remainder of his life in Vadstena, where he died of a stroke while in his household garden examining a Spanish collection of lichens on 14 August 1819, at the age of 61.

== Work in lichenology ==
Acharius belonged to the younger generations of Swedish botanists who continued what Linnaeus had left undone; classifying all living organisms. Acharius began the taxonomic classification of &quot;Lichenes&quot; and during his lifetime he classified over 3300 species of lichen separated into 40 different genera. At the time of Linnaeus&#x27;s death all lichens were grouped into a single genus, thus Acharius was the first to expand lichen classification into the multi-divisional group of organisms it is known to be today. His first publication was &quot;Lichenographiae Suecia prodromus,&quot; published in 1798, which detailed all known lichen species found in Sweden. This was the first published work to detail lichens using binomial nomenclature and expand their classification beyond a single genus. While composing &quot;Lichenographiae Suecia prodromus&quot;, Acharius began communicating with Olof Swartz, another Linnaean disciple, and from 1780 to 1815 they sent nearly 350 letters to each other. Swartz is believed by many historians to have heavily influenced the development of Acharius&#x27;s classification system. Additionally, Swartz introduced Acharius to many other Swedish naturalists as also several important international figures such as James Edward Smith, the head of the Linnean Society. This exposure aided Acharius in spreading his new findings on lichens to an international audience. After publishing his first work, he sent a copy to James Edward Smith who, in response, inducted Acharius as a foreign member of the Linnean Society. Subsequently, Acharius published &quot;Methodus qua omnes detectos Lichenes&quot; (1803), &quot;Lichenographia universalis&quot; (1810), and &quot;Synopsis methodica lichenum&quot; (1814) each of which he sent to the Society in London, accompanied by hundreds of the specimens described in each book. Over his lifetime Acharius collected over 5500 specimens of lichen most of which are housed today in the Botanical Museum of the Finnish Museum of Natural History.

In his influential works, Acharius introduced many lichen-related terminology that remain in common use today. Starting with designating the pits on the underside of &quot;Sticta&quot; lichens as in 1794, he added the terms , , , , , and in 1803; in 1810; and in 1817.

== Legacy ==
Acharius&#x27;s international reputation influence many new lichenologist from all over Europe. In 1804 Friedrich Weber (1781–1823) and Daniel Matthias Heinrich Mohr (1780–1808), two German naturalists, published &quot;Naturhistorische Reise durch einen Theil Schwedens&quot; which heavily featured his work on lichens and also included four illustrations by Acharius. Furthermore, William Borrer who pioneered lichenology in Britain (and is often called the father of British lichenology) was heavily influence by Acharius&#x27;s specimens and publications received by the Linnean society in London. These collections and books were studied by Borrer in 1809 and served as the basis for his own work. Additionally Thomas Gage published &quot;A Monograph of the Genus Cenomyce: Consisting of Coloured Drawings of Each Species and Variety, As Described in the Lichenographia Universalis of Acharius&quot; in 1815, which contained illustrations of every species and variation of the genus &quot;Cenomyce&quot; as described in &quot;Lichenographia universalis&quot;. To this day several of Acharius&#x27;s original classification schema are still used in lichen taxonomy. The International Association for Lichenology has named its medal for lifetime achievement in lichenology the Acharius Medal after him. and also in 1992 installed a commemorative plaque on the house in Vadstena where he lived for many years.

== Publications and honors ==

He was a member of the Royal Physiographic Society in Lund (1795), the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1796), the Linnean Society of London (1801), appointed Knight of the Order of Vasa (1809), and the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala (1810).

The plant genus &quot;Acharia&quot; (in 1794,), several plants species (e.g., &quot;Rosa acharii&quot;, and (type of lichen), &quot;Conferva acharii&quot;) and one insect, &quot;Tortrix achariana&quot; have all been named after Acharius.

The collections of Acharius are distributed over several museums: the Finnish Museum of Natural History in Helsinki, which holds the Botanical Museum in Uppsala, the Swedish Museum of Natural History and the Botanical Museum in Lund. His papers are in the Library of Uppsala University. There are also specimens that he collected in the Natural History Museum, London. 

The following is a list of Erik Acharius&#x27;s publications:

&quot;Lichenographiae svecicae Prodromus&quot; (Beginning of a Lichenography of Sweden) 1798

<text>Fahud is a permanent oil camp and oil field in the middle of the central plain area of Oman, named after the nearby Jebel Fahud believed to mean &quot;Leopard Mountain&quot; from the time when wild leopards roamed the area. The main oil camp is owned by Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), the national oil company. 

Oil operations commenced in 1954 when a PDO survey party arrived at the jebel and began surveying it. The first well at Jebel Fahud was completed at 12,235 feet in May 1957. Unfortunately, it was a dry hole except for a very small quantity of gas and oil.
Three of the PDO partners decided to withdraw from the Omani concession, leaving Shell (85%) and Partex (15%) to take it over and resume exploration. Only a few hundred yards from the original test well site, a second test well was sunk at Fahud and, in 1964, found oil in commercial quantities. 

Today, Fahud is the central base of PDO&#x27;s operations in the interior of Oman; the company&#x27;s main offices are in Mina Al Fahal in Muscat. Many contracting companies also have camps for their workers and equipment at Fahud. 
The town is served by Fahud Airport.

<doc id="1253897" wikidata="Q134469" url="?curid=1253897" title="Banyamulenge">
<text>The Banyamulenge are a community that lives mainly in South Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Banyamulenge are not culturally and socially distinct from the Tutsi of South Kivu, with most speaking &quot;Kinyamulenge&quot;, a mix of Kinyarwanda (official language of Rwanda), Kirundi (spoken primarily in Burundi), Ha (spoken by the Ha people, one of the largest ethnic groups in ethnically diverse Tanzania), and Swahili. 

The Banyamulenge played a role in Mobutu&#x27;s war against and victory over the Simba Rebellion, which was not supported by the majority of other tribes in South Kivu. They supported him to be naturalised in what was then Zaire. Their role during the First Congo War and subsequent regional conflicts (Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma, Movement for the Liberation of the Congo, National Congress for the Defence of the People, and more importantly for the fact that two of the most influential presidents of their country declared them as enemies of the state, in both 1996 (Mobutu Sese Seko) and 1998 (Laurent-Désiré Kabila).

The Banyamulenge have been a point of controversy in the country since they played a key role in tensions against the Simba Rebellion (1963–1965), First Congo War (1996–1997), Second Congo War (1998–2003), and Joseph Kabila&#x27;s regime (2001–2019). The wars in the DRC have affected more than 10 million lives most of which are congolese who are not bayamulenge, with casualties continuing in Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, and Tanganyika provinces.

In the late 1990s, the political scientist René Lemarchand stated that the main ethnic groups claimed that the Banyamulenge numbered around 50,000 to 70,000. Gérard Prunier quotes around 60,000–80,000, a figure of about 3% to 4% of the total provincial population. Lemarchand states the figure of 400,000 given by Joseph Mutambo &quot;is grossly inflated&quot;. Lemarchand also noted that the group represents &quot;a rather unique case of ethnogenesis&quot;.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Mulenge&quot; is a term historically referring to mountains concentrated on the High Plateau of South Kivu, in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to the Burundi-Congo-Rwanda border. The term translates literally as &quot;people of Mulenge&quot;, a &quot;groupement&quot; on the Itombwe plateau. The name was chosen in the early 1970s to avoid being called &quot;Banyarwanda&quot; and being seen as foreigners in what was then Zaire. In 1976, the word &quot;Banyamulenge&quot; first came into wide usage after Gisaro Muhazo, a South Kivutian deputy, began an initiative to reclassify the Banyamulenge of Mwenga, Fizi and Uvira into a single administrative entity. Muhazo&#x27;s attempt failed, but the term that he introduced remained. Over the decades, it became used as a catchall label for the Rwandans living in the eastern parts.

== Origins and early political status ==
While the RPF claims that Banyamulenge were brought in the 18th century from Rwanda, Burundi and the Karagwa area of Tanzania, records and historical data show Banyamulenge came to the area in the 19th century and were used by the Belgian king.

Rwandan historians give two reasons for the migration. One is that Tutsis tried to avoid the increasingly high taxes imposed by &quot;Mwami&quot; Rwabugiri of the Kingdom of Rwanda. That, however, is grossly false as there are no known conflicts to have existed to the point of migration into the Congo. Also, Tutsis fled the violent war of succession that erupted in 1895, after the death of Rwabugiri. The group was mostly Tutsi and their Hutu &quot;abagaragu&quot; (clients), who had been &quot;icyihuture&quot; (turned Tutsi), which negated interethnic tensions. They settled above the Ruzizi Plain, on the Itombwe Plateau. The plateau, which reached an altitude of 3000 meters, could not support large-scale agriculture, but allowed cattle grazing. That version is grossly disputed because various tribes had been in conflict over where the newcomers would stay to herd their sheeps. They were thus given the Mulenge Mountain to herd. 

Banyarwanda migrants continued to arrive, particularly as labourers, during the colonial period. The Union Minière du Haut Katanga recruited more than 7000 workers from 1925 to 1929. From the 1930s, Congolese Banyarwanda immigrants continued coming in search of work, with a major influx of Tutsi refugees in 1959–1960, afterthe &quot;Social Revolution&quot;, led by the Hutu Grégoire Kayibanda. While the early migrants lived primarily as pastoralists in the high plains, colonial labour migrants moved to urban areas. Refugees were placed in refugee camps. In 1924, the pastoralists received permission from colonial authorities to occupy a high plateau further south.

The groups received further immigrants during the overthrow of the Tutsi monarchy and the colonial clashes between 1959 and 1973. Many Banyamulenge initially joined the Simba Rebellion of 1964 and 1965 but switched sides when the rebels, fleeing both Jean Schramme&#x27;s mercenaries and government troops, came onto the plateau and began to end the rebellion. The Tutsi rose, accepted weapons from the pro-Mobutu forces and assisted in defeating the remaining rebels. Because many of the rebels who were killed were from the neighbouring Bembe people, the existing tensions were worsened. The Bembe felt that the Bayamulenge were overstaying their welcome and discriminating against their neighbours, who had allowed them to graze their cattle. Also, they had been brought predominantly by colonials and forced onto their lands. The government rewarded the Banyamulenge&#x27;s efforts by appointing individuals to high positions in the capital Bukavu, and their children were increasingly sent to missionary schools. Lemarchand asserts: &quot;From a primarily rural, isolated, backward community, the Banyamulenge would soon become
increasingly aware of themselves as a political force&quot;.

After the war, the group took advantage of a favourable political environment to expand their territory. Some moved south towards Moba Port and Kalemi, and others moved onto the Ruzizi Plain, where a few became chiefs among the Barundi through gifts of cattle. Still others went to work in the Bukavu, the provincial capital, or Uvira, a town experiencing a gold rush economic boom. The urban dwellers could make a fair living selling meat and milk from their herds to the gold diggers though the group lacked the political connections to Kinshasa or a large educated class, which was possessed by the North Kivu Banyarwanda.

The pastoralists were located within three &quot;territoires&quot;: Mwenga, inhabited by the Lega people; Fizi of the Bembe people, the Babwari people and the Banyindu people; and Uvira, inhabited by the Vira people, Bafuliro and Barundi. Ethnic tensions against the Tutsi rose after the end of the colonial period, as well as during the mass killings in 1972 of Hutu in Burundi. In response, the Tutsi appear to have attempted to distance themselves from their ethnicity as Rwandans and lay claim to a territorial identity as residents of Mulenge. As they moved, they continued that practice. Some Tutsi Banyarwanda in South Kivu call themselves the Banya-tulambo and Banya-minembwe, after the places in which they were located.

== Political tensions (1971–1992) ==
After 1971, such practices became increasingly controversial. The 1971 Citizenship Decree by President Mobutu Sese Seko granted citizenship to the Banyarwanda who had arrived as refugees from 1959 to 1963. However, some leaders, such as Chief of Staff Barthélémy Bisengimana, were concerned that the change was an alarming sign of the growing influence of the Banyarwanda in the administration.

In reaction to the apparently growing influence of the Banyamulenge, the majority ethnicities, particularly the Nande and Hunde of North Kivu, focused on dominating the 1977 legislative elections. Once that had been accomplished, they passed the 1981 Citizenship Bill, stating that only people who could prove descent from someone resident in Congo in 1885 would qualify for citizenship. From the perspective of the so-called &quot;indigenous ethnicities&quot;, such as the Babembe, Bafuliro, the name &quot;Banyamulenge&quot; was a claim to indigeneity in Mulenge.

However, the bill proved difficult to implement by the time of the 1985 provincial assembly elections and so the so-called &quot;indigenous Kivutian majority&quot; came up with an &quot;ad hoc&quot; measure: Banyarwanda (including Banyamulenge and Tutsi from North Kivu) were allowed to vote in elections but not to run for political office. That appeared to aggravate the situation, as the Banyarwanda who qualified as citizens under the 1981 law still found their political rights curtailed. Some so-called Banyarwanda, particularly Banyamulenge, smashed ballot boxes in protest. Others formed Umoja, an organization of all Congolese Banyarwanda. However, in 1988, the increasing tensions in the Banyarwanda community of North Kivu led to the division of the organization into Tutsi and Hutu groups in North Kivu since the Hutus controlled Rwanda.

The 1991 (CNS) was a sign of the increasing coherence of the anti-Mobutu forces, and came as the Congolese Banyarwanda were in a state of heightened tension. After the beginning of the Rwandan Civil War in 1990, many young Tutsi men in Kivu crossed the border to join the Tutsi-dominated rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in its fight against the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government. In response, the Mobutu government implemented Mission d&#x27;Identification de Zaïrois au Kivu to identify non-Zairean Banyarwanda by using the 1885 end of the Berlin Conference as the cutoff. Many Banyarwanda whose families had come as colonial labourers were classified as aliens, which resuulted in yet more youth joining the RPF. The overall effect of the CNS was to strengthen the tendency of &quot;indigenous&quot; Congolese to differentiate Tutsis from Hutus and thus lump together all Tutsi Banyarwanda as &quot;Banyamulenge&quot;. It also underlined the fragility of their political position to the Banyamulenge. Within the Banyarwanda in the Kivus, the Hutu began defining themselves as &quot;indigenous&quot; compared to the Tutsis, who were increasingly seen as owing their allegiance to the foreign groups.

== Conflict (1993–1998) ==
In 1993, the issue of land and indigenous claims in the Kivus erupted into bloody conflict. Hutu and some Tutsi landlords began buying the lands of poor Hutu and Bahunde of the Wanyanga chiefdom in Masisi, North Kivu. After they had been displaced, 1000 people went to Walikale to demand the right to elect their own ethnic leaders. The Banyanga, insisting that only &quot;indigenous people&quot; could claim that customary right, began fighting the Hutu.

The 1000 people returned to Masisi, where the Hutu landlords and Banyarwanda in general supported the claim of Banyarwanda to &quot;indigenous&quot; rights. The government sent in the Division Spéciale Présidentielle (DSP) and the Guarde Civile to restore order. Ill-supplied, the security forces were forced to live off the local population: the DSP off the rich Hutu and the Guarde Civile off the Bahunde and ordinary Hutus. The DSP appeared to be protecting the rights of the &quot;non-indigenous&quot; (primarily Hutus) against the &quot;indigenous&quot; (primarily Bahunde), sparking outrage and increasing the scope of the conflict. One estimate is that between 10,000 and 20,000 people were killed; another 200,000 people were forced to flee their homes.

In late 1993, about 50,000 Burundian refugees from the Burundi Civil War began streaming into primarily South Kivu. They were followed the next year by almost one million mostly Hutu refugees from the Rwandan genocide, which created the Great Lakes refugee crisis. The Hutu government that was responsible for the genocide came with the refugees and turned the camps into armed bases from which they could launch attacks against the newly-victorious RPF government in Rwanda. The influx of refugees dramatically changed the situation of the Banyamulenge.

The Congolese Tutsis in North Kivu were threatened by the new armed Hutu camps, and the newly-established Tutsi government in Rwanda gave them a safe place to go. Their peril was underlined by a commission led by , who declared that all Banyarwanda were refugees and must return to Rwanda. In April 1995, Anzuluni Mbembe, the co-speaker of the Parliament of Congo, signed a resolution stating that all Banyamulenge were recent refugees (regardless of how long they had lived in the Congo) and providing a list of Banyamulenge who would be expelled from the country. Between March and May 1996, the remaining Tutsi in Masisi and Rutshuru were identified and expelled into refugee camps in Gisenyi. The Bahunde, forced out by the Hutu, also took refuge there.

The situation in South Kivu took longer to develop. Since the 1994 refugees arrived, local authorities began appropriating Banyamulenge-owned property in the valley with the support of Mbembe. Threatened by both the armed Hutus to the north and the Congolese Army appropriating property and land, the Banyamulenge of South Kivu sought cross-border training and supply of arms from the RPF. As threats proliferated, each Native Authority formed its own militia. Finally, in November 1996, the RPF-backed Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL), which the Banyamulenge militias joined, crossed the border and dismantled the camps, before it continued to Kinshasa and overthrew Mobutu. The ranks of the AFDL were composed in large part by the Banyamulenge, who filled most of the administrative positions in South Kivu after the fall of Bukavu.

As documented in the DRC Mapping Exercise Report by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the success of the invasion led to revenge killings by the Tutsi Banyarwanda against their opponents. Perhaps 6000 Hutu were purged in the week after the AFDL had captured the town. It was worse in South Kivu, as Banyamulenge settled local scores and RPF soldiers appeared to conflate the &quot;génocidaires&quot; with the Hutu with the &quot;indigenous&quot; Congolese. One intellectual in Bukavu who was otherwise sympathetic to the Banyamulenge claim to citizenship stated:
The Banyamulenge conquered their rights by arms but the rift between them and the local population has grown. The attitude of the Tutsi soldiers—during and after the war has made them more detested by the population due to the killings, torture. For example, they will go into the village, raid all the cattle, tell the population—since when have you learned to keep cattle; we are cattle; we know cattle. In Bukavu, they went into and stole from houses. Not so much in Goma. The result is the population is increasingly getting concerned over the question of the Tutsi presence.

== Second Congo War (1998–2003) ==

The situation became more polarised with the beginning of the Second Congo War in 1998. Those who had carried out the massacres of Hutus became part of the ruling military forces in the Kivus. Meanwhile, the Congolese government of Laurent Kabila urged the &quot;indigenous&quot; population to fight not only the invading Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) but also the Congolese Tutsi civilians, most of those affected being Banyamulenge. Matching actions to words, Kabila armed &quot;indigenous&quot; militias Mai-Mai and Congolese Hutu militias, as well as the génocidaires (those who carried out mass killings during and after the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which nearly a million Rwandans, primarily Tutsis, were killed by their Hutu neighbours) in response to the RPF&#x27;s supplying arms to the Banyamulenge. The two Mai-Mai groups that were the most active against the Banyamulenge were the Babembe and the Balega militias.

The various Banyamulenge militias and the Rwandan government forces separated because of disagreements over motives of the uprising after the creation of RCD-Goma. In early 2002, extensive fighting took place on the high plateau of South Kivu after Commandant Patrick Masunzu, then a Tutsi officer in the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma) rebel movement, gathered Banyamulenge support in an uprising against the RCD-Goma leadership.

By 2000, the Banyamulenge were hemmed into the high plateau by Congolese Mai-Mai, the Burundian Forces for the Defense of Democracy and the Rwandan Hutu Armée de Libération du Rwanda (ALiR). They were unable to carry out basic economic activities without the security provided through the RCD-Goma. Numerous families fled to the relative safety of the Burundian capital, Bujumbura. Nevertheless, the Banyamulenge made up much of the RCD military wing, the Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC), and controlled the towns of Fizi, Uvira and Minembwe, which had been recently declared a &quot;commune&quot; among many others in 2018.

In August 2004, 166 Banyamulenge refugees were massacred at a refugee camp in Gatumba, Burundi, by a force that was mostly National Forces of Liberation rebels. Vice-President Azarias Ruberwa, a Munyamulenge, suspended his participation in the transitional government for one week in protest before he was persuaded to return to Kinshasa by pressure from South Africa.

== M23 War and present (2012–2019) ==

Many Banyamulenge were opposed to the M23 Rebel Movement. Most Banyamulenge opposed Rwandan support of the rebellious M23 led by Tutsi from the North Kivu province although many Banyamulenge living in Rwanda as refugees or Rwandan citizens benefited from the government of Rwanda. Some of them even occupy government posts and others can be found in lucrative private sectors, and others seek residence as refugees and benefit from the US government resettlement program to relocate to the United States, which has a flourishing Banyamulenge diaspora. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Banyamulenge have been part of the elite community in politics and the military and benefit from Kabila himself even though they were hated by some members of his inner circle. That has led to increased tensions with local communities all over the country, which argue that the groups receives undeserved preferential treatment from the government. That view is largely held by other tribes in South Kivu, which have always maintained that the Banyamulenge are more Rwandan than they are Congolese.

It remains a question of interest as to how they will be treated by the Félix Tshisekedi regime since they have, in one way or the other, been fairly treated and protected under Kabila&#x27;s leadership. The Congolese identify themselves based on their territories. For example, the Bembe and the Lega tribes identify themselves based on the following territories including Itombwe, Lulenge, Ngandja, Tanganyika and M&#x27;tambala. In each territory, the land occupants are well-known regardless of their residence. Though part of Sud Kivu is inhabited, its dwellers know their territories well and the land that belongs to each tribe. In recent years, tensions over the identity of the Banyamulenge and their claims to a newly established district/&quot;commune&quot; (Minembwe) have created a new cycle of regional political and military disagreements, which have led to new ethnic clashes and have involved foreign armed groups.

In late 2019, rising ethnic tensions in South Kivu caused several high-ranking national political and military leaders to journey to Minembwe as an attempt to appease ethnic tensions in the region. In the diaspora, especially in North America and the European Union, a movement protesting violence towards Banyamulenge was created by using social media. International broadcasting channels reported on several demonstrations in the United States and Canada. Despite all of the violence, Banyamulenge have resorted to peaceful strategies to resolve these problems. On 6 January, the community endorsed a judicial inquiry/mission to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for crimes committed against the Banyamulenge in Minembwe.

In 2020, the World Youth Alliance warned that the Banyamulenge people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo &quot;are facing another wave of inhumane emotional and psychological terror and being subjected to genocidal acts of violence. A coalition of local militias has been carrying out killings of Banyamulenge people who have been in a dire humanitarian situation in the central African region for years. In addition, popular politicians, both in the provinces and the capital city Kinshasa have started campaigns whose main goal is to demonize Tutsis, the Banyamulenge community in particular, by denying their inalienable right to Congolese autochthony and scapegoating them for the woes that the country has been through since the 1990s.&quot;

<text>Edward Goodrich Acheson (March 9, 1856 – July 6, 1931) was an American chemist. Born in Washington, Pennsylvania, he was the inventor of the Acheson process, which is still used to make silicon carbide (carborundum). Acheson founded the Carborundum Company in 1891 and became a manufacturer of carborundum and synthetic graphite.

==Biography==

Acheson (1856–1931) was raised in the coal fields of southwestern Pennsylvania.
Acheson attended the Bellefonte Academy for three years, 1870–72; this being the totality of his formal education.
 He left school at the age of 16 to help support his family after his father died, and worked as a surveying assistant for the Pittsburgh Southern Railroad.

He devoted his evenings to scientific pursuits—primarily electrical experiments. In 1880, he had the temerity to attempt to sell a battery of his own invention to Thomas Edison and wound up being hired. Edison put him to work on September 12, 1880, at his Menlo Park, New Jersey laboratory under John Kruesi. Acheson experimented on making a conducting carbon that Edison could use in his electric light bulbs.

In 1881, he was sent to the International Exposition of Electricity in Paris, as part of the team led by Charles Batchelor, and he remained in Europe in 1882 to install demonstrations of the Edison system of electrical lighting in Antwerp City Hall in Belgium and in La Scala in Milan, among other public places.

In 1884, Acheson left Edison and became supervisor at a plant competing to manufacture electric lamps. He began working on the development of methods to produce artificial diamond in an electric furnace. After heating a mixture of clay and coke in an iron bowl with a carbon arc light he found shiny, hexagonal crystals (silicon carbide) attached to the carbon electrode. He called it carborundum.

In 1891, Acheson built an electricity plant in Port Huron, Michigan, at the suggestion of Edison and used the electricity to experiment with carborundum. That year he founded the Carborundum Company, utilizing a dynamo of 135 hp.

The first commercial plant using the Acheson process was built by Acheson in Niagara Falls, New York, where hydroelectric plants nearby could cheaply produce the necessary power for the energy intensive process. Its dynamo produced 1000 hp. By 1896, The Carborundum Company was manufacturing 1 million pounds of carborundum.

Acheson was forced out of his own company in 1901. By 1910 its dynamos were generating 10,000 hp of electricity and producing ten million pounds of silicon carbide per year. Twenty years later it was “supplying the world with enough silicon carbide to influence the entire metallurgical, stone, abrasive paper, leather, jewelry, rice, and high temperature electrical heating element industries.” 

Acheson had received a patent on his method of producing Carborundum on February 28, 1893, although a 1900 decision gave &quot;priority broadly&quot; to the Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company &quot;for reducing ores and other substances by the incandescent method&quot;.
Acheson received 70 patents relating to abrasives, graphite products, reduction of oxides, and refractories. He was awarded the first Acheson Award, named in his honour, by the Electrochemical Society in 1931. 

He died on July 6, 1931, in New York City.

===Recognition===
In 1953, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker outside his home, noting the historic importance of his achievements. In 1997, Acheson was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. His house, the Edward G. Acheson House in Monongahela, Pennsylvania is a National Historic Landmark.

As one of The Electrochemical Society&#x27;s most prestigious members, the organization presents an award in his name every two years to distinguish contributions to the advancement of any of the objects, purposes, or activities of the Society.

<doc id="1253907" wikidata="Q7815794" url="?curid=1253907" title="Tom Fitzgerald (soccer)">
<text>Tom Fitzgerald (March 14, 1951 – December 4, 2004) was an American soccer coach.

==Career==
Fitzgerald played soccer at Hudson Valley Community College before transferring to the University of South Florida his junior season. He played soccer at USF and he graduated in 1974. In 1978, Jesuit High School in Tampa, Florida hired Fitzgerald as the school&#x27;s head coach. From 1978 to 1981, he led the team to two district championships and a 35–11–6 record.

He was hired by the University of Tampa as an assistant coach in 1981 and became the team&#x27;s head coach in 1987. He led the team to five Sunshine State Conference championships and the 1994 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division II Soccer Championship over Oakland University. During Fitzgerald&#x27;s nine years as head coach, he compiled a 132–32–11 (75% winning percentage) record.

In 1996, the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer hired Fitzgerald as an assistant coach. When the Crew head coach Timo Liekoski resigned after a 6–16 start to the season, the team promoted Fitzgerald to head coach. He led the team to a 9–1 record over the last ten games of the season. In 1998, he took the Crew to the U.S. Open Cup where they lost to the Chicago Fire. When he was fired six games into the 2001 season, Fitzgerald had posted a 70–67–7 record.

In March 2002, Fitzgerald returned to the college ranks, this time with the Division I UCLA Bruins. In his first season at UCLA, Fitzgerald led the team to an NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Soccer Championship. He became the first NCAA Division I coach to win a title in his first year with a program. He was also just the third coach to win both Division I and II NCAA titles. He was named the 2002 NSCAA/adidas National Coach of the Year.

In 2004, Fitzgerald left UCLA to rejoin the University of Tampa where he began the season 6–9–1. Tom&#x27;s main motivation for moving back to Tampa was to be closer to his family. On December 4, 2004, Fitzgerald was driving his motorcycle to scout players at a youth soccer festival in Bradenton, Florida when he was struck by an SUV. Fitzgerald initially seemed to be alright, calling his wife after the accident. He was taken to Tampa General Hospital, but hemorrhaging occurred and Fitzgerald died during surgery to repair his torn aorta. A memorial stone for Fitzgerald was unveiled at Columbus Crew Stadium on April 2, 2005.

<text>Dame Kathleen Lonsdale ( Yardley; 28 January 1903 – 1 April 1971) was an Irish crystallographer, pacifist, and prison reform activist. She proved, in 1929, that the benzene ring is flat by using X-ray diffraction methods to elucidate the structure of hexamethylbenzene. She was the first to use Fourier spectral methods while solving the structure of hexachlorobenzene in 1931. During her career she attained several firsts for female scientists, including being one of the first two women elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1945 (along with Marjory Stephenson), first female professor at University College London, first woman president of the International Union of Crystallography, and first woman president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

==Early life and education==
She was born Kathleen Yardley in Newbridge, County Kildare, Ireland. She was born to English born Harry Yardley, the town postmaster, and Jessie Cameron a Baptist of Scottish descent. 

She was the youngest of ten children, four of whom died in infancy. During her time living in Newbridge she attended St. Patrick&#x27;s National School, and her earliest memories were of the local Church of Ireland service and the Methodist Sunday school. 

Kathleen&#x27;s father had issues with alcohol, which meant her family was often short on money. As the unrest in Ireland became more severe Kathleen&#x27;s mother separated from her father and took the rest of the family to England. 

Her family moved to Seven Kings, Essex, England, when she was five years old. The family&#x27;s financial troubles meant the four older children left school early to support the family. For the same reason, her brother Fred was unable to take up an educational scholarship, though he later become one of the first wireless operators.

Kathleen attended Downshall Elementary school from 1908 to 1914. She studied at Ilford County High School for Girls, then transferred to Ilford County High School for Boys to study mathematics and science, because the girls&#x27; school did not offer these subjects. Kathleen had the highest score in physics that any student at London University ever had. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree from Bedford College for Women in 1922, and Master of Science (MSc) degree in physics from University College London in 1924.

==Career and research==
In 1924 she joined the crystallography research team headed by William Henry Bragg at the Royal Institution. Following her marriage in 1927, she moved to the University of Leeds, but continued to correspond with Bragg. From 1929 to 1934, she started a family and largely stayed at home while continuing her work calculating structure factors. Her husband Thomas Lonsdale was a textile chemist who supported his wife&#x27;s research. He encouraged his wife to work from home and to go back to work when offered. He worked at Silk Research Association in Leeds after they were married.

In 1934, Lonsdale returned to work with Bragg at the Royal Institution as a researcher. She was awarded a DSc from University of London in 1936 while at the Royal Institution. In addition to discovering the structure of benzene and hexachlorobenzene, Lonsdale worked on the synthesis of diamonds. She was a pioneer in the use of X-rays to study crystals. Lonsdale was one of the first two women elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1945 (the other was the biochemist Marjory Stephenson).

Lonsdale returned to University College London (UCL) in 1946 with the rank of reader. In 1949, she was appointed Professor of Chemistry and head of the Department of Crystallography at UCL. She was the first woman to be made a professor at UCL, an appointment she held until 1968 when she was named professor emeritus.

As a keen table tennis player, Lonsdale made use of ping pong balls to demonstrate the molecular structure to her students. One such model—of the silicate group —is in the Science Museum collection 

During her later career, she became interested in stones and minerals produced in the human body e.g. kidney stones or gall stones. Some of her crystallographic models are in the collection of the Science Museum in London.

==Personal life==

After beginning her research career, in 1927 Yardley married Thomas Jackson Lonsdale. They had three children – Jane, Nancy, and Stephen. Stephen became a medical doctor and worked for several years in Nyasaland (now Malawi).

Lonsdale was a vegetarian and teetotaller.

===Pacifism===
Though she had been brought up in the Baptist denomination as a child, Kathleen Lonsdale became a Quaker in 1935, simultaneously with her husband. Already committed pacifists, both were attracted to Quakerism for this reason. She was a Sponsor of the Peace Pledge Union.

She served a month in Holloway prison during the Second World War because she refused to register for civil defence duties, or to pay a fine for refusing to register. During this time she experienced a range of issues which would eventually result in Lonsdale becoming a prison reform activist and she joined the Howard League for Penal Reform. &quot;What I was not prepared for was the general insanity of an administrative system in which lip service is paid to the idea of segregation and the ideal of reform, when in practice the opportunities for contamination and infection are innumerable, and those responsible for re-education practically nil&quot; In 1953, at the Yearly Meeting of the British Quakers, she delivered the keynote Swarthmore Lecture, under the title &quot;Removing the Causes of War&quot;. A self-identified Christian pacifist, she wrote about peaceful dialogue and was appointed the first secretary of Churches&#x27; Council of Healing by the Archbishop of Canterbury William Temple.

===Death===
Lonsdale died on 1 April 1971, aged 68, from cancer.

<text>Hugh Gardner Ackley (June 30, 1915 – February 12, 1998) was an American economist and diplomat.

Ackley served as a member of the Council of Economic Advisers under President John F. Kennedy, and as the chairman under President Lyndon B. Johnson from 1964 to 1968. He also served as ambassador to Italy from 1968 to 1969. Ackley was a member of the University of Michigan faculty for 43 years and served as chair of its economics department. Upon returning to the university following his ambassadorship, he was named the Henry Carter Adams Professor of Political Economy. In 1982 he served as president of the American Economic Association.

Ackley was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1915, and was raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where he attended public schools and graduated from Western Michigan University in 1936. He earned a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1940, and joined the faculty that year. He served in the U.S. Office of Price Administration and the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, D.C., from 1941 to 1946 and as assistant director of the U.S. Office of Price Stabilization from 1951 to 1952.

Ackley believed that government had a definite role in fine tuning the economy, using both fiscal and monetary intervention. He warned President Johnson in 1966 that a tax increase was needed to finance the escalation of the war in Vietnam and the increased social welfare spending that Johnson was undertaking. Johnson did not ask for a tax increase, and economists, including Paul Samuelson, believed this was the cause of the inflation of the 1970s.

Ackley was the author of the popular graduate-level textbook &quot;Macroeconomic Theory&quot;, which was translated into several languages and remained the standard advanced text during the 1960s and early 1970s. He was awarded a fellowship from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1968 and another fellowship from the Ford Foundation. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1972.

Ackley has a dormitory hall at Western Michigan University named after him.

<text>Lansbury Park is a residential suburb of the town of Caerphilly in Wales.

The estate was built as council housing (by housebuilders and civil contractors the John Laing Group) in the 1960s on former farmland. The first two housing courts were officially opened by Ness Edwards, the local MP, in 1965. It is in the eastern part of Caerphilly and is overshadowed, though at some distance, by the concentric castle of Caerphilly Castle, the second biggest of its type in Europe.

A Morrisons supermarket and petrol station with a convenience store are nearby. Public transport is infrequent.

The estate was named after George Lansbury the politician. He was Leader of the Labour Party from 1932 to 1935. He was the grandfather of Angela Lansbury, the star of Murder She Wrote and other TV dramas. There is a Lansbury Estate in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets named after George Lansbury as well.

The people on the estate live in poverty which has been described as &quot;entrenched&quot;. Many people on the estate do not have secure employment, or are in low-paid work. In 2014, the estate was identified in the Multiple deprivation index as the most deprived area in Wales. In 2019, its ranking fell slightly to make it the third most deprived area in Wales.

<doc id="1253924" wikidata="Q6146818" url="?curid=1253924" title="Osamu Tezuka's Star System">
<text>is the name given to the recurring characters in manga created by manga artist Osamu Tezuka. Throughout his career, Tezuka frequently re-used the same character designs or names in different roles across his series; for example, the character Shunsaku Ban appears as a detective in &quot;Metropolis&quot; and as Astro Boy&#x27;s teacher in &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. The name alludes to the Hollywood practice of the star system, and can be seen as analogous to film directors who work with the same actors across multiple films; Tezuka joked about how much his characters were paid, and occasionally based them on famous western actors.

== Primary characters ==
=== Akira Asagumo ===

Akira Asagumo is the grandson of the scientist Dr. Asagumo. He gets his super human powers from the chemical called &quot;Big X&quot;, which gives him the ability that makes him grow and expand without limits. He appeared in &quot;Shōnen Bool&quot; from 1963 to 1966.

=== Astro Boy ===

 is a principal &quot;actor&quot;. He is shown in the famous manga and assorted versions of the anime as a child robot, usually wearing shorts (which are actually part of his body), identified by his trademark, two pointy &quot;cowlicks&quot; on the front and back of his head. In the manga, his good nature and incorruptible heart, combined with an array of powers, put him on a quest to protect robots and humans from villainous conquerors and alien invaders. He made other appearances in other manga including Black Jack&#x27;s, in which he plays a major role in at least one story (volume 22 of the English manga release by Dark Horse of &quot;Astro Boy&quot;) and in the anime &quot;Undersea Super Train: Marine Express&quot;, in which he is called &quot;Adam&quot;. Astro resembles the wooden boy Pinocchio.

=== Black Jack ===

 is a cold-natured, eerie, yet kindhearted and ingenious surgeon is one of Tezuka&#x27;s dearest creations, despite the fact that in the present day he receives little credit compared to his rival Astro Boy. Black Jack is, according to Tezuka, his alter ego. Black Jack refuses to get a medical license, due to the corruption within medicine practices, and may run into the legal forces while doing operations (in the 2006 TV anime Black Jack finally gets his license). Despite his outlaw status, he is considered a miracle worker with his incomparable surgical technique and power of diagnostic analysis. His operations are generally over 10 million yen, but he more frequently helps the unfortunate for free or a token payment. He is sometimes accompanied by his short-tempered adopted daughter/assistant, Pinoko and can be recognized by a large cape, loose trench coat, and blue, black or red string tie (depending on the media) with black and white hair, dark eyes, and a graft of dark skin across the upper left of his face. Having learned wit playing with darts as a boy, is a skilled marksman as well as well-trained in martial arts. A statue of Black Jack stands in the Osamu Tezuka Museum beneath a skylight.

=== Bokko, Pukko and Nokko ===

Bokko, Pukko and Nokko are a trio of three intergalactic patrollers known as the Amazing 3. They came to Earth to research and destroy it if necessary. They appeared in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from May 1965 to May 1966.

=== Don Dracula ===
 is a comical vampire who moved from Transylvania to Japan and has a hard time adjusting to the new place. In the animated film &quot;Marine Express&quot; and the video game &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot;, Don Dracula is a villain who works for Sharaku.

=== Garon ===
 is a giant robot sent by aliens as a test for Earth&#x27;s inhabitants. His original comic, &quot;Majin Garon&quot;, ran in &quot;Boukenoh&quot; () from July 1959 until July 1962. He is the final boss of the video game &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot; and the secret treasure of Mu.

=== Ham Egg ===
, also known as Cachatore, Hammond Eggs, Hamegg, or Simon Sakely (in &quot;Jungle Emperor Leo&quot;) is a villain with a round head, a thin moustache, a wide grin, curly hair and sometimes a top hat. His name is an obvious play on the words &quot;ham and eggs&quot;.

He is primarily known for being a cruel circus manager in &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. He was also a hotel manager and an organ smuggler in &quot;Phoenix&quot;. He made other appearances in &quot;Astro Boy&quot; (such as a gangster or a murderous surgeon). In &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;, he portrays the hunter who kills Kimba&#x27;s father, Panja, and holds him captive during his infancy.

=== Higeoyaji ===

, or Shunsuke Ban, is a bald, portly, middle-aged man with a large chalk-white moustache. He is an often comical and grumpy yet good-natured. He is 42 years old, as mentioned in one of the manga. His facial hair earns him the nickname . In the 1960s English version of the animated Astro Boy, his name was private detective Edgar Pompous, then Percival Pompous. Perhaps because his character was appearing in another animated series based on Tezuka&#x27;s manga at the time, in the 1980s English animated Astro Boy changed his name to Albert Duncan, and he was given the nickname &quot;Daddy Walrus&quot;. His typical role is that of a detective in other Tezuka materials, with sometimes a nephew/assistant named Ken&#x27;ichi (&quot;Ken&quot; or &quot;Kennedy&quot; in English versions of the &quot;Astro Boy&quot; TV series). The 1980s color remake (as well as the original manga) had him appear as Astro Boy&#x27;s teacher, then as a detective. In the 2003 Astro Boy series, he is called Wally Kisaragi, and in the English-language manga, his &quot;Higeoyaji&quot; nickname is translated as &quot;Mustachio&quot;. He is featured as either a regular character or a guest star in any of a number of Tezuka works. Shunsaku Ban is often cast as some sort of adventurer, usually an amateur or professional private investigator. His trademark characteristic is to confront danger with a comical wild-eyed panic, then after a moment recapture his composure and vigorously attack the threat.

=== Hosuke Sharaku ===

 is a baby-faced young boy with a large head, often sporting a bandage. His main role was in &quot;The Three-Eyed One&quot; where he is a three-eyed child with evil powers. He has featured in &quot;Astro Boy&quot;-related media, appearing as the main antagonist in the game &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot; and as a supporting character in the PlayStation 2 game &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. He was Assaji the apprentice monk in &quot;Buddha&quot;, still with his bandage. He appeared in the &quot;Black Jack&quot; anime, also with his bandage. Sharaku&#x27;s third eye is hidden by the bandage, which suppresses both his power and evil nature.

=== Kenichi ===
Kenichi (ケン一) is one of Tezuka&#x27;s oldest and most often cast &quot;actors&quot;. Kenichi&#x27;s character design is borrowed from Dick Huemer&#x27;s Scrappy, initially confused as &quot;Happie&quot;. He is also known as Kenichi Shikishima, which is a name derived from his role in &quot;Lost World&quot;. Fans gave him this name to help distinguish him, although it is not officially recognized by Tezuka Productions. The Japanese writing of his name, &quot;ケン一&quot; is unique as it is a pun on the number one in Japanese (ichi) written as &quot;一&quot; in kanji, so it is like saying &quot;Kenichi number one&quot;. Alternate spellings include &quot;Ken1&quot;, &quot;ケン1&quot;, and in English he is known as Kennedy or simply Ken. He is often paired with Higeoyaji, who usually takes the role of his uncle.

Kenichi can be recognized by his soft round face with one or several curls poking out of his hair, also known as a cowlick or . He sometimes has simple dotted cartoon eyes reminiscent of Tintin, but later on he is drawn with more detailed irises. He is also often seen wearing shoes that are half white in the back and dark in the front, but this could be a way of stylizing spats.

Kenichi would often take the role of the main hero in Tezuka&#x27;s early works, but Tezuka would later revoke his role as the protagonist because he &quot;lacked individuality&quot;. The manga world was becoming more focused on more complex characters, and Kenichi embodied the one-dimensional, wholesome, &quot;good boy&quot; status of early childhood, but not much else. Eventually, readers lost interest in him. After he was retired as a main protagonist, he would usually take a supporting role in other stories, such as Astro Boy&#x27;s classmate and Leo&#x27;s friend in &quot;Jungle Emperor&quot;.

In 1954 Tezuka created a manga that was focused on Kenichi as the hero, because he still liked the character very much. In &quot;Chief Detective Kenichi&quot; (ケン1探偵長), the plot follows Kenichi, who is a young detective solving various crimes with his pet bird Donguri. This would be one of his last roles as the main hero.

* Part of the Osamu Tezuka Star System with other Tezuka characters is listed and described in the &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot; game, as the &quot;Omega Factor&quot;: it is a memory data which raises Astro Boy&#x27;s power as it levels up. To increase it, Astro has to make full acquaintance of characters throughout the game. This also unlocks biographies of the characters.

<doc id="1253934" wikidata="Q3162953" url="?curid=1253934" title="Joseph Franklin Ada">
<text>Joseph Franklin Ada (born December 3, 1943) is an Guamanian politician who served as the fifth governor of Guam from 1987 to 1995. Before his accession to the governorship, Ada previously served as the third Lieutenant Governor of Guam from 1979 to 1983. He is a member of the Republican Party of Guam. He is the member of the Guam Legislature as the lead speaker from 1975 to 1979 and member as the senator from 1975 to 1979 and again from 1983 to 1987.

==Early life==
Ada was born in Tamuning, Guam, to José &quot;Ping&quot; Torres Ada (1915–1984) and Regina San Nicolas Herrero (1921–2009). He attended the College of Guam for two years before entering the University of Portland, where he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in corporate finance in 1968. Ada&#x27;s late grandfather Josef Martinez Ada who owned Ada&#x27;s Soap Factory in Anigua from the early 1930s until his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1955.

Ada is married to Rosanne Jacqueline Santos and has three children, Eric Ada, Tricia Yoo, and Ester Dela Paz, and has five grandchildren. His wife died on March 18, 2021.

==Political career before the Ada-Blas Administration==
===Guam Legislature===
Ada&#x27;s public career began under Governor Carlos G. Camacho, who appointed him deputy director of the Department of Public Works in 1970. Ada, who had just turned 27 at the time, remained as Public Works deputy director until 1972, when he resigned to make his first bid for elected office. He won a seat in the 12th Guam Legislature as a member of the Republican minority at the age of 28. In the election for the 13th Guam Legislature, the Republicans were swept into the majority and Ada was the overall top vote getter. His colleagues chose him to be Speaker of the 13th Guam Legislature at the age of 31. Ada was a top vote getter again in the 14th Guam Legislature and was again chosen as Speaker.

Ada never forgot what Camacho did for him by offering Ada that first leadership position. He followed Camacho&#x27;s example after he became governor, offering cabinet positions to bright young people, many who became leaders in their own right.

During his term as speaker, Ada, a strong advocate of education, established priorities that would remain important to him in the years to come. He cosponsored a bill that created the Guam Community College and made a substantial investment in vocational education. As Speaker, he also pushed for additional funding for recreation and sports programs especially for Guam&#x27;s youth.

Ada led the fight to prevent massive personnel lay offs at Guam&#x27;s Ship Repair Facility (SRF) in the mid-1970s. He traveled to Washington, D.C., and presented Guam&#x27;s case to forestall the closure of SRF, saving hundreds of local jobs. Twenty years later the shipyard was privatized but the jobs were still there.

===Lieutenant governor===
In the election of 1978 Ada was asked by Sen. Paul Calvo to join him as his running mate for the Republican nomination as Governor and Lieutenant Governor of Guam. The two won the election and Ada, now 35, became the Lt. Governor of Guam. Believing strongly that the future of the region depended on unspoiled ocean resources and fisheries, Ada led the fight to stop both the United States and Japan from dumping nuclear and chemical wastes into the Pacific Ocean. He presented the Pacific case in Washington and in Tokyo and helped stop the plan for ocean dumping of nuclear waste.

Ada declined to run for a second term with Calvo in 1982 and chose instead to return to the legislature. Topping the polls again, he was elected to the 17th and 18th Guam Legislatures in 1982 and 1984. The Republicans, however, were in the minority during these terms and it was difficult to make progress. Ada then decided to run for governor.

===Ada-Blas Campaign (1986)===
 His running mate and lieutenant governor was former senator Frank Blas. Ada served numerous terms in the Guam Legislature, becoming the first Republican speaker of the legislature when the Republicans captured control of the body from the Democratic Party. Ada was elected Lt. Governor of Guam with running mate Paul McDonald Calvo in 1978, but declined the opportunity to serve as Calvo&#x27;s running mate for re-election in 1982 and instead returned to the legislature. Calvo lost the subsequent election to Ricky Bordallo. Ada is the only Guam political leader to serve as Speaker, lieutenant governor and governor. He stewarded Guam&#x27;s economic expansion and pushed, successfully, for return of land held by the US military.

==Governorship==
===First term===
When Ada began his first term Guam was in the throes of an economic recession with the government suffering under a crushing deficit. Ada put all his administration&#x27;s efforts toward Guam&#x27;s economic recovery, and eventually he presided over one of the fastest growing and strongest economies in the island&#x27;s history due in part to a growth in tourism from a booming Japanese economy. He launched an austerity program at the start of his term and followed it with a program to encourage investment and trade from Asia. He eliminated the government deficit in three years. Despite a decrease in federal spending, Guam&#x27;s economy doubled and some 25,000 new jobs were created. A majority of these jobs were in Guam&#x27;s growing private sector. During Ada&#x27;s first term, private sector employment outstripped public sector employment in Guam&#x27;s economy for the first time in the modern era.

As chairperson of the Commission on Self-Determination, established in 1980 to lead the way toward determining a new political status for Guam, Ada presided over the completion of the Guam Commonwealth Act and presented to the people of Guam for approval in a plebiscite. Upon the Act&#x27;s approval, Ada took it to US Congress. A strong advocate for self-government and self-determination for Guam, he called for an end to Guam&#x27;s colonial status and pushed for the liberation of Guam&#x27;s economy from federal regulations. Congress, however, did not act on the Guam Commonwealth Act and Guam&#x27;s political status remains unresolved.
Ada believed that Guam needed to be financially healthy and not dependent on the US government in order to move forward politically. He said the federal government has tied Guam&#x27;s hands more than once pointing to postwar security clearance, federal land takings for US bases and the Jones Act which puts Guam at a financial disadvantage for shipping.

To address those concerns Ada said he supported the newly developed qualifying certificate program at the Guam Economic Development Authority to bring in foreign investment, pushed for good fuel rates and port lease fees to bring tuna transshipment to Guam, and worked on getting a visa waiver for visitors to Guam from Korea and Taiwan, all of which helped move Guam away from being dependent on US federal dollars. He also directed floating the first bond for infrastructure rather than ask for more federal funds.

===Ada-Blas Campaign (1990)===
He was the first governor of Guam to be reelected to a consecutive term in office, after winning reelection in 1990, but the Democrats were defeated in the general election by the Bordallo-Duenas team on November 6, 1990, with their Senators Madeleine Bordallo and Ping Duenas upon the current governor Ada.

===Second term===
In his second term Ada capitalized on the fruits of his economic recovery program and made the largest investment in education in Guam up to that time. He directed the floating of a bond which made some $170 million available for the construction of a new high school in southern Guam (now Guam Southern High School), new elementary schools in Tamuning, Inarajan and Dededo, and reconstruction of schools in Upi and Ordot-Chalan Pago. Additionally many new classrooms were built to relieve overcrowding in schools around the island. Operating budgets for the public schools were increased annually. Under Ada computers and computer classes were introduced in all Guam schools. At the end of his term every grade level in every school had access to computer classes.

Guam suffered from a string of natural disasters during the second Ada administration. Four sequential typhoons affected the area in 1991, with Typhoon Omar causing the most damage. The 7.8 Mw Guam earthquake occurred on August 8, 1993, with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (&quot;Violent&quot;). Damage ran into millions of dollars though only two buildings were destroyed. These disasters, combined with a recession in Japan, caused the tourism industry to suffer for a time.

==Public life after the Ada-Blas Administration==
===Ada-Camacho Campaign (1998)===
When his second term was over, he once again ran for governor in 1998, with then Sen. Felix Camacho as his running mate then-Senator Felix Perez Camacho, but was defeated by incumbent Democratic governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez and his running mate Madeleine Bordallo for a contentious race ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2000, Ada ran for senator once more and was elected, joining the Republican majority in the legislature. In 2002, he ran for Congressional delegate against Democrat Madeleine Bordallo, but lost.

===UOG Vice-Chairman===
He recently serves as the vice-chairman of the board of the University of Guam Endowment Foundation. Founded by Jesus S. Leon Guerrero, the foundation is dedicated to promoting the university through academic enhancements, scholarship opportunities, and development of creative fundraising opportunities for overall improvements to the campus.

<text>Adam von Bodenstein (1528–1577) was a Swiss Paracelsian alchemist and physician. He was born in Kemberg near Wittenberg in Germany and died of the plague in Basel. His father, Andreas Rudolph Bodenstein von Karlstadt, was a prominent theologian and early Protestant opponent of Martin Luther.

As the guiding force of early German Paracelsianism, Bodenstein published over forty Paracelsian titles from 1560, which had a tremendous influence on the later development of Paracelsianism. Since he published these texts without the knowledge of the Basel medical faculty, he was expelled from &quot;Facultet und Consilio“ of the Basel University. Bodenstein also became, with Gerhard Dorn, Johannes Oporinus, and Michael Toxites, the most influential translator of the works of Paracelsus.

<text>James Adam (21 July 1732 – 20 October 1794) was a Scottish architect and furniture designer, but was often overshadowed by his older brother and business partner, Robert Adam. They were sons of architect William Adam.

== Life and career ==
Adam was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife in 1732 as the third son of the architect William Adam.

In 1755 Adam worked on Gunsgreen House in the Berwickshire town of Eyemouth.

In 1758, Adam, along with his brother Robert, started his business in London (living in Lower Grosvenor Street), focusing on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, but Robert had evolved a new, more flexible signature style incorporating elements of classic Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles, often termed as Adam Style in conventional architecture texts. The Adam brothers&#x27; success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their designs.

He then followed in Robert&#x27;s footsteps by undertaking the &quot;Grand Tour&quot;, leaving in May 1760 and arriving back in London in October 1763.

Adam succeeded Robert as Architect of the King&#x27;s Works in 1768 just before work on the brothers&#x27; Adelphi project (1768–1772) almost bankrupted the firm (the business employed other notable architects including Joseph Bonomi (1739–1808) who, from 1768, remained with the Adams until 1781).

From 1771 to 1775, he was engaged with his brother in the design and building of Wedderburn Castle near Duns, Berwickshire.

Adam emerged from his brother&#x27;s shadow after Robert&#x27;s death in 1792, designing several notable buildings in Glasgow, including the old Infirmary (1792; demolished 1907), Assembly Rooms (1794; demolished in 1890) and the Tron Kirk (1794). He also designed Portland Place in central London. In 1793, he was part of a group of architects that John Soane was asked to supply plans to for the House of Lords. However, he died at his home in London&#x27;s Albemarle Street in 1794.

Adam had a book collection of some significance which he marked with his personal engraved bookplate.

During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, &quot;Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam&quot; (in 1773–1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).

<doc id="1253944" wikidata="Q5200106" url="?curid=1253944" title="Cynthia Longfield">
<text>Cynthia Evelyn Longfield (16 August 1896 – 27 June 1991) was an Anglo-Irish entomologist and explorer and the first woman member of the Entomological Society. She was an expert on the dragonfly and was nicknamed &quot;Madame Dragonfly&quot;. She travelled extensively and published &quot;The Dragonflies of the British Isles&quot; in 1937. She worked as a research associate at the Natural History Museum, London, and was the expert on the dragonflies there, particularly on African species.

== Early life ==
Cynthia Evelyn Longfield was born on 16 August 1896, on Pont Street, Belgravia, London. She was the youngest daughter of Alice Elizabeth (née Mason) and Montifort Longfield, of Castle Mary, Cloyne, County Cork. She had two sisters. Her mother Alice Longfield grew up near Oxford, and was the daughter of a scientist. Alice died in 1945. The family home at Castle Mary was burned down in 1920 by rebels, and Park House was rebuilt on the grounds.

== Career ==
Longfield joined the Army Service Corps during the First World War, later moving to an aircraft factory on Fullham Road. She visited South America between December 1921 and March 1922. She travelled to the Andes and Lake Titicaca. In 1923 she travelled to Egypt, where she caught a scorpion at the tomb of Ramases IX. 

In the same year Longfield answered an advertisement to join Evelyn Cheesman of London Zoo on a research trip to the Pacific, specifically the Galapagos Islands. They sailed aboard the St George, which left Dartmouth on 9 April 1924. She collected coleoptera (beetles) and lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) as an assistant to an entomologist, Cyril Collenette. The pair used machetes to hack through the undergrowth of the Amazon jungle to collect specimens for the Natural History Museum in London. 

She joined the Entomological Society of London in 1925, and later the same year joined the Royal Geographical Society. She was the first woman member of the Entomological Society. In 1926 she joined the London Natural History Society. She was elected president of the society for 1932 and 1933. 

Longfield was a voluntary cataloguer at the Natural History Museum and was put in charge of work on dragonflies. She joined a six-month expedition to Matto Grosso, Brazil in 1927, and returned with samples of 38 of species of dragonfly. Three of these species were previously unidentified. The species &quot;Corphaeschna longfieldae&quot; is named in her honour. By 1937, Longfield had become an international authority on the subject of dragonflies and published a book entitled &quot;The Dragonflies of the British Isles&quot;. The book quickly sold out, and earned her the name &quot;Madame Dragonfly&quot;. 

On 28 March 1938 she joined the Auxiliary Fire Service, and during the Second World War ensured that a turntable ladder was used in response to the bombing of the biology department of the Natural History Museum in April 1941. Cyril Collenette stated that her actions in relation to this likely saved the Museum from destruction. She was appointed an honorary associate of the Natural History Museum in 1948.

In 1979 she donated dragonfly and damselfly specimens to the Royal Irish Academy, as well as her written records and more than 500 natural history books. In 1983 she was elected the first Honorary Member of the British Dragonfly Society.

== Later life and death ==
Before her retirement from the Natural History Museum, Longfield purchased an apartment in Kensington, London, where she resided until her eventual retirement at age 60. In 1957, she returned to Castle Mary, the family estate, in Cloyne, County Cork where she lived until her death. She died aged 96 on 27 June 1991 and was buried in St. Coleman&#x27;s Church of Ireland Cathedral, close to her home in Cloyne.

== Legacy and commemoration ==
The Longfield Roberts Collection, a photograph album belonging to Longfield and taken and developed during the St George Expedition to the South Sea Islands in 1924 to 1925, is held by the Royal Irish Academy. The c.800 photographs mainly depict the people and life on the ship and the flora and fauna of the Pacific Islands.

An exhibition entitled The Longfield exhibition was opened in the Royal Irish Academy on Dawson Street in 2006.

Longfield&#x27;s life and career was celebrated by an event held on the centenary of the St George expedition.

<doc id="1253945" wikidata="Q980151" url="?curid=1253945" title="Jan Peerce">
<text>Jan Peerce (born Yehoshua Pinkhes Perelmuth; June 3, 1904 December 15, 1984) was an American operatic tenor. Peerce was an accomplished performer on the operatic and Broadway concert stages, in solo recitals, and as a recording artist. He is the father of film director Larry Peerce.

==Family life==
Jan Peerce was born Jacob Pincus Perelmuth (though his Hebrew gravestone gives his first name as יהושע, or Joshua, not Jacob), to a Jewish family. His parents, Levi (anglicized to Louis) and Henya Perelmuth, came from the village of Horodetz, formerly in Poland, now Belarus. Their first child, a daughter, died in an epidemic. In 1903 they emigrated to America along with their second child, a boy named Mottel. A year later, on June 3, 1904, their third child, Jacob Pincus, was born in a cold water flat in the Lower East Side, Manhattan, New York. He was nicknamed &quot;Pinky&quot; by his neighborhood friends. When he was three years old, his older brother Mottel was killed in an accident as the boy hitched a ride on an ice wagon. Jacob attended DeWitt Clinton High School and Columbia University. At his mother&#x27;s urging he took violin lessons, and gave public performances, including dance band work as Jack &quot;Pinky&quot; Pearl. Sometimes he also sang and it was soon discovered he was an exceptional lyric tenor.

Peerce became the brother-in-law of fellow American tenor Richard Tucker when Sara Perelmuth, Peerce’s only sister, married Tucker, who was then a part-time cantor, in 1936. Jan remained on the Lower East Side until his 1930 marriage to Alice Kalmanovitz (1907–1994), a childhood friend to whom he was married for 54 years, until his death. He died at his home in New Rochelle, New York on December 15, 1984 at the age of 80. Peerce is interred at Mount Eden Cemetery in Valhalla, Westchester County.

==Career==
Peerce studied singing in New York City with Giuseppe Boghetti. In 1932 he was hired as a tenor soloist with the Radio City Music Hall company by the impresario Roxy, who renamed him John Pierce. They soon compromised on the spelling Jan Peerce, which the singer felt better reflected his ethnicity. Thanks to radio broadcasts on the &quot;Radio City Music Hall of the Air&quot; and stage programs, Peerce soon had a nationwide following. The legendary maestro Arturo Toscanini heard him singing Wagner on the radio and was able to contact Peerce through a mutual friend to see if he would like to audition for him. Toscanini found him to be the tenor he had sought to sing operatic and choral works with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. The recordings made during, or following, the NBC broadcasts are among the outstanding musical legacies of the mid-20th century. Toscanini was reportedly pleased with Peerce&#x27;s professionalism, as well as his musical talents and his unusually native-sounding pronunciation of Italian; many have said that Peerce was Toscanini&#x27;s &quot;favorite tenor&quot; during the Maestro&#x27;s 17 years at NBC. Peerce recalled that Toscanini never lost his temper with him the way he famously did with other musicians, even though Peerce believed he had the right to, on a few occasions. Peerce first sang publicly with Toscanini on February 6, 1938, in Carnegie Hall in an NBC broadcast performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony; the soloists also included soprano Vina Bovy, mezzo-soprano Kerstin Thorborg, and bass Ezio Pinza.
Peerce joined the roster of principal tenors at the Philadelphia La Scala Opera Company (PLSOC) in 1938. He made his professional opera debut with the company on December 10 of that year as the Duke of Mantua in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; with Robert Weede in the title role and Fritz Mahler conducting. He also sang Alfredo in &quot;La traviata&quot; with Annunciata Garrotto as Violetta and Weede as Germont during the company&#x27;s 1938-1939 season. Peerce sang in several more performance with the PLSOC through 1941, singing Pinkerton in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; with Elda Ercole as Cio-Cio-San, and reprising the roles of the Duke and Alfredo a number of times.

On October 8, 1939, Peerce created the role of Diego Columbus in the world premiere of Eugene Zador&#x27;s opera &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; at the Center Theatre. In November 1939, he performed his first solo recital in New York City. He made his debut with the Metropolitan Opera on November 29, 1941, singing Alfredo in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;. He sang also the parts of Cavaradossi in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, Rodolfo in &quot;La bohème&quot;, and in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. He was hailed by critics as the &quot;All-American successor to the &#x27;greats&#x27; of opera&#x27;s almost extinct &#x27;Golden Age&#x27;.&quot;

In December 1943, Peerce appeared in the OWI film &quot;Hymn of the Nations&quot; with Toscanini, the NBC Symphony Orchestra, and the Westminster Choir in a performance of Verdi&#x27;s then seldom-heard cantata. Filmed in NBC Studio 8-H, the soundtrack of the performance of &quot;Hymn of the Nations&quot; has been issued on LP and CD by RCA Victor, and the entire film has been released on video-cassette and DVD.

During the 1950s Peerce performed regularly as a featured soloist before audiences of over 14,000 guests under the conductor Alfredo Antonini at the Lewisohn Stadium in New York City. These &quot;Italian Night&quot; open-air concerts featured the New York Philharmonic and the Lewisohn Stadium Orchestra along with such operatic luminaries as Richard Tucker, Robert Merrill, and Eileen Farrell.

In 1956 Peerce made a sensation in Moscow as a musical &quot;cultural exchange&quot; ambassador, being the first American to sing with the famed Bolshoi Opera. He remained on the roster of the Metropolitan until 1966, appearing again in 1966-1967. He also taught a master class. In 1971 he made his Broadway debut as Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

He continued to make occasional appearances until his retirement in 1982, remaining in fine voice. His last concert was on May 2, 1982, as the guest artist with the Beth Abraham Youth Chorale in Dayton, Ohio.

==Recordings==
Peerce&#x27;s first recordings were made in 1931-1932, as a vocalist with New York area dance bands, using the names &quot;Jack Pearl&quot; and &quot;Pinky Pearl.&quot; Several of these were with the Jack Berger Orchestra, with whom he was appearing at the Hotel Astor. They include popular hits of the day such as &quot;Snuggled on Your Shoulder&quot; and &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling,&quot; and were issued on numerous smaller labels including Crown, Perfect, Banner and Melotone.

Peerce recorded almost exclusively for RCA Victor as a &quot;Red Seal&quot; artist from the late 1930s to the early 1960s. Among his first RCA Victor recordings were as a featured soloist in Nathaniel Shilkret&#x27;s 1939 tribute album to Victor Herbert. Peerce had been the tenor soloist in Toscanini&#x27;s 1938 broadcast concert of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, which was rejected for commercial release by Toscanini and RCA Victor; it wasn&#x27;t until 1952 that Toscanini approved a studio recording of that symphony (with Peerce as tenor soloist) for release.
Peerce also sang in Toscanini&#x27;s 1944 performance/broadcast of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot; with Rose Bampton, followed by the complete performances of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; (both with Licia Albanese), and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (with Herva Nelli), all eventually released by RCA Victor on LP and CD. Peerce did not sing in Toscanini&#x27;s broadcasts of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, or &quot;Falstaff&quot;; he was offered the tenor parts in the latter two but declined, believing his voice was not right for those roles. He also sang in the Madison Square Garden concert in 1944, which featured the final act of &quot;Rigoletto&quot; with Leonard Warren, Zinka Milanov, and Toscanini conducting the combined New York Philharmonic and NBC Symphony Orchestra; this performance was recorded and also released by RCA Victor on LP and CD. In 1952, he participated in Toscanini&#x27;s only studio recording of the Beethoven Ninth Symphony, which the Maestro finally approved for release by RCA Victor.

Among the operas Peerce recorded commercially for RCA Victor were Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; in 1950 with Leonard Warren singing the title role, Erna Berger, and Nan Merriman, Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; in 1951 with Risë Stevens in the title role, Licia Albanese, and Robert Merrill, and also Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; in 1957 with Roberta Peters, Philip Maero, and Giorgio Tozzi and &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, with Leonie Rysanek, Sena Jurinac, Roberta Peters, and Walter Berry, conducted also by Erich Leinsdorf. Several opera excerpt albums with Peerce were released by RCA Victor as well including &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot; with Risë Stevens and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; with Licia Albanese. Many broadcasts of performances from the Metropolitan opera and other houses with Peerce have been released on LP and CD as well. Peerce later recorded several operas and oratorios for Vanguard Records, a good majority of them Handelian.

For Westminster Records in 1961, Peerce again recorded &quot;Fidelio&quot; opposite Sena Jurinac and Beethoven&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Christ on the Mount of Olives&quot; with Maria Stader; for Columbia Records he sang the title role in a 1963 recording of selections from Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s &quot;The Student Prince&quot;, opposite Roberta Peters, and also featuring Giorgio Tozzi. Peerce&#x27;s final religious, pop, and recital albums from the late 1960s through 1980 were released by Vanguard.

Peerce&#x27;s best-selling record was his 1945 RCA Victor recording of &quot;Bluebird of Happiness&quot; (music by Sandor Harmati, lyrics by Edward Heyman and Harry Parr-Davies). It became his &quot;signature tune&quot; and he recorded it at least three times for RCA Victor. As of the late 1970s, it remained among the all-time best selling recordings by opera and concert singers. According to Peerce and his collaborator in his memoirs, &quot;Bluebird&quot; was second in sales only to Enrico Caruso&#x27;s 1918 recording of George M. Cohan&#x27;s &quot;Over There&quot;. Estimated sales of the Caruso recording by discographer John R. Bolig indicate, however, that the 1918 disc was not among the top-selling operatic recordings of the Victor Talking Machine Company. Peerce titled his 1976 autobiography &quot;The Bluebird of Happiness: The Memoirs of Jan Peerce&quot;.

==Film appearances==
Peerce was cast in a number of films including &quot;Something in the Wind&quot;, in which he played Tony the jailer. In this 1947 role, Peerce sang the &quot;Miserere&quot; from &quot;Il trovatore&quot; in a duet with his jailed charge, the film&#x27;s star, Deanna Durbin. This performance is available on DVD. In 1953 he was heard (but not seen) as the voice of the tenor-character Gregory Lawrence in &quot;Tonight We Sing&quot;, a film based upon the life of Sol Hurok. In 1969, his son Larry Peerce cast his father and his uncles Max and Sender Peerce for a scene in &quot;Goodbye Columbus&quot;, which the younger Peerce directed for Paramount Pictures.

<text>Peter Chardon Brooks Adams (June 24, 1848 – February 13, 1927) was an American attorney, historian, political scientist and a critic of capitalism.

==Early life and education==
Adams was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, on June 24, 1848, son of Charles Francis Adams and Abigail Brown Brooks. He attended schools in the United States and in Europe.

Adams was a great-grandson of Founding Father and President John Adams, a grandson of President John Quincy Adams, the youngest son of U.S. diplomat Charles Francis Adams, and brother to Charles Francis Adams Jr. and Henry Adams. He was a philosopher, historian, and novelist, whose theories of history were influenced by his work. His maternal grandfather was Peter Chardon Brooks, the wealthiest man in Boston at the time of his death.

He graduated from Harvard University in 1870 and studied at Harvard Law School in 1870 and 1871. Adams was secretary to his father in Geneva, in 1872, where the latter was an arbitrator upon the Alabama claims, under the &quot;Treaty of Washington.&quot; He was admitted to the bar in 1873, practiced law in Boston until 1881, and then devoted himself to literary work.

==Social theories==
Adams believed that commercial civilizations rise and fall in predictable cycles. First, masses of people draw together in large population centers and engage in commercial activities. As their desire for wealth grows, they discard spiritual and creative values. Their greed leads to distrust and dishonesty, and eventually the society crumbles when a new, more economically energetic society takes its place. 

In &quot;The Law of Civilization and Decay&quot; (1896), Adams noted that as new population centers emerged in the west, centers of world trade shifted from Constantinople to Venice to Amsterdam to London. This work has been compared to the later, longer works &quot;Decline of the West&quot; (1918) by Oswald Spengler and &quot;A Study of History&quot; (1934–1961) by Arnold Toynbee.

&quot;In proportion as movement accelerates societies consolidate, and as societies consolidate they pass through a profound intellectual change. Energy ceases to find vent through the imagination and takes the form of capital; hence as civilizations advance, the imaginative temperament tends to disappear, while the economic instinct is fostered and thus substantially new varieties of men come to possess the world.

Nothing so portentous overhangs humanity as this mysterious and relentless acceleration of movement, which changes methods of competition and alters paths of trade; for by it countless millions of men and women are foredoomed to happiness or misery as certainly as the beasts and trees, which have flourished in the wilderness, are destined to vanish when the soil is subdued by man.

The Romans amassed the treasure by which they administered their Empire, through the plunder and enslavement of the world. The Empire cemented by that treasure crumbled when adverse exchanges carried the bullion of Italy to the shore of the Bosphorus. An accelerated movement among the semi-barbarians of the West caused the agony of the Crusades, amidst which Constantinople fell as the Italian cities rose; while Venice and Genoa, and with them the whole Arabic civilization, shriveled when Portugal established direct communication with Hindoostan.

The opening of the ocean as a highroad precipitated the Reformation and built up Antwerp, while in the end it ruined Spain; and finally the last great quickening of the age of steam, which centralized the world at London, bathed the earth in blood from the Mississippi to the Ganges. Thus religions are preached and are forgotten, empires rise and fall, philosophies are born and die, art and poetry bloom and fade, as societies pass from the disintegration wherein imagination kindles to the consolidation whose pressure ends in death.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

Adams predicted in &quot;America&#x27;s Economic Supremacy&quot; (1900) that an &quot;Anglo-Saxon alliance&quot; would arise in opposition to China and that New York City would become the center of world trade.

==Personal life==

In 1889, Adams married Evelyn Davis, the daughter of Admiral Charles Henry Davis. They did not have children. Evelyn Davis&#x27;s sister Anna was the wife of Henry Cabot Lodge. Her sister Louisa was the wife of John Dandridge Henley Luce, the son of Stephen Luce.

Brooks Adams hired Wilhelmina Harris as social secretary for himself and his wife in 1920. Harris lived with and worked for them until both Brooks and Evelyn died.

==Recognition==

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1918.

== Legacy ==
Brooks Adams was the last Adams to live at the family home, Peacefield, in Quincy, Massachusetts. After Adams&#x27;s death, in accordance with his wishes, the house became a museum. It was first run through the family and then, later, by the National Park Service. Peacefield is now part of the Adams National Historical Park.

<doc id="1253953" wikidata="Q546793" url="?curid=1253953" title="Molopo River">
<text>The Molopo River () is one of the main rivers in Southern Africa. It has a length of approximately 960 kilometres and a catchment area of 367,201 km2 with Botswana, Namibia and South Africa sharing roughly about a third of the basin each.

==Course==

Its source is in the Molopo Oog (Eye of Molopo in Afrikaans), and the river generally flows first to the west, and then to the southwest from its source. In its middle course the Molopo River forms a significant section of the border between Botswana and South Africa.

River flow is intermittent and when it flows, its water flows very slowly owing to a gradient of only 0.76 m/km. Floods are rare because the vast sandveld areas of the Kalahari Desert on the Namibian side of its basin absorb all water from the seasonal rains. In case of exceptionally heavy and continuous precipitation the flow discharges into the Orange River, which it meets downstream of Augrabies Falls National Park at . It is believed that this last occurred more than 100 years ago.

==Tributary==
The main tributary of the Molopo is the Nossob, whose confluence is some 50 km south of Twee Rivieren, at above sea level. Other tributaries are:
*Kuruman River
*Phepane River
*Ramatlabama River
*Madebe River
*Modimola River
*Setlagoli River

==Dams==
The upper Molopo is part of the Crocodile (West) and Marico Water Management Area and the lower is included in the Lower Vaal Water Management Area. Major dams in the river are the Setumo Dam and the Disaneng Dam, both located near the city of Mafikeng, South Africa, which lies on the banks of the river.

<text>CSS Gaines was a wooden side wheel gunboat, weighing 863 tons, constructed by the Confederates at Mobile, Alabama, during 1861–62. The ship was hastily built with unseasoned wood, which was partially covered with 2-inch iron plating. &quot;Gaines&quot; resembled CSS &quot;Morgan&quot; except that she had high pressure boilers. Operating in the waters of Mobile Bay, under the command of Lieutenant John W. Bennett, CSN, she was heavily damaged during the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. She was sinking as she left the battle and became grounded while still in of water, within of Fort Morgan. Two crewman died in the engagement, 3-4 were wounded, and 129 escaped to Mobile. Her hull may have been located in Mobile Bay in 1989, but the find has not been confirmed.

<text>Rushall Olympic Football Club is an English football club based in Rushall, a former mining village that forms part of the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall. The team competes in the , the sixth tier of the English football league system.

==History==

===Early years===
Although football had been played in the village for at least 20 years previously, the earliest known reference to Rushall Olympic Football Club is in local newspaper reports on matches from the 1893–94 season. The club joined the Cannock &amp; District League in 1895, finishing as runners-up in their first season and later joined the Junior (where they were champions in 1903–04), Amateur, Parks and Senior sections of the Walsall &amp; District League.

During the inter-war years, the team won a number of local honours. At this time, the team comprised mainly local colliery workers and played on a field behind the Miners Arms pub in Rushall and changed in the pub itself. However, some time prior to the Second World War, the club disbanded.

===Post-Second World War===

In 1951, a group of local young men decided to re-form the club. They approached the proprietor of a local fish and chip shop for permission to use his premises as their headquarters and secured the use of Rowley Place as a home ground. The club joined the Walsall &amp; District Amateur League, where the team won the Second Division championship in 1952–53, and later the First Division championship in 1955–56, after which they gained promotion to the Staffordshire County League (South), where they won the Second Division title at the first attempt.

Following promotion to the First Division, the club won four championship titles between 1960 and 1965. In 1975, in a bid to gain a higher league status, the club decided to move three miles away to the Aston University Sports Ground, just off the main A34 Walsall to Birmingham road. Meanwhile, the club obtained the lease on some land in Daw End, Rushall, and the new Dales Lane ground was officially opened on 14 August 1977.

The club were accepted into the West Midlands (Regional) League in 1978, and won the First Division title in 1980. The club enjoyed 14 seasons of moderate success in the Premier Division, with a highest finish of fifth place achieved in 1988–89. In 1994, the &quot;Pics&quot; became founder members of the new Midland Football Alliance. Although the late 1990s brought only mid-table performances in the league, the Pics did defeat the then-Southern League club Rocester at the Bescot Stadium – home of Walsall – in a penalty shoot-out to lift the Walsall Senior Cup in 2000.

After finishing in second place in both 2000–01 and 2002–03, the Pics finally claimed the league title in 2004–05, and with it promotion to the Southern League Division One West. They were then transferred to the Southern League Division One Midlands for the 2006–07 season, where they stayed for two years, qualifying for the play-offs in their last season by finishing fifth.

Due to the restructuring of Northern Premier League Division One, they were transferred yet again to the NPL Division One South for the 2008–09 season, when they again finished fifth and qualified for the play-offs. They were also unsuccessful in achieving promotion this time. Manager Paul Holleran then left the club to be replaced by Neil Kitching, who started his first season brightly before tailing off to finish in mid-table; the team also reached the final of the Walsall Senior Cup under Kitching.

Despite further budget restriction, Kitching was supported by a relatively youthful backroom staff, including Nick Amos and Ian Cooper, and they went on to finish third in the 2010–11 season, before going on to reach the play-off final, after a 3–0 win over Brigg Town in the semi-final. A 2–0 victory over Grantham Town in the final saw Rushall Olympic reach the Northern Premier League Premier Division, the first time the club had ever reached the seventh level of the English football league system.

The first season at this higher level saw Rushall Olympic finish eighth in the league. They reached the final of three cup competitions: the league cup, where they lost to North Ferriby United after extra time; the Staffordshire Senior Cup, where they lost to Kidsgrove Athletic; and the Walsall Senior Cup, which they retained. Rushall also equalled their best ever performance in the FA Cup, reaching the fourth qualifying round, where they were knocked out by Stourbridge.

In 2012–13, Rushall made their debut in the first round proper of the FA Trophy, having qualified with victories over Woodford United, Chasetown and Droylsden. Their reward was a trip to Wrexham, where they suffered a defeat against a team that went on to win the final of the competition. In the league, Rushall again were on the verge of the play-offs finishing in sixth position, but failed to make the end of season competition.

In 2013–14, Rushall Olympic made the fourth qualifying round of the FA Cup before losing out at Grimsby Town. Rushall eventually finished in seventh place in the league, narrowly missing out on the play-offs. However, there were two cup final appearances, as the Pics lost out in the final of the Walsall Senior Cup but won the Staffordshire Senior Cup, beating Port Vale 2–1 at Vale Park. At the end of the season, the club parted company with manager of five years Neil Kitching; his assistant, Nick Amos, also left the club. Rushall then appointed former West Bromwich Albion and Bolton Wanderers midfielder Richard Sneekes as manager, with Steve Hinks as his assistant.

During the 2022-23 Southern Football League season, Olympic finished 5th in the table and qualified for the playoffs. The Pics defeated Coalville Town on penalty kicks and advanced to the playoff finals, where they defeated Nuneaton Borough, also on penalty kicks. As a result, the club was promoted to the National League North for the first time in club history.

<text>Charles Francis Adams IV (May 2, 1910 – January 5, 1999) was an American electronics industrialist, United States Naval officer, great-great grandson of the sixth president John Quincy Adams and great-great-great-grandson of the second president John Adams.

==Early life==
Charles Francis Adams IV was born on May 2, 1910, in Boston, Massachusetts, to United States Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams III (1866–1954), thus a great-great-great-grandson of U.S. President John Adams and great-great-grandson of his son John Quincy Adams. He attended St. Mark&#x27;s School, graduated from Harvard College in 1932 and attended Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration.

<doc id="1253986" wikidata="Q288101" url="?curid=1253986" title="Roberta Peters">
<text>Roberta Peters (May 4, 1930 – January 18, 2017) was an American coloratura soprano.

One of the most prominent American singers to achieve lasting fame and success in opera, Peters is noted for her 35-year association with the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, among the longest such associations between a singer and a company in opera. She was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1998.

==Early life and career==
Peters was born Roberta Peterman in The Bronx, New York City, the only child of Ruth (née Hersch), a milliner, and Solomon Peterman, a shoe salesman. Her family was Jewish. Encouraged by tenor Jan Peerce, she started her music studies at age 13 with William Herman, a voice teacher known for his exacting and thorough teaching method. Under Herman&#x27;s training, Peters studied the French, German and Italian languages and practiced singing scales from a clarinet method. After six years of training, Herman introduced her to impresario Sol Hurok, who arranged for an audition with Rudolf Bing, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera. Bing asked her to sing the Queen of the Night&#x27;s second aria from &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (with its four Fs above high C), several times, listening from all parts of the hall to make sure she could fill the hall with sound. He scheduled her to sing the role in February 1951.

Peters however made her debut earlier than planned. On November 17, 1950, Bing phoned her asking if she could step in to replace Nadine Conner, who was ill, as Zerlina in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. Peters knew the role, but had not yet ever performed on stage or even sung with a full orchestra; nevertheless, she accepted. Fritz Reiner was the conductor that night. Despite a reputation for being distant and reserved, Reiner made a point of coming to Peters&#x27;s dressing room to encourage her and guided her through the performance. Her performance was received with great enthusiasm, and her career was established.

Combining an attractive voice with sparkling coloratura agility and good looks, Peters became a favorite of American audiences and a great proponent of opera for the masses. She quickly established herself in the standard soubrette and coloratura repertoire. Her roles at the Met included Susanna in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;; Despina in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;; the Queen of the Night in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;; Amore in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot;; Marzeline in Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;; Rosina in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;; Adina in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;; Norina in &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;; Oscar in &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot;; Nanetta in &quot;Falstaff&quot;; Olympia in &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;; Sophie in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;; Zerbinetta in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;; and Adele in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. She later added lyric-coloratura roles such as Amina in &quot;La sonnambula&quot;, Lucia in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; and Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot;, the last being her farewell role at the Met in 1985.

Peters also appeared frequently with the Cincinnati Opera, as well as in numerous cities around the United States while on tour with the Met. Over the years, she expanded her repertoire to include roles such as &quot;Lakmé&quot;, Juliette in &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;, and occasionally performing Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;, and Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot;.

Peters also appeared abroad as early as 1951, when she sang at the Royal Opera House in London, in Balfe&#x27;s &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. From the mid-1950s onwards, she appeared in several opera houses in Italy, the Vienna State Opera, the Salzburg Festival, and the Bolshoi in Moscow, in 1972.

Peters was as popular on television as on the stage. She appeared regularly on such programs as &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. On the Sunday night CBS variety program &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, Peters was its most frequent guest, appearing a record 65 times. She also appeared in several television commercials, including a memorable entry in American Express&#x27; &quot;Do You Know Me?&quot; campaign, in which she hailed a taxi at the top of her voice.

Peters also had an extensive career as a recitalist, appearing in concert halls throughout the United States. Early in her career in 1962, she performed before an audience of over 13,000 at the popular outdoor &quot;Italian Night&quot; concert series at Lewisohn Stadium in New York under the direction of conductor Alfredo Antonini.

Later in her career she added operetta and musical theater to her repertoire, appearing in &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, and &quot;The King and I&quot;. She also recorded Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Carousel&quot; with Alfred Drake. Peters never officially retired and gave occasional recitals later in life.

==Personal life and death==
Peters was briefly married to baritone Robert Merrill in 1952, later admitting she had fallen in love with the voice and not the man. The two divorced amicably, remained friends and continued to perform together in opera and recitals. She married Bertram Fields in 1955. Their marriage produced two sons. Fields died in 2010.

Peters died of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on January 18, 2017, at age 86.

<text>Charles Kendall Adams (January 24, 1835 – July 26, 1902) was an American educator and historian. He served as the second president of Cornell University from 1885 until 1892, and as president of the University of Wisconsin from 1892 until 1901. At Cornell he established a new law school, built a library, and appointed eminent research professors for the Ivy League school. At Wisconsin, he negotiated ever-increasing appropriations from the state legislature, especially for new buildings such as the library. He was the editor-in-chief of Johnson&#x27;s Universal Cyclopaedia (1892–1895), and of the successor Universal Cyclopaedia (1900), sometimes referred to as Appleton&#x27;s Universal Cyclopaedia.

==Biography==
He was born on January 24, 1835, in Derby, Vermont, and he attended the common schools in that place till 1855, when, with his parents, he emigrated to Denmark, Iowa, where he entered an academy and commenced the study of Latin and Greek with the purpose of entering college. In the summer of 1857 he began the classical course at the University of Michigan, where he studied with Andrew Dickson White, Cornell&#x27;s first president, and from where he graduated in 1861.

Taking a post-graduate course of study, he was employed to teach one of the classes in history, and at the end of the year was appointed instructor of history and Latin. In 1863 Adams became assistant professor of Latin and history at Michigan, a position which he held till 1867, when he became full professor of history until 1885. In 1867 and 1868, was spent in Germany having studied in the universities of Bonn, Heidelberg, Leipzig, Berlin, and Munich, where his object was to observe the methods of advanced instruction; about four months were passed in Italy and France, chiefly in Rome and Paris. In 1869 and 1870 established an historical seminary which proved of great value in promoting the study of history and political science. In 1881 he was made non-resident professor of history at Cornell, and in 1885 succeeded White as president of Cornell. He was forced to resign at Cornell due to conflicts with the faculty over honorary degrees and control of faculty appointments. Also in 1881, he was simultaneously invited to the presidency of the University of Kansas and the University of Nebraska, both of which positions were declined.

He received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Chicago in 1874, and from Harvard in 1886. In 1887 Adams was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. In 1890 he was president of the American Historical Association. He resigned his professorship in May, 1892, and in July of the same year he was elected president of the University of Wisconsin, where he remained until October 11, 1901. He died on July 26, 1902, in Redlands, California, where he had moved in hopes of improving his health.

<text>Edwin Adams (February 3, 1834 – October 28, 1877) was an American stage actor, considered to have been one of America&#x27;s best light comedians.

He was born in Medford, Massachusetts, and worked &quot;at a mechanical trade in Boston&quot; before he became an actor.

Adams began his career on the stage in &quot;The Hunchback&quot;, at the National Theatre in Boston in 1853. He also appeared in &quot;Hamlet&quot; with Kate Josephine Bateman in 1860, as well in &quot;The Serf&quot; in 1865, and &quot;The Dead Heart&quot;, &quot;Wild Oats&quot;, &quot;The Lady of Lyons&quot;, &quot;Narcisse&quot;, and &quot;The Marble Heart&quot;.

He was a member of the Actors&#x27; Order of Friendship (AOOF). A benevolent association started in 1849 with chapters in Philadelphia and New York City.

Although he apparently was not involved personally with the group, Adams allowed use of his name for the 1865 creation of the Adams&#x27;s Dramatic Association in Pittsburgh.

In 1867, Adams joined Edwin Booth&#x27;s acting company, appearing in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Narcisse&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, and &quot;Enoch Arden&quot;, becoming the creator of the Arden role. From 1870 to 1875, Adams toured the country performing his best-known roles.

Adams toured Australia in 1876 and became ill while he was there. After he returned to the United States, he was the recipient of a benefit at the California Theatre in San Francisco.

His last appearance was at the California Theatre in San Francisco in 1876. His health failed on a visit to Australia, and he died in Philadelphia in 1877. He is buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery.

<text>Nicholas Joseph Callan (22 December 1799 – 10 January 1864) was an Irish physicist and Catholic priest known for his work on the induction coil.

==Early life and education==
He was born and raised in Dundalk, County Louth, where he attended school at an academy. His local parish priest, Father Andrew Levins, then took him in hand as an altar boy and Mass server, and saw him start the priesthood at Navan seminary. He entered Maynooth College in 1816. In his third year at Maynooth, Callan studied natural and experimental philosophy under Cornelius Denvir. He introduced the experimental method into his teaching and had an interest in electricity and magnetism.

Callan was ordained a priest in 1823 and went to Rome to study at Sapienza University, obtaining a doctorate in divinity in 1826. While in Rome he became acquainted with the work of the pioneers in electricity such as Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) who was a pioneer in bioelectricity and Alessandro Volta (1745–1827) who is known especially for the development of the electric battery. In 1826, Callan returned to Maynooth as the new professor of natural philosophy (now called physics), where he also began working with electricity in his basement laboratory at the college.

==Induction coil==
Influenced by William Sturgeon and Michael Faraday, Callan began work on the idea of the induction coil in 1834. He invented the first induction coil in 1836. An induction coil produces an intermittent high-voltage alternating current from a low-voltage direct current supply. It has a primary coil consisting of a few turns of thick wire wound around an iron core and subjected to a low voltage (usually from a battery). Wound on top of this is a secondary coil made up of many turns of thin wire. An iron armature and make-and-break mechanism repeatedly interrupts the current to the primary coil, producing a high-voltage, rapidly alternating current in the secondary circuit.

Callan invented the induction coil because he needed to generate a higher level of electricity than currently available. He took a bar of soft iron, about long, and wrapped it around with two lengths of copper wire, each about long. Callan connected the beginning of the first coil to the beginning of the second. Finally, he connected a battery, much smaller than the enormous contrivance just described, to the beginning and end of the winding one. He found that when the battery contact was broken, a shock could be felt between the first terminal of the first coil and the second terminal of the second coil.

Further experimentation showed how the coil device could bring the shock from a small battery up to the strength level of a big battery. So, Callan tried making a bigger coil. With a battery of only 14 seven-inch (178 mm) plates, the device produced power enough for an electric shock &quot;so strong that a person who took it felt the effects of it for several days&quot;. Callan thought of his creation as a kind of electromagnet; but what he actually made was a primitive induction transformer.

Callan&#x27;s induction coil also used an interrupter that consisted of a rocking wire that repeatedly dipped into a small cup of mercury (similar to the interrupters used by Charles Page). Because of the action of the interrupter, which could make and break the current going into the coil, he called his device the &quot;repeater.&quot; Actually, this device was the world&#x27;s first transformer. Callan had induced a high voltage in the second wire, starting with a low voltage in the adjacent first wire. And the faster he interrupted the current, the bigger the spark. In 1837 he produced his giant induction machine: using a mechanism from a clock to interrupt the current 20 times a second, it generated sparks, an estimated 60,000 volts and the largest artificial bolt of electricity then seen.

==The &#x27;Maynooth Battery&#x27; and other inventions==
Callan experimented with designing batteries after he found the models available to him at the time to be insufficient for research in electromagnetism. &quot;The Year-book of Facts in Science and Art,&quot; published in 1849, has an article titled &quot;The Maynooth Battery&quot; which begins &quot;We noticed this new and cheap Voltaic Battery in the Year-book of Facts, 1848, p. 14,5. The inventor, the Rev. D. Callan, Professor of Natural Philosophy in Maynooth College, has communicated to the Philosophical Magazine, No. 219, some additional experiments, comparing the power of a cast-iron (or Maynooth) battery with that of a Grove&#x27;s of equal size.&quot; Some previous batteries had used rare metals such as platinum or unresponsive materials like carbon and zinc. Callan found that he could use inexpensive cast-iron instead of platinum or carbon. For his Maynooth battery, he used iron casting for the outer casing and placed a zinc plate in a porous pot (a pot that had an inside and outside chamber for holding two different types of acid) in the centre. Using a single fluid cell he disposed of the porous pot and two different fluids. He was able to build a battery with just a single solution.

While experimenting with batteries, Callan also built the world&#x27;s largest battery at that time. To construct this battery, he joined 577 individual batteries (&quot;cells&quot;), which used over 30 gallons of acid. Since instruments for measuring current or voltages had not yet been invented, Callan measured the strength of a battery by measuring how much weight his electromagnet could lift when powered by the battery. Using his giant battery, Callan&#x27;s electromagnet lifted 2 tons. The Maynooth battery went into commercial production in London. Callan also discovered an early form of galvanisation to protect iron from rusting when he was experimenting on battery design, and he patented the idea.

He died in 1864 and is buried in the cemetery in St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth.

==Legacy==
The Callan Building on the north campus of NUI Maynooth, a university which was part of St Patrick&#x27;s College until 1997, was named in his honour. In addition, Callan Hall in the south campus, was used through the 1990s for first-year science lectures including experimental &amp; mathematical physics, chemistry and biology. The Nicholas Callan Memorial Prize is an annual prize awarded to the best final-year student in Experimental Physics.

Adams attended the High School of Montreal (a private school founded in 1843 and closely associated with McGill University after 1852). As a pupil there, Adams received a classical education, and his knowledge of Latin was valuable later in life in his historical studies.

At the age of sixteen he entered the Applied Science Program at McGill University, where he studied geology with John William Dawson (Principal of McGill since 1852) and Bernard Harrington (who had set up the Applied Science program). In unpublished notes he described Harrington as &quot;the professor who influenced me chiefly.&quot;

He graduated with first class honors in Applied Science in 1878, then spent a year at the Yale Scientific School, where he studied German, French, and mineralogy. It was there that he met George Wessel Hawes (1848-1882) a pioneer American petrologist, who had worked with Harry Rosenbusch in Germany. He also met a fellow-student, Andrew Cowper Lawson, and in 1888 they published a joint paper on their investigation of the mineral scapolite. Returning to Montreal, he was appointed Assistant Chemist at the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), and the following year (when the GSC moved to Ottawa), Assistant Chemist and Petrographer. He received a leave of absence to spend at least part of two years in Heidelberg, studying with Harry Rosenbusch, who by that time was the acknowledged master of microscopic petrography of igneous rocks. Rosenbusch attracted students from many different countries. While Adams was in Heidelberg he met G.H. Williams and J.S. Diller, both of whom later became leading American petrologists, as well as Victor Goldschmidt and (Carl) Alfred Osann (1859–1923), who became famous geochemists in Europe.

In 1883, Adams published the first work in Canada that made full use of the petrographic microscope, as well as a paper indicating that he had already begun the field work north of Montreal, that later became the basis of his doctorate at Heidelberg. He received a master&#x27;s degree from McGill in 1884, and his Ph.D. from Heidelberg University in 1892. His doctoral studies on the Morin anorthosite showed that these rocks were not metamorphosed sediments, as thought previously, but were igneous rocks that had been intruded into Grenville sediments and later metamorphosed in the Grenville orogeny.

==Career==

In 1889 Adams was appointed Lecturer in Geology at McGill University. He was appointed Logan Professor of Geology after the retirement of John William Dawson in 1892 and held this position until his own retirement in 1924. Though he was working full-time at McGill, he continued to spend summers in the field, financed by the GSC. In 1891 he began working on the Grenville of eastern Ontario, and by the following year had started to work on the Haliburton, Ontario area. His work there, carried out after 1896 with Alfred Barlow of the GSC, was published as a GSC Memoir in 1908, and became a classic of Canadian geology. The rocks, which included unusual alkaline rocks, were not merely mapped, but studied in detail using petrographic and chemical methods, and firm conclusions were drawn about their petrogenesis, all of which was unusual for a GSC Memoir at that time.

At the same time, Adams was also studying the peculiar petrological characteristics of a group of alkaline intrusions of much later geological age (now known to be Early Cretaceous), called by him the &quot;Monteregian Hills.&quot; This work would be continued by his students, notably Joseph Austin Bancroft (1882-1957), who succeeded Adams as Logan Professor at McGill. Inspired by his observations on the flow of metamorphosed limestones in the Grenville, Adams began a series of pioneer experimental studies of the physical properties of rocks at high pressures and temperatures, carried out in collaboration with John Thomas Nicholson, Professor of Engineering at McGill. This was well before comparable work was carried out in Germany or the United States. Though the experimental apparatus was primitive compared with that later developed at Harvard University and the Geophysical Laboratory in Washington, D.C., Adams&#x27; work was highly regarded by the newly founded Carnegie Institution for Science, which supported him financially, and attempted to persuade him to move to the Institution.

Adams remained at McGill, where he served as the Dean of the Faculty of Applied Science and then as Vice-Principal to the University. He served as President of the International Geological Congress held in Toronto in 1913, and was President of the Geological Society of America in 1917. He received many honors during his career, first becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1896, a Fellow of the Royal Society (of Great Britain) in 1907, an International member of the American Philosophical Society in 1916, a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1917, an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1920, and awarded the Flavelle Medal, which is given for outstanding contributions to biological science, in 1937. The Frank Dawson Adams Building at McGill University is named in his honor. A plaque in his honor was erected on the Redpath Museum on the McGill campus in 1950.

He retired from McGill in 1924, and began to travel widely, collecting books on the history of geology, as well as rocks and minerals for McGill. He published several papers on the geology of Ceylon and also on the history of geology, culminating in his book &quot;Birth and Development of the Geological Sciences&quot; (1938). It became a classic and was reprinted by Dover Publications in 1954. He left his rare book collection (1581 monographs) to McGill university.

<text>The VFA-201, Strike Fighter Squadron was an aviation unit of the United States Naval Reserve based at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas (USA). It was established in 1970 as part of Reserve Carrier Air Wing 20 (CVWR-20) and deactivated in 2007. During its service VFA-201 could be identified by the tail code &quot;AF&quot; and nose numbers (MODEX) in the &quot;100&quot; series, typically 100 to 113. The squadron&#x27;s nickname was the &quot;Hunters.&quot;

==History==

The United States Naval Reserve fighter squadron VF-201 was established at NAS Dallas on 25 July 1970, succeeding VF-124D1. It first flew the Vought F-8H Crusader, and in 1976 it transitioned to the McDonnell Douglas F-4N Phantom II. In 1984, the squadron transitioned to the F-4S Phantom II, the most advanced Phantom to enter service with the United States Navy. Soon the U.S. Navy moved to the policy that reserve units would have the same equipment as front line units, VF-201 transitioned to the Grumman F-14A Tomcat in early 1987 and was the last Navy squadron to fly the F-4. It took six months to complete the transition and soon VF-201 was carrier qualified on board the aircraft carrier . Even some of the F-14As received came directly from the production line at Grumman, and the unit received the final F-14A ever built. Within years the squadron was capable of dropping unguided bombs, cluster munitions TALD decoys, air laid mines, practice bombs, marker flares and various laser-guided bombs as the F-14 was reconfigured as a strike fighter. In 1993 they won the Battle &quot;E&quot; award and in 1994 the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Safety &quot;S&quot; award. The strike capability of the F-14 has been proven in exercises such as the deployment the squadron made to NAS Fallon in 1995 as part of training for the reserve air wing CVWR-20.

Later the unit would also be able to conduct TARPS reconnaissance missions, which were originally carried out by VF-202. But as some front line F-14 squadrons saw disestablishment during the 1990s, so did the two reserve fighter squadrons and VF-202 was disestablished. Due to budgetary cutbacks in active fleet aggressor squadrons, VF-201 also began flying as aggressors when needed. In 1996 VF-201, along with the rest of RCVW-20, deployed on the , during this deployment VF-201 had the opportunity to fire live weapons. The unit fired 7 AIM-9 Sidewinders, 6 AIM-7 Sparrows and 1 AIM-54 Phoenix, two additional Phoenix missiles were planned to be fired but due to technical difficulties this was aborted. VF-201 also dropped 17,000 lb of bombs.

In July 1996 VF-201 deployed to NAS Key West in Florida to provide dissimilar air training for VFA-106 &quot;Gladiators&quot;, the U.S. East Coast F/A-18 training squadron. In August and September the same year, VF-201 deployed to NAS Oceana and got to fire two Phoenix missiles as well as participating in the SFARP (Strike Fighter Air Readiness Program) course. In November 1996 VF-201 deployed to NAS Fallon where they provided Dissimilar Air Combat Training (DACT) for Carrier Air Wing Two. After this deployment to NAS Fallon, VF-201 moved to NAS Fort Worth.

In 1997 the &quot;Hunters&quot; deployed for three days with six aircraft to Elmendorf AFB, Alaska for Exercise &quot;Arctic Express 1-97&quot;. Originally this deployment had been scheduled for an active F-14 squadron, but they were unable to attend and so VF-201 filled the slot. Less than two weeks later. In late January, VF-201 took part in a scheduled deployment to NAS Fallon and the squadron dropped 195,000 lb of ordnance and shoot 3500 rounds of 20 mm cannon ammo. In March, VF-201 deployed to NAS Key West for a two-week detachment providing training to new F-14 crews from VF-101.

In January 1999 the &quot;Hunters&quot; transitioned to the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18A Hornet because the F-14 Tomcat was out of production and the Navy senior leadership wanted the F-14As in the Naval Air Reserve reassigned back to active duty F-14 squadrons. VF-201 was re-designated VFA-201 to signify its new multi-mission capability as a strike fighter squadron.

Some of their deployments included:
Carrier detachments:
USS Dwight D. Eisenhower,
USS John F. Kennedy,
USS Kitty Hawk, and the
USS John C. Stennis.

Tours of Duty locations:
Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico,
Sigonella Airbase, Sicily,
Key West NAS, FL.,
Fallon, NV.,
Oceana, VA.,
Point Magu, CA., and
Eglin AFB, FL.

=== 2003 combat deployment ===
VFA-201 was the seventh tactical Navy reserve squadron mobilized since the Korean War (three East Coast based and three West Coast based USNR squadrons were activated during the Vietnam war on 28 January 1968), and were one of three reserve squadrons to deploy for combat operations (the other two were HCS-4 and HCS-5). After completing the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program (SFARP) from their home base in Fort Worth and the Carrier Air Wing Eight coordinated strike detachment in Fallon, Nevada, they deployed on board from 6 January to 29 May 2003, where they received numerous awards for their performance over Iraq during the first phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In fact, the squadron delivered over 220,000 pounds of ordnance on Iraq targets. Additionally, VFA-201 had an unprecedented 84.6 target acquisition rate during Iraqi Freedom and won the Carrier Air Wing Eight landing grade competition for their entire workup and combat deployment. Eighteen of the nineteen pilots deployed were graduates of TOPGUN.

=== Decommissioning ===

VFA-201 was officially deactivated on 30 June 2007, and all hardware assets were transferred to their Reserve sister squadron, VFA-204, or other active-duty Navy and Marine Corps units.

<text>James Truslow Adams (October 18, 1878 – May 18, 1949) was an American writer and historian. He was a freelance author who helped to popularize the latest scholarship about American history and his three-volume history of New England is well regarded by scholars. He popularized the phrase &quot;American Dream&quot; in his 1931 book &quot;The Epic of America&quot;.

==Early life==
Adams was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a wealthy family, the son of Elizabeth Harper (née Truslow) and stockbroker William Newton Adams Jr.

His father had been born in Caracas, Venezuela. His paternal grandfather, William Newton Adams Sr., was American of English descent with roots in Virginia and his paternal grandmother, Carmen Michelena de Salias, a Venezuelan of Spanish descent with roots in eighteenth-century Gipuzkoa and Seville. The earliest paternal ancestor was Francis Adams from England, an indentured servant who settled the Province of Maryland in 1638.

Adams took his bachelor&#x27;s degree from the New York University Tandon School of Engineering (then Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn) in 1898, and a MA degree from Yale University in 1900. He entered investment banking, rising to partner in a New York Stock Exchange member firm. In 1912, he considered his savings ample enough to switch to a career as a writer.

In 1917, he served with Colonel House on President Wilson&#x27;s commission, &quot;The Inquiry&quot;, to prepare data for the Paris Peace Conference. By 1918, he was a captain in the Military Intelligence Division of the General Staff of the U.S. Army. By late 1918, he was selected for the U.S. delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. His main task consisted in the provision of maps and the selection of plans and atlases that should be acquired by the War College, the American Geographical Society, and the Library of Congress.

==Writer==
Adams gained national attention with his trilogy on the history of New England (1921–26), winning the Pulitzer Prize for the first volume. Scholars welcomed his social history of the colonial era, &quot;Provincial Society, 1690–1763&quot; (1927). He wrote popular books and magazine articles in a steady stream. His &quot;Epic of America&quot; was an international bestseller, and was included in Life Magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924–1944. He was also the editor of a scholarly multi-volume &quot;Dictionary of American History&quot;. Adams was the editor, with Roy V. Coleman as managing editor, of &quot;The Atlas of American History&quot; (New York: Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons, 1943), and &quot;The Album of American History,&quot; 4 vols. (New York: Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons, 1944).

===American Dream===
Adams coined the term &quot;American Dream&quot; in his 1931 book &quot;The Epic of America&quot;. His American Dream is &quot;that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.&quot;
However, Adams felt the American Dream was in peril during the 1920s and 30s. He complained that &quot;money making and material improvements . . . mere extensions of the material basis of existence&quot;, had gained ascendancy, becoming &quot;goods in themselves . . . [mimicking] the aspects of moral virtues.&quot; The original American Dream had always been about &quot;quality and spiritual values&quot;: &quot;The American dream that has lured tens of millions of all nations to our shores in the past century has not been a dream of merely material plenty, although that has doubtless counted heavily. It has been much more than that.&quot; He warned that &quot;in our struggle to &#x27;make a living&#x27;&quot; we were neglecting &quot;to live&quot;. &quot;The Epic of America&quot; was his attempt to save a &quot;priceless heritage&quot;, and sustain the distinctly American understanding of progress in humane and moral terms. The true American Dream was of &quot;a genuine individual search and striving for the abiding values of life&quot;, and for the &quot;common man to rise to full stature&quot; in the free realms of &quot;communal spiritual and intellectual life.&quot;

===Two educations===
A quote from one of Adams&#x27; essays &quot;There are obviously two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live&quot; is widely misattributed to John Adams. The quote is part of an essay by Adams entitled &quot;To &#x27;Be&#x27; or to &#x27;Do&#x27;: A Note on American Education&quot; which appeared in the June, 1929 issue of &quot;Forum&quot;. The essay is very critical of American education, both in school and at the university level, and explores the role of American culture and class-consciousness in forming that system of education.

In a more complete version of that quote, Adams says: There are obviously two educations. One should teach us how to make a living and the other how to live. Surely these should never be confused in the mind of any man who has the slightest inkling of what culture is. For most of us it is essential that we should make a living ... In the complications of modern life and with our increased accumulation of knowledge, it doubtless helps greatly to compress some years of experience into far fewer years by studying for a particular trade or profession in an institution; but that fact should not blind us to another—namely, that in so doing we are learning a trade or a profession, but are not getting a liberal education as human beings.

==Death==
Adams lived in Southport, Connecticut, where he died of a heart attack.

==Honors==
After 1930, Adams was active in the American Academy of Arts and Letters serving as both chancellor and treasurer of that organization. He was also a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the Massachusetts Historical Society, American Antiquarian Society, American Historical Association, and the American Philosophical Society. Among British societies, he was honored as a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

<doc id="1254003" wikidata="Q144232" url="?curid=1254003" title="Comus (band)">
<text>Comus are a British progressive folk band who had a brief career in the early 1970s. Their first album, &quot;First Utterance&quot;, has garnered them a cult following that persists to today. They reunited in 2009, and have played several festivals and released a new album called &quot;Out of the Coma&quot;.

==History==
Comus was formed in 1969 by art students Roger Wootton and Glenn Goring, who developed their musical style performing in folk clubs in and around Bromley in Kent. The band was named after &quot;Comus&quot; (a masque by John Milton), and also after the name of the Greek god Comus. The band grew from an early folk duo to a six-piece ensemble; in that later form, David Bowie came to appreciate them. They appeared regularly at his Arts Lab project in Beckenham, Kent. He also invited them to be his support act in a 1969 concert at London&#x27;s Purcell Rooms.

Their first album, &quot;First Utterance&quot;, with cover art by Wootton and Goring, appeared in 1971. The music is largely acoustic art rock (also described as acoustic metal and acid folk) that blends elements of Eastern percussion, early folk and animal-like vocals. The lyrics involve violence, murder, mental disorder and the mystical. Tiny Mix Tapes rated &quot;First Utterance&quot; five stars out of five.

After the album, woodwind player Rob Young was replaced by Lindsay Cooper, and the new lineup developed material for a never-released second album. No recording by this lineup would see the light of day for another 40 years. The group disbanded for a time, but Wootton, Andy Hellaby and Bobbie Watson reformed the band with new members for their second album, &quot;To Keep from Crying&quot;, in 1974.

A complete box set was released in 2005; this features both studio albums, their only single, &quot;Diana&quot;, and a previously unreleased track called &quot;All the Colours of Darkness&quot;. The liner notes feature an exclusive interview with some members of the band. They reformed for the Mellotronen Festival in Sweden in March 2008. They have continued to perform occasional gigs, including some new material.

On 13 June 2009, Comus performed for the first time in the UK in 37 years, at the Equinox Festival at Conway Hall.

A reunion album, &quot;Out of the Coma&quot;, was released in June 2012. It contains three new tracks: &quot;Out of the Coma&quot;, &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; (both written by Wootton) and &quot;The Return&quot; (written by Goring), plus a 1972 live recording of unfinished material from their abandoned follow-up to &quot;First Utterance&quot;, &quot;The Malgaard Suite&quot;. Sputnik Music rated &quot;Out of the Coma&quot; 3.5 out of 5. Louder Sound rated it four stars out of five.

The members were active outside Comus. Wootton also appears on some recordings by Slapp Happy. Cooper went on to join Henry Cow. Reed player Jon Seagroatt is also a member of free-improvising trio Red Square. Colin Pearson went on to produce hits for other artists, including &quot;Forever Young&quot; for Alphaville. Seagroatt and singer Bobbie Watson married in 2003.

==Influence==
In 1998, Opeth singer and songwriter Mikael Åkerfeldt used part of a sentence from &quot;Drip Drip&quot; for the title of the album &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot;. The full line was &quot;As I carry you to your grave, my arms your hearse&quot;.

The song &quot;Moonlapse Vertigo&quot; from Still Life contains the lyric &quot;Across the leafy pathway,&quot; which was taken from Comus&#x27; &quot;Diana.&quot;

Another nod to Comus was given on the 2005 Opeth album &quot;Ghost Reveries&quot;. The second track, &quot;The Baying of the Hounds&quot;, was derived from a line in the song &quot;Diana&quot; which reads, &quot;And she knows by the sound of the baying, by the baying of the hounds&quot;.

English experimental band Current 93 covered the song &quot;Diana&quot; from &quot;First Utterance&quot; on their studio album &quot;Horsey&quot;. Musically, this version differs considerably from the original, with David Tibet singing the lyrics in an agonized fashion and constructing most of the song from a loop based around a vertiginous violin arrangement from the original.

<text>Gregor Piatigorsky (, &quot;Grigoriy Pavlovich Pyatigorskiy&quot;; August 6, 1976) was a Russian-born American cellist.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gregor Piatigorsky was born in Ekaterinoslav (now Dnipro, Ukraine) into a Jewish family. As a child, he was taught violin and piano by his father. After seeing and hearing the cello at an orchestra concert, he was determined to become a cellist and was given his first cello when he was seven.

Piatigorsky won a scholarship to the Moscow Conservatory, studying with Alfred von Glehn, Anatoliy Brandukov, and a certain Gubariov. At the same time, he was earning money for his family by playing in local cafés, brothels and silent movie houses.

Piatigorsky was 13 when the Russian Revolution took place. Shortly afterward, he started playing in the Lenin Quartet. At 15, he was hired as the principal cellist for the Bolshoi Theater.

The Soviet authorities, specifically Anatoly Lunacharsky, would not allow Piatigorsky to travel abroad to further his studies, so he smuggled himself and his cello into Poland on a cattle train with a group of artists. One of the women was a heavy-set soprano who, when the border guards started shooting at them, grabbed Piatigorsky and his cello. The cello did not survive intact, but it was the only casualty.

Now 18, Piatigorsky studied briefly in Berlin and Leipzig, with Hugo Becker and Julius Klengel, playing in a trio in a Russian café to earn money for food. Among the patrons of the café were Emanuel Feuermann and Wilhelm Furtwängler. Furtwängler heard Piatigorsky and hired him as the principal cellist of the Berlin Philharmonic.

=== Family ===
In January 1937, Piatigorsky married Jacqueline de Rothschild, daughter of Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild of the wealthy Rothschild banking family of France. That fall, after returning to France, they had their first child, Jephta. After the Nazi occupation in World War II, the family left France on September 5, 1939, by boat for the United States from Le Havre and settled in Elizabethtown in the Adirondack Mountains, New York, where Piatigorsky had already bought a house. It was also his parents-in-law&#x27;s first U.S. residence after their flight from France in 1939. Their son, Joram, was born in Elizabethtown in 1940. Piatigorsky had three grandsons by Jephta (Jonathan, Evan, Eric) and two by Joram (Auran, Anton).

===United States===
In 1929, Piatigorsky first visited the United States, playing with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski and the New York Philharmonic under Willem Mengelberg.

From 1941 to 1949, Piatigorsky was head of the cello department at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and he also taught at Tanglewood, Boston University. In 1949 he moved to California because a doctor had advised him to move to a better climate to stop Joram&#x27;s constant colds and ear infections. Piatigorsky favored Los Angeles, because many of his friends, such as Rubinstein, Heifetz, and Stravinsky, lived there. He taught at the University of Southern California, with which he remained associated until his death. USC established the &quot;Piatigorsky Chair of Violoncello&quot; in 1974 to honor him.

Piatigorsky participated in a chamber group with Arthur Rubinstein (piano), William Primrose (viola) and Jascha Heifetz (violin). Referred to in some circles as the &quot;Million Dollar Trio&quot;, Rubinstein, Heifetz, and Piatigorsky made several recordings for RCA Victor.

Piatigorsky played chamber music privately with Heifetz, Vladimir Horowitz, Leonard Pennario, and Nathan Milstein. He also performed at Carnegie Hall with Horowitz and Milstein in the 1930s.

In 1965, his popular autobiography, &quot;Cellist&quot;, was published.

Gregor Piatigorsky died of lung cancer at his home in Los Angeles in 1976. He was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.

===Instrument===
He owned two Stradivarius cellos, the &quot;Batta&quot; and the &quot;Baudiot&quot;. From 1939 to 1951 Piatigorsky also owned the famous 1739 Domenico Montagnana cello known as the &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;.

==Appraisal==
The great violin pedagogue Ivan Galamian reportedly once called Piatigorsky the greatest string player of all time. He was an extraordinarily dramatic player. His orientation as a performer was to convey maximum expression. He brought a great authenticity to his understanding of this expression. He was able to communicate this authenticity because he had had extensive personal and professional contact with many of the great composers of the day.

Many of those composers wrote pieces for him, including Sergei Prokofiev (Cello Concerto), Paul Hindemith (Cello Concerto), Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco (Cello Concerto), William Walton (Cello Concerto), Vernon Duke (Cello Concerto), and Igor Stravinsky (Piatigorsky and Stravinsky collaborated on the arrangement of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Suite Italienne&quot;, which was extracted from &quot;Pulcinella&quot;, for cello and piano; Stravinsky demonstrated an extraordinary method of calculating fifty-fifty royalties). At a rehearsal of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, which Piatigorsky performed with the composer conducting, after the dramatic slow variation in D minor, Strauss announced to the orchestra, &quot;Now I&#x27;ve heard my Don Quixote as I imagined him.&quot;

Piatigorsky had a magnificent sound characterized by a distinctive fast and intense vibrato and he was able to execute with consummate articulation all manner of extremely difficult bowings, including a downbow staccato of which other string players could not help but be in awe. He often attributed his penchant for drama to his student days when he accepted an engagement playing during the intermissions in recitals by the great Russian basso Feodor Chaliapin. When portraying his dramatic roles, such as the title role in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, Chaliapin not only sang, but declaimed, almost shouting. On encountering him one day, the young Piatigorsky told him, &quot;You talk too much and don&#x27;t sing enough.&quot; Chaliapin responded, &quot;You sing too much and don&#x27;t talk enough.&quot; Piatigorsky thought about this and from that point on, tried to incorporate the kind of drama and expression he heard in Chaliapin&#x27;s singing into his own artistic expression.

==Works==
Piatigorsky was also a composer. His &quot;Variations on a Paganini Theme&quot; (based on Caprice No. 24) was composed in 1946 for cello and orchestra and orchestrated by his longtime accompanist Ralph Berkowitz; it was later transcribed for cello and piano. Each of the 15 variations whimsically portrays one of Piatigorsky&#x27;s musician colleagues. Denis Brott, a student of Piatigorsky, identified them as Casals, Hindemith, Garbousova, Morini, Salmond, Szigeti, Menuhin, Milstein, Kreisler, a self-portrait, Cassadó, Elman, Bolognini, Heifetz, and Horowitz.

==Chess==
Piatigorsky also enjoyed playing chess. His wife, Jacqueline Piatigorsky, was a strong player who played in several U.S. women&#x27;s championships and represented the U.S. in the women&#x27;s Chess Olympiad. In 1963, the Piatigorskys organized and financed a strong international tournament in Los Angeles, won by Paul Keres and Tigran Petrosian. A second Piatigorsky Cup was held in Santa Monica in 1966 and won by Boris Spassky.

<doc id="1254008" wikidata="Q7814740" url="?curid=1254008" title="Tom Adams (illustrator)">
<text>Thomas Charles Renwick Adams (March 29, 1926 – December 9, 2019) was a US-born Anglo-Scots illustrator and painter. Long active in a variety of visual formats, he is known for his work in book cover art, portrait painting, poster, advertising and album art. He is most widely known for his book cover art for the paperback editions of Agatha Christie.

==Family background and influence==
Adams was born into a family of town and urban planners. His grandfather, Thomas Adams (1871–1940), was an influential urban planner, who served as an advisor to Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt and went on to found the Civic Improvement League in 1915 and the Town Planning Institution of Canada in 1919. Indeed, it is not an exaggeration to suggest that Thomas Adams was one of the principal founders of urban planning as a discipline. His two sons went on to make their mark in American and English town and urban planning. The younger son, Frederick Johnstone Adams, was a member of the faculty of MIT from 1932 to 1964, who helped to establish the Department of Urban Studies and Planning, serving as its first Head of Department from 1944 to 1957. Tom Adams&#x27;s father, James W. Renwick Adams OBE (1898–1969), worked as a planner for the English county council of Kent. 
From this background, the strong sense of visual composition in Tom Adams&#x27;s work becomes more understandable. Moreover, Adams&#x27;s visual work is drawn to the challenge of integrating seemingly disparate elements into an integral whole.

==Early life and career==

Adams served for two years in the navy (1944–1946). He then trained at the Chelsea School of Art and Goldsmiths College, where he received a National Diploma of Painting in 1949. Between 1953 and 1960 Adams provided illustrations for the youth-oriented UK publications &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot; and &quot;Swift&quot;. In 1958, he founded Adams Design Associates with Anna and Andy Garnett, where he produced large murals in the then-new medium of laminated plastic for various firms such as the Royal Bank of Scotland, Chartered Bank, Aspro Nicholas and Airscrew Jicwood.

In 1965, Adams joined his father, the late James W.R. Adams OBE, eminent town planner and landscape architect, who was planning and design consultant to the Poster Advertising Planning Committee, for whom he helped produce a book: &quot;Posters Look to the Future&quot;.

==Creative activities==

In the 1960s and 1970s he became involved with several distinguished poets, including Edward Lucie-Smith, Ted Hughes, C. Day Lewis, Brian Patten, George MacBeth and Adrian Henri as well as artists Sandra Blow, John Piper, Josef Herman, and Mark Boyle and among others, producing poetry prints published by his own gallery, the Fulham Gallery, London. Adams also designed posters for Mark Boyle&#x27;s light shows (The Sensual Laboratory), the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Soft Machine. His connection with the modern world of rock music continued when he met Lou Reed, an admirer of his Christie and Raymond Chandler covers. Adams designed the cover for his first solo album.
During this period, Adams met Virgil Pomfret and joined his artists&#x27; agency. Apart from a few gaps when pursuing other activities (like running art galleries), Adams remained with Pomfret for many years. With Pomfret&#x27;s representation, Adams began a career as a book cover illustrator, most notably for the early John Fowles&#x27;s novels &quot;The Collector&quot;, &quot;The Magus&quot; and &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; and the now famous paperback covers for Agatha Christie (Collins UK and Simon &amp; Schuster USA). A book on these cover paintings, &quot;Tom Adams’ Agatha Christie Cover Story&quot; with commentary by Julian Symons and Introduction by John Fowles was published in 1981 by Dragons World.

He also designed several covers for Raymond Chandler. Adams also provided the illustrations for the hardback editions of John Fowles&#x27; &quot;The Collector&quot;, &quot;The Magus&quot; and &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot;. He also created the covers for Patrick White&#x27;s &quot;The Vivisector&quot;, David Storey&#x27;s &quot;Saville&quot;. &quot;Ghost Story&quot; by Peter Straub and Kingsley Amis&#x27; &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;.

Around this time, having completed a private commission to paint a portrait of Benjamin Britten in 1971, the Aldeburgh Festival committee commissioned him to produce a limited edition print with William Plomer and Mary Potter as part of the fundraising for the restoration of the Snape Maltings. His occasional portrait commissions have included HRH Prince of Wales, Benjamin Britten (twice), Federico Fellini for the Playboy organization, Bud Flanagan, Richard Dimbleby, and President Tubman of Liberia. In 1997, he was commissioned to paint a posthumous portrait of Enid Blyton, whose centenary occurred that year, by the family and estate, in the style of the Britten portrait. This was later auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s in aid of the Children&#x27;s Charity, The Royal Variety Club of Great Britain.

Tom Adams worked in films from time to time, mostly science fiction, including &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; with Nic Roeg and Mike Hodges. In music, he did covers for Lou Reed&#x27;s self-titled album and Iron Maiden&#x27;s compilation &quot;Edward the Great&quot;.

==The Agatha Christie paperback covers==
Agatha Christie was no newcomer to the paperback format. Indeed, she was part of Allen Lane’s famous ten-book launch of Penguin Books. The success of Penguin Books in the UK and PocketBooks in the US—niche paperback publishers—in the years following WWII, inspired traditional publishers to produce paperbacks. By the early 60s, Collins decided it wanted to do something more artistically distinct with Christie’s paperback covers. Impressed with Adams’s cover for John Fowles’ &quot;The Collector&quot;, Collins engaged Adams.

He was commissioned to do a trial cover of &quot;A Murder Is Announced&quot;, which was published with his cover in 1962. Everyone involved was pleased with the outcome. As a result, Adams ended up doing covers for many of Christie&#x27;s paperbacks, often more than once. The covers he primarily did not create art for were the pre-1926 books which Fontana did not have the publishing rights to. PocketBooks in the US very much wanted more realistic covers. For this reason, most of Adams&#x27;s covers for the US editions feature a single dramatic or portentous scene from the novel than spans the front and rear covers. The two exceptions are &quot;Nemesis&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of the Blue Train&quot;. Fontana in the UK was much more open to Adams&#x27;s creative input. Thus, the UK covers were often akin to a stylized tableau or surrealist collage. Adams ended up doing the covers for Agatha Christie paperbacks for twenty-eight years (1962-1980), thus becoming connected with her intimately in the minds of many readers.

==Technique and style==

Adams&#x27;s book cover artwork, while usually instantly recognizable, runs to quite distinct modes. Some covers are still-life tableaux; some are depictions of a scene in the novel; some are surrealist collations of items and images. Organizing the vast majority of them, however, is Adams&#x27;s unique exploration of a form that was vital for much of twentieth-century art: the collage.

Adams&#x27;s unique take on this was to bring the collage back into the realm of the painterly. Seen in this light, even Adams&#x27;s covers that seem like still lifes are, in actuality, juxtapositions of elements and objects that normally are not in such proximity. It is this uncanny proximity—despite (or, rather, precisely because of) the near photo-realistic accuracy—that creates the unsettling effect.

This element also goes to explain one of the most distinctive features of Adams&#x27;s art: the combination of a sought-after realistic accuracy with an unsettling, surrealist, if not alienating, effect. As Janet Morgan, Agatha Christie&#x27;s first biographer, put it, Adams&#x27;s drawings are &quot;alarmingly realistic.&quot;

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
Adams&#x27; design for the Fontana Books edition of the Agatha Christie mystery &quot;Death in the Clouds&quot;, featuring a giant wasp, inspired the monster in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; adventure &quot;The Unicorn and the Wasp&quot;, broadcast in 2008. A copy of the book, featuring Adams&#x27; cover, appeared in the episode. 
==Awards and publications==

Adams won various awards for illustration, notably the American Society of Illustrators, The American Art Directors Association, and The Design and Art Directors Association, UK. His work is in numerous private collections and he exhibited in London, Toronto, Tokyo, Dublin, Sydney, Marbella, and more recently in Exeter and Torquay, the setting for many of Agatha Christie&#x27;s mysteries. He designed, printed and published his own limited editions.

Two monographs have been published on his work: &quot;Tom Adams&#x27; Agatha Christie Cover Story&quot; (published as &quot;Agatha Christie: The Art of Her Crimes&quot; in the United States), Paper Tiger, 1981 and &quot;Tom Adams Uncovered&quot;, HarperCollins, 2015.

<doc id="1254019" wikidata="Q1249472" url="?curid=1254019" title="Rich Man, Poor Man (novel)">
<text>Rich Man, Poor Man is a 1969 novel by Irwin Shaw. It is the last of the novels of Shaw&#x27;s middle period before he began to concentrate, in his last works such as &quot;Evening In Byzantium&quot;, &quot;Nightwork&quot;, &quot;Bread Upon The Waters&quot; and &quot;Acceptable Losses&quot; on the inevitability of impending death. The title is taken from the nursery rhyme &quot;Tinker, Tailor&quot;. The novel was adapted into a 1976 miniseries.

==Background==
The novel is a sprawling work, with over 600 pages, and covers many of the themes Shaw returns to again and again in all of his fiction – Americans living as expatriates in Europe, the McCarthy era, children trying to break away from the kind of life lived by their parents, social and political issues of capitalism, and the pain of relationships. On the very first page Shaw subtly telegraphs the sad ending of the story, in the same way that the first scene of a film will often quote the last scene.

Originally published as a short story in &quot;Playboy Magazine&quot;, it became an international bestseller when published as a novel. The bulk of the novel concerns the three children of German Americans Mary Pease and Axel Jordache – the eldest, Gretchen, the middle child, Rudolph, and the youngest, Thomas. It chronicles their experiences from the end of World War II until the late 1960s.

==Plot summary==

In the early parts of the novel Shaw goes to great lengths to make the point about &quot;Jordache blood&quot; – violent, bitter, resentful. One of the ways he does this is by meticulously describing the hate-filled marriage of the parents, Mary and Axel. The novel is told in the third person omniscient point of view but never wholly objectively, often through the lens of the consciousness of one of the five family members. When told through the POV of either Mary or Axel the view of humanity, and of the Jordache family, is relentlessly bleak and pessimistic.

The tripwire that sets all of the ensuing plot action in motion occurs when Gretchen Jordache begins an affair with the president of the company she works for, Teddy Boylan, a man much older than herself. Eventually her brothers Rudolph and Thomas also become involved with Boylan, in different ways, and it is his influence upon all three that first springs each of them into the world beyond the small upstate New York town where their parents scrape by with their bakery. Boylan constitutes their first true encounters with an adult beyond their parents.

Many people, mainly because of their familiarity with the miniseries rather than the actual source material, thought of the story as a very simplistic juxtaposition of the virtuous, goody two shoes brother (Rudolph) with the black sheep, ne&#x27;er-do-well younger sibling (Thomas, whom Shaw seeks to differentiate psychologically by means of a physical symbol – he is the only blond haired member of the family), but the novel is much more complex than this in its demonstrative understructure. For example, Rudolph is constantly developing positive relationships only with people who can help him - his father, Mr. Calderwood, Johnny Heath, Boylan. In stark contrast to this both Gretchen and Thomas consistently entangle themselves with the kinds of people that modern self-help literature calls &quot;drain people&quot; or &quot;toxic people&quot;. A couple of examples: Thomas&#x27; only friend in the world, Claude, gives him up immediately to the authorities the second his own well-being is threatened, and when Axel Jordache learns of Tom&#x27;s actions his only impulse is to get rid of him, to send him away to live with family in Ohio. Contrast this with Rudolph&#x27;s friend, Johnny Heath, who becomes his lifelong friend, attorney, and business partner, and also with what Axel Jordache does when confronted by Rudolph&#x27;s French teacher over a behavior miscue – he slaps the teacher in the face.

Boylan serves as the MacGuffin that drives the plot for all three of the Jordache siblings. For Gretchen he is an introduction to the world of men and relationships. He awakens in her the realization that she is the kind of woman who reduces men to cowering wimps but who cannot, perhaps somewhat paradoxically, put together a sound, completely fulfilling relationship. Her marriage to Willie Abbott collapses under the weight of his alcoholism and her marriage to Colin Burke ends in tragedy when Burke dies in a car accident. Similarly none of her numerous affairs bear any genuine emotional fruit.

It is because of Boylan that Thomas embarks on a savage act of vandalism (with his friend Claude, who eventually turns him in). When caught, the men of the town present Axel Jordache with a choice – send Thomas away or let him and the family face the consequences with the law. Jordache sends him away to live with his brother in Ohio, thus beginning a pattern that is repeated over and over and over in the novel: Thomas settles somewhere for a while, does OK for a time, then gets into trouble and has to flee.

Finally Boylan offers to pay for Rudolph to go to college. Although on one level Rudolph despises Boylan as a petty vindictive rich pervert of an old man, he sees another side of him as well - the financially independent man of the world who wants for nothing. Shaw uses Rudolph&#x27;s even, balanced judgment of Boylan as a counterpoint to the wholly negative, wholly one-sided opinion of him both Gretchen and Thomas, in their own separate ways, cling to.

==Adaptations==
A 1976 miniseries adaptation of the novel premiered on ABC and starred Peter Strauss as Rudy, Susan Blakely as Julie and Nick Nolte as Tom.

In 1982, an adaptation of Shaw&#x27;s novel was realised by &quot;Lithuanian Film Studios&quot; of the Soviet TV. 

In 2011, a Turkish drama was also an adaptation of &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; with a different twist: in &quot;Kuzey Güney&quot; miniseries, starring Kıvanç Tatlıtuğ, Buğra Gülsoy and Öykü Karayel, Kuzey was shown as the tough, wild and rebellious son (but inside he was noble and child hearten person) and Güney was shown as an responsible, calm and clean son of a hate-filled couple Sami and Handan Tekinoglu of Istanbul.

==Sequel==
Shaw released a sequel to the novel titled, &quot;Beggarman, Thief&quot; in 1977.

<text>Jon Michael Geoffrey Manningham Adams (September 24, 1931 – March 11, 1985), known as Tom Adams, was a Barbadian politician who served as the second Prime Minister of Barbados from 1976 until 1985.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
The only son of Sir Grantley Adams (a lawyer and the only Premier of the West Indies Federation) and Grace Adams ( Thorne), Tom Adams was educated at Harrison College, from which he won a BarbadosScholarship to Magdalen College of the University of Oxford.

===Prime minister===
He served as the second Prime Minister of Barbados between 1976 and 1985. His party, the Barbados Labour Party (BLP), had capitalized on the population&#x27;s desire for a change from Errol Barrow&#x27;s Democratic Labour Party, which had governed the island since independence in 1966.

Adams moved the country back towards the liberalism the BLP had been founded on, a trend in keeping with the popularity of liberal economist Friedrich Hayek in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Britain and Ronald Reagan&#x27;s United States in the early 1980s.

In 1983, Adams was the leading proponent in the grouping of Eastern Caribbean states that asked Reagan to intervene when a leadership struggle within the Leninist ruling party on Grenada ended in bloodshed. On Oct. 12, a military-backed, insurgent faction led by Bernard Coard, Grenada&#x27;s deputy prime minister, ousted Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and put him under house arrest. When Bishop&#x27;s followers sought to restore him to power a week later, he and seven of his most loyal followers were executed by a Grenadian military firing squad. Adams was convinced that further disorder on Grenada was inevitable and posed a threat to the entire region. He brokered support for an intervention in secret diplomatic dealings with the Reagan administration and like-minded leaders in the English-speaking Caribbean. Barbados was used as a staging point for some of the U.S. forces, and a nominal contingent of the Barbados Defence Force accompanied in the invasion force&#x27;s wake, not least to allow (as Barrow claimed) Reagan to gild the statistics. The Barbadian population was of two minds about Adams&#x27; move, generally conceding that Bishop&#x27;s murder had moved Grenada too far, but being uneasy with Reagan&#x27;s US heavy-handedness. Nevertheless, Adams&#x27; BLP was tipped to win the upcoming elections at the time. During his tenure as prime minister, he held the additional portfolio of Minister of Finance.

Adams died of a heart attack at Ilaro Court, the Prime Minister&#x27;s official residence, on March 11, 1985. He was the first sitting Prime Minister of Barbados to die in office. He was buried in Bridgetown, Barbados, at the churchyard of the Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels on Saint Michael&#x27;s Row.

Queen Elizabeth II was among global leaders who sent condolence as was addressed to Sir Hugh Springer, the then Governor-General of Barbados, which read:
″I was very shocked to hear of the sudden death of the prime minister, and Prince Philip and I send our deepest sympathy to the government and people of Barbados. The distinguished service given by Tom Adams to Barbados and to the Commonwealth (of Britain and its former colonies) during nine years as prime minister will always be remembered.″

Adams&#x27; deputy Prime Minister, Bernard St. John, succeeded him but the Barbadian electorate turned back to the other political party, voting in Errol Barrow, and his Democratic Labour Party in the subsequent election in 1986. Barrow also died in office in 1987 shortly after his election victory.

Many international leaders throughout the Commonwealth Caribbean and members of the resident diplomatic corp presented condolence.

== Legacy ==
The ten-story building in Bridgetown which houses the Central Bank of Barbados is today known as the Tom Adams Financial Centre in his honour. He is also one of the namesakes of the island&#x27;s ABC Highway.

In 2017, he released a six-episode web show with his wife, Megan Wallace Cunningham, titled &quot;Couple Thinkers&quot;. In 2021, he hosted &quot;The Hustler&quot;, television game show that aired on ABC from 4 January to 23 September 2021.

Ferguson has written three books: &quot;Between the Bridge and the River&quot;, a novel; &quot;American on Purpose&quot; (2009), a memoir; and &quot;Riding the Elephant: A Memoir of Altercations, Humiliations, Hallucinations &amp; Observations&quot; (2019).

==Early life and education==
Ferguson was born on 17 May 1962 in Stobhill Hospital in the Springburn district of Glasgow, to Robert (1930–2006), a post office worker and Scottish Nationalist, and Janet Ferguson (1933–2008), a primary school teacher. When he was six months old, he and his family moved from their Springburn flat to a Development Corporation house in the nearby New Town of Cumbernauld, where he grew up &quot;chubby and bullied&quot;. They lived there as Cumbernauld was rehousing many Glaswegians away from the poor housing conditions and damage to the city from World War II. Ferguson attended Muirfield Primary School and Cumbernauld High School. At age 16, Ferguson left high school and began an apprenticeship to be an electronics technician at a local factory of American company Burroughs Corporation. Ferguson has two sisters (one older and one younger) and one older brother. His younger sister, Lynn Ferguson Tweddle, is also a comedian, presenter and actress, who voiced Mac in the 2000 stop-motion animation film &quot;Chicken Run&quot;. She was a writer on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; until July 2011.

His first visit to the United States was in 1975, when he was 13, to visit an uncle who lived on Long Island, near New York City. When he moved to New York City in 1983, he worked in construction in Harlem. He was later a bouncer at the nightclub Save the Robots before returning to the United Kingdom.

==Career==
===UK career===
Ferguson&#x27;s entertainment career began as a teenager, drumming for Glasgow punk bands such as the Night Creatures and Exposure. He then had a brief stint as a drummer for the post-punk band Ana Hausen, which released a single for Human Records in 1981. Following that, he joined punk band The Bastards from Hell, later renamed the Dreamboys, and fronted by vocalist and future actor Peter Capaldi. They performed regularly in Glasgow from 1980 to 1982. Ferguson credits Capaldi for inspiring him to try comedy. When Ferguson was 18, he worked as a session musician and performed as a drummer for Nico during a few gigs when she toured Scotland.

After a nerve-wracking first comedy appearance, he decided to create a character he described as a &quot;parody of all the über-patriotic native folk singers who seemed to infect every public performance in Scotland,&quot; using the name &quot;Bing Hitler&quot; borrowed from Peter Capaldi. Ferguson first performed as the character in Glasgow, and was subsequently a hit at the 1986 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. However, by the end of the year, Ferguson was already discussing his intention to retire Bing. At the press launch for an alternative pantomime of Sleeping Beauty (which he co-wrote with Capaldi), he said, &quot;You can&#x27;t write for just one character forever.&quot; A recording of his act as Bing Hitler was made at Glasgow&#x27;s Tron Theatre and released in the 1980s; a Bing Hitler monologue (&quot;A Lecture for Burns Night&quot;) appears on the compilation cassette &quot;Honey at the Core.&quot;

After enjoying success at the Edinburgh Festival, Ferguson appeared on television as &#x27;Confidence&#x27; in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, on STV&#x27;s &quot;Hogmanay Shows&quot;, and on the 1993 &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; Christmas special &quot;One Foot in the Algarve.&quot; In 1990, a pilot of &quot;The Craig Ferguson Show&quot;, a one-off comedy pilot for Granada Television, was broadcast, co-starring Paul Whitehouse and Helen Atkinson-Wood. In 1991, Channel 4 asked him to host &quot;Friday at the Dome&quot;, a 75-minute live music show. In 1992, he was given his own BBC Scotland show, &quot;2000 Not Out&quot;. In 1993, he presented a six-part archaeology TV series, &quot;The Dirt Detective&quot;, for STV, and was given a six-part TV series on BBC One, &quot;The Ferguson Theory,&quot; a mix of stand-up and sketches recorded the day before transmission.

Ferguson also found success in musical theatre. Beginning in 1991, he appeared on stage as Brad Majors in the London production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. In 1994, he played Father MacLean in production of &quot;Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom&quot; at the Union Chapel in London. That year he appeared again at the Edinburgh Fringe, as Oscar Madison in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;.

After living and working in the US for many years, in 2017, it was announced that he would return to UK television for the first time in 25 years in a guest role in BBC Scotland&#x27;s comedy &quot;Still Game,&quot; to be shown in 2018.

In 2022, an adaptation of Ferguson&#x27;s film &quot;Saving Grace&quot; (2000) was announced as a stage musical aimed for a 2023 run in West End, in which Ferguson will portray a &quot;villainous banker&quot;. It was adapted by April De Angelis from Ferguson&#x27;s and Mark Crowdy&#x27;s screenplay, with music by KT Tunstall.

===US career===
Ferguson moved to Los Angeles in November 1994, after his soon-to-be agent Rick Siegel had seen Ferguson during the Edinburgh Festival and suggested that he come to America. His first US role was as baker Logan McDonough on the short-lived 1995 ABC comedy &quot;Maybe This Time&quot;, which starred Betty White and Marie Osmond.

His breakthrough in the US came when he was cast on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; as the title character&#x27;s boss, Mr. Wick, a role he played from 1996 to 2003. He played the role with an over-the-top posh English accent, explaining it was &quot;to make up for generations of English actors doing crap Scottish accents.&quot; In his comedy special &quot;A Wee Bit o&#x27; Revolution&quot;, he specifically identified James Doohan&#x27;s portrayal of Montgomery Scott on &quot;Star Trek&quot; as the foundation of his &quot;revenge&quot;. (At the end of one episode, though, Ferguson broke the fourth wall and began talking to the audience at home in his regular Scottish accent.) His character was memorable for his unique methods of laying employees off, almost always &quot;firing Johnson&quot;, the most common last name of the to-be-fired workers. Even after leaving the show in 2003, he remained a recurring character on the series for the last two seasons, and was part of the two-part series finale in 2004.

During the production of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, Ferguson devoted his off-time as a cast member to writing, working in his trailer on set in between shooting his scenes. He wrote and starred in three films: &quot;The Big Tease&quot;, &quot;Saving Grace&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;; he also directed the latter, for which he won the Audience Award for Best Film at the Aspen, Dallas, and Valencia film festivals. He was named Best New Director at the Napa Valley Film Festival. These were among other scripts that, &quot;in the great tradition of the movie business, about half a dozen that I got paid a fortune for but never got made.&quot;

His other acting credits in films include &quot;Niagara Motel&quot;, &quot;Lenny the Wonder Dog&quot;, &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, &quot;Chain of Fools&quot;, &quot;Born Romantic&quot;, &quot;The Ugly Truth&quot;, &quot;Kick-Ass&quot;, and, as a voice-over actor, &quot;How to Train Your Dragon&quot;, &quot;How to Train Your Dragon 2&quot;, &quot;Brave&quot;, and &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;.

Ferguson has been touring the United States and Canada with a comedy show since the late 2000s, including a performance at Carnegie Hall on 23 October 2010 and a performance at Radio City Music Hall on 6 October 2012. He has performed two stand-up television specials on Comedy Central, both released on DVD: &quot;A Wee Bit o&#x27; Revolution&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Does This Need to Be Said?&quot; in 2011. His third comedy special, &quot;I&#x27;m Here to Help&quot;, was released on Netflix in 2013, garnering positive reviews of 4 out of 5 stars on Netflix and peaking at number 6 on Billboard top comedy albums. It also received a 2014 Grammy Award nomination for Best Comedy Album.

Ferguson was awarded the Peter Ustinov Comedy Award by the Banff World Media Festival on 11 June 2013.

====&quot;The Late Late Show&quot;====


In December 2004, it was announced that Ferguson would succeed Craig Kilborn on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. His first show as the regular host aired on 3 January 2005. The show was unique in that it had no &quot;human&quot; sidekicks such as Ed McMahon on &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot; or Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Andy Richter. Beginning in 2010, a robotic skeleton named Geoff Peterson and two silent performers in a pantomime horse costume were added to the show. His monologues were conducted within a few feet of the camera versus the long distance Johnny Carson kept from the camera and audience.

&quot;The Late Late Show&quot; averaged 2.0 million viewers in its 2007 season, compared with 2.5 million for &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. In April 2008, &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; beat &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; for weekly ratings (1.88 million to 1.77 million) for the first time since the two shows went head-to-head with their respective hosts.

In March 2009, Craig Ferguson topped Jimmy Fallon in the ratings with Ferguson getting a 1.8 rating and Fallon receiving a 1.6 rating. By 2014, Ferguson&#x27;s ratings had faltered, trailing those of &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot; with an average of 1.35 million viewers versus 2.02 million.

On 28 April 2014, Ferguson announced he would leave &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; at the end of 2014, with the final episode airing on 19 December. His contract was set to expire in June 2014, but a six-month extension was agreed on to provide a more graceful exit and give CBS more time to find a replacement host. He reportedly received as part of his contract because he was not selected as the replacement for David Letterman&#x27;s &quot;Late Show&quot;. Ferguson made the decision prior to Letterman&#x27;s announcement but agreed to delay making his own decision public until the reaction to Letterman&#x27;s decision (announced 3 April) had died down. CBS Entertainment Chair Nina Tassler said, following the announcement, that in his decade as host Ferguson had &quot;infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television.&quot; CBS continued the franchise with James Corden as the new host.

====Post–&quot;Late Late Show&quot;====
In October 2013, it was announced that Ferguson would host the syndicated game show &quot;Celebrity Name Game&quot;, produced by Coquette Productions, beginning in late 2014. Ferguson&#x27;s involvement in the project dates back to 2011, when it was originally pitched and piloted as a CBS primetime series. , the series had an initial order of 180 episodes. The syndicated series began airing on 22 September 2014. Ferguson won Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game Show Host for &quot;Celebrity Name Game&quot; in 2015 and 2016. On 2 December 2016, it was announced that the series would end after three seasons.

Ferguson signed in 2015 to play Prentiss Porter in &quot;The King of 7B&quot;, a comedy pilot for ABC. The show was not picked up.

On 18 February 2016, Ferguson began to host a historical talk show on History titled &quot;Join or Die with Craig Ferguson&quot;. The title is a reference to a Benjamin Franklin political cartoon published in the &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; on 9 May 1754, which Ferguson had tattooed on his forearm after becoming an American citizen. Ferguson and a three-guest panel of comedians and historians conduct a humorous discussion of a different topic on each episode, such as the most doomed presidential campaign, greatest Founding Father and greatest invention, with viewers invited to share their opinions via Twitter. 

Between January 2021 and April 2022, Ferguson hosted the American game show &quot;The Hustler&quot;, which aired on ABC. The show followed five contestants who collaborate to build up a cash prize by answering a series of trivia questions presented by Ferguson, while one of the contestants is secretly designated as the Hustler beforehand and given the answers to all the questions. By the end of the game, two of the honest contestants have been eliminated; the other two must correctly choose the Hustler in order to stop the Hustler from winning the entire prize. The series premiered on 4 January 2021, before moving to its regular timeslot on 7 January 2021, airing on Thursdays at 10 p.m. In April 2022, it was reported that the series was cancelled, having aired 19 episodes across two seasons.

<doc id="1254068" wikidata="Q6238377" url="?curid=1254068" title="Karl Ivan Westman">
<text>Karl Ivan Westman (5 August 1889 – 24 April 1970) was a Swedish diplomat who served as Sweden&#x27;s minister to Switzerland in Bern between 1928 and 1938 and at the League of Nations, in connection with the Continuation War Sweden&#x27;s minister to Helsinki between March 1941 and October 1942, and after World War II Sweden&#x27;s ambassador to Paris from 1947 to 1956.

Westman had, as the highly intelligent man he was, done a fast career in Sweden&#x27;s foreign ministry. His analyses of the host countries, and the power play at the League of Nations, were considered outstanding—a judgement that holds also in retrospect. The mission at the League of Nations was considered central to Sweden&#x27;s foreign policy during the interbellum; and when appointed to Helsinki, that was at a moment when it was considered the most crucial of Sweden&#x27;s embassies. For a diplomat, he was however also extraordinarily outspoken, often with a significant amount of sarcasm and unveiled criticism.

Karl Ivan Westman was the brother of Karl Gustaf Westman, Sweden&#x27;s Justice Minister during World War II.

==Finland and Operation Barbarossa==
In his youth, Westman had been involved in the Nationalist Activism movement, which provided him both with relevant contacts and a good understanding for contemporary thinking in independent Finland. But he was also critical of its political development, from the bloody aftermath of the Civil War and forth, and particularly suspicious against the fennoman school of thoughts that dominated outside of the Finland-Swedish circles, and what he perceived as their strong anti-Nordic undercurrent.

His outspoken opposition against the host country&#x27;s increasing cooperation with Nazi Germany, in the run up to and during the Continuation War, led to an unfortunate failure of his mission to Helsinki. His reports to Stockholm were factually correct, but he was unsuited to reestablish a Finnish feeling of trust for the Swedes after the trauma of the Winter War, and what in Finland was widely perceived as Sweden&#x27;s betrayal; and in Helsinki the suspicion grew that his reports were in fact unfavorable. Most crucially, he never came on speaking terms with Finland&#x27;s foreign minister Rolf Witting, despite their shared mother tongue. This contributed to the abortion of close intelligence cooperation between the two countries, and resulted among other things in a total failure for the Swedish attempts to improve the relations with the Third Reich be means of some kind of cooperation in Operation Barbarossa—executed as &quot;support for Finland&#x27;s heroic struggle against Bolshevism&quot;—at the same time intending to ease Finland&#x27;s emotional dependency on Germany.

Westman argued, not without some merit, that his views truly represented those of the Swedish government and civil service in general, and specifically the views of the cabinet. The realpolitik policies of Foreign Minister Günther were not as popular in the left-leaning majority of the Cabinet now, when a clash between Nazism and Communism was on the agenda, as it had been during the zenith of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. What he said in Helsinki, he was convinced, was totally in accordance with the views of influential Social Democrats as Östen Undén and Ernst Wigforss, and also with the generally neutralist Liberals and Agrarians.

After Finland&#x27;s re-conquest of Vyborg, that had been a key castle of the Swedish Empire from 1293–1721, a general display of flags was proclaimed for August 30. In an unprecedented move, Sweden&#x27;s embassy did not fly the flags, and soon Finland&#x27;s Foreign Minister requested his removal. It would however last yet a year, and require the request of President Ryti, until Westman was recalled to Stockholm and replaced by a less controversial diplomat.

Westman felt the recall from Helsinki to be a humiliating reprimand, for which some kind of compensation was to be expected. When Westman&#x27;s friend Östen Undén after the world war became Sweden&#x27;s foreign minister, Westman was promptly given the prestigious position as State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and soon one of the most prestigious embassies, that in Paris.

<text>Robert McCormick Adams Jr. (July 23, 1926 – January 27, 2018) was an American anthropologist and secretary of the Smithsonian Institution (1984–94). He worked in both the Near East and Mesoamerica. A long time professor of the University of Chicago, he was best known for his research in Iraq.

==Early life and education==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, he attended Francis W. Parker School and graduated in 1943. He received his doctorate from the University of Chicago (1957), where he was also employed as a member of the faculty. He was Director of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago (1962–68, 1981–83). He served as the provost of the University of Chicago (1982–84). He was an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego, at the time of his death.

==Secretary of the Smithsonian==

Adams served as the ninth secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., from 1984 to 1994. He was installed as Smithsonian Secretary on September 17, 1984, becoming the head of an Institution with thirteen museums, a National Zoo, and scientific and cultural research facilities in nine states and the Republic of Panama. As the successor to S. Dillon Ripley, Adams sought to prepare the Institution for the 21st century, focus on scholarship, increase public programs, and emphasize a broader representation and involvement of diverse ethnic and cultural communities in the Smithsonian and its programs. Adams oversaw construction of the Quadrangle, a building project that brought together two museums and many disparate offices into a single structure, but he also sounded the alarm to the US Congress about the state of the Institution&#x27;s aging infrastructure and began the systematic renovation of existing facilities. These &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; projects included renovation of the Freer Gallery of Art, the construction of the Mathias Laboratory at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, and the Earl S. Tupper Research and Conference Center at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama.

During Adams&#x27;s tenure, the Smithsonian acquired the National Museum of the American Indian, and the National Postal Museum was established to showcase the National Philatelic Collection. The National Science Resources Center was created to improve the teaching of pre-college science and mathematics, and the International Center was established to explore ancient and evolving cultures and to serve as the Smithsonian&#x27;s headquarters for Latin American scholarship, exhibitions, and programs. Adams formed the Smithsonian Cultural Education Committee to promote diversity across all aspects of Smithsonian operations. He also encouraged digitization projects, such as the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s videodisc technology for storage and retrieval of documents, photos, and other information. The &quot;culture wars&quot; arrived at the Smithsonian in 1991, with criticisms of The West as America, an exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. In 1994, Science in American Life, at the National Museum of American History, provoked outcries from the scientific community for its critical look at American science. And the first script for the Enola Gay exhibit in the National Air and Space Museum was completed shortly before Adams&#x27;s departure.

==Later life==

Adams retired from the Smithsonian after ten years of service in 1994 and returned to academia as an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego. He received a Distinguished Service Award from the Society for American Archaeology in 1996 and continued his fieldwork and research in the archaeology and anthropology of the Middle East.

==Scholarly research==
Robert McCormick Adams has had a wide-ranging career spanning many fields. Geographically, his interests have involved extensive fieldwork in the Middle East, but have also included Mexico. With a broadly interdisciplinary approach, he has studied the course of development of urban civilizations over many millennia, and he has also dealt with the history of technology. Partly as an outgrowth of decades of experience in Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia, he has until recently been involved in studies of multiethnic violence under the joint sponsorship of the US National Academy of Sciences and the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Over the course of his career Adams has emphasized the importance of social interaction and cultural ecology in the evolution of civilizations. His research has explored how cultural ecology can help explain the rise of civilizations and how cultures affect each other.

Adams has proposed, based on his excavations in Mesopotamia, that there was no single condition behind the complex societies of ancient cities and states; they were a product of numerous interrelated conditions, especially social organization and craft specialization. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957, a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1970, and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1974. In 1988, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Adams received the Gold Medal Award for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement in 2002 from the Archaeological Institute of America.

<text>Adam Afzelius (8 October 175020 January 1837) was a Swedish botanist and an apostle of Carl Linnaeus. Afzelius was born at Larv in Västergötland in 1750. He was appointed teacher of oriental languages at Uppsala University in 1777, and in 1785 demonstrator of botany. In 1793 he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1800, Adam Afzelius became member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

Between 1792 and 1796, as part of the Sierra Leone Company, he made two journeys to West Africa, where he reported on the geography, climate and natural resources of the region. While there, he also collected botanical specimens that were later acquired by Uppsala University.

In 1797–98, he acted as secretary of the Swedish embassy in London and on 19 April 1798, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. Returning to Sweden, he again took up his position as &quot;botanices demonstrator&quot; at Uppsala, and was in 1802 elected president of the &quot;Zoophytolithic Society&quot; (later called the Linnaean Institute). In 1812 he became professor of materia medica at the university. He died in Uppsala in 1837. In addition to various botanical writings, he published the autobiography of Carl Linnaeus in 1823.

His brother, Johan Afzelius (1753–1837), was professor of chemistry at Uppsala; and another brother, Pehr von Afzelius (1760–1843; the &quot;von&quot; was added when he was ennobled), who became a professor of medicine at Uppsala in 1801, was distinguished as a medical teacher and practitioner.

The botanical genus &quot;Afzelia&quot; (subfamily Caesalpinioideae) commemorates his name, and in 1857, the plant species &quot;Anubias afzelii&quot; was named after him by Heinrich Wilhelm Schott.

<doc id="1254087" wikidata="Q4353489" url="?curid=1254087" title="Karl Gustaf Westman">
<text>Karl Gustaf Westman (18 August 1876 – 24 January 1944) was a Swedish historian and political leader.

==Biography==
Westman attended Uppsala University, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1897, Licentiate of Philosophy in 1904 and a Ph.D. 1905. He was professor of the History of Law in the faculty of law at Uppsala University (1910–1941).

In political office, he represented the Agrarian &quot;Bondeförbundet&quot;, which was established in 1913. He was minister of education and ecclesiastical affairs (1914–1917). He served as foreign minister (1936), and justice minister (1936–1943). Although not the chairman of his party, Westman was without doubt his party&#x27;s most influential cabinet member.

As a justice minister, and as one of the cabinet members with a say in matters of foreign policy during World War II, Westman has been criticized for what some observers have perceived as exaggerated adaptation to Nazi Germany&#x27;s expected victory in the war, and for a limited respect for the freedom of the press to criticize foreign powers.

==Personal life==
Karl Gustaf Westman was the son of the postmaster Carl Johan Westman and Tonny (Andersson) Westman. He was the brother of the diplomat Karl Ivan Westman. He was married in 1935 to Margit Printz. Children: Ingun Margareta (born 1936), Sighild Margareta (born 1937) and Karl Joar (born 1939). Westman was buried on 2 February 1944 at Gamla kyrkogården in Uppsala.

==In popular culture==
In the Swedish television movie &quot;Four days that shook Sweden - The Midsummer Crisis 1941&quot;, from 1988, he is played by Swedish actor Allan Svensson.

<text>The Auckland teal (Anas aucklandica) (), also known as Auckland Islands teal, is a species of dabbling duck of the genus &quot;Anas&quot; that is endemic to Auckland Islands south of New Zealand. The species was once found throughout the Auckland Islands but is now restricted to the islands that lack introduced predators: Adams Island, Enderby Island, Disappointment Island and a few smaller islands. An old report of &quot;the same flightless duck&quot; on North East Island, The Snares group most likely refers to a straggler.

The Auckland teal is smaller and rarer than the brown teal of the main islands of New Zealand, a species with which it was once considered conspecific. The plumage is all over brown with a hint of green on the neck and a conspicuous white eyering. The female is slightly darker than the male. The wings are very small and the species has, like the related Campbell teal, lost the power of flight.

The Auckland teal is mostly crepuscular to nocturnal, preferring to hide from predators (New Zealand falcons and skuas) during the day. The species inhabits a variety of habitats with the islands, including tussock fields, mega herb shrubland and coastal waters. It is carnivorous for the most part, feeding on marine invertebrates, insects, amphipods and other small Invertebrates. Auckland teal are territorial and seldom form flocks.

<text>Whitman Blount Mayo Jr. (November 15, 1930 – May 22, 2001) was an American actor, best known for his role as Grady Wilson on the 1970s television sitcom &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Whitman Blount Mayo Jr. was born in New York City. He was raised in Harlem and later Queens. At the age of 17, he moved with his family to Southern California.

Mayo enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving from 1951 to 1953 during the Korean War.

Upon discharge, he studied at Chaffey College, Los Angeles City College, and UCLA.

===Career===

While attending college, Mayo began acting in small parts. He held many jobs to support himself and his family, including waiting tables, working in vineyards and as a probation officer. He also spent seven years as a counselor to delinquent boys.

In the early 1970s, while working for the New Lafayette Theatre, Norman Lear offered Mayo a role as Grady Wilson on &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;. The character&#x27;s name was based on Demond Wilson, the actor who played Lamont Sanford and whose real first name is Grady. During a period where Redd Foxx did not appear on the show due to a contract dispute, Grady moved into the Sanford house and effectively starred in the show for six episodes. Mayo later starred in &quot;Grady&quot;, an unsuccessful spin-off in which his character moved in with his daughter and her husband in Beverly Hills. After its cancellation in 1976, Mayo&#x27;s Grady character returned to &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;. Mayo reprised the role in the unsuccessful 1977 NBC-TV spinoff series &quot;Sanford Arms&quot; with actor Theodore Wilson, and for two episodes of &quot;Sanford&quot;, another spinoff of &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, this time with Redd Foxx and actor Dennis Burkley, in 1981.

Also in the late 1970s, Mayo appeared on the Los Angeles children&#x27;s television program &quot;That&#x27;s Cat&quot;, offering sage advice in a sweet manner to the main character Alice. In 1990, he appeared in an episode of &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; titled &quot;Hello in There&quot;. In 1991, he appeared in an episode of &quot;Full House&quot; titled &quot;The Volunteer&quot;; he played an old man named Eddie Johnson with Alzheimer&#x27;s. In 1996, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; spent several weeks trying to have Mayo appear on the show. Conan even went as far to set up the &quot;Grady Hotline&quot;, a 1–800 number where viewers could call in with any Grady &quot;sightings&quot;. The show also aired a mock episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;. On February 8, 1996, Mayo appeared on &quot;Late Night&quot; to much fanfare. In 1997, he guest-starred in the Nickelodeon sitcom &quot;Kenan and Kel,&quot; playing Kenan and Kyra&#x27;s rude, impatient Uncle Raymond.

Mayo also played a role in &quot;The Cape&quot; as Sweets, the owner of Moonshot Bar and Grill. Mayo made several film appearances, including &quot;The Main Event&quot; with Barbra Streisand, &quot;D.C. Cab&quot;, &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot;, and &quot;Waterproof&quot; with Burt Reynolds. Mayo also appeared as Reverend Banyon on the BET TV Movie &quot;Boycott&quot; in 2001 and in an episode of &quot;Martin&quot;. He hosted &quot;Liars and Legends&quot; on Turner South. He also made appearances in Sesame Street. Mayo taught drama at Clark Atlanta University. He opened a travel agency in Inglewood, California. Mr. Mayo was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.

===Personal life and death===
Mayo married Melva Washington, the daughter of Clarence and Lena Washington, in Los Angeles in 1956.

He resided in Atlanta&#x27;s Collier Heights community since 1994 with Gail Mayo, his third wife.

Mayo died of a heart attack on May 22, 2001, at Atlanta&#x27;s Grady Memorial Hospital. His son Rahn Mayo became a member of the Georgia House of Representatives in 2009.

<doc id="1254093" wikidata="Q61080" url="?curid=1254093" title="Hermann Prey">
<text>Hermann Prey ( Berlin, 11 July 1929 – Krailling, 22 July 1998) was a German lyric baritone, who was equally at home in the Lied, operatic and concert repertoires. His American debut was in November 1952, with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Eugene Ormandy, and his American recital debut took place in 1956, at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. As a Lieder singer, he was a gifted interpreter of Schubert, including his song-cycles &quot;Die schöne Müllerin&quot; and &quot;Die Winterreise&quot; and the collection of songs &quot;Schwanengesang&quot;, as well as of Robert Schumann, Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler. He also appeared frequently as a soloist in Bach&#x27;s &quot;Passions&quot; and Brahms&#x27; &quot;A German Requiem&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Hermann Prey was born in Berlin and grew up in Germany. He was scheduled to be drafted when World War II ended. He studied voice at the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin and won the prize of the Frankfurt contest of the Hessischer Rundfunk in 1952.

==Career==

===Repertoire and notable roles===
He began to sing in song recitals and made his operatic debut the next year with the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden in Bad Salzschlirf (Moruccio in Eugen d&#x27;Albert&#x27;s Tiefland). He joined Hamburg State Opera&#x27;s resident company, where he sang until 1960. During his last years in Hamburg, he also made frequent guest appearances elsewhere, including the Salzburg Festival.

He sang frequently at the Metropolitan Opera between 1960 and 1970 (and as late as the early 1990s), and made his Bayreuth debut in 1965 as Wolfram (Tannhäuser), returning there 1966–67, 1981–84 and 1986. Although he often sang Verdi early in his career, he later concentrated more on Mozart and Richard Strauss. Prey was well known for playing Figaro (Mozart and Rossini), but he played other Mozart roles at least equally often, particularly Papageno and Guglielmo. He also played, and recorded, the Count in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, and occasionally performed as Don Giovanni. He is regarded by some as the best Eisenstein (from Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss II) ever.

He was at home with comic opera Italian-style, displaying scenic intelligence, liveliness and hilarity. His virtuoso agility and great comic acting made him an obvious choice for numerous productions of Mozart&#x27;s and Rossini&#x27;s operas in the 1970s. In 1972 he performed as Figaro in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle&#x27;s television film of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Il Barbiere di Siviglia&quot; with Teresa Berganza as Rosina, Luigi Alva as Almaviva and conductor Claudio Abbado. He appeared alongside Fritz Wunderlich and Hans Hotter in the live televised version of &quot;Il Barbiere di Siviglia&quot; in its German translation, &quot;Der Barbier von Sevilla&quot;. He also portrayed Figaro in 1976 in Ponnelle&#x27;s film of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;.

In 1976, Hermann Prey organised the first Schubertiade Vorarlberg in Hohenems, Vorarlberg. A Schubertiade is an event dedicated to the life and works of the Austrian composer Franz Schubert. On May 8, 1976, the first Schubertiade Vorarlberg evening begins with a recital by Hermann Prey, with Leonard Hokanson on the piano.

Prey also sang operetta and performed on German television, becoming extremely popular with television audiences. He shared media-celebrity with Fritz Wunderlich until the latter&#x27;s early death, often playing Papageno to Wunderlich&#x27;s Tamino.
Unlike Fischer-Dieskau, Prey limited his Wagner to the soft, high-baritone roles Wolfram and Beckmesser. He can be seen on video in the latter role, opposite Bernd Weikl.

In 1988, he directed a production of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; in Salzburg. 

===Voice===
Prey possessed a clear, polished tone—darker and deeper-sounding than his slightly older contemporary Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, but equally refined and equally capable of soaring into the tenor range without the smallest suggestion of vocal effort.

===Recordings===
He recorded a multi-volume set for Phillips, tracing the history of the &quot;Lied&quot; from the Minnesänger to the twentieth century. In addition, he released numerous recordings of opera and song.

===As a teacher and writer===
Starting in 1982, he taught at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg, and he wrote an autobiography which was translated as &quot;First Night Fever: The Memoirs of Hermann Prey&quot; ().

===Collaborative Pianists===
Pianists who collaborated with Hermann Prey in recitals and/or recordings of Lied repertoire include Karl Engel, Gerald Moore, Wolfgang Sawallisch, Leonard Hokanson, Helmut Deutsch, Friedrich Gulda, Jörg Demus, Walter Klien and Michael Endres. Florian Uhlig played for one of his last recordings of September 1997 at Herbstliche Musiktage Bad Urach.

==Death==
He died in Krailling, Bavaria, of a heart attack on July 22, 1998, at the age of 69.

==Family==
His son Florian is also a baritone.

<doc id="1254096" wikidata="Q1049352" url="?curid=1254096" title="Social security in Sweden">
<text>Social security in Sweden is an aspect of the Swedish welfare system and consists of various social insurances handled by the National Agency for Social Insurance (), and welfare provided based on need by local municipalities. Social security is the main conduit for redistribution of approximately 20% of the Swedish GDP mainly in the form of income taxes, Payroll taxes and Value added taxes.

== Family policy ==

Family policy for Swedish social security has undertaken a series of reforms. Initially, the policy aimed to encourage Swedish youth to marry and build families. The whole family policy consists of three parts: parental benefits, child allowance and public daycare. 

=== Parental benefit ===
Families receive up to a maximum of 480 days (16 months) paid parental leave, , with an optional additional three months unpaid leave, and ten days of leave after the birth of a child for fathers. Regulations require each parent to take at least two months leave, but in reality, some fathers do not take leave at all. In this case the policy is implemented on a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; basis and the parental leave time will drop from 16 months to 14 months if unused by one parent. The leave can be used intermittently and for parts of days, but must be expended before the child is eight years of age. Parents are paid an approximate 80% of their pay for the first 390 days, and in the remaining 90 days, receive a flat rate of SEK 180 per day. The rate for unemployed parents is SEK 180 per day for the entirety of their parental leave. 

Parents receive up to a maximum of 120 days (four months) of leave to take care of sick children every year, in addition to a childcare allowance, &quot;,&quot; to enable parents to stay at home and care for children with long-term illnesses.

Parental leave in Sweden is job-protected, meaning parents who take the leave have the right to return to the same employer and into the same or an adequate similar position.

Apart from paid leave, parents also receive a whole or partial reimbursement for hospital care, treatment and transportation related to childbirth.

=== Child allowance ===
The child allowance in Sweden started from the General Child Allowance in 1948. Parents in Sweden receive cash benefits to ease the burden of raising children who are under 16 years old, &quot;.&quot; Generally, Swedish parents receive a flat rate child allowance of SEK 1050 per month for one child, which is tax-exempt. If the family have more than one child qualifying for the child allowance, the family receive SEK 1050 more per child with additional &quot;large family supplement&quot; or &quot;.&quot; For example, a family with four children under sixteen years of age will receive SEK 4200 child allowance and SEK 1614 large family supplement per month, totaling SEK 5814 per month. This child allowance is financed by the central government&#x27;s budget and parents do not need to apply for the allowance; it is paid automatically.

Apart from the child allowance, there are other allowances available for families with children. Families with children that pay over SEK 1400 for housing per month will receive a state-rent housing allowance, the level of which is determined by the number of children, the income of the family and the size and rent of the housing. But the income ceiling is set rather high, so that even a family with income well above average is entitled to receive house allowance.

For families with disabled children, they will also receive allowance for car, care and hiring personal assistants.

=== Public day care ===
Public day care in Sweden are for children under seven years old. The daycare centers are run by local municipalities under the guidance of central government. Most municipal preschools are open ten to twelve hours a day to take care of children whose parents work full-time; there are also nighttime daycare centers for parents who work at night. &quot;After the parents apply for placement at a preschool in the municipality where they live, the child is offered a vacancy based on that municipality&#x27;s queue and admission rules.&quot; The reform in 2007 made daycare more affordable; EU/EEA citizens only need to pay a reduced fee for a full-time preschool.

Apart from public daycare, there are also cooperatives run by parents, private child care facilities and family daycare; minders are hired by local municipalities to take care of children in their house. However, public daycare is absolutely the majority. During 1965–1980, the number of child care facilities increased tenfold. Today, over three-quarters of children aged one to five go to publicly supported daycare centers.

== Housing allowance ==

Families with children and people below 29 years of age may be eligible to receive a housing allowance, . The amount depends on income, the size of the family, housing costs and house size. At most it is 1,300 SEK.

== Benefits for ill and disabled ==

Working people are entitled to sick pay when ill. The first 14 days (except the first day off) are paid by the employer, the rest by Försäkringskassan. If an employee&#x27;s ability to work is permanently reduced, disability payments may be made.

If an employee needs time-consuming assistance in everyday life to be able to work or study due to illness or disability, disability allowance or can be obtained.
If a person has a substantial and permanent disability and needs assistance with mealtimes, washing, clothing and communicating with others, an allowance, , can be provided to pay for an assistant. If a person has great difficulties in getting about on their own, or in using public transport due to a permanent disability, they can obtain an allowance to purchase a car, make alterations to a car, and to get a driving licence.

== Support for the elderly ==

If an employee has worked in Sweden and earned a taxable work income, they will be entitled to Swedish old age pension, at the earliest age of 61 years. The levels depend on income and how long the employee has worked. There is also a guarantee pension which one is entitled to if they have lived for at least three years in Sweden if they have had no or low income. The elderly can also receive housing supplements or maintenance support. The levels of these depend on one&#x27;s needs.

== Welfare ==

If a person has no or low income, they can apply for welfare from the local municipality. The municipality will evaluate their economic situation to determine if they should receive welfare or not. The welfare should be enough to cover things like housing, food, clothing and telephone.

<doc id="1254099" wikidata="Q5216941" url="?curid=1254099" title="Daniel de Bourg">
<text>Daniel de Bourg ( ; born 13 April 1976) is a British singer, songwriter, and actor.

==Early life and influences==
Originally from Chelmsford, Essex, England. By the time de Bourg was eleven, he was offered a full scholarship to study at the Royal Ballet School after being spotted by talent scouts, and graduating at the top of his class with his final solo performance. Although dance was his primary interest, as a teen he was also fronting bands. He left school when given the opportunity to dance for the Rambert Dance Company, performing as a featured dancer all over the world. It was at the suggestion of a friend that heard him singing that de Bourg found himself in the position for a career in music.

==Music career==
Influenced by artists such as Prince and Stevie Wonder, de Bourg did not take to a singing career straight away. Dedicated to dance, de Bourg&#x27;s early interest in singing was rediscovered after a knee injury caused some time out from his dance career. de Bourg turned his hand to songwriting; recorded by singer Jamelia in 2000, his song &quot;Money&quot; reached number 5 on the UK Singles Chart. Remembering de Bourg&#x27;s musical talents, he was encouraged by a friend to create several demos of his own singing. These attracted the interest of DreamWorks scout Robbie Robertson. de Bourg was introduced to then in-house producers Tim &amp; Bob and subsequently signed to the label and the duo produced his debut album, &quot;Tell the World&quot;. The high-production album, released in 2002, launched the single &quot;I Need an Angel&quot;, which hit number 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart.

In 2008, UK artist DJ Ironik presented de Bourg on his album, &quot;No Point in Wasting Tears&quot;.

In 2010, &quot;The DDB Mixtape Vol. 1: The Prelude&quot;, a mixture of de Bourg&#x27;s most popular covers and original material, received a nomination for &#x27;Best R&amp;B Mixtape 2010&#x27; and went on to win the award at The Official Mixtape Awards in early 2011. He went on to win the same accolade another two years in a row with &#x27;The DDB Mixtape Vol. 2 : The Bridge&#x27; in 2011 and &#x27;Outro&#x27; in 2012.

In 2013, Daniel released his album, &quot;London Bread&quot;. featuring production from Drake and Lil Wayne hit maker, Boi-1da. The album hit the top 20 on iTunes in 21 countries in its first week of release.

His YouTube channel, that envelops a mix of his cover songs has grown to over 260,000 subscribers and close to 50 million views. 

==Acting career==
In 2015, de Bourg signed with a TV, film and stage agent in London, and was cast in the Broadway transfer of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot; that opens at the Prince Edward Theatre in the West End in London, in 2016. He went on to play the principle role of Kassim from 2017 - 2019.

In 2020 de Bourg was cast in the original cast in the West End of Pretty Woman the Musical at The Piccadilly Theatre covering both the leading role as Edward and the supporting lead role as Stucky.

Daniel then moved into screen acting and was cast by Donald Glover in his US series &#x27;Atlanta&#x27; in early 2021, appearing in the 3rd series as a poker-playing German millionaire, Yonathan.

Daniel was then cast by Hollywood director Martin Campbell (Casino Royale, Golden Eye, The Mask of Zoro, James Bond) in his new action thriller, &#x27;Memory&#x27; starring Liam Neeson, Guy Pearce and Monica Bellucci. De Bourg stars as cut-throat lawyer Willam Borden. 

De Bourg has been filming in Morocco with October Films for their new TV series &quot;Colosseum&quot; in the lead role of &quot;Haterius&quot; and features in season 2 of &quot;Whitstable Pearl&quot; as troubled pilot &quot;Noah&quot;.

Roles in SKY series &#x27;COBRA&#x27;, short films &#x27;TICKET&#x27; and &#x27;JUST PASSING&#x27; followed and are scheduled for release in 2023.

<text>Handy Dan Home Improvement was an American home improvement store founded by Amnon Barness, an Israeli immigrant. It went out of business in May, 1989. 

By 1972, the company operated 30 stores in California, Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma. It made an initial offering in November, which led to Daylin, Inc. owning 81% of Handy Dan. Daylin filed for bankruptcy in February 1975, though its subsidiaries were not included in the Chapter 11 proceedings. Handy Dan was one of the few assets the company didn&#x27;t sell during this time.

Bernard Marcus was CEO of Handy Dan in 1978 when he was fired along with company vice president Arthur Blank amid a corporate power struggle with Daylin CEO Sanford C. Sigoloff. Marcus and Blank went on to found Home Depot. 

Daylin was purchased by W. R. Grace and Company in 1979. In 1986, Grace&#x27;s retail home improvement division, which included Handy Dan and Channel Home Centers, was sold to the division&#x27;s executives through a leveraged buyout. 

Handy Dan played a major role in getting Texas&#x27;s religion-based blue laws repealed in 1984 by opening on Sunday and using white price stickers for goods that could be sold seven days a week, and blue price stickers for items that could not be sold on Sunday.

<doc id="1254108" wikidata="Q450331" url="?curid=1254108" title="Cathleen Synge Morawetz">
<text>Cathleen Synge Morawetz (May 5, 1923 – August 8, 2017) was a Canadian mathematician who spent much of her career in the United States. Morawetz&#x27;s research was mainly in the study of the partial differential equations governing fluid flow, particularly those of mixed type occurring in transonic flow. She was professor emerita at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at the New York University, where she had also served as director from 1984 to 1988. She was president of the American Mathematical Society from 1995 to 1996. She was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1998.

==Childhood==
Morawetz&#x27;s father, John Lighton Synge, nephew of John Millington Synge, was an Irish mathematician, specializing in the geometry of general relativity. Her mother also studied mathematics for a time. Her uncle was Edward Hutchinson Synge who is credited as the inventor of the Near-field scanning optical microscope and very large astronomical telescopes, based on multiple mirrors.

Her childhood was split between Ireland and Canada. Both her parents were supportive of her interest in mathematics and science, and it was a woman mathematician, Cecilia Krieger, who had been a family friend for many years and later encouraged Morawetz to pursue a PhD in mathematics. Morawetz said her father was influential in stimulating her interest in mathematics, but he wondered whether her studying mathematics would be wise (suggesting they might fight like the Bernoulli brothers).

==Education==
A 1945 graduate of the University of Toronto, she married Herbert Morawetz, a chemist, on October 28, 1945. She received her master&#x27;s degree in 1946 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Morawetz got a job at New York University where she edited &quot;Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves&quot; by Richard Courant and Kurt Otto Friedrichs. She earned her Ph.D. in 1951 at New York University, with a thesis on the stability of a spherical implosion, under the supervision of Kurt Otto Friedrichs. Her thesis was entitled &quot;Contracting Spherical Shocks Treated by a Perturbation Method&quot;

==Career==
After earning her doctorate, she spent a year as a research associate at MIT before returning to work as a research associate at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU, for five more years. During this time she had no teaching requirements and could focus purely on research. She published work on a variety of topics in applied mathematics including viscosity, compressible fluids and transonic flows. Even if an aircraft remains subsonic, the air flowing around the wing can reach supersonic velocity. The mix of air at supersonic and subsonic velocity creates shock waves that can slow the airplane.

Turning to the mathematics of transonic flow, she showed that specially designed shockless airfoils could not, in fact, prevent shocks. Shocks developed in response to even small perturbations, such as a gust of wind or an imperfection in a wing. This discovery opened up the problem of developing a theory for a flow with shocks. Subsequently, the shocks she predicted mathematically now have been observed in experiments as air flows around the wing of a plane.

In 1957 she became an assistant professor at Courant. At this point she began to work more closely with her colleagues publishing important joint papers with Peter Lax and Ralph Phillips on the decay of solutions to the wave equation around a star shaped obstacle. She continued with important solo work on the wave equation and transonic flow around a profile until she was promoted to full professor by 1965.

At this point her research expanded to a variety of problems including papers on the Tricomi equation the nonrelativistic wave equation including questions of decay and scattering. Her first doctoral student, Lesley Sibner, was graduated in 1964. In the 1970s she worked on questions of scattering theory and the nonlinear wave equation. She proved what is now known as the Morawetz Inequality. She died on August 8, 2017, in New York City.

==Honors==
In 1980, Morawetz won a Lester R. Ford Award. In 1981, she became the first woman to deliver the Gibbs Lecture of The American Mathematical Society, and in 1982 presented an Invited Address at a meeting of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. She received honorary degrees from Eastern Michigan University in 1980, Brown University, and Smith College in 1982, and Princeton in 1990. In 1983 and in 1988, she was selected as a Noether Lecturer. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1984. She was named Outstanding Woman Scientist for 1993 by the Association for Women in Science. In 1995, she became the second woman elected to the office of president of the American Mathematical Society. 

In 1996, she was awarded an honorary ScD degree by Trinity College Dublin, where her father JL Synge had been a student and later a faculty member. That same year, she was elected to the American Philosophical Society. In 1998 she was awarded the National Medal of Science; she was the first woman to receive the medal for work in mathematics. In 2004, she received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Lifetime Achievement. In 2006, she won the George David Birkhoff Prize in Applied Mathematics. In 2012, she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

Morawetz was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and was the first woman to belong to the Applied Mathematics Section of that organization.

==Personal life==
Morawetz lived in Greenwich Village with her husband Herbert Morawetz, a polymer chemist. They had four children, eight grandchildren, and three great grandchildren. Their children are Pegeen Rubinstein, John, Lida Jeck, and Nancy Morawetz (a professor at New York University School of Law who manages its Immigrant Rights Clinic).

Upon being honored by the National Organization for Women for successfully combining career and family, Morawetz quipped, &quot;Maybe I became a mathematician because I was so crummy at housework.&quot; She said her current non-mathematical interests are &quot;grandchildren and sailing.&quot;

<doc id="1254114" wikidata="Q43334" url="?curid=1254114" title="John Pritchard (conductor)">
<text>Sir John Michael Pritchard, (born Stanley Frederick Pritchard, 5 February 1921 – 5 December 1989) was an English conductor. He was known for his interpretations of Mozart operas and for his support of contemporary music.

==Life and career==
Pritchard was born in Walthamstow, Essex, to a musical family. His father, Albert Edward Pritchard, was a violinist with the London Symphony Orchestra. The young Pritchard was educated at the Monoux School and studied violin, piano, and conducting in Italy.

Pritchard, as a conscientious objector, refused to serve in the Second World War, but was in any case unfit on medical grounds. In 1943 he took over the semi-professional Derby String Orchestra and was its principal conductor until 1951. He joined the music staff of Glyndebourne Festival Opera in 1947 and was appointed chorus master in 1949. He remained associated with Glyndebourne for most of his career, as conductor, music counsellor (from 1963), principal conductor (1968) and musical director (1969–1978).

Beyond Glyndebourne, Pritchard appeared with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, at Edinburgh in 1952 (deputising for Ernest Ansermet, who was ill). He made his début at the Royal Opera House in 1951 and at the Vienna State Opera in 1952. He appeared regularly with the Vienna Symphony (1953–1955).

For Glyndebourne in this period, Pritchard conducted Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; at the Edinburgh festivals of 1953 and 1954 and Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; at the Berlin Festival.

In 1957, Pritchard was appointed principal conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, where he launched the Musica Viva series showcasing contemporary music. His success in Liverpool led to his appointment as principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1962–1966). Freelancing after leaving the LPO, he conducted concerts in Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, Philadelphia and the Far East, and opera in Buenos Aires, Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Salzburg, Florence, and Munich. In 1973, he conducted the LPO in China, the first visit to China by a British orchestra.

Pritchard became chief guest conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1978, and subsequently served as its chief conductor from 1982 to 1989, the first BBC SO chief guest conductor to become its chief conductor. In this capacity, he conducted his first and only Last Night of the Proms in 1989, the year of his death. He served as &quot;Generalmusikdirektor&quot; of the Cologne Opera (1978–1989) and music director of La Monnaie (1981). He was the first titled music director of the San Francisco Opera, from 1986 until his death in 1989. At the time of his death, he was preparing Wagner&#x27;s Ring cycle for San Francisco.

Pritchard was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1962 and knighted in 1983. The prestigious Shakespeare Prize was awarded him in 1975 by the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation.

Pritchard died in 1989 in Daly City, California, with lung cancer as the reported cause of death. His partner, Terrence MacInnes, survived him.

==Repertoire==
Pritchard was a champion of a wide range of new music, conducting the premieres of Britten&#x27;s &quot;Gloriana&quot; and Tippett&#x27;s &quot;The Midsummer Marriage&quot; and &quot;King Priam,&quot; all at Covent Garden, and the British première of Henze&#x27;s &quot;Elegy for Young Lovers&quot; at Glyndebourne. Of the classics of the repertoire he was noted for his Mozart and Richard Strauss. His recordings include &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;, &quot;Falstaff&quot;, &quot;Macbeth,&quot; &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; (with Plácido Domingo), &quot;Il segreto di Susanna&quot; (with Renata Scotto and Renato Bruson), &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; and &quot;La traviata&quot; (the last two with Joan Sutherland).

<text>Vasastan, or formally Vasastaden, (Swedish for &quot;Vasa town&quot;) is a 3.00 km2 large city district in central Stockholm, Sweden, being a part of Norrmalm borough.

The major parks in Vasastaden are Vasaparken and Observatorielunden near the centre and Vanadislunden and Bellevueparken in the north.

== History ==

=== Vasastaden proper ===

The city district, most likely named after the street Vasagatan, in its turn named after King Gustav Vasa in 1885, was still a peripheral part of the city in the early 1880s. Before the end of that decade, however, some 150 buildings had been built and only the properties along Odengatan remained vacant. The expansion was preceded by a city plan established in 1879, a slightly more modest edition of the 1866 intentions of city planner Albert Lindhagen, in its turn largely a continuation north of an original 17th-century plan. Like the Baroque plan, the new plan took little or no account of local topographic variations, and where the two failed to reconcile, sites were simply set aside as parks or for major structures such as the Sabbatsberg Hospital.

Compared to central Stockholm, streets were widened to 18 metres, except for the main east-west-bound street Odengatan which was made 30 metres wide and adorned with plantings after continental prototypes. In accordance with construction charters from the 1870s, building corners where filleted and building heights adopted to street width and limited to five floors — embellishing proportions intended to bring light and air into the urban space. The Neo-Renaissance plaster architecture of the middle class residential buildings in southern Vasastaden is highly reminiscent of the Ringstraße in Vienna; the ground floors are dominated by horizontal elements with columns and pilasters above, while accentuated cornices closes the vertical compositions. Later architects failed to appreciate these Neo-Renaissance buildings and freed many of them of most of their decorations.

=== Sibirien ===

The north-eastern part of the district is called &quot;Sibirien&quot; (Siberia in English). The area borders Östermalm but has historically been a stronghold for the working class.

The origin of the name Sibirien (Eng. Siberia) originates from a time when the area was inhabited by the poor, who could not afford heating. People started to say that the area was &quot;as cold and as far away as Siberia&quot;, hence the nickname.

=== Birkastaden ===

In the north-western corner of the district are eight blocks forming Birkastaden, named after the 9th century settlement Birka, sometimes called Rörstrandsområdet (the &quot;Rörstrand Area&quot;) which forms the compact northern frontier of Stockholm&#x27;s historical city centre. As described above, Lindhagen&#x27;s original intentions for the elevated area was to keep it as a park featuring the 17th century avenue of Karlberg Palace. In the city plan of 1879, however, the area was divided into two large blocks, which were split up into smaller properties in 1886, on a request from the local landowner, porcelain factory Rörstrand. This resulted in a new city plan which was adopted to local topographic variations and therefore features non-perpendicular street crossings.

Few buildings were constructed before the start of the 20th century, but construction work soon boomed to culminate in 1905–06, speculation causing many buildings to change owners several times before their completion. Virtually all the buildings in Birkastaden are Art Nouveau, a result of both the brief construction period and the fact that some 50 buildings were designed by architects Dorph &amp; Höög, at the time the largest architectural practice in Northern Europe. The buildings of Birkastan feature oriel windows, towers on the corners, rounded pediments and bright and plain plaster façades with thrifty decorations. As a result of speculation, the backyards are narrow, and many flats shadowy. From the start, however, Birkastan was a mixed area shared by both low and high income earners.

=== Röda bergen ===
Röda bergen (&quot;Red Mountains&quot;), the hilly area just north of Birkastan, was unsuitable for the regular and perpendicular street pattern envisaged for Vasastaden, but proved excellent for the new city planning ideals where the terrain was allowed to govern city plans. The plan for Röda Bergen was designed by P O Hallman, who during the 1910s also produced similar plans for Lärkstaden inspired by the ideas of Austrian architect Camillo Sitte. His plan for Röda Bergen was adopted in 1909, but because of World War I most of these plans remained unrealised until the 1920s. In 1923 the plan, slightly modified by Sigurd Lewerentz, was finally established.

The buildings facing the surrounding blocks are traditional 5–6 floors residential buildings forming a wall around Röda Bergen. From the monumental eastern entrance, an avenue (Rödabergsgatan) leads west to a round elevated space where a church was originally planned. Perpendicular to this avenue, the heavily trafficked Torsgatan cuts through the area. The blocks within Röda Bergen are limited to 2–3 floors and most of the backyards are open in one end, which allows for plenty of sun light and series of spaces appealing to the eye. Hallman&#x27;s design was a sharp break with the contemporary narrow, dark, and often filthy backyards. In contrast to them, the involved architects — including Björn Hedwall, Paul Hedqvist, and Sven Wallander — carefully detailed the façades and gables facing the interior with simple classical ornaments and warm red and yellow colours. Of the 2.500 flats in the area, many included novelties such as warm and cold water, WC, and even bath tubes, but most of them were small — half of them was a single room with a kitchen or even less.

=== Atlas ===
The area next to the Sankt Eriksbron bridge was until the turn of century 1900 a heavily industrial district. The Atlas Area, east of the bridge and named after industrial company Atlas AB whose workshops used to occupy the area, presents features unique to Stockholm. The plan for the area was passed in 1926 and construction works immediately followed. In contrast to the newly built Röda Bergen, much of which was built by HSB, the builders at Atlas were private entrepreneurs. While this resulted in a much criticized high exploitation, the city building committee in 1926 concluded the area could boast an intelligible order and a regularity the neighbouring Rörstrand Area still couldn&#x27;t present notwithstanding recent redesign attempts.

The most striking feature of Atlas is the level difference between the surrounding streets and the area itself. Like at Röda Bergen, the buildings delimiting Atlas form a coherent wall where the exterior façades are six floors tall while the interior façades are nine floors tall. The buildings inside the area are 5–6 floors, concealing the dark narrow backyards while separated by widened streets with plantations. The difference in level was solved by mean of monumental flights of stairs resulting in the tall porticoes leading into the area.

The flats in Atlas were small — 1–2 rooms and a kitchen — and dark — a result of exploitation and the wide building volumes — but featured modernities such as central heating and bathrooms. The reduced classical ornamentation and the perpendicular plan has, however, given the area a monumentality which is characteristic for the National Romantic Swedish architecture of the 1920s. The contrast between the heavily trafficked surroundings streets and the calm interior of Atlas, brilliantly exposed through the large porticoes, still makes Atlas a popular area.

<text>Laverton, originally known as British Flag, is a town in the Goldfields region of Western Australia, and the centre of administration for the Shire of Laverton. The town of Laverton is located at the western edge of the Great Victoria Desert, north-northeast of the state capital, Perth, and east-northeast of the town of Leonora, with an elevation of .

About 20% of the population is of Aboriginal descent. The area is semi-arid, with a mean annual rainfall of . It is also quite warm, with mean daily maximum temperatures ranging from 17 °C (62 °F) in July to 36 °C (97 °F) in January.

Laverton is the westernmost town on the Outback Waya proposed highway which goes through the Northern Territory to Winton in outback Queensland.

==History==
A number of early explorers travelled over the Laverton area, including John Forrest, David Carnegie and Frank Hann. Gold was discovered in the British Flag area in 1896 and many prospectors and miners moved into the area. Among them was Dr Charles W. Laver, who became an enthusiastic supporter and promoter of the region.

One of the most successful mines was Craiggiemore, and by 1897 a residential and business area known as British Flag had sprung up on the west side of the mine. In March 1898 a townsite was approved as Laverton, in honour of Laver. In 1899, the residents sought to have a townsite surveyed, but by then the original Craiggiemore location had become unsuitable, so a new site was chosen about north of the original lots. The new site was surveyed in July 1899 and the town of Laverton gazetted in July 1900.

Laverton was the terminus of a branch line of the Kalgoorlie to Leonora railway line, with the junction at Malcolm.

By the late 1960s, Laverton was in decline, mainly because of the very low price of gold. In 1968 a Poseidon prospector Ken Shirley discovered nickel-bearing rocks at Windarra, northwest of Laverton. In 1969 Poseidon began drilling Windarra. In September rumours of a nickel strike prompted the Poseidon bubble. The deposit was developed by Western Mining and its partners into the Windarra Nickel Project, which mined and processed nickel ore from 1974 to 1991.

==Modern industry==

Laverton is primarily a mining area. There are two major operating gold mines in the district: the Wallaby Mine near Granny Smith, owned and operated by Gold Fields, and the Sunrise Dam Gold Mine, owned and operated by AngloGold Ashanti. Both open pit and underground mining is conducted at these mines. The Murrin Murrin laterite nickel project is located to the west, midway between Laverton and Leonora. The area has a long history of pastoralism with sheep, cattle and goats, and a substantial area of land is used in this way.

==Demographics==
According to census results from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the population of the Laverton urban centre fell 23%, from 439 to 340 in the 15 years from 2001 to 2016. Over this same period, the population of Indigenous Australians decreased from 37.6% (165 people) to 20.8% (71 people) of the town.

==Climate==
Laverton has a borderline hot arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;)/hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), with sweltering summers and pleasant winters. Rainfall is low throughout the year, typically coming from strong southern frontal systems in early winter or remnant tropical cyclones from the Pilbara in late summer. Since records started in 1899, the wettest calendar year has been 2000 with , and the driest 1928 with . The wettest month has been February 1995 with , and the wettest day 17 February 2011 with .

<text>The Jagdterrier ( ) (English: Hunting Terrier) is a type of working terrier, originating in Germany, that is used for hunting quarry both above and underground. This breed of terrier is also called the German Hunt Terrier.

==Description==

===Appearance===

A typical appearance of a Jagdterrier is black and tan, with the tan being more of a rust colour on the muzzle and undercarriage. It can also be chocolate or liver brown with white markings although the white markings and the chocolate colouring should be avoided in breeding programs along with a brown nose. Black and tan/rust markings should be the goal. The breed standard calls for an animal that stands at the shoulders, with females weighing from , and males weighing from . The coat of a Jagdterrier can be either hairy, smooth or broken. All varieties do shed. The tail is normally (but not always) docked at 2/3 the natural length.

===Temperament===

Jagdterriers were developed to be all-round hunting dogs. Though often used for quarry that dens underground, especially badger, fox, and raccoon, Jagdterriers are also used to drive wild boar and rabbits out of thickets, and to blood track wounded animals, such as deer. Due to their intelligence and adaptability, Jagdterriers can make good pets, but it should be remembered that they are primarily a hunting dog with a strong prey drive.

==History==
Between the two World Wars, game managers in Germany were focused on getting rid of foreign or introduced species, and bringing back now-extinct species that figured prominently in the mythology of the nation. One of the pioneers of this peculiar quest was Lutz Heck, the curator of the Berlin Zoo, who went on to &quot;back breed&quot; primitive cattle and horses to &quot;recreate&quot; the extinct aurochs (the kind of wild cattle seen in the cave paintings at Lascaux, France) and the tarpan (a kind of primitive forest pony). Heck&#x27;s interest in dogs was driven in part by his passion for hunting, and in part by nationalism that was mixed with a desire to see what could be done with selective breeding.

Even as nationalism and an interest in genetic engineering were rising in Germany, terriers were also rising to the height of fashion in much of Europe and the United States. The Allied Terrier Show was taken over by Charles Crufts in 1886, and was the largest dog show in the world before World War I, while the first breed-specific dog publication anywhere was a magazine devoted to fox terriers. The Westminster Dog Show was begun in 1907, and the first winner was a fox terrier. A fox terrier won again in 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1915, 1916, and 1917.

A fascination with terriers, fervent nationalism, and a propensity towards genetic engineering were braided together when Lutz Heck presented four black-and-tan Fell terriers—similar to what we now would call a Patterdale Terrier—to Carl Eric Gruenewald and Walter Zangenbert. Gruenewald was a &quot;cynologist&quot; (a self-styled dog man with an interest in genetics) and Zangenbert was a dedicated hunter with an interest in fox terriers. Gruenewald and Zangenbert added to their team Chief Forester R. Fiess and Dr. Herbert Lackner, men with land for a kennel, and the financial means to support it over a decade-long quest.

An early problem was that the Black and Tan Terriers selected as the core breeding stock and deemed &quot;ideal hunters&quot; based on colour alone were, in fact, not all that great at hunting. As Gruenewald later wrote:

:&quot;We were glad to own fox terriers with the hunting color, and we hoped to use these four puppies successfully in breeding to establish a hunting fox terrier breed (jagdfoxterrier-stamm). From the viewpoint of hunting these four dogs were not bad, although they left much to desire. First we tried inbreeding, pairing brothers with sisters. But the results were not good. No wonder -- after all, the parents weren&#x27;t real hunting dogs. The picture changed, though, when we bred our four &#x27;originals&#x27; with our well-trained old hunting fox terriers. The beautiful dark color continued to be dominate. Dogs with a lot of the white color and spotted dogs were selected and eliminated from further breeding.&quot;

The breeding program for the Jagdterrier was massive in scale and unwavering in its selection criteria. At one point the men had 700 dogs in their kennels, and not a single dog was allowed to be placed outside of the kennel. Dogs that did not look the part, or which were deemed to be not of the quality desired, were culled (standard practice the world over until the 1960s). Early dogs were both smooth and rough coat, but the breeding program moved to get rid of smooth coats, and the coat of the final product can best be described as &quot;slape coated&quot;—a short, hard and wiry coat that sheds water and dirt while providing warmth in winter. After only 10 years time the dogs were breeding more-or-less true, with a Patterdale-like appearance, albeit with more red on the undercarriage.

The German Hunting Terrier Club (Deutscher Jagdterrier-Club) was founded in 1926, and the dog was warmly embraced in part because it fit well with the rising nationalistic sentiment within Germany at the time.

In 1938, a German by the name of Max Thiel Sr. bought his first Jagdterrier. Thiel hunted with this dog for only a few years before the start of World War II. During the war Thiel lost his dogs, but after the war he settled in Bavaria and purchased two female dogs, Asta and Naja.

In 1951 Thiel moved to the US, bringing with him Naja. He soon sent for Asta, who was bred and shipped pregnant. In 1954, Armin Schwarz Sr., imported a &quot;champion&quot; sire named Axel, and a few more litters were promulgated. In March 1956, nine Jagdterrier owners met in St. Louis, Missouri, and formed the Jagdterrier Club of America, with the expressed goal of getting the dog recognized by the American Kennel Club. In fact, the club did not prosper and eventually died out.

The Jagdterrier did not become popular in the US for several reasons, not the least of which was that in the US very few people hunt fox to ground. In recent years, with the rise of interest in terrier work in the US, new lines of Jagdterriers have been imported to the US, but most are used for above-ground or barn work due to their size. For a Jagdterrier to do well working underground in the US, it has to be at the absolutely smallest end of the breed standard or even undersized.

Many of the newer/later imports to the US are within the true FCI breed standard (correct size) and are being used successfully both above and below ground, with many reports of their offspring making exceptional hunting, flush and retrieval dogs both on land and in water. Today there are many hunters across the US adopting this courageous, intelligent breed as a hunt companion because of its versatility in various hunt disciplines and aim-to-please attitude.

<text>The Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board (), operating as Manitoba Hydro, is the electric power and natural gas utility in the province of Manitoba, Canada. Founded in 1961, it is a provincial Crown Corporation, governed by the Manitoba Hydro-Electric Board and the Manitoba Hydro Act. Today the company operates 16 interconnected generating stations. It has more than 527,000 electric power customers and more than 263,000 natural gas customers. Since most of the electrical energy is provided by hydroelectric power, the utility has low electricity rates. Stations in Northern Manitoba are connected by a HVDC system, the Nelson River Bipole, to customers in the south. The internal staff are members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 998 while the outside workers are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2034.

Manitoba Hydro headquarters in the downtown Winnipeg Manitoba Hydro Place officially opened in 2009.

== Abbreviated history ==

=== 1873–1960: electric power before Manitoba Hydro ===
The first recorded attempt to extract useful work from a Manitoba river was in 1829 at a flour mill (known as Grant&#x27;s Mill) located on Sturgeon Creek in what is now Winnipeg. This was not successful and the milling equipment was later operated by a windmill.

The first public electric lighting installation in Manitoba was demonstrated at the Davis House hotel on Main Street, Winnipeg, March 12, 1873. In 1880, the Manitoba Electric and Gas Light Company was incorporated to provide public lighting and power, and a year later absorbed the Winnipeg Gas Company. In 1893, the Winnipeg Electric Street Railway Company was formed, and initially purchased power from Manitoba Electric and Gas, but by 1898, it had built its own 1000-horsepower (750 kW) generating plant and purchased Manitoba Electric and Gas.

The first hydroelectric plant in Manitoba operated north of Brandon from 1901 to 1924. Private investors built a earth-fill dam across the Minnedosa River (now known as the Little Saskatchewan River) about a kilometer from its junction with the Assiniboine River. The plant only operated part of the year, with the load carried in the winter months by steam generators. An 11-kV wood-pole transmission line connected the station with the town of Brandon, Manitoba. The dam washed out in 1948 but remains are still visible. A second plant was built by private investors near Minnedosa in 1912 but low water levels meant that it only operated intermittently. In 1920 the plant was replaced by a diesel station owned by the Manitoba Power Commission. The dam still exists today at Minnedosa Lake.

By 1906, Winnipeg Electric Street Railway had constructed a hydroelectric plant on the Winnipeg River near Pinawa, and of 60-kV transmission line. This plant operated year-round until 1951, when it was shut down to allow improved water flow to other Winnipeg River stations. Its remains are still preserved as a provincial park. 
Since the investor-owned Winnipeg Electric Street Railway was charging twenty cents per kilowatt-hour, the City of Winnipeg founded its own utility in 1906. Winnipeg city alderman John Wesley Cockburn (January 9, 1856 – November 9, 1924) had privately secured water rights for a development on the river. With these water rights, the City developed a generating station at Pointe du Bois on the Winnipeg River (which was completed in 1911 and which still operates early in the 21st century). In reaction to this, Winnipeg Electric Street Railway dropped prices to ten cents per kilowatt-hour, but the City-owned utility (Winnipeg Hydro) set a price of 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour which held for many decades.

In 1916, the Province established the Manitoba Power Commission with the object of bringing electric power to communities outside of Winnipeg.

Winnipeg Hydro, Winnipeg Electric Street Railway Company and the Manitoba Hydro Commission all built extensive hydroelectric generating facilities on the Winnipeg River during the period 1916 through 1928. The Great Depression starting in 1929 put an end to rapid growth until after World War II. The City of Winnipeg utility built coal-fired steam generators in 1924 on Amy Street, which were also used for district heating of downtown buildings. During World War Two, electric boilers at Amy Street used surplus hydroelectric power to economize on coal consumption. The City utility also implemented load management on electric water heaters, which allowed them to be turned off during the day and during peak load periods.

In 1949 the Province set up a new utility, the Manitoba Hydro Electric Board (MHEB). In 1953 the MHEB acquired the assets of the Winnipeg Electric Street Railway. The MHEB was tasked with bringing electric power to the rural parts of Manitoba, a task which took until around 1956 to substantially complete.

By 1955 there were three utilities in the province:
* Manitoba Power Commission (Provincial Government)
* Manitoba Hydro Electric Board (Provincial Government)
* Winnipeg Hydro Electric System (City of Winnipeg government).

Two thermal (coal-fired) stations were built at Brandon and Selkirk starting in 1958. These units were intended to operate during low-water years, and burned lignite coal.

In 1957, the first transmission line between Manitoba and North-West Ontario was installed. In 1960, a 138-kV connection to Saskatchewan Power Corporation was completed, and it was later uprated to 230 kV.

=== 1961 to date: the Manitoba Hydro era ===
The Manitoba Power Commission and Manitoba Hydro Electric Board merged in 1961 to form Manitoba Hydro. One of the earlier wholesale accounts to be transferred to Manitoba Hydro in 1956 was the village of Emerson, which had been served up to that point by a cross-border tie to the Otter Tail Power system at Noyes. The last of the private mine-owned utility systems at Flin Flon was purchased by Manitoba Hydro in 1973. The early 1970s also marked the installation of tie lines between Manitoba Hydro and utilities in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Minnesota. The interconnection with the American utilities (Otter Tail Power, Northern States Power, and Minkota Power Cooperative) were used to obtain firm power of 90 MW for the winter of 1970; and since that time these interconnections have also been used for export of energy.

In the period 1974 to 1976, Manitoba Hydro was still studying nuclear power, but it concluded that all hydraulic resources should be developed first before construction of any nuclear facility. Although a research nuclear reactor existed at the Pinawa AECL research facility, no nuclear generating capacity has ever been constructed in Manitoba.

In 1980, the Dorsey-Forbes-Chisago 500,000 volt transmission line interconnecting Manitoba Hydro with Northern States Power in Minnesota was put in service.

In July 1999, Manitoba Hydro purchased the natural gas distribution company Centra Gas Manitoba. In September 2002, Manitoba Hydro purchased Winnipeg Hydro, which formerly provided electric power in the downtown area of Winnipeg.

=== Nelson River development ===

The water power potential of the Nelson River was described as early as 1911, when over 6 million horsepower of potential generation capacity was identified at 11 sites – at a time when the developed hydropower in the rest of Canada was around 1 million horsepower. Between 1955 and 1960, studies were carried out to determine what resources would be available for future hydraulic generation. The stations at Kelsey, Kettle, Long Spruce and Limestone were built on the lower Nelson River to support both Manitoba load growth and export plans. Limestone, the largest generating station in Manitoba, is located on the Lower Nelson only 90 km from Hudson Bay. Long-term firm power sales contracts were signed with Northern States Power. Control dams have turned Lake Winnipeg, the 12th largest lake in the world, into a 25,000 km2 reservoir for the Nelson River generation system. 
The great distance between generating sites on the Nelson River and load centers in southern Manitoba required the use of HVDC transmission lines to bring the energy to market. When these lines were commissioned, they were the longest and highest-voltage direct current lines in the world. The Dorsey converter station is 26 km north-west of the center of Winnipeg.

=== Wind development ===
Starting in 2005, a wind farm was built near St. Leon, Manitoba. Power generated by this privately constructed plant is purchased by Manitoba Hydro for distribution on its network. The capacity of this installation is 99.9 MW, comprising 63 wind turbines of 1.65 MW each. This is the first privately owned grid-connected generation to be constructed in Manitoba in nearly fifty years. Energy produced by this facility is subsidized by the Canadian Government&#x27;s Wind Power Production Incentive, though over the life of the project tax revenue will exceed the value of the initial subsidy.

The 138 megawatt St. Joseph Wind Farm began operation in 2011.

Multiple wind farm sites with capacities between 50 and 200 MW have been studied for Manitoba. The Manitoba OASIS node has generator interconnection evaluation studies for wind farms at Elie, Lena, Darlingford, Boissevain, Killarney, and Minnedosa. Additional probable wind farm sites of up to 200 MW are in the generation queue on the OASIS for St. Leon, St. Laurent, Letellier, Waskada, Alexander, Lizard Lake, Lk. Manitoba Narrows and other locations.

=== Winnipeg Hydro ===
Winnipeg Hydro is a former provider of electrical power for the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Winnipeg Hydro was established in 1906 and was purchased by Manitoba Hydro in 2002.

In 1906, voters approved a $3.25 million expenditure for development of a hydroelectric plan at Pointe du Bois. Immediately following the decision to build the Pointe du Bois plant, the price of electricity charged by the private sector in Winnipeg dropped from 20 cents per kilowatt-hour to 10 cents and subsequently to 7 1/2 cents. After completion of the plant in 1911, Winnipeg Hydro set its rate at 3 1/3 cents per kilowatt-hour. This rate remained unchanged until 1973. Customers of Winnipeg Hydro enjoyed among the lowest electricity rates in North America.

In September 2002, Winnipeg Hydro officially closed its doors embarking on a new era as part of Manitoba Hydro.

==Manitoba Hydro Act==
The &quot;Manitoba Hydro Act&quot; governs Manitoba Hydro. The purpose of the Manitoba Hydro Act was to provide for efficient, economical supply of electric power for the needs of the province. The first version of the act was effective March 31, 1961 and it has been revised since that date. Notably, the Act now carries a provision prohibiting privatization of Manitoba Hydro without a public referendum.

Since 1970, a Minister responsible for the Manitoba Hydro Act has sat on Executive Council of Manitoba. This position is not a full departmental portfolio in the Manitoba executive council, and it is generally held by ministers who also hold other cabinet responsibilities.

== Generating stations ==

Generating station total ratings are approximate. Water flow conditions and station service load may account for some of the difference between rated station output and total unit nameplate rating. In a typical year the hydroelectric plants produce more than ninety-five percent of the energy sold.

== Transmission ==

=== AC system ===
Manitoba Hydro operates an extensive network of more than 9000 km of ac transmission lines. Transmission voltages in use include:
*66 kV
*115 kV
*138 kV
*230 kV
*500 kV

Distribution voltages include 4160 V especially in urban Winnipeg, 12.47 kV and 25 kV, usually on overhead conductors but often in buried cables. Total length of distribution lines is over 80,000 km.

Transmission lines built in Manitoba must withstand a wide temperature range, ice, and occasional high winds. In 1997, a tornado blew down 19 transmission towers of the HVDC system north of Winnipeg, reducing transmission capacity from the North to a small fraction of system capacity. During the several days required for utility employees to repair this line, power was imported from the United States over the 500 kV interconnection. As a consequence, though some major industrial customers were requested to curtail energy use, disruption for most customers remained small.

=== DC system ===
A large portion of the energy generated on the Nelson river is transmitted south on the HVDC Nelson River Bipole system. The two transmission lines BIPOLE I and BIPOLE II, each nearly 900 km long, operate at ± 450 kV and ± 500 kV DC, with converter stations at Gillam and Sundance, and the inverter station, Dorsey, near Rosser. The combined capacity of the two HVDC lines is 3420 MW, or about 68% of the total generation capacity in the province. A third HVDC line, BIPOLE III was completed July 4, 2018. At a cost of $4.7B, it carries 2000 MW capacity over 3076 towers and 1384 km. Two new converter stations were built at Keewatinohk on the Nelson River and at Riel east of Winnipeg. A different route from northern Manitoba was chosen for BIPOLE III in order to provide safety and redundancy in case BIPOLE I and II which run side by side for much of the route and end at the same converter station were simultaneously damaged.

=== Exports ===
Manitoba Hydro has transmission lines connecting with Saskatchewan, Ontario, North Dakota and Minnesota. Ties to the Canadian provinces are of low capacity but a substantial portion of Manitoba Hydro&#x27;s annual generation can be exported over the tie to Minnesota. In 2003, a new line was completed to the United States (the Harvey-Glenboro 230kV line), allowing a firm export capacity of 700 megawatts. In 2005 Manitoba Hydro announced increased interchange up to 500 MW with Ontario, after construction of additional transmission facilities. Manitoba Hydro&#x27;s largest interconnection is the Dorsey-Forbes-Chisago 500,000 volt (AC) line that begins at the Dorsey substation located in Rosser near Winnipeg and travels south into the United States and takes a southeasterly direction to the Forbes Substation northwest of Duluth, Minnesota and from there goes south to the Chisago substation located just north of St. Paul, Minnesota.

Manitoba Hydro also participates in &quot;border accommodation&quot; transfers, where it provides power to isolated extraprovincial end-use loads such as those of the Northwest Angle in Minnesota.

Manitoba Hydro is a member of the MRO Midwest Reliability Organization, a region of the North American Electrical Reliability Council NERC and successor to MAPP (Mid-continent Area Power Pool) since June 15, 2004. Manitoba Hydro continues its membership in MAPP, which retains its function as a generation reserves sharing pool.

Export of electrical energy has been regulated since 1907 in Canada. Since 1959, the National Energy Board licences exports, based on the criteria that the exports are surplus to domestic need and that the price charged is reasonable and in the Canadian public interest. Similarly, exporters of power from the United States into Canada require a United States Export Authorization.

=== Natural gas customers ===
Manitoba Hydro has about 238,000 residential, and 24,700 commercial and industrial customers. In fiscal 2008 total gas revenues were $580 million CAD on 2,165 million cubic metres of gas. Residential consumers account for about 48% of Manitoba gas consumption.

== Recent and current projects ==
Manitoba Hydro has a capital spending program intended to maintain and extend capacity for Manitoba customers, for environmental protection, and to allow export of energy surplus to Manitoba needs to stabilize rates. Some of these projects include:
* &quot;Power Smart&quot;: Manitoba Hydro has operated a Power Smart program since 1991. This project identifies energy conservation and efficiency opportunities for residential, commercial and industrial customers. Measures such as high-efficiency electric motors and improved lighting have offset 292 MW of peak load growth and up to 631 million kW·h per year of energy consumption. In 2005 Manitoba Hydro announced goals of doubling Power Smart capacity savings to 842 MW and 2.6 terawatt-hours by 2018.
* &quot;INROCS (Interlake Nelson River Optical Cable System)&quot; is the replacement of the former microwave links for control of northern generation and transmission with a buried fiber optic cable system. More than 1140 km of cable were buried between the system control center in Winnipeg, to the present northernmost stations near Gillam.
* &quot;Brandon Combustion Turbines&quot;: In 2003, Manitoba Hydro commissioned two simple-cycle gas turbine generating units at the existing plant in Brandon. These natural gas-fuelled units are intended to provide peaking power and supplemental capacity in case of low water levels.
* &quot;Selkirk Natural Gas Conversion&quot;: In 2003, the fuel supply of the Selkirk steam boilers was converted to natural gas. While this is a more expensive fuel than the coal previously used at this plant, it allows the life of the station to be extended without the capital cost required to clean coal emissions up to current standards.
* &quot;Wind Energy Survey&quot;: While Manitoba Hydro is in the process of completing a wind energy survey at five locations, private developers have completed wind farms at St. Leon and St. Joseph, and will sell all power generated to Manitoba Hydro. Manitoba Hydro has not announced an in-service date for additional utility-owned wind generation.
* &quot;New Hydraulic Generation (Keeyask, Conawapa, Notigi) and HVDC Transmission ()&quot;: Studies are continuing to permit eventual construction of new generating projects along the Nelson River. The Keeyask station (formerly known as Gull) would have a capacity of approximately 695 megawatts and started construction in 2014. Expected completion of the station will be in 2019. In February 2009 the Tataskweyak Cree Nation community voted in favor of participation in the project. The 1380 megawatt Conawapa project was initiated but postponed indefinitely in 1992 when Ontario Hydro elected not to purchase firm energy from Manitoba. Planning activities for Conawapa were suspended in 2014 and no environmental hearings are currently scheduled. The potential generating station at Notigi would produce approximately 100 megawatts, and would create no new flooding, but no in-service date has been set for this project, and no plans are in progress to build the station at this time.
* &quot;Pointe du Bois&quot; replacement: In 2007 Manitoba Hydro announced plans to replace the 90-year-old Point du Bois plant with a new $800 million (Canadian) generating project at the same site, with greater output, reliability, and efficiency.
* In September 2009, the company completed its headquarters building, the Manitoba Hydro Tower on Portage Avenue. About 1650 Hydro employees work in this building. It is the 4th tallest building in the city at 112.5 metres to the top of solar chimney with a total of 22 stories and floor space. The building is intended to be one of the most energy-efficient building of its size in North America, and to consume 60% less energy than the national building code requirements.

===Wuskwatim generating station===
Wuskwatim generating station is on the Burntwood River near Thompson. The general civil works contract was awarded in 2008, and first power from the project occurred in June 2012. The plant was officially opened on July 5, 2012, while construction of the remaining two units continued.

This 200 MW station has three hydraulic turbine generator units, causes less than one half square kilometre of new flooding, and has only a small reservoir. This project had the most extensive environmental review of any generating project in Manitoba. Participation of the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (NCN) First Nation was passed by a June 2006 referendum by NCN members. This partnership between NCN and Manitoba Hydro will allow advancement of the in-service date to 2012 and opportunities for additional export revenue. Otherwise the domestic load growth would not require this new capacity until several years later.

Excavation and primary concrete for the dam, powerhouse and spillway was mainly completed by June 2009. The spillway gate hoist housing had been erected and the river closure and diversion occurred in July 2009. Construction required an access road and construction camp site, and a construction power substation, along with services such as water supply and sewage lagoons for the camp. A new 230 kV gas-insulated substation was constructed adjacent to the dam site, which will distribute power from the Wuskwatim generators to the transmission network. A cofferdam was constructed for excavation of the tailrace and spillway channel, and subsequently removed. Secondary concrete and turbine installation continued through the summer and fall of 2010. The construction camp population varies according to activity level but as of July 2010 there were 635 workers in the construction camp.

===Potential future projects===

More than 5000 MW of hydroelectric potential could be developed in Manitoba, which includes 1380 MW at the Conawapa site, 695 MW at the Keeyask site, and 1000 MW at the Gillam Island site, all on the lower Nelson river. Other sites have been assessed but are not currently under study for development. All of these developments would require a large increase in electric power exports, since Manitoba load growth will not require this capacity for a generation or more. All of these projects require additional HVDC transmission capacity from the North to the South. One such project, Bipole III, has been discussed with communities on the east side of Lake Winnipeg, but this area is ecologically and culturally sensitive and power line construction will require extensive environmental impact assessment.

== Controversies and issues ==
Like any other large-scale activity, the operations of Manitoba Hydro have not been without controversy.

* In 1976, the Churchill River diversion project was set into operation. Flow was diverted by a series of channels and control structures into the Nelson River. The effects of this diversion on pre-existing water levels and the indigenous Cree and Métis people continue to be felt to this day. Negotiations between the affected Northern communities and Manitoba Hydro continue, to discuss mitigation measures and compensation for loss of traditional resource areas and sites.
* The water level of Lake Winnipeg is now regulated by Manitoba Hydro as part of the energy generation operations. Some property owners on the southern edge of the lake feel that the levels are now maintained at a higher average level than would be natural, and attribute erosion of their property to the lake level. Manitoba Hydro has pointed out that the regulation project also allows lake level to be lowered, such as during the 1997 floods, thereby preventing significant property damage.
* Residents of the area around the Selkirk steam plant attributed various environmental damage to the continued operation of this plant, which at the time was fuelled by coal. Manitoba Hydro has converted this plant to natural gas, which, while a more expensive and faster-depleting energy source than coal, burns with lower emissions of heavy metals, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide.
* The Province of Manitoba charges Manitoba Hydro a water rental fee proportionate to the total volume of water passed through the generating stations. Increases in this rental have provided an important stream of non-tax revenue to the Provincial government. While at first glance it may seem for the provincial government to collect such fees from a company it owns, the government argues that such fees help ensure that Manitobans receive a direct return on that portion of energy resources that is exported. More controversially, in 2002–2004 the New Democratic Party provincial government collected a direct dividend from Manitoba Hydro. This was criticized by the provincial opposition parties for various reasons but mostly as evidence that Hydro rates were unnecessarily high with the excess amounting to a hidden tax.
* Manitoba Hydro has studied new HVDC transmission lines to run along the east side of Lake Winnipeg. The additional transmission capacity would be required to develop stations at Keeyask and Conawapa. This plan would offset the concentration of transmission lines in the Interlake area (west of Lake Winnipeg and east of Lake Manitoba), and would provide additional security against transmission failures due to adverse weather or other causes. However, this area has no roads and very little development. Some environmentalists argue that this vast area of boreal forest should not be crossed by a transmission corridor. If roads were built at the same time as the lines, these roads would allow year-round access to small First Nation communities east of the lake; some people feel this would have more adverse than beneficial effects for these communities. From an engineering perspective, there is no connection between building a new transmission line east of Lake Winnipeg, and building a road east of the lake. In May 2005, the provincial government announced that it would not consider any route along the east side of Lake Winnipeg, even though the alternative routes through the Interlake region or west of Lake Manitoba would extend the transmission lines, and increase cost. The western route was chosen by the government to protect the proposed UNESCO biosphere reserve on the east side by local First Nations reserves called Pimachiowin Aki. This decision was criticized by 19 former senior Manitoba Hydro engineers, who were in favour of the East side route.
* A transmission line down the west side of the province could also have adverse environmental effects: several caribou herds use the area near The Pas, several ecological reserves occur on the west side of the province (Lake Winnipegosis Salt Flats, Birch River ), as well as UNESCO&#x27;s Riding Mountain Biosphere Reserve, three provincial parks (Duck Mountain, Clearwater and Kettle Stones), one Park Reserve (Walter Cook Caves ), one Provincial Forest (Porcupine Hills), and two Wildlife Management Areas (Tom Lamb WMA and Saskeram WMA ).

===Tritschler commission inquiry of 1979===
Concerns about the economy and efficiency of Manitoba Hydro&#x27;s development program led the provincial government to form a commission of inquiry in 1977. Project cost overruns, and expanded capital spending during a time of declining electricity demand raised serious doubts about the timing of the Lake Winnipeg Regulation project and the development of projects along the Nelson River. The &quot;Tritschler Commission&quot; (named for Justice George Eric Tritschler (1901–1993) ) delivered its final report in December 1979, which made 51 recommendations on Manitoba Hydro governance, planning, financing and operations.

== Comparison of Manitoba Hydro to other utilities ==
Manitoba Hydro is unusual in North America because it is the sole commercial provider of electrical power in the province of Manitoba. It is a Crown corporation closely regulated by the Provincial government. This status arose because of the history of electrification in the Province, where early private commercial developers required a large initial return on investment owing to the high risks of the projects. This limited the economic benefits that electrification would bring. Manitoba Hydro is required by its regulating legislation to give priority to public benefit over profit.

Another unusual feature of Manitoba Hydro is that it is a completely integrated electrical utility, with generation, transmission, and distribution operations. This means that Manitoba Hydro can consider the total system cost and benefits of any new development, rather than, for example, building generation capacity that relies on a second party for transmission. An example of this approach was seen at the Clean Environment Commission public hearings for the recent Wuskwatim Generation Project and the Wuskwatim Transmission Project, in which environmental reviews for both the generating station and associated transmission facilities were carried out at the same time.

Manitoba Hydro&#x27;s mandate to serve dictates that it builds enough transmission and generating firm capacity to serve the Manitoba home market first. However, in a typical year, more energy is available than the firm capacity. This can be economically exported from the Province. Since this energy is typically sold on short-term contracts or even on a spot market, the returns on these sales increase Manitoba Hydro&#x27;s retained earnings, allowing domestic rates to be stable and low.

Since Manitoba Hydro is a Crown Corporation paying no dividends and not obligated to provide a return on investment to shareholders, energy costs to industrial and residential consumers are lower than they would otherwise be. These lower costs help offset some of the higher costs of doing business in a region far from large markets.

As a Provincial Crown Corporation, investment decisions by Manitoba Hydro are heavily influenced by political and economic goals of the provincial government. For example, in the 1986 Manitoba provincial election, the incumbent New Democratic Party government announced accelerated construction of the Limestone project, with promises of increased employment as a result. Limestone GS was estimated to create 6000 person-years of direct employment, 11,000 of indirect employment over the construction period of eight years. As part of the contract for the ten turbine-generator units, Canadian General Electric agreed to invest $10,000,000 CAD in Manitoba business operations, and to obtain at least 15 per cent of installation labour locally.

== Current activities ==
For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015, Manitoba Hydro serves a peak Manitoba electrical load of more than 4460 megawatts, down 4.9% from the previous year&#x27;s peak (2013 year end for comparison in parentheses)(4500 megawatts). Electrical supply to Manitoba customers was 21.6 terawatt-hours in fiscal 2015 (21.5 2013), with total revenue due to electricity of $1.808 billion ($1.733 billion) CAD. Extraprovincial sales were at 10.28 terawatthours ( 9.1 terawatthours), with normal water flows. The company also delivered 2.07 billion cubic metres (2.05 billion) cubic metres of natural gas in 2015, which contributed $573 million CAD to revenues.

Manitoba Hydro had 6410 employees at the end of the 2015 fiscal year (6493 in 2013). Capital assets were valued at nearly $13.9 billion CAD.

In fiscal 2015 the total generation was 35.0 terawatt-hours (33.2 in fiscal 2013). In 2001 generation was nearly 32.7 terawatt-hours, allowing net export of 12 TW·h to customers in the United States, Ontario and Saskatchewan. A terawatt-hour is the average annual consumption of 70,000 Manitoba residences, 14,100 kW·h per year each. The peak load was 4,535 MW.

In fiscal 2015 Manitoba Hydro obtained 0.16% of its total generated electrical energy from fossil fuel at the Brandon and Selkirk thermal generating stations, and 2.38% from wind energy purchased from the St. Leon and St. Joseph wind power projects. About 0.24% of energy distributed in the province was imported.

A subsidiary company, Manitoba Hydro International, provides electric power consulting services. Manitoba Hydro also operates a high-voltage DC laboratory. Meridium Power, a subsidiary company, markets a line of written-pole AC electric motors suitable for heavy loads on single-phase systems and for power quality improvement. W.I.R.E. Services supplies services to transmission line operators for re-rating and verification of transmission line capacity.

<doc id="1254144" wikidata="Q8027870" url="?curid=1254144" title="November gale">
<text>November gale, the Witch of November, or November Witch, refers to the strong winds that frequently blow across the Great Lakes in autumn. The &quot;witches&quot; are caused by intense low atmospheric pressure over the Great Lakes pulling cold Canadian/Arctic air from the north or northwest and warm Gulf air from the south. When these cold and warm air masses collide, they can result in hurricane force winds that stir up large waves on the lakes.

Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s song &quot;The Wreck of the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;&quot; makes reference to the Witch of November: the storm that wrecked the &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; was 978 mbar, equivalent to a borderline Category 1/2 hurricane. Similar witches have caused numerous shipwrecks over the years. Another storm that hit in November 1998 was 967 mbar, equivalent to a solid Category 2 hurricane. A still stronger storm, of October 2010, brought Minnesota and Wisconsin record low barometric pressures of, respectively, 954.96 and 961.06 mbar (both equivalent to a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale) and lashed Duluth with 81 mph wind gusts and 19-foot seas during the night of October 26–27, 2010.

==Etymology==
November gale is the formally accepted name of the weather phenomenon. &quot;Witch of November&quot; and its variations are historical maritime and meteorological slang. Derivative names include &quot;Witch Storm&quot;, &quot;November Witch&quot;, and &quot;Witch gale&quot;. November is known in the Great Lakes region as the &quot;month of storms&quot;.

&quot;Witch&quot; is mythologic and descriptive of the gales. Descriptors such as &quot;wailing&quot; and &quot;brewing&quot; frequently accompany the phrase. A weather textbook from 1998 said: &quot;That so many ships lay buried beneath the waters of the Lakes is not as much a mythological mystery as a combination of circumstances--both economic and meteorologic--that combine to make the Witch of November as real to the mariners of the upper Midwest as the Mighty Serpent of the Lakes was to the Iroquois and Algonquin.&quot;

==Environmental effects==
Storms attributed to Witches have intensified wildfires with the speed of the wind, caused power outages for more than 200,000 households at a time, and even caused rivers to &quot;run backwards&quot; from wind forcing lake waves into the mouths of rivers. When blizzards follow a Witch, they&#x27;re anticipated to produce massive amounts of precipitation and wind, and be highly damaging to infrastructure and environment.

A large portion of the deaths and shipwrecks on Lake Superior and other Great Lakes are attributed to November Witches.

==Notable November gales==

* The October 2010 North American storm complex brought record low pressures and snow accumulation across the Great Lakes region and the greater U.S. It dissipated early November.
* The &quot;SS Edmund Fitzgerald&quot; sank in a storm November 10, 1975 while carrying taconite across Lake Superior to a port in Detroit, Michigan. 
* The Great Lakes Storm of 1913 (historically referred to as the &quot;Big Blow&quot;, the &quot;Freshwater Fury&quot;, and the &quot;White Hurricane&quot;) was a blizzard with hurricane-force winds that devastated the Great Lakes Basin in the Midwestern United States and Southwestern Ontario, Canada, from November 7 to 10, 1913. The storm was most powerful on November 9, battering and overturning ships on four of the five Great Lakes, particularly Lake Huron.
* The Mataafa Storm of 1905, was a storm that occurred on the Great Lakes on November 27–28, 1905. The system moved across the Great Basin with moderate depth on November 26 and November 27, then east-northeastward across the Great Lakes on November 28. Fresh east winds were forecast for the afternoon and evening of November 27, with storm warnings in effect by the morning of November 28. Storm-force winds and heavy snows accompanied the cyclone&#x27;s passage. The storm, named after the steamship Mataafa, ended up destroying or damaging about 29 vessels, killing 36 seamen, and causing shipping losses of US$ 3.567 million (1905 dollars) on Lake Superior.

==In popular culture==
* Arguably the best known use of the phrase is from Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s folk song &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Twas the witch of November come stealin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Superior, they said, never gives up her dead / When the gales of November come early&quot;
* In 2020 Ohio brewery Earnest Brew Works released a blackberry sour ale named &quot;Gales of November&quot; in honor of the downed &quot;SS Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;, with a re-release due to popular demand in 2022.
* The Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center holds a benefit festival each year known as the Gales of November.

<text>Östermalm (; &quot;Eastern city-borough&quot;) is a 2.56 km2 large district in central Stockholm, Sweden. With 71,802 inhabitants, it is one of Sweden&#x27;s most populous and exclusive districts. It is an extremely expensive area, having the highest housing prices in Sweden.

== History ==
During the reign of the ruler of all of Scandinavia, king Eric of Pomerania in the early 15th century, a royal cowshed/barn was erected on the lands of the village Vädla. Since the town of Stockholm had grown and started to encroach on the borders of that village, there were many complaints about animals causing damage in the town. In the 17th century, the inhabitants of Stockholm were allowed to keep their cattle there. In 1639, parts of the allocated land for the cowshed/barn were put up for development. In 1672 the eastern part became a military exercise field. For the following 200 years, it was the home of some higher officers, but most inhabitants were poor.

A new town plan presented around 1880 implied a grid of streets and avenues that was to become lined with elegant houses, with 4–6 floors. When the plan was implemented, it ended the rustic appearance of the district. The old official name &quot;Ladugårdslandet&quot; (literal meaning &quot;The Barn Land&quot;) was replaced with &quot;Östermalm&quot; (literal meaning Eastern Outer City). Since the Crown had been the owner of parts of the district for centuries, a number of official buildings, museums and higher public educational institutions were located in the area. In the 20th century, a large number of embassies, including those of America, Britain, France, Germany, Poland, Thailand, Norway and Malaysia were established in Östermalm.

The Berwaldhallen (1979), home of both the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Swedish Radio Choir, is situated on Dag Hammarskjölds väg, Östermalm.

<doc id="1254148" wikidata="Q932996" url="?curid=1254148" title="Parallel coordinates">
<text>Parallel Coordinates plots are a common method of visualizing high-dimensional datasets to analyze multivariate data having multiple variables, or attributes.

To plot, or visualize, a set of points in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space, &quot;n&quot; parallel lines are drawn over the background representing coordinate axes, typically oriented vertically with equal spacing. Points in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space are represented as individual polylines with &quot;n&quot; vertices placed on the parallel axes corresponding to each coordinate entry of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional point, vertices are connected with &quot;n-1&quot; polyline segments.

This data visualization is similar to time series visualization, except that Parallel Coordinates are applied to data which do not correspond with chronological time. Therefore, different axes arrangements can be of interest, including reflecting axes horizontally, otherwise inverting the attribute range.

== History ==

The concept of Parallel Coordinates is often said to originate in 1885 by a French mathematician Philbert Maurice d&#x27;Ocagne. d&#x27;Ocagne sought a way to provide graphical calculation of mathematical functions using alignment diagrams called nomograms which used parallel axes with different scales.
For example, a three-variable equation could be solved using three parallel axes, marking known values on their scales, then drawing a line between them, with an unknown read from the scale at the point where the line intersects that scale.

The use of Parallel Coordinates as a visualization technique to show data is also often said to have originated earlier with Henry Gannett in work preceding the Statistical Atlas of the United States
for the 1890 Census, for example his &quot;General Summary, Showing the Rank of States, by Ratios, 1880&quot;, 
that shows the rank of 10 measures (population, occupations, wealth, manufacturing, agriculture, and so forth) on parallel axes connected by lines for each state.

However, both d&#x27;Ocagne and Gannet were far preceded in this by André-Michel Guerry, Plate IV, &quot;Influence de l&#x27;Age&quot;,
where he showed rankings of crimes against persons by age along parallel axes, connecting the same crime across age groups.

Parallel Coordinates were popularised again 87 years later by Alfred Inselberg in 1985 and systematically developed as a coordinate system starting from 1977. Some important applications are in collision avoidance algorithms for air traffic control (1987—3 USA patents), data mining (USA patent), computer vision (USA patent), Optimization, process control, more recently in intrusion detection and elsewhere.

==Higher dimensions==
On the plane with an XY Cartesian coordinate system, adding more dimensions in parallel coordinates (often abbreviated ||-coords, PCP, or PC) involves adding more axes. The value of parallel coordinates is that certain geometrical properties in high dimensions transform into easily seen 2D patterns. For example, a set of points on a line in &quot;n&quot;-space transforms to a set of polylines in parallel coordinates all intersecting at &quot;n&quot; − 1 points. For &quot;n&quot; = 2 this yields a point-line duality pointing out why the mathematical foundations of parallel coordinates are developed in the projective rather than euclidean space. A pair of lines intersects at a unique point which has two coordinates and, therefore, can correspond to a unique line which is also specified by two parameters (or two points). By contrast, more than two points are required to specify a curve and also a pair of curves may not have a unique intersection. Hence by using curves in parallel coordinates instead of lines, the point line duality is lost together with all the other properties of projective geometry, and the known nice higher-dimensional patterns corresponding to (hyper)planes, curves, several smooth (hyper)surfaces, proximities, convexity and recently non-orientability. The goal is to map n-dimensional relations into 2D patterns. Hence, parallel coordinates is not a point-to-point mapping but rather a &quot;n&quot;D subset to 2D subset mapping, there is no loss of information. Note: even a point in nD is not mapped into a point in 2D, but to a polygonal line—a subset of 2D.

==Statistical considerations==

When used for statistical data visualisation there are three important considerations: the order, the rotation, and the scaling of the axes.

The order of the axes is critical for finding features, and in typical data analysis many reorderings will need to be tried. Some authors have come up with ordering heuristics which may create illuminating orderings.

The rotation of the axes is a translation in the parallel coordinates and if the lines intersected outside the parallel axes it can be translated between them by rotations. The simplest example of this is rotating the axis by 180 degrees.

Scaling is necessary because the plot is based on interpolation (linear combination) of consecutive pairs of variables. Therefore, the variables must be in common scale, and there are many scaling methods to be considered as part of data preparation process that can reveal more informative views.

A smooth parallel coordinate plot is achieved with splines. In the smooth plot, every observation is mapped into a parametric line (or curve), which is smooth, continuous on the axes, and orthogonal to each parallel axis. This design emphasizes the quantization level for each data attribute.

== Reading ==
Inselberg () made a full review of how to visually read out parallel coordinates relational patterns. When most lines between two parallel axes are somewhat parallel to each other, it suggests a positive relationship between these two dimensions. When lines cross in a kind of superposition of X-shapes, it&#x27;s a negative relationship. When lines cross randomly or are parallel, it shows there is no particular relationship.

== Limitations ==
In parallel coordinates, each axis can have at most two neighboring axes (one on the left, and one on the right). For a &quot;n&quot;-dimensional data set, at most &quot;n&quot;-1 relationships can be shown at a time without altering the approach. In time series visualization, there exists a natural predecessor and successor; therefore in this special case, there exists a preferred arrangement. However, when the axes do not have a unique order, finding a good axis arrangement requires the use of experimentation and feature engineering. To explore more relationships, axes may be reordered or restructured.

One approach arranges axes in 3-dimensional space (still in parallel, forming a Lattice graph), an axis can have more than two neighbors in a circle around the central attribute, and the arrangement problem can be improve by using a minimum spanning tree. A prototype of this visualization is available as extension to the data mining software ELKI. However, the visualization is harder to interpret and interact with than a linear order.

== Software ==
While there are a large number of papers about parallel coordinates, there are only few notable software publicly available to convert databases into parallel coordinates graphics. Notable software are ELKI, GGobi, Mondrian, Orange and ROOT. Libraries include Protovis.js, D3.js provides basic examples. D3.Parcoords.js (a D3-based library) specifically dedicated to parallel coordinates graphic creation has also been published. The Python data structure and analysis library Pandas implements parallel coordinates plotting, using the plotting library matplotlib.

<text>Bradford William LePage (February 19, 1876 – December 4, 1958) was a Canadian politician and the 15th Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island.

Born in Rusticoville, Prince Edward Island, LePage owned and operated a general store prior to entering politics. He and his family moved to Charlottetown after his election to the provincial legislature. LePage sold his store to his brother, Garfield LePage, and opened the Lepage Shoe Company which was operated for many years by his son, William Reuel, and his grandsons, Walter B. LePage and Don Wonnacott (Don was the last to own and operate The LePage Shoe Co.).

LePage was first elected as a member of the Liberal Party of Prince Edward Island in the district of 2nd Queens in the 1919 election. He was re-elected in the 1927, 1931, 1935, and the 1939 elections.

He was Lieutenant Governor from October 1, 1939 to May 30, 1945.

On February 24, 1897, he married Harriett Christie. They had two children, William Reuel and Hilda Ruth.

<doc id="1254171" wikidata="Q7692287" url="?curid=1254171" title="Technical Pan">
<text>Technical Pan is an almost panchromatic black-and-white film that was produced by Kodak. While it can reproduce the visible light spectrum, it leans to the red, and so unfiltered outdoor shots render blues, most notably the sky, with additional darkening and reds with some lightening. It was generally used as a very slow film, rated at EI 25 or even 16, although it could be rated at up to EI 320 with a distinct loss of tonal range and a bunching of shadow and highlight detail. This film has an unmatched fine grain, especially when rated at a low speed, and makes excellent enlargements while preserving fine details. Kodak stopped selling it in 2004. It has not been replaced by a film (from any manufacturer) with its characteristics (although Kodak&#x27;s own Panchromatic Separation Film 2238, a motion-picture lab film used for making archival positives, has been referred to as &quot;poor man&#x27;s Tech Pan&quot; due to similar properties). Although some of its particularities were unique and no emulsion in actual production could replace it, its resolution capabilities were surpassed by another film by ADOX, CMS 20 II.

Technical Pan is a Continuous tone film emulsion that was made panchromatic through the addition of sensitizing dyes, as is the case with all panchromatic films. If developed in a general-purpose developer such as D-76, Tech Pan displays extreme contrast. It becomes a pictorial film when developed by a very low-contrast developer.

The film can be developed at home, mainly by using the chemical mixture Technidol, which Kodak sold for that purpose alone. Other two-bath &quot;split&quot; developers have been used on Tech Pan as well as highly dilute developers such as Agfa&#x27;s Rodinal. To achieve exact results, small-tank development was often the preferred process and &quot;clip testing&quot; (developing a small piece cut from a roll to test developing times and dilutions) was usually done. Like other panchromatic films, it must be developed in darkness.

When the film was discontinued, Kodak revealed that none had been made for many years nor could any more be made because the coating line had been shut down and many of the materials used to make it had been discontinued, and was still on the market only due to a large roll being found in frozen storage. The film was created for the military and was no longer required for that purpose. Consequently, Kodak cut the roll into commercially viable formats and continued to sell it. Unexposed Technical Pan is now quite valuable.

&quot;Tech Pan&quot; or &quot;Technipan&quot;, as it is often known, was very popular among some professional photographers and astronomers, as it is capable of recording extremely fine detail, and its sensitivity curve extended much further into the red than most films. In particular, it was very sensitive to light emitted by hydrogen at 656.28 nm (H-alpha), which made it very useful for a wide range of astronomical imaging. Tech Pan was also useful for electron and laser photography. The film was popular with photographers in the art and fashion industries for its extremely high-contrast results when up-rated and processed in an abrasive, high-strength developer.

This description comes from Kodak publication No. P-255, copyright 1985:

<doc id="1254179" wikidata="Q645965" url="?curid=1254179" title="Ed Viesturs">
<text>Edmund &quot;Ed&quot; Viesturs (; born June 22, 1959) is an American high-altitude mountaineer, corporate speaker, and well known author in the mountain climbing community. He was the first American to climb all 14 of the eight-thousander mountains, and the 5th person to do so without supplemental oxygen. Along with Apa Sherpa, he has summitted eight-thousanders on 21 occasions, including Mount Everest seven times.

Viesturs took part in the 1996 IMAX filming of &quot;Everest&quot; shortly after the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, which became the highest grossing documentary up to that time. Thirteen days after the disaster, his team summited Everest accompanied by a film crew. He also had a cameo in the 2000 film &quot;Vertical Limit&quot;. Clive Standen plays Viesturs in the 2015 remake of &quot;Everest&quot; telling of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster.

==Early life==
Viesturs was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, of Latvian and German descent. He was raised in Rockford, Illinois, Viesturs moved to Seattle, Washington in 1977 to attend the University of Washington. It was here that he began his mountaineering career on the slopes of Mount Rainier. Viesturs graduated from the University of Washington in 1981 with a BS in zoology and worked as a guide for Rainier Mountaineering. He later obtained a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree from Washington State University.

==Climbing career==
His interest in mountaineering was sparked in high school by reading Maurice Herzog&#x27;s account of the first climb of Annapurna, titled &quot;Annapurna&quot;. After climbing Kangchenjunga in 1989, Mount Everest in 1990 and K2 in 1992, Viesturs became an international mountain guide and was sponsored for full-time mountaineering. He served as a guide for Rob Hall&#x27;s Adventure Consultants company during their 1995 Everest expedition. Viesturs climbs with Finnish partner Veikka Gustafsson.

In 1992, he and fellow American Scott Fischer brought down French climber Chantal Mauduit, suffering from exhaustion, after her summit of K2. Viesturs was in the IMAX climbing team during the 1996 Everest Disaster. He was featured in David Breashears&#x27; documentary film &quot;Everest&quot; (1998), and filming was delayed as a blizzard struck. The IMAX team postponed shooting and followed Viesturs up the mountain to aid the stranded climbers. The team ultimately decided to keep going, and summitted Everest on May 23, 1996. Viesturs was also featured in the &quot;Nova&quot; television documentary, &quot;Everest: The Death Zone&quot; (1998), in which he and Breashears climbed Everest to the summit, while undergoing physical and mental tests to record the effects of altitude on humans.

In July 2003, Viesturs and a Kazakh team, headed by Denis Urubko, were instrumental in the rescue of French climber Jean-Christophe Lafaille from Broad Peak. Lafaille had developed high-altitude pulmonary edema and was unable to complete his descent. They coordinated a rescue attempt in the dark, and were able to get Lafaille safely off the mountain and helicoptered out for medical help.

In 2005, Viesturs became the first American, and 12th climber in history, to summit all 14 mountains over 8,000 meters (collectively known as the eight-thousanders). He is the 5th climber in history to do it without using supplemental oxygen. Viesturs has summitted Mount Everest seven times. Research published in 2022 estimated that Viesturs was one of only three climbers in history to have stood on the &quot;true&quot; geographical summit of all the eight-thousanders and that Viesturs was the first to do so.

Viesturs&#x27; more recent climbs have included Broad Peak (the world&#x27;s 12th highest mountain) and Nanga Parbat (the world&#x27;s ninth highest mountain) in 2003, Annapurna (the world&#x27;s 10th highest mountain) in 2005, and Mount Everest (for the seventh time) in 2009. On July 8, 2009 he led an expedition to Mount Rainier as part of the United Way Climb for the Community effort. UCLA coach Jim Mora, Seahawks CEO Tod Leiweke, and NFL commissioner Roger Goodell took part in this charitable enterprise, summiting the 14,410 ft peak. Viesturs led an expedition to Antarctica, in January 2011, to climb its highest peak, Vinson Massif. In May 2021, he summitted Mount Rainier for the 216th time. Viesturs now acts as a guide for RMI Expeditions.

==Other work==
Viesturs was a cinematographer for the film &quot;Trio for One&quot; (2003), which told the story of French alpinist Jean-Christophe Lafaille&#x27;s mission to climb Dhaulagiri, Nanga Parbat, and Broad Peak in a period of two months. He acts as a design consultant for manufacturers of outdoor equipment, and is a representative of his adopted hometown&#x27;s football team, the Seattle Seahawks. He is a member of the board of directors for Big City Mountaineers, an urban youth organization that offers wilderness experiences. Viesturs has also found a niche as a corporate motivational speaker.

==Awards==
Viesturs is a recipient of the David A. Sowles Memorial Award (1992) from the American Alpine Club. He is also the recipient of the Explorers Club Lowell Thomas Award (2001) He was named National Geographic&#x27;s Adventurer of the Year (2005).

<text>Ruggiero Ricci (24 July 1918 – 5 August 2012) was an American violinist known for performances and recordings of the works of Paganini.

==Biography==
He was born in San Bruno, California, the son of Italian immigrants who first named him Woodrow Wilson Rich. His brother was cellist George Ricci (1923–2010), originally named George Washington Rich. His sister Emma played violin with the New York Metropolitan Opera. His father first taught him to play the violin. At age seven, Ricci studied with Louis Persinger and Elizabeth Lackey. Persinger would become his piano accompanist for many recitals and recordings.

Ricci gave his first public performance in 1928 at the age of 10 in San Francisco where he played works by Wieniawski and Vieuxtemps. He gained a reputation for being a child prodigy. At the age of 11, he gave his first orchestral performance, playing the Mendelssohn concerto, and soon after he had his highly successful debut at Carnegie Hall.
In the 1930s Ricci studied in Berlin with Georg Kulenkampff, where he learned a &quot;German style&quot; of playing in the tradition of Adolf Busch. He also studied with and Paul Stassevich.

He served in the US Army from 1942 until 1945, where he was an &quot;entertainment specialist&quot;.

In 1947, Ricci was the first violinist to record the complete 24 Caprices, Op. 1, by Paganini, in their original form. Ricci&#x27;s first recording was on the Decca recording label. After his time in the military, he uncovered many pieces by 19th-century composers that he would perform solo. In 1993, he recorded the &quot;Complete Works for Violin and Orchestra&quot; by Saint-Saens&quot;.&quot; He also performed the world premieres of pieces by many contemporary composers, including the violin concertos by Gottfried von Einem, Carlos Veerhoff and Alberto Ginastera.

Aside from performing over 6,000 concerts in 65 countries during his 70-year solo career, Ricci also made over 500 recordings, on every major label. He taught violin at Indiana University, the Juilliard School and the University of Michigan. He also taught at the University Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria. Ricci held master classes in the United States and Europe. He wrote &quot;Left Hand Technique&quot;, a pedagogical volume for violin published by G. Schirmer. The Persian volume of this book is also published by Mohsen Kazemian, Iran.

Ricci died of heart failure in August 2012 at his home in Palm Springs, California, aged 94.

== Selected performances ==
With the aim of showcasing great masterpieces of violin concerto repertoire, Ricci, accompanied by members of the American Symphony Orchestra, performed 15 concertos over a series of four concerts at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Philharmonic Hall, all in a span of 30 days, under a different conductor each time.

<text>Hugh Joseph Addonizio (January 31, 1914 – February 2, 1981) was an American Democratic Party politician who was sentenced to prison for corruption. He was the 33rd Mayor of Newark, New Jersey, from 1962 to 1970, and a U.S. Congressman from 1949 to 1962.

==Early life and education==
Born in Newark to an Italian family, Addonizio attended West Side High School and played quarterback at Saint Benedict&#x27;s Preparatory School. Addonizio graduated from Fordham University in New York City in 1939, attending with an athletic scholarship, and went to work for A&amp;C Clothing Company, working for his father, where he became vice president in 1946.

==World War II==
During World War II he had served in the United States Army earning the Silver Star; he served in North Africa, Italy and France. Addonizio was among the first Americans drafted in 1940, a year before Pearl Harbor. He rose from the rank of private, was discharged with the rank of captain, and was named to the Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame at Fort Benning.

==Political career==
In 1948, he ran for and won a seat in the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat, representing . He resigned his seat on June 30, 1962, to run for mayor of Newark. He ran on a reform platform, defeating what he characterized as the corrupt political machine of Leo P. Carlin, who had been mayor since 1953.

===Corruption investigation===
Addonizio served as mayor from 1962 until 1970, when he lost his reelection bid. A state investigation into his administration commenced following the 1967 Newark riots that occurred during his tenure, which led to the discovery that he and other city officials were taking kickbacks from city contractors. In December 1969, he and nine current or former officials of the municipal administration in Newark were indicted by a federal grand jury; five other persons were also indicted.

In July 1970, the former mayor and four other defendants were found guilty by a federal jury on 64 counts each, one of conspiracy and 63 of extortion. In September 1970, Addonizio was sentenced to ten years in federal prison and fined $25,000 by U.S. District Court Judge George H. Barlow for his role in a plot that involved the extortion of $1.5 million in kickbacks, a crime that the judge said &quot;tore at the very heart of our civilized society and our form of representative government&quot;.

Addonizio served around half of his ten-year sentence before being released on parole.

==Death==
Addonizio died of cardiac arrest in 1981 and was interred in Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover.

<text>Salawa Abeni Alidu (born 5 May 1961) is a Nigerian singer. An Ijebu Yoruba from Ijebu Waterside, in Ogun State, she began her professional career in waka music when she released her debut album titled, &quot;Late General Murtala Ramat Mohammed&quot;, in 1976, on Leader Records. It became the first recording by a female artist in Yoruba Songs to sell over a million copies in Nigeria.

Abeni continued recording for Leader until 1986, when she ended a relationship with the record label&#x27;s owner, Lateef Adepoju. She married Kollington Ayinla and joined his record label instead, staying with him until 1994.

She was crowned &quot;Queen of Waka Music&quot; by the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi in 1992. Waka is an Islamic-influenced, traditional Yoruba music style, popularized by Batile Alake; it is a much older genre than jùjú and fuji.

==Controversy==
When speaking to the News Agency of Nigeria, Abeni created controversy when she advised fellow musicians to &quot;stay away from homosexuality&quot;, likening it to drug addiction. Activists called her comments &quot;a display of ignorance&quot;, however her remarks were recently echoed by Nigerian model Olajumoke Orisaguna in her YouTube video &quot;Olajumoke Sauce 7: Trends and Acceptance&quot; uploaded in February 2018. Under Nigerian law based on British colonial jurisprudence, same-sex relationships between LGBT people remain a criminal offence, with maximum punishments ranging from 14 years imprisonment to a death penalty.

<text>Andrew Neiderman (born October 26, 1940) is an American novelist. In 1987, he became the ghost writer for V. C. Andrews following her death in 1986. He formerly taught English at Fallsburg Jr./Sr. High School, in upstate New York.

Neiderman is arguably best known as the author of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, later adapted into a film starring Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, and Charlize Theron, and directed by Taylor Hackford. Neiderman also adapted the novel &quot;Rain&quot; into a film, based on a series of novels released under Andrews&#x27;s name.

Neiderman wrote the stage adaptation of &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; based on the novel by V.C. Andrews, published online in 2014. The world premiere was produced in New Orleans, Louisiana, in August 2015 by See &#x27;Em On Stage: A Production Company and was directed by Christopher Bentivegna.

Neiderman has written the libretto for a musical stage adaptation of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;.

He also co-authored the screenplay for &quot;Duplicates&quot;, a USA Network cable movie, and has had six of his other novels adapted into films.

With the publication of &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; by Dorchester Publishers in January 2010, Neiderman has, between his V. C. Andrews novels and those under his name, reached 125 published novels.

A resident of Palm Springs, California, Neiderman was honored with a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars on October 17, 1997.

<doc id="1254205" wikidata="Q1026394" url="?curid=1254205" title="Breakaway (Kelly Clarkson album)">
<text>Breakaway is the second studio album by American pop singer Kelly Clarkson, released on November 30, 2004 in Canada and in the United States, by RCA Records, with a wider release following throughout 2005. Despite the commercial success of Clarkson&#x27;s debut album &quot;Thankful&quot; (2003), music critics still continued to typecast her as an &quot;American Idol&quot; winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she collaborated with a range of new songwriters and producers such as Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, and with former Evanescence members Ben Moody and David Hodges. This overhaul also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album&#x27;s release.

A sonic departure from the R&amp;B-oriented &quot;Thankful&quot;, &quot;Breakaway&quot; is primarily a pop rock record with rock and soul elements, whose lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism. It received a positive response from music critics, with many commending the album&#x27;s new-found pop rock sound and Clarkson&#x27;s vocal performances. It won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, garnering many other nominations and awards. 

&quot;Breakway&quot; became a commercial success worldwide; with estimated sales of 12 million copies worldwide, it&#x27;s Clarkson&#x27;s best-selling album. It topped the charts of Ireland and Netherlands and reached the top ten in a number of countries, being the seventh best-selling album of 2005. In the United States, it debuted and peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, staying on the top twenty of the chart for over a year due to the continued success of its singles. It eventually was certified 6× multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of more than six million copies.

&quot;Breakaway&quot;″s singles &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot;, &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;, &quot;Because of You&quot;, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, and &quot;Breakaway&quot; became worldwide hits and have become some of Clarkson&#x27;s signature songs. Their successes prompted &quot;Billboard&quot; to credit her for landscaping the core sound of mainstream pop music as an uptempo dance-oriented sound in the 2000s. Furthermore, &quot;Breakaway&quot; established Clarkson as one of the four highest-selling acts of Sony BMG in the 2000s. To promote the album, Clarkson embarked on three international concert tours from 2005 to 2006: the Breakaway Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and the Addicted Tour. &quot;Billboard&quot; placed the album 77th in the &quot;Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums&quot;.

==Background and production==
In early 2004, Clarkson began working on new material for her second studio album, which followed her successful debut album &quot;Thankful&quot; (2003), while co-headlining the Independent Tour with Clay Aiken, the runner-up from the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot;. She had also expressed intentions to record with Fantasia Barrino, who had then just won the series&#x27; third season; both were expected to release their albums in the same month.

As she began to work for the album with music executive Clive Davis, Clarkson was invited by Whitney Houston to record the song &quot;Breakaway&quot;, which would be included for the soundtrack of the 2004 Walt Disney Pictures feature film &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot;, which Houston had co-produced. The song, written by Matthew Gerrard, Bridget Benenate, and Avril Lavigne, was initially written for Lavigne&#x27;s debut album &quot;Let Go&quot; (2002) but deemed unsuitable for the album&#x27;s themes at the time. Initially reluctant, Clarkson agreed to record the song. &quot;Breakaway&quot; was first released in July 2004 by Walt Disney Records as a single from the soundtrack, acting as an interim record until her second album&#x27;s lead single was released. After debuting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at number 60, it peaked at number six, a week before the album&#x27;s release.

In April 2004, Clarkson entered the studio immediately after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, &quot;I&#x27;ve written most of (the songs) so far, but there&#x27;s some people who have some stuff for me. I&#x27;m not one of those people who thinks you have to write everything. (I&#x27;ll sing it) as long as I can relate to it.&quot; During the album&#x27;s development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He mentioned &quot;I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn&#x27;t insist on writing their own material.&quot;

Clarkson reiterated that she had been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, &quot;I just think it&#x27;s funny that all these middle-age guys told me, &#x27;You don&#x27;t know how a pop song needs to sound.&#x27; I&#x27;m a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone.&quot; In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know that he (Moody) wasn&#x27;t with Evanescence anymore,&quot; Clarkson said. &quot;I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, &#x27;Hey, do you think that he&#x27;d work with me?&#x27; And then I found out that he kind of split and that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s doing ... so it worked out perfectly.&quot; Moody recalled, &quot;It&#x27;s cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I&#x27;m doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It&#x27;s just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently.&quot;

Worried of Clarkson being continually typecast as a talent show winner, Davis met with various producers, primarily Max Martin, and encouraged them to produce records for Clarkson in a pop rock direction. Clarkson revealed that she expected that she&#x27;ll always be labeled as an &quot;American Idol&quot; winner; she remarked, &quot;I&#x27;m the first one, so it&#x27;s going to be on my grave, I&#x27;m aware of that. (There&#x27;s no getting away from it) so why even try?&quot; Upon their meeting, Martin presented songs he wrote with Dr. Luke. These songs include &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and a demo version of what would have been &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;. Davis wanted Clarkson to record the songs, describing them having &quot;a sharp rock edge but were still capable of being pop hits. They would push Kelly in a promising direction for her, while maintaining and even growing her audience.&quot; Martin insisted that the songs should be given to rock acts, wanting to stray from his reputation for producing pop singles for the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears in the 1990s. Davis recalled, &quot;Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys, and I really spent time convincing them that an &quot;American Idol&quot; winner could bring all the feeling and passion that was required to the song.&quot;

Martin and Dr. Luke eventually agreed and invited Clarkson to travel to Sweden to record the songs. Upon hearing the tracks, Clarkson was skeptical of the pop elements. The three eventually decided to develop a rock sound, a move Clarkson claimed Davis did not approve. Davis reiterated that he was ecstatic with the prospect, claiming that she disliked it and demanded that both the songs be removed from the album. Clarkson then asserted that she wanted it to be on the record and claimed that Davis had detested &quot;Because of You&quot; instead, saying that she &quot;was a shitty writer (&quot;sic&quot;) who should be grateful for the gifts that he bestows upon her&quot;. Davis reiterated that he loved the song and felt that Clarkson could indeed write hits.

==Music and lyrics==
Wanting to stray away from the R&amp;B-styled music of &quot;Thankful&quot;, which she described as a showcase of versatility, she revealed that &quot;Thankful&quot;″s success &quot;empowered me to step more into rock, step more into the soulful vibe.&quot; She described the music of the second album as &quot;like the first CD in the sense that it&#x27;s versatile, but it&#x27;s more into the rock, It&#x27;s more into the soulful roots, and it&#x27;s just a little bit deeper, so it&#x27;s pretty cool.&quot; Dr. Luke revealed in an interview that alternative music and indie music were inspirations to &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot;, saying, &quot;That was a conscious move by Max [Martin] and myself, because we were listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song-I don&#x27;t remember what it was. I said, &#x27;Ah, I love this song,&#x27; and Max was like, &#x27;If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!&#x27; It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we do that, but put a big chorus on it?&#x27; It worked.&quot; Songs such as &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Because of You&quot; were also inspired by her real life experiences, the former about her relationship with an ex-boyfriend and the latter about her experience after her parents&#x27; divorce.
Clarkson shares writing credits on six songs from &quot;Breakaway&quot;. &quot;Breakaway&quot; was included as the album&#x27;s opening and title track. She described it as a simple song, and further explained, &quot;I think that its simplicity is what&#x27;s beautiful about it. Whenever writers or producers come to work with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What&#x27;s cool about &#x27;Breakaway&#x27; is that it doesn&#x27;t take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I&#x27;ve done country music, I&#x27;ve done pop, I&#x27;ve done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I&#x27;ve done; people didn&#x27;t even know it was me!&quot; Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot;, as &quot;not as &quot;smooth&quot; as pop or R&amp;B. Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, &quot;It&#x27;s very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live.&quot; Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;, was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, &quot;I wrote &#x27;Behind These Hazel Eyes&#x27; about my last boyfriend. It&#x27;s the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn&#x27;t make the deadline.&quot; The fourth track, &quot;Because of You&quot;, was originally intended for &quot;Thankful&quot;. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. &quot;Gone&quot;, the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, &quot;Addicted&quot;, was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence&#x27;s debut album &quot;Fallen&quot; (2003). She remarked, &quot;I wanted to work with someone as passionate about music as I am. And then I heard that Evanescence record ... I loved their record because of the passion behind it.

Clarkson co-wrote the seventh track, &quot;Where Is Your Heart&quot;, with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She revealed that it was also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as &quot;wanting to get really into our relationship, and I just thought, &#x27;Where are you in our relationship?&#x27;&quot; &quot;Walk Away&quot;, the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as &quot;one of the brighter songs&quot; on &quot;Breakaway&quot;, and said that &quot;It&#x27;s very blunt and to the point. &#x27;I&#x27;m done with you, you&#x27;re upsetting me.&#x27;&quot; DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, &quot;You Found Me&quot;. Clarkson revealed, &quot;When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting at the time that I recorded it.&quot; DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, &quot;I Hate Myself for Losing You&quot;, with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as &quot;depressing&quot;, but felt it could be used as a foreshadowing device. She explained &quot;I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out.&quot; The eleventh track, &quot;Hear Me&quot;, was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, &quot;The song is almost like a prayer to God. I haven&#x27;t met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That&#x27;s what the song is. &#x27;God, I&#x27;m ready for &#x27;the one!&#x27;&quot; The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of &quot;Beautiful Disaster&quot;, originally from &quot;Thankful&quot;. Clarkson admitted that she hated &quot;Thankful&quot;″s version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.

==Release and promotion==

&quot;Breakaway&quot; was first released in North America on November 30, 2004, by RCA Records, 19 Recordings, and S Records, following an influx of releases by &quot;American Idol&quot; contestants Clay Aiken, Ruben Studdard, and Fantasia Barrino. &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Jeff Leeds noted that the releases could benefit from the holiday season, but &quot;it could also hinder their efforts to establish themselves as recording artists with distinctive personalities and the legitimacy needed for long careers.&quot; Clive Davis reiterated that the release was intended to recede from their ties from &quot;American Idol&quot;, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not interested in merely souvenir sales&quot;. The album was titled &quot;Breakaway&quot; to capitalize on the success of &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; soundtrack single &quot;Breakaway&quot;, which was also reissued as the album&#x27;s final single. Immediately before the album was released, Clarkson left 19 Management, dismissed Fuller as her manager, and quickly hired the managing services of Jeff Kwatinetz of The Firm, though still contracted to 19 Recordings.

A promotion plan was created for Clarkson for &quot;Breakaway&quot;″s release. Davis positioned her to be RCA&#x27;s top global priority, and at the recommendation of The Firm, removed &quot;American Idol&quot; from her official biography. Rather than being booked on arenas for her tour, Kwatinetz booked Clarkson for smaller amphitheaters to hone her performance skills. He remarked, &quot;&quot;American Idol&quot; gave her a lot of exposure that allowed her to skip some steps in her development, and that&#x27;s hazardous.&quot; &quot;Breakaway&quot; was first released internationally on January 3, 2005, by the Bertelsmann Music Group (now Sony Music Entertainment), and was released in the United Kingdom on July 18, 2005, by RCA. In November 2005, a special edition CD+DVD was released, containing additional bonus tracks and music videos.

Clarkson, along with Studdard and Barrino, hosted a television musical special on the Fox Broadcasting Company entitled &quot;Kelly, Ruben &amp; Fantasia: Home for Christmas&quot; on November 25, 2004. On the eve of &quot;Breakaway&quot;″s release, she performed &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. In February 2005, she appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to perform &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and &quot;Breakaway&quot;. In September 2005, she appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and performed &quot;Breakaway&quot; as well as &quot;Because of You&quot;. Clarkson also performed in award ceremonies and events; she performed &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; on the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards at the American Airlines Arena and on the Brit Awards 2006 at the Earls Court. She performed &quot;Because of You&quot; on the 48th Annual Grammy Awards at the Staples Center and on the 15th Echo Awards at the Estrel Hotel.

From 2005 to 2006, Clarkson embarked on three concert tours to promote &quot;Breakaway&quot;: the Breakaway Tour, Hazel Eyes Tour, and the Addicted Tour. The Breakaway Tour, which took place before, in between and after the Hazel Eyes Tour, marked Clarkson&#x27;s first world tour, visiting theaters and arenas throughout North America, Europe and Oceania. The Hazel Eyes tour took place in various theaters throughout North America, with the concert at UCF Arena being streamed live on AOL and AOL Radio. Upon returning to the United States, she then embarked on the Addicted Tour, performing at various amphitheaters across the United States.

==Singles==
&quot;Breakaway&quot;″s lead single, &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot;, was released in November 2004, but gained traction at the beginning of 2005. After debuting at number seventy, it peaked on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number two, and stayed in the chart&#x27;s top ten for 20 weeks. Despite a number two peak, &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; remains as Clarkson&#x27;s most successful single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, outpacing even her number one hits on the chart. It also topped nine other &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Top 40 and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Mix Show Airplay, and became a successful hit around the world. The second single, &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;, was released in April 2005 and continued the chart success. After debuting at number 87 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, it peaked at number six while &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; was still in the top ten. It stayed on the chart&#x27;s top ten for 15 weeks, and also became an international hit.

The third single, &quot;Because of You&quot;, released in August 2005, performed successfully along with its predecessors, peaking at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. While &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; became &quot;Breakaway&quot;″s most successful release in the United States, &quot;Because of You&quot; became the album&#x27;s most successful release internationally. It topped the Dutch Top 40 chart in the Netherlands, the Schweizer Hitparade chart in Switzerland, the Tracklisten Airplay chart in Denmark and became a number one single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; European Hot 100 Singles chart; while also attaining a top ten position in nine regions. The follow-up track, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, was released in January 2006 as &quot;Breakaway&quot;″s fourth single and its final release in the United States. After debuting at number 97, it peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and became a top forty hit internationally. Originally released as a single from &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; soundtrack in July 2004, the title track &quot;Breakaway&quot; was reissued as the album&#x27;s fifth and final single in May 2006. After peaking on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number six, it became a top twenty hit internationally.

==Critical reception==
The album received positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who gave it four out of five stars, wrote &quot;what gives &quot;Breakaway&quot; its spine are the driving, anthemic pop tunes, numbers that sound simultaneously mainstream and youthful, which is a hard trick to pull off&quot; and describing the tracks as the ones that illustrate Clarkson as a rare thing in the 2000s: &quot;a pop singer who&#x27;s neither hip nor square, just solidly and enjoyably in the mainstream.&quot; Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Dave Donnelly gave it a &quot;4&quot; rating, remarking that &quot;&quot;Breakaway&quot; is not a &quot;Thriller&quot; to her &quot;Off The Wall&quot; by no means, but she has at least created a rare type of album: a one that offers a full selection of potential singles, reminiscent of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Bad&quot; or &quot;Thriller&quot;, which he described as having a mass appeal with artistic integrity and perceived longevity. &quot;Breakaway&quot; may be remembered in years to come as a pop classic, alongside Madonna&#x27;s early material perhaps.&quot; Raymond Fiore of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a &quot;B&quot; rating, noting its rock direction and describing it as &quot;Avril-meets-Evanescence, with a splash of Pat Benatar.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave &quot;Breakaway&quot; a three-and-a-half star rating and commented that &quot;though her rocky leanings were hinted at on the less coherent &quot;Thankful&quot; Charles Merwin wrote for &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; that the album&#x27;s probable non-singles still maintain a quality &quot;high enough to quell worries about the &quot;I love the singles, but that&#x27;s all I really need to hear&quot; arguments.&quot; He described Clarkson as ranking somewhere at the top of her class as far as rock albums go among the teen pop set, saying that she &quot;has a long way to go before we&#x27;ll ever feel comfortable calling her anything besides an &quot;American Idol&quot;, but for now she has a sound that seems believable enough to support her considerable chops.&quot; In a quick review, &quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;Breakaway&quot; as a &quot;rare exhibition of substance over style&quot;.

Some critics, however, were less impressed by the album. Shirley Halperin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; offered a mixed review by giving the album a three-star rating and saying &quot;Clarkson isn&#x27;t ready for her new sound.&quot; She asked, &quot;You can&#x27;t help but wonder, Who is the real Kelly Clarkson, and when will she stop wearing her big sister&#x27;s hand-me-downs?&quot; Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave it a two-star rating, saying that &quot;the title track expresses Clarkson&#x27;s novel desire to &quot;spread my wings and learn to fly&quot;, but settles into a catchy enough rut at times.&quot;

==Accolades==

&quot;Breakaway&quot; received various accolades from several music industry awards. It won Grammy Awards for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; at the 48th ceremony, making Clarkson the first alumnus ever from &quot;American Idol&quot; to win in the awards show. The album was also nominated for a Juno Award for International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2006. In the American Music Awards of 2005, &quot;Breakaway&quot; received four nominations, including Favorite Pop/Rock Album, and earned Clarkson two awards for Artist of the Year and Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist. In addition, Clarkson won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist at the American Music Awards of 2006. The album also won nine out of her twelve nominations at the 2005 Billboard Music Awards. At the 2005 Teen Choice Awards, &quot;Breakaway&quot; won four awards, including a Choice Album award. At the TMF Awards, the album enabled Clarkson to win three awards, including a Best Pop Artist and a Best Female Artist award.

&quot;Breakaway&quot; also appeared on decade-end best-of lists. &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked it as the ninth best album of the 2000s. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it as the 29th of the 100 best albums from 1988 to 2008. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it as the 11th top album in their decade-end reader&#x27;s poll.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Breakaway&quot; is currently Clarkson&#x27;s most successful release to date, with sales of over 12 million copies worldwide. On the week ending December 18, 2004, the album debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in the United States with 250,000 copies sold, which were 47,000 less than her first week sales of &quot;Thankful&quot;. Music commercial analysts noted that Clarkson&#x27;s commercial appeal has endured beyond &quot;American Idol&quot;, but also commented on its slumping performance. &quot;Billboard&quot; director Geoff Mayfield noted the lackluster performance may have been caused by being released in a competitive holiday market. Despite failing to top the chart, the record stayed on the top twenty of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 61 consecutive weeks, and became the first title in five years to spend its entire year in the top twenty of the chart. By the end of 2005, &quot;Breakaway&quot; became the year&#x27;s third best-selling album in the United States, according to Nielsen Soundscan. It was certified 6× multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 23, 2007, and as of September 2017, it has sold over 6,355,000 copies in the United States, becoming her best-selling record in the region.

&quot;Breakaway&quot; has also enjoyed commercial success internationally; it became her first album to chart in over nineteen regions. By the end of 2005, the album became the world&#x27;s seventh best-selling release of the year according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In the United Kingdom, it debuted on the Official UK Albums Chart at number ten with 17,631 copies. At the beginning of 2006, the album ascended to number three on the chart. As of 2012, it has sold over 1,571,278 copies in the region. In Australia, &quot;Breakaway&quot; debuted on the ARIA Albums Chart at number twenty-nine, and also spent its entire year on the top fifty, peaking at number two. In Ireland, the album debuted on the IRMA Artist Albums chart at number twenty-one, and topped the chart in 2006. Together with the Australian Recording Industry Association, the Irish Recorded Music Association certified the record as 7× multi-platinum, its highest certification overall. In the Netherlands, the album debuted on the Mega Album Top 100 at number forty-seven and topped the chart for three weeks. Additionally, &quot;Breakaway&quot; peaked in the top five in the national charts of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, New Zealand, Portugal, and Switzerland; and has attained top twenty positions in six additional regions worldwide.

==Impact and legacy==
According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, as of 2022, &quot;Breakaway&quot; is one of the 15 best-performing 21st-century albums without any of its singles being number-one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

Music commercial analysts reported that Clarkson attained a commercial appeal on her own with &quot;Breakaway&quot;, despite their initial skepticism of her establishing prominence beyond &quot;American Idol&quot;. Clive Davis recalled that &quot;with the songs &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;, we were able to take Clarkson to a major seller of albums all over the world where they had never even heard of &quot;American Idol&quot;.&quot; According to Mediabase, which monitors radio station airplay in North America, Clarkson was the most played artist on the radio in 2006. David Corey, program director of WXKS-FM, described the feat as &quot;very rare&quot;. Just before the release of her third studio album, Davis also stated that she was one of the top four artists at Sony BMG. According to &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, &quot;the turning point for &quot;Idol&quot;″s credibility may have been the success of Clarkson&#x27;s sophomore album, released in 2004. While her first album, released soon after her win on &quot;Idol,&quot; was a platinum success, it only generated two hit singles and her success seemed tied into her newfound fame. But her hard-rocking second disc, which contained smashes like &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and the ballad &quot;Because of You&quot;, garnered her critical acclaim and made her a bonafide success apart from &quot;Idol&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; credits Clarkson for landscaping the core sound of mainstream pop music in the 2000s to an uptempo dance-oriented sound with the release of &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and the singles that followed it. The album&#x27;s producers also came into prominence due to the album&#x27;s success. Dr. Luke, who was the house band lead guitarist for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the time of &quot;Breakaway&quot;″s release, has credited &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; as his first big break. Max Martin, who had already found major success as a music producer in the 1990s and early 2000s with, among others, Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, achieved more prominence due to the success of &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; and &quot;Behind These Hazel Eyes&quot;.

&quot;Breakaway&quot;″s critical acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, particularly from the rock and indie music scene, who had looked down upon &quot;American Idol&quot; contestants. In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of &quot;Breakaway&quot; had validated &quot;American Idol&quot; itself. The popularity of &quot;Since U Been Gone&quot; among the rock community also resulted in various cover versions by rock acts, such as A Day to Remember, Ted Leo, and Tokyo Police Club. Clarkson herself recalled, &quot;It&#x27;s ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie people. I was walking around with a friend of mine and this hard-rock guy came up to me and was like, &#x27;I look stupid, but I tell my friends I love this song.&#x27; People at concerts are like, &#x27;That&#x27;s my guilty pleasure. I don&#x27;t mean to be mean, but I didn&#x27;t want to like the &quot;American Idol&quot; girl.&#x27; But they love that song, and it kind of won them over.&quot;

<text>Laker Airways was a private British airline founded by Sir Freddie Laker in 1966. It was originally a charter airline flying passengers and cargo worldwide. Its head office was located at Gatwick Airport in Crawley, England.

It became the second long-haul, low-cost, &quot;no frills&quot; airline in 1977, operating low-fare scheduled services between London Gatwick Airport and New York City&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Airport (after pioneering Icelandic low-cost carrier Loftleiðir). In the early 1980s, the company went into bankruptcy during the recession, operating its last flight on 5 February 1982.

==Early history==
Freddie Laker announced the creation of Laker Airways in February 1966. The airline commenced commercial operations from its Gatwick Airport base on 29 July 1966 with two former British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Bristol Britannia 102 series turboprops, initially operating under contract to Air France. The aircraft&#x27;s livery was a combination of black, red and white – an adaptation of Laker&#x27;s racing colours. The Britannias were supplemented and eventually replaced by five BAC One-Eleven 300 short-haul jet aircraft from December 1967. This included an initial 1966 order with the manufacturer for three aircraft valued at £4 million.

Laker spent more than £200,000 of his own money on the newly-ordered aircraft&#x27;s deposits, with a consortium of City banks led by Clydesdale Bank funding the remainder. He placed a follow-up order for a fourth aircraft to be delivered in 1968 and acquired a former-British Eagle aircraft from Bahamas Airways in 1971. These airline&#x27;s short- and medium-haul charter operations to holiday resorts in the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands were primarily operated with these aircraft.

==Operational history==
Laker Airways offered 30% discounts to tour operators to charter the airline&#x27;s aircraft during the winter, when demand was lower, and implemented other promotions to incentivise longer-term use of the aircraft by tour operators. This ensured that the fleet was in use for almost the entire year. 
August 1968 saw the establishment of its first overseas base at Tegel Airport in what was then West Berlin. The company had up to three BAC One-Elevens stationed there until 1981, when these aircraft were replaced with one of its three newly acquired Airbus A300 B4 series wide-bodies, at the time the largest aircraft operated out of any Berlin airport.

Its Berlin operation was staffed by ninety, mainly local, workers. Throughout this period, it carried thousands of holidaymakers from the Western parts of the then divided German capital to resorts in the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands.

===Ground handling===
In 1972, Laker Airways co-founded Gatwick Handling, a Gatwick handling agent that has become part of the Aviance group, with Dan-Air. Each airline owned 50% of Gatwick Handling at its inception.

====Climbing speed====
In the days when airports and air space were relatively uncongested, Laker Airways instructed departing One-Eleven crews to tune into other jet aircraft taking off ahead of them, and to begin a conversation with the other aircraft&#x27;s crew while continuing their climb. The aim was to obtain information about the other aircraft&#x27;s altitude to encourage that aircraft&#x27;s crew to climb to their upper cruising altitude as quickly as possible so that Laker&#x27;s One-Elevens could attain their optimum height in the shortest possible time. This helped Laker&#x27;s One-Elevens climb faster without using as much power, helping the company to reduce fuel consumption and reduce the engines&#x27; wear and tear.

====Weight-saving====
Among the weight-saving measures Laker Airways used to make its aircraft fly further without the need of refuelling was a baggage allowance limit of rather less than the more usual , and carrying fewer passengers than the aircraft could hold. This policy was first employed when the airline began operating its BAC One-Elevens. By limiting the free baggage allowance and restricting passengers, the company used the weight saved to carry additional fuel, increasing range.

This was sufficient to permit non-stop flights from London Gatwick or Berlin Tegel to Tenerife at least in one direction, depending on the direction and strength of the winds. This helped make Laker&#x27;s One-Elevens more competitive with larger, longer-range aircraft operated by rivals, especially for tour operators struggling to fill a bigger aircraft profitably. If the passenger load was greater than 70, the charterer paid for any stops, encouraging operators to keep to 70 passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eglin, R 1980, pp. 117/8&quot;&gt;&quot;Fly me, I&#x27;m Freddie!&quot;, Eglin, R. and Ritchie, B., Weidenfeld and Nicolson, London, 1980, pp. 117/8&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, weight saved as a result of limiting free baggage could be traded for reduced fuel consumption on shorter routes well within the BAC One-Eleven&#x27;s range by making the aircraft lighter, even with a full load of passengers.

====Introduction of DC-10 aircraft====

Weight-saving measures adopted to boost the BAC One-Eleven&#x27;s range stood Laker Airways in good stead when the airline introduced the McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10.

This model lacked the range of the DC-10-30. The DC-10-10 was optimised for medium-haul routes. The aircraft McDonnell Douglas was offering had been built against an order placed by Mitsui Group, for five aircraft, who intended to lease them to All Nippon Airways (ANA). But, instead, ANA decided to order the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar. Before offering, on behalf of Mitsui, the aircraft to Laker, McDonnell Douglas had asked British Caledonian (BCal) whether it was interested. BCal was looking for a widebody replacement for its ageing Boeing 707s and Vickers VC10s. BCal rejected this offer because the aircraft had insufficient range to fly non-stop from Gatwick to the distant points on its network.
Despite these drawbacks, Laker Airways took two of those five Mitsui (originally intended for ANA) ordered aircraft. The three remaining Mitsui aircraft went to Turkish Airlines. One of these later crashed as Turkish Airlines Flight 981. The airline concluded it could fly non-stop from the UK to any point east of the Rockies by keeping the baggage limit at and reducing single-class seating from 380 to 345. The saving could be used to carry more fuel. The calculations had shown that even with reduced seating, it had to fill only 52% of the seats to break even. Moreover, Laker Airways had figured that the aircraft&#x27;s low break-even seat factor would enable it to operate its proposed London – New York &quot;Skytrain&quot; with a lower break-even factor compared to the Boeing 707, an ageing narrow-bodied aircraft whose costs were higher per passenger. The DC-10s also had huge potential to boost the projected profitability of &quot;Skytrain&quot;. Revised estimates anticipated an average load factor of 70–75% and raised the traffic forecast for the first year of operation to 250,000 passengers each way. This was almost three times the original 707-based forecast. These factors swung the firm in favour of McDonnell-Douglas&#x27;s offer.

A Laker Airways McDonnell Douglas DC-10 series 10 was one of four widebodies that were specially flown in for the pre-inauguration of the then-new terminal building at Berlin&#x27;s Tegel Airport on 23 October 1974. (A British Airways (BA) Lockheed L-1011 Tristar 1, a Pan Am Boeing 747-100 and an Air France Airbus A300 B2 were the other widebodies specially flown in on that day to mark this occasion.)

=== Introduction of &quot;Skytrain&quot;===

The early 1970s saw the airline and its owner battle with aviation authorities in the UK and US to gain approval for a low-cost, &quot;no frills&quot; transatlantic service to link London and New York daily during the peak summer period from May to September and four times a week during the remainder of the year. This was to be marketed as &quot;Skytrain&quot; for £32.50 one-way in winter and £37.50 in summer. Two Boeing 707-138Bs were acquired from the administrators of British Eagle in 1969. Both were operated by Qantas when new.

They were subsequently purchased by Kleinwort Benson, which had leased them to British Eagle until its demise in November 1968. These aircraft were earmarked for &quot;Skytrain&quot;. Laker&#x27;s original &quot;Skytrain&quot; application assumed a 62.9% break-even load factor. This meant that the airline needed to sell 100 out of 158 seats at a single fare of £37.50 per seat on each flight to start making money with &quot;Skytrain&quot;. Sir Freddie announced &quot;Skytrain&quot; at a press conference at London&#x27;s Savoy Hotel on 30 June 1971.

Laker claimed that there was demand for this kind of service and maintained that it would grow the total number of passengers flying between Britain and the United States each year from 14m to 16m, rather than diverting other airlines&#x27; existing passengers.

Since approval for &quot;Skytrain&quot; was not forthcoming for several years, Laker Airways needed alternative work to keep its long-haul planes busy. Initially, both Boeing 707s supplemented the BAC One-Elevens on Mediterranean and Canary Islands routes, such as Gatwick – Palma de Mallorca and Gatwick–Tenerife. Both aircraft replaced Bristol Britannias on the airline&#x27;s long-haul flights, an increasing number of which were affinity group charters to North America, primarily the US.

During summer 1970, Laker sought the UK and Australian authorities&#x27; permission to operate a series of affinity group charter flights to Australia. Following his request&#x27;s refusal, he flew to Australia in early 1971 to discuss his proposal for 15-day inclusive tours from Australia to the UK, including full board at first class hotels for A$935, with the director-general of the Australian Department of Civil Aviation who doubled as Qantas&#x27;s chairman. Freddie Laker’s visit did not succeed in convincing the Australian authorities of his proposal&#x27;s merits as a result of lobbying from BOAC and Qantas, both of which were estimated to have lost £11 million in revenue due to competition from charter airlines on the Kangaroo route.

From December 1970, one of Laker&#x27;s two 707s was used for a once-a-week low-fare service linking Luxembourg with Barbados on behalf of International Caribbean Airways, a joint venture between Barbados businessmen Norman Ricketts and Geoffrey Edwards, who enjoyed the support of the Barbados government, and Laker Airways. Laker Airways initially held a 33% stake in International Caribbean. The aircraft Laker Airways allocated to International Caribbean Airways sported &quot;International Caribbean&quot; as well as the Barbadian flag on both sides of the forward fuselage in place of &quot;Laker&quot; and the Union Flag featured by the company&#x27;s other aircraft. In addition to the weekly Luxembourg–Barbados schedule, which subsequently became twice weekly and was extended to London Gatwick, this aircraft operated regular charters from Canada and West Germany to Barbados. In January 1975, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) designated International Caribbean Airways the flag carrier for Barbados.
Laker Airways had taken delivery of a fourth McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 series 10 widebodied jet in 1976 in preparation for the launch of its daily London to New York &quot;Skytrain&quot;. This aircraft was the DC-10&#x27;s second prototype, which the airline had acquired direct from MDC at a knock-down price. By that time, the work force had expanded to 1,000.

&quot;Skytrain&quot; was inaugurated between London Gatwick and New York JFK on 26 September 1977. It recorded a profit in excess of £2 million in its first year of operation.

In early 1979, the airline ordered a further two DC-10 series 10 widebodies as well as five longer range McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 series 30 widebodied aircraft.

Laker Airways expanded to Los Angeles (1978). The company acquired two-second-hand Boeing 707-351B narrow-bodied long-haul aircraft from Cathay Pacific to commence non-stop operations to the US West Coast prior to receiving the first of the McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 series 30 aircraft that were on order.

Following a public hearing, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) approved Laker&#x27;s request to operate unrestricted &quot;Skytrain&quot; services at the beginning of July 1979. This enabled the airline to offer bookable seats, excursion fares and the carriage of cargo in addition to the original, non-bookable &quot;Skytrain&quot; fare from Gatwick to New York JFK and Los Angeles.

With the arrival of the series 30 DC-10s, Intasun owner Harry Goodman recognised that long-haul charters to new destinations were now available and approached Laker with a number of possibilities from the Caribbean to Florida. Eventually, Goodman chose Florida and &quot;Disney World&quot; charters were introduced to the UK market. The programme rapidly expanded to seven times weekly and was eventually converted into a &quot;Skytrain&quot; operation to Miami.

By October 1980, Laker introduced fully bookable &quot;Super Economy&quot; fares on all &quot;Skytrain&quot; services. These were approximately half its competitors&#x27; standard economy fares and significantly lower than those airlines&#x27; &quot;Super APEX&quot; fares. The airline reserved about 60% of its scheduled seats for the new bookable fares. This move marked a major strategic shift in the company&#x27;s fare structure.

Tampa, Florida, was added in 1981 from Gatwick, Manchester and Prestwick, following lobbying from Bob Beckman&#x27;s client. By that time, the firm had sold both the older, shorter fuselage Boeing 707-138Bs and disposed of one BAC One-Eleven. This left it with 20 aircraft comprising 14 widebodies and six narrowbodies – 11 DC-10s, three A300s, two 707s and four One-Elevens, doubling the size within only five years. Over this period, the number working for Laker Airways and associated companies doubled again to 2,000.

During the 1981 summer period, Laker operated up to three daily frequencies each way between Gatwick and JFK and Gatwick and Miami as well as twice daily round-trips between Gatwick and Los Angeles. This made Laker the fourth biggest transatlantic scheduled airline between the UK and US as well as fifth biggest overall. By that time, the airline had carried over two million &quot;Skytrain&quot; passengers.

===Widebody era===
In November 1972, Laker Airways became the first airline outside North America to operate the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 widebody when it took delivery of a pair of new series 10 aircraft from McDonnell Douglas Corporation&#x27;s (MDC) factory in Long Beach, California, via Japanese lessor Mitsui.

===Simplified charter rules===
On 1 April 1973, new charter regulations in the UK, the US and Canada replaced the complicated &quot;affinity group&quot; rules with simplified rules termed &quot;Advance Booking Charters&quot;, popularly known as ABC. The following day, a Laker Airways McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 flew the world&#x27;s inaugural ABC flight from Manchester to Toronto. Laker&#x27;s first ABC passengers had paid £45 round-trip. The inaugural flight was operated under contract to Laker&#x27;s Liverpool-based in-house package tour operator Arrowsmith Holidays, a group company since 1967. It was followed by similar ABC services from Prestwick and a three-times-a-week Gatwick–Toronto ABC operation. The latter was operated under contract to Lord Brothers, the airline&#x27;s London-based in-house tour operator that had been part of the group since 1968 and changed its name to Laker Air Travel in 1974.

A third DC-10 series 10 widebody joined the fleet in April 1974 to maintain the airline&#x27;s commitments in the ABC flights market. (Laker intended to allocate two DC-10s exclusively to &quot;Skytrain&quot; in anticipation of the start of daily services between Stansted and Newark later that year. This aircraft was eventually used to meet growing ABC commitments.)

The new ABC rules enabled Sir Freddie to build a successful ABC flights business across the North Atlantic over the next couple of years, making Laker Airways the market leader in transatlantic ABC flights. During the early to mid-1970s, the airline ran low-key advertising on hoardings and public transport in London, Manchester and other large British cities under the motto &quot;Take a Laker&quot;.

Laker&#x27;s transatlantic charters provided meals, movies (at the time, a new amenity), and a free bar.

The success of Laker Airways&#x27;s transatlantic ABC flights resulted in an application to launch an Australian low-fare operation from Gatwick and/or Luxembourg to Sydney and Melbourne. Laker&#x27;s application was dismissed by Peter Nixon, the Australian Transport Minister. Nixon stated that the UK–Australia scheduled air services market was to remain the preserve of BA and Qantas. This decision was the result of successful lobbying by Qantas, which had exerted pressure on its government to protect the long-established duopoly it shared with British Airways on the Kangaroo route under a joint revenue-sharing agreement. Nixon also maintained that the proposed service to only two Australian points would be discriminatory on people living in other parts of the country by denying them the benefits of low fares. These comments prompted Sir Freddie to retort that the Australian transport minister still thought the earth was flat, and that it had not come to his attention that Australia already had a number of regional airlines covering the whole of the country.

An advertising campaign featuring the slogan &quot;I&#x27;ve got my name on every plane!&quot; was developed in conjunction with a New York-based company. It was successfully launched during the Super Bowl VIII interval in January 1974. &quot;Laker to London – the end of Skyway robbery&quot; was the follow-on campaign. The success of these campaigns resulted in Laker carrying more non-scheduled UK–US passengers than all US carriers combined.

Despite attaining market leadership in the transatlantic ABC market, Sir Freddie considered this second best in the absence of his &quot;Skytrain&quot; service.

===Attempts to expand &quot;Skytrain&quot;===

====Plans for a new low-fare Australian service====
In 1980, Laker Airways withdrew its application to run ABC flights to Australia. Instead, the airline proposed a scheduled low-fare service from London Gatwick with one stop. It was to be one flight a day in each direction using the airline&#x27;s five DC-10-30 widebodies. In contrast to &quot;Skytrain&quot;, this was to feature a first class section called &quot;Pullman&quot;. It was to operate three flights per week each to Sydney and Melbourne respectively, and one to Perth.

The CAA took a negative view of Laker&#x27;s application for a UK–Australia scheduled low-fare service and a rival application by BCal to launch a conventional, scheduled service between Gatwick and four Australian destinations via Colombo at four flights a week each way. It considered Laker&#x27;s market growth forecast overoptimistic, its stimulation factors unreal, and its fares intentions vague. In the CAA&#x27;s opinion, the Australians were unlikely to accept another UK airline without a reciprocal service from a second Australian carrier, and the traffic on the UK–Australia route would not support two additional carriers without a substantial reduction in service frequencies of the incumbent operators. (The CAA told BCal that it considered its proposal for a new, faster service to Australia superior to Laker&#x27;s, and that it would therefore look favourably on its application if it wished to re-apply with specific proposals for a joint Anglo-Australian operation.)

====Second designated UK carrier to Hong Kong====
The UK government decided in 1979 to open the route between London and Hong Kong to competition. This was to be by a second British scheduled carrier to ease the shortage of seats passengers were experiencing at peak times on the ten-times-a-week monopoly service by BA from Heathrow.

A race ensued when BCal, Laker and Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong&#x27;s de facto &quot;flag carrier&quot;, filed their applications with the CAA in London.

Laker proposed a daily &quot;Skytrain&quot; linking Gatwick and Hong Kong via Sharjah to be operated with single-class, 380-seat McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30s. At the CAA hearing the airline proposed larger, higher capacity Boeing 747s as soon as this was justified by increased demand. The company tried to convince the CAA that its additional all-economy class discount service was the best option to alleviate the shortage of seats on this route. Its analysis showed the bottom end of the economy market was the most under-served segment because of the scarcity of low fares. The other airlines used Laker&#x27;s analysis in support of their claims that &quot;Skytrain&quot; would flood the market with cheap seats that risked undermining profitability without doing anything to alleviate the shortage of premium seats. Laker retorted that low fares would stimulate the market by meeting untapped demand from people who could not afford to fly this route because of BA&#x27;s high fares, rather than taking market share from competitors. It pointed to the success of its transatlantic &quot;Skytrain&quot; in helping create demand while maintaining that its rivals&#x27; proposals would do little to meet the unsatisfied demand for low-fare seats.

The CAA awarded a licence to operate unlimited scheduled services between London and Hong Kong to BCal, which had proposed running a conventional service from Gatwick via Dubai, using its growing fleet of McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 widebodies in a three-class configuration featuring a first and an executive class in addition to economy. BCal had also agreed to offer a number of low fares that would match the lowest fares Laker had proposed. The CAA rejected Cathay Pacific&#x27;s and Laker&#x27;s applications, clearing the way for BCal to become the second British scheduled carrier on that route.

However, Hong Kong&#x27;s Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) refused to endorse BCal because many felt upset that Cathay Pacific was excluded from one of the world&#x27;s most lucrative routes. This caused a row between the UK and Hong Kong governments. Cathay Pacific began lobbying in the Crown colony as well as in the UK, stressing it had invested millions in the British economy at a time of high unemployment in the UK by placing large orders for Rolls-Royce RB211-powered Boeing 747s. The UK government allowed Cathay Pacific to join Laker in appealing to John Nott, the UK Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, against the CAA&#x27;s award of a licence exclusively to BCal. The Secretary of State overturned the CAA&#x27;s decision and opened the route to all three airlines without placing restrictions on frequencies of service. For Laker Airways this turned out to be a partial victory because the ATLA continued to refuse a reciprocal permit, without which Laker&#x27;s service remained grounded.

Cathay Pacific commenced a thrice-weekly service between Hong Kong and London Gatwick via Bahrain on 17 July 1980 using a Rolls-Royce RB211-powered Boeing 747-200B ahead of BCal, which began a four-times-a-week London Gatwick – Hong Kong service via Dubai on 1 August 1980 using a McDonnell-Douglas DC-10-30.

====&quot;Globetrain&quot;====
Laker Airways planned to link its Gatwick – Los Angeles &quot;Skytrain&quot; with the proposed Gatwick – Hong Kong &quot;Skytrain&quot; across the Pacific via Honolulu and Tokyo to create the first daily round-the-world through service by a British airline in both directions. This was to be marketed under the trademark &quot;Globetrain&quot;.

Cathay Pacific was among airlines attacking Laker&#x27;s plans. The established transpacific airlines were concerned that Laker was likely to create excess capacity, threatening the profitability as well as long-term viability of these routes. Sir Freddie said Cathay seemed concerned about sharing the Hong Kong – Tokyo route with a competitor because this route was the main source of profits for Cathay Pacific&#x27;s Asian and transpacific operation.

Laker abandoned &quot;Globetrain&quot; due to its inability to obtain regulatory approvals.

====Proposed &quot;Skytrain&quot; routes to Europe====

In September 1978, Laker Airways became the UK launch customer for the twin-engined Airbus A300, short and medium-haul widebodied jet. The airline ordered 10 series B4 aircraft in a 314-seat single-class configuration to serve a network of up to 666 European &quot;Skytrain&quot; routes. The majority of the low-fare network was not going to touch the UK, making it the first pan-European commercial airline.

Laker&#x27;s European Skytrain plans were opposed by BCal, which was keen to expand its European network beyond routes linking Gatwick with Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam, Brussels and Genoa. BCal needed to develop its connecting traffic at Gatwick by growing the European network to include Germany, Switzerland, Scandinavia and Southern Europe to help it increase loads on flights to Africa, South America and the US as well as improve profitability. BCal came up with its own proposal, &quot;Miniprix&quot;, to counter Laker. This alternative was less ambitious than Laker&#x27;s. Excluding BCal&#x27;s existing four European routes, it envisaged linking Gatwick with 20 additional points on the continent. Services were to be operated during off-peak times with BAC One-Eleven 500s and Boeing 707-320Cs. BCal was considering both the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 narrowbody as well as the Airbus A310 widebody as long-term replacements for its existing narrow-bodied aircraft on these proposed routes.

Dan-Air and Britannia Airways, the UK&#x27;s leading charter airlines, feared that without reciprocal foreign regulatory approvals Laker would be forced to dump this additional widebody capacity on the European charter market, creating excess capacity that would collapse charter rates.

The CAA heard Laker&#x27;s as well as BCal&#x27;s and other UK independent airlines&#x27; proposals. It rejected Laker. It subsequently awarded two scheduled licences to Laker Airways, one for Gatwick – Berlin Tegel and the other for Gatwick–Zürich, following British Airways&#x27;s decision to abandon short-haul routes it had been operating from Gatwick at low frequencies since the late 1970s and to surrender unused licences to the CAA. By the time the CAA awarded Laker these licences, the airline was experiencing financial difficulties and had to dispose of three A300 widebodies to cut costs by reducing the number of aircraft types as well as its overall size. Laker Airways intended to commence operations on both routes during the spring of 1982, operating two flights a day each way using spare capacity on its remaining BAC One-Elevens. The airline ceased to exist before the inaugural date.

Laker introduced a short-lived scheduled service between Manchester and Zürich during 1981, which it operated at one flight per day in each direction using a newly delivered A300 widebody. This route, the airline&#x27;s only short-haul scheduled operation, had come about after British Airways&#x27;s decision to abandon its loss-making Manchester–Zürich services. Laker&#x27;s application to have BA&#x27;s licence transferred to itself resulted in its becoming the UK flag carrier between Manchester and Zürich. The airline&#x27;s subsequent withdrawal and its demise in turn resulted in Dan-Air becoming the UK flag carrier between Manchester and Zürich.

BCal began offering &quot;Miniprix&quot; fares on off-peak services on Gatwick–Amsterdam after it had obtained approval from the UK authorities and their Dutch counterparts.

====Additional &quot;Skytrain&quot; routes to the United States====
Laker Airways sought to strengthen its position as a transatlantic airline by applying to the CAA and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) for licences to serve additional US cities under the Bermuda II UK-US accord. Both the CAA and the CAB approved the application to commence daily &quot;Skytrain&quot; services from Gatwick, Manchester and Prestwick to Chicago, Detroit, Oakland, Seattle and Washington DC. The company did not have aircraft to use these licences immediately. Its deteriorating financial position did not let it add more aircraft. By the time Laker Airways went out of business, those licences remained unused. They were eventually allocated to other airlines.

==Bankruptcy==
Laker Airways did not have the financial strength to survive the early 1980s recession and competition by the established scheduled airlines. Swiss aviation enthusiasts&#x27; magazine &quot;Interavia&quot; had reported in a 1978 issue that Laker&#x27;s issued share capital was £10,000. As per the airline&#x27;s 1980 balance sheet, the paid-up share capital was £504,000. These figures compared unfavourably with BCal and British Airways, whose issued share capital stood at £12 million and £100 million respectively.

As long ago as June 1971, when &quot;Skytrain&quot; was first announced, it was revealed that Laker Airways had net assets of £1.68 million and tax equalisation reserves of £450,000. Although this amounted to over £2 million, it could not disguise the fact that Laker Airways was a financial minnow compared with most of the established flag carriers and BCal.

The weak financial position was underlined by the fact that 90 per cent of the share capital was held by Freddie Laker and the remainder by Joan Laker, a former spouse, while Laker Airways was a subsidiary of Laker Airways (Leasing), which in turn was a subsidiary of Jersey-incorporated Laker Airways (International). This had served the firm well since it allowed it to take advantage of lower taxes and more employer-friendly labour legislation in the Channel Islands. However, the fact that the airline&#x27;s ultimate holding company was in an off-shore tax haven outside the jurisdiction of UK law increased lenders&#x27; risk to get their money back.

In addition to undercapitalisation, unsustainably high debts and weak finances, Laker Airways was not backed by any significant assets. The bulk of its fleet was leased, as was the maintenance hangar at Gatwick that also housed the airline&#x27;s offices. The only financial backup that Laker Airways had was Freddie Laker&#x27;s&#x27;s stud farm and his personal wealth.

===Economic climate===
Both the UK and US were in recession in the early 1980s, characterised by negative/low growth, high unemployment, high inflation and high interest rates. During that period the company was expanding to sustain commercial success generally and that of &quot;Skytrain&quot; in particular. Laker Airways needed to position itself to take advantage of additional opportunities to expand its business to maintain its status as Britain&#x27;s second largest independent airline and third principal long-haul operator. Eventually, the company borrowed at high interest rates. The high interest rates were a major cause for the increase in the firm&#x27;s borrowing costs as well as its debts.

Although the Laker Airways fleet contained a greater proportion of modern widebodied aircraft than most of its competitors, which made it cheaper to operate and maintain, the airline felt the sudden tripling of the price of crude oil in the aftermath of the Shah of Iran&#x27;s fall from power. Laker Airways needed to pay the high spot market oil prices because it could not hedge its future supplies by negotiating fixed-rate, forward purchases. Such financial derivatives were non-existent.

The airline attempted to protect itself against sterling-dollar exchange rate fluctuations by buying US dollars at a fixed rate. This was a necessity as most of its costs were in dollars whereas most of its income was in pounds sterling. The company&#x27;s growing problems were exacerbated by wrongly anticipating the sterling-dollar exchange rate for the 1981/2 winter season. During all 1980 and the better part of 1981 the rate was 1:2. The pound could buy two dollars because sterling was kept high by Britain&#x27;s North Sea oil exports and the importance these exports assumed against high crude oil prices. Laker Airways did not anticipate the speed of sterling&#x27;s subsequent decline. This meant that it needed to pay more for dollars than it had originally budgeted, leading to an outflow of funds at a time of financial crisis.

===Demise===
The &quot;Skytrain&quot; concept was flawed, as it required high year-round loads to make money at discount prices, even though Laker Airways had lower costs and a simpler organisation.

The airline began to fail when Pan Am, a transatlantic competitor, decided in October 1981 to drop its lowest economy fares where it was in competition with &quot;Skytrain&quot; by up to 66%. Laker retaliated by introducing a discounted premium cabin branded &quot;Regency Class&quot;. Following the end of the 1981/2 winter peak, there was insufficient traffic to support four airlines competing across the North Atlantic between January and March. At this point, state-owned British Airways and TWA, Laker&#x27;s other transatlantic competitors, dropped their fares by a similar amount. As a result, Laker&#x27;s loads and cash inflow halved between October 1981 and February 1982. It has also been suggested that Laker experienced a downturn after passengers began avoiding the DC-10 due to the series of high-profile fatal accidents that befell the type at the end of the 1970s.

The final blow to Laker Airways came when British Caledonian (BCal) and other European operators of the DC-10 warned McDonnell Douglas and GE that if the companies moved forward with a rescue contract with Laker, they would cease all business with those companies. McDonnell Douglas and GE did not proceed with the rescue, and Laker Airways collapsed in the early morning of 5 February 1982 with debts of £270 million, the largest corporate failure in Britain.

Freddie Laker sued IATA member airlines British Airways, BCal, Pan Am, TWA, Lufthansa, Air France, Swissair, KLM, SAS, Sabena, Alitalia and UTA for conspiracy to put his airline out of business by predatory pricing. They settled out of court for US$50 million. BA reached a separate out-of-court agreement with Freddie Laker personally for £8 million.

In July 1985, BA agreed to contribute an additional $35 million on top of its earlier out-of-court agreement with Freddie Laker. The total amount contributed by all parties enabled Laker to pay off his outstanding debts of $69 million, permitted BA to proceed with its own privatisation, and saved the other airlines from potential bankruptcy.

Following Laker&#x27;s demise, its former fleet was quickly re-allocated to other operators. These included two DC-10-10 widebodies that joined the fleet of British Caledonian Charter (BCal&#x27;s charter division), four BAC One-Eleven 300 narrow-bodies BCal&#x27;s seven One-Eleven 200s, and two Airbus A300B4 widebodies that were placed with Air Jamaica.

==Incidents and accidents==

On 17 August 1969, a BAC One-Eleven 320L (registration: G-AVBX) operating a charter flight from Klagenfurt, Austria, to Berlin Tegel, Germany, under contract to West Berlin package holiday company Flug-Union Berlin. The aircraft made an emergency landing at Hanover Airport because of an electrical fire in an aerial tuning unit in the forward cabin area behind the flight deck. The fire started when the aircraft was from Hanover, filling the cabin with fumes. This reduced visibility on the flight deck to . Forward vision was nil.

Using the emergency oxygen system, the captain began his emergency descent from FL250 under radar guidance from Hanover air traffic control (ATC), while the co-pilot depressurised the aircraft and attempted to open a side window to clear the smoke. The cabin crew were deprived of both their public address system and intercom with the flight deck during the descent. Due to lack of time before landing, emergency procedures were abandoned. Following the successful emergency landing, the aircraft came to a rapid halt clear of the runway. By the time the last of the 89 occupants (5 crew and 84 passengers) had evacuated the aircraft, the fire had burned through the pressure hull and was being fed by oxygen. There were no injuries. The fire was extinguished on the ground. Following the incident, the aircraft manufacturer issued several service bulletins (SBs) listing action to be taken as mandated by the UK&#x27;s Airworthiness Requirements Board (ARB). These SBs were circulated to all One-Eleven operators. The ARB also issued a more general warning to all One-Eleven operators regarding the need to ensure that oxygen leaks do not create fire hazards, and that oxygen lines are routed away from potential fire sources.

As a result of this incident, the ARB also began to pay close attention to the fire resistance of aircraft fittings and furnishings due to their potential to form major hazards in oxygen-fed inflight fires. The flight deck crew, Captain Basil Bradshaw and First Officer Bernard Sedgwick, subsequently received the Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air, while the cabin crew were commended for their action during the emergency. The citation for the Queen&#x27;s Award stated that &quot;the crew displayed a high standard of airmanship in circumstances which could have had very serious consequences&quot;.

==Other Laker Airways operations==
* Laker Airways was an airline based in the Bahamas to which Sir Freddie Laker lent his name and operational expertise. The airline was established in 1992 with financial assistance from Oscar Wyatt, a Texas oilman and business partner of Sir Freddie Laker. The fleet comprised two Boeing 727-200 Advanced narrow-bodied jet aircraft. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in 1994 the airline was operating scheduled nonstop service between Freeport, Bahamas and Baltimore, Maryland, Birmingham, Alabama, Chicago, Illinois (via Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport), Cincinnati, Ohio, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Greenville, South Carolina, Memphis, Tennessee, Raleigh, North Carolina, Richmond, Virginia and West Palm Beach, Florida. By 1995, the OAG listed nonstop Laker service between Freeport and these same US cities with the exception of Birmingham, Greenville and Memphis with new nonstop flights being operated between Freeport and Cleveland, Ohio and Hartford, Connecticut. Laker Airways (Bahamas) was wound up in 2005.
* Laker Airways, Inc was a US-registered airline Sir Freddie Laker co-owned with Oscar Wyatt. The company commenced operations in April 1996 with a leased fleet of four McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 widebodied jets and 300 employees. Twice-weekly low-fare, high-quality scheduled services linking Fort Lauderdale in Florida with London Gatwick were inaugurated on 5 July 1996, followed by similar services linking Orlando with Manchester and Glasgow Prestwick. These flights featured an executive class with leather seats, seat back TVs and inflight catering marketed as &quot;Regency Class Service&quot;. A daily Miami–Gatwick service was to start in March 1997. Laker Airways, Inc ceased operations in 1998.
* Laker Airways Limited was incorporated as a Company in England and Wales in June 2013 and was a division of a larger aviation training, recruitment and consultancy firm. The company was registered at offices near to Liverpool John Lennon Airport. The company was dissolved on 9 September 2014 .

==Fleet==

Laker operated the following aircraft types at various times over the years:

* Airbus A300B4
* Boeing 707 (series −138B and −351B models)
* Boeing 727-200 Advanced (Laker Airways Bahamas operation)
* British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven (series −300 and −400 models)
* Bristol Britannia (series −102 model)
* McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10
* McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30
* Vickers VC10 (leased to Middle East Airlines and not operated by Laker Airways)

==Legacy==
Unlike Laker, the vast majority of low-cost airlines have limited themselves to short and midrange flights and shunned the long range market. Almost all attempts to enter the long range market with a low cost model have ended within a couple of years in either withdrawal or bankruptcy.

Sir Freddie Laker was an influence for Sir Richard Branson and his establishment of Virgin Atlantic.

At London Southend Airport is the &quot;Lakers bar &amp; restaurant&quot;, named after the airline.

<doc id="1254209" wikidata="Q13427061" url="?curid=1254209" title="2004 South American Summit">
<text>The 2004 South American Summit – the third of its kind, after earlier events in Brasília (September 2000) and Guayaquil (July 2002) – was held in Cuzco and Ayacucho, Peru, on 7 –9 December 2004. Officially it constituted the Extraordinary Meeting of the Andean Presidential Council (&quot;Reunión Extraordinaria del Consejo Presidencial Andino&quot; ) and was also billed as the Third Meeting of Presidents of South America (&quot;III Reunión de Presidentes de América del Sur&quot;).

The main item on the agenda was the signature, by heads of state and plenipotentiary representatives of 12 South American nations, of the Cuzco Declaration, a two-page document containing a preamble to the deed of foundation of the South American Community of Nations (or &quot;South American Union&quot;), uniting the region&#x27;s two existing free-trade organisations – Mercosur and the Andean Community. 

Ayacucho was chosen for symbolic reasons: it was there that Antonio José de Sucre, fighting under the banner of Simón Bolívar &quot;the Liberator&quot;, defeated the last Imperial Spanish troops in South America on 9 December 1824.

While the organisation&#x27;s exact nature and functions – and even its name – remain unclear, it aspires to evolve along the lines followed by the continental integration efforts of the European Union, rather than becoming a mere free-trade area. The initiative emerged – largely at the instigation of Brazil – in response to the failed negotiations of the Free Trade Area of the Americas. The FTAA process has been stalemated for more than 12 months in the wake of irreconcilable differences, largely along the geopolitical faultlines between Latin America and the Caribbean on the one hand and the United States and Canada on the other.

<text>Oba Sir Titus Martins Adesoji Tadeniawo Aderemi (Atobatele I), alias Adesoji Aderemi (15 November 1889 – 3 July 1980), was a Nigerian political figure and Yoruba traditional ruler as the Ooni (King) of Ife (or &quot;Ilé-Ifẹ̀&quot;, as it is properly known) from 1930 until 1980. He served as the governor of Western Region, Nigeria between 1960 and 1962.

Adesoji Aderemi was known as a wealthy man and had a large family of many wives and children. One of his children was the civil servant Tejumade Alakija.

During the colonial era, the Oba Ooni gained a considerable amount of power due to the colonial policy of indirect rule and being labelled a first class Oba among traditional rulers in Yorubaland. The policy of indirect rule was used to ensure native awareness and consultations about colonial policies affecting the regions. The British leaned on existing native political structures and hierarchy, particularly the Nigerian traditional rulers, for political consultation and tax collection. Later on, the Ooni with the consent of the leading Yoruba political leaders used his position to close the gaps of exploitation of divisional differences among Yorubas and tried fervently to rally the Yoruba towards a common goal.

In 1962, the king acting as governor, used his power to remove the premier of the region, sensing the premier did not have the support of the majority members of the House of Assembly. The event escalated the political rivalries in the region.

==Early life==

He was born on 15 November 1889, during the turbulence of the Yoruba civil war to Prince Osundeyi Gbadebo of the Osinkola ruling house of Ile Ife and Madam Adekunbi Itiola of Ipetumodu, (she was his 19th and youngest wife). In the absence of his warrior father, who was on a war expedition; he was named Adesoji Aderemi, meaning &quot;The crown has woken up,&quot; and &quot;The crown consoles me,&quot; respectively. 

On Prince Gbadebo&#x27;s return, Adesoji&#x27;s older sister Ibiyemi, unable to contain her excitement of the news, had to be held back from initial physical contact with her war-weary and juju laden father. Until he had rid himself of his protective war attire by appeasing his gods, then was it safe to embrace his family.

Prince Gbadebo being an Ifa priest, presented his newborn to his Ifa Oracle demanding to know what the future holds for the new baby Aderemi. The father was told to bow to his son. The Ifa predicted that baby Aderemi, was going to wear the crown of his ancestors, that his reign will be known far and wide, and he will come in contact with strangers in far away places.

Prince Gbadebo told his wife to get coral beads to dress his son as was customary for royalty. In the belief of the oracle, mother-Adekunbi went into protective mode, always washing Aderemi in herbs, until he outgrew her methods. His father died in 1897 when he was 8 years old. Having lost his father at an early age, he was raised by his mother. The emergence of Christianity dissuaded his mother from the traditional family worship of Ifa, hence his enrollment at the new local Christian primary school of St Phillips, Ife, as one of the first students in Ife to attend a local school in 1901.

The young Prince Aderemi had a vision. His objection to farming with his much older and beloved brothers, Papa Prince Adeyemo and Prince Samuel Adewuyi [Sooko Laekun], led to his enrollment at the Anglican primary school at Aiyetoro, Ile-Ife.

==Ooni of Ife: 1930–1980==

Prince Aderemi&#x27;s wealth and exposure made him the clear candidate to rise to the throne of Ile-Ife. Upon the death of Oba Ademiluyi, his predecessor, he became the outstanding contestant for the throne.

On the 2nd of September, he became the 49th Ooni of Ife. He was widely dubbed the first literate Ooni. Oba Aderemi quickly acclimatised himself to his new environment, at 40, he was the youngest of the Yoruba Obas at the time. Oba Aderemi with the aid of the traditional Ife elders, (Obalufe, Obajio, Obaloran, Wasin, Obalaye, Akogun, Jagunosin, Ejesi), formed the administrative set up that transformed the ancient town in the next decade. Oba Aderemi championed Education during his reign as Ooni, which was the sentiment behind the foundation of Oduduwa College in January 1932. Oba Aderemi personally funded the construction of the Secondary School, a model institution at the time; Oba Aderemi believed that the surest way to facilitate and sustain modernisation is through education.

A great landmark of his reign pertaining education was the foundation of the University of Ife, which many attributed to Oba Aderemi&#x27;s influence in the ruling Government, with the Ooni tenaciously proposing Ife as the ideal location for the foremost institution to be situated. Oba Aderemi constructed the main building of his palace, which remains a mainstay of the Ife palace to date - with its unique colonial-style. Ooni Aderemi served as the permanent chairman of the council of Obas from 1966 to 1980.

His reign as Ooni was remarkably peaceful, with his innovative ideas in business creating a pathway to wealth for a lot of indigenes, especially in the agriculture industry, where he was a business leader himself.

<doc id="1254241" wikidata="Q6466470" url="?curid=1254241" title="La vache qui pleure (album)">
<text>La vache qui pleure is the ninth album by Kate &amp; Anna McGarrigle, released in 2003. It is named after the prehistoric bas-relief (stone carving) of La vache qui pleure near Djanet in the south of Algeria which is pictured on the album cover. Its title &quot;La vache qui pleure&quot; (French for &quot;The crying cow&quot;) may also be a joke with the famous French cheese label &quot;La vache qui rit&quot; (&quot;The laughing cow&quot;).

It is the sisters&#x27; second full album of French songs, following on from their 1980 album &quot;Entre Lajeunesse et la sagesse&quot;, while several of their other albums also included a few French songs.

The album does include one English song, &quot;Sunflower&quot;, which is a setting of William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;Ah! Sunflower&quot;. The same song is performed in French (&quot;Ah tournesol&quot;), as a straight translation of the original. Blake&#x27;s poem is not acknowledged in the credits for either song.

Guest musicians on the album include Joel Zifkin, Lily Lanken (Anna&#x27;s daughter), and Martha Wainwright (Kate&#x27;s daughter).

In 2005, the album was given a European release on the Munich label, and a twelfth track, &quot;La complainte du phoque en Alaska&quot; which was written originally by Michel Rivard for Beau Dommage a Montreal based band, was added. That version is currently out of print.

==Critical reception==
Brendan Kelly, reviewer for &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, wrote on November 22, 2003:
&quot;La Vache qui pleure, like most McGarrigles albums, feels like it exists out of time. Some songs sound like they could have been recorded in the 1940s or yesterday.&quot;

In his review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on April 15, 2005, Robin Denselow wrote:
&quot;This new set, with all but one song in French, is a nod to their French-Canadian roots. Kate plays guitars, banjo, piano and violin, Anna adds accordion and the occasional dash of synthesizer, and Martha helps out on harmonies. The production is more gutsy than in the past, the singing and playing are fine as ever, and the songs range from the thoughtful Ce Matin to Petites Boîtes, an unexpectedly refreshing reworking of the well-worn Little Boxes, the Malvina Reynolds song made famous by Pete Seeger.&quot;

Also on April 15, 2005, Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote:
&quot;Presumably named in opposition to the synthetic connotations of the French processed cheese, La Vache Qui Pleure (Crying Cow) features folksy arrangements of Acadian fiddles, accordions and banjos, with the sisters&#x27; harmonies adding an Enya-esque gossamer quality to tracks such as &quot;Petite Annonce Amoureuse&quot; and &quot;Sunflower (Ah Tournesol)&quot;, where the swelling and subsiding of the backing instruments is like the lapping of an ocean on a distant beach. There&#x27;s a keen awareness of the plight of powerless outsiders, be they the homesick refugee of &quot;Ce Matin&quot;, the natives of Michel Rivard&#x27;s &quot;La Complainte du Phoque en Alaska&quot;, lamenting the way their youngsters leave for the US, or the cow of the title-track, weeping for her lost calf. Most quirkily enjoyable is the reading of Malvina Reynolds&#x27; folk standard &quot;Little Boxes (Petites Boites)&quot;, rendered as a lolloping cajun waltz of fiddle, accordion and guitars.&quot;

<text>La Psychologie de l&#x27;Art (&quot;The Psychology of Art&quot;) is a work of art history by André Malraux. The book offers an explication of Malraux&#x27;s philosophy of art &quot;via&quot; the history of Western painting.

It was originally published in three volumes: &quot;The Imaginary Museum&quot; (1947); &quot;The Artistic Creation&quot; (1948); and &quot;Aftermath of the Absolute&quot; (1949). In 1953 a revised, single-volume edition was published as &quot;The Voices of Silence&quot;. Stuart Gilbert translated all four books into English.

In France, Malraux&#x27;s works of art history were touchstones of their time and exerted a major influence on (for example) Jean-Luc Godard in his own work of critical art history, &quot;Histoire(s) du cinéma&quot;.

<doc id="1254248" wikidata="Q2660878" url="?curid=1254248" title="Jacob Pavlovich Adler">
<text>Jacob Pavlovich Adler (Yiddish: יעקבֿ פּאַװלאָװיטש אַדלער; born Yankev P. Adler; February 12, 1855 – April 1, 1926) was a Jewish actor and star of Yiddish theater, first in Odessa, and later in London and in New York City&#x27;s Yiddish Theater District.

Nicknamed &quot;nesher hagodol&quot;, (&quot;the Great Eagle&quot;, &quot;Adler&quot; being the German for &quot;eagle&quot;), he achieved his first theatrical success in Odessa, but his career there was rapidly cut short when Yiddish theater was banned in Russia in 1883. He became a star in Yiddish theater in London, and in 1889, on his second voyage to the United States, he settled in New York City. Adler soon started a company of his own, ushering in a new, more serious Yiddish theater, most notably by recruiting the Yiddish theater&#x27;s first realistic playwright, Jacob Gordin. Adler scored a great triumph in the title role of Gordin&#x27;s &quot;Der Yiddisher King Lear&quot; (&quot;The Jewish King Lear&quot;), set in 19th-century Russia, which along with his portrayal of Shakespeare&#x27;s Shylock would form the core of the persona he defined as the &quot;Grand Jew&quot;.

Nearly all his family went into theater; probably the most famous was his daughter Stella, who taught method acting to, among others, Marlon Brando.

==Childhood and youth==
Adler was born in Odessa, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). Adler&#x27;s father, Feivel (Pavel) Abramovitch Adler, was a (rather unsuccessful) grain merchant. His mother, née Hessye Halperin, was a tall, beautiful woman, originally from a wealthy family in Berdichev. She became estranged from her family after divorcing her first husband (and leaving behind a son) to marry Adler&#x27;s father. The marriage to a divorcée cost Feivel Adler (and therefore Jacob Adler) his status as a Kohen (priest). His paternal grandfather lived with them for some eight years; he was a pious man, and the family was much more observant of Jewish religious practices during the time he lived with them. However, according to Adler, the real patriarch of the family was his wealthy uncle Aaron &quot;Arke&quot; Trachtenberg, who would later be the model for his portrayal of roles such as Gordin&#x27;s Jewish King Lear.

Adler grew up with one foot in a traditional Jewish world and one in a more modern, European one. His granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld writes, &quot;Of the haskala [Jewish Enlightenment] as an organized system of ideas, he probably knew little or nothing.&quot; His education was irregular: as the family fortunes rose and fell, he would be sent to &quot;cheder&quot; (Jewish religious school) or to a Russian language county school, pulled out of school entirely, or have a private tutor for a few months. He wrote that &quot;the sum of my learning was a little arithmetic, some Russian grammar, and a few French phrases.&quot;

He grew up with both Jewish and Christian playmates, but also survived one of the Odessa pogroms around 1862. He played hooky; as a 12-year-old he started going to witness public floggings, brandings, and executions of criminals; later he would develop more of an interest in attending courtroom trials. At 14 he began working in a textile factory, and soon rose to a white collar job there at a salary of 10 rubles a month, which would have been decent even for an adult. Still living at home, he began to frequent the disreputable district of Moldovanka. His first brush with stardom was that he briefly became a boxer, known as &quot;Yankele Kulachnik&quot;, &quot;Jake the Fist&quot;. He soon got bored with boxing, but not with his new connections to the &quot;sons of rich fathers, attorneys without diplomas&quot;, etc. A good dancer, he became part of a crowd of young toughs who regularly crashed wedding parties. His local celebrity continued, with a reputation as Odessa&#x27;s best can-can dancer.

He left the factory, becoming a &quot;raznoschik&quot;, a peddler; his memoir hints at back-door assignations with &quot;servant girls and chambermaids&quot;; by his own description, his life at this point was just a step from a life of crime. Through his uncle Arke, &quot;a hot theater lover&quot;, he became interested in the theater, at first in the beauty of Olga Glebova and the cut of Ivan Kozelsky&#x27;s clothes, but he had the good fortune to be in one of the great theater cities of his time.

At 17 he became the leader of Glebova&#x27;s claque, was working as a copyist for lawyers, and going out to a theater, a tavern, or a party every night. He would later draw on his own life at this time for his portrayal of Protosov in Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Living Corpse&quot;. Over the next few years he had numerous love affairs, and was prevented from a love marriage with one Esther Raizel because his own dubious reputation compounded the taint of his mother&#x27;s divorce. He survived another pogrom, but his family was financially ruined by the destruction of their possessions and the theft of their money.

In writing about this period in his memoir, Adler mentions attending and admiring performances by Israel Grodner, a Brody singer and improvisational actor who would soon become one of the founders of professional Yiddish theater. A song of Grodner&#x27;s about an old father turned away by his children would later be the germ of the idea for &quot;The Yiddish King Lear&quot;. He writes that he would have become a Brody singer, like Grodner, except &quot;I had no voice&quot;. This lack of a singing voice would be a major factor in the direction of his acting career: according to Rosenfeld, although Yiddish theater was long dominated by vaudevilles and operettas, &quot;He was the only Yiddish actor to rely entirely on classics and translations of modern European plays.&quot;

==&quot;Sanitar&quot; and Inspector==
The outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War brought on universal conscription of young men. At his family&#x27;s urging, Adler bribed his way into becoming a &quot;sanitar&quot;, an assistant in the Red Cross Medical Corps. He was selected (apparently on little more than his appearance) by Prince Vladimir Petrovich Meshersky to work at a German hospital in Bender, Moldova, dealing mainly with typhus patients. In his four months there, he became a favorite with the established Jewish families there, and earned a Gold Medal for Outstanding Achievement for his brief service to the Tsar.

Returning to Odessa, he got a job distributing newspapers. This respectable work required getting up at 6 a.m., not good for a carouser. Still, newspaper connection meant that he soon heard of one of the war&#x27;s other effects: the many Jewish merchants and middlemen war brought to Bucharest were a boon to Abraham Goldfaden&#x27;s nascent Yiddish theater there. Two of his Odessa acquaintances—Israel Rosenberg, a personable con-man, and Jacob Spivakofsky, scion of a wealthy Jewish family—had become actors there, then had left Goldfaden to found their own company, touring in Moldavia. Adler wrote them to urge them to bring their troupe to Odessa.

Adler managed to leverage a recommendation from Prince Meshersky and another from Avrom Markovich Brodsky—a businessman so successful as to have earned the nickname &quot;the Jewish Tsar&quot;—to get a job as a marketplace inspector for the Department of Weights and Measures, rather unusual for a Jew at that time. His mildly corrupt tenure there gave him good contacts with the police. These would soon come in handy for smoothing over certain problems of a young and unlicensed theater troupe when Rosenberg and Spivakofsky returned from Romania, penniless because the end of the war had meant the collapse of Yiddish theater in the provinces, and ready to start a troupe in Odessa.

Adler aspired to be an actor, but found himself at first serving the troupe more as critic and theoretician, making use of his now-vast knowledge of Russian theater. The first productions (Goldfaden&#x27;s &quot;Grandmother and Granddaughter&quot; and &quot;Shmendrick&quot;) were popular successes, but Adler&#x27;s own account suggests that they were basically mediocre, and his Uncle Arke was appalled: &quot;Is this theater? No my child, this is a circus.&quot;

==Acting career==
Lulla Rosenfeld&#x27;s remark that Adler &quot;...rel[ied] entirely on classics and translations of modern European plays&quot; does not quite tell the whole story. On one hand, he was also responsible for recruiting the Yiddish theater&#x27;s first naturalistic playwright, Jacob Gordin, and he scored a great triumph in the title role of Gordin&#x27;s &quot;Der Yiddisher King Lear&quot; (&quot;The Jewish King Lear&quot;), set in 19th-century Russia. On the other, until his 50s, he was not hesitant to take advantage of his prowess as a dancer, and even occasionally took on roles that called for some singing, although by all accounts (including his own) this was not his forte.

===Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Russia===
Adler wrote in his memoir that the passion of his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the profession despite his uncle&#x27;s view. When she was cast by Rosenberg opposite Jacob Spivakovsky in the title role of Abraham Goldfaden&#x27;s darkly comic operetta &quot;Breindele Cossack&quot;, she pulled strings so that the role of Guberman would be reassigned to Adler.

His success in the role was cut short by the news that Goldfaden, whose plays they were using without permission, was coming with his troupe to Odesa. Goldfaden&#x27;s own account says he came there at the urging of his father; Adler attributes it to Rosenberg and Spivakovsky&#x27;s &quot;enemies&quot;. Rosenberg, never the most ethical of men, withdrew his troupe from Odesa to tour the hinterland (soon, though, he would come to an accommodation by which his troupe would be an officially recognized touring company attached to Goldfaden&#x27;s own troupe). &quot;(For greater detail on Adler&#x27;s time with Rosenberg&#x27;s company, see Israel Rosenberg.)&quot;

By his own account, Adler took a leave of absence from his job to travel with Rosenberg&#x27;s troupe to Kherson, where he made a successful acting debut as the lover Marcus in &quot;The Witch of Botoşani&quot;. He overstayed his leave, lost his government post, and the decision to become a full-time actor was effectively made for him. Adler was unhappy that under Tulya Goldfaden there were &quot;No more communistic shares, no more idealistic comradeship&quot;. Still, under this same Goldfaden regime he had his first taste of real stardom when people in Chişinău camped in the courtyards awaiting performances. Even the police seemed to have &quot;fallen in love&quot; with the troupe, dressing up the actors in their uniforms at riotous parties after shows, while trying on the troupe&#x27;s costumes themselves.

Unsatisfied with the low pay, in Kremenchuk Adler led an unsuccessful actors&#x27; strike. A series of intrigues almost led to a breakup with Sonya, but ultimately led both back into Rosenberg&#x27;s troupe and led to their marriage in Poltava. When this particular troupe broke up, the Adlers were among the few players to remain with Rosenberg to form a new one that included the actress who later became famous under the name of Keni Liptzin. In Chernihiv, Adler turned down the opportunity to act in a Russian-language production of &quot;Boris Gudonov&quot;. Around this time Goldfaden appeared again and, after using an elaborate intrigue to demonstrate to the Adlers that Rosenberg had no loyalty to them, recruited them to his own troupe, which at the time appeared to be headed for a triumphant entry into Saint Petersburg.

All that changed with the assassination of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant there would be no performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden&#x27;s troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk (Belarus), to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in a tent theater in Nizhyn. However, matters there proved even worse: Nizhyn soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.

In Łódź, Adler triumphantly played the title role in Karl Gutzkow&#x27;s &quot;Uriel Acosta&quot;, the first of a series of roles through which he developed a persona he would later call &quot;the Grand Jew&quot;. After Łódź, they landed in Zhytomyr, under an incompetent investor/director named Hartenstein. They thought they had found &quot;a quiet corner&quot; of the Russian Empire in which &quot;to make a bit of a livelihood&quot;, but in fact Hartenstein was simply running through his money.

The financial consequences of the collapse of their company were mitigated by a series of three benefit performances, in coordination with the local Russian-language theater company. Sonya returned to Odessa to give birth to their daughter Rivka; Adler stayed on six weeks in Zhytomyr and had sort of a belated apprenticeship with two Russian character actors of national fame, Borisov and Philipovsky. However, he returned to Odesa thinking that he would most likely leave theater behind.

Late in life, when he looked back at his years acting in Adler and Goldfaden&#x27;s companies, Adler saw it as merely the &quot;childhood&quot; of his career. He describes his thoughts toward the end of this period, &quot;For three years I had wandered in the cave of the Witch in the clown&#x27;s rags of Shmendrick and what did I really know of my trade?... If someday I return to the Yiddish theater, let me at least not be so ignorant.&quot;

Returning to Odesa, he discovered that no one would employ him in any job other than as an actor. In 1882, he put together a troupe of his own with Keni Liptzin, and brought Rosenberg in as a partner. This troupe toured to Rostov, Taganrog, around Lithuania, to Dünaburg (now Daugavpils, Latvia). Aiming to bring the troupe to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 when the news arrived that a total ban was about to be placed on Yiddish theater in Russia.

The troupe were left stranded in Riga. Chaikel Bain took ill and died. With some difficulty, passage to London for the troupe was arranged on a cattle ship, in exchange for entertaining the crew. However, about this time Israel Grodner and his wife Annetta reappeared. Adler wanted to include them in the group headed for London. According to Adler, Rosenberg, who played many of the same roles as Israel Grodner, essentially told Adler &quot;it&#x27;s him or me&quot;. Adler attempted to convince him to change his mind, but insisted on including Grodner in the travel party: Adler considered him one of the best actors in Yiddish theater, a great asset to any performances they would give in London, while he felt Rosenberg lacked depth as an actor. He tried to get Rosenberg to come with them to London, but Rosenberg would not budge.

===London===

Of his time in London, Adler wrote, &quot; if Yiddish theater was destined to go through its infancy in Russia, and in America grew to manhood and success, then London was its school.&quot;
Adler arrived in London with few contacts. In Whitechapel, the center of Jewish London at that time, he encountered extremes of poverty that he describes as exceeding any he had ever seen in Russia or would ever see in New York. The Chief Rabbi of the British Empire at that time, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler, was a relative. Adler&#x27;s father had written him a letter of introduction in Hebrew, but nothing could have been farther from the rabbi&#x27;s desires than to assist Yiddish-language theater. Nathan Marcus Adler viewed Yiddish as a &quot;jargon&quot; that existed at the expense of both liturgical Hebrew and the English necessary for upward mobility, and his Orthodox Judaism &quot;could not endure so much as a blessing given on stage, for such a blessing would be given &quot;in vain&quot;&quot;; further, he was afraid that the portrayals of Jews on stage would give aid and comfort to their enemies.

At this time, Yiddish theater in London meant amateur clubs. The arrival of professional Yiddish actors from Russia worked great changes, bringing Yiddish theater in London to a new level and allowing a modest professionalism, though never at much more than a poverty wage. Adler&#x27;s memoir acknowledges many people who helped him out in various ways. Eventually, with the aid in particular of Sonya&#x27;s relative Herman Fiedler—a playwright, orchestra leader, and stage manager—the Adlers and the Grodners were able to take over the Prescott Street Club. There they presented generally serious theater to audiences of about 150. Fiedler adapted &quot;The Odessa Beggar&quot; from Felix Pyat&#x27;s &quot;The Ragpicker of Paris&quot;, a tragicomic play written on the eve of the Revolutions of 1848. Adler starred in it, in a role he would continue to play throughout his career.

Two months later, he played &quot;Uriel Acosta&quot; at the Holborn Theatre to an audience of 500, including the &quot;Jewish aristocrats of the West End&quot;. The piety of the London Jews was such that they had to use an (unplayable) cardboard ram&#x27;s horn so as to avoid blasphemy. Chief Rabbi Adler and his son and eventual successor Hermann Adler were present, and both, especially the younger rabbi, were favorably impressed. There were even mentions in the English-language press.

Playing to small audiences, on tiny stages, in communal troupes where all but the stars had day jobs, and playing only Saturday and Sunday (the pious London Jews would never have tolerated Friday performances), Adler focused on serious theater like never before. However, he and Grodner soon fell out: they wrangled over ideology and over parts, and their verbal duels boiled over into improvised stage dialogue. The Grodners ultimately left to do theater in a series of other locations, notably Paris, but eventually came back to London, where Israel Grodner died in 1887.

By November 1885, Adler had a theatrical club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a week, but with a fame well out of proportion to the meagre money. Many of the most prominent figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances when they passed through London.

One of Adler&#x27;s roles from this period was as the villain Franz Moore in Herman Fiedler&#x27;s adaptation of Schiller&#x27;s &quot;The Robbers&quot;, which introduced Schiller into Yiddish theater. On at least one occasion in 1886, he played both Franz Moore and the play&#x27;s hero, Franz&#x27;s brother Karl Moore: in the play they never meet.

In 1886, Adler&#x27;s daughter Rivka died of croup; Sonya died of an infection contracted while giving birth to their son Abram; meanwhile, he had been carrying on an affair with a young woman, Jenny (&quot;Jennya&quot;) Kaiser, who was also pregnant, with his son Charles. Depressed after Sonya&#x27;s death, he passed up an offer to relocate to the United States, which was taken up instead by Mogulesko and Finkel. In winter 1887, an audience at the Princes Street Club panicked when they thought a simulated stage fire was real; 17 people died in the stampede. While the authorities determined that this was not Adler&#x27;s fault, and the club was allowed to reopen, the crowds did not return; &quot;the theater,&quot; he writes, &quot;was so cold, dark, and empty you could hunt wolves in the gallery.&quot;

Adler&#x27;s affair with Jennya continued; he also took up with a young chorus girl from an Orthodox Jewish family, Dinah Shtettin. His memoir is extremely unclear on the sequence of events, and hints at other affairs at this time. The memoir does make clear that the &quot;hot-blooded&quot; Jennya had little interest in a marriage, while Dinah&#x27;s father insisted on a marriage, even though he despised Alder and made it clear that he doubted the marriage would last.

===Coming to America===
With the aid of a small sum of money from his distant relative the Chief Rabbi, Adler got together the money to travel by steerage to New York, with his infant son Abrom, Alexander Oberlander and his family, Keni and Volodya Liptzin, and Herman Fiedler, among others. Adler did not doubt that the rabbi was glad to see Yiddish actors leaving London. In New York, they promptly discovered that neither Mogulesko and Finkel at the Romanian Opera House nor Maurice Heine at the Oriental Theater had any use for them. They headed on to Chicago, where, after a brief initial success, the troupe fell apart due to a combination of labor disputes and cutthroat competition. The Oberlanders managed to start a restaurant; he and Keni Liptzin headed to New York that autumn, where she managed to sign on at the Romanian Opera House; failing to find a similar situation for himself, he returned to London, drawn back to the charms of both Dinah and Jennya.

He did not remain long in London. After some major successes in Warsaw, which was under Austrian rule, he returned to London in the spring of 1889, and then again to New York, this time to play for Heine at Poole&#x27;s Theater. After an initial failure in &quot;The Odessa Beggar&quot; (he writes that the New York audience of the time was not ready for &quot;tragicomedy&quot;), he was a success in the melodrama &quot;Moishele Soldat&quot;, and &quot;a more worthy success&quot; in &quot;Uriel Acosta&quot;. This gave him the basis to bring Dinah to America. Their marriage didn&#x27;t last, though the divorce was amicable: she remarried, to Siegmund Feinman. Adler fell out with Heine, initially over business; at this time Heine&#x27;s marriage was also falling apart, and Sara Heine would eventually become Sara Adler. Adler went on the road with Boris Thomashefsky, who at the time was pioneering the touring circuit for Yiddish theater in America. They played in Philadelphia and Chicago, where word arrived of an opportunity to take over Poole&#x27;s, Heine having moved on to the Thalia. Adler returned to New York, where he managed also to win Mogulesko and Kessler away from Heine.

===New York===

Renaming Poole&#x27;s as the Union Theater, Adler attempted to produce the most serious Yiddish-language theater New York had yet seen in the Yiddish Theater District, with plays such as Scribe&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot;, Zolotkev&#x27;s &quot;Samson the Great&quot;, and Sinckievich&#x27;s &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;. However, after Thomashefsky became an enormous popular success in Moses Halevy Horowitz&#x27;s operetta &quot;David ben Jesse&quot; at Moishe Finkel&#x27;s National Theater, the Union Theater temporarily to abandon its highbrow programming and competed head on, with operettas &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot;, &quot;Titus Andronicus, or the Second Destruction of the Temple&quot;, and &quot;Hymie in America&quot;.

Adler was not content to continue long in this mode, and sought a playwright who could create pieces that would appeal to the Jewish public, while still providing a type of theater he could be proud to perform. He recruited Jacob Gordin, already a well-respected novelist and intellectual, recently arrived in New York and eking out a living as a journalist at the &quot;Arbeiter Zeitung&quot;, precursor to &quot;The Forward&quot;. Gordin&#x27;s first two plays, &quot;Siberia&quot; and &quot;Two Worlds&quot; were commercial failures—so much so that Mogulesko and Kessler quit the company—but &quot;The Yiddish King Lear&quot;, starring Adler and his new wife Sara was such a success that the play eventually transferred to Finkel&#x27;s larger National Theater. This play (based only very loosely on Shakespeare) played well with the popular audience, but also with Jewish intellectuals who until this time had largely ignored Yiddish Theater, ending for a time the commercial dominance of operettas such as those of Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner. The next year, Gordin&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Man&quot; solidified this change in the direction of Yiddish theater. 
Over the next decades, Adler would play in (or, in some cases, merely produce) numerous plays by Gordin, but also classics by Shakespeare, Schiller, Lessing; Eugène Scribe&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot;; dramatizations of George du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Trilby&quot; and Alexandre Dumas, fils&#x27; &quot;Camille&quot;; and the works of modern playwrights such as Gorky, Ibsen, Shaw, Strindberg, Gerhart Hauptmann, Victor Hugo, Victorien Sardou, and Leonid Andreyev. Frequently the works of the great contemporary playwrights—even Shaw, who was writing in English—would be staged in New York in Yiddish years, even decades, before they were ever staged there in English.

Having already famously played Shylock in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; on the Yiddish stage at the People&#x27;s Theater, he played the role again in a 1903 Broadway production, directed by Arthur Hopkins. In this production, Adler spoke his lines in Yiddish while the rest of the cast spoke in English. The &quot;New York Times&quot; review of Adler&#x27;s performance was not favorable: in particular his naturalistic acting style was not what audiences of the period expected in a production of Shakespeare. Some other reviews (such as that in &quot;Theater&quot; magazine) were friendlier; in any event the same production was revived two years later.

Lulla Rosenfeld writes that Henry Irving, the great Shylock before that time, played Shylock as &quot;morally superior to the Christians around him... driven to cruelty only by their more cruel persecutions.&quot; In contrast, &quot;Adler scorned justification. Total vindication was his aim.&quot; In Adler&#x27;s own words, &quot;Shylock from the first was governed by &quot;pride&quot; rather than revenge. He wishes to humble and terrify Antonio for the insult and humiliation he has suffered at his hands. This is why he goes so far as to bring his knife and scales into the court. For Shylock, however, the desired climax was to refuse the pound of flesh with a gesture of divine compassion. When the verdict goes against him, he is crushed because he has been robbed of this opportunity, not because he lusts for Antonio&#x27;s death. This was my interpretation. This is the Shylock I have tried to show.&quot; After his two Broadway triumphs, Adler returned to Yiddish theater.

In the wake of the Kishinev pogrom, Adler went back briefly to Eastern Europe in summer 1903, where he tried to convince various family members to come to America. Although he was greeted as a hero, he was only partially successful in convincing people to leave; his mother, in particular, was determined to finish out her life where she was. (His father had died some years earlier.) He persuaded his sister Sarah Adler to follow him to America as her husband had died of heart disease in Verdun in 1897 and she was raising seven children on her own. She emigrated in 1905.

Returning to New York, he and Thomashefsky jointly leased The People&#x27;s Theater, intending to use it on different nights of the week. Adler, exhausted from his Russian trip, was often leaving his nights unused, and Thomashefsky offered to buy him out for $10,000 on the condition that he would not return to performing in New York. Adler was so insulted that the two did not speak for months, even though at the time they were living across a courtyard from one another, and could see into each other&#x27;s St. Mark&#x27;s Place apartments. Adler decided to perform Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Darkness&quot;, and decided that he would do his own translation from Russian to Yiddish. The play was a great success, the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the U.S., and Thomashefsky was so obviously happy for Adler that their friendship was renewed. Adler followed with equally successful productions of Gordin&#x27;s dramatization of Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection&quot; and the Gordin original &quot;The Homeless&quot;.
In 1904 Adler had the Grand Theater built in what was to be the Yiddish Theater District at the corner of Bowery and Canal Street, the first purpose-built Yiddish theater in New York. His wife Sara had branched out to do her own plays at the Novelty Theater in Brooklyn, and the family had taken up residence in a four-story brownstone, with an elevator, in the East Seventies. (They would later move one more time, to Riverside Drive.) Around this time Lincoln Steffens wrote a piece saying that Yiddish theater in New York had eclipsed English-language theater in quality.

This golden age was not to last. The years 1905–1908 saw half a million new Jewish immigrants to New York, and once again the largest audience for Yiddish theater was for lighter fare. Adler hung on, but the Thomashefskys were making a fortune at the Thalia; plays with titles like &quot;Minke the Servant Girl&quot; were far outdrawing fare like Gordin&#x27;s &quot;Dementia Americana&quot; (1909). It would be 1911 before Adler scored another major success, this time with Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Living Corpse&quot; (also known as &quot;Redemption&quot;), translated into Yiddish by Leon Kobrin.

In 1919–1920, Adler, despite his own socialist politics, found himself in a labor dispute with the Hebrew Actors&#x27; Union; he played that season in London rather than New York. A stroke in 1920 while vacationing in upstate New York nearly ended his acting career, although he continued to appear occasionally, usually as part of a benefit performance for himself, often playing Act I of &quot;The Yiddish King Lear&quot;: the title character remains seated throughout the entire act. In 1924, he was well enough to perform in the title role of a revival of Gordin&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot;, inspired by Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Enoch Arden&quot;: the character is &quot;a sick and broken man&quot;, so the Adler was able to integrate his own physical weakness into the portrayal. However, March 31, 1926, he collapsed suddenly, dying almost instantly.
He is buried in Old Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, Queens.

==Family==
Adler was married three times, first to Sophia (Sonya) Oberlander (died 1886), then to Dinah Shtettin (m. 1887- divorced. 1891) and finally to actress Sara Adler (previously Sara Heine) (m. 1891), who survived him by over 25 years.

His and Sonya&#x27;s daughter Rivkah (Rebecca) died at the age of 3. Sonya died from an infection contracted while giving birth to their son Abram in 1886. Abram&#x27;s son Allen Adler (1916–1964) was, among other things, the screenwriter of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;. While still married to Sonya, Adler had an affair with Jenny &quot;Jennya&quot; Kaiser, with whom he had a son, stage actor Charles Adler (1886–1966).

Adler and Dinah Shtettin had a daughter, Celia Adler (1889–1979).

He and Sara Heine had six children: the well-known actors Luther (1903–1984) and Stella Adler (1901–1992) and the lesser-known actors Jay (1896–1978), Frances, Julia, and Florence. Jacob and Stella Adler are both members of the American Theater Hall of Fame. Stella was a famous actress and theatre teacher.

His sister Sarah/Soore Adler and her seven children emigrated to New York in 1905. His niece, Francine Larrimore, Sarah&#x27;s daughter, became a Broadway actress, who also appeared in films. He was the great-uncle of actor Jerry Adler.

==Memoir==
Adler&#x27;s memoirs were published in the New York socialist Yiddish-language newspaper &quot;Die Varheit&quot; in 1916–1919, and briefly resumed in 1925 in an unsuccessful revival of that paper; his granddaughter Lulla Rosenfeld&#x27;s English translation was published only in 1999. The 1916–1919 portion of the memoir gives a detailed picture of his Russian years. The 1925 portion gives a comparably detailed picture of his time in London, although with some evasions around the relative timing of his relationships with his wife Sonya and with Jennya Kaiser and Dinah Shtettin. It contains only a relatively fragmentary description of his New York career. In the English-language book of these memoirs, Rosenfeld attempts to fill the gaps with her own commentary.

Adler writes vividly and with humor. He describes the director Hartenstein as &quot;a young man from Galicia with long hair and short brains, half educated in Vienna, and half an actor&quot;, and refers to the poor of Whitechapel as looking as if they &quot;had come out of their mothers already gray and old.&quot; Of his early London years, he writes, &quot;We played for a tiny audience, on a stage the size of a cadaver, but we played well, with a drunkenness of happiness.&quot;

In a small essay, &quot;Shmendrick, My Mephistopheles&quot;, one of the last passages he wrote, Adler describes the last time he saw &quot;Shmendrick&quot; played, at a memorial for Goldfaden in 1912. Lamenting the choice of play for the memorial—&quot;Goldfaden has written better things&quot;—he nonetheless acknowledges, that same bitter Shmendrick was our livelihood... I gritted my teeth. I called on the ghosts of Aristophanes, of Shakespeare, of Lope de Vega. I wept and swallowed my own tears... And I cursed the fate that bound me to him... Yet even as I cursed and condemned, the tears rose. For my whole life, my whole past, was before me on that stage... Poor weak first step of our Yiddish theater... I thank you for the happiness you gave us... I thank you Shmendrick—my beloved—my own.

<text>Strike Fighter Squadron 41 (VFA-41) also known as the &quot;Black Aces&quot;, is a United States Navy strike fighter squadron based at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, flying the F/A-18F Super Hornet. They are attached to Carrier Air Wing 9 (CVW-9). Their radio callsign is &quot;Fast Eagle&quot; and their tailcode is NG.

== History ==

=== 1950s ===
VF-41 was established on 1 September 1950 at NAS Oceana, it is the fourth US Navy squadron to be designated VF-41. The &quot;Black Aces&quot; began flying the F2H-3 Banshee in 1953, deploying to the Mediterranean and Far East aboard . On 24 January 1956, VF-41 embarked with ATG-181 for the shakedown cruise of near Guantanamo Bay Cuba, returning to NAS Oceana on 31 March 1956. VF-41 again attached to ATG-181 embarked aboard on October 3, 1956 for a Western Pacific deployment. The crew observed the 15th anniversary of &quot;Battle of the Coral Sea&quot; with ceremony at location of the battle conducted by veterans of the battle. ATG-181 returned to NAS Oceana on May 23, 1957. In 1959, the Banshee was replaced by the F3H-2 Demon.

=== 1960s ===
In February 1962, VF-41 transitioned to the F-4B Phantom II and made a special deployment to NAS Key West, Florida during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In May 1965, the squadron deployed to the western Pacific for seven months of combat operations during the Vietnam War. They flew a wide range of missions: fighter cover, reconnaissance escort, flak suppression and day/night interdiction.

=== 1970s ===

The next five deployments (flying the F-4J,B,N) were on with CVW-6 tail code AE (awarded the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation for period 9 March 1972 through 1 December 1972). VF-41 transitioned from the F-4B to the F-4J in 1973 and (as an 18 aircraft squadron) was on USS &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; during the Yom Kippur War providing escorts for Operation Nickel Grass and were part of the peacekeeping force that helped keep the truce after the war.

In 1974, VF-41 transitioned from the F-4B to the F-4N and conducted their last cruise with the Phantom aboard &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot; in 1975. During that year VF-41 was awarded the COMNAVAIRLANT Safety &quot;S&quot;, which they also would receive in 1981, 1989 and 1992. In April 1976 VF-41 transitioned to the F-14A Tomcat and their first cruise began in September 1977 as part of CVW-8 on . Another cruise followed in 1980 to the Mediterranean.

=== 1980s ===

In 1980, &quot;Nimitz&quot; and VF-41 took part in a round-the-Horn cruise. While on this cruise, the carrier served as the seaborne base in response to the Iran hostage crisis and the subsequent attempted rescue of the U.S. Embassy hostages from Iran. VF-41 (and the rest of the battle group) spent 144 continuous days at sea, the longest period the squadron had spent at sea without break since World War II.

During workups for the 1981–1982 Mediterranean cruise, an EA-6B Prowler piloted by Marine Lieut. Steven E. White, crashed on the deck of &quot;Nimitz&quot;. Upon crashing onto the deck, the Prowler rammed broadside into six fueled F-14 Tomcats causing a fuel fire and ordnance to explode, including an AIM-7 Sparrow missile. The incident, which caused only superficial damage to &quot;Nimitz&quot;, resulted in three F-14s destroyed, 45 injured sailors and fourteen casualties with VF-41 losing three shipmates.

While on deployment in the Mediterranean on 19 August 1981, during a routine combat air patrol mission over the Gulf of Sidra, two Libyan Su-22 &quot;Fitter&quot; aircraft were shot down by squadron aircraft. The incident marked the first Navy air combat confrontation since the Vietnam War and the first ever for the F-14A Tomcat. It was the first time a variable wing geometry aircraft shot down another variable wing geometry aircraft. 1981 was also the first year in which the squadron won the COMNAVAIRLANT Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot;, signifying them as the most efficient squadron in the Atlantic Fleet. VF-41 was also awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; in 1985 and 1989.

In November 1982, the squadron embarked on an extended deployment off the coast of Beirut, Lebanon, in support of the Multinational Force in Lebanon.

During 1985, VF-41 spent 68 days off the coast of Lebanon in response to the hijacking of TWA Flight 847.

The 1986 cruise was the last with &quot;Nimitz&quot;; it began in December and ended in June 1987 when &quot;Nimitz&quot; got to her new home in San Diego. In October that year, CVW-8 was deployed with and the first cruise was in the North Atlantic for Exercise Teamwork ’88 which involved operations with the Royal Norwegian Air Force and the first Mediterranean deployment was in December.

=== 1990s ===
On 28 December 1990, VF-41 embarked on to support Operation Desert Shield, arriving in the Persian Gulf shortly after hostilities with Iraq began. By the end of the war, the squadron had amassed over 1,500 combat flight hours. After the war, the squadron remained in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea as part of a military presence enforcing the ceasefire until late April 1991, when the squadron was tasked with providing air support for ground forces assisting Kurdish refugees in Northern Iraq during Operation Provide Comfort.

VF-41 was soon training for the F-14&#x27;s new role: air-to-ground bombing. In late 1991, VF-41 had flown over 46,500 hours without an accident over a period of 11 years.

In 1995 VF-84 was disestablished and VF-41 picked up the TARPS mission. The disestablishment of VF-84 was the only occasion in which a TARPS capable unit was disestablished instead of a non-TARPS capable unit.

In early 1995 VF-41 deployed on a six-month deployment to the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf and the Adriatic Sea. During this cruise VF-41 conducted combat operations in support of Operation Deliberate Force and Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia and Herzegovina and Operation Southern Watch over Iraq. On 5 September 1995, two VF-41 F-14As dropped laser-guided bombs for the first time in combat during Operation Deliberate Force. The target was an ammunition dump in eastern Bosnia. The bombs were guided by F/A-18s. VF-41 adopted the slogan &quot;First To Fight, First To Strike&quot; in recognition of being the first F-14 squadron to score air-to-air kills and drop bombs in combat. During this deployment VF-41 logged over 600 combat hours and 530 sorties, and during a week of combat in the Balkans (5–12 September 1995), VF-41 dropped 24,000 pounds of ordnance on Bosnian-Serb targets, the bulk of it precision guided bombs laser designated by F/A-18 Hornets.

In 1996, VF-14 joined VF-41 in CVW-8 and thus CVW-8 was one of few air wings in the US Navy with two F-14 squadrons, rather than one. CVW-8 deployed on board in February 1996, for a Joint Fleet Exercise. This was followed by deployed operations to the North Atlantic while embarked on with port calls to Dublin, Ireland and Portsmouth, England.

In April 1997, CVW-8 embarked on USS &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; for a Mediterranean/Persian Gulf deployment. During this deployment, CVW-8 participated in numerous exercises and detachments including Infinite Acclaim, Beacon Flash and Invitex. During Invitex the Air Wing completed over 350 sorties including 203 sorties in a single day of surge operations. This deployment also included operations over Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of Operation Deliberate Guard and over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch.

In 1999, USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; departed for the Mediterranean and joined NATO forces for Operation Allied Force. VF-41&#x27;s first strike was against an ammunition storage facility in Pristina, Kosovo on 6 April. In July, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch, where VF-41 became the first squadron to expend ordnance in two theatres on a single deployment. VF-41 logged over 1,100 combat hours during 384 sorties and dropped over 160 tons of laser-guided munitions with an unprecedented 85% success rate in support of Operation Allied Force and Operation Southern Watch.

The squadron won the Wade McClusky Award in 1999, as most outstanding attack squadron in the US Navy. This marked the first time an F-14 squadron won the award, which previously been given only to A-6 and F/A-18 units.

=== 2000s ===
In April 2001, VF-41 embarked on their final F-14 cruise aboard , supporting Operation Southern Watch and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). As the carrier headed for home, they were given order to head to the Gulf of Oman after the September 11 attacks. During the build-up to war, VF-41 conducted several TARPS missions near the Pakistani/Afghani-border.

USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; and its air group was the night carrier during OEF and thus did not see action until 8 October, when VF-41 attacked several cave complexes. One of the first target hit was the Shindand airbase, in western Afghanistan, where the Taliban were storing aircraft, radar and vehicles. By the end of the deployment in November, VF-41 had dropped over 200,000 lbs of ordnance (202 laser-guided bombs).

Shortly after their return in late 2001, VF-41 transitioned to the F/A-18F Super Hornet and was redesignated VFA-41.

On 18 October 2002 four VFA-41 aviators were killed when two F/A-18Fs collided in mid-air off the coast of California.

During Operation Iraqi Freedom, two F/A-18Fs were forward deployed to in late March 2003. These F/A-18s were requested to boost the aerial refueling capabilities of CVW-14, as well as to provide additional qualified Forward Air Controllers. The F/A-18s flew from &quot;Nimitz&quot; to &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, a 2700-mile trip. On 6 April, the Hornets returned to &quot;Nimitz&quot;. During the war VFA-41 expended laser-guided bombs, as well as JDAM and AGM-65 Maverick missiles.

In May 2005 VFA-41 again deployed to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During this deployment the squadron was featured in the PBS documentary &quot;Carrier&quot; with a heavy focus on Commander David Fravor.

In 2007 VFA-41 deployed aboard &quot;Nimitz&quot; for a WESTPAC cruise and participated in Operation Valiant Shield, a joint-force exercise in the vicinity of Guam.

In January 2008 the squadron surge-deployed to &quot;Nimitz&quot; in the Pacific. On 13 February 2008, it was reported that several Russian Tu-95 bombers were intercepted over the Pacific by F/A-18s from &quot;Nimitz&quot; while on a surge deployment in the region. One Tu-95 was escorted and flew directly over the carrier at , escorted by VFA-41 Hornets. The Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Gary Roughead called the incident &quot;benign&quot; and said: &quot;they came out to look. We joined up (and) flew with them until they went home&quot;. A total of four Russian bombers were involved; two remained about 500 miles east of the carrier strike group, and another orbited about 50 miles away as one Tu-95 did two low passes over the Nimitz carrier group.

After their return to the United States, VFA-41 began trading in their Lot 26 F/A-18Fs for Lot 30 F/A-18Fs which are fitted with AESA radar technology.

During 2009 CVW-11 and the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Strike Group conducted several training exercises off the coast of Southern California including composite unit training and joint task force training in anticipation for their 2009–2010 deployment. On 28 July it was reported that CVW-11 and the &quot;Nimitz&quot; Strike Group was to depart for an eight-month deployment.

=== 2010s ===
By January 2010 VFA-41 had flown over 2,500 combat hours in 400 combat missions supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. VFA-41 joined CVW-9 in 2010 and started workups for a WESTPAC deployment in 2011.

From 27 July 2011 to 26 February 2012, CVW-9 deployed on board to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, counter-piracy and maritime security operations. VFA-41 supported Operation Enduring Freedom and the final combat missions of Operation New Dawn.

Following a short six-month turnaround, the squadron once again cruised on a surge deployment from 1 September 2012 to 28 April 2013 on board USS &quot;John C. Stennis&quot;. The squadron returned to the Middle East and flew missions in support of the 5th Fleet and Operation Enduring Freedom.

In January 2016 VFA-41 with Carrier Air Wing 9 deployed aboard &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; to the South China Sea to ensure freedom of navigation. Ports of call during this deployment included Guam, Busan, Singapore, Manila and Pearl Harbor. The squadron flew out to its landbase at Lemoore, California on 9 August. VFA-41 conducted combat flights in support of Operations Inherent Resolve, Resolute Support and Freedom Sentinel over Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. Carrier Air Wing NINE squadrons returned to NAS Lemoore, North Island, Point Mugu, and Whidbey Island in May 2019.

===2020s===

During the 2020s, the squadron was a part of Carrier Air Wing 9 on the USS Abraham Lincoln.. In early August 2024, the squadron was deployed on the USS Abraham Lincoln in response to heightened tensions between Iran and Israel.

<text>The Marvel Comics rating system is a system for rating the content of comic books, with regard to appropriateness for different age groups. In 2001, Marvel Comics withdrew from the Comics Code Authority and established its own rating system for its publications. This was precipitated by the CCA refusing approval of the seal due to the strong depiction of violence in &quot;X-Force&quot; #116, a comic written by Peter Milligan and drawn by Mike Allred. As well, by withdrawing from the CCA, this is seen as a move by editor-in-chief Joe Quesada to lure more high-profile creators to Marvel Comics. Today&#x27;s ratings are usually found on the comic&#x27;s UPC box.

==System==
The Marvel Rating System assigns each comic book one of the following ratings:

*ALL AGES – Appropriate for all ages.
*T – Appropriate for most readers, but parents are advised that they might want to read before or with younger children.
*T+ TEENS AND UP – Appropriate for teens 13 and up.
*PARENTAL ADVISORY – Appropriate for 15 and up. Similar to T+, but featuring more mature themes and/or more graphic imagery. Recommended for teen and adult readers.
*EXPLICIT CONTENT – Appropriate for 18 and up. Most Mature Readers books will fall under the MAX imprint (created specifically for mature content titles). MAX and mature-themed titles will continue to be designed to appear distinct from mainline Marvel titles, with the &quot;MAX: Explicit Content&quot; label very prominently displayed on the cover. MAX titles will &quot;not&quot; be sold on the newsstand, and they will &quot;not&quot; be sold to younger readers.

==History==
The first Marvel rating system was implemented in 2001, following their publishing of an issue of X-Force without the approval of self-regulatory system the Comics Code Authority (CCA). The CCA deemed the issue too violent, and following this, Marvel removed its entire line from the scrutiny of the Comics Code. Their age rating system used the following categories:

*ALL AGES
*PG (Parental Guidance)
*PG+
*PARENTAL ADVISORY/EXPLICIT CONTENT

However, the Motion Picture Association of America complained, as it holds a trademark on such classifications as PG and PG-13 (see MPAA film rating system). Marvel thus switched to the following system (by changing the PG ratings):

*ALL AGES
*PSR (Parental Supervision Recommended)
*PSR+
*PARENTAL ADVISORY/EXPLICIT CONTENT

Beginning in June 2005, Marvel switched to yet another system:

*ALL AGES
*A Appropriate for age 9 and up.
*T Recommended for TEEN AND UP UNLESS WITH PARENTAL SUPERVISION
*T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEEN AND UP
*PARENTAL ADVISORY
*MAX: EXPLICIT CONTENT

<text>Julius Ochs Adler (December 3, 1892 – October 3, 1955) was an American publisher, journalist, and highly decorated United States Army officer with the rank of major general. He distinguished himself during World War I as Major and battalion commander in the 306th Infantry Regiment and received Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest decorations of the United States military for valor in combat.

Following the War, he returned to his civilian job as journalist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, but retained his reserve commission. Adler was recalled for federal service in 1940 and reached the rank of Brigadier general. He later served as Assistant Division Commander, 6th Infantry Division during New Guinea campaign, but reverted to the inactive status in late 1944. However Adler remained active in the Army Organized Reserve and reached the rank of major general and commander of 77th Infantry Division.

==Early career and World War I==
Julius O. Adler was born on December 3, 1892, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the son of Harry Clay Adler and Ada Ochs. He graduated from Baylor University School in Chattanooga in 1908 and then entered the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, which he completed in summer 1910. Adler was then admitted to the Princeton University from which he graduated with Bachelor of Arts degree in June 1914. Upon his graduation, he joined the staff of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

His first military experience came in 1915, when he entered the Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camp, the first businessmen&#x27;s training camp at Plattsburgh, New York. Adler participated regularly in the summer military trainings at the Governors Island and was commissioned second lieutenant in the Cavalry on April 7, 1917, the day after the American entry into World War I. He was called up to active service shortly thereafter and rose to the rank of captain by the end of August 1917.

Adler was transferred to the Infantry Branch and joined the 306th Infantry Regiment at Camp Upton, New York as Commander of &quot;Company H&quot;. Following several months of intensive training, he embarked with the regiment as the part of 77th Division for Western Front in April 1918. Adler was promoted to major and assumed command of the battalion, which he led during the Oise-Aisne, Meuse-Argonne, Champagne, and Lorraine campaigns.

On October 14, 1918, during the Meuse–Argonne offensive, Adler accompanied by fellow officer supervised the work of clearing the enemy from Saint-Juvin in the Ardennes department in northern France. They suddenly came upon a party of the enemy numbering 150 Germans. Adler, armed only with his pistol, opened the fire on the enemy and ran toward the party, calling on them to surrender. His bravery and good marksmanship resulted in the capture of 50 Germans, and the remainder fled. For this act of valor, Adler was decorated with Distinguished Service Cross, the second highest decorations of the United States military for valor in combat.

He was also decorated with two Silver Stars citation for bravery and received Purple Heart for wounds received by combat gas. The Allies bestowed him Legion of Honour, French &quot;Croix de guerre 1914–1918&quot; with Palm and Italian War Merit Cross. The State of New York decorated him with New York Meritorious Service Medal.

==Interwar period==

Adler returned stateside in April 1919 and reverted to the inactive status on May 10, 1919. He retain his reserve commission in the 306th Infantry Regiment and returned to his job with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He become treasurer and vice-president of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and following the death of his uncle, Adolph Ochs, in April 1935, he was appointed General Manager of &quot;The Times&quot;. Adler was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1923 and to colonel in 1930 in the Army Reserve. He assumed command of 306th Infantry Regiment in the Army Reserves in December 1924 and held it until his reactivation in October 1940.

Meanwhile in April 1932, Adler was appointed civilian aide to the Secretary of War, Patrick J. Hurley in connection with Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camp for Second Corps Area under Major general Dennis E. Nolan. For his contribution as a Princeton graduate to journalism or related fields, Adler became the second recipient of the medal awarded annually by the Daily Princetonian Alumni Association.

Adler participated in the pre-World War II defense program and in May 1940, he was appointed Head of the committee of representatives from New York, New Jersey and Delaware, which was responsible for the direction of the registration of 7,200 youths for the Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camps. Adler also urged Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, with the adoption of compulsory military training.

==World War II==
Adler was reactivated at his own request in October 1940 and appointed commanding officer of the 113th Infantry Regiment, 44th Division, at Fort Dix, New Jersey. After several months with that regiment, he was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general on July 15, 1941 and assumed duty as the assistant division commander of the 6th Infantry Division, commanded at the time by Major General Franklin C. Sibert.

He participated in the division&#x27;s desert training in California and embarked with the division to Hawaii in July 1943, some 18 months after America&#x27;s entry into World War II, for defense of the islands. Adler participated in the coordination of the defense plans of Oahu and received the Bronze Star. The 6th Division then conducted intensive jungle training for the next six months, when it received orders to reinforce allied units in the Southwest Pacific. Adler participated in the New Guinea campaign until June 1944, when he became ill and was shipped to the United States for treatment.

Unfortunately his illness was so serious, Adler was declared unfit for further active duty and reverted to an inactive status on November 17, 1944. His service with the 6th Infantry Division on New Guinea did not go entirely unrecognized, however, as he was awarded the Legion of Merit.

==Postwar career==
Adler returned to his job with &quot;The New York Times&quot; as general manager and also resumed his work as the president and publisher of &quot;The Chattanooga Times&quot;. Following on from the surrender of Nazi Germany in May 1945, Adler and several other newspapers executive, visited concentration camps in Germany at the invitation of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in Western Europe. Another tour of duty came in August and September 1945, when he was invited by Secretary of the Navy, James V. Forrestal, to the Pacific Theater of Operations to obtain firsthand observation of the military operations. While in the Pacific, Japan surrendered and Adler filed dispatches to his newspaper aboard the U.S. warships in Tokyo Bay.

Following the activation of the 77th Infantry Division as the part of Army Organized Reserve, General Courtney Hodges, commander of the First Army, appointed Adler as 77th Division&#x27;s new commanding general. Adler commanded his division during the postwar training period at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, and received promotion to major general on January 24, 1948. He also served as the President of the Senior Army Reserve Commanders Association, 1949–1951 and a Reserve member of the Components Policy Board.

Adler was the president and publisher of &quot;The Chattanooga Times&quot;, and general manager of &quot;The New York Times&quot; until his death at the relatively young age of 62 on October 3, 1955. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Adler married to Barbara Stettheimer in 1922. They had two daughters, Barbara A. Katzander and Nancy J. Adler, and a son, Julius Ochs Adler, Jr.

<text>Shivers, also known as The Parasite Murders and They Came from Within, and, for Canadian distribution in French, Frissons ( ; &#x27;chills&#x27; or &#x27;shivers&#x27;), is a 1975 Canadian science fiction body horror film written and directed by David Cronenberg and starring Paul Hampton, Lynn Lowry, and Barbara Steele.

== Plot ==
At Starliner Towers, a luxury apartment complex outside Montreal, Dr. Emil Hobbes murders a young woman named Annabelle. He slices open her stomach, pours acid into the wound and then commits suicide. Nick Tudor, who has been suffering from stomach convulsions, finds their bodies but leaves without calling the police. The two bodies are found by resident doctor Roger St. Luc, who calls the police. Hobbes&#x27; medical partner, Rollo Linsky, tells St. Luc that he and Hobbes had been working on a project to create &quot;a parasite that can take over the function of a human organ.&quot;

After suffering more convulsions, Nick leaves work early. He vomits a parasite over the railing of his balcony. The parasite slithers back into the apartment, where it attacks a cleaning woman in the basement, attaching itself to her face. Nick&#x27;s wife Janine tries to care for him, but he ignores her and prefers to talk to the parasites undulating in his abdomen. At the clinic, Roger sees a sexually active middle-aged resident who has been suffering from stomach convulsions. Roger speculates that his condition might be an STD that he caught from Annabelle.

Linsky calls Roger from Hobbes&#x27; office downtown to tell him that Hobbes had developed a parasite that was &quot;a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease that will, hopefully, turn the world into one beautiful mindless orgy.&quot; Hobbes believed modern humans had become over-intellectual and estranged from their primal impulses. Hobbes&#x27; ambition with his parasitic invention was to reassert humanity&#x27;s unbridled, sexually aggressive instincts, and he used Annabelle as his guinea pig. Linsky warns Roger not to approach anyone who is behaving in a strange manner.

Nick tries to force his wife Janine to have sex with him, but she recoils in horror when one of the parasites crawls from his mouth. She rushes to the apartment of her friend Betts, who was infected by one of the parasites while taking a bath. Betts seduces Janine and, as they kiss, passes a parasite to her. Meanwhile, other residents, including a little girl in an elevator with her mother, who are assaulted by a deliveryman, become infected with the parasite, attack other residents and continue to spread the infection. Soon the hallways are full of people sexually assaulting or fighting one another. Roger combs the complex looking for the parasites while Forsythe—his nurse and lover—tends to an elderly couple who were attacked by one of the parasites.

Linsky arrives at Starliner Towers and goes to the Tudor apartment, as Roger had identified Nick as someone Annabelle might have infected. He finds Nick lying in bed, parasites crawling on his abdomen. When Linsky examines him more closely, one of the parasites latches onto his cheek. Linsky tries to pull it off with pliers, but Nick kills him and swallows the parasite. Forsythe tries to flee the complex in her car but is attacked by the infected security guard. Before he can rape her, Roger arrives and kills him, and the two hide in the basement. Forsythe tells Roger of a dream that mixed eroticism and death, then vomits up a parasite. Roger knocks her out and tries to carry her to safety, but they are attacked by a horde of infected sex maniacs. Roger is separated from Forsythe and is forced to flee as she is overwhelmed by the infected.

Roger kills Nick in his apartment, then tries to escape the complex, but is thwarted at every turn. He finally makes it to the swimming pool area where he encounters Janine and Betts swimming fully clothed. The two walk to the edge of the pool and smile seductively at him as he finds a door to the outside, but the infected block his path and he is pulled into the pool by Janine and Betts. The rest of the infected, including the little girl from the elevator, plunge into the pool fully dressed or otherwise and swim towards Roger to hold him down. Roger is eventually surrounded and finally infected by Forsythe.

Roger, Forsythe and the other Starliner residents drive out of the building&#x27;s garage. Early the next morning, news reports encourage listeners not to panic as police investigate an epidemic of sexual assaults in Montreal.

==Cast==
==Production==
After finishing &quot;Crimes of the Future&quot; David Cronenberg lived in Tourrettes-sur-Loup, France, where he shot filler for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation using a 16 mm camera he purchased with a Canada Council grant. During his time in France he went to the Cannes Film Festival where he realized that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t make movies like &quot;Stereo&quot; and &quot;Crimes&quot; and consider myself a professional film-maker&quot; and that he needed a broader audience. He returned to Canada and started work on &quot;Shivers&quot;.

Cronenberg joined Cinépix which he described as &quot;sleazy distributors, and I say that with great affection — my kind of people&quot;. Cinépix was attempting to enter the American market and John Dunning believed that Cronenberg&#x27;s film would aid them.

It took around three years to gain financial backing from the Canadian Film Development Corporation which viewed the movie as &quot;disgusting, awful, horrific, perverse&quot; according to Cronenberg. Jonathan Demme was offered the position of director. Cronenberg directed the film, but stated &quot;I had fifteen days to learn how to make a movie. I didn&#x27;t know how to make movies, just films.&quot; and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t know what the fuck was going on&quot; at his first production meeting. Ivan Reitman was appointed as a line producer.

The film was written under the titles &quot;The Parasite Complex&quot;, &quot;Starliner&quot;, and &quot;Orgy Of The Blood Parasites&quot;. It was shot at Nuns&#x27; Island from 21 August to 17 September 1974. The film was given a budget of $115,000, but cost $179,000 () with $76,500 coming from the CFDC. Dick Smith and Joe Blasco worked on effects and makeup for the film. It was shot at Tourelle-Sur-Rive, a 1962 apartment building designed by Mies van der Rohe. While filming, Lynn Lowry accidentally struck Cronenberg in the face with a cooking fork.

==Release==
The film was released as &quot;Shivers&quot; in Canada and the United Kingdom, &quot;The Parasite Murders&quot; and &quot;Frissons&quot; in Quebec, and &quot;They Came From Within&quot; in the United States. The film was released in Canada in Montreal by Cinépix on 10 October 1975, in English in three theatres and in French in seven theatres. Regional showings in the United States started in San Antonio, Texas, on September 26, 1975.

It was shown at the Cannes Film Market and the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 1975. &quot;Shivers&quot; and &quot;Rabid&quot; were re-released as a double feature in Paris in December 1994.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD by Image Entertainment on September 16, 1998. On September 15, 2020, Lionsgate issued the film on Blu-ray in the United States as part of its Vestron Video Collector&#x27;s Series. This release includes, among other features, a new commentary by Cronenberg.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of based on reviews from critics, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;&quot;Shivers&quot; uses elementally effective basic ingredients to brilliant and lays the profoundly unsettling foundation for director David Cronenberg&#x27;s career to follow&quot;.

Critical reaction to the initial release of the movie was negative, however. Of a selection of 28 reviews from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and France, 16 reviews were negative—12 of these very negative—versus 6 that were positive. Of the positive reviews, 3 were very positive. 6 reviews were neutral. Canadian critics such as Martin Knelman, in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, and Dane Larnken, in the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, gave the film negative reviews. American critic Roger Ebert noted that while he expected &quot;Shivers&quot; to be a dismal exploitation film, since it was part of a double bill with the purported snuff film &quot;Snuff&quot;, he instead was impressed by much of the movie. He gave it 2 stars.

Canadian journalist Robert Fulford previously praised Cronenberg&#x27;s prior film &quot;Stereo&quot;. However, Fulford, writing under the pseudonym Marshall Delaney, decried the content of &quot;Shivers&quot; in the national magazine &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Because Cronenberg&#x27;s film was partially financed by the taxpayer-funded CFDC, Fulford headlined the article with &quot;You should know how bad this film is. After all, you paid for it.&quot; He called it &quot;crammed with blood, violence and depraved sex&quot;, and &quot;the most repulsive movie I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Not only did this high-profile attack make it more difficult for Cronenberg to obtain funding for his subsequent movies it also resulted in him being kicked out of his apartment in Toronto according to Cronenberg, due to his landlord&#x27;s inclusion of a &quot;morality clause&quot; in the lease. The controversy over the sexual and violent content of &quot;Shivers&quot; grew to the point that the Parliament of Canada debated the film&#x27;s social and artistic value and effect upon society.

===Box office===
The film was successful in Quebec, but failed in the United States with Cronenberg blaming American International Pictures&#x27;s poor distribution. Multiple scenes were cut from the American release to prevent an X rating. The film earned around $5 million after a theatrical release in forty countries.

Making $1 million in Canada, &quot;Shivers&quot; was one of the highest-grossing English-language Canadian films of all time, and more profitable than any previous Canadian film. According to Cronenberg it was the first film funded by the CFDC to earn a profit.
