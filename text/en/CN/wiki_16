<text>James Ellis Hall (born July 23, 1935) is a retired American racing driver, race car constructor, and team owner. While he is best known as a car constructor, he was one of the greatest American racing drivers of his generation, capturing consecutive United States Road Racing Championships (1964, 1965), two Road America 500s (1962, 1964), two Watkins Glen Grands Prix for sports cars (1964, 1965), the 1965 Canadian Grand Prix for sports cars, the 1965 Pacific Northwest Grand Prix, and scoring a massive upset at the 1965 12 Hours of Sebring over a contingent of factory-backed Ford GTs, Shelby Daytona Coupes, and Ferrari entries. If anything Hall&#x27;s accomplishments behind the wheel have been overshadowed by his pivotal contributions to race car design through his series of Chaparral sports racing and Indy cars. Hall&#x27;s cars won in every series in which they competed: USRRC, Can-Am, Trans-Am, Formula 5000, World Sportscar Championship, Autoweek Championship, Canadian Sports Car Championship, and the Indianapolis 500.

==Background==
Hall was born in Abilene and raised in Colorado and New Mexico. While studying engineering at the California Institute of Technology, he began racing in local sports car events. After a promised job at General Motors to work on the Corvette failed to materialize due to a late ‘50s U.S. recession, he became involved with older brother Dick in Carroll Shelby Sport Cars in Dallas, the area’s leading importer of European road and race vehicles. This experience played a crucial role in his development as a driver and helped the dealership sell cars. Shelby would put Hall in one of the new racers and often as not, Hall would go out and win in it. Shelby would then brag that if a rookie could win in it, it must be a pretty outstanding piece of machinery. Soon, however, fans across the Southwest started to recognize that Hall was one of the most promising young drivers on the American racing scene.

Hall&#x27;s abilities drew international attention at the 1960 United States Grand Prix at Riverside. Driving his own past-its-prime Lotus-Climax, he ran a surprising fifth for much of the race until the differential started to give way a few laps from the end. Of Hall&#x27;s run, Competition Press (now Autoweek) wrote, “It looks as if Texas has another international caliber driver ready to take Carroll Shelby’s place now that Shelby has announced his retirement.”

At Riverside, Hall was approached by California car builders Troutman and Barnes who were seeking funding for a new front-mid-engined, two-seat road racer. Hall backed the project and named the vehicle Chaparral. He had success with the Chaparral 1, winning the Road America 500 and other races. Almost as soon as it was completed, Hall began thinking of a successor vehicle he would build himself.

==Influence==
Possibly no designer from the second half of the 20th century has had more enduring influence. Hall pioneered wings, movable aerodynamic devices, side-mounted radiators, semi-automatic transmissions, and composite monocoque chassis structures, all of them innovations later adopted by and still present in every Formula 1 car. He was one of the first to recognize and demonstrate the performance benefits of torsional rigidity. The chassis of his Chaparral 2 — it later became known as 2A to distinguish it from subsequent Chaparrals — was by design about four times stiffer than those of the leading sports cars of the day. Hall also introduced the world&#x27;s first constant downforce racecar, the 1970 Chaparral 2J, which used a snowmobile engine to power two fans to reduce the air pressure between the bottom of the car and the road regardless of vehicle speed. (Both wings and ground effect tunnels generate downforce that varies with vehicle speed.) At the 1970 Riverside Can-Am the 2J qualified more than two seconds faster than the championship-winning McLaren M8D. The 2J was also the first car equipped with vacuum-protecting “skirts,” another innovation later adopted by Formula 1. Although it was quickly banned, the 2J “vacuum cleaner” concept was copied eight years later by Brabham Formula 1 designer Gordon Murray who figured out a way to circumvent the rules. The resulting Brabham BT46B won the only race in which it was entered, the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, proving significantly faster than Colin Chapman&#x27;s ground effect-tunneled Lotus 79, which secured that year&#x27;s championship. The development of downforce, from spoilers on his Chaparral 2A to wings movable and otherwise on his Chaparral 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F, 2G, and 2H to the suction system on his 2J, was arguably Hall&#x27;s single greatest contribution to the sport and the one most copied. In 1979, Hall also became the first to bring ground effect tunnels to IndyCar racing with his groundbreaking Chaparral 2K. Today, because of Hall, downforce is part of the design brief for every major form of racing car — Formula 1, IndyCar, Le Mans, NHRA, NASCAR, World Rally Championship cars, and more — and most high-performance road cars.

&quot;When you put an aerodynamic downforce on a car, it increases the traction and allows it to corner at a much faster speed than it did before,” says Hall. &quot;So that’s really what Chaparral did over a period of years in various ways, and that one idea had a tremendous effect on the future of auto racing.”

==Driver and constructor==
The first of the true Jim Hall Chaparrals was built in Midland, Texas during 1962 and 1963. At the same time Colin Chapman was building the first monocoque Formula 1 car, Hall was developing a monocoque sports racer of his own design made of composites. He and partner Hap Sharp had scouted the nation&#x27;s leading aerospace companies for the latest advances in construction techniques. At General Dynamics they met Andy Green, who was designing fiberglass engine fairings for the Convair B-58 Hustler, the world&#x27;s first supersonic bomber. They hired Green to apply the same advanced fiberglass composite technology to create the first successful full composite racecar monocoque. The advantages of the plastic chassis were twofold: it was much more rigid than traditional chassis, which greatly aided handling, and lighter, aiding performance in all dimensions. When Hall met people from Chevrolet Research &amp; Development, GM&#x27;s own internal skunkworks, at the 1962 June Sprints at Road America, they picked each other&#x27;s brains for new ideas. One result was the adoption of a semi-automatic “torque converter” gearbox.

Today, semi-automatic gearboxes are commonplace in racing, but when Hall introduced them — and won with them — onlookers and rivals alike were mystified. Here again Hall&#x27;s engineering background came into play. “Not only is there literally less work to do,” Hall explained in an article he wrote for &quot;Autocar&quot; in 1965, “we can keep both hands on the steering wheel, at all times concentrating entirely on exact placing of the car in a turn and just when and how much to brake. Another value is the reliability it induces in other components. It is not possible to over-rev the engine or damage the drive train with shock loads from mismatched shifts and other poor driving techniques.”
The car that came to be known as the Chaparral 2A might have been completed sooner, but another outstanding driving performance, this time at the 1962 season-ending Mexican Grand Prix, led the British Racing Partnership (BRP) Formula 1 team to offer him a seat for the 1963 season. Hall accepted the offer, but neither the team nor Hall realized that BRP, which had scored wins in previous seasons, was on the verge of decline. Nevertheless, Hall managed to accumulate three World Championship points. His best finish was fifth in the 1963 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, his first time at the fabled track.

While he was in Europe, work continued on the 2A at the small complex in Midland that he co-owned with partner Hap Sharp. Midland was far away from established racing infrastructure but next to the aptly named Rattlesnake Raceway that Hall and Sharp used as a proving ground.

Once it was finished, it proved a revelation. Hall put it on the pole at its first race, the October, 1963 Los Angeles Times Grand Prix, over an international-class field that included soon-to-be F1 champions Jim Clark, Graham Hill, and John Surtees, and future Motorsports Hall of Fame of America legends Dan Gurney, A. J. Foyt, Roger Penske, Lloyd Ruby, Parnelli Jones, Rodger Ward, and Richie Ginther. Hall led easily until sidelined by an electrical fire.

During the 1964 and 1965 seasons, Hall and Sharp (and fill-in Penske, after Hall was injured in an accident at Mosport) dominated American sports car racing in their Chaparral 2As and later 2Cs (there was no Chaparral 2B, to avoid confusion with a General Motors-designed Corvette GS IIB sports racing concept) to a degree no one has before or since. In 1965 alone, in 22 starts in major races against topnotch international competition, Chaparrals collected 16 wins and 16 fastest laps. Hall won the 1964 USRRC title outright and the unlimited class title in 1965.

The team had generated even bigger headlines earlier in the year at the 12 Hours of Sebring. Hall and Sharp put their Chaparral 2A on pole an astonishing 9 seconds faster than reigning World Champion John Surtees had managed the previous year in the top factory Ferrari. Still, few expected the Chaparrals to be able to survive the onslaught of factory-supported Fords and Ferraris, much less the wear and tear of 12 hours of racing on the punishing Sebring runway course. Ford had seven cars, driven by the likes of Dan Gurney, Ken Miles, Bruce McLaren, Richie Ginther, and Phil Hill. The lead Ferrari was driven by endurance racing specialist Pedro Rodriguez and 1962 World Champion Graham Hill. Still, Hall&#x27;s Chaparral prevailed, overcoming the world&#x27;s best endurance racers and monsoon-like conditions.

Probably the most influential of Hall&#x27;s designs was the Chaparral 2E prepared for the following year&#x27;s inaugural season of Canadian-American Challenge Cup competition. The Chaparral 2E featured side-mounted radiators, a semi-automatic gearbox and other innovations, but what people noticed most was the massive articulated wing mounted on pillars that soared several feet above the rear deck. Said fellow competitor, broadcaster and racing historian Sam Posey, “When those cars arrived on their double-axle trailers in the paddock at Bridgehampton, people just stopped everything and their jaws dropped down on the ground. Nothing in the world existed like that. The two cars went out and the world changed and we were part of it.&quot;

Hall had innovated movable aerodynamic devices with a low-mounted wing on the back of the Chaparral 2C. The 2C won major races, but the wing was deployed more as an adjustable spoiler and worked on the rear of the car only, upsetting the car&#x27;s balance at the same time it was providing crucial downforce. For the 2E, Hall used a symmetrical wing that would create minimal drag in the neutral position, but substantial downforce when tilted downward in the turns. To balance the effect, the 2E also had an adjustable duct in the nose. Both devices were connected to a pedal in the cockpit. Because the semi-automatic Chaparrals only needed a gas pedal and a brake pedal, the driver&#x27;s left foot was available to activate the “downforce” pedal. “With the wing,” said Chaparral driver Phil Hill, “you could out-brake everybody, you could out-corner everybody, [and] you could drive under them. It really did feel like it had freak roadholding.”

The 2E was demonstrably the fastest car of the inaugural Can-Am season but reliability issues with the new design kept the team from converting its many poles and fastest laps into victories. The 2E missed the first of the season&#x27;s six races because the wing wasn&#x27;t yet ready, and won only one of the remaining five, with Hill and Hall finishing 1–2 at the Laguna Seca round where the cars performed flawlessly.

That same year the small team in Midland converted two of the older chassis for use in endurance racing&#x27;s World Sportscar Championship. The first iteration — the Chaparral 2D coupe — won the 1966 Nürburgring 1000 kilometers. The second, the more angular Chaparral 2F, which featured a wing and nose duct similar to the 2E, captured the BOAC International 500 at Brands Hatch. There, drivers Phil Hill and Mike Spence led home a Ferrari 330 P4 driven by Grand Prix aces Jackie Stewart and Chris Amon.

“I’m really proud that we were able to pull off those wins at the Nürburgring and at Brands Hatch,” Hall told &quot;Motor Sport&quot; years later. “That was a really fun deal. Somebody told me after we won at the Nürburgring that it was the first American car to win a major European road race in 40 years and I thought, ‘Wow!’”

A sign of the now worldwide respect for Hall’s driving talent came in May of 1968 when Spence was killed at Indy in a freak practice accident at the wheel of one of Chapman’s revolutionary Lotus 56 turbine cars. The original three drivers nominated for the race were a virtual “super team:” two-time World Champion Jim Clark, soon-to-be two-time World Champion Graham Hill and eventual three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart. After both Clark and his replacement, Spence, were killed and Stewart injured in separate accidents, the team turned to Hall, even though he had never driven an Indy car before. Hall declined.

It was in another development of the 2E, called 2G, that Hall&#x27;s driving career came to a premature end. At 1968&#x27;s season-ending Las Vegas Can-Am, Hall was about to unlap himself after an unscheduled pit stop from second-place man Lothar Motschenbacher when the latter&#x27;s McLaren suffered a catastrophic suspension failure. Hall&#x27;s Chaparral leap-frogged the stricken McLaren at over 100 MPH and came crashing down in the desert. Hall survived, but his knees in particular were badly damaged. It was six months before he could walk again. He made a brief return to racing during the 1970 Trans-Am season in his team&#x27;s own works Camaro effort, but while the speed was still there for laps at a time, he could no longer maintain his previous pace over a race distance.

That same year Hall introduced his final Can-Am challenger, the suction ground effect Chaparral 2J, which was comprehensively faster than every other car in the series. Even though the SCCA had declared it legal before and after the season, other teams lobbied against it and finally persuaded the FIA, the worldwide sanctioning body, to ban it. Disgusted, Hall left the series and quit racing as a whole. Years later, Can-Am&#x27;s all-time winning driver Denny Hulme, part of the McLaren team that spearheaded the effort to ban the 2J, said, “It was the most stupid thing we ever did, and it was the first major step we took toward killing off the greatest road racing series ever conceived.”

==Team manager==
After Hall had been away from the sport for several years, Lola importer Carl Haas approached him with a proposition: Let&#x27;s go Indy car racing. Haas would provide the sponsors and cars (Lolas), Hall could concentrate on running the team. That appealed to Hall and the pair formed Haas-Hall Racing. When the money to go to Indy didn&#x27;t materialize, they switched to the SCCA Formula 5000 open-wheel series.

Haas-Hall racing was virtually unstoppable throughout the decade, winning three consecutive F5000 titles with Brian Redman at the wheel until the series evolved into the second-generation Can-Am, whereupon the team won four more championships. Between the two series, from 1974 through 1980, the partnership collected seven consecutive series titles.

Near the end of the run, the sponsorship to go to Indy did materialize, and Hall began to focus on that arena. The results again were immediate. In 1978, the team&#x27;s initial season of Indy car competition, it became the first and still only team to capture Indy car racing&#x27;s Triple Crown, with victories at the Indianapolis 500, Pocono 500, and California 500.

The successes in the long-distance races hid the shortcomings of the Lola chassis, so Hall decided to take one last stab at car building. He commissioned up-and-coming designer John Barnard to realize his vision of a new kind of Indy car based on the ground effect principle introduced on Colin Chapman&#x27;s Lotus 78. The resulting Chaparral 2K, nicknamed the “Yellow Submarine” thanks to sponsor Pennzoil&#x27;s brand colors, changed the face of Indy car racing. The first Indy “tunnel car” dominated the 1979 Indianapolis 500 in Al Unser&#x27;s hands until sidelined by a transmission issue. It came back the following year and not only won the 500, but captured the 1980 CART PPG Indy Car World Series championship as well with Johnny Rutherford at the helm.

After the 1981 season, Hall remained in Indy car racing off and on with store-bought Lola and Reynard chassis and collected more wins and high finishes with a variety of drivers, including John Andretti and Gil de Ferran. Hall retired from the sport after the 1996 campaign.

==In popular culture==
During the 1960s, Hall&#x27;s popularity transcended the automotive enthusiast press, where he and his cars were regular subjects. Both &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; did cover stories. Shell featured him in their advertising. Coca-Cola put him in a TV commercial.

He was an even bigger presence in homes across the United States thanks to a groundbreaking deal with Cox Models, a Santa Ana, California based slot car manufacturer. Cox licensed the rights to reproduce Chaparral cars at the height of the slot car craze. According to slot car expert Philippe de Lespinay, the “Jim Hall Authorized” Cox Chaparrals were the most popular 1/24-scale slot cars of all time. So enthralled were American kids with Hall and his cars that when they created the Chaparral 2A slot car, Cox had the sculptor model the driver&#x27;s face to look like Hall.

==Legacy==
An entire wing of the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland is devoted to Hall and the Chaparral story, and includes seven of the restored race cars: a 2A, 2D, 2E, 2F, 2H, 2J, and 2K. Each of the cars is driven periodically to maintain them in working condition and to provide the public a chance to see them in action.

Hall and his cars have been featured at most of the major concours and vintage racing events. He was named grand marshal of the 2001 Brian Redman International Challenge at Road America, and Hall and his Chaparrals were featured at the 2003 Amelia Island Concours d&#x27;Elegance and 2005 Monterey Historic Automobile Races. Internationally, Hall and his Chaparrals are regular invitees at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

At the season-ending Laguna Seca round of the 2009 American Le Mans Series, former driver Gil de Ferran painted his Acura ARX-02a to resemble a Chaparral in tribute to Hall, complete with Hall&#x27;s race number, 66. In storybook fashion, de Ferran put the car on pole and won the race with co-driver and 2019 Indianapolis 500 winner Simon Pagenaud.

At the 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show General Motors debuted the Chaparral 2X, a futuristic homage to the Chaparral ethos, “developed exclusively for fans of the PlayStation® 3 racing game, Gran Turismo® 6.” The concept was emblazoned with Hall&#x27;s racing number and according to the game maker, captured “the spirit of Jim Hall’s amazing legacy of motorsports innovation.”

<text>Per Nørgård (; born 13 July 1932) is a Danish composer and music theorist. Though his style has varied considerably throughout his career, his music has often included repeatedly evolving melodies—such as the infinity series—in the vein of Jean Sibelius, and a perspicuous focus on lyricism. Reflecting on this, the composer Julian Anderson described his style as &quot;one of the most personal in contemporary music&quot;. Nørgård has received several awards, including the 2016 Ernst von Siemens Music Prize.

==Life and career==
Per Nørgård was born in Gentofte, Denmark in 1932. He studied with Vagn Holmboe privately at age 17, and then formally at Royal Danish Academy of Music, Copenhagen, with Holmboe, Harald Høffding and Herman David Koppel. From 1956 to 1957, he subsequently studied in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, who had taught many leading composers of the time. Nørgård soon gained his own teaching positions, first at the Odense Conservatory in 1958, and then at the Royal Danish Conservatory of Music in 1960. His students at the latter included the composer Carl Davis. Between 1958 and 1962, Nørgård had a stint as a music critic for the newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot;. He left these positions to teach composition at the Royal Academy of Music, Aarhus/Aalborg in 1965. Here he taught many composers who would go on to have major careers, including Hans Abrahamsen, Hans Gefors, Karl Aage Rasmussen, Bent Sørensen,

To begin with, he was strongly influenced by the Nordic styles of Jean Sibelius, Carl Nielsen and Vagn Holmboe. In the 1960s, Nørgård began exploring the modernist techniques of central Europe, eventually developing a serial compositional system based on the &quot;infinity series&quot;, which he used in his &quot;Voyage into the Golden Screen&quot;, the Second and Third Symphonies, &quot;I Ching&quot;, and other works of the late 1960s and 70s. Later he became interested in the Swiss artist Adolf Wölfli, who inspired many of Nørgård&#x27;s works, including the Fourth Symphony, the opera &quot;Det Guddommelige Tivoli&quot; and &quot;Papalagi&quot; for solo guitar.

Nørgård has composed works in all major genres: six operas, two ballets, eight symphonies and other pieces for orchestra, several concertos, choral and vocal works, a very large number of chamber works (among them ten string quartets) and several solo instrumental works. These include a number of works for the guitar, mostly written for the Danish guitarist Erling Møldrup: &quot;In Memory Of...&quot; (1978), &quot;Papalagi&quot; (1981), a series of suites called &quot;Tales from a Hand&quot; (1985–2001), &quot;Early Morn&quot; (1997–98) and &quot;Rondino Amorino&quot; (1999). One of his most important works for percussion solo is &quot;I Ching&quot; (1982) for the Danish percussionist Gert Mortensen. He has also composed music for several films, including &quot;The Red Cloak&quot; (1966), &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot; (1987), and &quot;Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot; (1993).

His eighth symphony was premiered on 19 September 2012 in the Helsinki Music Centre, Finland, by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by John Storgårds. Heikki Valska from the Finnish radio described the symphony as &quot;very bright and lyrical&quot; and &quot;approachable&quot;. It was well received by the audience at the premiere. It was later recorded by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sakari Oramo.

Nørgård is also a prolific writer. He has written many articles dealing with music not only from a technical but also a philosophical viewpoint.

== Infinity series ==

Nørgård&#x27;s music often features the use of the infinity series (Danish &quot;Uendelighedsrækken&quot;) for serializing melody, harmony, and rhythm in musical composition. The method takes its name from the endlessly self-similar nature of the resulting musical material, comparable to fractal geometry. Mathematically, the infinity series is an integer sequence. &quot;Invented in an attempt to unify in a perfect way repetition and variation,&quot; the first few terms of its simplest form are 0, 1, −1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, −2, 3, ….

Nørgård discovered the melodic infinity series in 1959 and it proved an inspiration for many of his works during the 1960s. However, it was not until his &quot;Voyage into the Golden Screen&quot; for small ensemble (1968)—which has been identified as the first &quot;properly instrumental piece of spectral composition&quot; —and Symphony No. 2 (1970) that it provided the structure for an entire work. The harmonic and rhythmic infinity series were developed in the early 1970s and the three series were first integrated in Nørgård&#x27;s Symphony No. 3.

<text>John Bates Clark (January 26, 1847 – March 21, 1938) was an American neoclassical economist. He was one of the pioneers of the marginalist revolution and opponent to the Institutionalist school of economics, and spent most of his career as a professor at Columbia University. He was one of the most prominent American economists of his time.

==Biography==
Clark was born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island, and graduated from Amherst College, in Massachusetts, at the age of 25. From 1872 to 1875, he attended the University of Zurich and the University of Heidelberg where he studied under Karl Knies (a leader of the German Historical School). He taught as a professor of economics at Carleton College from 1875 to 1881 before moving east to teach at Smith College. He subsequently taught at Amherst College, Johns Hopkins University, and Columbia University. Early in his career Clark&#x27;s writings reflected his German Socialist background and showed him as a critic of capitalism. During his time as a professor at Columbia University however, his views gradually shifted to support of capitalism and he later became known as a leading advocate of the capitalist system. Clark was the father of economist John Maurice Clark.

==Theoretical work==

After his return, from 1877 onward, Clark published several articles most of them edited later in &quot;The Philosophy of Wealth&quot; (1886). There he formulated an original version of marginal utility theory, principle already published by Jevons (1871), Menger (1871), and Walras (1878).

Until 1886 Clark was a Christian socialist reflecting the view of his German teachers that competition is no universal remedy – especially not for fixing wages. Clark writes:

It is a dangerous mistake to extol competition, as such too highly, and regard all attacks upon it as revolutionary. … We do not eat men … but we do it by such indirect and refined methods that it does not generally occur to us that we are cannibals.

He hoped that communism could be combatted by suppression &quot;and&quot; reform:

Among the adherents of Communism there is a large element that is simply murderous, and this deserves only the murderer&#x27;s fate. ... It is possible that an indefinitely large proportion of declared communists in this country may be of worthless or criminal character.

According to Clark only if &quot;...the union of capital necessitates the union of labour&quot; just wages will come about and may be fixed by arbitration.

This view on fair wages changed in 1886: &quot;Clark himself, it will be remembered has song down the doom of competition in &quot;The Philosophy of Wealth&quot;. But now … he has reversed his position and build[s] up a body of economic laws based on competition&quot; writes Homan (1928) and Everett (1946) finds: &quot;Soon after writing &quot;The Philosophy of Wealth&quot;, however, Clark started to make defences for the competitive system. What caused the change is unknown. This much we can say. By the time he wrote The Distribution of Wealth he was convinced that pure competition was the natural and normal law by which the economic order obtained justice.&quot; One cause that prompted this reorientation could be the Haymarket Riot (1886) in Chicago when some strikers were shot and others hanged. In the US it resulted in a cleansing of higher education from &quot;socialist&quot; reformers and the ruin of the Knights of Labor.

In 1888 Clark wrote &quot;Capital and Its Earnings&quot;. Frank Fetter later reflected on Bates&#x27; motivation for writing this work:

The probable source from which immediate stimulation came to Clark was the contemporary single tax discussion. ... Events were just at that time crowding each other fast in the single tax propaganda. Henry George&#x27;s] &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;... had a larger sale than any other book ever written by an American. ... No other economic subject at the time was comparable in importance in the public eye with the doctrine of &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;. &quot;Capital and its Earnings&quot; &quot;... wears the mien of pure theory ... But ... one can hardly fail to see on almost every page the reflections of the contemporary single-tax discussion. In the brief preface is expressed the hope that &#x27;it may be found that these principles settle questions of agrarian socialism.&#x27; Repeatedly the discussion turns to &#x27;the capital that vests itself in land,&#x27;...
The foundation of Clark&#x27;s further work was competition: &quot;If nothing suppresses competition, progress will continue forever&quot;. Clark: &quot;The science adapted … is economic Darwinism. … Though the process was savage, the outlook which it afforded was not wholly evil. The survival of crude strength was, in the long run, desirable&quot;. This was the fundament to develop the theory which made him famous: Given competition and homogeneous factors of production &quot;labor&quot; and &quot;capital&quot;, the repartition of the social product will be according to the productivity of the last physical input of units of &quot;labor&quot; and &quot;capital&quot;. This theorem is a cornerstone of neoclassical microeconomics. Clark stated it in 1891 and more elaborated 1899 in &quot;The Distribution of Wealth&quot;. The same theorem was formulated later independently by John Atkinson Hobson (1891) and Philip Wicksteed (1894). The political message of this theorem is: &quot;[W]hat a social class gets is, under natural law, what it contributes to the general output of industry.&quot;

Clark&#x27;s conclusion rests upon the productive contribution of the last unit of physical labour – one hour unqualified labour – and the last unit of physical capital. To him heterogeneous capital goods have a second, a social form as homogeneous capital (called &quot;jelly&quot; as a street can be moulded into an engine) and the productivity of the last unit of &quot;jelly&quot; determines &quot;profit&quot;. This retakes Karl Marx&#x27;s view that commodities have a heterogeneous natural form () and also opposed to it a homogenous value-form (), &quot;jelly&quot;. Clark might have known this Marxian construction from his German time and was reproached for this similarity.

Clark&#x27;s capital are not &quot;produced means of production&quot; each with a different production structure. It is an abstract, always existing and never perishing &quot;one great tool in the hand of working humanity&quot; similar to a field or a waterfall, also considered capital by Clark.

The arguable sides of Clark&#x27;s notion of capital helped to give rise to the Cambridge capital controversy from 1954 to 1965 between the departments of economics at Cambridge University, England, and at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Paul A. Samuelson&#x27;s classic 1947 textbook, &quot;Economics&quot;, disseminated Clark&#x27;s concept of capital worldwide.

<text>Sir Arthur Harden, FRS (12 October 1865 – 17 June 1940) was a British biochemist. He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1929 with Hans Karl August Simon von Euler-Chelpin for their investigations into the fermentation of sugar and fermentative enzymes. He was a founding member of the Biochemical Society and editor of the &quot;Biochemical Journal&quot; for 25 years.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Harden was born to Scottish Presbyterian businessman Albert Tyas Harden and Eliza Macalister. His early education was at a private school in Victoria Park run by Dr Ernest Adam. He went to study in 1877 at Tettenhall College, Staffordshire, and entered Owens College, now the University of Manchester, in 1882, graduating in 1885. He studied chemistry under Professor Roscoe at Owens College and was influenced by J.B. Cohen (author of &quot;The Owens College Course of Practical Organic Chemistry&quot;).

===Research===
In 1886 Harden was awarded the Dalton Scholarship in Chemistry and spent a year working with Otto Fischer at Erlangen where he worked on the synthesis of β-nitroso-α-naphthylamine and studied its properties. After receiving a Ph.D. he returned to Manchester as a lecturer and demonstrator and taught along with Sir Philip Hartog. He researched the life and work of John Dalton during these years. In 1895 he wrote a textbook on &quot;Practical Organic Chemistry&quot; together with F.C. Garrett. Harden continued to work at Manchester until 1897 when he was appointed chemist to the newly founded British Institute of Preventive Medicine, which later became the Lister Institute. He earned the degree Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) from the Victoria University (which included Owens College) in June 1902. Five years later, in 1907 he was appointed Head of the Biochemical Department, a position which he held until his retirement in 1930 (though he continued his scientific work at the Institute after his retirement).

At Manchester, Harden had studied the action of light on mixtures of carbon dioxide and chlorine, and when he entered the Institute he applied his methods to the investigation of biological phenomena such as the chemical action of bacteria and alcoholic fermentation. He studied the breakdown products of glucose and the chemistry of the yeast cell, and produced a series of papers on the antiscorbutic and anti-neuritic vitamins.

Harden was knighted in 1926, and received several honorary doctorates. A Fellow of the Royal Society, he received the Davy Medal in 1935.

====&quot;Harden–Young ester&quot;====

Harden&#x27;s work on glycolysis in yeast with William John Young led to the discovery of a phosphorylated ester that was known as &quot;Harden–Young ester&quot; until chemical analysis showed it to be fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. It is now known to be the product of phosphorylating fructose 6-phosphate by the action of phosphofructokinase; it is broken down into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate by the action of aldolase.

===Personal life ===
Harden married Georgina Sydney Bridge (died January 1928) in 1900 and they had no children.

<text>Sir John (Jack) Harold Plumb (20 August 1911 – 21 October 2001) was a British historian, known for his books on British 18th-century history.

==Biography==
Plumb was born in Leicester on 20 August 1911. He was educated at Alderman Newton&#x27;s School, Leicester, then at University College, Leicester (BA Lond. 1933) and finally at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge (PhD 1936). His doctoral thesis, on the social structure of the House of Commons at the time of William III, was supervised by G. M. Trevelyan, the only time that Trevelyan is believed to have taken on that role. In 1939, Plumb was elected to the Ehrman Fellowship, which was a research fellowship at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

During the Second World War, Plumb worked in the codebreaking department of the Foreign Office at Bletchley Park, Hut 8 and Hut 4, later Block B. He headed a section working on a German Navy hand cipher, &quot;Reservehandverfahren&quot;.

In 1946, he became a Fellow and Tutor of Christ&#x27;s College and a University Lecturer in History. In 1957, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Letters for his work on 18th-century history, and in 1962, he was appointed Reader in Modern History at Cambridge University. He became Professor of Modern English History in the University in 1966. He served as Master of Christ&#x27;s College from 1978 to 1982.

He had a visiting professorship at Columbia University in 1960. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1968 and knighted in 1982.

Plumb was the European Advisory Editor for &quot;Horizon&quot;, and the advisory editor for history for Penguin Books. In the 1960s he branched out as an editor, notably working on &quot;The History of Human Society&quot; series. Contributors to his books included other well-known historians like Morris Bishop, Jacob Bronowski, and Maria Bellonci. Later Plumb worked with Huw Wheldon on the BBC television series &quot;Royal Heritage&quot; about the British Royal family and the Royal Collections first broadcast in 1977.

An obituary in the &quot;New York Times&quot; observed that from the 23 books that he wrote between 1950 and 1973, Plumb became wealthy enough to &quot;indulge his taste for fine food and wine;&quot; to build a collection of rare porcelain; to drive a Rolls-Royce; and to live in a &quot;16th-century rectory in Suffolk, a mill in the south of France and a Manhattan pied-à-terre in the Carlyle Hotel.&quot;

==Influence==
Plumb is seen as mentor to a school of historians, having in common a wish to write accessible, broad-based work for the public: a generation of scholars that includes Roy Porter, Simon Schama, Linda Colley, David Cannadine and others who came to prominence in the 1990s. He was champion of a &#x27;social history&#x27; in a wide sense; he backed this up with a connoisseur&#x27;s knowledge of some fields of the fine arts, such as Flemish painting and porcelain. This approach rubbed off on those he influenced, while he clashed unrepentantly with other historians (notably Cambridge colleague Geoffrey Elton) with a perspective from constitutional history whose emphasis was on more traditional scholarship.

Friends from his early life, C. P. Snow and William Cooper, portrayed him in novels; he also is known to be the model for a character in an Angus Wilson short story &quot;The Wrong Set&quot;.

<text>Hanna Rovina (‎; 15 September 1888 – 3 February 1980), also Robina, was an Israeli actress. She is often referred to as the &quot;First Lady of Hebrew Theatre&quot;.

==Biography==
Hana Rovina was born in Byerazino, in the Igumensky Uyezd of the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus), to David Rubin, a timber merchant and Sarah-Rivka Rubin. She had one sister, Rahel and one brother, Zvi. She trained as a kindergarten teacher at a course for Hebrew-speaking kindergarten teachers in Warsaw (prior to the First World War).

She had a daughter, Ilana, born in 1934, with the Hebrew poet Alexander Penn.

==Acting career==
She began her acting career at the &quot;Hebrew Stage Theatre&quot; of Nahum Tzemach. She joined Habima Theatre in 1917 just as it was being launched, and participated in its first production, a play by Yevgeny Vakhtangov. She became famous for her role as Leah&#x27;le, the young bride who is possessed by a demon in &quot;The Dybbuk&quot; by S. Ansky.

In 1928, Rovina and the other actors of Habima immigrated to Mandate Palestine. Habima became the flagship of the new national theatre movement, and Rovina was recognized as the movement&#x27;s leading actress. The image of Rovina in her role as Leah in the Moscow performance of &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;, in a white dress, with her long black braid, became an icon of the emergent Hebrew theatre.
Rovina took her acting very seriously and tried to live the life of the character, as prescribed by the Stanislavski School.

Nisim Aloni wrote a play, &quot;Aunt Liza&quot;, especially for her and Rovina played the lead.

Rovina made high demands of her audience. She frequently stopped a play in the middle if she felt that the audience was not attentive enough. In one instance, she stopped the play &quot;Hannah Senesh&quot; in the middle of a scene and told the teenagers in the hall to stop eating sunflower seeds. 

==Awards and recognition==
Rovina was awarded the Israel Prize for theatre in 1956. She remained active on stage until her death, in 1980. She died in Ra&#x27;anana, aged 91.

<doc id="1233715" wikidata="Q648511" url="?curid=1233715" title="Median voter theorem">
<text>In political science and social choice, the median voter theorem states that if voters and candidates are distributed along a one-dimensional spectrum and voters have single-peaked preferences, any voting method that is compatible with majority-rule will elect the candidate preferred by the median voter.

The theorem was first set out by Duncan Black in 1948. He wrote that he saw a large gap in economic theory concerning how voting determines the outcome of decisions, including political decisions. Black&#x27;s paper triggered research on how economics can explain voting systems.

A different argument due to Anthony Downs and Harold Hotelling is only loosely-related to Black&#x27;s median voter theorem, but is often confused with it. This model argues that politicians in a representative democracy will converge to the viewpoint of the median voter, because the median voter theorem implies that a candidate who wishes to win will adopt the positions of the median voter. However, this argument only applies to systems satisfying the median voter property, and cannot be applied to systems like ranked choice voting (RCV) or plurality voting outside of limited conditions (see ).

==Statement and proof of the theorem==
 
Say there is an election where candidates and voters have opinions distributed along a one-dimensional political spectrum. Voters rank candidates by proximity, i.e. the closest candidate is their first preference, the second-closest is their second preference, and so on. Then, the median voter theorem says that the candidate closest to the median voter is a &quot;majority-preferred&quot; (or &quot;Condorcet&quot;) candidate. In other words, this candidate preferred to any one of their opponents by a majority of voters. When there are only two candidates, a simple majority vote satisfies this condition, while for multi-candidate votes any majority-rule (Condorcet) method will satisfy it.

Proof sketch: Let the median voter be Marlene. The candidate who is closest to her will receive her first preference vote. Suppose that this candidate is Charles and that he lies to her left. Marlene and all voters to her left (by definition a majority of the electorate) will prefer Charles to all candidates to his right, and Marlene and all voters to her right (also a majority) will prefer Charles to all candidates to his left. 

* The assumption that preferences are cast in order of proximity can be relaxed to say merely that they are single-peaked.
* The assumption that opinions lie along a real line can be relaxed to allow more general topologies.
* Spatial / valence models: Suppose that each candidate has a &quot;valence&quot; (attractiveness) in addition to his or her position in space, and suppose that voter &quot;i&quot; ranks candidates &quot;j&quot; in decreasing order of &quot;vj&quot; – &quot;dij&quot; where &quot;vj&quot; is &quot;j&quot; &#x27;s valence and &quot;dij&quot; is the distance from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot;. Then the median voter theorem still applies: Condorcet methods will elect the candidate voted for by the median voter.

===The median voter property===
We will say that a voting method has the &quot;median voter property in one dimension&quot; if it always elects the candidate closest to the median voter under a one-dimensional spatial model. We may summarize the median voter theorem as saying that all Condorcet methods possess the median voter property in one dimension.

It turns out that Condorcet methods are not unique in this: Coombs&#x27; method is not Condorcet-consistent but nonetheless satisfies the median voter property in one dimension. Approval voting satisfies the same property under several models of strategic voting.

== Extensions to higher dimensions ==
It is impossible to fully generalize the median voter theorem to spatial models in more than one dimension, as there is no longer a single unique &quot;median&quot; for all possible distributions of voters. However, it is still possible to demonstrate similar theorems under some limited conditions.


The table shows an example of an election given by the Marquis de Condorcet, who concluded it showed a problem with the Borda count. The Condorcet winner on the left is A, who is preferred to B by 41:40 and to C by 60:21. The Borda winner is instead B. However, Donald Saari constructs an example in two dimensions where the Borda count (but not the Condorcet winner) correctly identifies the candidate closest to the center (as determined by the geometric median).

The diagram shows a possible configuration of the voters and candidates consistent with the ballots, with the voters positioned on the circumference of a unit circle. In this case, A&#x27;s mean absolute deviation is 1.15, whereas B&#x27;s is 1.09 (and C&#x27;s is 1.70), making B the spatial winner.

Thus the election is ambiguous in that two different spatial representations imply two different optimal winners. This is the ambiguity we sought to avoid earlier by adopting a median metric for spatial models; but although the median metric achieves its aim in a single dimension, the property does not fully generalize to higher dimensions.

=== Omnidirectional medians ===
Despite this result, the median voter theorem can be applied to distributions that are rotationally symmetric, e.g. Gaussians, which have a single median that is the same in all directions. Whenever the distribution of voters has a unique median in all directions, and voters rank candidates in order of proximity, the median voter theorem applies: the candidate closest to the median will have a majority preference over all his or her rivals, and will be elected by any voting method satisfying the median voter property in one dimension.

It follows that all median voter methods satisfy the same property in spaces of any dimension, for voter distributions with omnidirectional medians.

It is easy to construct voter distributions which do not have a median in all directions. The simplest example consists of a distribution limited to 3 points not lying in a straight line, such as 1, 2 and 3 in the second diagram. Each voter location coincides with the median under a certain set of one-dimensional projections. If A, B and C are the candidates, then &#x27;1&#x27; will vote A-B-C, &#x27;2&#x27; will vote B-C-A, and &#x27;3&#x27; will vote C-A-B, giving a Condorcet cycle. This is the subject of the McKelvey–Schofield theorem.

Proof. See the diagram, in which the grey disc represents the voter distribution as uniform over a circle and M is the median in all directions. Let A and B be two candidates, of whom A is the closer to the median. Then the voters who rank A above B are precisely the ones to the left (i.e. the &#x27;A&#x27; side) of the solid red line; and since A is closer than B to M, the median is also to the left of this line.

Now, since M is a median in all directions, it coincides with the one-dimensional median in the particular case of the direction shown by the blue arrow, which is perpendicular to the solid red line. Thus if we draw a broken red line through M, perpendicular to the blue arrow, then we can say that half the voters lie to the left of this line. But since this line is itself to the left of the solid red line, it follows that more than half of the voters will rank A above B.

===Relation between the median in all directions and the geometric median===
Whenever a unique omnidirectional median exists, it determines the result of Condorcet voting methods. At the same time the geometric median can arguably be identified as the ideal winner of a ranked preference election. It is therefore important to know the relationship between the two. In fact whenever a median in all directions exists (at least for the case of discrete distributions), it coincides with the geometric median.

Lemma. Whenever a discrete distribution has a median &quot;M&quot;  in all directions, the data points not located at &quot;M&quot;  must come in balanced pairs (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;A&quot; &#x27; ) on either side of &quot;M&quot;  with the property that &quot;A&quot; – &quot;M&quot; – &quot;A&quot; &#x27; is a straight line (ie. &quot;not&quot; like &quot;A&quot; 0 – &quot;M&quot; – &quot;A&quot; 2 in the diagram).

Proof. This result was proved algebraically by Charles Plott in 1967. Here we give a simple geometric proof by contradiction in two dimensions.

Suppose, on the contrary, that there is a set of points &quot;Ai&quot; which have &quot;M&quot;  as median in all directions, but for which the points not coincident with &quot;M&quot;  do not come in balanced pairs. Then we may remove from this set any points at &quot;M&quot;, and any balanced pairs about &quot;M&quot;, without &quot;M&quot;  ceasing to be a median in any direction; so &quot;M&quot;  remains an omnidirectional median.

If the number of remaining points is odd, then we can easily draw a line through &quot;M&quot;  such that the majority of points lie on one side of it, contradicting the median property of &quot;M&quot;.

If the number is even, say 2&quot;n&quot;, then we can label the points &quot;A&quot; 0, &quot;A&quot;1... in clockwise order about &quot;M&quot;  starting at any point (see the diagram). Let θ be the angle subtended by the arc from &quot;M&quot; –&quot;A&quot; 0 to &quot;M&quot; –&quot;A&quot; &quot;n&quot; . Then if θ &lt; 180° as shown, we can draw a line similar to the broken red line through &quot;M&quot;  which has the majority of data points on one side of it, again contradicting the median property of &quot;M&quot; ; whereas if θ &gt; 180° the same applies with the majority of points on the other side. And if θ = 180°, then &quot;A&quot; 0 and &quot;A&quot; &quot;n&quot; form a balanced pair, contradicting another assumption.

Theorem. Whenever a discrete distribution has a median &quot;M&quot;  in all directions, it coincides with its geometric median.

Proof. The sum of distances from any point &quot;P&quot;  to a set of data points in balanced pairs (&quot;A&quot;,&quot;A&quot; &#x27; ) is the sum of the lengths &quot;A&quot; – &quot;P&quot; – &quot;A&quot; &#x27;. Each individual length of this form is minimized over &quot;P&quot; when the line is straight, as happens when &quot;P&quot;  coincides with &quot;M&quot;. The sum of distances from &quot;P&quot; to any data points located at &quot;M&quot; is likewise minimized when &quot;P&quot;  and &quot;M&quot;  coincide. Thus the sum of distances from the data points to &quot;P&quot; is minimized when &quot;P&quot; coincides with &quot;M&quot;.

==Hotelling–Downs model==
A related observation was discussed by Harold Hotelling as his &#x27;principle of minimum differentiation&#x27;, also known as &#x27;Hotelling&#x27;s law&#x27;. It states that if: 

# Candidates can choose ideological positions without consequence,
# Candidates only care about winning the election (not their actual beliefs),
# All other criteria of the median voter theorem are met (i.e. voters rank candidates by ideological distance),
# The voting system satisfies the median voter criterion,

Then all politicians will converge to the median voter. As a special case, this law applies to the situation where there are exactly two candidates in the race, if it is impossible or implausible that any more candidates will join the race, because a simple majority vote between two alternatives satisfies the Condorcet criterion.

This theorem was first described by Hotelling in 1929. In practice, none of these conditions hold for modern American elections, though they may have held in Hotelling&#x27;s time (when nominees were often previously-unknown and chosen by closed party caucuses in ideologically diverse parties). Most importantly, politicians must win primary elections, which often include challengers or competitors, to be chosen as major-party nominees. As a result, politicians must compromise between appealing to the median voter in the primary and general electorates. Similar effects imply candidates do not converge to the median voter under electoral systems that do not satisfy the median voter theorem, including plurality voting, plurality-with-primaries, plurality-with-runoff, or ranked-choice runoff (RCV).

==Uses of the median voter theorem==
The theorem is valuable for the light it sheds on the optimality (and the limits to the optimality) of certain voting systems.

Valerio Dotti points out broader areas of application:
The &quot;Median Voter Theorem&quot; proved extremely popular in the Political Economy literature. The main reason is that it can be adopted to derive testable implications about the relationship between some characteristics of the voting population and the policy outcome, abstracting from other features of the political process.

He adds that...
The median voter result has been applied to an incredible variety of questions. Examples are the analysis of the relationship between income inequality and size of governmental intervention in redistributive policies (Meltzer and Richard, 1981), the study of the determinants of immigration policies (Razin and Sadka, 1999), of the extent of taxation on different types of income (Bassetto and Benhabib, 2006), and many more.

== Empirical evidence and contradictions ==
In the United States Senate, each state is allocated two seats. Levitt (1996) examined the voting patterns of pairs of senators from the same state when one belonged to the Democratic Party and the other to the Republican Party. According to the Median Voter Theorem, the voting patterns of two senators representing the same state should be identical, regardless of party affiliation. However, reality differs. Moreover, Levitt found that the similarity in their voting patterns was only slightly higher than that of randomly paired senators. This finding suggests that senators&#x27; ideological leanings have a stronger influence on their decisions than voters&#x27; preferences, contradicting the prediction of the Median Voter Theorem.

Pande (2003) studied political changes in India between 1960 and 1992 that increased political representation for marginalized groups. The data she collected showed that as a result of these changes, transfer payments to these populations increased even though the overall electorate (which had already included these groups) remained unchanged. This finding contradicts the Median Voter Theorem, as the model predicts that such a political shift should not alter the political equilibrium. 

Chattopadhyay and Duflo (2004) examined another political change in India, which mandated that women lead one-third of village councils. These councils are responsible for providing various public goods to rural communities. According to the Median Voter Theorem, this policy should not have affected the composition of public goods supplied by local governments, as a female candidate still needs to be elected by a majority vote. As long as the median voter&#x27;s preferences remain unchanged, the allocation of public goods should remain stable. However, empirical data showed that in villages where a woman was elected, the distribution of public goods shifted toward those preferred by women. Furthermore, in districts where women were elected for a second term, the allocation of public goods continued to reflect women&#x27;s preferences. It is important to note, however, that while the composition of public goods changed when a woman led the village council, this does not necessarily imply an improvement or decline in overall social welfare. 

Similar findings were reported by Miller (2008), who analyzed the impact of granting women the right to vote across the United States in 1920. Miller built on previous research indicating that women prioritize child welfare more than men and demonstrated that extending voting rights to women led to an immediate shift in federal policy. This change resulted in a significant increase in healthcare spending and a consequent reduction in child mortality rates by 8%–15%. However, unlike previous cases, Miller&#x27;s findings actually support the Median Voter Theorem. This is because granting women suffrage altered the composition of the electorate, shifting the median voter’s position toward the preferences of the new female voters. 

Lee, Moretti, and Butler (2004) investigated whether voters influence politicians&#x27; positions or merely choose from existing policy stances. They found that an exogenous shift in the voter base does not alter candidates&#x27; positions. For instance, an increase in Democratic voters in a given area does not push a Republican candidate’s stance further to the left, and vice versa. This finding suggests that the electorate selects from the positions that politicians already hold, rather than shaping those positions, contradicting the prediction of the Median Voter Theorem, which assumes candidates are ideologically neutral.  

Gerber and Lewis (2015) analyzed voting data from a series of referendums in California to estimate the preferences of the median voter. They found that elected officials are constrained by the preferences of the median voter in homogeneous regions but less so in heterogeneous ones. 

In contrast, Brunner and Ross (2010), who also studied voter data from two referendums in California, found that the decisive voter in votes concerning public expenditure was not the median voter, but rather a voter from the fourth income decile. This finding aligns with other studies suggesting that low-income voters often form coalitions with high-income voters to oppose increases in public spending. 

Referendum data from Switzerland was used by Stadelmann, Portmann, and Eichenberger (2012) to examine the degree to which legislators&#x27; votes align with the preferences of the median voter in their districts. Their research showed that the Median Voter Model explains legislative voting behavior better than an alternative random voting hypothesis, but only by a modest margin of 17.6%. Additionally, they found that support from the median voter in a senator’s district increases the likelihood of the senator supporting a given proposal by 8.4% in parliament. 

Milanovic (2000), using data from 79 countries, concluded that the greater the inequality in a country&#x27;s pre-tax income distribution, the more aggressive the redistributive policies of the winning government. This finding supports the Median Voter Theorem.

<text>Paul Karrer (21 April 1889 – 18 June 1971) was a Swiss organic chemist best known for his research on vitamins. He and British chemist Norman Haworth won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1937.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Karrer was born in Moscow, Russia to Paul Karrer and Julie Lerch, both Swiss nationals. In 1892 Karrer&#x27;s family returned to Switzerland where he was educated at Wildegg and at the Old Cantonal School Aarau where he matriculated in 1908. He studied chemistry at the University of Zurich under Alfred Werner and after gaining his Ph.D. in 1911, he spent a further year as an assistant in the Chemical Institute. He then took a post as a chemist with Paul Ehrlich at the Georg Speyer Haus, Frankfurt-am-Main. In 1919 he became Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Chemical Institute.

===Research===
Karrer&#x27;s early research concerned complex metal compounds but his most important work has concerned plant pigments, particularly the yellow carotenoids. He elucidated their chemical structure and showed that some of these substances are transformed in the body into vitamin A. His work led to the establishment of the correct constitutional formula for beta-carotene, the chief precursor of vitamin A; the first time that the structure of a vitamin or provitamin had been established. George Wald worked briefly in Karrer&#x27;s lab while studying the role of vitamin A in the retina. Later, Karrer confirmed the structure of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and extended his researches into the vitamin B2 and E. His important contributions to the chemistry of the flavins led to the identification of lactoflavin as part of the complex originally thought to be vitamin B2.

Karrer published many papers and received many honours and awards, including the Nobel Prize in 1937. His textbook &quot;Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie (Textbook of Organic Chemistry)&quot; was published in 1927, went through thirteen editions, and was published in seven languages.

===Personal life===
Karrer married Helena Froelich in 1914 and had three sons, one of whom died in infancy. He died on 18 June 1971, at the age of 82 in Zürich. His wife died in 1972.

==Legacy==
The prestigious Paul Karrer Gold Medal and lecture were established in his honour in 1959 by a group of leading companies such as CIBA AG, J.R. Geigy, F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. AG, Sandoz AG, Société des Produits Nestlé AG and Dr. A. Wander AG. It is awarded annually or biannually to an outstanding chemist who delivers a lecture at the University of Zurich.

The Paul Karrer Lecture Foundation is based at the Chemistry Institute of the University of Zurich at Rämistrasse 71, in Zürich.

<doc id="1233733" wikidata="Q1618728" url="?curid=1233733" title="Property management">
<text>Property management is the operation, control, maintenance, and oversight of real estate and physical property. This can include residential, commercial, and land real estate. Management indicates the need for real estate to be cared for and monitored, with accountability for and attention to its useful life and condition. This is much akin to the role of management in any business.

Property management is the administration of personal property, equipment, tooling, and physical capital assets acquired and used to build, repair, and maintain end-item deliverables. Property management involves the processes, systems, and workforce required to manage the life cycle of all acquired property as defined above, including acquisition, control, accountability, responsibility, maintenance, utilization, and disposition.

An owner of a single-family home, condominium, or multi-family building may engage the services of a professional property management company. The company will then advertise the rental property, handle tenant inquiries, screen applicants, select suitable candidates, draw up a lease agreement, conduct a move-in inspection, move the tenant(s) into the property and collect rental income. The company will then coordinate any maintenance issues, supply the owner(s) with financial statements and any relevant information regarding the property, etc.

== Roles ==

This profession has many facets, including managing the accounts and finances of real estate properties and participating in or initiating litigation with tenants, contractors, and insurance agencies. Litigation is sometimes considered a separate function set aside for trained attorneys. Although a person will be responsible for this in their job description, there may be an attorney working under a property manager. Special attention is given to landlord/tenant law; most commonly, evictions, non-payment, harassment, reduction of pre-arranged services, and public nuisance are legal subjects that gain the most attention from property managers. Therefore, it is a necessity that a property manager is current with applicable municipal, county, state, and Federal Fair Housing laws and practices.

== Licensing ==

=== Australia ===
Every state of Australia except South Australia requires a license to manage property. This is to ensure that a property manager is as well prepared for the job as possible. (There may be exceptions, like managing an extremely small property for a relative.) In South Australia, a property management business must be run by a registered land agent.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the laws governing property management and landlord/tenant relations are, generally speaking, a Provincial responsibility. Each Province and Territory makes its own laws on these matters. In most cases, any person or company can offer property management services, and there are licensing requirements. Other than specific laws in each Province and Territory governing these matters, they are governed by English Common Law, except in the province of Quebec, where the Civil Code is used in place of English Common Law. In some cities, the Provincial Legislation is supplemented by City by-laws.

==== British Columbia ====
The licensing of property managers is regulated by the provincial government and licensing by the BCFSA is a regulatory agency established by the provincial government. Its mandate is to protect the public interest by enforcing the licensing and licensee conduct requirements of the Real Estate Services Act. The BCFSA is responsible for licensing individuals and brokerages engaged in real estate sales, rental and strata property management. The BCFSA also enforces entry qualifications, investigates complaints against licensees and imposes disciplinary sanctions under the Act.

The BCFSA is responsible for ensuring that the interests of consumers who use the services of real estate licensees are adequately protected against wrongful actions by the licensees. A wrongful action may be deliberate or may be the consequence of inadequate exercise of reasonable judgment by a licensee in carrying out their duties and responsibilities.

The BCFSA is responsible for determining what is appropriate education in real estate matters for individuals seeking to be licensed as real estate practitioners and arranging for licensing courses and examinations as part of the qualification requirement for licensing. Under the authority of the BCFSA, licensing courses are delivered by the UBC Sauder School of Business, Real Estate Division.

==== Ontario ==== 
In Ontario, no licensing is required to operate; however, ACMO—the Association of Condo Managers of Ontario—is a self-governing body for certification and designation of its members who run buildings with more than 600 units. (RECO), the Real Estate Council of Ontario, regulates licensed realtors in Ontario. The provincial government is revising its condominium act. After public consultation, it hopes to put forth legislation during the 2015–2016 session requiring Condo Management firms and staff or condo employees and boards to be accredited.

==== Saskatchewan and Alberta ==== 
Both require property managers to hold a real estate license.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, property management is divided into the areas of home owner&#x27;s association management (WEG-Verwaltung), rental management (Mietverwaltung), and special property management (Sondereigentumsverwaltung) with different clients and tasks. Since 2018, a license in accordance with the Trade Regulation Act (§ 34 C GewO) is mandatory for property managers. This requires sufficient insurance as well as sound financial circumstances and reliability. There are no requirements regarding professional trainings or degrees. However, there is a training obligation of twenty hours within a period of three years. Receiving a license as a property manager in Germany is accompanied by membership of the relevant chamber of industry and commerce.

=== Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong, property management companies (PMCs) and property management practitioners (PMPs) are regulated under the Property Management Services Ordinance (PMSO) (Chapter 626 of the Laws of Hong Kong), which was enacted in 2016. Only some sections under the PMSO have commenced operation and they are the ones concerning the establishment of the Property Management Services Authority (PMSA) as the regulator for the industry. Apart from establishing the PMSA, the PMSO provides a legal framework for the regulatory regime, and the details of the regime, including the licensing criteria for PMCs and PMPs, are being formulated by the PMSA (public consultation underway) and will be set out in subsidiary legislation. Other sections of the PMSO will commence operation after the subsidiary legislation is passed by the Legislative Council of Hong Kong and commences operation.

Certain classes of persons are exempt from the licensing requirement. Those not exempt are required to obtain a license, and failure to do so is a criminal offence subject to a maximum penalty of a fine of HK$500,000 and imprisonment for two years. Those who are licensed are subject to disciplinary actions (including verbal warning, written reprimand, penalty up to HK$300,000, imposition of a condition on licence, suspension and revocation of licences) by the PMSA if they commit a &quot;disciplinary offence&quot; as defined under section 4 of the PMSO. The PMSA may issue codes of conduct containing practical guidance to licensees, including the matters that the PMSA considers to be relevant to determining whether a licensee has committed a disciplinary offence.

Under the PMSO, property management services (PMSs) are to be prescribed under seven specified categories as follows:
# General management services relating to a property;
# Management of the environment of a property;
# Repair, maintenance and improvement of a property;
# Finance and asset management relating to a property;
# Facility management relating to a property;
# Human resources management relating to personnel involved in the management of a property; and
# Legal services relating to the management of a property.

Only those PMCs providing PMSs falling within more than one category of PMSs are required to be licensed, and individuals who assume a managerial or supervisory role in these PMCs are also required to be licensed. In other words, PMCs providing PMSs falling within only one category of PMSs are not required to be licensed, and individuals working in the front line without assuming a managerial or supervisory role are not required to be licensed either. All types of properties (i.e. whether residential, commercial or otherwise) are covered by the PMSO, but &quot;property&quot; is given a technical meaning and refers to those which have a deed of mutual covenant (DMC) (a document containing terms that are binding on all flat owners of a multi-unit or multi-story building) since only PMSs provided to buildings with multi-ownership are intended to be regulated. In other words, PMCs and PMPs providing PMSs to properties without a DMC are not to be regulated under the PMSO.

=== India ===
In India, there is no statutory regulation of property management companies, real estate agents or developers. In 2013, a Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet but has yet to take effect. The bill seeks to set up 3 regulatory bodies in the country. The Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet in early 2016 and this is expected to bring about a sea change in the management of real estate in India.
=== Ireland ===
In the Republic of Ireland, there is no legal obligation to form a property management company. However, management companies are generally formed to manage multi-unit developments and must then follow the general rules of company law in terms of ownership and administration.

Since July 2012, it has become mandatory for all property service providers, including property management companies, to be registered and fully licensed by the Property Services Regulatory Authority of Ireland.

The National Consumer Agency (NCA) has campaigned in this area, and in September 2008 it launched a website explaining consumer rights. The NCA does not have a legislative or regulatory function in the area, unless a consumer complaint is in relation to a breach of consumer law.

=== Kenya ===
In Kenya, the Estate Agents Registration Board (EARB) is the regulatory body for estate agency practice, and it derives its mandate from the Estate Agents Act, 1984, Cap 533, which was operationalized in 1987. Under that Act, the Board is responsible for registering estate agents and ensuring that the competence and conduct of practicing estate agents are good enough to ensure the protection of the public. The Board also keeps a list of registered members on its website that is accessible to members of the public, in accordance with Section 9 of the Estate Agents Act. The Board recently drafted a proposal with a set of amendments to the Estate Agents Act.

Associations that real estate agents and property developers can join include:
* the Kenya Property Developers Association (KPDA). KPDA was established in Nairobi in 2006 as the representative body of the residential, commercial, and industrial property development sector in Kenya. It is an emerging business member organisation that works in proactive partnership with policymakers, financiers, and citizens to ensure that the property development industry grows rapidly but in an organised, efficient, economical, and ethical manner.
* the Kenya Professional Realtors Association (KPRA). KPRA is a professional organization that advances real estate professional services for real estate professionals who buy, sell, and manage real estate and related businesses. KPRA provides a variety of services to its members, including professional designation, training certification, education, and legislative representation, as well as membership in local and regional businesses affiliated with KPRA.

=== New Zealand ===
Commercial Property Management leasing agents in New Zealand are required to have a real estate agents licence and operate an audited trust bank account. Commercial leases are covered by the Property Law Act 1952.

Residential property management in New Zealand is an unlicensed and unregulated industry. Property managers in New Zealand do not require any registration or minimum knowledge or skill. The New Zealand Government reviewed whether all forms of property management need any legislation. Following completion of the review, the Associate Minister of Justice, Hon Nathan Guy, announced on 2 July 2009 that no new occupational regulation would be imposed on property managers in part due to there already being existing laws which could be used to protect consumers.

New Zealand licensed Real Estate Agents may offer Residential Property Management service with qualified Real Estate Agents as Property managers or property manager&#x27;s working under the Licensed Real estate agency. Member Agents are supposed to adhere to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand property management code of practice, which, according to the REAA, outlines industry best practices for dealing with the public. Critics state the Real Estate Agents Authority complaint committee as having less scope or jurisdiction for adverse judgement against negligent Property Management licences as they would otherwise to those in &quot;real estate agency work&quot;, Unsatisfactory property management conduct cases can receive findings of &quot;no further action&quot; as opposed to &quot;unsatisfactory conduct&quot; due to &quot;conduct unrelated to estate agency work&quot;. Best practice guidelines imply Licensed Real Estate agencies conducting property management business should collect rent through an audited trust account, which brings some certainty to the security of the Landlord and Tenants rental Monies, though REAA cases, implies that this is not always so.

The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 sets out the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants, including the requirement to have a written tenancy agreement and the need to lodge tenancy bonds (if one is required) with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The Tenancy Tribunal and its adjudicators/mediators hear and make judgement on disputes (between landlord and tenants) in relation to any breaches of The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 and The Unit Titles Act 2010.

On July 1, 2019, the Healthy Homes Standards became law. The healthy homes standards introduce specific and minimum standards for heating, insulation, ventilation, moisture ingress and drainage, and draft stopping in rental properties. All private rentals must comply within 90 days of any new or renewed tenancy after 1 July 2021, with all private rentals complying by 1 July 2024

The Unit Titles Act 2010 sets out the law for the ownership and management of unit title developments, where multiple owners each hold a unit title. The Act covers the set-up of such developments, body corporate governance, the rights and obligations of the body corporate and unit owners, disclosure between buyers and sellers, dispute resolution, etc. The Unit Titles Regulations 2011 provide operational guidelines. The body corporate is responsible for financial and administrative functions relating to the common property and the development. All unit owners are members of the body corporate. A body corporate can delegate some of its powers and duties to a body corporate committee and a professional body corporate manager may be contracted to provide services.
=== Panama ===
No license is required to manage properties in Panama, as long as the company is focused on managing properties. Nevertheless, a real estate company that plans to buy and sell properties requires a license.

=== Romania ===
No specific regulatory or licensing body exists at this time (November 2012). However, under financial business law, any business offering Property Management as a chargeable, fee-earning act of commerce may only do so if such services are listed in their Company Acts of Constitutions, i.e., legally pre-declared list of business activities. Under Romanian law, no business can derive income from any such service that is not declared in this way and should be demonstrable upon request by the client of legal entities.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, there is no statutory regulation concerning property management companies. Companies that manage rented residential property are often members of the Association of Residential Letting Agents. Companies or individual landlords who accept tenancy deposits for &quot;assured shorthold tenancies&quot; (the usual form of residential tenancy) are required by statute to be members of a Tenancy Deposit Scheme.

=== United States ===
Most states, such as New York and Colorado, require property management companies to be licensed real estate brokers if they are collecting rent, listing properties for rent, or helping negotiate leases and doing inspections as a third-party. A property manager may be a licensed real estate salesperson but generally they must be working under a licensed real estate broker. Most states have a public license check system online for anyone holding a real estate salesperson or real estate broker&#x27;s license. A few states, such as Idaho, Maine, and Vermont, do not require property managers to have real estate licenses. Other states, such as Montana, Oregon, and South Carolina, allow property managers to work under a property management license rather than a broker&#x27;s license. Some states, like Pennsylvania, allow property managers to work without a real estate license if they do not negotiate leases, hold tenants&#x27; money, or enter into leases on the property owner&#x27;s behalf.

Owners who manage their own property are not required to have a real estate license in many states; however, they must at least have a business license to rent out their own home. Owners who do not live near the rental property may be required, by local government, to hire the services of a property management company. Some states with high tourism numbers, such as Hawaii, have strict property management rules.

In California, third-party apartment property managers must be licensed with the California Bureau of Real Estate as a real estate broker. A broker&#x27;s license is required for any person or company that, for compensation, leases or rents or offers to lease or rent, or places for rent, or solicits listing of places for rent, or solicits for prospective tenants, or negotiates the sale, purchase, or exchange of leases on real property, or on a business opportunity, or collects rents from real property, or improvements thereon, or from business opportunities. California Code of Regulations, Title 25, Section 42, requires property owners of apartment buildings with 16 or more units to have on-site resident managers living on their properties. There is no such requirement for apartment buildings with less than 16 units.

The designation Real Estate Broker is often confused by those unfamiliar with terms of the industry such as Realtor, real estate agent, or real estate salesperson, and definitions vary from US state to state.

== Property management software ==

Property management software continues to grow in popularity and importance. As it decreases in price, smaller companies and amateur property managers can function using some of the same best practices and efficiency as larger companies. Online asset management software (OPMS, or online property management software) has been a significant cause of the price declines. In addition to the core property management software options, a quickly growing number of closely related software products are being introduced to the industry.

A property management system, also known as a PMS, is a comprehensive software application used to cover objectives like coordinating the operational functions of the front office, bookings, communication with guests, planning, reporting, etc. This kind of software is used to run large-scale hotels and vacation properties.

== Business models ==

=== Percentage of rent ===
This is the most common model and is used by property management companies in the residential space that manage multi-home units and single-family homes. The property owner in this case signs a property management agreement with the company, giving the latter the right to let it out to new tenants and collect rent. The owners don&#x27;t usually even know who the tenants are. The property management company usually keeps 10-15% of the rent amount and shares the rest with the property owner.

=== Fixed fee ===
This is the most common revenue model used by companies when monitoring empty homes or empty land sites. The work here involves monitoring the property and ensuring that it is safe and secure, and reporting back to the owner. As there is no income from these properties, a fixed monthly fee is usually charged to the owner.

=== Guaranteed rent ===
This model is also used in the residential space, but mostly for small units in high-demand locations. Here, the company signs a rental agreement with the owner and pays them a fixed rent. As per the agreement, the company is given the right to sublet the property for a higher rent. The company&#x27;s income is the difference between the two rents. As is evident, in this case, the company minimizes the rent paid to the owner, which is usually lower than market rates.

=== Revenue share ===
This model applies to the service apartment space and other commercial establishments, such as retail or business centers that generate revenue. In this case, the property manager signs an agreement with the property owner, with the right to convert the property into a revenue-generating business such as a business center, service apartment, etc. Instead of paying rent to the owner, the management company shares a percentage of revenue. There are also hybrid structures here, where a combination of a fixed rent and a share of revenue is shared with the property owner.

<doc id="1233754" wikidata="Q200261" url="?curid=1233754" title="Tom Welling">
<text>Thomas Joseph Welling (born April 26, 1977) is an American actor, director, producer, podcaster, and model. He is best known for his role as Clark Kent in The WB (now The CW) superhero drama &quot;Smallville&quot; (2001–2011). He also co-starred in the third season of the Fox fantasy comedy-drama &quot;Lucifer&quot; as Lt. Marcus Pierce/Cain (2017–2018).

A high school athlete, Welling initially worked in construction and, in 1998, he began modelling men&#x27;s clothing for several popular brands. In 2000, he transitioned to television. He has been nominated and received several awards for his role as Clark Kent. In 2001, he had a recurring role as Rob &quot;Karate Rob&quot; Meltzer in the second season of the CBS legal drama &quot;Judging Amy&quot;. His films include &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (2003), &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot; (2005), &quot;The Fog&quot; (2005), &quot;Draft Day&quot; (2014), and &quot;The Choice&quot; (2016). In 2022, he starred as Samuel Campbell in the dark fantasy series &quot;The Winchesters&quot;. He has also been involved behind the camera as an executive producer and a director.

== Early life ==
Welling was born in Putnam Valley, New York. His family moved frequently, making stops in Wisconsin, Delaware, and Michigan. Welling is of German, Polish, Hungarian, Slovak, Austrian and British descent. Welling attended Okemos High School in Okemos, Michigan, where he started acting in plays, but then switched to sports. Welling played baseball and soccer, but his favorite sport is basketball. Welling is one of four children, with two older sisters, Rebecca and Jamie, and a younger brother, Mark Welling, who is also an actor.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Originally a construction worker, Welling was discovered in 1998 at a party in Nantucket by casting director Jennifer Starr who was there finding fresh faces for a Tommy Hilfiger campaign and suggested he try modeling. Welling modeled for Louisa Modeling Agency until 2000, when he relocated to Los Angeles. There he modeled for Tommy Hilfiger, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, and Calvin Klein while pursuing an acting career. In 2000, Welling appeared in Angela Via&#x27;s music video &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; where he played Vía&#x27;s love interest. Welling has said that he did not like modeling and that he was not good at it because it was all on the outside or from an external point of view. He pursued acting because he wanted to express a range of emotions, but Welling still models occasionally and appeared in the May 2008 issue of &quot;Vogue&quot;, the so-called &quot;Superhero Issue&quot;. In his first major acting role, Welling played karate teacher Rob &quot;Karate Rob&quot; Meltzer, a younger love interest of Amy Gray (Amy Brenneman) in the second season of the CBS legal drama &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, which aired in 2001. Welling was originally signed for three episodes, but after receiving good feedback, the producers kept him for three more. Welling also had a small role in the pilot episode of the UPN science fiction sitcom &quot;Special Unit 2&quot;, and he appeared in the pilot episode of the short-lived Fox sitcom &quot;Undeclared&quot;.

=== &quot;Smallville&quot; ===

Welling was cast in the WB superhero drama &quot;Smallville&quot; after a nationwide search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In an interview with a teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: &quot;I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, &#x27;Can you hold on a second?&#x27; Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, &#x27;Tom, you got it!&#x27;&quot; The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest-rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told &quot;TV Guide&quot; that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a &quot;Superman&quot; fan before being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continued to not read &quot;Superman&quot; comics: &quot;I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We&#x27;re doing something different at a time before all that, I don&#x27;t want that to affect what I&#x27;m doing, even subconsciously.&quot; He did get the chance to meet two previous &quot;Superman&quot; actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled &quot;Rosetta&quot;, and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled &quot;Cure&quot;.

Welling was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Breakthrough Stars of 2001&quot;, and also won the Teen Choice Award as &quot;Choice Breakout Star (Male)&quot; in 2002 for his role as Clark Kent. Following the third season, Welling was interviewed by &quot;Smallville Magazine&quot; and said that if he could play one character on the show that was not Clark Kent, it would be Lex Luthor; &quot;Lex Luthor! I wouldn&#x27;t mind having my head shaved—as an actor, [it is the ultimate,] getting to play the complete opposite of your character.&quot;

In 2003, Welling said he met with director Brett Ratner about potentially playing Clark Kent/Superman in the superhero film &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006), but scheduling conflicted with &quot;Smallville&quot;. Comic book artist Alex Ross even did two sketches of Welling as the &quot;Man of Steel&quot; to see what the actor would look like in the famous costume. In August 2009, Welling won another Teen Choice Award as &quot;Choice TV Actor (Action Adventure)&quot; for &quot;Smallville&quot;.

In 2019, Welling reprised his role as Clark Kent in the &quot;Batwoman&quot; episode of the CW Arrowverse crossover event &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, along with his &quot;Smallville&quot; co-star Erica Durance as Lois Lane. Welling&#x27;s reprisal concluded his incarnation&#x27;s story where it showed Clark gave up his powers, retired as an average farmer, and has at least two daughters with Lois.

On July 13, 2022, Welling and fellow &quot;Smallville&quot; actor Michael Rosenbaum launched the podcast &quot;Talkville,&quot; where the two co-stars comment on every episode of &quot;Smallville&quot;.

=== &quot;Lucifer&quot; ===
In 2017, Welling made his much-awaited return to television when he was cast to co-star in the third season of the Fox fantasy comedy-drama &quot;Lucifer&quot;. He played Marcus Pierce, a police lieutenant at the precinct and the main antagonist of the season who is the immortal Cain.

When asked why he suddenly decided to return to television, he told Entertainment weekly: &#x27;Shortly after I got a call from a very dear friend of mine, Greg Beeman, who was our showrunner on Smallville for many years and had directed episodes of Lucifer, and he goes, “I hear that your name’s in the mix to be on Lucifer. I know you, I’ve worked on the show, you’re going to love it, don’t overthink it.” So then I binge-watched about six episodes of the show, because I was familiar with the show, but they were like, “Take a look at these six that we recommend for you to watch, these are our favorites,” and I watched them all, and Wednesday morning the conversation was, “I don’t want to do 10 episodes,” and they said, “Well, you have to do 10, it’s 10 or nothing.” I said, “I want to do more, I want to do 15,” and so we signed on for 15 episodes, because I like it that much, and having met the cast and the crew they’re so much fun. They have a good time, they get their work done, they’re professional, but they’re enjoying themselves. I like the show, the show’s fun. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, but they solve bit crimes and their issues and stuff like that.&#x27;

=== Film ===
In December 2003, Welling made his feature film debut as Charlie Baker, the oldest son and second-oldest in the Baker family which had 12 children, in the family comedy &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; with Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, which is a remake of the 1950 movie starring Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy, based on the 1948 book about the family of Frank and Lillian Gilbreth and written by two of their children. Welling talked about why he was interested in the project in an interview with Paul Fischer: &quot;The top three reasons I decided to do this film were, one, Steve Martin, two, Steve Martin and three, Steve Martin. That was the number one draw for me. Then, after reading the script, I really liked this character, Charlie. I liked what he went through, what he had to go through, and I felt I understood where he was coming from. And I just wanted to be a part of it.&quot; Welling had always been a fan of Martin&#x27;s and said that he &quot;absolutely loved&quot; working with him.

In 2005, Welling co-starred in the horror film &quot;The Fog&quot;, a remake of John Carpenter&#x27;s 1980 film of the same name, as Nick Castle (a character originally played by Tom Atkins). At the same time &quot;The Fog&quot; was in production, Welling was still working on the last few episodes of the fourth season of &quot;Smallville&quot;. The same year, he reprised his role as Charlie Baker in &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen 2&quot;.

In 2013, Welling was among the all-star cast of the historical drama &quot;Parkland&quot;, based on the book &quot;Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy&quot; by author Vincent Bugliosi. The story centers on the chaotic events that occurred at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas on the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. In 2014, Welling co-starred in Ivan Reitman&#x27;s sports drama &quot;Draft Day&quot;. He played a veteran quarterback whose career is at a crossroads.

=== Production ===
For &quot;Smallville&quot;″s ninth season, Welling served as a co-executive producer. He returned as Clark Kent for the show&#x27;s tenth and final season in Fall 2010 and became a full executive producer, as credited in a May 20, 2010 press release by the CW.

Welling served as an executive producer of the CW comedy-drama &quot;Hellcats&quot; based on journalist Kate Torgovnick&#x27;s book &quot;Cheer: Inside the Secret World of College Cheerleaders&quot;. The series first aired on The CW beginning in the fall of 2010, and was canceled on May 17, 2011. According to Welling, the reason of cancellation was because of the change of CW president of entertainment from Dawn Ostroff to Mark Pedowitz.

=== Directing ===
Welling made his directorial debut in 2006 with the &quot;Smallville&quot; episode &quot;Fragile&quot; (5.18). He also directed &quot;Hydro&quot; (6.10); the show&#x27;s 150th episode, &quot;Apocalypse&quot; (7.18); &quot;Injustice&quot; (8.21); the second part (&quot;Legends&quot;) of the two-hour episode &quot;Absolute Justice&quot; (9.11); and two episodes of &quot;Smallville&quot;&#x27;s final season, &quot;Patriot&quot; (10.09) and &quot;Booster&quot; (10.18).

== Personal life ==
On July 5, 2002, Welling married model Jamie White on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard with Welling&#x27;s friends and then-&quot;Smallville&quot; co-stars Kristin Kreuk and Michael Rosenbaum in attendance. Welling and White resided in Vancouver, British Columbia, but returned to Los Angeles in March 2011. On October 17, 2013, White filed for divorce from Welling. The divorce was finalized in November 2015.

In 2014, Welling began dating equestrian and Saddle Club founder Jessica Rose Lee. In April 2018, they announced their engagement. The couple has two sons, born in January 2019 and June 2021. Welling and Lee married on November 30, 2019, at Sunstone Vineyards &amp; Winery in Santa Ynez, California.

Welling plays golf in his spare time. Welling has said in &quot;YM&quot; that he dislikes interviews. He said &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be a celebrity for the sake of being a celebrity. I want to work and then go home and live in private.&quot; Welling has also said he disliked modeling because it was not fulfilling and was not an expressive job.

On January 26, 2025, Welling was arrested in Yreka, California for driving under the influence.

<doc id="1233758" wikidata="Q7349078" url="?curid=1233758" title="Robert Q. Lewis">
<text>Robert Q. Lewis (born Robert Goldberg; April 25, 1921 – December 11, 1991) was an American radio and television entertainer, comedian, game show host and actor. Although born with the Goldberg name, he grew up as Lewis, his father&#x27;s professional name.

Lewis is perhaps best known for his game show participation, having been the first host of &quot;The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot;, and regularly appearing on other Goodson-Todman panel shows. He also hosted and appeared on a multitude of TV shows from the 1940s through the 1970s.

His most distinguishing feature was his horn-rimmed glasses, to the point that the title card for his second &quot;Robert Q. Lewis Show&quot; used a drawing of such glasses as a logo. They were also mentioned in the title of his lecture. As a frequent guest panelist on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, Lewis&#x27;s blindfold featured a sketched pair of glasses.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lewis&#x27;s parents were Jewish immigrants from Imperial Russia. His father, known professionally as Samuel I. Lewis, was a New York attorney.

&quot;I was born on New York&#x27;s west side and came from a simple and humble home, and went to P.S. 87 over on Amsterdam Avenue, where one gets a pretty good idea of true democracy,&quot; Lewis remarked in 1954. &quot;After school all of us kids went to each other&#x27;s houses and thought nothing of race, color, religion, or anything else. There just wasn&#x27;t any difference. I didn&#x27;t know there was a Jewish problem until I had graduated from high school and was in college,&quot; where fraternities discriminated against him. 

===Radio===
In 1931, a 10-year-old Lewis made his debut on the local radio show &quot;Dr. Posner&#x27;s Kiddie Hour.&quot; This started his fascination with radio. That same year he set up a microphone and record player at home and became the family&#x27;s disc jockey.

He enrolled in the University of Michigan in 1938, where he was a member of Phi Sigma Delta (later merged into Zeta Beta Tau), and graduated in 1941. He then became a staff announcer for WTRY, a radio station in Troy, New York—and on December 7, 1941, he was the only announcer in the building when news of the Pearl Harbor attack reached the station. In 1942, still at WTRY, he added the middle initial &quot;Q&quot; to his name accidentally while on the air. He was thinking of radio comedian F. Chase Taylor&#x27;s character Colonel Lemuel Q. Stoopnagle, and &quot;when I signed off, I declared &#x27;This is Robert Q. Lewis.&#x27; I don&#x27;t know why but that got lots of good reaction.&quot; He decided to retain the initial: &quot;The luckiest ad lib in the world! It helped people remember me. Everyone wanted to know what the Q stood for.&quot; His own answer varied, &quot;his favorite being &quot;Quackpot&quot;.&quot;

Lewis was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942. He was sent to the Air Force&#x27;s Radio Operating and Mechanic School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to build radio sets. &quot;I always liked radio,&quot; Lewis recalled, &quot;but who wants to put them together?&quot; He joined the Special Services unit to put on camp shows, but after two bouts with pneumonia he was discharged from the service.

He then worked at three New York radio stations before joining CBS Radio. In 1947 staff announcer and disc jockey Robert Q. Lewis filled in for radio superstar Arthur Godfrey on Godfrey&#x27;s popular morning show on the national network. Lewis did so well that Godfrey insisted that Lewis must always be the alternate host, a tremendous break for Lewis and a stepping stone for bigger things. Lewis got his own late-afternoon network show, but continued to substitute for Godfrey until at least 1959.

Among those who served as writers on Lewis&#x27;s radio programs were playwright Neil Simon, author and dramatist Paddy Chayefsky, and radio comedy writer Goodman Ace. Simon, Chayefsky, and Ace headed a CBS team of comedy writers that acted largely as &quot;script doctors&quot; for existing shows in need of fixing. Ace was frustrated over a CBS revamp of the show he assembled for Lewis, &quot;The Little Show:&quot; &quot;I give them a good, tight, 15-minute comedy show,&quot; Ace told &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;and what do they do? Expand it to half an hour and throw in an orchestra and an audience. Who the hell said a comedy show had to be half an hour, Marconi? Ida Cantor?&quot;

In 1949, Lewis had a 30-minute sustaining (unsponsored) program broadcast on CBS Monday - Friday at 4:30 p.m. ET featuring the Howard Smith Orchestra. The Ames Brothers and Eugenie Baird were regular performers. In addition to Lewis&#x27;s comedy, the show included audience participation, as several people in the studio answered a question posed by Lewis. A review in the trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; called Lewis &quot;a bright spot on the afternoon spectrum.&quot; Future talk-show host and producer Merv Griffin often sang on Lewis&#x27;s network radio show; Griffin later married Lewis&#x27;s secretary, Julann Wright.

Besides Lewis&#x27;s many guest appearances on variety programs and game shows in the early years of TV, his favorite medium as host continued with radio, first for CBS and later as a disc jockey in Los Angeles. One of his radio series, &quot;Robert Q.&#x27;s Waxworks,&quot; was devoted to playing old records, setting a pattern that later radio personalities such as Dr. Demento would follow. Lewis&#x27;s interview-based program was heard locally on KFI, Los Angeles, in 1972.

===Television===
Lewis was an early arrival on network TV, presiding over more than one series at a time. &quot;The Robert Q. Lewis Show&quot; had a six-month run on CBS&#x27;s Sunday night lineup from July 16, 1950 to January 7, 1951. He hosted CBS&#x27;s talent-search variety show, &quot;The Show Goes On&quot; from January 19, 1950, to February 16, 1952. He also had two CBS daytime variety shows. The first, &quot;Robert Q&#x27;s Matinee,&quot; was a 45-minute daily show which ran from October 16, 1950 to January 19, 1951. 

The second, more successful &quot;The Robert Q. Lewis Show&quot; ran on CBS on weekday afternoons from January 11, 1954 to May 25, 1956. Similar to the concurrent Arthur Godfrey show, the Lewis program featured a company of regulars: singers Earl Wrightson, Lois Hunt, Jaye P. Morgan, and Jan Arden; dancer Don Liberto; announcer Lee Vines, and bandleader Ray Bloch. The key to the program&#x27;s success was its informality, as columnist Ed Meyerson observed: &quot;The woman of the house doesn&#x27;t want actors in her living room, she wants company—and when it comes to seeing them every afternoon, there&#x27;s to be no standing on ceremony. Every member of the cast is seen as a person as well as a performer.&quot; 

In addition to his daytime-TV duties, Lewis became a fixture on TV quiz shows in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1952, he settled into his most enduring game-show role as host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot;. The show featured a celebrity panel trying to guess the identities of contestants who had famous names: Napoleon Bonaparte, Marilyn Monroe, Virginia Beach, etc. On a few occasions, contestants appeared on the show bearing the name Robert Q. Lewis. 

At the end of the August 31, 1954 broadcast, Lewis frankly told his viewers that the show would not be back the following week, and he didn&#x27;t know if it would be returning. As it developed, the show was canceled as TV&#x27;s fall season began, and the longtime sponsor (Swanson canned and frozen poultry) followed Lewis to CBS and sponsored his variety show. ABC brought &quot;The Name&#x27;s the Same&quot; back on November 29, 1954 with new host Dennis James, new sponsor Ralston-Purina, and new theme music (&quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;), in reference to the sponsor&#x27;s location).

Lewis remained a busy performer, appearing as a nightclub headliner in the United States and Canada, Beginning in 1958, Lewis was forced to change careers. &quot;My kind of show -- the informal, anything-goes daytime thing -- is in disrepute since filmed syndication took over [i.e., local stations filling afternoon hours with their own libraries of movies and TV episodes] and it&#x27;s affected all of us -- [Arthur] Godfrey, [Garry] Moore.&quot; He became less known as an entertainer and more familiar as a personality on TV game shows. He hosted the short-lived original version of &quot;Make Me Laugh&quot;. In 1962, he substituted for and ultimately replaced Merv Griffin as host of &quot;Play Your Hunch.&quot; In 1964, he hosted the short-lived game show &quot;Get the Message&quot; on ABC.

He was a frequent participant on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, making 40 appearances in all. He first appeared as a panelist in 1951, about a year into the show&#x27;s run. His most regular run was alternating weeks with comedian Fred Allen following the departure of regular panelist Steve Allen, beginning in 1954 through early 1955; Fred Allen ultimately took the spot on a regular basis for approximately a year until his death. Lewis made regular guest appearances up to the show&#x27;s final year in 1967. He also made one appearance as the show&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Guest&quot; in 1955. He was a guest panelist/player on a number of Goodson-Todman shows.

Lewis was often recruited to fill in for performers who were ill or otherwise unable to perform. Arthur Godfrey had first call on his services. Jackie Gleason invited &quot;Robert Q. Lewis and His Gang&quot; to take over his &quot;American Scene Magazine&quot; time slot while he was away. In April 1962 Lewis took over the game show &quot;Number Please&quot; for two weeks. In January 1965 he was the substitute host of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; for four weeks, while moderator Bud Collyer was convalescing from a heart attack. These emergency replacements became part of Lewis&#x27;s comic monologue; he&#x27;d tell how he called his mother asking her to watch him on CBS, only to hear her say, &quot;Oh? Who&#x27;s sick?&quot;

===Records===
Lewis was always an enthusiast of vintage music. He frequently revived old Tin Pan Alley tunes on his radio and TV shows, and in his very popular nightclub act. From the 1940s he sang for Columbia Records, MGM Records, and Coral Records. He scored his biggest hit in 1951 with the dialect novelty song, &quot;Where&#x27;s-a Your House?&quot;, an answer record to the Rosemary Clooney hit &quot;Come On-a My House&quot;. In 1967, he recorded &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Vaudeville&quot; for Atco—this collection of circa-1930 songs has Lewis cleverly imitating different singing styles of the day.

===Movies and TV===
Lewis&#x27;s fondness for show-business nostalgia was well known within the industry, and in 1949 he was hired to narrate the &quot;lighter side&quot; segment of the feature-length &quot;March of Time&quot; documentary film &quot;The Golden Twenties&quot;. He was too busy to pursue a movie career at the time because of his hectic radio, television, and nightclub schedule. He did confess to one screen ambition -- starring in remakes of old Harold Lloyd comedies like &quot;The Milky Way&quot; and &quot;The Freshman&quot; -- but he was unable to obtain remake rights, which were still controlled by Lloyd.

Later in his career, Lewis acted in a few movies, notably &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; (1957), &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot; (1964), &quot;Ski Party&quot; (1965), &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; (1967), &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot; (1972), and the TV movie &quot;The Law&quot; (1974), in which he played a dinner speaker at a lawyers&#x27; convention. He also appeared on a number of television series, including &quot;Room for One More&quot;; &quot;The Hathaways&quot;; &quot;Branded&quot;; &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;; &quot;Ichabod and Me&quot;; &quot;Bewitched&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; and &quot;Emergency!&quot;, among others.

===Rise and fall===
Lewis was at once the envy of his show-business peers and a victim of his own success. He made himself available to so many programs when television was new that he dominated the airwaves. A 1954 report syndicated by United Press International commented on his busy schedule that included recording sessions, nightclub dates, and telethons: &quot;Now with 12 radio and TV shows a week, Lewis will no longer have time to be Godfrey&#x27;s stand-in.&quot; (He found the time, and remained with Godfrey for five more years.)

Lewis was so well established that networks and sponsors often chose him over other performers, who resented his omnipresence. Comedian Orson Bean told entertainment historian Kliph Nesteroff an &quot;inside show biz&quot; joke that made the rounds: &quot;There&#x27;s the story about the guy who falls off a building, hits an awning as he&#x27;s coming down, slides off the awning as a hay truck is driving by, and lands right in the hay. Someone says, &#x27;God, you have got to be the luckiest guy in the world!&#x27; The guy says &#x27;No. Robert Q. Lewis.&#x27;&quot;

Lewis had become a media standard by the end of the 1950s, which led network executives to conclude that he&#x27;d had too much exposure. They now hired him far less often, forcing him to take whatever jobs came his way. &quot;I don&#x27;t think audiences had gotten tired of seeing me around, but I do think I was overexposed to advertising agencies and network executives. Anyway, nobody would hire me.&quot; Lewis wryly commented on his underemployment in a press release for one of his records: &quot;With this recording Robert Q. Lewis adds a glorious new chapter to his long career as disc jockey, comedian, panel moderator, replacement, actor, and bartender. At this particular moment, he is available for bookings of any kind. Contact Martin Baum, GAC, Hollywood. Thanks very much.&quot;

===Theater===
Beginning in 1961, when his television work dried up temporarily, Lewis became a familiar face on the live-theater circuit. &quot;Most people think that stock companies today consist of summer stock in summer theaters. That&#x27;s nonsense. There&#x27;s fall stock, winter stock, and spring stock, all around the country. And if you&#x27;ve had television exposure, you can make good money playing in every contemporary American comedy written in the last 20 years and playing in them all over the country.&quot; Lewis starred in road-company versions of Broadway hits, including &quot;The Tunnel of Love&quot;, &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;, &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. He continued to make sporadic acting appearances until a few years before his death.

Lewis commented on his work as a character actor in 1966: &quot;These glasses have always been my trademark. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so much fun to work without them. Look, I become an entirely different person -- even to me -- without my glasses. With them on, I just feel like a sweet, average guy, but when I take them off I&#x27;m no longer Robert Q. Lewis. I become, well, sort of a Jewish Victor Jory.&quot;

===Personal life===
Robert Q. Lewis was a lifelong collector of paintings and sculptures, ranging from fine artworks to circus posters. He began his collection as a child, when an uncle took him along on a visit to Pablo Picasso in Paris. Picasso liked the boy and inscribed a drawing personally to Lewis. A columnist visiting his New York apartment noted that &quot;a Picasso print on one wall and a Gauguin on another hold their own against three bathing beauties of the early 1900s on a third wall. These last are framed postcards from Bob&#x27;s collection of souvenir postcards. He&#x27;s a demon collector.&quot;
Lewis never married, although he did have three serious relationships. His first girlfriend was a childhood sweetheart named Eileen, and they stayed together through high school. Just before he entered college he broached the subject of marriage, only to meet with disapproval from her father. Robert Q. told the story to a magazine columnist, who wrote, &quot;Were Robert a shoe salesman, a bookkeeper, or even, at least by inference, a race track tout, Papa would have no objections. But his daughter marry a radio actor? To Robert&#x27;s dismay, Eileen backed Papa up. She wanted, she said, a &#x27;normal&#x27; life.&quot;

Lewis was engaged twice, &quot;once to a very nice girl. I was detained at a business conference and showed up late for a bridge game. She decided she didn&#x27;t want to have her life disrupted.&quot; The report concluded, &quot;His other fiancée was in show business. Gallantly, Bob doesn&#x27;t explain what broke that one up, but he takes the blame.&quot; According to a 1954 profile, &quot;he is one of the most sought-after bachelors of all time, averaging some 150 proposals a week.&quot;

Lewis was a heavy smoker and died of emphysema in Century City Hospital on December 11, 1991. He had no survivors.

A collection of Lewis&#x27;s personal papers, notes, and scripts, covering roughly the years 1940–1960, is located at Thousand Oaks Library in Thousand Oaks, California.

<text>A data entry clerk, also known as data preparation and control operator, data registration and control operator, and data preparation and registration operator, is a member of staff employed to enter or update data into a computer system. Data is often entered into a computer from paper documents using a keyboard. The keyboards used can often have special keys and multiple colors to help in the task and speed up the work. Proper ergonomics at the workstation is a common topic considered.

The data entry clerk may also use a mouse, and a manually-fed scanner may be involved.

Speed and accuracy, not necessarily in that order, are the key measures of the job.

==History==

The invention of punched card data processing in the 1890s created a demand for many workers, typically women, to run keypunch machines. To ensure accuracy, data was often entered twice; the second time a different keyboarding device, known as a verifier (such as the IBM 056) was used.

In the 1970s, punched card data entry was gradually replaced by the use of video display terminals.

==Examples==
For a mailing company, data entry clerks might be required to type in reference numbers for items of mail which had failed to reach their destination, so that the relevant addresses could be deleted from the database used to send the mail out. If the company was compiling a database from addresses handwritten on a questionnaire, the person typing those into the database would be a data entry clerk. In a cash office, a data entry clerk might be required to type expenses into a database using numerical codes.

==Optical character/mark recognition==
With to the advance of technology, many data entry clerks no longer work with hand-written documents. Instead, the documents are first scanned by a combined OCR/OMR system (optical character recognition and optical mark recognition,) which attempts to read the documents and process the data electronically. The accuracy of OCR varies widely based upon the quality of the original document as well as the scanned image; hence the ongoing need for data entry clerks. Although OCR technology is continually being developed, many tasks still require a data entry clerk to review the results afterward to check the accuracy of the data and to manually key in any missed or incorrect information.

An example of this system would be one commonly used to document health insurance claims, such as for Medicaid in the United States. In many systems, the hand-written forms are first scanned into digital images (JPEG, PNG, bitmap, etc.). These files are then processed by the optical character recognition system, where many fields are completed by the computerized optical scanner. When the OCR software has low confidence in a data field, it is flagged for review – not the entire record but just the single field. The data entry clerk then manually reviews the data already entered by OCR, corrects it if needed, and fills in any missing data by simultaneously viewing the image on-screen.

The accuracy of personal records, as well as billing or financial information, is usually very important to the general public as well as the healthcare provider. Sensitive or vital information such as this is often checked many times, by both clerk and machine, before being accepted.

==Job requirements, security, and pay==
Accuracy is usually more important than speed, because detection and correction of errors can be very time-consuming. Staying focused and speed are also required.

The job is usually low-skilled, so veteran staff are often employed on a temporary basis after a large survey or census has been completed. However, most companies handling large amounts of data on a regular basis will spread the contracts and workload across the year and will hire part-time.

The role of data entry clerks working with physical hand-written documents is on the decline in the developed world, because employees within a company frequently enter their own data, as it is collected now, instead of having a different employee do this task. An example of this is an operator working in a call center or a cashier in a shop. Cost is another reason for the decline. Data entry is labor-intensive for large batches and therefore expensive, so large companies will sometimes outsource the work, either locally or to third-world countries where there is no shortage of cheaper unskilled labor.

, the median pay was between $19,396 and $34,990 in the United States.

, &quot;The New York Times&quot; was still carrying ads for the job title &quot;Data Entry Clerk&quot;.

==Education and training==
For the job as a data entry clerk, competent math and English skills may be necessary. The worker will need to be very familiar with office software such as word processors, databases, and spreadsheets. One must have quickness, focus, and customer service skills.

Education higher than a high school diploma is often not required, but some companies require a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Companies also hope the worker will have one year of experience in a related field.

<text>Warble fly is a name given to the genus Hypoderma: large flies which are parasitic on cattle and deer. Other names include &quot;heel flies&quot;, &quot;bomb flies&quot; and &quot;gadflies&quot;, while their larvae are often called &quot;cattle grubs&quot; or &quot;wolves.&quot; Common species of warble fly include &quot;Hypoderma bovis&quot; (the ox warble fly) and &quot;Hypoderma lineatum&quot; (the [[cattle]] warble fly) and &quot;Hypoderma tarandi&quot; (the [[reindeer]] warble fly). Larvae of &quot;Hypoderma&quot; species also have been reported in horses, sheep, goats and humans. They have also been found on smaller mammals such as dogs, cats, squirrels, voles and rabbits.

Adult warble flies are large, hairy and bumblebee-like and brown, orange or yellow in color. The adults have vestigial mouthparts, so they cannot feed during their short lifespans, which can be as little as five days.

They are found on all continents of the Northern Hemisphere, mainly between 25° and 60° latitude.

==Infestations==
The fly lays eggs on the forelegs of large animals. The eggs hatch within a week and penetrate the skin, where they migrate throughout the connective tissues (&quot;H. bovis&quot;) or to the esophagus (&quot;H. lineatum&quot;). After a few months, the larvae travel back to the skin surface and cause swellings called &quot;warbles&quot;. They remain under the skin, and when destroyed by pressure, the larvae can cause large purulent swellings, or anaphylaxis. Upon emergence, the fly leaves holes in the skin. Large numbers of such punctures can render cattle hides valueless.

The migrating larvae can cause damage to meat, as the tunnels they make in the muscle fill with a substance known as &quot;butcher&#x27;s jelly&quot;. Infestations also hinder weight gain and growth in the animals. Milk yields may also decline. Most infections in adult cows are minor, due to immunity developed over time.

===Humans===
In humans, the disease intracerebral myiasis is a rare infestation of the brain by the larva of &quot;H. bovis&quot;. It penetrates the brain by an unknown mode and causes symptoms such as convulsions and intracerebral hematoma. The first case of human warble fly infection in Britain (to a four-year-old boy on a farm near South Brent, Devon) was reported in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in June 1924 by Dr Frederick William Style Other cases appear in medical literature. Myiasis of the human eye can be caused by &quot;H. tarandi&quot;, a parasite of reindeer. It is known to cause uveitis, glaucoma and retinal detachment. &quot;H. lineatum&quot; and &quot;H. sinense&quot; may also infest humans.

==Treatment and prevention==
Warble flies have been eradicated in many countries, beginning with Denmark and Western Germany, in the 1960s. It was eradicated in the United Kingdom in 1990. It is a notifiable disease. It may have been eradicated from Belgium.

From the 1980s, the preventive treatment is easier, by subcutaneous use of ivermectin, but the warble fly remains present in North Africa.

<doc id="1233769" wikidata="Q1054053" url="?curid=1233769" title="Jungle Commando">
<text>The Jungle Commando (formally known as the Suriname National Liberation [[Army]]) was a guerrilla commando group in Suriname. It was founded by Ronnie Brunswijk in 1986 to ensure equal rights for Suriname&#x27;s minority Maroon population. The group was formed after the Suriname troops committed mass murder against 35 people in Moiwana Village, near Moengo, after the Suriname national army failed to capture Ronnie Brunswijk. The Commando fought against Dési Bouterse and the Surinamese army in the Suriname Guerrilla War.

The Jungle Commando fought a guerrilla war against the Surinamese government of Dési Bouterse in the 1980s, before a truce was negotiated in March 1991.

At one time the Jungle Commando controlled a large area in East Suriname.

In 2005, Brunswijk warned that the Jungle Commando could resume fighting if the 1992 Kourou peace accord&#x27;s conditions were not met.

== First appearances ==
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Surinamese people began witnessing a dramatic fall in respect for traditional leaders and their practices, under the current government and place. In response to this was the emergence of the Suriname National Liberation Army, a militant resistance group that struggled in an attempt to disband the current military leadership of the country and constitute a democracy. Locals referred to the group as the Jungle Commando as it was formed by high-ranking officials who had previously fled the military, most notably Ronnie Brunswijk. Brunswijk was previously involved in a military coup in which the previous government was overthrown in 1980. He and a small group of deserters attacked 12 soldiers at a military outpost in Stolkertsijver on July 22, 1986. While holding this group of soldiers hostage, another attack was launched on the army barracks in Albina. The National Army responded by destroying the temple in Moengotapoe, and capturing all males present. Later Brunswijk&#x27;s birth village of Moiwana was attacked which resulted in the death of at least 35 people.

These attacks served as the catalyst for the Surinamese Interior War.

== Involvement in Moengo ==
The Jungle Commando would soon begin primarily acting in and around the town of Moengo. On August 20, 1986, the bauxite processing plants responsible for most of the economic prosperity in the area would be shut down by the Suriname Aluminum Company due to the Jungle Commandos&#x27; increased presence in the area. The following day, on August 21, the Jungle Commandos attacked a nearby military platoon at Ajumara Kondre. These attacks led to the jungle commandos&#x27; possessing primary control over the Marowijne, Lawa, and Tapanahoni rivers. This control over the local waterways eventually resulted in many hijackings. The first of which took place that September when the jungle commando ceased control over an engined Cessna at Apetina. Nearing the end of November 1986, the Jungle Commando would be responsible for the destruction of two bridges on the east–west highway into Moengo, leading to their inevitable takeover of the area. Soon after, on December 1, the Surinamese government would issue a state of emergency for the area, and on the following day, the Jungle Commando would be driven out of Moengo. In late December, the Jungle Commando would kidnap the son of &quot;Granman&quot; Belfon Aboikoni to signal that they were still in the area and had only moved up river toward central Suriname. In January 1987, the Jungle Commando bombed multiple power lines, causing an aluminum refinery to shut down and a citywide blackout to occur in Paramaribo because of the Afobaka dam losing power. The next month, in February, the Moengo powerhouse would be destroyed, as well as a palm oil plantation in Patamacca. This caused the village of Pokigron to request military support to help ward off the Jungle Commandos as the area was now in economic disarray. In May 1987, the Jungle Commandos continued to attack Moengo and Albina until military forces secured the area. Over the next two years, the military presence would dwindle again and the Jungle Commando would return to take over Moengo for a second time in October 1989, this time with the help of a splinter group headed by Kofi Ajomopong.

== Interactions with new government ==
In September 1987, a referendum was held in which the government approved a new draft of the Constitution, paving the way for democracy in the Republic of Suriname. On November 25, elections were held in which forty of the fifty-one seats were filled by members of the traditional party. This would lead to little change as the government continued to undermine its citizens and commit human rights violations one after the other. In their continual pursuit of the head of the Jungle Commando, the military continued capturing locals they claimed were rebels and executing them. These killings would continue until 1989, when the Jungle Commandos&#x27; prevalence in the area began to rise in retaliation. The village of Pokigron was completely burned to the ground by members of the Jungle Commando. Several businesses and homes were also targeted in the town of Brownsweg several days later. On August 31, the Jungle Commando would hijack a ferry containing over forty vehicles 54 miles west of Paramaribo on the Coppename River. The ferry was then brought up river where the Jungle Commando would use this equipment to take control of Carib and Arowak. Shortly after this series of attacks, the government would begin pursuing negotiations with the Jungle Commando in late November.

== Peace attempts ==
In June 1989, the Jungle Commando and the Surinamese government agreed to a cease fire. On July 21, the two parties signed the Accord of Kaurou to formally recognize the agreement. It was intended that the ex-fighters would be incorporated into the police force, but the Amerindian people fought against this proposition, saying that their people would be subjected to the will of the Jungle Commando and at their mercy. This would also call into question the status of the kin-ordered society. While the government, the National Assembly overseeing the matter, and the French government endorsed the agreement, the Surinamese Army rejected the idea of peace and continued to pursue members of the commando. On March 24, 1990, the presidential palace would serve as the nesting grounds of the people&#x27;s government, about which talks resurfaced. These talks were helmed by the sitting president at the time, and they were attended by refugee leaders from France and members of the jungle commando. This attempt at peace quickly fell through as tensions in the government rose as the government was made aware of potential drug trafficking the militant group was involved with. Several days prior, an airplane containing over 100 kilos of cocaine was discovered in the Moengo area. After a military coup occurred again in 1991, the permanent council of the OAS issued an appeal in an attempt to reestablish the democratic order that had previously been unstated. One year later, in 1992, the newly elected president, Venetian, would introduce the Peace Commission, beginning the process that would ultimately cause the conflict between the jungle commando and its splinter groups and the Surinamese government to end.

<text>In mathematics, Seifert–Weber space (introduced by Herbert Seifert and Constantin Weber) is a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. It is also known as Seifert–Weber dodecahedral space and hyperbolic dodecahedral space. It is one of the first discovered examples of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

It is constructed by gluing each face of a dodecahedron to its opposite in a way that produces a closed 3-manifold. There are three ways to do this gluing consistently. Opposite faces are misaligned by 1/10 of a turn, so to match them they must be rotated by 1/10, 3/10 or 5/10 turn; a rotation of 3/10 gives the Seifert–Weber space. Rotation of 1/10 gives the Poincaré homology sphere, and rotation by 5/10 gives 3-dimensional real projective space.

With the 3/10-turn gluing pattern, the edges of the original dodecahedron are glued to each other in groups of five. Thus, in the Seifert–Weber space, each edge is surrounded by five pentagonal faces, and the dihedral angle between these pentagons is 72°. This does not match the 117° dihedral angle of a regular dodecahedron in Euclidean space, but in hyperbolic space there exist regular dodecahedra with any dihedral angle between 60° and 117°, and the hyperbolic dodecahedron with dihedral angle 72° may be used to give the Seifert–Weber space a geometric structure as a hyperbolic manifold.
It is a (finite volume) quotient space of the (non-finite volume) order-5 dodecahedral honeycomb, a regular tessellation of hyperbolic 3-space by dodecahedra with this dihedral angle.

The Seifert–Weber space is a rational homology sphere, and its first homology group is isomorphic to formula_1. William Thurston conjectured that the Seifert–Weber space is not a Haken manifold, that is, it does not contain any incompressible surfaces; proved the conjecture with the aid of their computer software Regina.

<text>Bugojno () is a town and municipality in the Central Bosnia Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is situated on the river Vrbas, to the northwest of Sarajevo. According to the 2013 census, the town has a population of 15,555 inhabitants, with 31,470 inhabitants in the municipality. 

To the west towards Kupres is a region called Koprivnica. This enormous forest was once one of President Tito&#x27;s favorite hunting spots. The uninhabited dense forest has created a sanctuary for wild animals. Hunting associations are very active in this region and there are many mountain and hunting lodges dotting the forest. Duboka Valley (lit. &quot;deep valley&quot;) is a designated hunting area covered by thick spruce. Kalin Mountain is a popular weekend area for hikers and nature lovers.

==Geography==

The municipality has an average elevation of 570 metres above sea level. Much of its 366 km sq. is forested. The terrain is mountainous with several prominent features. Stožer (1,662 m), Kalin (1,530 m) and Rudina (1,385 m) are the tallest mountains in Bugojno.

==Demographics==
The town and municipality is inhabited by a Bosniak majority. The town, prior to the war, was multi-ethnic, with virtually identical numbers of Croats, Bosniaks and Serbs. Today, only 325 Serbs live in the town, with 376 in the municipality. The number of Croats in the municipality has gone down from 16,031 to 5,767 (2013 census). 

===Town===
In 1991 town of Bugojno had a population of 22,641 including;

*Bosniaks (6,878)
*Croats (6,836)
*Serbs (6,809)
*Yugoslavs (1,449)
* and 667 others

===Municipality===
==Climate==
The climate in Bugojno is continental. Summers are usually warm and dry, with average temperatures that can reach or exceed 30°C. Sunny days are common, but occasional short showers can occur, especially in late summer. Nights are relatively cool, providing relief from the daytime heat. Winters are cold and snowy. Temperatures often drop below 0°C, and the snow cover remains on the ground for most of the winter. Frost is common, which can cause ice and slippery conditions on roads and sidewalks. Climate change increasingly affects this region, resulting in variations in precipitation frequency and intensity, as well as temperature extremes. The hottest day on record was August 24, 2007, at 39.3°C, while the coldest was February 17, 1956, at -31.2 °C. The highest annual precipitation was recorded in 1895 at 1117 mm, while the lowest was in 2011 at 522 mm.

==Economy==
Bugojno was once a major industrial centre in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1981, Bugojno&#x27;s GDP per capita was 98% of the Yugoslav average. However, hardships caused by the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina took a toll on the industry and overall economy of Bugojno. Apart from industry, forestry has been an important contributor to the local economy and continues to be. In recent years, agriculture has grown in sustaining the Bugojno&#x27;s economy as many people are investing in land and agronomy.

==Notable people==
*Edin Atić (born 1997), basketball player
*Željko Bebek (born 1945), singer
*Ivona Dadic (born 1993), Austrian heptathlete, whose parents were born in Bugojno

<text>Hartley is a village and civil parish in the Sevenoaks district of Kent, England. It is located south west of Gravesend and the same distance south east of Dartford.

==History==
The village of Hartley is recorded as &quot;Erclei&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. your girl is a slaves. The name Hartley means &quot;place in the wood where the deer are&quot;. The parish church of All Saints dates from the early 12th century, although it probably replaced an earlier Anglo-Saxon building.

On 28 January 1554, during Wyatt&#x27;s Rebellion against Queen Mary, a rebel force of about 500 men led by Henry Isley clashed with a similar-sized loyal force led by Lord Abergavenny and Sir Robert Southwell, at Wrotham Hill. After a running battle over about four miles, the rebels made their last stand at Hartley Wood, where they were defeated.

By 1872, there were 47 houses in Hartley with a population of 244. Some local farms specialised in hop growing. A National School was built in the village in 1841; it was rebuilt in 1960 on a new site.

The opening nearby of Longfield railway station in 1872 began the evolution of the village from an agricultural to a commuter community. Just before World War I, two agricultural estates were purchased by a property developer and sold off in small plots for new houses and bungalows. In 1944 Government plans for a major London overspill town based on Hartley/Longfield/Meopham were developed, which ultimately came to nothing. However major housing developments at New Ash Green in the 1960s and Wellfield in the 1970s continued the trend.

The parish was part of Axstane Hundred and later Dartford Rural District. It is part of the parliamentary constituency of Dartford.

==Places of worship==
All Saints Church, the Anglican parish church, is Grade I-listed and dates from the 12th century. It is supplemented by the All Saints Church Centre in the centre of the village, which is used as a church hall and for worship. St Francis de Sales&#x27; Roman Catholic church, a Grade II-listed building, is a 17th-century former barn with timber framing and a thatched roof. Hartley United Reformed Church (formerly Congregational) was registered for worship in 1936 but has closed and was put up for sale, before being demolished and turned into housing.

==Sports==
Hartley Country Club cricket section were the Kent Cricket League Premier Champions in 2008, 2011-2013 and 2015.

The Pétanque section membership at Hartley Country Club currently numbers about ninety players, split equally between men and women.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Hartley is served by Longfield railway station with Southeastern services to London Victoria via Bromley South, Ramsagate via Chatham and Dover Priory via Chatham and Canterbury East.
===Buses===
Hartley is served by the Arriva Kent Thameside route 489, previously also the 423 and 433. This connects it with Gravesend.

<text>Freefolk is a village in Hampshire, England. It lies to the west and almost directly alongside the village of Laverstoke; the two villages are separated by the River Test.
It is about east of Whitchurch and west of Overton on the B3400 road between Basingstoke and Andover.

In the village is an inn named the &quot;Watership Down&quot;, known locally as &quot;the jerry&quot;. Built in 1840, it was called the Freefolk Arms but was renamed in honour of local author Richard Adams and his book &quot;Watership Down&quot;, which took its name from the down about to the north of the village.

The village name was brought to many people&#x27;s attention by the &quot;Forever Freefolk&quot; garden at the 2016 Chelsea Flower Show, sponsored by Brewin Dolphin and designed by Rosy Hardy of local nursery Hardy&#x27;s Cottage Garden Plants. The garden highlighted the fragility of England&#x27;s chalk streams, and won a silver medal.

==Governance==
The village is part of the civil parish of Laverstoke and is part of the Overton, Laverstoke and Steventon ward of Basingstoke and Deane borough council. The borough council is a Non-metropolitan district of Hampshire County Council.

<doc id="1233799" wikidata="Q7133645" url="?curid=1233799" title="Para Draine">
<text>Para Draine (born December 28, 1972) is an American female boxer who has been a world champion two times. She is a former 112-pound and current 115-pound champion. Draine stands 5’8” tall, making her relatively tall for a boxer of her weight.

Draine&#x27;s nicknames are &quot;Hurricane&quot; and &quot;The Spokane Spike&quot;. The latter nickname reflects the city she currently resides at. Draine has fought a large part of her fights in the American Northwest, specially in Worley, Idaho, but, because of her achievements, she has become well known in the world of boxing.

Her first professional fight came on May 14, 1997, when she defeated Dolores Lira by a four round decision, at Worley. Her first knockout win was on June 25 of that same year, when she beat Trena Drotar in the fourth round. Draine won her first five fights.

After she beat the experienced Sue Chase in her fifth fight, she and her management team thought she was ready for a world title try, so, on November 12, she challenged Theresa Arnold for the IBA&#x27;s women&#x27;s version of the world Bantamweight title. She lost that fight by a ten round split decision.

Draine then decided to go down in weight and try to become a world Flyweight champion. After two wins, including one over the famed British boxer Michelle Sutcliffe, she challenged the WIBF world Flyweight champion, Yvonne Trevino. On August 8, 1998, at Spirit Lake, North Dakota, Draine became a world champion by beating Trevino by a ten round split decision. She is a boxer who often jumps from one division to another, so she returned to the Bantamweight division. Despite losing her next fight, she got a world title try in her first fight at as a Super Bantamweight: On April 18, 1999, she and Silke Weikenmeyer fought for the vacant WIBF Super Bantamweight title. In what was Draine&#x27;s first overseas fight, she lost a ten round decision in Germany.

Next, she beat two well known opponents, Jo Wyman and Brenda Burnside, before once again returning to the Flyweight division, to make her first title defense: on April 6, 2000, she lost her title to the then 8-0 Margaret Sidoriff, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Draine kept fighting well known female boxers after losing that fight: she beat Robin Pinto, lost to Yvonne Caples, drew (tied) with Marylin Salcedo, and beat Bridgett Riley before receiving another world title shot.

On December 18, 2002, she and Salcedo were rematched, with the vacant IFBA world Super Flyweight title on the line. Draine became world Super Flyweight champion by defeating Salcedo with a split decision.

<text>H. (Hanumanthappa) Narasimhaiah (more popularly Hosur Narasimhaiah); 6 June 1920 – 31 January 2005) was an Indian physicist, educator, writer, freedom fighter and rationalist from Karnataka. Publicly known as &quot;HN&quot;, he was the Vice-Chancellor of Bangalore University and the president of the National Education Society. He was conferred the Padma Bhushan award by the Government of India in 1984.

As there was no formal school in Hale Upparahalli, where he was born, he attended the Government School in Gauribidanur, and continued high school at the National High School, Basavanagudi in Bangalore. He walked 85 km for two days to reach the city. A meeting with Mahatma Gandhi in 1936, in which he served as an interpreter to Gandhi, inspired him to follow Gandhism the rest of his life. While in his final year of BSc at the Central College of Bangalore, he gave up his education to join Gandhi&#x27;s Quit India movement in 1942. He was arrested and imprisoned for about nine months.

He finished his bachelor&#x27;s degree with physics honours in 1944, and master&#x27;s degree in 1946. He was immediately recruited to the faculty of physics at the National College, Bangalore, where he taught until 1957. He went for doctoral research in the United States and earned a PhD in 1960 in nuclear physics from Ohio State University. From 1961 he was Principal of the National College, Basavanagudi. He became the Vice-Chancellor of the Bangalore University in 1972, the post he held until his resignation in 1977. He went on to serve in the Karnataka Legislative Council.

A self-proclaimed rationalist, he was a renowned sceptic. While in office, he constituted and chaired the &quot;Committee to Investigate Miracles and Other Verifiable Superstitions&quot; that led to public challenges of the miraculous claims of Hindu godmen, including Sathya Sai Baba and Sai Krishna. As a leader of the Karnataka legislators to investigate a black-magic curse called banamathi, he disproved the existence of such claims. He was the founder of the Bangalore Science Forum. He is so far the only Indian to become elected Fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.

== Life ==

Narasimhaiah was born in Hale Upparahalli, a village near Gauribidanur in Karnataka, India. His father was a village school teacher, and mother, a labourer. He had a younger sister. Having no formal school in his village, he attended the Government School in Gauribidanur, the nearest town. He completed his elementary education in the primary school, which had no further studies beyond eighth standard. He stopped school for a year. His school headmaster M.S. Narayana Rao, who had just been transferred to the National High School, Basavanagudi in Bangalore, invited and helped him get admission in his new school. Without money, he went on foot to Bangalore (about 85 km), taking two days to arrive, and joined the school in 1935. He stayed with his headmaster for six months, until he could get allotment in the school hostel, the Poor Boys&#x27; Home, as he called it. He met with Mahatma Gandhi when the latter visited the National High School in 1936. His teacher selected him to be the interpreter of Gandhi&#x27;s Hindi speech into Kannada. From this moment on, his life was entirely influenced by Gandhi&#x27;s views and lifestyle, including wearing &quot;khadi&quot; throughout his life. He went on to Central College of Bangalore studying for his B.Sc. During his final year in 1942, Gandhi launched the Quit India movement to end British rule. He gave up his degree to join the movement, the event which he described as &quot;the most momentous decision in my life.&quot; The consequence of his decision was his imprisonment for nearly nine months, in different jails, in Yerwada Central Jail, in Mysore jail and in the Central Jail in Bangalore. Comparing his Central College hostel and the Central Jail, he remarked that he found &quot;no difference&quot; between the two as both provided him &quot;free boarding and lodging.&quot; After a year he completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree, B.Sc. with physics honours. He earned his MSc in physics with first class from the Central College in 1946. The same year he started his academic career as a lecturer at the National College, Bangalore.

After teaching for over ten years, in 1957, he went to Columbus, Ohio, for further degree. He received his PhD degree in nuclear physics from the Ohio State University in 1960. His thesis was &quot;The Radioactive Decay of Hafnium and Thulium Isotopes&quot;. From 1961 to 1972 he was Principal of the National College, Basavanagudi, in Bangalore.

He became the fourth Vice-Chancellor of the Bangalore University from 1972, and was reappointed in 1975. He remained in office until 1977, during this time he introduced psychology, social work, drama, music and dance as new subjects. He went on to serve the Karnataka Legislative Council. At the time of his death, he was the President of the National Education Society of Karnataka.

Narasimhiah was a connoisseur of Carnatic Music and had close association with the renowned Carnatic Musician R K Padmanabha. R K Padmanabha led a 1000 people goshti in remembrance of Dr H Narasimhiah as a mark of respect.

Narasimhaiah remained a confirmed bachelor. He quipped,

He was considered as champion of humanism and atheism in India. But he described himself as rationalist, and added,

In his later years, he suffered from prolonged septicaemia and died on 31 January 2005 in an intensive care unit of Maiya Multi-speciality Hospital in Bangalore. His body was kept in the National High School for public viewing. He was cremated, as he had willed (he had reserved INR 2,000 for it), at Hossur with a state official funeral the same day evening.

== Contributions ==

Narasimhaiah wrote a collection of essays titled &quot;Tereda Mana&quot; (&#x27;ತೆರೆದ ಮನ&#x27;, Open Mind) and an autobiography named &quot;Horaatada Haadi&quot; (&#x27;ಹೋರಾಟದ ಹಾದಿ&#x27;, The Path of Struggle).

In 1962, he founded the Bangalore Science Forum, which conducts a weekly series of public lectures on science topics. This non-profit organisation has conducted almost 2,000 popular science lectures by eminent scientists and over 500 popular science films. He was also responsible for establishing the Bangalore Lalithakala Parishat and B.V. Jagadeesh Science Centre.

As a Vice-Chancellor, he constituted and chaired the &quot;Committee to Investigate Miracles and Other Verifiable Superstitions&quot; in 1976. Members of the committee included scientists, academics and rationalists such as A.R. Vasudeva Murthy, Roddam Narasimha, Vinodha Murthy, Anupama Niranjana and A.M. Dharmalingam. The committee aimed to debunk claims of miracles and paranormal phenomena, specifically by Hindu godmen. The first challenged was Sathya Sai Baba, one of the most prominent godmen of India, who was observed to materialise holy ash and objects out of thin air, among other reported miracles such as bi-location and healing of the sick and wounded. Narasimhaiah personally wrote three letters to Sai Baba asking him to publicly demonstrate the miracles under controlled conditions. Sai Baba refused to comply, and remarked, &quot;Science must confine its inquiry only to things belonging to the human senses, while spiritualism transcends the senses.&quot; Narasimhaiah commented this refusal as indication of fraudulence in the miracle stories. A public controversy and debate then ensued. When the committee requested to visit Sai Baba, he locked himself in. The committee was also involved in exposing a 7-year old Sai Krishna of Pandavapura (a tiny village near Mysore), a mini-Avatar and an alleged protégé of Sathya Sai Baba. This exposition compelled many godmen to admit that they did not have special abilities. The committee was dissolved in 1977, as he was forced to resign from the office of Vice Chancellor.

In 1985, Narasimhaiah challenged a godman, Shivabalayogi, who claimed that he could let down rain by praying. To test the claim, Shivabalayogi was to specifically fill up the T.G. Halli reservoir by rain to feed Bangalore. It never rained.

Although a Hindu by birth, Narasimhaiah refused to practice religious rituals. He did not perform tonsure (cutting the hair off the head) upon the death of his father. He would eat food during a solar eclipse to demonstrate that it does not cause indigestion, as Hindus believed to be so and would fast. He did inaugurate the procession at Dasara, a festival with homage to Goddess Chamundeshwari, in 2004. But he explained that it was out of respect of &quot;tradition and culture&quot;.

His famous quote is: A poor teacher complains, an average teacher explains, a good teacher teaches, a great teacher inspires.

== Awards and honours ==

Narasimhaiah was conferred the Padma Bhushan in 1984, the third highest civilian awards instituted by the Government of India, for his services in literature and education. He received the &quot;Tamrapatra&quot; award for his participation in the Indian Freedom Struggle. For his contribution to the popularisation of science he won the Sir M Vishweshwaraiah Award. He was also the only Indian to be elected Fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP International), set up by Paul Kurtz in the USA. He received the Sahitya Akademi book prizes for his books &quot;Horaatada Haadi&quot; and &quot;Tereda Mana&quot;. In 1983, he was elected the president of Indian Rationalist Association. He was awarded the Rajyotsava Prashasti, the second highest civilian honour, and Basava Puraskara (2001) of the Karnataka state government. He also received the Karnataka Nataka Academy Fellowship in 1990, the Nadoja award (equivalent to Honorary Doctor of Letters) by Kannada University at Hampi, in 1996, and Honorary D.Lit from the Gulbarga University. In 1995, the Government of India (under the ministry led by Deve Gowda) appointed him Chairman of the Kannada Development Authority. In 1980, the Karnataka state government under Gundu Rao nominated him to the Karnataka Legislative Council, which he refused. He served as an independent legislator. He became the head of a legislature committee which investigated banamathi (a black magic involving curse) in some villages of northern Karnataka. His committee concluded that there was no such thing. He was awarded the Goruru Award in 2001. In 2003, he received the Jawaharlal Nehru National Prize for popularising science, on behalf of the Karnataka Science Forum. He was awarded by the then Prime Minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee. In April 2011 the executive council of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI, formerly Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal) selected Narasimhaiah for inclusion in CSI&#x27;s Pantheon of Skeptics. The Pantheon of Skeptics was created by CSI to remember the legacy of deceased fellows of CSI and their contributions to the cause of scientific skepticism.

There is a school named in his honour, H. Narasimhaiah Memorial High School in Hossur, established in 1991.

<text>St Albans City Football Club (nicknamed &quot;The Saints&quot;) is a semi-professional association football team based in St Albans, Hertfordshire, England. The club currently competes in the National League South, the sixth level of the English football league system.

It was founded in 1908 and plays its home matches at Clarence Park, about 800 yards from the city centre. It competed in the Conference Premier (now the National League) during the 2006–07 season under the guidance of the then chairman and Manager Colin Lippiat, but was relegated back to the Conference South after one season and subsequently suffered a further relegation in 2010–11, before returning to the sixth tier in 2013–14 after beating Chesham United 3–1 in the play-off final.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Formed in April 1908, St Albans City FC became members both the Spartan League Eastern Division and the Herts County League Western Division. City were champions of the Spartan League Eastern Division and the Herts County League Western Division in 1909–10. St Albans joined the Athenian League in 1920 and won the Athenian League in 1920–21 and 1921–22.

City&#x27;s most famous match was arguably on 22 November 1922 in a fourth round qualifying FA Cup match. Having been held by Dulwich Hamlet to a 1–1 draw at Clarence Park on 18 November, the replay drew a gate of 4,060. City&#x27;s New Zealand-born goalkeeper W. Tennant did not appear, his place taken by Alf Fearn who was usually a half-back with the reserves. Dulwich put eight goals past him, the winning goal coming in near darkness at the end of extra time. What put the game in the record books was that City scored seven times, with all seven goals being scored by Wilfred Minter. His feat remains the highest tally by a player on the losing side of an FA Cup tie.

St Albans joined the Isthmian League in 1923 and won it in 1923–24, 1926–27 and 1927–28. City were runners-up in the Isthmian League in 1954–55. In 1973–74, the Saints were relegated from the Isthmian League Premier Division to Division Two along with Corinthian Casuals, being the first clubs to be relegated within the Isthmian League. Division Two was renamed Division One in 1977–78, and in 1982–83, St Albans were relegated to the new Division Two. However, City were promoted back to Division One a year later, with a second promotion to the Isthmian League Premier Division occurring in 1985–86. St Albans were semi-finalists in the 1998–99 FA Trophy, losing 4–3 over two legs to Forest Green Rovers.

===21st century===
In the 2003–04 Isthmian League, St Albans finished 19th in the Isthmian League, but due to a restructuring, they participated in a play-off for a position in the newly formed Conference South. They won the play-off, beating Heybridge Swifts 4–3 and Bedford Town 5–4. In the 2005–06 season, St Albans City beat Histon 2–0, in the Conference South play-off final at Broadhall Way to earn their first promotion to the Conference National. The club was unable to consolidate their position in the fifth tier and were relegated in bottom position. After relegation to the Conference South, St Albans struggled but would ultimately survive from another relegation. In Summer 2009, it was announced that Gibson&#x27;s building firm, William Verry, were to go into administration with debts mounting continuously. Gibson himself released a statement in regards to the club&#x27;s future, stating that it was safe.

On 4 February 2011, the F.A. fined St Albans £7,500 and deducted 10 league points. The punishment was handed down to City chairman John Gibson and then vice-chairman Alasdair McMillin during a Regulatory Hearing at the Association&#x27;s offices at Wembley, and was in relation to alleged illegal payments to players, described by the FA as financial irregularities, by the club during the 2008–09 season. St Albans were relegated to the Southern League Premier Division at the end of the 2010–11 season. On 12 May 2011, it was announced that local businessmen Lawrence Levy and John Mcgowan had bought the club from previous chairman John Gibson for an undisclosed fee. Now playing in the Southern League Premier Division for the first time in their history and at their lowest level for over 20 years, the saints finished 8th. The 2013–14 season saw an indifferent start to the season, nevertheless, St Albans reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2002, eventually losing 8–1 at home to League Two Mansfield Town in front of an excess of 3,000 supporters. After setting a record of away wins in a season of 16, they finished the season in 4th place. In the play-offs, they defeated Chesham United 3–1 in the final to earn promotion to the Conference South. In their first season back in the division, they finished 13th.

They reached the first round of the FA Cup in the 2016–17 season, meeting League Two side Carlisle United but lost 5–3 at home. In the 2021–22 season, St Albans were in the hat for the first round of the FA Cup for the first time since 2016. They beat League Two leaders Forest Green Rovers in the first round but lost to Hertfordshire rivals Boreham Wood in the second. In the 2022–23 season, they finished 6th in the league on 75 points. After defeating Chelmsford City and then Dartford on penalties, St Albans would face Oxford City in the play-off final. They would lose 4–0 in the final after four first half goals. In the following season, manager David Noble joined Wealdstone in January 2024 and was later replaced by Jon Meakes. St Albans finished the season in 11th place. Following the end of the season David Noble was bought back as Head Coach with Meakes returning to his position as assistant

<text>BOB FM is the on-air brand of a number of FM radio stations in the United States and formerly in Canada. The BOB FM format mostly concentrates on album rock, alternative rock and pop hits from the 1980s and 1990s, especially those popular during the early days of MTV when music videos made up most of MTV&#x27;s schedule. However, BOB FM also features a smattering of oldies from the 1970s or earlier and classic hits from the 1990s or later.

Once or twice an hour, an unexpected song will get played, sometimes a dance hit or novelty song. BOB FM stations are quite similar to those using the moniker Jack FM. On many BOB FM and JACK FM stations, disc jockeys are not used or are only heard in morning drive time. Instead of a live DJ, a prerecorded voice will make sarcastic or ironic quips between songs.

BOB FM stations in Canada were all owned by Bell Media. Those in the United States are owned by a variety of companies. Bob FM stations are officially classified as variety hits or [[adult hits]] by radio research companies.

== Origins ==
It was originally named for the &quot;Best of the Best&quot;, and subsequently associated with an everyday character named &quot;Bob.&quot; It proved very successful in its first implementation on Winnipeg, Manitoba&#x27;s CFWM. It inspired Rogers Communications to license the JACK FM format at many of its stations, Corus Entertainment&#x27;s subsequent Joe FM and Dave FM brands, and comparable moves at other stations. Currently a syndicated version of the format is offered by Envision Radio Networks. As with Jack FM, Bob FM stations have playlists of over 1000 songs as opposed to most other commercial stations which play about 500 songs or less.

The format was largely conceived and created by Howard Kroeger, a former programming executive at CHUM Group Radio, after attending a friend&#x27;s 40th birthday party in 2000. He took the &quot;Bob&quot; moniker from a country music station (then WBOB, today KFXN-FM) that had broadcast in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market of Minnesota to the south several years earlier.

== Slogans ==
Many BOB FM stations use the catch phrase &quot;We Play Anything!&quot; or &quot;We Play Everything!&quot; Most stations market themselves with the slogan &quot;Turn your knob to BOB!&quot; This was parodied in a &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; skit in which TV&#x27;s Frank creates his own radio station and exhorts viewers to &quot;Turn your crank to Frank&quot;, satirizing commercials for BOB 100 FM that were playing in the Minneapolis area at the time.

Many Bob-FM stations are imaged by Digital Sound &amp; Video, Inc, located in Daytona Beach, Florida and voiced by Sean Caldwell.

== Country Music ==
At least two non variety-hits Bob FM outlets exist, WRBT in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and KLCI in Minneapolis-St. Paul, both of which run a country music format. Kroeger created a similar format and brand for country stations, using Hank FM (named for Country and Western legend Hank Williams) and DUKE FM (named for actor John Wayne).

HANK FM and DUKE FM can currently be heard in over twenty U.S. markets. The majority of these HANK FM and DUKE FM branded stations use the positioning statement of &quot;Playing the Legends of Country&quot; and are also distributed by Envision Radio Networks.

== Stations calling themselves &quot;BOB FM&quot; ==
CHUM Limited&#x27;s CKLY in Kawartha Lakes, Ontario, adopted the format on August 21, 2005, while WLFF in Lafayette, Indiana, jettisoned its country format to introduce Bob to its listeners on December 6, 2007.

The newest Bob FM station in the United States is WCVS-FM in Springfield, Illinois, replacing its classic rock format.

The newest Bob FM station in Canada was CKX-FM in Brandon, Manitoba, replacing its mainstream rock format.

The first international (non-American or Canadian) Bob FM launched in early 2016 in George Town, Grand Cayman in The Cayman Islands. 94.9 BOB FM, Grand Cayman ZFBB-FM of Hurley&#x27;s Media Ltd.

On March 18, 2021, the remaining Bob FM stations in Canada were re-branded as Bounce Radio.

<doc id="1233811" wikidata="Q751820" url="?curid=1233811" title="BJK İnönü Stadium">
<text>İnönü Stadium () was a football stadium in Istanbul, Turkey and the home ground of the football club Beşiktaş. Previously, the ground had also been shared with Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe. The ground was located in Dolmabahçe, close to Dolmabahçe Palace in the district of Beşiktaş, on the European side of Istanbul. The stadium was demolished except for the walls of the &quot;Eski Açık&quot; stand and its historical towers in order to build a new stadium for Beşiktaş at the same location.

The all-seater stadium had the capacity to host 32,145 spectators.

==Structure==
The BJK İnönü Stadyumu had four stands. The &quot;Kapalı&quot; stand which was parallel to the pitch at the north side could hold up to 5,881 supporters. It was regarded as the heart of the stadium, traditionally housing the most fanatical supporters. Facing the &quot;Kapalı&quot; was the &quot;Numaralı&quot; with a seating capacity of 5,237. The stands behind the goal areas were &quot;Eski Açık&quot; with a seating capacity of 7,962, and &quot;Yeni Açık&quot; with a seating capacity of 13,065. There were two towers on the left and right side of the &quot;Eski Açık&quot; stands that have been incorporated into the design of Vodafone Park, the current home of Beşiktaş. Before the stadium became an all-seater, the ground&#x27;s capacity was over 39,000.

The Bosphorus, Dolmabahçe Palace, Dolmabahçe Clock Tower, Dolmabahçe Mosque, and Maiden&#x27;s Tower were all viewable from the top rows of the &quot;Yeni Açık&quot; stand of the stadium, which made it the only stadium in the world from which a football fan could view two continents: Europe and Asia, which are separated by the Bosphorus strait.

==History==

BJK İnönü Stadium (originally named the Dolmabahçe Stadium) was designed by Italian architect Paolo Vietti-Violi, who collaborated with Turkish architects Şinasi Şahingiray and Fazıl Aysu for the project. The ground of Dolmabahçe Palace&#x27;s stable was chosen as the location to build the stadium. The first foundation was laid on 19 May 1939, but construction work was halted due to the outbreak of the Second World War. The stadium was eventually inaugurated on 19 May 1947, by İsmet İnönü, the second President of Turkey and himself a Beşiktaş fan, and Lütfi Kırdar, the Governor of Istanbul. The initial capacity was 16,000. In the original project plan, there were two bronze statues of athlete figures at the &quot;Eski Açık&quot; stand: one throwing a discus, and the other throwing a javelin. However, the statues were never built due to financial concerns. The oil factory which was found behind the stadium was demolished to construct the &quot;Yeni Açık&quot; stand at the west part of the stadium in 1950 (hence the name &quot;Yeni Açık&quot;, meaning the &quot;New Open&quot; stand - referring to the two covered stands &quot;Numaralı&quot; and &quot;Kapalı,&quot; and the other uncovered stand, &quot;Eski Açık&quot;). &quot;Yeni Açık&quot; was eventually covered with a separate roof structure in 2004. Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe shared the stadium with Beşiktaş for many years, until the construction of the Ali Sami Yen Stadium in 1964, and the renovation of Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in 1982.

The first football match at the Dolmabahçe Stadium took place between Beşiktaş and AIK Stockholm of Sweden, on 27 November 1947. The first goal in the stadium was scored by Süleyman Seba, the most famous and longest-presiding Chairman of the club (in the 1980s and 1990s), when he was a player at Beşiktaş. Beşiktaş lost this match 3–2. In 1952, the stadium was renamed as &quot;Mithat Paşa Stadium&quot;, and later in 1973, it was renamed as &quot;İnönü Stadium&quot;. A leasing contract was signed between Beşiktaş JK and the Ministry of Youth and Sports in February 1998 which gave all usage rights of İnönü Stadium to Beşiktaş JK for 49 years.

Renovation work took place at the stadium in 2004. The tartan track was removed within the scope of these renovations and the ground level was lowered by 4 meters to increase the capacity of the stadium to 32,145 spectators. The press seats were relocated to the &quot;Numaralı&quot; stand from the &quot;Kapalı&quot; stand. The executive suites that were found in the middle of the &quot;Kapalı&quot; stand were demolished and for the first time in Turkey, the wire fence between the stands and the pitch was removed for space. The number of gates was increased by 100%. A press center for Beşiktaş TV was built inside the stadium. Restrooms and lunch counters were also renovated. The &quot;Yeni Açık&quot; stand was covered with a metallic roof, and the stadium complied with UEFA standards.

The stadium&#x27;s location is near the Bosphorus and is very close to Taksim Square. The stadium could be reached easily by many means of public transport (bus, ferry, metro, light-rail, funicular etc.) due to its central location.

There were four different parts of the stadium: &quot;Kapalı&quot; was where the most hot-blooded fans were during the matches. &quot;Yeni Açık&quot; was on the western side, facing the Bosphorus. &quot;Eski Açık&quot; was the smaller stand opposite &quot;Yeni Açık&quot; where visiting supporters were typically seated. &quot;Numaralı&quot; is where press, VIP, and protocol seats were located.

The 2012-2013 season was the last season of İnönü Stadium as Beşiktaş&#x27;s home ground. The club played their 2013-14 and 2014-15 season home games mostly at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium and the Başakşehir Fatih Terim Stadium. Their new ground, Vodafone Park, was completed in April 2016.

== Records ==
==Music==
*İnönü Stadium was used for many major music concerts. The first concert to take place at the stadium was Bryan Adams on 28 July 1992. This marked the first stadium concert in Istanbul.
*Michael Jackson performed during his &quot;Dangerous World Tour&quot; on 23 September 1993 in front of a crowd of 48,000. He also scheduled to perform at the stadium during his Dangerous World Tour on 4 October 1992, but was cancelled due to a vocal cord ailment.
*Madonna performed during her &quot;The Girlie Show World Tour&quot; on 7 October 1993 to an audience of 54,000 people.
*Iron Maiden performed at the stadium on July 26, 2013 as part of their Maiden England World Tour, marking the stadium&#x27;s last concert before its demolition and reconstruction.
*Other major events in the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s included performances by: Guns N&#x27; Roses, as part of the Use Your Illusion Tour; Metallica as part of the Nowhere Else to Roam and World Magnetic Tour; Bon Jovi as part of the I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead Tour; Elton John as part of The One Tour; Scorpions as part of the Face The Heat Tour; Sting as part of the Ten Summoner&#x27;s Tales Tour; Rod Stewart as part of the A Spanner in the Works Tour; Tina Turner as part of the Wildest Dreams Tour and Rihanna as part of the Diamonds World Tour. The stadium also hosted the heavy metal Sonisphere Festival in 2010, featuring the &quot;big four&quot; of thrash metal: Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax, in addition to Manowar, Rammstein and Alice in Chains.

==New Inönü Stadium project==


Due to the unique location of the stadium and its legal status as a &quot;historic monument&quot; protected by the High Council of Monuments of Turkey, the renewal project had to be modified and postponed several times and all official requests, efforts, renewal attempts were denied until 2013. The administrative procedures were eventually completed, and all required permission was given to the club. Club president Fikret Orman announced that the new stadium, with a total capacity of 41,903 spectators, 143 luxury lodges, and one &quot;1903 stand&quot;, will be constructed. Demolition works started on 2 June 2013, following the end of the promotion play-offs of the TFF First League. Construction works were completed in April 2016, and the estimated cost of the project was around $80 million.

The project of the new stadium was designed by DB architects. The old stadium was demolished, except for the walls and two towers of the &quot;Eski Açık&quot; stand, since these structures are considered historic monuments.

<text>Charles Douglas Eastaughffe was an early Australian settler, later becoming a police trooper and Chief Constable of Dalby, Queensland.
==Biography==
Born in Inverness, Scotland c.1804, it is unclear when he first arrived in Australia but it seems to have been about 1835, spending time in Sydney where he married in 1840. There is some evidence that he lived under an alias at this time although the reason is not known.
In the early 1850s he moved to northern New South Wales, and served as a police trooper in Wellingrove, near Glen Innes. During this time he was involved in the pursuit of the bushranger Thomas Haywood, requesting the public&#x27;s help through newspaper appeals to the Morton Bay Courier.

In 1854, Charles Eastaughffe moved to the Darling Downs area and brought with him the official documentation proclaiming the town of Dalby on behalf of Captain Samuel Perry, the Deputy Surveyor-General of New South Wales. He was appointed Chief Constable of Dalby that same year, and a soon after the Governor General also appointed him as the region&#x27;s slaughter-house inspector.

Mr Eastaughffe held these appointments for a considerable time, and afterwards took to commercial pursuits, engaging in business as Auctioneer and Commission Agent. During Mr Eastaughffe&#x27;s residence in Dalby he was for several years a member of the Municipal Council, and at various times held positions of trust under the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland. He built a wool receiving store, which he subsequently converted into a theatre, which was well known by the name of Union Hall.

In the mid-1870s, Mr Eastaughffe left Dalby and went to Toowoomba for a couple of years.
Charles Eastaughffe retired to Nerang on Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast where he died on 13 February 1885.

<text>Frank William George Lloyd (2 February 1886 – 10 August 1960) was a Scottish-American film director, screenwriter, producer and actor. He was among the founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and was its president from 1934 to 1935.

He is Scotland&#x27;s first Academy Award winner and is unique in film history, having received three Oscar nominations in 1929 for his work on a silent film (&quot;The Divine Lady&quot;), a part-talkie (&quot;Weary River&quot;) and a full talkie (&quot;Drag&quot;). He won for &quot;The Divine Lady&quot;. He was nominated and won again in 1933 for his adaptation of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Cavalcade&quot; and received a further Best Director nomination in 1935 for perhaps his most successful film, &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;.

In 1957, he was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film. In 1960, Lloyd received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion pictures industry, at 6667 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Early life and career==
Lloyd was born in Cambuslang, on the outskirts of Glasgow, the youngest of seven children. His mother Jane was Scottish and his father Edmund Lloyd was Welsh, a mechanical engineer. The family travelled the country until his father was injured and gave up engineering. They settled in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London, where the family ran a pub. Lloyd worked in a shoe shop, sang in choral groups and joined a vaudeville group.

In 1909 he immigrated to Canada where he worked on a ranch in Alberta for a year. He also erected poles and wrote for a telephone company, then joined a travelling show as an actor and singer. The show wound up in Los Angeles in 1913 and Lloyd decided to stay there and act in Hollywood films.

==Film director==
===Paramount===
He began directing shorts for Paramount and moved to longer running films: &quot;The Gentleman from Indiana&quot; (1915), &quot;Jane&quot; (1915), &quot;The Reform Candidate&quot; (1916), &quot;The Tongues of Men&quot; (1916), &quot;The Call of the Cumberlands&quot; (1916), &quot;Madame la Presidente&quot; (1916) with Anna Held, &quot;The Code of Marcia Gray&quot; (1916), &quot;David Garrick (1916 film)&quot; (1916), &quot;The Making of Maddalena&quot; (1916), &quot;An International Marriage&quot; (1916), and &quot;The Stronger Love&quot; (1916). &quot;The Intrigue&quot; (1916) was produced through Pallas Films and released through Paramount. Lloyd&#x27;s biographer argued his early films &quot;are not &#x27;masterpieces,&#x27; but they are on a par with films from other secondary directors of the period. In other words, they are not comparable to those directed by D.W. Griffith, but are as good as those directed by Allan Dwan.&quot;

===Fox===
Lloyd directed &quot;Sins of Her Parent&quot; (1916) at Fox, and &quot;The World and the Woman&quot; (1916) with Jeanne Eagles for Tranhouser. Back at Fox he did &quot;The Kingdom of Love&quot; (1917), and a series of films starring William Farnum&quot; &quot;The Price of Silence&quot; (1917), &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1917) from the novel by Charles Dickens, &quot;American Methods&quot; (1917), &quot;When a Man Sees Red&quot; (1917), &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1917), &quot;The Heart of a Lion&quot; (1917), &quot;True Blue&quot; (1918), &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1918) from the novel by Zane Grey and its sequel &quot;The Rainbow Trail&quot; (1918), &quot;For Freedom&quot; (1918), and &quot;The Man Hunter&quot; (1919). Without Farnum, Lloyd directed &quot;The Blindness of Divorce&quot; (1918).

===Goldwyn===
At Goldwyn he made &quot;Pitfalls of a Big City&quot; (1919),&quot;The World and Its Woman&quot; (1919), &quot;The Loves of Letty&quot; (1919), &quot;The Woman in Room 13&quot; (1920), &quot;The Silver Horde (1920 film)&quot; (1920), &quot;Madame X&quot; (1920) with Pauline Frederick, &quot;The Great Lover&quot; (1920), &quot;A Tale of Two Worlds&quot; (1921), &quot;Roads of Destiny&quot; (1921) with Frederick, &quot;A Voice in the Dark&quot; (1921), &quot;The Invisible Power&quot; (1921), &quot;The Grim Comedian&quot; (1921), and &quot;The Man from Lost River&quot; (1921) plus &quot;The Sin Flood&quot; (1922) with Richard Dix.

===First National===
Lloyd directed some films for First National with Norma Talmadge: &quot;The Eternal Flame&quot; (1921), &quot;The Voice from the Minaret&quot; (1922), &quot;Within the Law&quot; (1923) and &quot;Ashes of Vengeance&quot; (1923).

Also for that studio was &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1922) with Lon Chaney and Jackie Coogan, and &quot;Black Oxen&quot; (1924).

He had his own company at First National, Frank Lloyd Productions. They made &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (1924), a swashbuckler with Milton Sills, then &quot;The Silent Watcher&quot; (1924), &quot;Her Husband&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1925), &quot;Winds of Chance&quot; (1925), &quot;The Splendid Road&quot; (1926), and &quot;The Wise Guy&quot; (1926).
===Paramount===
At Paramount Lloyd made &quot;The Eagle of the Sea&quot; (1926), &quot;Children of Divorce&quot; (1927), &quot;Adoration&quot; (1928) with Billie Dove, &quot;The Divine Lady&quot; (1929) with Corinne Griffith, and &quot;Dark Streets&quot; (1929). Lloyd won the Academy Award for Best director for &quot;The Divine Lady&quot;.

There were several films starring Richard Barthemless: &quot;Weary River&quot; (1929), &quot;Drag&quot; (1929), &quot;Young Nowheres&quot; (1930), &quot;Son of the Gods&quot; (1930), and &quot;The Lash&quot; (1930). He was Oscar nominated for Best Director for &quot;Drag&quot; and &quot;Weary River&quot;.

There was also &quot;The Way of All Men&quot; (1930), a remake of Lloyds&#x27; own &quot;The Sin Flood&quot;, &quot;The Right of Way&quot; (1931), and &quot;East Lynne&quot; (1931).

For Howard Hughes, Lloyd did &quot;The Age for Love&quot; (1931). Back at Fox he made &quot;A Passport to Hell&quot; (1932) then &quot;Cavalcade&quot; (1933), which won Lloyd the Oscar for Best Director.

Lloyd then made what was his favourite film, &quot;Berkeley Square&quot; (1933), starring Leslie Howard, followed by &quot;Hoop-La&quot; (1933) the final film of Clara Bow and &quot;Servants&#x27; Entrance&quot; (1934) with Janet Gaynor.

==&quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; and later career==
Lloyd had a huge hit with &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1935) at MGM which earned him another Oscar nomination for Best Director.

He followed it with &quot;Under Two Flags&quot; (1936) at Fox, a French Foreign Legion tale with Ronald Colman.
===Paramount===
At Paramount Lloyd made more historical films: &quot;Maid of Salem&quot; (1937) with Claudette Colbert, &quot;Wells Fargo&quot; (1937) with Joel McCrea, &quot;If I Were King&quot; (1938) with Colman and &quot;Rulers of the Sea&quot; (1938) with Douglas Fairbanks Jnr, which was a commercial disappointment.

===Universal===
Lloyd made &quot;The Howards of Virginia&quot; (1940) at Columbia with Cary Grant. At Universal he set up his own company. He directed &quot;This Woman Is Mine&quot; (1941), and &quot;The Lady from Cheyenne&quot; (1941), and his company produced &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942) from Alfred Hitchcock, &quot;The Spoilers&quot; (1942) with John Wayne and Randolph Scott, and &quot;Invisible Agent&quot; (1942).

He was one of several directors on RKO&#x27;s &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943). Lloyd had a big hit with James Cagney&#x27;s &quot;Blood on the Sun&quot; (1945). He was Oscar nominated for Best Director of a Documentary with &quot;The Last Bomb &quot; (1945). Lloyd also served in the air force. He retired from filmmaking in 1946, intending to live on a ranch.

===Final films===
Lloyd&#x27;s wife died in 1952 and he came out of retirement to make two films at Republic, &quot;The Shanghai Story&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1955) a film about Jim Bowie. When he remarried in 1955 he retired again.

==Personal life==
Frank Lloyd was married to actress Alma Haller from 11 July 1913, until her death on 16 March 1952. By 1955, Lloyd married Virginia Kellogg, and remained married until Lloyd&#x27;s death on 10 August 1960 at age 74. Lloyd was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

==Reputation==
Frank Lloyd does not have a significant reputation. His biographer puts this down partly to the dismissal of Lloyd&#x27;s work by Andrew Sarris (who compared the director unfavorably with Cecil B. de Mille) and &quot;because he was what is best described as a studio director. His style is as much the style of the studio as it is his own. He did not make waves; he did not overly publicize and promote himself. What he did was for the good of the studio – not for his own ego.&quot;

<doc id="1233829" wikidata="Q61284" url="?curid=1233829" title="Hans Heyer">
<text>Hans Heyer (; born 16 March 1943) is a German retired racing driver who mainly raced touring cars. He is most commonly known for starting one Formula One World Championship race, the 1977 German Grand Prix, despite failing to qualify.

Heyer&#x27;s trademark during his racing days was a &quot;Tirolerhut&quot;, a hat from Tyrol or Bavaria.

==Early life==
Heyer was born in Mönchengladbach, Germany to parents who ran a bitumen and a concrete mixing company. Heyer developed his passion for motor racing and engineering when he was at boarding school at Adenau, which is near the Nürburgring. He later started an apprenticeship with Daimler-Benz as a mechanic which was completed in 1962.

==Racing career==

===1960s===
Living close to the Netherlands and not yet allowed to race in Germany at the age of 16, he started his career there in 1959 with karts and won the 1962 Dutch Championship in the 100cc category which he followed up by winning the 125cc class in 1963. In an attempt to race in his native Germany, he initially encountered problems with his racing license but managed to compete in the Formula K class in 1965 finishing 3rd in the next two years and backed up with the German and European Formula K titles in 1968 to 1971 driving in a Taifun/BM. Heyer also raced in France by competing in the Brignoles 24 Hour Classic in 1969 to 1971 winning twice and finished 2nd in 1970.

===1970s===
For many years, Heyer was associated with Zakspeed, racing their Group 2 Ford Escorts in the European Touring Car Championship (champion 1974) and the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft (champion 1975 and 1976). Heyer attempted two European F2 races in 1976, finishing sixth at the first Hockenheim race. He failed to qualify for the second Hockenheim race and made no further attempts in F2.

In his single attempt at Formula One, he entered the 1977 German Grand Prix on 31 July 1977 with the second Penske car of the new German team ATS. With little experience in single seaters and a bad car, he did not qualify. He was the third reserve driver, meaning that he would get the chance to race if three drivers dropped out. But since Frank Williams chose not to prepare his driver Patrick Nève, who was the first reserve, for the race, and since Emilio de Villota, who was the second reserve, had a last-moment engine failure before the race, Heyer had effectively became the first reserve driver. Because of the crash and commotion on the starting grid at the start of the race, Heyer chose to start the race anyway, slipping out of the pits and joining the pack. Only when his gearbox failed after 9 laps was it realised that Heyer should not have been competing, whereupon he was disqualified. He never attempted another race in Formula One. He is the only driver to be credited with a DNQ (did not qualify), DNF (did not finish), and DSQ (disqualified) in the same race, technically being banned from 5 Formula One races afterwards (which effectively became a lifetime ban because he had no intention to compete any further in Formula One).

===1980s===
In 1980 he won the DRM again, this time for Lancia in a Group 5 Lancia Monte Carlo Turbo, a car he also helped develop. He crashed his 480 hp car badly at the Norisring in Nuremberg, rolling several times. Heyer switched to continuations cooling when control of the water supply failed when the brake light switch failed which had not worked resulting in the left front brake caliper failing which destroyed the tyre rod and a burst affected the front left tyre. He escaped unhurt, but returned immediately to the wreck to recover his famous hat. In the following medical exam, the doctor was said to have been more nervous than Hans was.

Heyer won the 12 Hours of Sebring race in 1984 driving alongside Stefan Johansson and Mauricio de Narvaez in a Porsche 935.

During the years that the Spa 24 Hours was run as part of the European Touring Car Championship and the inaugural World Touring Car Championship (1982–1988), Heyer won the race three times in succession. He won in 1982 driving a BMW 528i with Armin Hahne and Eddy Joosen, 1983 in a BMW 635 CSi with Hahne and Thierry Tassin, and finally in 1984 driving a TWR Jaguar XJS with Tom Walkinshaw and Win Percy.
Heyer retired in 1989 after 999 races in 30 years.

===1990s===
Between 1990 and 1991 Heyer worked at his family concrete works business but came out of retirement to test Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s truck racing vehicles and competed in the Nürburgring Truck Grand Prix in 1992. Heyer returned to the same track in 1994 to compete in the Nürburgring 24 Hours alongside Heiner Weiss, Rainer Braun driving a BMW M3 and returned to compete in the same race in 1995 albeit in a BMW veterans &#x27;Dream Team&#x27;. Heyer also competed in the Nürburgring 500 km race in 1997.

===2000s===
In 2004, Volkswagen director Kris Nissen found out Hans Heyer&#x27;s next race would be his 1000th and invited Hans Heyer to race in the ADAC Volkswagen Polo Cup at the Norisring against youngsters.

==Personal life==
His son Kenneth Heyer is also a racing driver, currently involved in the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup driving a Mercedes-AMG GT3 for MANN-FILTER HTP Motorsport.

<text>Heinz Schiller (Frauenfeld, Switzerland, January 25, 1930 – Montana, Switzerland, March 26, 2007), was a racing driver from Switzerland. He participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, on August 5, 1962. He retired from the race, scoring no championship points.

Schiller was a speedboat champion in his native Switzerland before turning to sports car racing, finding success during the mid-1950s. He then switched to single seater cars, starting in hillclimbing before moving up to circuit racing.

He first appeared in Formula One at the beginning of 1962 with Ecurie Nationale Suisse, driving their three-year-old Porsche in the Brussels Grand Prix, where he finished 8th on aggregate after the three heats. He subsequently drove the same car at the 1962 Pau Grand Prix, coming home 9th.

Under the Ecurie Filipinetti banner but still driving the same Porsche, Schiller failed to qualify at the Naples Grand Prix, largely because only 10 cars were permitted to take the start. He was entered by Ecurie Maarsbergen for the 1962 Belgian Grand Prix but was withdrawn, before finishing 7th in the Grosser Preis der Solitude for Ecurie Filipinetti. He then switched to a Lotus 24 for his single World Championship event, the 1962 German Grand Prix which ended with oil pressure problems, as did his attempt at the Mediterranean Grand Prix, now back in the Porsche.

Schiller made one appearance in Formula One in 1963, finishing 3rd at Pau but five laps down, again in the old Porsche, before returning to sports cars. He finished 10th at the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans with Gerhard Koch.

<text>Helmut Marko (born 27 April 1943) is an Austrian former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . In endurance racing, Marko won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Martini. He founded RSM Marko in 1989, and has been an advisor to Red Bull Racing and its related teams since 2005, winning six World Constructors&#x27; Championship titles between and .

Born and raised in Austria, Marko progressed to sportscar racing by the late-1960s after completing his doctorate in law at the University of Graz. Finding success in the European Touring Car Championship and becoming a class winner at the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans with Martini, Marko progressed to the premier class the following year and won the race in then-record distance alongside Gijs van Lennep. Less than two months later, Marko debuted in Formula One with Bonnier at the , driving a privateer McLaren M7C. He joined BRM for the remainder of the season, and retained his seat in . Marko was seriously injured during the 1972 French Grand Prix, when debris from the March of Ronnie Peterson pierced his visor and left him permanently blinded in his left eye, ending his racing career aged 29.

Since retiring from motor racing, Marko has moved into team and driver management, founding RSM Marko in 1989, which became the Red Bull Junior Team in 1999. With Red Bull, Marko has overseen the development of two Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Champions—Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen—and has been an advisor to Red Bull Racing since , winning six World Constructors&#x27; Championships with the team; the graduates of his development programme have won a combined eight World Drivers&#x27; Championships and Grands Prix.

==Early and personal life==

Marko was born in Graz on 27 April 1943, during Nazi-occupation of Austria. He was a school friend of Jochen Rindt, who later won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in . Marko graduated from the University of Graz in 1967 with a doctorate in law. Marko owns four hotels in Graz – the &quot;Schlossberghotel&quot;, &quot;Augartenhotel&quot;, &quot;Lendhotel&quot; and &quot;Kai 36&quot;. 

==Racing career==
Marko competed in several race series, including 10 Formula One Grands Prix in 1971 and 1972, but scored no World Championship points.

===Sportscar racing career===

He had more success in endurance racing, winning the 1971 24 Hours of Le Mans, driving a Martini-Porsche 917K with Gijs van Lennep. During that year, they set a distance record which remained unbeaten until the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans (5,335.313 km, at an average of 222.304 km/h - changes to the track reduced the average speed.)

At the Targa Florio, he drove the fastest laps around the 72 km Sicilian mountain circuit in the 1972 race, catching up over two minutes on the leader within two laps to finish second by a mere 17 seconds. His fastest lap in the Alfa Romeo 33 was 33 min 41 sec, at an average of 128.253 km/h.

===Formula One career===

Marko debuted in Formula One with Jo Bonnier&#x27;s Ecurie Bonnier at the , driving the McLaren M7C. He joined BRM for the remainder of the season, and retained his seat in . Marko was seriously injured during the 1972 French Grand Prix at Clermont-Ferrand, held a few weeks after the Targa Florio, when debris from the March of Ronnie Peterson pierced his visor and left him permanently blinded in his left eye, ending his racing career aged 29.

== Retirement from motor racing ==
Marko was the manager for Austrian racing drivers Gerhard Berger and Karl Wendlinger for several years prior to founding RSM Marko in 1989, a racing team who competed in Formula 3 and Formula 3000; running under the name Red Bull Junior Team from 1999 onwards. Since then, he has administered Red Bull&#x27;s driver development programme, which has seen several drivers progress to Formula One, including Sebastian Vettel, Daniel Ricciardo, Carlos Sainz Jr., Pierre Gasly and Max Verstappen. Marko&#x27;s Formula One graduates have a combined eight World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles and Grands Prix between them, with Vettel achieving the first in . Since 2005, he has been an advisor to all Formula One teams owned by Red Bull, including Red Bull Racing (2005–present) and its sister team, RB (2024–present). RB previously raced with the names Toro Rosso (2006–2019) and AlphaTauri (2020–2023).

==Use of offensive stereotypes==

Marko faced scrutiny in September 2023 for his comments regarding Red Bull Racing driver Sergio Pérez&#x27;s lack of form throughout the season, following the . Talking to Red Bull-owned broadcaster ServusTV, he was quoted saying &quot;we know that he has problems in qualifying, he has fluctuations in form, he is South American and he is just not as completely focused in his head as Max Verstappen is, or as Sebastian Vettel&quot;. Marko&#x27;s comments were widely perceived as racially charged, with many pointing out that Pérez—a Mexican national—is not South American. Marko apologised on 8 September, stating &quot;I was trying to make a point that [Pérez] has fluctuated in his performance this year, but it was wrong to attribute this to his cultural heritage.&quot; Pérez accepted Marko&#x27;s apology on 14 September, despite the FIA reprimanding him the following day.

<doc id="1233846" wikidata="Q172967" url="?curid=1233846" title="Hideki Noda">
<text>is a Japanese professional racing driver. He participated in three Formula One Grands Prix, debuting in the 1994 European Grand Prix, but did not score any championship points. He replaced Yannick Dalmas in the Larrousse car for the last three Grands Prix of the season, but failed to finish in any of the three races. In 1995, he joined Simtek as a test driver, hoping to get some races in. However, the Kobe earthquake and the folding of the Simtek team ended his brief Formula 1 career.

A year later, Noda went to America and raced in the Indy Lights and became the only Japanese driver to win a CART-sanctioned event. After a few years in America, Noda moved back to Japan, where he drove a Team Cerumo Toyota Supra with Hironori Takeuchi. In the annual non-championship All-Star event at Aida, Noda and Takeuchi were forced out with mechanical problems. In 1999, he joined the Esso Tiger Team Le Mans under Koichiro Mori, again to drive a Toyota Supra, ex-Australian V8 Supercar driver Wayne Gardner. The highlight of their season was a win at Fuji. With 33 points, they were equal 17th in the series.

In 2002, Noda returned to the United States and drove in six Indy Racing League IndyCar Series races for Convergent Racing and Indy Regency Racing with a best finish of 10th at Phoenix International Raceway while with Convergent. He also competed in a round of the inaugural A1 Grand Prix season with Japan at Lausitz, where he scored three points for the Japanese team.

==Career==
=== Formula One (1994-1995) ===
Noda replaced French driver Yannick Dalmas at Larrousse towards the end of the 1994 season at the European Grand Prix in Jerez. After qualifying 24th behind his teammate Érik Comas, he retired due to gearbox failure. At his home race in Japan, Noda was 23rd on the grid but retired again due, this time due to an electrical fault. His last Grand Prix saw him 23rd on the grid at Adelaide, this time out qualifying his new teammate Jean-Denis Délétraz. Noda again retired, this time due to an oil leak.

In 1995, Noda was due to drive for Simtek in Canada but the team withdrew from F1 before he could. In his last attempt to drive in F1, he was denied his super license, preventing him from driving for Forti at the TI Circuit for the Pacific Grand Prix.

=== A1 Grand Prix (2005–2009) ===
In 2005, Noda was announced as the second driver for the Japan entry for the 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix season, second to Ryo Fukuda. His first race for the team came at the second round at Lausitz, where he qualified in 21st place. In sprint race, Noda managed to move up 11 places to finish 10th and score one point for Japan. The feature race saw Noda finish one place higher in ninth place, scoring a further two points for the Japanese A1 GP team. Japan finished 21st at the end of the season, with eight points.

==Personal life==
Noda&#x27;s daughter Juju is also a racing driver, who competed in the W Series.

<text>Hubert Hahne (; 28 March 1935 – 24 April 2019) was a racing driver from Germany. He was the older brother of Armin Hahne, as well as the uncle of Jörg van Ommen.

==Career==
He participated in five Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, two of those at the wheel of Formula Two cars, and one non-Championship Formula One race.

Hahne was successful in touring car racing, including the European Touring Car Championship. In 1966, he raced a BMW New Class 2000TI. In the six-hour &quot;Großer Preis der Tourenwagen&quot; on 3 July 1966, an Alfa Romeo GTA had lowered the Nürburgring touring car race lap record to 10:08.9. A month later, in a support race for the 1966 German Grand Prix, Hahne was the first to lap the Nürburgring in under 10 minutes in a touring car, in 9:58.5.
On the old and very long Nürburgring, Formula Two cars occasionally had their own race alongside the Formula One cars in the same events to fill the field, which provided other drivers like Kurt Ahrens Jr., Gerhard Mitter and Dieter Quester the opportunity to enter the German Grand Prix. As the Formula Two section was counted separately, the drivers could not score World Championship points. Hahne participated in the 1966 and 1969 German Grands Prix in the special Formula Two sections of those events, but withdrew before the start of the 1969 event due to the fatal accident suffered by his team-mate Gerhard Mitter.

For his true Formula One debut at the 1967 German Grand Prix, Hahne drove a Formula Two Lola chassis fitted with a 2-litre 16 valve BMW engine, thus qualifying the drive for Formula One. The BMW factory were allowed to run this to give some national encouragement. He retired on lap 7 with suspension failure. The following year he finished 10th in the same car.

Hahne got himself a March 701 for 1970, but could not qualify for the 1970 German Grand Prix which was held at the Hockenheimring that year. Hahne claimed that chassis and engine were among the worst of the many March and Cosworth delivered that year. Ronnie Peterson showed later at Silverstone that this very car could reach adequate times, and Hahne retired from racing.

<text>Ian Hugh Gordon Ashley (born 26 October 1947) is a British-German racing driver who raced in Formula One for the Token, Williams, BRM and Hesketh teams.

==Driving career==

Ashley began racing in 1966 when he took a course at the Jim Russell Racing School. He was fast but rather erratic, and soon earned the nickname &quot;Crashley&quot;. He reached Formula 5000 in 1972 and was a front-runner in 1973. He made his debut in Formula One in 1974, and briefly drove for the Williams team the following year. His luck got worse over the mid-1970s in Formula One. He was to become a victim of two nasty accidents on circuits that were no longer used by Formula One soon after his two accidents. During 1975, at the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring where during practice, he crashed severely at the tricky Pflanzgarten section and broke both his ankles, and during practice for the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park in 1977, he went over a bump, flipped his Hesketh, vaulted the barrier and crashed into a television tower. He never raced in Formula One again.

In 1985 he made his CART Championship Car debut at the Miami Grand Prix. He was entered in the 1986 Indianapolis 500 but the car did not appear on track. However, he did make three CART starts in 1986 and finished ninth at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, enough for 28th in the championship. He failed to finish in his other two 1986 starts. He also made a single Indy Lights start at Pocono Raceway and finished sixth. He made one more CART appearance in 1987, again in Miami but was knocked out by drivetrain trouble.

After Formula One he built a career as a pilot for executive jets in the United States. However, in 1993 he made a return to racing, driving a Vauxhall in the British Touring Car Championship. Following this he briefly raced motorcycle sidecar combinations, before a stint in the TVR Tuscan Challenge one-make series.

In November 2009, he competed in Formula Ford for the first time in over 40 years driving an Elden MK8 in the Walter Hayes Trophy at Silverstone.

<text>Ian John Burgess (6 July 1930 – 19 May 2012) was a British racing driver. He participated in 20 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 19 July 1958, and numerous non-Championship Formula One races. He scored no championship points.

==Racing career==
Burgess began racing in 1950 with a Cooper Formula Three car and had a successful 1951 season including a win at the Nürburgring before moving up to sports cars and Formula Two, where he was less successful.

Burgess began working for Cooper, both in their factory and at their drivers&#x27; school based at Brands Hatch and raced one of the works Formula Two cars in 1957, when he achieved fourth place in the Oulton Park Gold Cup. This led to a drive with Tommy Atkins&#x27; team in 1958, with a similar machine. He won at Crystal Palace and Snetterton and gained fourth places at Reims and Montlhéry. However, a broken leg at AVUS ended his season but not before he made his Formula One debut for Cooper at the British Grand Prix.

Burgess returned in 1959 driving Scuderia Centro Sud&#x27;s Cooper T51-Maserati with a best finish of sixth in the German Grand Prix. He continued with the team in 1960 with little success.

For 1961 he joined the American Camoradi International team, competing in five Grands Prix (three starts) with a best finish of 12th in the German Grand Prix. He moved to the Anglo American Equipe team in 1962 competing in three Grands Prix, finishing no higher than 11th. 1963 was his last year in racing and he competed in two Grands Prix for the Scirocco-Powell team, retiring from both.

Burgess died in Harrow, aged 81.

<text>Ian Scheckter (born 22 August 1947) is a South African former racing driver. He participated in 20 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 30 March 1974. He scored no championship points.

==Biography==
The elder brother of 1979 Formula One champion Jody Scheckter and uncle of IRL racer Tomas Scheckter, his first F1 races were in the South African Grand Prix, first driving a Lotus 72 for locals Team Gunston in 1974. The following year and also in 1976, he drove a Tyrrell 007 for Lexington Racing, either side of a couple of European outings for Williams.

In domestic racing, Scheckter came close to ending the run of Dave Charlton of titles in the South African National Drivers Championship in 1975, but in his two spells as a full-time competitor dominated the championship winning 49 races and equalling John Love and Charlton&#x27;s tally of 6 championships.

Securing enough funds for a full season with the March works F1 team in 1977, he turned in some poor performances, aided in great part by the fact that, in some races, Team March had up to five drivers signed; lacking resources to provide adequately for them all. This situation spelled the end of his F1 career. Scheckter&#x27;s final grand prix would have been the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix but he was detained and then expelled from Japan due to only having a tourist visa in his South African passport and Japanese objections to the South African apartheid regime.

<text>Ian Macpherson McCallum Stewart (15 July 1929 – 19 March 2017) was a British racing driver from Scotland.

Stewart was regarded by Jim Clark as a highly-strung individual who &quot;at the wheel was as relaxed as anyone&quot;. His only appearance in a World Championship Grand Prix came at the 1953 RAC British Grand Prix, in which – due to ignition failure – he failed to finish in his Ecurie Ecosse-entered Connaught-Lea Francis A. Stewart&#x27;s main competition was as part of the Jaguar racing Ecurie Ecosse team.

Stewart made a name for himself racing a Jaguar XK120 in British national events, winning 23 races in just three seasons, including the Jersey International and the Wakefield Trophy. He was a founder member of Ecurie Ecosse who adopted the colour he had resprayed his XK120 as their team colour, he was also responsible for their distinctive badge. During this period, he was one of three Ecurie Ecosse drivers for the team&#x27;s debut race at Charterhall, which resulted in a second place for Stewart. It was with the Merchiston team that Stewart won most of his races. This success led to some works outings for the Jaguar marque at Le Mans.

It is often said that during the 1954 Les 24 Heures du Mans he rolled an Aston Martin DB3S on the fast stretch between Arnage and White House corners; that however was Jimmy Stewart, Jackie&#x27;s older brother. Ian had already retired from racing following a crash in the 1954 Argentinian 1000k sports car race to tend to his family&#x27;s agricultural and public house businesses in Perth and Kinross.

<text>Ingo Ott Hoffmann (born 28 February 1953) is a Brazilian retired racing driver from São Paulo. He is most well known for winning the Brazilian Stock Car Championship 12 times (1980, 1985, 1989–1994, 1996–1998 and 2002). He also participated in six Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 25 January 1976. He scored no championship points.

==History==

===Early career===
Hoffman began his career in Brazil competing in Formula Vee and saloon cars. He came to England in 1975 and competed in Formula Three in a March, before moving into Formula One in 1976.

===Formula One years===
Hoffmann&#x27;s Formula One career was hindered by the financial problems of the Fittipaldi team, and he drove the team&#x27;s second car when realistically the team could only afford to run one. This meant Hoffmann only entered certain selected races, and ultimately the second car was dropped altogether. He entered four Grands Prix in 1976, did not qualify for three of them and an eleventh place at Interlagos was the best result achieved. In 1977, Hoffman competed at Buenos Aires (retired, engine) and again at Interlagos where he finished seventh, two laps behind the winner. However, that was Hoffman&#x27;s last race in Formula One, as the second Fittipaldi entry was withdrawn.

===After Formula One===

With the end of his Formula One career, Hoffmann competed in Formula 2 for Project Four with a Ralt and a March in 1977 and 1978, (which was his last year in Europe). He also competed in sports cars and saloon cars both in Europe and in South America.
Notably, Ingo Hoffmann has won the Brazilian Stock Car Championship 12 times (1980, 1985, 1989-1994, 1996-1998 and 2002). In 2006 December, he took his 100th win (of the races in the Brazilian circuits) at the Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet de Brasília, final race of the 2006 season.

<text>Ivor Léon John Bueb (; 6 June 1923 – 1 August 1959) was a British professional sports car racing and Formula One driver from England.

==Career==
Born in East Ham, Essex east of London, Bueb started racing seriously in a Formula Three 500cc Cooper in 1953, graduating to the Cooper works team in 1955 when he finished second in the British championship. He made occasional starts in Grands Prix in 1957 with a Connaught and a Maserati run by Gilby Engineering. The following year he raced Bernie Ecclestone&#x27;s Connaught at Monaco, and drove a Formula Two Lotus at the German Grand Prix.

In 1959 he had two outings for BRP, firstly a non-qualification at Monaco, then another Formula Two entry at the British Grand Prix. He participated in six Formula One World Championship Grands Prix in all, but scored no championship points. He also participated in numerous non-Championship Formula One races. With the death of Archie Scott Brown at Spa in May 1958, Brian Lister hired Bueb to fill the now-vacant Lister-Jaguar driver&#x27;s seat. Bueb did an admirable job, scoring several first places at tracks such as Crystal Palace and Goodwood during the 1958 and 1959 sports car campaigns.

Bueb is perhaps best known for sharing the winning works Jaguar D-type with Mike Hawthorn in the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans which was marred by an accident in which 82 spectators were killed; a success he repeated with Ron Flockhart in the ex-works Ecurie Ecosse car in 1957.

He suffered serious injuries in 1959 when he crashed his BRP Cooper-Borgward Formula Two car at the Charade Circuit near Clermont-Ferrand, France. He crashed at Gravenoire, a multiple apex-section at the very far end of the circuit, and was thrown out of his Cooper. After being carried off the circuit by Gendarmes in a way that probably worsened his injuries, Bueb died six days later at a hospital near the circuit.

It was Ivor Bueb&#x27;s death, in conjunction with Archie Scott Brown&#x27;s demise, that finally led Brian Lister to shut down his very successful sports car racing effort.

<text>Jacques Swaters (; 30 October 1926 – 10 December 2010) was a racing driver from Belgium and former team owner of Ecurie Belgique, Ecurie Francorchamps, and Ecurie Nationale Belge.

==Racing career==

Swaters made his debut in the 24 Hours of Spa in an MG co-driven by his friend and racer-turned-journalist Paul Frère, entered under the Ecurie Francorchamps banner. In 1950 Swaters, Frère and André Pilette established Ecurie Belgique, a banner in which they prepared cars for themselves and other Belgian races, both in Grand Prix and sports car racing. Swaters himself raced a yellow Talbot-Lago in several events, including two World Championship rounds, the 1951 German and Italian Grands Prix.

However, in 1952, Swaters, another Belgian Charles de Tornaco and British driver Geoff Richardson, restarted Ecurie Francorchamps, a racing stable mainly associated with Ferrari. Swaters drove the team Ferrari 500 in a small number of events, but did manage to take a victory at the 1953 Avusrennen, a Formula 2 race. Richardson was signed to drive the prototype Zethrin Rennsport. As a driver, Swaters later concentrated on sports car racing, driving a Jaguar C-Type and a D-Type.

==Team manager==

After retiring from racing in 1957, Swaters became manager of the Ecurie Nationale Belge, which had been formed in 1955 as a merger of his Francorchamps, Frère&#x27;s Ecurie Belgique and Johnny Claes&#x27; Ecurie Belge. The ENB entered several Cooper-Climax cars in Formula 2 racing for both experienced and upcoming Belgian drivers, and helped launch the career of Olivier Gendebien, Lucien Bianchi and Mauro Bianchi. The team moved into F1 in 1960 and later reworked the Emeryson into the ENB chassis.

However, by 1964 Swaters was no longer interested in ENB and had turned his attention to sports car racing completely. Swaters&#x27; Ecurie Francorchamps, which had remained independent from the ENB effort during the 1950s and 1960s, was always a top contender, with occasional class wins (including the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans) and frequent class podiums. An overall victory at the 1965 500km Spa was Swaters&#x27; crowning achievement as a manager.

The Ecurie Francorchamps stopped operating in 1982, but Swaters retained his Garage Francorchamps, a Ferrari dealership.

==Ferrari dealer and collector==
Swaters, who had bought a Ferrari 500 Formula 2 car in 1952 for his racing team, was contacted in 1953 by Ferrari to resolve a problem with the local customs authority for the car they were to display at the Brussels Motor Show and was asked to take care of the Ferrari exhibition stand as well. He managed to get the car through customs as well as making a sale at the Motor Show. As a result, he was appointed as the official Ferrari importer for the Benelux the same year. This was the beginning of a relationship that was to last over 50 years and make Swaters one of the most important Ferrari dealers as well as a major collector of everything related to the brand.

In recognition of their long standing relationship, Ferrari unveiled the Ferrari 456 to the world at the Garage Francorchamps in 1992. At the same time the &quot;Blue Swaters&quot; was introduced by Ferrari as a colour to celebrate 40 years of partnership Ferrari-Swaters.

During his lifetime Jacques Swaters collected everything about Ferrari, original documentations, important vintage cars, sculptures, and other automobilia. With all these items he opened &quot;the bunker&quot; as he would call the Galleria Ferrari, an impressive collection in which feature a lot of gifts given personally by Enzo Ferrari, for example 1 of only 3 bronze crucifix crafted at Ferrari&#x27;s foundery, on the occasion of the pope&#x27;s visit to the Maranello factory, as well as a wooden sculpture of the Prancing Horse, that used to decorate Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s personal office at Ferrari&#x27;s Fiorano circuit. The collection also houses the only Ferrari four-door ever made, the &quot;Pinin&quot; prototype, the Ferrari GTO Evoluzione, a Ferrari California and other rare and important cars of the Italian brand.

Swaters last appearance in the sports car world was in an Ohio Courtroom where he was defending his possession of a very rare 1954 Ferrari 375 plus chassis 0384AM that was stolen from the U.S. collector Karl Kleve in the late 1980s. Swaters said that he rightfully bought the car as a burnt out chassis in 1990, and that he and Kleve settled its ownership in 1999.

In 2008 an aged Jacques Swaters decided to sell a large part of his impressive collection, at an auction in Maranello.

<text>A betting strategy (also known as betting system) is a structured approach to gambling, in the attempt to produce a profit. To be successful, the system must change the house edge into a player advantage — which is impossible for pure games of probability with fixed odds, akin to a perpetual motion machine. Betting systems are often predicated on statistical analysis.

Mathematically, no betting system can alter long-term expected results in a game with random, independent trials, although they can make for higher odds of short-term winning at the cost of increased risk, and are an enjoyable gambling experience for some people. Strategies which take into account the changing odds that exist in some games (e.g. card counting and handicapping), can alter long-term results.

This is formally stated by game theorist Richard Arnold Epstein in &quot;The Theory of Gambling and Statistical Logic&quot; as:

==Examples==
Common betting systems include:
* Card games – Card counting
* Sports – Handicapping
* Martingale
* Kelly criterion
* Split martingale
* Anti-martingale
* d&#x27;Alembert system
* Oscar&#x27;s grind

===Horse racing===
Some horse racing betting systems can be based on pure statistical analysis of the odds, while others also analyze physical factors (e.g. the horses&#x27; form, jockey form and lane draw). Common forms of betting systems for horse racing are:
* hedging - betting on multiple outcomes in a race
* arbitrage - lay the horse a low price and back it at a high price.

<doc id="1233875" wikidata="Q4356352" url="?curid=1233875" title="Health of Adolf Hitler">
<text>The health of [[Adolf Hitler]], dictator of Germany from 1933 to 1945, has long been a subject of popular controversy. Both his physical and mental health have come under scrutiny.

During his younger days, Hitler&#x27;s health was generally good, despite his lack of exercise and a poor diet, which he later replaced with a mostly vegetarian one. Even then, Hitler had a very strong sweet tooth, and would often eat multiple cream cakes at a sitting. Later, as the tension and pressure of being the &quot;Führer&quot; of Germany began to take its toll, Hitler&#x27;s health took a downturn from which he never really recovered. Exacerbated by the many drugs and potions he was given by his unconventional doctor, Theodor Morell, and undermined by Hitler&#x27;s own hypochondria, his premonition of a short lifespan, and his fear of cancer (which killed his mother), the dictator&#x27;s health declined almost continuously until his death by suicide in 1945.

By the time of his last public appearance, 10 days before his death, April 20 1945, in the garden of the New Reich Chancellery building, where he reviewed and congratulated teenaged &quot;Volkssturm&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Storm&quot;) and Hitler Youth soldiers for their efforts in the Battle of Berlin against the Soviet Red Army, Hitler was bent over, shuffled when he walked, and could not stop his left arm, which he held behind him, from trembling. His eyes were glassy, his skin was greasy, and his speech could sometimes barely be heard. He looked to be much older than his actual age, which was 56, and hardly resembled the charismatic orator who had led the Nazi Party to power.

==Trauma==
===First World War===
Hitler&#x27;s mustard gas claim has been disputed by many historians. Supposedly, during World War I, Hitler served as a dispatch runner for the List Regiment of the Bavarian Army. On the night of 13–14 October 1918, he and his comrades were victims of an Allied mustard gas attack near Ypres, Belgium. They had been leaving their dug-out to retreat when the attack occurred, and were partially blinded by it. Hitler received initial treatment in Flanders, and on 21 October was sent to the military hospital in Pasewalk near Stettin in Pomerania. It is believed that instead of being treated for a gas attack, Hitler was being treated for syphilis. It was there that Hitler learned that Germany had asked the Allies for an armistice. He also learned that revolution was in the air. Hitler later claimed that it was while recuperating at Pasewalk that he became a virulent antisemite, although historians consider this to be unlikely, especially when Hitler referred to his conversion in terms of a vision he received. He left the hospital on 19 November, eight days after the armistice was signed.

===1944 assassination attempt===
As a result of the 20 July 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler – in which he survived a bomb explosion at his Wolf&#x27;s Lair headquarters – both of his eardrums were punctured, and he had numerous superficial wounds, including blisters, burns, and 200 wood splinters on his hands and legs, cuts on his forehead, abrasions and swelling on his left arm, and a right arm that was swollen, painful, and difficult to raise, causing him to use his left hand to greet Benito Mussolini, who arrived that day for a previously scheduled summit meeting. The punctured eardrums were the most serious of these injuries. Weeks later, blood was still seeping through Hitler&#x27;s bandages, and he suffered sharp pain in the right ear, as well as hearing loss. The eardrums took several weeks to heal, during which Hitler suffered from dizziness and a loss of balance which made him awkwardly hew to the right when walking. In addition, his blood pressure was high. One unusual result was that the trembling in Hitler&#x27;s hands and left leg, which had increasingly afflicted him for sometime, abated for a time after the explosion, which Morell attributed to nervous shock; they returned in mid-September.

==Syphilis==
Hitler&#x27;s tremor and irregular heartbeat during the last years of his life could have been symptoms of tertiary (late stage) syphilis, which would mean he had had a syphilis infection for many years. However, syphilis had become curable in 1910 with Dr. Paul Ehrlich&#x27;s introduction of the drug Salvarsan.

In &quot;The Man with the Miraculous Hands&quot;, his biography of Dr. Felix Kersten, journalist Joseph Kessel wrote that in the winter of 1942, Kersten heard of Hitler&#x27;s medical condition. Consulted by his patient, Heinrich Himmler, as to whether he could &quot;assist a man who suffers from severe headaches, dizziness and insomnia&quot;, Kersten was shown a top-secret 26-page report. It detailed how Hitler had contracted syphilis in his youth and was treated for it at a hospital in Pasewalk. However, in 1937, symptoms re-appeared, showing that the disease was still active, and by the start of 1942, signs were evident that progressive syphilitic paralysis (&quot;tabes dorsalis&quot;) was occurring. Himmler advised Kersten that Theodor Morell (who in the 1930s claimed to be a venereologist) was in charge of Hitler&#x27;s treatment and that it was a state secret. The book also relates how Kersten learned from Himmler&#x27;s secretary, Rudolf Brandt, that at that time, probably the only other people privy to the report&#x27;s information were Nazi Party chairman Martin Bormann and Hermann Göring, the head of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Interestingly, Morrell was trained as a general practitioner physician. However his specialty was neither dermatology nor venereology but in fact obstetrics and gynaecology. Despite his lack of training, Morrell did treat Hitler [who had an obsessive fear of VD] with Arsenobenzol, designated &quot;606,&quot; Salvarsan, Neosalvarsan with bismuth, and iodine salts.

==Monorchism==

It has been alleged that Hitler had monorchism, the medical condition of having only one testicle. In 2008, a British newspaper reported that in 1916, a German doctor named Johan Jambor had encountered an injured Hitler during the Battle of the Somme. Jambor allegedly asserted that Hitler—who is known to have suffered a groin injury in the battle—had in fact lost a testicle. Jambor had supposedly described the dictator&#x27;s condition to a priest, who later wrote down what he had been told.

Soviet doctor Lev Bezymensky, allegedly involved in the Soviet autopsy, stated in a 1967 book that Hitler&#x27;s left testicle was missing. Bezymensky later admitted that the claim was falsified.

Hitler was routinely examined by many doctors throughout his childhood, military service, and later political career, and no clinical mention of any such condition has ever been discovered. Eduard Bloch, Hitler&#x27;s childhood doctor, told U.S. interrogators in 1943 that Hitler&#x27;s genitals were in fact &quot;completely normal&quot;.

==Huntington&#x27;s disease==
It has been speculated that Hitler had Huntington&#x27;s disease. When many of the physical symptoms shown in newsreels during his later life – his hand tremor and shuffling gait – are coupled with his alleged mental and psychological deterioration, they may also point toward Huntington&#x27;s. This is only conjecture, since a definitive diagnosis would require DNA testing. Although Huntington&#x27;s disease was known and considered a hereditary disease during the time period, even appearing in state papers on the sterilisation list, it is not known if Hitler knew of this condition.

==Parkinson&#x27;s disease==
It has been speculated Hitler had Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Newsreels of Hitler show he had tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk (also a symptom of tertiary syphilis, see above) which began before the war and continued to worsen until the end of his life. Morell treated Hitler with a drug agent that was commonly used in 1945, although Morell is viewed as an incompetent doctor by most historians and any diagnoses he may have made are subject to doubt.

Dr. Werner Haase, Hitler&#x27;s personal physician, who was in attendance every day from 21 April until Hitler&#x27;s suicide on 30 April, was convinced that Hitler had Parkinson&#x27;s. In addition, Dr. Ernst-Günther Schenck, who worked at an emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery during April 1945, also claimed Hitler might have Parkinson&#x27;s disease. However, Schenck only saw Hitler briefly on two occasions and, by his own admission, was extremely exhausted and dazed during these meetings; at the time, he had been in surgery for numerous days without much sleep.

==Other complaints==
From the 1930s onwards, Hitler suffered from stomach pains. In 1936 a non-cancerous polyp was removed from his throat. Hitler also developed eczema on his legs. Some doctors dismiss Hitler&#x27;s ailments as hypochondria, pointing out the apparently drastic decline of Hitler&#x27;s health as Germany began losing World War II. According to a medical examination from 1924, Hitler was 160cm (5ft 3in) tall and weighed , making him slightly overweight.

There is speculation that Hitler may have had Encephalitis lethargica when he was a young adult (in addition to the more substantial case for Parkinsonism in his later years).

In 1943, author Frederick Cable Oechsner claimed in his book &quot;This Is The Enemy&quot; that Hitler had a rhinoplasty in Munich sometime after 1933 to correct the shape of his nose, as it was reportedly &quot;a little bulbous at the end and fatty on the bridge.&quot;

==Mental health==

As debated as Hitler&#x27;s physical medical issues may be, his mental health is a minefield of theories and speculation. This topic is controversial, as many believe that if a psychological cause can be found for Hitler&#x27;s behaviour, there would be more reasoning behind his actions.

In 1993, an interdisciplinary team consisting of Desmond Henry, Dick Geary, and Peter Tyrer published an essay in which they expressed their common view that Hitler had antisocial personality disorder as defined in ICD-10. Tyrer, a psychiatrist, was convinced that Hitler furthermore showed signs of paranoia and of histrionic personality disorder. Robert G. L. Waite, who wrote an extensive psychohistory of Hitler, concluded that he suffered from borderline personality disorder, which manifested its symptoms in numerous ways and would imply Hitler was in full control of himself and his actions. Others have proposed Hitler may have been schizophrenic, based on claims that he was hallucinating and delusional during his last year of life. Many people believe that Hitler had a mental disorder and was not schizophrenic nor bipolar, but rather met the criteria for both disorders, and was therefore most likely a schizoaffective. If true, this might be explained by a series of brief reactive psychoses in a narcissistic personality which could not withstand being confronted with reality (in this case, that he was not the &quot;superman&quot; or &quot;saviour of Germany&quot; he envisioned himself to be, as his plans and apparent early achievements collapsed about him). In addition, his regular methamphetamine use and possible sleep deprivation in the last period of his life must be factored into any speculation as to the cause of his possible psychotic symptoms, as these two activities are known to trigger psychotic reactions in some individuals. Hitler never visited a psychiatrist, and under current methodology, any such diagnosis is speculation.

==Drug use==

Prescribed 90 medications during the war years by Morell, Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments. He regularly consumed methamphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine, as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter in the form of Doktor Koster&#x27;s Antigaspills).

==Criticism of using Hitler&#x27;s health to explain Nazism==
In a 1980 article, German historian Hans-Ulrich Wehler was highly dismissive of all theories that sought to attribute the rise and policies of Nazi Germany to some defect, medical or otherwise, of Hitler&#x27;s. In Wehler&#x27;s opinion, besides the problem that such theories about Hitler&#x27;s medical condition were extremely difficult to prove, the problem was that they had the effect of personalising the phenomena of Nazi Germany by more or less attributing everything that happened in the Third Reich to one flawed individual. Wehler wrote:
Echoing Wehler&#x27;s views, British historian Ian Kershaw argued that it was better to take a broader view of German history by seeking to examine what social forces led to the Third Reich and its policies, as opposed to the &quot;personalised&quot; explanations for the Holocaust and World War II.

In his book &quot;Explaining Hitler: The Search for the Origins of His Evil&quot; (1998), American journalist Ron Rosenbaum sarcastically remarked that theories concerning Hitler&#x27;s mental state and sexual activity shed more light on the theorists and their culture than on Hitler.

==Inbreeding as a possible factor==
It has been theorised that Hitler&#x27;s physical and mental health problems were the result of Hitler having been significantly inbred, possibly having monorchism, with his father Alois Hitler possibly being his mother&#x27;s second cousin. Inbred people have a higher chance of having developmental disorders and harmful mutations. There are however no mentions based on clinical exams of such a diagnosis (see Monorchism section above).

<text>The Vit (; ) is a river in northern Bulgaria, a right tributary of the Danube. Its length including the main stem Beli (White) Vit is 189 km, while the river proper, formed by the confluence of the Beli and Cherni (Black) Vit is 153 km. Vit Ice Piedmont in Antarctica is named after the river. The fish species Vit sculpin of the genus &quot;Cottus&quot; is endemic to the Vit.

== Geography ==
=== Course ===

The main stem the Beli Vit is 36 km long and takes its source at an altitude of 1,595 m on the western foothills of the summit of Yumruka (1,819 m) at the boundary between the Zlatitsa–Teteven and the Troyan sections of the Balkan Mountains and flows in general direction northwest in a steep forested valley. The other stem, the 27 km long Cherni Vit, springs at an altitude of 1,980 m about 800 m northwest of the summit of Baba (2,070 m) in the Zlatitsa–Teteven section of the Balkan Mountains and flows north in a deep forested valley. Both upper reaches of the Vit fall within the Central Balkan National Park.

The river proper forms by the confluence of the Beli Vit (right branch) and the Cherni Vit (left branch) at an altitude of 367 m in the town of Teteven. It flows north in a deep forested valley between the Vasilyovska Mountain to the east and the Lisets Mountain to the west, both part of the fore-Balkan chain that runs parallel to and north of the Balkan Mountains. After the village of Glozhene part of its waters penetrate into karst fissures and feed the largest karst spring in Bulgaria Glava Panega, which is the source of the river Zlatna Panega of the neighbouring Iskar drainage further west. The Vit then turns northeast and follows that general direction until its mouth. Between the villages of Toros and Dermantsi its valley widens and until the village of Sadovets canyon-like ravines alternate with valley expansions. Downstream of Sadovets the Vit enters the Danubian Plain in a wide and asymmetrical valley, with steeper right slopes. It flows into the Danube at an altitude of 22 m some 1.6 km northwest of the village of Dolni Vit. From the village of Gradina to the mouth, the river bed is corrected with water protection dikes. 

=== Basin and hydrology ===

The Vit drainage basin covers a territory of 3,225 km2 or 0.4% of the Danube&#x27;s total and borders the basins of the Iskar to the west and northwest and the Osam to the east, both of the Danube drainage, as well as the Maritsa basin to the south of the Balkan Mountain&#x27;s main water divide. Its main tributaries are the Kalnik (41 km), the Kamenitsa (49 km), the Chernyalka (27 km) and the Tuchenitsa (35 km), all of them right.

The Vit has a mixed feed of snow, rain and karst waters. The importance of the snow feed increases from the north to the south, from the Danubian Plain, via the fore-Balkan to the Balkans Mountains. Underground water feed are prevalent in the fore-Balkan due to the abundance of karst springs. High water is in April–June due to the snowmelt in the mountains, leading at times to floods; low water is in August–November. The average annual discharge is 5.3 m3/s at Teteven, 14.3 m3/s at Sadovets and 14 m3/s at Yasen. The discharge of the Cherni Vit is 3.2 m3/s.

== Fauna ==
A total of 45 fish species have been recorded from the Vit, of them 42 are autochthonous. A 2007–2008 study identified 35 species and estimated that nine of the ten that were not caught during the surveys were likely occurring it the river. The predominating family by number of species is Cyprinidae. The fish found in the Vit include river trout, northern pike, common roach, European chub, ide, asp, common rudd, common bleak, riffle minnow, white bream, common bream, white-eye bream, blue bream, vimba bream, common nase, European bitterling, gudgeon, Kessler&#x27;s gudgeon, Danube whitefin gudgeon, Danubian longbarbel gudgeon, common barbel, Romanian barbel, Prussian carp, crucian carp, common carp, stone loach, European weatherfish, spined loach, Balkan loach, Balkan golden loach, Bulgarian golden loach, wels catfish, European perch, zander, Eurasian ruffe, striped ruffe, Balon&#x27;s ruffe, Danube streber, zingel, monkey goby and European bullhead. The Vit sculpin is a species endemic to the upper reaches of the river and specifically Beli Vit. Twenty five of the recorded fish species are of conservation importance.

== Settlements and economy ==

The river flows in Lovech and Pleven Provinces. There are 19 settlement along its course, including 16 villages and three towns. In Lovech province are Teteven (town) and Glozhene in Teteven Municipality, and Toros, Dermantsi and Aglen in Lukovit Municipality. In Pleven Province are located Sadovets, Krushovitsa and Gradina in Dolni Dabnik Municipality, Tarnene, Disevitsa, Yasen and Opanets in Pleven Municipality, Dolna Mitropoliya (town), Bivolare, Bozhuritsa, Riben and Komarevo in Dolna Mitropoliya Municipality, and Kreta and Gulyantsi (town) in Gulyantsi Municipality. Its waters, especially in the lower course in the Danubian Plain, are utilized for irrigation. Part of them are also diverted for industrial needs, as well as limited electricity generation at the small Lisets Hydro Power Plant. The green Cherni Vit cheese is only produced in the homonymous village in the upper reaches of the Vit.

Along the entire length of the river valley apart from the final three kilometers at the mouth and the uppermost section of the Beli Vit pass roads of the national network, including a 33 km stretch of the third class III-358 road between the confluence with the Debelshtitsa and Glozhene, and the entire 61 km length of the third class III-305 road and 27 km length of the third class III-118 road. Near the village of Toros the river is crossed by the Hemus motorway.

<text>These railroads were bought, leased, or in other ways had their track come under ownership or lease by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.

In 1902, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad gained a majority of stock in the L&amp;N, but it continued to operate as a separate company until its merger in 1982 into the Seaboard System Railroad.

The Georgia Railroad and the West Point Route were partly owned by the L&amp;N.

<doc id="1233907" wikidata="Q284236" url="?curid=1233907" title="Udev">
<text>udev (userspace ) is a device manager for the Linux kernel. As the successor of devfsd and hotplug, udev primarily manages device nodes in the directory. At the same time, udev also handles all user space events raised when hardware devices are added into the system or removed from it, including firmware loading as required by certain devices.

==Rationale==
It is an operating system&#x27;s kernel that is responsible for providing an abstract interface of the hardware to the rest of the software. Being a monolithic kernel, the Linux kernel does exactly that: device drivers are part of the Linux kernel, and make up more than half of its source code. Hardware can be accessed through system calls or over their device nodes.

To be able to deal with peripheral devices that are hotplug-capable in a user-friendly way, a part of handling all of these hotplug-capable hardware devices was handed over from the kernel to a daemon running in user-space. Running in user space serves security and stability purposes.

==Design==
Device drivers are part of the Linux kernel, in which their primary functions include device discovery, detecting device state changes, and similar low-level hardware functions. After loading a device driver into memory from the kernel, detected events are sent out to the userspace daemon udevd. It is the device manager, , that catches all of these events and then decides what shall happen next. For this, has a very comprehensive set of configuration files, which can all be adjusted by the computer administrator, according to their needs.

* In case a new storage device is connected over USB, is notified by the kernel and itself notifies the udisksd-daemon. That daemon could then mount the file systems.
* In case a new Ethernet cable is plugged into the Ethernet NIC, is notified by the kernel and itself notifies the NetworkManager-daemon. The NetworkManager-daemon could start dhclient for that NIC, or configure according to some manual configuration.

The complexity of doing so forced application authors to re-implement hardware support logic. Some hardware devices also required privileged helper programs to prepare them for use. These often have to be invoked in ways that could be awkward to express with the Unix permissions model (for example, allowing users to join wireless networks only if they are logged into the video console). Application authors resorted to using setuid binaries or run service daemons to provide their own access control and privilege separation, potentially introducing security holes each time.

HAL was created to deal with these challenges, but is now deprecated in most Linux distributions, its functionality being replaced by udevd.

==Overview==
Unlike traditional Unix systems, where the device nodes in the directory have been a static set of files, the Linux udev device manager dynamically provides only the nodes for the devices actually present on a system. Although devfs used to provide similar functionality, Greg Kroah-Hartman cited a number of reasons for preferring udev over devfs:
* udev supports persistent device naming, which does not depend on, for example, the order in which the devices are plugged into the system. The default udev setup provides persistent names for storage devices. Any hard disk is recognized by its unique filesystem id, the name of the disk and the physical location on the hardware it is connected to.
* udev executes entirely in user space, as opposed to devfs&#x27;s kernel space. One consequence is that udev moved the naming policy out of the kernel and can run arbitrary programs to compose a name for the device from the device&#x27;s properties, before the node is created; there, the whole process is also interruptible and it runs with a lower priority.

The udev, as a whole, is divided into three parts:
* Library &quot;libudev&quot; that allows access to device information; it was incorporated into the systemd 183 software bundle.
* User space daemon that manages the virtual .
* Administrative command-line utility for diagnostics.

The system gets calls from the kernel via netlink socket. Earlier versions used hotplug, adding a link to themselves in with this purpose.

==Operation==
udev is a generic device manager running as a daemon on a Linux system and listening (via a netlink socket) to uevents the kernel sends out if a new device is initialized or a device is removed from the system. The udev package comes with an extensive set of rules that match against exported values of the event and properties of the discovered device. A matching rule will possibly name and create a device node and run configured programs to set up and configure the device.

udev rules can match on properties like the kernel subsystem, the kernel device name, the physical location of the device, or properties like the device&#x27;s serial number. Rules can also request information from external programs to name a device or specify a custom name that will always be the same, regardless of the order devices are discovered by the system.

In the past a common way to use udev on Linux systems was to let it send events through a socket to HAL, which would perform further device-specific actions. For example, HAL would notify other software running on the system that the new hardware had arrived by issuing a broadcast message on the D-Bus IPC system to all interested processes. In this way, desktops such as GNOME or K Desktop Environment 3 could start the file browser to browse the file systems of newly attached USB flash drives and SD cards.

By the middle of 2011 HAL had been deprecated by most Linux distributions as well as by the KDE, GNOME and Xfce desktop environments, among others. The functionality previously embodied in HAL has been integrated into udev itself, or moved to separate software such as udisks and upower.

* udev provides low-level access to the linux device tree. Allows programs to enumerate devices and their properties and get notifications when devices come and go.
* dbus is a framework to allow programs to communicate with each other, securely, reliably, and with a high-level object-oriented programming interface.
* udisks (formerly known as DeviceKit-disks) is a daemon that sits on top of libudev and other kernel interfaces and provides a high-level interface to storage devices and is accessible via dbus to applications.
* upower (formerly known as DeviceKit-power) is a daemon that sits on top of libudev and other kernel interfaces and provides a high-level interface to power management and is accessible via dbus to applications.
* NetworkManager is a daemon that sits on top of libudev and other kernel interfaces (and a couple of other daemons) and provides a high-level interface to network configuration and setup and is accessible via dbus to apps.

udev receives messages from the kernel, and passes them on to subsystem daemons such as Network Manager. Applications talk to Network Manager over D-Bus.

:&lt;chem&gt;Kernel -&gt; udev -&gt; Network Manager &lt;=&gt; D-Bus &lt;=&gt; Firefox&lt;/chem&gt;

HAL is obsolete and only used by legacy code. Ubuntu 10.04 shipped without HAL. Initially a new daemon DeviceKit was planned to replace certain aspects of HAL, but in March 2009, DeviceKit was deprecated in favor of adding the same code to udev as a package: udev-extras, and some functions have now moved to udev proper.

==History==
udev was introduced in Linux 2.5. The Linux kernel version 2.6.13 introduced or updated a new version of the uevent interface. A system using a new version of udev will not boot with kernels older than 2.6.13 unless udev is disabled and a traditional directory is used for device access.

In April 2012, udev&#x27;s codebase was merged into the systemd source tree, making systemd 183 the first version to include udev. In October 2012, Linus Torvalds criticized Kay Sievers&#x27;s approach to udev maintenance and bug fixing related to firmware loading, stating:

In 2012, the Gentoo Linux project created a fork of systemd&#x27;s udev codebase in order to avoid dependency on the systemd architecture. The resulting fork is called &quot;eudev&quot; and it makes udev functionality available without systemd. A stated goal of the project is to keep eudev independent of any Linux distribution or init system. The Gentoo project describes eudev as follows:

On May 29, 2014, support for firmware loading through udev was dropped from systemd, as it has been decided that it is the kernel&#x27;s task to load firmware. Two days later, Lennart Poettering suggested this patch be postponed until kdbus starts to be utilized by udev; at that point, the plan was to switch udev to use kdbus as the underlying messaging system, and to get rid of the userspace-to-userspace netlink-based transport.

==Authors==
udev was developed by Greg Kroah-Hartman and Kay Sievers, with much help from Dan Stekloff, among others.

<text>Fábio Rogério Innecco (born February 14, 1936) is a Brazilian painter, landscaper, researcher and assistant to graphic arts. Innecco was born in the city of Niterói, Rio de Janeiro. Between 1958 and 1963 he took lessons in drawing with Abelardo Zaluar and lessons in painting with Henrique Cavalheiro. At this time he took a course at the National School of Fine Arts at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). His work is cited in the &quot;Brazilian Dictionary of Arts&quot;, published by the Book National Institute of the Education and Culture Ministry (MEC) in the book by Frederico de Moraes: &quot;Chronology of Arts in Rio de Janeiro&quot; (Topbooks publisher) and in the book &quot;&quot;Niterói and its painters&quot; (Exito publisher - Enitur).

Innecco obtained two prizes in the 1960s. One, in 1962, the Esso Painting Prize - Salon of Students, promoted by the students&#x27; union at the National School of Fine Arts and the other, in 1965, awarded by MEC, the Exemption Prize of the Jury at the Salon of Modern Art.

==Works==
Since the early sixties he has taken part in several collective exhibitions, including The Salon in aid of the Spanish exiled (1963), in São Paulo, the Salon of Modern Art (1965), Nine Artists, Embramove Gallery (1983), Six Figurative Artists, Casa Grande Theatre (1985), XVI Salon of the Carioca Art in Rio de Janeiro (1992). In Niterói, he has participated in the Paschoal Carlos Magno Cultural Centre collective exhibitions (1991/1997) and in the Six Artists, at the painter Bernadii&#x27;s studio. Abroad, he participated in two collective exhibitions at the New Visual Gallery, in Frankfurt, Germany in 1993 and 1994.

The artist held individual painting exhibitions at the Olivia Kann Gallery (1987), the Embramove Gallery (1988) and at the Marfebrás (1988) in Rio de Janeiro. In Niterói, he held individual exhibitions at the Sanitária Fluminense Cultural Centre (1988). In 1996 he held a drawing exhibition at the Paschoal Carlos Magno Cultural Centre in Niterói.

His works are part of the private collections of many Brazilian personalities such as Luis Eduardo Guinle, Luis Paulo Conde, Marcelo Conde, Alexandre Baldaque Guimarães, Ruy Baldaque Guimarães and Viviani Soares Sampaio.

<text>Adam Parfrey (April 12, 1957 – May 10, 2018) was an American journalist, editor, and the publisher of Feral House books, whose work in all three capacities frequently centered on unusual, extreme, or &quot;forbidden&quot; topics. A 2010 &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; profile stated that &quot;what Parfrey does is publish books that explore the marginal aspects of culture. And in many cases—at least back when his interests were almost exclusively transgressive—he sheds light on subjects that society prefers to leave unexplored, carving a niche catering to those of us with an unseemly obsession with life&#x27;s darkest, most depraved sides.&quot;

==Early life==
Parfrey was born in New York City, but during childhood moved to Los Angeles with his parents, actor Woodrow Parfrey and Rosa Ellovich, a stage director of Jewish descent. After graduating high school, he attended the University of California, Santa Cruz, and UCLA, before dropping out to move to San Francisco, where he began a short-lived experimental magazine, &quot;IDEA&quot;. That publication folded after two issues. In 1983 he wrote and performed in a play, &quot;The Wickedest Man in the World&quot;, about Gilles de Rais, a 15th-century French serial killer of children.

That year, Parfrey moved east to Hoboken, New Jersey, and began working at New York City&#x27;s Strand Bookstore. In 1984, with Kim Seltzer and Strand co-worker George Petros, Parfrey launched &quot;EXIT&quot; magazine; he collaborated on three of the six published issues before leaving the publication in 1987.

==Career==
===Amok Press===
In 1987, Parfrey and Kenneth Swezey co-founded Amok Press in New York. (Amok Books, an unrelated imprint, was founded by Swezey&#x27;s brother Stuart later that year.) Amok Press&#x27;s first title was an English translation by Joachim Neugroschel of the Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels&#x27;s novel &quot;Michael&quot; (1929), which was reviewed in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;. This was followed by Parfrey&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Culture&quot;, a collection of articles, interviews, and documents that explore various marginal aspects of culture. &quot;Apocalypse Culture&quot; was Parfrey&#x27;s most successful book, selling 100,000 copies by 2010. In total, Amok Press published eight books, including &quot;You Can&#x27;t Win&quot;, by Jack Black, &quot;The Grand Guignol: Theatre of Fear and Terror&quot;, by Mel Gordon, and &quot;Boxcar Bertha: An Autobiography, As Told to Dr. Ben L. Reitman&quot;.

===Feral House===
Parfrey moved back to the west coast and while living in Portland, Oregon, founded another imprint, Feral House, in 1989. The company&#x27;s first book was &quot;The Satanic Witch&quot; by Anton LaVey. Over the years, Feral House published titles by Steven Blush, John Zerzan, John Sinclair, Michael Moynihan, Didrik Søderlind, Ted Kaczynski and others. Parfrey co-wrote many Feral House titles.

In 1998 Parfrey was sued over a book alleging government involvement in the Oklahoma City bombing. As a result of the lawsuit (brought by a former FBI official named in the book), Parfrey had to destroy all remaining copies of the book and issue a statement disavowing its allegations. 

In 2000, &quot;Apocalypse Culture II&quot;, a sequel to the 1987 book, was published.

===Process Media===
In 2005, Parfrey co-founded the publishing company Process Media with Jodi Wille of Dilettante Press.

==Political views==
Parfrey described himself as &quot;a pot-smoking libertarian.&quot; He published authors with a wide range of extremist political views, including fascists and neo-Nazis as well as anarchists, leftists, and liberals. He publicly maintained that he didn&#x27;t necessarily agree with the viewpoints he published, telling one interviewer in 1995, “Everything the establishment extols as comfortable and right and good makes me sick.” In the 1980s he also corresponded with James Mason and other neo-Nazis. In his letters to Mason he expressed racist views, portraying the non-right-wing books that he published as ideological camouflage:

I’m trying to get together a book written by nigger and spic gang members on youth gangs...To me, letting these cocaine-addled nigger murderers prattle on about their miserable lives will be rope enough for them to hang themselves. But then I can always point to the book when the ADL gets on my case about racism, neo-Nazism, etc.
Parfrey frequently pointed to his Jewish ancestry to refute accusations of fascist sympathies.

==Personal life==
Parfrey lived in Los Angeles for a time before moving to Port Townsend, Washington, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Parfrey first heard of Port Townsend through the Loompanics publishing house, which was based there.

He was married and divorced three times, the last time to his creative collaborator Jodi Wille.

He died in Seattle on May 10, 2018, following complications from a series of strokes.

==Legacy==
Vice Magazine called Feral House a forerunner to 4chan and Reddit.

Feral House books inspired the films Ed Wood, American Hardcore, and Lords of Chaos. The conspiracy literature published by Feral House was also an influence on &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

Along with his associates Boyd Rice and Michael Moynihan, Parfrey helped popularize James Mason&#x27;s writings, which found a new audience among neo-Nazis in the 2010s.

<doc id="1233934" wikidata="Q7954042" url="?curid=1233934" title="WOWT">
<text>WOWT (channel 6) is a television station in Omaha, Nebraska, United States, affiliated with NBC and owned by Gray Media. The station&#x27;s studios are located at the Kiewit Plaza on Farnam Street near downtown Omaha, and its transmitter is located on a &quot;tower farm&quot; near North 72nd Street and Crown Point Avenue in north-central Omaha.

WOWT is Gray&#x27;s only Nebraska station that is not part of its Nebraska News &amp; Weather Network which includes sister stations KOLN/KGIN, KSNB-TV, KNEP, and KNOP-TV.

==History==
The station signed on the air on August 29, 1949, at noon as WOW-TV; it was the first television station in Nebraska and is one of the oldest in the Upper Midwest. It also claims to have gone on the air earlier than any station in four other Midwestern states—Iowa, Kansas, North Dakota and South Dakota. The station was owned by Radio Station WOW, Inc., alongside WOW radio (590 AM, now KXSP, and 92.3 FM, now KEZO). The owners operated under a United States Supreme Court ruling which had forced the Woodmen of the World, who had founded WOW in 1923, to divest itself of the radio stations because they threatened the Woodmen&#x27;s tax-exempt status.

The station was originally a primary NBC affiliate and secondary ABC affiliate; it lost ABC programming in 1953, when KFOR-TV signed on from Lincoln as an ABC affiliate. However, in 1954, Lincoln was separated from the Omaha market, and WOW-TV resumed sharing ABC programming with KMTV (channel 3) until 1957, when KETV signed on as an ABC affiliate. Meredith Corporation bought WOW-AM-FM-TV in 1951. The station claims it was bought by former Secretary of the Navy Francis P. Matthews in 1954, but this is false as Matthews had died two years earlier. On January 24, 1955, after the radio stations dropped their longtime affiliation with the NBC Red Network in favor of the CBS Radio Network, WOW-TV became a secondary CBS television affiliate. This was part of CBS&#x27; multi-year, five-station affiliation deal with Meredith Corporation, as a compensation for Phoenix sister station KPHO&#x27;s initial loss of the CBS affiliation to KOOL-TV before it reclaimed that affiliation in 1994 (KCMO-AM-FM-TV also switched to the network several months earlier). On January 1, 1956, WOW-TV officially became Omaha&#x27;s CBS outlet, trading affiliations with KMTV.

WOWT&#x27;s most famous former employee is former &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host Johnny Carson, who worked at WOW-TV in the early 1950s in his first television job as the host of a program called &quot;The Squirrel&#x27;s Nest&quot;, where he told jokes. Another prominent former employee is former ABC &quot;Good Morning America&quot; reporter Steve Bell, who worked for Channel 6 during the early and mid-1960s. He was the only local reporter to go to Dallas in November 1963 to cover the aftermath of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Bell left channel 6 in 1967 to join ABC News, where he remained until 1986.

In 1974, Meredith tried to sell WOW-TV to Pulitzer Publishing Company for $8 million, but the deal collapsed and Pulitzer ended up buying KETV instead.

When Meredith sold channel 6 to the San Francisco-based Chronicle Publishing Company in 1975, it changed its call letters to WOWT on July 9, due to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) restrictions regarding the usage of the same call letters by different owners at the time. Normally, channel 6 would have had to adopt a callsign starting with &quot;K&quot; when it changed its call letters, since the WOW call letters had been assigned before the current K/W dividing line was moved to the Mississippi River. However, Chronicle wanted to continue trading on the WOW calls, and got a waiver from the FCC to retain a &quot;W&quot; in its calls. To this day, WOWT is one of the westernmost stations with a callsign starting with &quot;W&quot;. After negotiations with the network, Channel 6 reversed the 1956 swap and rejoined NBC on June 29, 1986.

Not surprisingly, channel 6 owns a lot of firsts in the market. It was the first Omaha station to broadcast local programming in color, starting in the mid-1950s; it was the first station to provide live reports during its daily newscasts; it was the first of the three local stations to broadcasts three live daily newscasts, at 5, 6, and 10 p.m.; and in 1993, WOWT was the first local television station to offer a website. During the analog era, WOWT-TV was relayed in Clarinda, Iowa, on a UHF repeater, K58AE, which has since been shut down and deleted from the FCC database.

In 1999, Chronicle sold its media holdings (including its newspapers and four television stations) to separate buyers; WOWT was sold to Benedek Broadcasting via LIN TV Corporation in a three-way deal for WWLP in Springfield, Massachusetts. Three years later, Benedek Broadcasting was acquired by Gray Television. In 2021, WOWT reunited with some former sister stations after being separated for 46 years when Gray Television acquired Meredith.

Until 2014, WOWT was considered the default NBC affiliate for Lincoln, the state capital, located from Omaha. Despite Lincoln being in a different market, most Lincoln-area cable systems carried WOWT, and channel 6&#x27;s analog signal decently covered Lincoln. It even went as far as including Lincoln in its legal IDs. When direct broadcast satellite gained more penetration KHAS-TV (now KNHL) in Hastings, which had long served as the NBC affiliate for the western half of the Lincoln market, was offered as the local NBC affiliate. However, most Lincoln cable systems opted to continue carrying WOWT. With the acquisition of KSNB-TV in Superior by Gray, that station took over the primary local NBC affiliation for Lincoln, replacing WOWT on the local Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum) system. Until 2016, WOWT was carried in standard definition on digital channel 83 in Lincoln and surrounding Spectrum systems. However, it is no longer available in the Lincoln area.

On January 7, 2015, Gray Television stations WOWT, WIBW (Topeka, Kansas), and KAKE (Wichita, Kansas; no longer owned by them) were dropped from Cox cable lineups as a retransmission deal expired. The previous agreement expired on December 31, but a one-week extension was agreed upon before the current blackout. After a dispute lasting several days, a new agreement was reached on January 11, 2015, and the three Gray Television stations returned to Cox cable lineups.

===62O===
In October 2005, WOWT launched a second digital subchannel as a UPN affiliate, branded as &quot;UPN Omaha&quot;. The subchannel became an independent station branded as &quot;62O&quot;, when The WB and UPN shut down in September 2006 (former WB affiliate KXVO (channel 15) now carries WB and UPN successor The CW, while Fox affiliate KPTM (channel 42) carries MyNetworkTV on its second digital subchannel). 

After that, 6.2 became affiliated with Universal Sports. However, when Universal Sports transitioned exclusively to cable and satellite distribution, WOWT dropped the network on October 1, 2011, replacing it with a local weather service known as &quot;The Weather Authority Channel&quot;, an affiliate of The Local AccuWeather Channel. KETV (channel 7) dropped The Local AccuWeather Channel in September 2011 to switch its second subchannel to MeTV.

==News operation==
WOWT currently broadcasts 40 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday and hours on both Saturdays and Sundays); in regard to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it has the highest local newscast output of any broadcast television stations in the Omaha market.

In 1991, WOWT rebranded its newscasts from &quot;Action News 6&quot; to &quot;Channel 6 News&quot;. In 1995, WOWT launched a cable news channel called &quot;NEWS on ONE&quot;, which featured live simulcasts and taped rebroadcasts of the station&#x27;s newscasts on Cox Communications channel 1. The channel was eventually rebranded as &quot;News 4 You&quot;, concurrent with its move to Cox channel 4 in 2009. Also in 1995, WOWT&#x27;s sports department launched a weekly half-hour sports news program titled &quot;Channel 6 Sunday Sports Extra&quot;, which aired after the station&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast on Sunday evening. It was the only program of its kind in Omaha, and was hosted from its inception by sports producer (now sports director) Ross Jernstrom. In 2006, WOWT lost its longtime spot in first place in most timeslots to KETV, who remains there as of 2020. In October 2013, the newscasts were rebranded &quot;WOWT 6 News&quot;. On July 16, 2018, WOWT re-added a 4 p.m. newscast on weekdays, competing with KMTV&#x27;s newscast at that time slot. WOWT had been the first Omaha station to have a 4 p.m. newscast, launching it in 1994. Its current moniker is &quot;6 On Your Side&quot;.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WOWT ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 6, on February 17, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television (which Congress had moved the previous month to June 12). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 22, using virtual channel 6. WOWT and PBS member station KYNE (part of the Nebraska Public Media TV network) were the only two stations in the Omaha market to end analog broadcasts on the original deadline.

Upon the switch to digital, WOWT aired a 60-second farewell video bookending the analog era from beginning to end. It began with the words &quot;Welcome to the Future&quot;, followed with archived film footage of WOW-TV&#x27;s transmitter being turned on 1949 as it was covered by then-sister station WOW radio (now KXSP), outdoor scenes set to the song &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, and concluded with the station logo and digital call sign &quot;WOWT-DT Omaha&quot; set to the NBC chimes. Voiceover artist Charlie Van Dyke provided narration: &quot;Sixty years ago, WOWT turned on its analog signal to be the first television station in Omaha. Now, join us for the digital age as we shut off our analog signal and transition to digital television. We look forward to the new journey ahead. This is WOWT, Channel 6.&quot;

As part of the SAFER Act, WOWT kept its analog signal on the air temporarily to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a scrolling message.

<doc id="1233936" wikidata="Q129397251" url="?curid=1233936" title="St Andrews, Bristol">
<text>St Andrew&#x27;s is a suburb of Bristol situated about 3 km (1.8 miles) north of the city centre. The area was developed in the late 19th century as St Andrew&#x27;s Park Estate, and consists mostly of large Victorian villas, with some inter-war housing and some minor rebuilding in Cromwell Road and Belvoir Road following enemy action in World War II.

The area is roughly bounded by the Severn Beach Railway Line, Gloucester Road, Somerville Road and Cromwell Road; however the boundary is debatable: according to the Ordnance Survey map this area is Montpelier, whereas according to the National Gazetteer of 1868, Montpelier is a hamlet within the Parish of St Andrew&#x27;s. St Andrew&#x27;s Church, which gave the area its name, was in St Andrew&#x27;s Road, Montpelier. The church was demolished in 1969.

The David Thomas Memorial church was erected 1879–1881 and demolished in 1987, destroying most of a Gothic fantasy by Stuart Colman. The building still retains a thin octagonal spire and west front but the massive halls, apse and rib vaults have now gone in favour of flats by Stride Treglown.

In the mid 20th century, the area became unfashionable and many of the houses were converted to multiple occupation. However, during the 1990s, the area became fashionable again and consequently many houses are now being converted back into family homes.

St Andrew&#x27;s is well served by public transport, with frequent buses to all parts of the city from Gloucester Road, buses to University of West England&#x27;s Frenchay Campus and a local train service from Montpelier to Bristol Temple Meads, Clifton and Avonmouth on the Severn Beach Line.

== St Andrew&#x27;s Park ==
St Andrew&#x27;s Park is at the heart of the area. The park was laid out in 1895, and is home to events such as &#x27;Music in the Park&#x27; during the summer, and &#x27;Carols in the Park&#x27; at Christmas. The park features a well-sized children&#x27;s play area, permanent paddling pool (serviced and used only in the summer months) and public toilets (limited opening hours). Despite being located on a hilly incline, the park is well used for football and frisbee throughout the year. On 30 April 1941 a Wellington bomber on a night training flight crashed in the park after hitting barrage balloon cables. There is now a memorial to the crash in the park. A website has been created about the crash.

<doc id="1233938" wikidata="Q5942113" url="?curid=1233938" title="Luke Lea (American politician, born 1879)">
<text>Luke Lea (April 12, 1879November 18, 1945) was an American attorney, politician and newspaper publisher. A Democrat, he was most notable for his service as a United States Senator from Tennessee from 1911 to 1917. Lea was the longtime publisher of &quot;The Tennessean&quot; newspaper in Nashville, and a United States Army veteran of World War I. In 1919 he led an unauthorized and unsuccessful attempt to kidnap the recently exiled German Kaiser Wilhelm II.

==Early life==
Lea was the son of John Overton and Ella ( Cocke) Lea. He was born into a political family after Reconstruction and named for a paternal great-grandfather, Luke Lea, who was a two-term Congressman from Tennessee in the 1830s. Initially an ardent supporter of Democrat Andrew Jackson, the elder Lea later became a member of the Whig Party. One of Lea&#x27;s maternal great-grandfathers was William Cocke, who served in the U.S. Senate from Tennessee from 1796 to 1797, and again from 1799 to 1805.

Lea received his early education from tutors at home. He attended University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1899. He received a master&#x27;s degree in 1900. Lea was the manager of the &quot;Iron Men&quot; of the 1899 Sewanee Tigers football team, and was credited with organizing their schedule of games. The Tigers won five road games in six days, and outscored opponents 322 to 10. A documentary film about that team and Luke Lea&#x27;s role was released in 2022 called &quot;Unrivaled: Sewanee 1899&quot;.

He attended Columbia Law School in New York City, from which he graduated in 1903. Lea was admitted to the bar the same year, and began to practice in Nashville.

==Early career==
In addition to practicing law, Lea formed a company to purchase the &quot;Nashville American&quot; newspaper. Reorganized as the &quot;Nashville Tennessean&quot;, Lea served as its first editor and publisher. He later merged the &quot;Tennessean&quot; with the &quot;Nashville Democrat&quot;, and his newspaper was a leading proponent of Prohibition.

One of Lea&#x27;s associates at the &quot;American&quot; and later the &quot;Tennessean&quot; was Edward W. Carmack. Lea became involved in Democratic Party politics as a member of the faction led by Carmack. In 1908, Carmack was shot and killed by Duncan Brown Cooper, a former editor of the &quot;American&quot;, and Cooper&#x27;s son Robin. Carmack wounded Robin Cooper with return fire. The Coopers were part of the Democratic Party faction led by Malcolm R. Patterson, who was elected governor in 1906, and whom Carmack had challenged unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1908. Duncan and Robin Cooper were both convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to prison. Duncan Cooper&#x27;s conviction was affirmed on appeal, after which he received a pardon from Patterson. Robin Cooper won an appeal and the right to a retrial, but no prosecutor was willing to re-try the case, so he went free. Lea assumed leadership of the Carmack faction, which succeeded in persuading Patterson to withdraw from the 1910 campaign.

==United States Senator==

Lea was elected to the Senate by the Tennessee General Assembly in 1911; after 10 unsuccessful ballots, his name was introduced as a compromise choice, and he was selected on the 11th ballot. He was an enthusiastic supporter of most of the progressive policies of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, a fellow native of the South. Elected president in 1912, Wilson was only the second Democrat to gain the office since the end of the Civil War. During the 63rd Congress, Lea was chairman of the Senate Committee on the Library (of Congress).

Socially progressive but fiscally conservative, Lea actively supported lowering tariffs, the creation of the Federal Reserve System, the regulation of major corporations, and the breaking up of trusts. He also supported women&#x27;s suffrage and a national prohibition amendment. He allied with Robert La Follette and supported his seaman&#x27;s act. He approved of the eight-hour day and opposed child labor.

In 1913, Lea began his most ambitious undertaking in the Senate when he attempted to launch a federal investigation of the railroads and political corruption in Tennessee. The investigation encouraged the railroads to cease distributing free passes as political favors, but the growing crisis of the First World War eventually overshadowed concerns about corruption, and the investigation was shelved.

During Lea&#x27;s term, the Seventeenth Amendment changed the method of election of Senators from election by the state legislatures to direct popular vote. Lea supported this measure. Lea contended for the 1916 Democratic nomination for the seat but was defeated by Kenneth McKellar, a colleague of Memphis political &quot;boss&quot; E. H. Crump. McKellar was re-elected to a total of six terms, and is to date Tennessee&#x27;s longest-serving senator. Despite his lame duck status, Lea continued to work on the progressive agenda. He voted to confirm Louis Brandeis to the Supreme Court, and supported a number of progressive measures in the Senate including immigration reform, the Shipping Act of 1916, and the Revenue Act of 1916.

==World War I==
Shortly after the end of Lea&#x27;s Senate term, the U.S. entered World War I. Lea had been opposed to U.S. involvement, but once war was declared, he joined the United States Army and raised a volunteer Field Artillery regiment. Lea&#x27;s regiment was mustered into federal service as the 114th Field Artillery Regiment, a unit of the 39th Division, which Lea commanded as a colonel. The regiment distinguished itself in France, including the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Lea was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his wartime efforts.

===Attempt to kidnap Kaiser Wilhelm II===
In January 1919, Lea and a group of three officers and three sergeants from his unit, the 114th Field Artillery, traveled to Kasteel Amerongen in the Netherlands in a failed attempt to seize the recently exiled German Kaiser Wilhelm II and bring him to the Paris Peace Conference for potential trial for war crimes. One of the officers accompanying Lea was Larry MacPhail.

This attempt was apparently inspired by a chance meeting with the Duke of Connaught in 1918 who had told Lea that he was the uncle of both King George V and the Kaiser and suggested that the European establishment would protect the Kaiser.

The Americans entered the Netherlands using false civilian passports travelling in two staff cars with weapons concealed under the seats. On arriving at the Chateau where the Kaiser was staying, Lea claimed to be the son of the local count. They immediately raised suspicions and the Kaiser unsurprisingly refused to see them. They retreated to their cars, after stealing an inscribed bronze ashtray, and fled the country.

After an investigation of the incident, the Army reprimanded Lea, MacPhail and the others as it was illegal for them to have entered a neutral country.

==Later career==
After the close of the war, Lea returned to Nashville and resumed operation of his newspaper. In 1919 he was one of the founders of the American Legion and served prominently in various leadership roles. In 1929 Governor Henry H. Horton nominated Lea for appointment to the Senate seat vacated by the death of Lawrence D. Tyson. Lea declined, choosing instead to remain active in the banking and real estate businesses. Horton nominated William Emerson Brock, who accepted.

In the 1920s, Lea was a major investor in the Nashville investment banking firm of Caldwell &amp; Company, due in part to his friendship with its founder Rogers Caldwell. When accusations of corruption were subsequently made about the bank, Lea and his associates became the subject of rumor that they too were corrupt.

==Conviction and imprisonment==
Lea was indicted in North Carolina with others, including his eldest son, for bank fraud resulting from the 1930 collapse of the Central Bank and Trust Company of Asheville, North Carolina, a bank with which he had become affiliated through his connection with Caldwell &amp; Company. Both Lea and his son were tried in North Carolina in 1931. L. E. Gwinn, a prominent Memphis attorney whose specialty was criminal law, was brought in along with other attorneys, and the detailed preparation of the North Carolina case was entrusted to him. The Leas were convicted on three of seven counts. Luke was sentenced to six to 10 years in prison.

After the Leas’ appeals were exhausted and after the U.S. Supreme Court denied their petition for a writ of &quot;certiorari&quot;, both Leas reported for imprisonment at Raleigh in May 1934. Lea received a parole in April 1936, and he received a full pardon in June 1937. Through the end of his life, Lea maintained that he and his son were wrongly prosecuted and convicted and that the prosecution was political in nature, with Lea being made the scapegoat for the Central Bank and Trust’s failure by his Republican foes in North Carolina and Tennessee.

==Death and burial==
Lea died on November 18, 1945, at the Vanderbilt University Hospital in Nashville, at the age of 66. He was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.

==Family==
Lea married Mary Louise Warner in 1906. They were the parents of Luke Lea Jr. and Percy Warner Lea. Mary Lea died while Luke Lea was en route to France during World War I. Lea married Percy Warner in 1920; she was the sister of his first wife. Luke and Percy Lea were the parents of Mary Louise, Laura, and Overton.

==Legacy==
They resided at 3700 Whitland Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee. The house, known as Washington Hall, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property to the Whitland Area Neighborhood.

Lea Heights in Nashville&#x27;s Percy Warner Park, a place offering an excellent view of the downtown Nashville skyline, is named in his honor. The original land grant establishing Percy Warner Park was donated by Lea and his family to Nashville. The park is named for Lea&#x27;s father-in-law.

==Representation in other media==
The book &quot;At Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; by Southern writer Robert Penn Warren is said to be a &quot;roman à clef&quot; about the 1920s era and Caldwell &amp; Company in the Nashville area, as are aspects of the novel &quot;A Summons to Memphis&quot; by the novelist Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor. Author David Neil Drews released &quot;Iron Tigers&quot; in 2023--a historical novel inspired by the 1899 Sewanee football team. The novel&#x27;s Alfie Melville is significantly based on Luke Lea--the 1899 Sewanee team&#x27;s manager and mastermind of their epic season.

<text>Abu Anas al-Shami (; died 16 September 2004) was a senior leader in the Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal Jihad militant group during the Iraq War. He was a Palestinian from Tulkarm city in the West Bank, born in Kuwait in 1969.

According to the late ISIS cleric Turki al-Binali, he mentored Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the late spokesperson of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

==History==
Abu Anas Al Shami was a Palestinian cleric, teacher, writer, and jihadist born in Kuwait. It has been said that &quot;from the age of 14, Abu Anas had mastered the complexities of the Arabic language, and a year later memorized the entire Quran.&quot; Originally from the Palestinian West Bank town of Yabroud, Abu Anas obtained an Islamic studies degree at the Islamic University of Madinah in Saudi Arabia.

In the mid-1990s he went to Bosnia-Herzegovina to teach Islam in towns and refugee camps. He then returned to Jordan and became a preacher in the neighborhood of Sweileh. In the late 1990s, the Jordanian officials shut down an Islamic center that al-Shami had established in Amman on the grounds that it was promoting an extreme interpretation of Islam.

==Iraq==
In 2003, al-Shami joined al-Tawheed wal-Jihad leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in north-eastern Iraq. He was appointed to the advisory council of the group and soon became Zarqawi&#x27;s second in command. He was both spiritual advisor to the group and directed many of its attacks and battles against American and Iraqi forces. In a letter he wrote that his 300 &quot;mujaheddin&quot; had fought-off over 2,000 U.S. Marines in the First Battle of Fallujah.

In one tape in August 2004, a speaker identified as Abu Anas al-Shami (second man of Zarqawi and leader of Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad made up mostly by foreigners) said the militants planned to kill Iraqi prime minister Ayad Allawi, soldiers and police officers.

==Death==
Abu Anas al-Shami was killed by an American missile strike against his car on 16 September 2004 near Abu Ghraib, when he had been sent by Zarqawi to the Sadr City area of Baghdad. A eulogy to him was written by Zarqawi&#x27;s first spiritual mentor, Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, and appeared on the Tawhed website which is run by Maqdisi&#x27;s organisation on behalf of al-Qaeda.

<text>An Olympic Park is a sports campus for hosting the Olympic Games. Typically it contains the Olympic Stadium and the International Broadcast Centre. It may also contain the Olympic Village or some of the other sports venues, such as the aquatics complex in the case of the summer games, or the main ice hockey rink for the winter games. The Olympic Park is often part of the &quot;legacy&quot; which provides benefit to the host city after the games have ended. As such it may subsequently include an urban park and a museum or similar commemoration of the games that were hosted there.
The 1908 Olympic organising committee specified &quot;As far as possible all the competitions, including swimming, archery, fencing, wrestling, etc., will be held on the same site in which the amphitheatre for the track-athletics and cycling will be erected.&quot; Not every games has a centralised complex of this type. The 1992 and 2010 Winter Games had widely dispersed venues; &quot;Whistler Olympic Park&quot; was the venue for the nordic skiing events in 2010. Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro were split among four &quot;clusters&quot; rather than concentrated in a single Park.

<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 301 Class locomotives were the first diesel locomotives used on the CIÉ network, this class of 5 being built between 1947 and 1948 by the company for shunting use, particularly in the railway yards on Dublin&#x27;s North Wall. They were a six coupled (0-6-0 wheel arrangement) locomotive, fitted with a Mirrlees TLDT6 engine of with diesel–electric transmission via two Brush traction motors. Unusually, they lacked train vacuum brakes, although air brakes were provided for the locomotive itself.

They were initially numbered 1000-1004 in the steam locomotive number series, but were subsequently renumbered D301-D305 in order. The locomotives were used on yard pilot and transfer freight duties, although number 1000 hauled a freight train from Dublin to Cork during trials. Two locomotives were stored from 1960 and the rest had followed by 1972, though officially they remained in stock until 1976. All five were scrapped in 1977.

== Model ==
The D Class is not available in either RTR or kit form. However, the British Rail Class 08 can be used as a close approximation.

<doc id="1233974" wikidata="Q123904" url="?curid=1233974" title="Jean-Denis Delétraz">
<text>Jean-Denis Delétraz (born 1 October 1963) is a Swiss racing driver. He participated in three Formula One Grands Prix, debuting in the 1994 Australian Grand Prix. Before reaching Formula One, he scored two third places in the 1988 Formula 3000 season, but principally earned his three Formula One drives as a pay driver. After Formula One, he competed in sports car racing, with two class wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Career==

===Pre-Formula One===
Delétraz had some success in his early career, including two wins in Formula Ford cars. He went on to compete in Formula Three between 1985 and 1987 in the French championship, finishing 14th in the final standings in 1987. Between 1988 and 1991, he competed in Formula 3000 and during 1990 he bought the FIRST racing team, but was never able to match the success of 1988 and scored no points. During 1991 the team was impounded by an Italian court for a time after legal action from the team&#x27;s other driver, Giovanni Bonanno.

In 1992 and 1993, Deletraz competed in the French Touring Car Championship and the Porsche Supercup with little success. In 1994, Delétraz was signed as a driver for the SEAT works team in the French Touring Car Championship. His best result was fifth place in the race at Nogaro and he finished thirteenth overall in the standings.

===Formula One===

====1994: Larrousse====
Towards the end of 1994, Larrousse was, like a number of other teams at the time, running short of money and needed pay drivers to keep the team afloat. Larrousse&#x27;s number 19 car, which had started the year being driven by Olivier Beretta, was now being driven by drivers who could bring sponsorship money to the team. For the final race of the year in Australia, Larrousse let the aero-car inexperienced, physically unfit Delétraz replace Érik Comas in the team&#x27;s second car for more sponsorship money in order to aid their financial situation.

During qualifying, Delétraz qualified in 25th position, ahead of Simtek&#x27;s Domenico Schiattarella. However, Schiattarella overtook him during the first lap of the Grand Prix, and Delétraz gradually dropped back from the rest of the field. He retired on lap 57 with gearbox failure, after he had already been lapped ten times. He was lapping the circuit six seconds slower than the leaders, two seconds slower than his teammate Hideki Noda and 1–2 seconds slower than the next slowest driver Schiattarella. He was described by BBC commentator Jonathan Palmer as &quot;having no business in Formula One.&quot;

====1995: Pacific====
Pacific Team Lotus started with shareholder Bertrand Gachot and Andrea Montermini as its drivers, but similar to Larrousse the previous year, the team needed pay drivers to continue the season and Gachot vacated his seat. It was announced that Delétraz would be competing in the final five races of the season.

During qualifying for his first round of the year, in Portugal, Delétraz was hindered by a gearbox problem which saw him qualify last, twelve seconds behind pole-position sitter David Coulthard. In the race, Delétraz was 40 seconds behind Coulthard after 3 laps, and was lapping the circuit 12 seconds slower than the leaders and 6–7 seconds than the next slowest driver Roberto Moreno in a Forti and 7–8 seconds slower than his team-mate Montermini. He was lapped by the leaders after seven laps of the race, and after fourteen he retired from the race with cramp in his left arm. This drew criticism as Estoril is a clockwise circuit, which requires more work from the right arm. In his second race at the Nürburgring, he qualified just over nine seconds behind pole-position, and he finished the race in fifteenth place as the last finisher, seven laps behind the winner. At one point while he was being lapped by the leaders, Delétraz suddenly darted his car across the track from one side to the other and back again, prompting BBC commentator Murray Walker to exclaim &quot;And what is Delétraz doing? Doesn&#x27;t matter what he&#x27;s doing.&quot;

At the next race, he was replaced by Bertrand Gachot after planned replacements were denied superlicenses. It had been expected that Delétraz would be competing until the end of the season, but he defaulted on payment and Keith Wiggins, principal of the Pacific team stated, &quot;On ability alone, we are not willing to keep him.&quot;

The slow qualifying speeds of drivers like Delétraz resulted in the introduction of the 107% rule for the 1996 season - with some F1 fans nicknaming the new regulation the &quot;Delétraz rule&quot; as a result.

===Sports Car Racing===

After his tenure in Formula One, Delétraz focused on endurance racing, running in the 24 Hours of LeMans and the BPR Global GT Series in 1995. 1996 saw Delétraz move to the FIRST Racing operation he now co-owned with fellow driver Fabien Giroix. Two years in the BPR Global GT Series in a McLaren F1 GTR was followed by a move to the FIA GT Championship in 1997, with FIRST running the works Lotus Elise GT1s. After a couple of years away, FIRST and Delétraz returned to the FIA Championship in 2000 with a Ferrari 550 Maranello. In 2002, he took four wins in the series with team-mate Andrea Piccini in a BMS Scuderia Italia-run 550, and the pair finished fifth in the championship. They then drove a works Lister Storm in 2003. He has also scored two class wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in 2001 and 2002 in the LMP675 class — profiting from a final lap suspension failure for the leading Welter-Peugeot during the latter. He was also one of the drivers of the Chevrolet Corvette C6.R that won the 2007 Spa 24 Hours.

Jean-Denis&#x27;s son, Louis, is also a racing driver with experience in Formula 2, endurance, and sports car racing.

Though they had a design maximum speed of , experience showed that they did not ride well when travelling at speeds over and so henceforth were limited to that speed. They were numbered E401–E419, and were withdrawn from service between 1968 and 1977 and none were preserved.

The E401 was available as a resin model from &quot;Q Kits&quot;, but this company is no longer trading as the owner has retired.

A 401 Body is now available from Shapeways via Valvedesigns (a Rapid Prototyping Service)

<text>KETV (channel 7) is a television station in Omaha, Nebraska, United States, affiliated with ABC. The station is owned by Hearst Television, and has studios on 10th Street in the historic Burlington Station, which carries the nickname of 7 Burlington Station. Its transmitter is located on a &quot;tower farm&quot; near North 72nd Street and Crown Point Avenue in north-central Omaha.

==History==

KETV first signed on the air on September 17, 1957; it was Omaha&#x27;s third television station (behind WOW-TV, channel 6, now WOWT and KMTV, channel 3). The station has been an ABC affiliate from its debut (and the only one in Omaha that has never changed its affiliation); KETV is the second full-time ABC affiliate in the Omaha market; KOLN-TV in Lincoln previously served as Omaha&#x27;s ABC affiliate for much of 1953 and 1954 until the Federal Communications Commission split off Lincoln into its own separate market from Omaha. Incidentally, until KLKN-TV signed on from Lincoln in 1996 (by then, KOLN had switched to CBS), KETV served as the default ABC affiliate for Nebraska&#x27;s state capital; to this day, KETV still retains significant viewership in Lincoln, and the station operates a news bureau in the city. Channel 7 was originally owned by the World Publishing Company, publisher of the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot;. It associated itself with the newspaper early on, branding itself as &quot;Omaha World-Herald Television.&quot;

Construction magnate Peter Kiewit, Jr. bought World Publishing in 1962. Due to a change in FCC regulations that barred the common ownership of newspapers and television stations in a single market, Kiewit sold the station to Pulitzer Broadcasting Company in 1976. In 1984, KETV introduced its current logo, which is a variation of the widely used Circle 7 logo; the logo received a slight update in 2000. In 1998, Pulitzer sold its entire broadcasting division, including KETV, to Hearst-Argyle Television (the predecessor of the present-day Hearst Television).

On July 4, 2003, KETV&#x27;s transmitter tower (at the North 72nd Street tower farm) collapsed during the addition of a digital television antenna. Because the collapse occurred late at night, there were no injuries; however, KETV was knocked off the air as a result. The station was forced to broadcast from its shorter auxiliary tower for over a year. A new tower was erected almost east of where the former tower stood on the tower farm and was completed in late 2004.

On July 9, 2012, a conflict between Hearst Television and Time Warner Cable caused KETV to be taken off the provider&#x27;s systems in the Lincoln market. This blackout lasted until July 19, 2012, when a carriage deal was reached between Hearst and Time Warner Cable.

On June 5, 2013, Hearst Television announced the purchase of the historic Burlington Station; the former train station was adaptively reused into a broadcasting and web media facility for KETV. On October 28, 2015, KETV&#x27;s news operation moved into the renovated building in downtown Omaha. The first broadcast aired at 5 p.m. that night.

On June 14, 2018, KETV was dropped from Spectrum&#x27;s channel lineup in Lincoln.

==Programming==
===Preemptions and deferrals===
From September 2006 until the program was dropped by ABC on August 28, 2010, KETV preempted ABC Kids broadcasts of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series due to lack of E/I content (as was common with Hearst&#x27;s other ABC stations); the station tape-delayed &quot;Kim Possible&quot; and &quot;Power Rangers SPD&quot; for broadcast on early Monday mornings before &quot;World News Now&quot; during the 2005–06 season for the same reason. All three programs, during their respective periods of time, were cleared by KLKN in Lincoln; as it covers the Omaha area to a decent amount, it served as the city&#x27;s default home for each program.

KETV was one of many ABC stations that preempted the special showing of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; in late 2004 due to concerns that the FCC would impose a fine on them if they had aired the World War II-set movie due to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy earlier that year. The station, along with other Hearst-owned ABC affiliated stations, aired the 1992 film &quot;Far and Away&quot; instead; for the above reason, the program aired on all of the state&#x27;s other ABC stations, and it was eventually determined that the movie&#x27;s broadcast did not violate FCC regulations.

KETV currently airs &quot;GMA3: What You Need To Know&quot; at 11 a.m. on a one-day behind basis due to a noon newscast.

===News operation===
KETV presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, hours on Saturdays and hours on Sundays). The station operates a Doppler weather radar called &quot;Next Generation Super Doppler 7&quot;, which is located near the station&#x27;s transmitter site near North 72nd Street and Crown Point Avenue. The high resolution weather radar was built in 2007 and updated in 2016. The radar tower at the Crown Point site replaced the original weather radar (later Doppler/Super Doppler 7) that had been based atop the station&#x27;s original studios on 27th &amp; Douglas Streets in downtown Omaha since the late 1970s. The Douglas Street radar tower and dome would remain standing and unused for several years until the demolition of the original KETV building in May 2016.

For the last three decades, the station&#x27;s newscasts have been branded as &quot;NewsWatch 7&quot;. Under its current ownership, the title was revised in 2000 to &quot;KETV NewsWatch 7&quot;. KETV was the first station in the market to have a full-time meteorologist beginning in the early 1970s, the first station to use live weather radar in the late 1970s, and was the second station to utilize Doppler weather radar in the early 1980s. In November 2006, KETV overtook long-time ratings leader WOWT to become the top-rated news station in the Omaha market. Since then, WOWT and CBS affiliate KMTV have fought for second place with KETV far in front of either station.

Among the many KETV alumni is John Coleman who worked at the station in the 1960s. Coleman later appeared as the meteorologist for &quot;Good Morning America&quot; before going on to develop and launch The Weather Channel in 1982. That same year, then-KETV chief meteorologist, Charlie Martin took a job at The Weather Channel to become one of the cable channel&#x27;s first on-camera meteorologists. Martin, who worked at KETV from the late 1970s through the early 1980s, was known on TWC as Charlie Levy.

Since 1982, KETV has been known for its weekly &quot;Crimestoppers&quot; segments, and has contributed to the arrest and conviction of more than 1,000 wanted felons. KETV has also had a long-running hotline and webpage called &quot;7 Can Help&quot;, which has and continues to contribute to helping the greater Omaha community through financial grants, high utility bill relief, and services for area children. &quot;7 Can Help&quot; has also been known to intercede on behalf of senior citizens with matters such as getting benefits that have been otherwise denied them.

In October 1996, KETV began televising all of its local newscasts from a &quot;working newsroom&quot; set known as &quot;The Newsplex&quot;, a multimillion-dollar broadcast facility (which is very similar in design to the newsroom set that has been used by Fox affiliate KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City since around the same time frame). In the years prior to the &quot;Newsplex&quot;, reporters and anchors had to type their news stories in a separate newsroom and deliver them to the &quot;NewsWatch 7&quot; set located on the opposite side of the building. In February 2006, KETV reformatted its investigative unit as the &quot;NewsWatch 7&quot; &quot;I-Team&quot;, in an effort to bring more attention to in depth investigative stories, along with health and consumer reporting. On February 1, 2010, KETV became the third television station in Omaha to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in 16:9 widescreen standard definition, which included the introduction of updated graphics. KETV was the last news operation in Omaha to upgrade to full high definition operations, a purposeful move as the new Burlington Station facilities were HD-ready from day one in late October 2015 and it was deemed cost-effective to remain in SD for the last few years at KETV&#x27;s original facilities.

KETV debuted an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast on September 5, 2022, which replaced &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; (which ended its run in May that year) and competes with WOWT&#x27;s newscast in the same timeslot. 

====Notable former on-air staff====
* John Coleman – meteorologist (1960s; one of the founders of The Weather Channel in 1982, died January 20, 2018)
* Jill Cordes – morning anchor (1990s; hosted of &quot;My First Place&quot; on HGTV)
* Harold Dow – anchor/reporter (late 1960s; became correspondent/investigative reporter - CBS News; deceased)
* Carol Schrader – weeknight anchor/reporter (1977–1996; hosted PBS interview program called &quot;Consider This&quot; from 1997 to 2006)

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


In July 2006, KETV launched digital subchannel 7.2 as a 24-hour local weather channel, &quot;Weather Now,&quot; an affiliate of The Local AccuWeather Channel with local weather information supplied by KETV&#x27;s meteorologists; &quot;Weather Now&quot; was also carried on local cable providers and was streamed on the station&#x27;s website. On September 1, 2011, KETV replaced &quot;Weather Now&quot; with the classic television network MeTV.

In September 2021, GetTV was added on 7.5.

KETV is one of several Hearst-owned ABC stations, and among a handful of ABC affiliates, that broadcasts high-definition programming in the 1080i resolution format rather than 720p like most ABC stations.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KETV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 20, using virtual channel 7.

As part of the SAFER Act, KETV kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

<text>Tobacco package warning messages are warning messages that appear on the packaging of cigarettes and other tobacco products concerning their health effects. They have been implemented in an effort to enhance the public&#x27;s awareness about the harmful effects of smoking. In general, warnings used in different countries try to emphasize the same messages. Warnings for some countries are listed below. Such warnings have been required in tobacco advertising for many years, with the earliest mandatory warning labels implemented in the United States in 1966. Implementing tobacco warning labels has been strongly opposed by the tobacco industry, most notably in Australia, following the implementation of plain packaging laws.

The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, adopted in 2003, requires such warning messages to promote awareness against smoking.

The effectiveness of tobacco warning labels has been studied extensively over the past 50 years, and research shows that they are generally effective in changing smoking attitudes and behaviors. A 2009 science review determined that there is &quot;clear evidence that tobacco package health warnings increase consumers&#x27; knowledge about the health consequences of tobacco use&quot;. The warning messages &quot;contribute to changing consumers&#x27; attitudes towards tobacco use as well as changing consumers&#x27; behavior&quot;.

Despite the demonstrated benefits of warning labels, the efficacy of fear-based messaging in reducing smoking behaviors has been subject to criticism. A 2007 meta-analysis demonstrated that messages emphasizing the severity of threat may be less effective at changing behaviors than messages focusing on susceptibility to threat, suggesting that extremely graphic warning labels are no more effective than labels that simply state the negative consequences of a behavior. Additionally, the study found that warning labels may not be effective among smokers who are not confident that they can quit, leading the authors to recommend exploring other methods of behavior modification.

In many countries, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including hematuria and diabetes) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Albania ==
As of 2020, all tobacco products in Albania must have one of the following general warning on the packaging: &quot;Smoking kills - quit now&quot; or &quot;Smoking kills&quot;. Additionally, packaging must contain an information message about the product, as follows: &quot;Tobacco contains over 70 substances that cause cancer&quot;. The general warning and the information message must occupy 50% of the packaging area of the side on which they are printed. Albania also requires the use of combined warnings that includes the text warning and a colored image, which must cover 65% of the front and back area of the packaging.

Text-based general warning label used on tobacco packages in Albania:
== Argentina ==
General warning (former): 
As of 30 January 2013, all cigarette packages must include graphical warning labels that show the detrimental effects on the health of long-term smokers, including COVID-19 (added in 2022).

== Australia ==

On 1 December 2012, Australia introduced ground-breaking legislation and the world&#x27;s toughest tobacco packaging warning messages to date. All marketing and brand devices were removed from the package and replaced with warnings, only the name of the product remains in generic standard sized text. All tobacco products sold, offered for sale or otherwise supplied in Australia were plain-packaged and labelled with new and expanded health warnings.

== Azerbaijan ==
In Azerbaijan, a text-only health warning in the Azeri language, &quot;Smoking harms your health&quot;, is required to cover 30% of the front and back of the package. There is no requirement for rotation, and there is only one required health warning. Misleading packaging and labeling, including terms such as &quot;light&quot; and &quot;mild,&quot; is prohibited.

== Bangladesh ==
The law requires rotating pictorial health warnings to cover at least 50% of the main display areas of all tobacco products. Misleading terms such as &quot;light&quot; and &quot;low tar&quot; are prohibited on tobacco packaging, but other misleading packaging (e.g., colors, numbers, and symbols) is not banned.

== Belgium ==
Belgium became a Party to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control on January 30, 2006. Belgium implemented their current health warnings policy starting April 2007. 
Including the border, health warnings cover 48% of the front and 63% of the back of cigarette packages, which is larger than the EU requirements of 35% front and 50% back because Belgium is a trilingual country (German, French, Flemish). Overall, 56% of the package space is appropriated to health warnings. Since 2011, three different sets of 14 warnings have been rotated every 12 months. 

Belgium prohibits the terms &quot;light&quot; and &quot;mild&quot; from appearing on packages.

Additionally, Belgium requires tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide emission numbers to appear on the side of packages. These emission numbers are generated using the ISO machine smoking method.

== Bolivia ==
In Bolivia, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including laryngeal cancer and heart attack) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Bosnia and Herzegovina ==
Front of packaging (covers 30% of surface):
* &quot;Pušenje je štetno za zdravlje&quot; (Smoking is harmful to health)
* &quot;Pušenje ubija&quot; (Smoking kills)
* &quot;Pušenje ozbiljno šteti vama i drugima oko vas&quot; (Smoking seriously harms you and others around you)

Back of packaging (covers 50% of surface):
* &quot;Pušenje uzrokuje rak pluća&quot; (Smoking causes lung cancer)
* &quot;Pušenje uzrokuje srčani udar&quot; (Smoking causes heart attacks)
* &quot;Pušenje uzrokuje moždani udar&quot; (Smoking causes strokes)
* &quot;Pušenje u trudnoći šteti zdravlju Vašeg djeteta&quot; (Smoking while pregnant harms your child)

Before 2011, a small warning with the text &quot;Pušenje je štetno za zdravlje&quot; (Smoking is harmful to health) was printed on the back of cigarette packets.

== Brazil ==
In 2001, Brazil became the second country in the world and the first country in Latin America to adopt mandatory warning images in cigarette packages. Warnings and graphic images illustrating the risks of smoking occupy 100% of the back of cigarette packs. In 2008, the government enacted a third batch of images aimed at younger smokers. The rule was in force for nine years until 2017, when yet another batch of warnings were introduced. They contain images as equally disturbing as the previous ones but also contain subtle messages such as &quot;Você morre&quot; (&quot;You die&quot;), &quot;Você sofre&quot; (&quot;You suffer&quot;) and &quot;Você adoece&quot; (&quot;You get sick&quot;).

Since 2003, the sentence
 is displayed in all packs.

== Brunei ==
The following warnings appear on Bruneian cigarette packages since 2007:
* (Smoking causes various cancers)
* (Smoking causes strokes and heart disease)
* (Smoking kills)
* (Smoking damages your teeth)
* (Tobacco smoke harms your baby)
* (Tobacco smoke can kill babies)
* (Smoking causes lung cancer)
* (Smoking causes impotence)

== Cambodia ==
In Cambodia, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including premature birth and lung cancer) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Canada ==
Canada has had three phases of tobacco warning labels. The first set of warnings was introduced in 1989 under the Tobacco Products Control Act, and required warnings to be printed on all tobacco products sold legally in Canada. The set consisted of four messages printed in black-and-white on the front and back of the package, and was expanded in 1994 to include eight messages covering 25% of the front top of the package.

In 2000, the Tobacco Products Information Regulations (TPIR) were passed under the Tobacco Act. The regulations introduced a new set of sixteen warnings. Each warning was printed on the front and back of the package, covering 50% of the surface, with a short explanation and a picture illustrating that particular warning, for example:

accompanied by a picture of cancerous growths inside a human lung.

Additionally, on the inside of the packaging or, for some packets, on a pull-out card, &quot;health information messages&quot; provide answers and explanations regarding common questions and concerns about quitting smoking and smoking-related illnesses. The side of the package also featured information on toxic emissions and constituent levels.

In 2011, the TPIR were replaced for cigarettes and little cigars with the Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars). These regulations introduced the third and current set of 16 warnings in Canada. Currently, cigarette and little cigar packages in Canada must bear new graphic warning messages that cover 75% of the front and back of the package. The interior of each package contains 1 of 8 updated health warning messages, all including the number for a national quitline. The side of the package now bears 1 of 4 simplified toxic emission statements. These labels were fully implemented on cigarette and little cigar packages by June 2012 (though the 2000 labels still appear on other tobacco products). Canada also prohibits terms such as &quot;light&quot; and &quot;mild&quot; from appearing on tobacco packaging. The current labels were based on extensive research and a long consultation process that sought to evaluate and improve upon the warnings introduced in 2000.

In accordance with Canadian law regarding products sold legally in Canada, the warnings are provided in both English and French. Imported cigarettes to be sold in Canada which do not have the warnings are affixed with sticker versions when they are sold legally in Canada.

Health Canada considered laws mandating plain packaging, legal tobacco product packaging did still include warning labels, but brand names, fonts, and colors were replaced with simple unadorned text, thereby reducing the impact of tobacco industry marketing techniques.

There have been complaints from some Canadians due to the graphic nature of the labels. It was mandated in January 2020.

Canada became the first country in the world to require health warnings on each individual cigarettes and cigars, effective August 1, 2023, to be phased in over time when the regulation is fully in effect by April 2025.

== Chile ==
Starting in November 2006, all cigarette packages sold in Chile are required to have one of two health warnings, a graphic pictorial warning or a text-only warning. These warnings are replaced with a new set of two warnings each year.

== China ==
Under laws of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the &quot;Law on Tobacco Monopoly&quot; (中华人民共和国烟草专卖法) Chapter 4, Article 18 and &quot;Regulations for the Implementation of the Law on Tobacco Monopoly&quot; (中华人民共和国烟草专卖法实施条例) Chapter 5 Article 29, cigarettes and cigars sold within Mainland China should indicate the grade of tar content and &quot;Smoking is hazardous to your health&quot; (吸烟有害健康) in the Chinese language on the packs and cartons.

In 2009, the warnings were changed. The warnings, which occupy not less than 30% of the front and back of cigarette packs, show &quot;吸烟有害健康 尽早戒烟有益健康&quot; (Smoking is harmful to your health. Quitting smoking early is good for your health) in the front and &quot;吸烟有害健康 戒烟可减少对健康的危害&quot; (Smoking is harmful to your health. Quitting smoking can reduce health risks) in the back.

The warnings were revised in October 2016 and must occupy at least 35% of the front and back of cigarette packs. The following are the current warnings.
* In the front:
*: 本公司提示吸烟有害健康请勿在禁烟场所吸烟
*:(&quot;Our company notes that smoking is harmful to your health. Do not smoke in non-smoking areas&quot; in Chinese)
* In the back:
*: 尽早戒烟有益健康戒烟可减少对健康的危害
*:(&quot;Quitting smoking as soon as possible is good for your health. It can also reduce health risks&quot; in Chinese)
* or
*: 劝阻青少年吸烟禁止中小学生吸烟
*:(&quot;Dissuade teenagers from smoking. Prohibit primary and middle school students from smoking&quot; in Chinese)

== Colombia ==
In Colombia, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including clogged arteries and bladder cancer) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Costa Rica ==
In Costa Rica, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including lung cancer and heart attack) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== East Timor ==
East Timor only used a text warning, &quot;FUMA OHO ITA&quot; (Smoking kills), prior to 2018, when new pictorial warnings covering 85% of the front and 100% of the back of packages were implemented.

The warnings currently in use are:
* FUMA OHO ITA (Smoking kills), featuring a crucifix made of cigarettes placed on a pile of human skulls.
* FUMA KAUZA IMPOTÉNSIA (Smoking causes impotence)
* FUMA PROVOKA MORAS FUAN (Smoking can cause heart attacks)
* FUMA KAUZA ABORTU (Smoking causes abortions)
* FUMA PROVOKA KANKRU (Smoking can cause cancer)
* FUMA KAUZA PULMAUN KRONIKU (Smoking causes chronic lung disease)
* Konsulta atu para fuma – Numero telf: 113 (Consultation for quitting smoking – Phone number: 113), accompanying all of these warnings.

== Ecuador ==
In Ecuador, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including tongue cancer and premature birth) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Egypt ==
In Egypt, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including mouth cancer and gangrene) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== European Union ==

Cigarette packets and other tobacco packaging must include warnings in the same size and format and using the same approved texts (in the appropriate local languages) in all member states of the European Union.

These warnings are displayed in black Helvetica bold on a white background with a thick black border. Ireland once prefaced its warnings with &quot;Irish Government Warning&quot;, Latvia with &quot;Veselības ministrija brīdina&quot; (&quot;Health Ministry Warning&quot;) and Spain with &quot;Las autoridades sanitarias advierten&quot; (&quot;The Health Board Warns&quot;). In member states with more than one official language, the warnings are displayed in all official languages, with the sizes adjusted accordingly (for example in Belgium the messages are written in Dutch, French and German, in Luxembourg in French and German and in Ireland, in Irish and English). All cigarette packets sold in the European Union used to have to display the content of nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide in the same manner on the side of the packet, this is no longer the case.
In 2003, it was reported that sales of cigarette cases had surged, attributable to the introduction of more prominent warning labels on cigarette packs by an EU directive in January 2003. Alternatively, people choose to hide the warnings using various &quot;funny&quot; stickers, such as &quot;You could be hit by a bus tomorrow.&quot;

The most recent EU legislation is the Tobacco Products Directive, which became applicable in EU countries in May 2016.

=== Ireland ===

Ireland currently follows EU standards (see above), but previously ran its own scheme, where one of 8 messages was placed on the pack, as defined in SI 326/1991.

After a High Court settlement in January 2008, it was accepted that the warnings on tobacco products must appear in both official languages of the state. As a result, the European Communities (Manufacture, Presentation 
and Sale of Tobacco Products) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 were put in place. This provides that tobacco products going to market after 30 September 2008 must carry warnings in Irish and English. A year-long transition period applied to products which were on the market prior to 1 October 2008, which may have been sold until 1 October 2009.

Each packet of tobacco products must carry:
*One of the following general warnings (in both the Irish and English languages) which must cover at least 32% of the external side.
**Toradh caithimh tobac – bás – &quot;Smoking kills&quot;
**Déanann caitheamh tobac díobháil thromchúiseach duit agus do na daoine mórthimpeall ort – &quot;Smoking seriously harms you and others around you&quot;
*and one of the following additional warnings (in both the Irish and English languages) which must cover at least 45% of the external side.
**Giorrú saoil tobac a chaitheamh – &quot;Smokers die younger&quot;
**Nuair a chaitear tobac, tachtar na hartairí agus is é cúis le taomanna croí agus strócanna – &quot;Smoking clogs the arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes&quot;
**Caitheamh tobac is cúis le hailse scamhóg mharfach – &quot;Smoking causes fatal lung cancer&quot;
**Má chaitheann tú tobac le linn toirchis, déantar díobháil don leanbán – &quot;Smoking when pregnant harms your baby&quot;
**Cosain leanaí: ná cuir iallach orthu do chuid deataigh an análú – &quot;Protect children: don&#x27;t make them breathe your smoke&quot;
**Féadann do dhochtúir nó do chógaiseoir cabhrú leat éirí as caitheamh tobac &quot;Your doctor or your pharmacist can help you stop smoking&quot;

**Féadann caitheamh tobac dochar a dhéanamh don speirm agus laghdaíonn sé torthúlacht – &quot;Smoking can damage the sperm and decreases fertility&quot;
**Cuimsíonn deatach beinséin, nítreasaimíní, formaildéad agus ciainíd hidrigine – &quot;Smoke contains benzene, nitrosamines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide&quot;
*In the case of Smokeless Tobacco Products, only the following warning must be displayed:
**Féadann an táirge tobac seo dochar a dhéanamh do shláinte agus is táirge andúile é – &quot;This tobacco product can damage your health and is addictive&quot;

== Honduras ==
In Honduras, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including a lung cancer and throat cancer) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Hong Kong ==

Under Hong Kong Law, Chap 371B &quot;Smoking (Public Health) (Notices) Order&quot;, packaging must indicate the amount of nicotine and tar that is present in cigarette boxes in addition to graphics depicting different health problems caused by smoking in the size and ratio as prescribed by law. The warnings are to be published in both official languages, Traditional Chinese and English.

Every warning begins with the phrase &#x27;/HKSAR GOVERNMENT WARNING&#x27; and then one of the following in all caps:
* /Smoking causes lung cancer
* /Smoking kills
* /Smoking harms your family
* /Smoking causes peripheral vascular diseases
* /Smoking may cause impotence
* /Smoking can accelerate aging of the skin

In addition, any print advertisement must give minimum 85% coverage of the following warnings:

HKSAR GOVERNMENT HEALTH WARNING
* January - February SMOKING KILLS
* March - April SMOKING CAUSES CANCER
* May - June SMOKING CAUSES HEART DISEASE
* July - August SMOKING CAUSES LUNG CANCER
* September - October SMOKING CAUSES RESPIRATORY DISEASES
* November - December SMOKING HARMS YOUR CHILDREN

In 2018, a new batch of warnings were introduced, consisting of the following warnings that cover 85% of packs:
== Iceland ==
All cigarette packets and other tobacco packaging in Iceland must include warnings in the same size and format as in the European Union and using the same approved texts in Icelandic.

General warning:
These warnings are also used:
* (Your doctor or pharmacist can help you quit smoking)
* (Smoking causes cancer)
* (Smoking is very harmful to you and those close to you)
* (Smoking blocks your arteries and causes coronary artery disease and strokes)
* (Smoking causes fatal lung cancer)
* (Smoking during pregnancy harms your child)
* (Protect children – Don&#x27;t let them inhale tobacco smoke)

== India ==
Cigarette packets sold in India are required to carry graphical and textual health warnings. The warning must cover at least 85% of the surface of the pack, of which 60% must be pictorial and the remaining 25% contains textual warnings in English, Hindi or any other Indian language.

In 2003, India ratified the World Health Organisation&#x27;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which includes a recommendation for large, clear health warnings on tobacco packages. However, there was a delay in implementing graphic warning labels.

Until 2008, cigarette packets sold in India were required to carry a written warning on the front of the packet with the text &quot;CIGARETTE SMOKING IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH&quot; in English. Paan, gutkha and tobacco packets carried the warning &quot;TOBACCO IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH&quot; in Hindi and English. The law later changed. According to the new law, cigarette packets were required to carry pictorial warnings of a skull or scorpion along with the text &quot;SMOKING KILLS&quot; and &quot;TOBACCO CAUSES MOUTH CANCER&quot; in both Hindi and English.

&quot;The Cigarette and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules 2008&quot; requiring graphic health warnings came into force on 31 May 2008. Under the law, all tobacco products were required to display graphic pictures, such as pictures of diseased lungs, and the text &quot;SMOKING KILLS&quot; or &quot;TOBACCO KILLS&quot; in English, covering at least 40% of the front of the pack, and retailers must display the cigarette packs in such a way that the pictures on pack are clearly visible. In January 2012, controversy arose when it was discovered that an image of former English footballer John Terry was used on a warning label.

On 15 October 2014, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan announced that only 15% of the surface of a pack of cigarettes could contain branding, and that the rest must be used for graphic and text health warnings. The Union Ministry of Health amended the &quot;Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Packaging and Labelling) Rules, 2008&quot; to enforce the changes effective from 1 April 2015.

However, the government decision to increase pictorial warnings on tobacco packets from 1 April was put on hold indefinitely, following the recommendations of a Parliamentary committee, which reportedly did not speak to health experts but only to tobacco lobby representatives. On 5 April 2016, the health ministry ordered government agencies to enforce this new rule.

Following the intervention by the Parliamentary committee, NGO Health of Millions, represented by Prashant Bhushan, filed a petition in the Supreme Court of India, which asked the government to stop selling of loose cigarettes and publish bigger health warnings on tobacco packs.

== Indonesia ==
In Indonesia, tobacco warnings are not just placed on packages but also on cigarette advertisements, which are not banned in few countries including Indonesia.

=== January 1980–December 1999 ===
=== January 2000–December 2013 ===
With the enforcement of Indonesian Government Regulation No. 19 (2000), a new warning was implemented:
The last recorded usage of this warning in TV advertisements was an Esse Mild advertisement from late February 2014.

=== December 2013–December 2018 ===

With the enforcement of the Indonesian Government Regulation No. 109 (2012), all tobacco products/cigarette packaging and advertisement should include warning images and age restriction (18+). Graphic warnings must cover 40% of cigarette packages. After the introduction of graphic images in Indonesian cigarette packaging, the branding of cigarettes as &quot;light&quot;, &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;filter&quot;, etc. is forbidden, except for brands that already use some words above such as L.A. Lights, A Mild or Dunhill Filter. However, the last advertisement to use this warning was a 2021 Djarum Super advertisement, before it subsequently used the 2018 warning.

=== January 2019–present ===
After it was revealed that the pictorial warnings used in Indonesia originally came from the 2005 warnings of Thailand, on 31 May 2018, the Ministry of Health launched new pictorial health warnings, of which two depict Indonesian smokers and one depicts a smoker from Venezuela.

== Iran ==
In Iran, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including lung cancer and mouth cancer) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.
Additionally, many cigarette packs contain a writing under the image which says &quot;ترک سیگار موجب سلامتی و افزایش طول عمرمیشود&quot; and in English it roughly means &quot;quitting cigarettes makes you healthier and increases lifespan&quot;.

== Japan ==

In 1972, Japan became the first country in Asia to display a general warning on cigarette packages.

Prior to 2005, there was only one warning on all Japanese cigarette packages.
* (For the good of your health, be careful not to smoke too much) (1972–1989)
* (Be careful not to smoke too much, as there is a risk of damaging your health) (1990–2005)

Since 2005, more than one general warning is printed on cigarette packaging.

On the front of cigarette packages:
* (Smoking is a cause of lung cancer. According to epidemiological estimates, smokers are about two to four times more likely than non-smokers to die of lung cancer.)
* (Smoking increases risk of myocardial infarctions. According to epidemiological estimates, smokers are about 1.7 times more likely than non-smokers to die of a heart attack.)

In Laos, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including mouth cancer and rotting teeth) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Malaysia ==
In Malaysia, general warning as a mandatory on all Malaysian cigarette packaging are in force since June 1976.

* (Warning from the Government of Malaysia: Smoking endangers health)

Starting 1 June 2009, the Malaysian government has decided to place graphic images on the cigarette packs to show the adverse long-term effects of excessive smoking, replacing the general warning with text describing the graphic images printed in Malay (front) and English (back) explaining:

* &quot;Amaran: Rokok penyebab ...&quot;
* &quot;Warning: Cigarettes cause ...&quot;

Graphic warning messages must consist 40% of the front of cigarette packages and 60% in the back. After the introduction of graphic images in Malaysian cigarette packaging, the branding of cigarettes as &quot;light&quot;, &quot;mild&quot;, etc. is forbidden.

==Maldives==
In the Maldives, products containing tobacco are required by law to have (in Dhivehi):

At the front and back:

* A cessation message eg. &quot;Stop quickly!&quot; ()
* A graphic image eg. cut open body showing lung cancer
* Description of the image

On the sides:
* Explanatory message of complications caused by tobacco eg. &quot;Tobacco contains 250 poisonous chemicals. These poisons damage vital organs of the body, causing cancer, stroke, lung damage, and other such painful illnesses.&quot; ()
* A message &quot;Get help from a health professional to save yourself!&quot; ()

== Mexico ==
Since 2010, cigarette packs in Mexico must contain health warnings and graphic images. By law, 30% of the pack&#x27;s front, 100% of the pack&#x27;s rear and 100% of one lateral must consist on images and warnings. The Secretariat of Health issues new warnings and images every six months. Images have included a dead rat, a partial mastectomy, a laryngectomy, a dead human fetus surrounded by cigarette butts, a woman being fed after suffering a stroke and damaged lungs, amongst others.

Warnings include smoking-related diseases and statistics, toxins found in cigarettes and others.

Mexico became the first country to put a warning on cigarette packs that tobacco use could increase the risk of COVID-19 infection.

There is no such rule in Transnistria, where cigarette packages have variable warning labels depending on where they come from.

== New Zealand ==
The first health warnings appeared on cigarette packets in New Zealand in 1974. Warning images accompanying text have been required to appear on each packet since 28 February 2008. New regulations were made on 14 March 2018 which provided for larger warnings and a new schedule of images and messages.

By law, 75% of a pack&#x27;s front and 100% of its rear must consist of warning messages. Images include gangrenous toes, rotting teeth and gums, diseased lungs and smoking-damaged hearts. Cigarette packets also carry the New Zealand Quitline logo and phone number and other information about quitting smoking.

In total, there are 15 different warnings. A full list with pictures is available at the New Zealand Ministry of Health&#x27;s website. Warning messages are rotated annually. The following is a list of the warnings in English and Māori.

* Smoking causes heart attacks, KA PĀ MAI NGĀ MANAWA-HĒ I TE KAI PAIPA
* Smoking causes over 80% of lung cancers, NEKE ATU I TE 80% O NGĀ MATE PUKUPUKU KI NGĀ PŪKAHUKAHU I AHU MAI I TE KAI PAIPA

Six warnings existed prior to 2013:
* Smoking is addictive
* Smoking damages lungs
* Smoking can kill
* Smoking can cause cancer
* Smoking can damage the fetus

From 2013 onwards, the general warning is: &quot;The Federal Ministry of Health warns that smokers are liable to die young.&quot;

== North Korea ==
North Korea signed the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control on 17 June 2003 and ratified it on 27 April 2005. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print on the side of the package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging in North Korea.

== Norway ==
Norway has had general warnings on cigarette packets since 1975. Norway&#x27;s warnings of today were introduced in 2003 and are in line with the European Union&#x27;s legislation, as Norway is an EEA member:

On the front of cigarette and cigar packages, covering about 30% of the area:
* (Smoking kills)
* (Smoking is very harmful to you and your surroundings)

On the back of cigarette and cigar packages, covering about 45% of the area:
* (Smoking causes fatal lung cancer)
* (If you stop smoking, you will reduce the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases)
* (Smoking causes early ageing of the skin)
* (Smoking may reduce the blood flow and cause impotence)
* (Smoking can cause a slow and painful death)
* (Smoking can reduce sperm quality and decrease fertility)
* (Protect children against smoke, don&#x27;t let them inhale your smoke)
* (Smoking is highly addictive: Don&#x27;t start smoking)

== Pakistan ==
All cigarettes are required by Statutory Order 1219(I)/2008 dated 25 September 2008, published in the Gazette of Pakistan dated 24 November 2008, to carry rotating health warnings from 1 July 2009.

Each health warning is printed for a period of 6 months, covering at least 30% on both sides of the packet and must be printed in Urdu at the front and English at the back. The warnings in English currently in use are:

* Protect children, do not let them breathe your smoke – Ministry of Health
* Smoking causes mouth and throat cancer – Ministry of Health
* Quit smoking and live a longer life – Ministry of Health
* Smoking severely harms you and the people around you – Ministry of Health

== Panama ==
In Panama, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including throat cancer and lung cancer) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Paraguay ==
In Paraguay, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including impotence and heart attack) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Peru ==
In Peru, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including abortions and asthma) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Philippines ==

All cigarette packaging sold in the Philippines are required to display a government warning label. The warnings include:

* Government Warning: Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health.
* Government Warning: Cigarettes are addictive.
* Government Warning: Tobacco smoke can harm your children.
* Government Warning: Smoking kills.

In July 2014, President Benigno Aquino III signed the Republic Act 10643, or &quot;An Act to Effectively Instill Health Consciousness through Graphic Health Warnings on Tobacco Products&quot;, more known as the &quot;Graphic Health Warning Act.&quot; This law requires tobacco product packaging to display pictures of the ill effects of smoking, occupying the bottom half of the display area in both front and the back side of the packaging. On 3 March 2016, Department of Health (DOH) secretary Janette Garin started the implementation of Republic Act 10643, requiring tobacco manufacturers to include graphic health warnings on newer cigarette packaging.

With the Graphic Health Warning Act implemented, graphic health warnings are used on all newer cigarette packages and older packages using text-only warnings are required to be replaced by newer ones incorporating graphic warnings. The 12 new warnings, showing photos of negative effects of smoking, like mouth cancer, impotence and gangrene are rotated every two years, and on 3 November 2016, all cigarette packaging without graphic health warning messages are banned from sale. Labeling of cigarettes with &quot;light&quot; or &quot;mild&quot; is also forbidden by the Graphic Health Warning Act.

== Russia ==
Warning messages on Russian cigarette packets were revised in 2013, falling in line with European Union standards.
12 different variants are used.

== Serbia ==
The warning messages on Serbian cigarette packets are visually similar to what is used in European Union countries, but the texts used in Serbia are not translated from EU-approved texts.
== Singapore ==
Singapore used blunt, straight-to-the-point messages such as &quot;Smoking causes lung cancer&quot; as text warnings on cigarette packets. They were later replaced by graphic warnings in August 2004, with gory pictures and the following messages:
*Smoking causes a slow and painful death
*Smoking harms your family
*Tobacco smoke can kill babies
*Smoking causes strokes
*Smoking causes lung cancer
*Smoking causes mouth diseases

In 2016, the images and warnings were revised, with images focusing mostly on damaged organs. The following warnings show what is printed nowadays.
*Smoking causes mouth diseases
*Smoking can cause a slow and painful death
*Smoking causes lung cancer
*Smoking causes gangrene
*Smoking causes neck cancer
*Smoking harms your family
*Smoking causes 92% of oral cancers

From 1 January 2009, people possessing cigarettes without the SDPC (Singapore Duty Paid Cigarettes) label will be committing an offence under the Customs and GST Acts. The law was passed to distinguish non-duty paid, contraband cigarettes from duty-paid ones.

== Somalia ==
A small warning, in Somali and English, is printed on Somali cigarette packages.

== South Africa ==
In South Africa, the Tobacco Products Control Act, 1993 and its amendments (1999, 2007, 2009), stipulate that a warning related to the harmful effects (health, social, or economic) of tobacco smoking, or the beneficial effects of cessation, must be placed prominently on tobacco products covering 15% of the obverse, 25% of the reverse and 20% of the sides of packs.

According to the draft &quot;Control of Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill&quot;, 2018, new legislation, once enacted, will require uniform, plain-colored packaging (branding and logos prohibited) containing the brand and product name in a standard typeface and color, a warning related to the harmful effects of tobacco smoking, or beneficial effects of cessation, and a graphic image of tobacco-related harm.
== South Korea ==
In South Korea, general warnings on cigarette packaging have been used since 1976. The warning messages used since then have been:

* &quot;From 1976 to November 1989&quot;: (For your health, please refrain from smoking too much)

* &quot;From December 1989 to 1996&quot;: (Smoking may cause lung cancer and it is especially dangerous for teenagers and pregnant women)

* From 2017, more pictorial warnings were added to cigarette packs.

== Sri Lanka ==
In Sri Lanka, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including cancer and heart attack) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

Switzerland has warning messages in its three official languages (German, French and Italian). The three warning messages below, all meaning &quot;Smoking kills&quot;, are posted on cigarette packs until 2024:
* Rauchen tötet.
* Fumer tue.
* Il fumo uccide.

Since October 2024, the Federal Act on Tobacco Products updated the warnings to &quot;Smoking kills – stop now&quot;:
* Rauchen ist tödlich – hören Sie jetzt auf
* Fumer tue – Arrêtez maintenant.
* Il fumo uccide – smetti subito.

== Taiwan ==
The warnings in Taiwan are led by the phrase &quot;行政院衛生署警告&quot; (&quot;Warning from the Department of Health, Executive Yuan:&quot;) and followed by one of the following warnings:
* 吸菸有害健康: &quot;Smoking is hazardous to your health&quot;

== Thailand ==

In Thailand, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including a tracheotomy and rotting teeth) are placed prominently on cigarette packages. A recent study showed that the warnings made Thai smokers think more often about the health risks of smoking and about quitting smoking.

Thailand introduced plain packaging in 2020.

or

;Back of packaging (covers 40% of surface)

== Ukraine ==
The warning messages on Ukrainian cigarette packets are also visually similar to those in European Union countries:

== United Kingdom ==
In 1971, tobacco companies printed on the left side of cigarette packets an official warning: &quot;Warning by H.M. Government – Smoking can harm your health&quot;, followed by the phrase &quot;Health Department&#x27;s Chief Medical Officers&quot;, issuers of the warning.

In 1991, the EU tightened laws on tobacco warnings. Thus, the message &quot;Tobacco seriously damages health&quot; was printed on the front of all tobacco packs. An additional warning was also printed on the reverse of cigarette packs.

In 2003, new EU regulations required one of the following general warnings must be displayed, covering at least 30% of the surface of the pack:
* Smoking kills (- quit now)
* Smoking seriously harms you and others around you

Additionally, one of the following additional warnings must be displayed, covering at least 40% of the surface of the pack:
* Smokers die younger
* Smoking clogs the arteries and causes heart attacks and strokes
* Smoking causes fatal lung cancer
* Smoking when pregnant harms your baby
* Protect children: don&#x27;t make them breathe your smoke
* Your doctor or your pharmacist can help you stop smoking
* Smoking is highly addictive, don&#x27;t start
* Stopping smoking reduces the risk of fatal heart and lung diseases
* Smoking can cause a slow and painful death
* Get help to stop smoking: [telephone]/[postal address]/[internet address]/consult your doctor/pharmacist
* Smoking may reduce the blood flow and cause impotence
* Smoking causes ageing of the skin
* Smoking can damage the sperm and decreases fertility
* Smoke contains benzene, nitrosamines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide

From October 2008, all cigarette products manufactured must carry picture warnings in the reverse. Every pack must have one of these warnings by October 2009.

Plain packaging, including prominent and standardised health warnings and minimal manufacturer information, became compulsory for all cigarette and hand-rolling tobacco packs manufactured after May 2016 and sold after May 2017.

== United States==

In 1966, the United States became the first nation in the world to require a health warning on cigarette packages.

In 1973, the assistant director of Research at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company wrote an internal memorandum regarding new brands of cigarettes for the youth market. He observed that, &quot;psychologically, at eighteen, one is immortal&quot; and theorized that &quot;the desire to be daring is part of the motivation to start smoking.&quot; He stated, &quot;in this sense the label on the package is a plus.&quot;

In 1999, Philip Morris USA purchased three brands of cigarettes from Liggett Group Inc. The brands were: Chesterfield, L&amp;M, and Lark. At the time Philip Morris purchased the brands from Liggett, the packaging for those cigarettes included the statement &quot;Smoking is Addictive&quot;. After Philip Morris acquired the three Liggett brands, it removed the statement from the packages.

Though the United States started the trend of labeling cigarette packages with warnings, today the country has one of the least restrictive labelling requirements on their packages. Warnings are usually in small typeface placed along one of the sides of the cigarette packs with colors and fonts that closely resemble the rest of the package, so the warnings essentially are integrated and do not stand out with the rest of the cigarette package.

However, this is subject to change as the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 requires color graphics with supplemental text that depicts the negative consequences of smoking to cover 50% of the front and rear of each pack. The nine new graphic warning labels were announced by the FDA in June 2011 and were required to appear on packaging by September 2012, though this was delayed by legal challenges.

In August 2011, five tobacco companies filed a lawsuit against the FDA in an effort to reverse the new warning mandate. Tobacco companies claimed that being required to promote government anti-smoking campaigns by placing the new warnings on packaging violates the companies&#x27; free speech rights. Additionally, R.J. Reynolds, Lorillard, Commonwealth Brands Inc., Liggett Group LLC and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company Inc. claimed that the graphic labels are an unconstitutional way of forcing tobacco companies to engage in anti-smoking advocacy on the government&#x27;s behalf. A First Amendment lawyer, Floyd Abrams, represented the tobacco companies in the case, contending that requiring graphic warning labels on a lawful product cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. The Association of National Advertisers and the American Advertising Federation also filed a brief in the suit, arguing that the labels infringe on commercial free speech and could lead to further government intrusion if left unchallenged.

On 29 February 2012, US District Judge Richard Leon ruled that the labels violate the right to free speech in the First Amendment. However, the following month the US Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld the majority of the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, including the part requiring graphic warning labels. In April 2013 the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal to this ruling, allowing the new labels to stand. As the original ruling against the FDA images was not actually reversed, the FDA will again need to go through the process of developing the new warning labels, and the timetable and final product remain unknown. Additionally, rulings of the 6th Circuit are precedential only in the states comprising the 6th Circuit, i.e., Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee.

In March 2020, the FDA approved a set of 11 new graphic warning labels with images for cigarette packaging, with a deadline of compliance being set to June 18, 2021. The mandate would have required packaging to cover the top 50% of the front and rear panels of packages, as well as at least 20% of the top. Tobacco manufacturers R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Philip Morris USA, ITG Brands LLC and Liggett Group LLC filed a joint motion requesting a preliminary injunction on implementing the labels and a ruling to prohibit enforcement in April 2020. They argued that the new packaging would have been a violation of the First Amendment. In December 2022, U.S. district judge J. Campbell Barker of the Eastern District of Texas ordered the new guidelines to be vacated, arguing the multiple interpretation of images cannot prove neutrality. The deadline was pushed to November 6, 2023. The decision was later appealed and overturned by a U.S. Appeals court who ruled unanimously that the warnings where &quot;factual and uncontroversial&quot; and thus was not in violation of the first amendment. The decision was later appealed again to the U.S. Supreme Court however they declined to hear the case, thus making the new packaging legal. In September 2024 the FDA announced that Enforcement of the new packaging would begin on December 12, 2025.

=== Cigars ===
* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Cancers of the Mouth And Throat, Even If You Do Not Inhale.
* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigars Are Not A Safe Alternative To Cigarettes.
* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Smoke Increases The Risk of Lung Cancer And Heart Disease, Even in Nonsmokers.

* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Use Increases The Risk of Infertility, Stillbirth, And Low Birth Weight.
* SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: This Product Contains/Produces Chemicals Known to the State of California To Cause Cancer, And Birth Defects Or Other Reproductive Harm.

Stronger warning labels started to appear in May 2010, but are yet to be officially implemented.

=== Smokeless tobacco ===

Effective June 2010, the following labels began to appear on smokeless tobacco products (most of which are chewing tobacco) and their advertisements.
* Warning: This product can cause mouth cancer.
* Warning: This product can cause gum disease and tooth loss.
* Warning: This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes.
* Warning: Smokeless tobacco is addictive.

These warnings are required to comprise 30% of two principal display panels on the packaging; on advertisements, the health warnings must constitute 20% of the total area.

== Uruguay ==
In Uruguay, a variety of warnings with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms (including lung cancer and mouth cancer) are placed prominently on cigarette packages.

== Venezuela ==
Since 1978 in Venezuela, the only warning in cigarette packs was printed in a very small typeface along one of the sides:

&quot;&quot; (It has been determined that cigarette smoking is harmful to your health – Cigarette Tax Law)

On 24 March 2005, another warning was introduced in every cigarette pack, similar to what was implemented in Brazil: &quot;Este producto contiene alquitrán, nicotina y monóxido de carbono, los cuales son cancerígenos y tóxicos. No existen niveles seguros para el consumo de estas sustancias&quot; (&quot;This product contains tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide, which are carcinogenic and toxic. There are no safe levels for consumption of these substances&quot;).

The 1978 warning was not removed, so now every cigarette pack contains both warnings (one on each side).

In addition, since 24 March 2005, as part of the &quot;Venezuela 100% libre de humo&quot; (100% smoke-free Venezuela) campaign, one of the following warnings is randomly printed very prominently, along with a graphical image, occupying 100% of the back of the pack (40% for the text warning and 60% for the image):

* (This product is hazardous to your health and is addictive)
* (Smoking causes bad breath, tooth decay and mouth cancer)
* (Smoking causes lung cancer, coughing, pulmonar emphysema and chronic bronchitis). The picture accompanying this warning is a comparison between a smoker&#x27;s lung on the left and a healthy lung on the right.
* (Smoking causes cardiac infarction. R.I.P. bearer, killed by smoking)
* (Smoking while pregnant harms your baby&#x27;s health)
* (Children start smoking when they see adults smoke)
* (Smoking cigarettes causes laryngeal cancer)
* (Smoking causes impotence in men)
* (Cigarette smoke also harms those who don&#x27;t smoke)
* (Take your first step today, quitting smoking is possible)

Curiously, these warnings only appear on cigarette packs and not on other tobacco products (which only use the 1978 warning).

== Vietnam ==
The following warnings appear on Vietnamese cigarette packages since 2013, along with graphic, disturbing images of tobacco-related harms:
* (Smoking leads to a slow and painful death)
* (Cigarette smoke is harmful to infants and young children)
* (Smoking causes heart diseases)
* (Smoking causes throat and laryngeal cancer)
* (Smoking causes halitosis and damages teeth)
* (Smoking causes lung cancer)

<doc id="1233990" wikidata="Q687638" url="?curid=1233990" title="Erich Hecke">
<text>Erich Hecke (20 September 1887 – 13 February 1947) was a German mathematician known for his work in number theory and the theory of modular forms.

==Biography==
Hecke was born in Buk, Province of Posen, German Empire (now Poznań, Poland). He obtained his doctorate in Göttingen under the supervision of David Hilbert.

Kurt Reidemeister and Heinrich Behnke were among his students.

In 1933 Hecke signed the &quot;Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State&quot;, but was later known as being opposed to the Nazis.

Hecke died in Copenhagen, Denmark.

André Weil, in the foreword to his text Basic Number Theory says: &quot;To improve upon Hecke, in a treatment along classical lines of the theory of algebraic numbers, would be a futile and impossible task&quot;, referring to Hecke&#x27;s book &quot;Lectures on the Theory of Algebraic Numbers.&quot;

==Research==
His early work included establishing the functional equation for the Dedekind zeta function, with a proof based on theta functions. The method extended to the L-functions associated to a class of characters now known as Hecke characters or idele class characters; such L-functions are now known as Hecke L-functions. He devoted most of his research to the theory of modular forms, creating the general theory of cusp forms (holomorphic, for GL(2)), as it is now understood in the classical setting.

==Recognition==
He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo.

<doc id="1233998" wikidata="Q2726215" url="?curid=1233998" title="Renault 10">
<text>The Renault 10 is a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive small family car produced by the French manufacturer Renault between 1965 and 1971. A larger, more upmarket version of the 8, it was launched in 1965. In 1971 it was replaced by the front-wheel drive Renault 12, which was built in parallel for two years.

The 10 was also produced in Bulgaria until 1970 (see Bulgarrenault), and in Spain.

==History==

In September 1965 the Renault 10 Major (branded in some markets as the Renault 1100) was launched, replacing the Renault 8 Major. This was a lengthened version of the Renault 8 with an increased front overhang and a much enlarged front luggage compartment, its capacity increased from 240 to 315 litres. The front and rear of the cars were fully redesigned, while the dimensions and sheetmetal of the central passenger cabin were unchanged. The 1,108 cc engine, which for some markets had already appeared in top of the range versions of the Renault 8, came from the Renault Caravelle. In the French market, the Renault 10 found itself struggling to compete with the successful Peugeot 204 introduced in the same year. In the United States, the Renault 10 was offered as &quot;The Renault for people who swore they would never buy another one&quot;, after the Dauphine&#x27;s disappointing reputation.

Early R10 had round headlights, but just two years after launch the 10 itself was facelifted, rectangular headlights now further differentiating it from the Renault 8. Round sealed beam headlights were maintained for the US and Canadian markets.

Alongside the Renault 10, less powerful versions of the Renault 8 continued in production at the Flins plant with the existing shorter body.

A larger unit, the 1289 cc engine from the new Renault 12, was fitted to the Renault 10 for the Motor Show in October 1970, giving birth to the Renault 10-1300. Although the engine mounted at the back of the Renault 10-1300 was in most respects identical to that fitted at the front of the Renault 12, the unit in the older car was effectively detuned, with a lowered compression ratio and a listed maximum output of SAE ( DIN) whereas the unit in the Renault 12 was advertised as providing SAE ( DIN). Renault thus offered two competing models in the same market category, but the older rear engined design came with a listed price 1,000 francs (approximately 10%) lower and a top speed of 135 km/h (84 mph) as against 145 km/h (90 mph) for the entry level Renault 12. The 1108 cc version of the engine was still offered for 1970, but now only when combined with the Jaeger &quot;button operated&quot; semi-automatic transmission which had been offered in earlier versions of the car since 1963.

===End of production===
French production of the Renault 10 ceased at the end of summer 1971, by which time the model had been selling for two years in parallel with the commercially more successful Renault 12. Although production of the Renault 10 ended in 1971, the 8 was still sold in France as late as 1973.

==Outside Europe==
===Alconi===
Through their South African subsidiary, Renault Africa Ltd, a special performance version of the Renault 10 (model 1190) was assembled at their East London assembly plant. It sold in that country only as a Renault Alconi, a combination the names of the developers, John Conchie and Eric &#x27;Puddles&#x27; Adler, who traded as &quot;Alconi Developments&quot;.

Engine upgrades resulted in 68 bhp (net) and a performance close to that of the R8 Gordini &#x27;1100&#x27; and midway between the standard Renault 8 and the 1255cc Gordini. They offered 0–60 mph in 11.9sec, top speed of 97 mph, (according to &quot;Car&quot; magazine road test) and sold for about 10% over the standard car.

It was sold new through their dealer network in South Africa and covered by their factory warranty. The local concept was intended to increase vehicle sales to a racing mad South African public by taking advantage of their race-track successes in local &quot;Sprint&quot; and &quot;Endurance&quot; races. About 400–500 vehicles (both 8 and 10) seem to have been sold. As well, many hundreds of performance kits to upgrade the standard vehicles were sold over their parts counters.

<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 421 Class was a railway locomotive, built by the CIÉ at Inchicore Works between 1962–1963 and designed for branch line traffic use and shunting.

==History==
The 421 Class was a larger development of the earlier 401 Class, and were fitted with a Maybach MD220 engine of with diesel hydraulic transmission via a Mekydro KL64U transmission. Unlike the earlier E401 class, these locomotives were fitted for multiple operation. They were of C wheel arrangement.
The first of the class made its debut in early October 1962 on pilot duties in the Dublin area and although they had a design maximum speed of , experience (notably the derailment of a trial train hauled by E421) showed that they did not ride well when travelling at speeds over and so henceforth were limited to that speed and used simply for shunting duties instead. They were numbered E421–E434, and were withdrawn from service between 1979 and 1983.

==Preservation==
Three of these locomotives have been preserved, as follows:
* E421 and E432: Owned by and based at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway, Northern Ireland. Both locos are currently stored out of traffic.
* E428 had recently moved from Inchicore Works to Dunsandle, County Galway under private ownership.

==Model==
The E421 was available as a resin model from &quot;Q Kits&quot;, but this company is no longer trading as the owner has retired.

<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 601 Class locomotives were built in 1956-1957, by Motorenfabrik Deutz at Cologne, Germany. They were 3 small shunting locomotives (601, 602 &amp; 603) of B wheel arrangement and were fitted with a Deutz V8 F8L 614 engine of 130 hp, with Voith hydraulic transmission and chain final drive. They weighed only 18 tons and had a maximum speed of . These locomotives were never fitted with train brakes, so had limited usefulness compared to their successors, the G611 class. The G601 locomotives were withdrawn from service between 1965 and 1972.

<text>Shenzhen Football Club () was a Chinese professional football club based in Shenzhen, Guangdong. Shenzhen played its home matches at the Shenzhen Universiade Sports Centre and the Shenzhen Stadium. Their majority shareholder was the Kaisa Group, a property development company which took over the club on 12 April 2016.

The club was founded on 26 January 1994, and was known as &quot;Shenzhen F.C.&quot; while they started at the bottom of the Chinese football pyramid in the third tier. After successive league title wins in the third and second tier of the professional football leagues, they were promoted to the top tier in the 1996 Chinese Jia-A League season. After only one season they were relegated, however they quickly regained promotion and started to establish themselves within the league before they won the rebranded 2004 Chinese Super League title, making them the first club to win all three divisions within the Chinese league pyramid. Since this achievement the club have struggled to match the same success and after 14 years experienced relegation to the second tier at the end of 2011 Chinese Super League season. The club dissolved after the 2023 season, on 22 January 2024.

==History==
===Early club era===
Shenzhen Football Club was founded on 26 January 1994 by former Chinese players that included Rong Zhixing and Zeng Xuelin after the Chinese Football Association had allowed full professionalism and private ownership throughout their football league system. In an attempt for the City of Shenzhen to gain their first professional football team the club decided that the best way to gain funding was through memberships that included 100 corporate members and 300 individuals before changing the ownership into shareholdings. With Hu Zhigang as their first ever head coach and with players from all over the country, the club won two consecutive promotions and championships before entering the top tier of Chinese football after only two seasons, a remarkable feat named &quot;Shenzhen speed&quot; by the locals.

The club&#x27;s first foray in the top tier, however was not a success and they were immediately relegated at the end of the 1996 campaign. In January 1997, Ping An Insurance took over the club and renamed it to &quot;Shenzhen Ping&#x27;an&quot;. With this new ownership the club immediately won back promotion to the top tier after coming runners-up within their division. Once again the team struggled with relegation, however South Korean football legend Cha Bum-Kun was appointed as the club&#x27;s first ever foreign head coach in the summer of 1998. Cha consolidated the club&#x27;s status within the top tier with two successful relegation escapes. Meanwhile, the club made a long-term combined signing of 14 hot prospects from Tianjin Locomotive&#x27;s 1st team as fresh blood, among them included future prospects Li Weifeng and Li Yi.

At the start of the 2000 season on March 27, newly appointed head coach the eccentric Brazilian Edson Tavares caught six players Peng Weiguo, Chen Yongqiang, Zhang Jun, Sun Gang, Wang Chao and Yao Li with prostitutes in the team hotel. This internal incident was leaked to the media becoming an open scandal, however the club claimed inconsistencies with the story, nevertheless the players involved had to make a public apology while the club relieved Tavares of his post as a scapegoat. General manager Zhu Guanghu took over in May and started his regime during, which Shenzhen became a major force within the league and placed fifth in 2001 before coming runners-up in 2002 (though through a joking poker sortition at a formal FA judgment process, in which coach Xie Feng picked card 6 and stated it as 9 and thus won a runner-up back for Shenzhen) their highest finish at the time.

===Jianlibao Group===
The Jianlibao Group took over the club before the 2003 campaign and renamed the club after its own brand. The club came fourth within the league and brought in major Chinese signings in Yang Chen who returned to China after spending several seasons in Germany while Zheng Bin answered the summon of Zhu, his coach back in the international youth team. These inclusions as well as the defender Zheng Zhi converted to a playmaker saw Shenzhen Jianlibao sensationally won the first ever Chinese Super League title in 2004 despite severe financial problems leaving players unpaid for seven months. By-then head coach Zhu Guanghu was subsequently awarded the coach of the year award and was appointed head coach of the Chinese national team.

The following season quickly saw the team fall from grace and they only managed a twelfth-place finish (third from bottom) in the league. The new head coach Chi Shangbin resigned after only three mouths due to his poor relationship with the squad, especially from then-captain Li Weifeng and senior players like Li Yi and Yang Chen. Chi was unhappy due to the senior players&#x27; influential control over the team, their unprofessional behavior and discipline especially with gambling. He tried to regain control of the squad with his strictness, but most of the players reacted fiercely by training and playing even more poorly. Li Weifeng punched Chi&#x27;s office window; Yang Chen, who was already a relatively gentle person got upset too and repeatedly exposed the uselessness of Chi&#x27;s policy to media, which saw the then owner Yang Saixin having to let Chi go. Both of them later infamously and sensationally labeled the troublemakers as &quot;QiuBa&quot;(Football-lord). Throughout the chaos, Shenzhen were still able to reach the 2005 AFC Champions League semi-finals after defeating Saudi Arabian side Al-Ahli despite losing the first leg in Jeddah before they were later heavily defeated by UAE champions Al Ain FC 6–0 in the semi-finals.

The following season the Jianlibao Group lacked interest and cash for investment and were taken over by the Beijing Huizhong Tianheng Investment Company. While the acquisition went through the club survived merely on sponsorship and by selling the best players off. Under domestic head coaches and youngsters from the youth teams founded back in Jianlibao era stepped up in time, and avoided relegations with help from key foreign players in Marek Zając and his compatriot Bogdan Zając. After a heavy defeat at home losing 1–4 to the champion Changchun Yatai at the last match of 2007 season, owner Yang Saixin claimed that he was &quot;fed up&quot; and wanted to sell the club. With no buyers and bids the club went into administration and it was only through their sponsorship deals and the Shenzhen Football Association keeping the club afloat. They experienced more difficulties when their head coach Mai Chao unexpectedly left after one match to join the Guangzhou Football Association and manage their youth team. Long-serving youth coach Zhang Zengqun took over, later joined by former head coach Wang Baoshan as technical consultant. With crucial goals coming from Johnson, nicknamed &quot;Angolan the Great&quot; by fans, who won the silver boot award with 13 goals; and veteran Song Lihui the club survived relegation despite a difficult start to the season.

===Wan Hongwei===
On January 21, 2009, Shenzhen F.C. was reportedly bought out of administration by a &quot;Hong Kong based investor&quot; who gained control by acquiring 51% of the club&#x27;s stock, with the remaining 49% to be transferred in the next six months for a complete takeover alongside former player Fan Yuhong who also brought in his academy at Nanshan, Shenzhen to become the club&#x27;s youth side while as well as becoming the new managerial director and acting-head coach. On February 28, 2009, Fan Yuhong revealed that the new owners of the club were two main shareholders of China Motion, a publicly listed company in Hong Kong, however these rumors were false. The reality of Shenzhen&#x27;s finances was that the club&#x27;s sponsor Shenzhen Asia Travel Sports Culture Communication Co., Ltd were acquiring the majority of the club&#x27;s shares. Meanwhile, Shenzhen were in talks with a new kit advertisement and naming right sponsor, which would help further stabilize and secure the club&#x27;s finances while the takeover finished, but only received a miner deal halfway through the season. On November 4, 2009, Wan Wongwei, a representative of a Singapore-based investment company revealed himself as the real investor and chairman of the club. With the Ruby company founded by him and other shareholders to run the club he decided to renamed the club as Shenzhen Ruby FC. Meanwhile, back on the field the team started the season slow and after a heavy 6–1 defeat to Guangzhou F.C. on August 8, Fan was sacked. Former player and coach Xie Feng was appointed as spearhead of the possible return of the legendary Zhu Guanghu, but Zhu turned to wealthier Shaanxi Chanba instead. As Xie Feng tightened the defense, and crucial reinforcements from the transfer market including Hernan Barcos, Mao Jianqing, Marko Zoric and Chen Jie, the team impressively had a 10 match unbeaten run towards the end of season and avoided relegation, despite a controversial 3-point deduction from the FA for wearing the wrong colour kit and in the subsequently delayed match versus Shanghai Shenhua.

Former Cyprus international Siniša Gogić was appointed as head coach for the 2010 season. The attacking and passionate Serbian brought a roller-coaster run combined with an unbeaten start even once reaching the top of the table, however consecutive loses saw them slide towards a relegation fight till the last match of the season. Up to eight foreign players including various internationals Chris Killen, Aleksandar Živković, Vyacheslav Hleb, Ivan Vicelich and Hussein Alaa Hussein all contributed throughout the season and saved the club from relegation for the sixth consecutive season. Off the pitch Ruby Company also announced the three years sponsorship and cooperation deal from Kweichow Moutai Company worth more than 100 million RMB. The club added &quot;Moutai&quot; in its name once again as their named sponsor.

===Philippe Troussier===
From a meeting during the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, Wan Hongwei signed former Japanese international head coach Philippe Troussier with a luxurious three-year contract under the financial sponsorship from Moutai Company. Troussier would have a difficult start to his reign when the team had to move from their home ground Shenzhen City Stadium and training ground to Huizhou Olympic Stadium because of the 2011 Summer Universiade. When the team returned to Shenzhen in their new home Bao&#x27;an Stadium, Troussier had enforced a youthful revolution within the team, however it turned out to be too radical for the club despite the refreshing ball passing and possessing tactics that they displayed and they suffered from a dreadful club-record six consecutive defeats that also included a cup tie. Despite these defeats he continued to keep faith with the youngsters and &quot;banished&quot; the mature players to the bench or the stand for various reasons. His youngsters collapsed in front of the enormous pressure and unlike in the past campaigns &quot;the relegation escapists&quot; were relegated after 14 years, making them the first professional former top tier champions to be relegated since the foundation of professional football in China.

The club kept faith in Troussier for the 2012 season in the Chinese Jia League and allowed him full influence over the squad, staff structure and pre-season arrangements, control almost unheard of with the current Chinese game. An unpromising start again quickly disappointed fans and caused further upset and conflict left behind from the previous season, which escalated in the fourth round in the league match versus Chongqing F.C. when in a local TV interview Troussier fired out against criticism and doubt from fans and urged them &quot;not to come to the game or him&quot;. Shenzhen Ruby won the match, however former players who were forced to leave by Troussier in his efforts to force youth into the team Li Fei and Chris Killen scored for Chongqing F.C. in their first return to Shenzhen and physical confrontations took place after the match among fans, staffs, players and even Troussier himself. His passing tactics lacked penetration on mediocre pitch conditions especially at away grounds and sitting back opposition. This wasn&#x27;t helped by his off the pitch eccentric personality and temperament, which alienated his relationships with the squad and staff, which was highlighted after a defeat to Chengdu Tiancheng F.C. in an August 25 game saw the club&#x27;s hopes for promotion vanish with Troussier soon afterwards providing a statement that he would take leave back to France on a &quot;regular holiday under his contract&quot;. The club&#x27;s supporters would believe the board sent him on leave hoping that the indignity would see him resign rather than compensating him the 1 Million euros per year in his contract, however he returned from his holiday despite having two of his close staff members leave and assistant manager Patrick Aussems take charge as caretaker. Upon his return the board accepted his proposal to let Aussems continue to manage first team till the end of the season, while he would go backstage for the preparation for next season.

Aussems and fitness coach Christian Jahan gave a refreshing finish of the season, earning 11 points in 7 matches, but not enough to convince the board for permanent appointment. By the end of the year, based on the fact that the board could not afford to sack but still need Troussier&#x27;s fame for media exposure and sponsor search, a new agreement with Troussier was reached by announcing his continuous management for another season and reforming the backroom as he wanted. Aussems and Jahan, who were invited in by Troussier to join him at the first place, were released after their relationship with Troussier deteriorated after caretaking the team as the board appointed during the &quot;holiday incident&quot;. Troussier brought in Eric Garcin and Rabah Ben Larbi as replacement backroom staffs. His personal assistant David Camhi also returned after an attempt of resignation during &quot;holiday incident&quot; was never accepted by the board.

===Kaisa Group===
After Philippe Troussier&#x27;s tenue came to an end and he was unable to gain promotion for the club it saw Wan Hongwei and the Ruby company actively start to pull funding from the team. This resulted in the July 15, 2014 FA Cup game against Shandong Luneng being delayed by 20 minutes while the Shenzhen players held a banner proclaiming unpaid wages from the owner. After the game in which Shenzhen lost 5–0 the club&#x27;s manager Li Yi defended his team on their actions. On January 16, 2015, the owners officially announced that they had sold-off 55 percent of the shares within the club and the club&#x27;s official name had changed to Shenzhen Municipal Football Club Co., Ltd. On October 27, 2015, Deng Junjie () and the Hong Kong Honghu Capital Group took over the club. On 12 April 2016, property development company the Kaisa Group held a ceremony to proclaim their ownership of the club.

In the 2018 China League One, the team pulled off a last-round comeback to finish second ahead of Zhejiang Greentown, who held the second place for the last 13 rounds, and earned promotion back to the top division after a 7-year absence. The team, upon promotion, though, only finished 15th out of 16th, yet were saved from relegation when Tianjin Tianhai filed for bankruptcy.

In the 2020 season, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the China Super League structure was transformed as a tournament based league. In the Dalian Division, Shenzhen FC recorded 5W-2D-7L in the division ranked 5th to get into the relegation playoff. In the first round of the relegation playoff, Shenzhen FC lost to Tianjin Teda in aggregate 1–3. In the second round of the playoff, Shenzhen FC beat Shijiazhuang Yongchang in aggregate 3–2 to avoid the relegation. In the final playoff in 2020 China Super League, Shenzhen FC beat Qingdao Huanghai in aggregate 4–1, which made Shenzhen FC finally ranked 13th in China Super League. John Mary scored 13 goals in total ranked 3rd in the top scorers following Cedric Bakambu and Paulinho.

In the first period of 2021 season, Jordi Cruyff&#x27;s team recorded 2W-2D-1L in first five games. On June 3, Shenzhen FC made an announcement that Jordi Cruyff stepped down as the head coach of the club and will work for the Barcelona. Also the same day, after a friendly negotiation, Shenzhen FC decided to hire José Carlos Granero as the head coach of the club.

On 22 January 2024, Shenzhen announced the dissolution of the club, after finishing last place in the 2023 Chinese Super League season and getting relegated back down to the second-tier.

Since 2018, the club has developed a grassroots football program aimed at improving football in the city and in young people. They developed youth teams in collaboration with the local education ministry in Shenzhen. Currently, the club has different teams of young players, from U13 to U19. The director of the youth training department was Wang Yidi. The Spanish coach, Roberto Mickel Abrante, serves as scouting director and deputy to the youth soccer department in this project.

==Kits==

When Ping An Insurance took over the club they incorporated their own logo of a giant A that emphasizes the An in their name as the club&#x27;s new badge and predominantly used green as the club&#x27;s home colours while red tops with white shorts was the preferred option for their away kits. When Jianlibao Group took over they too decided to change the club&#x27;s badge, however they decided not to use their own logo as the club&#x27;s new badge and decided to choose a new design of wings over an orange background that would also be the club&#x27;s new home colours while green was converted to their away uniforms. When the Jianlibao Group left, the club&#x27;s Chairman Yang Saixin started to make blue the club&#x27;s home colours while also changing the club&#x27;s badge, initially they were two dragons until the 2009 league season saw it changed to a bird flying over a giant football.

<text>Ferkessédougou (often shortened to Ferké) is a city in northern Ivory Coast. It is a sub-prefecture of and the seat of Ferkessédougou Department. It is also the seat of Tchologo Region in Savanes District and a commune. Ferkessédougou is the second-most populous city in northern Ivory Coast, after Korhogo.

==Regional center==
Ferkessédougou is an important centre of local development as the nearest large town on the north–south road to the main border posts for crossing into Burkina Faso and Mali. A major transport crossroads, it is home to a regional market, schools, and a hospital.

== Local economy ==
The economy of the Ferkessédougou area is overwhelmingly agricultural, with larger scale commercial farming based on huge cotton and sugarcane plantations. The city is a centre for the processing of these commodities, in particular for cattle feed, as it is a centre for stockyards of herds of zebu cattle, driven from the north, and bound for markets further south. A burgeoning tourist industry is based upon Ferkessédougou&#x27;s proximity to the large Comoé National Park (to the east) and Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve (to the west).

==Population and culture==

The dominant ethnic group in the area are the Sénoufo (primarily of Nyarafolo and Kpalaga/Palaka dialect speakers). Sociocultural organization is based on the &quot;Poro&quot;, an educational system through which every male adolescent graduates to adulthood. In the 2021 census, the population of the sub-prefecture of Ferkessédougou was 160,267.

== History ==
Ferkessédougou is situated in the heartland of the Senufo people, who migrated from the north at the time of the Mali Empire. The Senufo followed traditional African faiths, while many of the Mandinka people were becoming fervent Muslims. The Senufo were soon followed by the Dioula or Jula, a Mandinka merchant class prominent throughout West Africa. The Dioula, as they are called in Ivory Coast, reached the area and settled the nearby city of Kong in the 12th century. Despite being outnumbered by the Senufo, they prospered as traders and advisors in much of the region. In the 18th century, the Kong Empire to the east became a major regional power and dominated the Ferkessédougou area.

The town of Ferkessédougou was founded in the 19th century by Ferkessé, a Niarafola leader pushed to the west by the expansion of the Kong Empire. The name is a contraction of &quot;Ferkessé&quot;s - &quot;dougou&quot; (&quot;Village&quot; in Bambara).

At the end of the 19th century, the area fell under the control of first Samory Touré&#x27;s Wassoulou Empire and the French colonial empire. Placed under the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire Colony of French West Africa in 1895, the completed section of the planned Abidjan-Niger Railway was constructed north and ended during the colonial period at Ferkessédougou town, lending it increased regional importance. The French introduced large-scale cotton production, which remains an important pillar of the local economy.

In the late 1970s, Ferkessédougou was designated by the government as one of their regional development hubs for industry processing agricultural goods. A 50,000 ton capacity sugar processing plant was built in this period.

==Climate==
On the southern edge of the Sahel—tropical Savanna belt, Ferkessédougou gets a mean annual rainfall of 1400 mm, making it drier than much of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. It is 1037 ft-316 m in elevation.

==Transport==
Ferkessédougou is served by Ferkessédougou Airport and a station on the national railway system.

==Villages==
The 41 villages of the sub-prefecture of Ferkessédougou and their population in 2014 are.

<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 611 class locomotives were delivered from the manufacturers, Motorenfabrik Deutz at Cologne, Germany. They were delivered between December 1961 and February 1962, entering revenue earning service in the following August after receiving the new tan / black paint job at Inchicore.

==History==
Nos. 611 to 617 were a larger development of the earlier 601 class locomotives. They were fitted with a Deutz F/A8L 714 engine of , with Voith hydraulic transmission, weighed and had a maximum speed of .
They went into traffic in various parts of the country, as shunting engines at smaller depots such as Dublin&#x27;s North City Mills siding and branch line duties such as the Loughrea branch line between Attymon and Loughrea. They briefly appeared on the Limerick - Foynes mixed train service for a few months until that line was closed in 1963. Unlike the earlier 601 class, these locomotives were fitted with brake connections enabling them to work passenger trains. Apart from their use on the Foynes and Loughrea lines, they never hauled passengers until preservation in Downpatrick, where all three preserved have served on public passenger trains.

With their original lightweight branch line haunts all closed and therefore little to do, they were withdrawn from service between 1967 and 1977. Nos. 611, 613, 615, 616 and 617 were sold to Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann (Irish Sugar Co., now known as Greencore) in 1977. Four of these locomotives have been preserved, with the remainder scrapped.

==Model==
The 611 Class has been made as a 00 gauge brass kit by Worsley Works Models .

<text>Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola , also known as M. K. O. Abiola (; 24 August 1937 – 7 July 1998) was a Nigerian business magnate, publisher, and politician. He was the honorary supreme military commander of the Oyo Empire and an aristocrat of the Egba clan.

Abiola ran for the presidency in 1993, for which the election results were annulled by then military president Ibrahim Babangida. He would later die in detention after making an attempt to assert himself as the elected president. Abiola was awarded the National honour Grand Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (GCFR), an honour awarded to only Nigerian heads of state, posthumously on 6 June 2018, by President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigeria&#x27;s democracy day was changed to from 29 May to 12 June in his honour.

Abiola was a personal friend of Ibrahim Babangida and is believed to have supported Babangida&#x27;s coming to power.

Abiola&#x27;s support in the June 1993 presidential election cut across all geo-political zones and religious divisions. He was among a few politicians to accomplish such influence during his time. By the time of his death, he had become an unexpected symbol of democracy.

== Early life ==
M. K. O. Abiola was born in Abeokuta, Ogun State, to the family of Salawu and Suliat Wuraola Abiola. His father was a produce trader who primarily traded cocoa, and his mother traded in kola nuts. His name, Kashimawo, means &quot;Let us wait and see&quot;. Moshood Abiola was his father&#x27;s 23rd child, but the first of them to survive infancy, hence the name &#x27;Kashimawo&#x27;. It was not until he was 15 years old that he was properly named Moshood by his parents.

Abiola attended African Central School, Abeokuta for his primary education. As a young boy, he assisted his father in the cocoa trade, but by the end of 1946, his father&#x27;s business venture was failing, precipitated by the destruction of a cocoa consignment declared by a produce inspector to be of poor quality grade and unworthy for export and to be destroyed immediately.

At the age of nine, Abiola started his first business, selling firewood gathered in the forest at dawn before school, to support his father and siblings. Abiola founded a band at the age of 15, and would perform at various ceremonies in exchange for food. He was eventually able to require payment for his performances, and used the money to support his family and his secondary education at the Baptist Boys High School, Abeokuta. Abiola was the editor of the school magazine &quot;The Trumpeter&quot;, Olusegun Obasanjo was deputy editor. At the age of 19, he joined the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons ostensibly because of its stronger pan-Nigerian origin compared with the Obafemi Awolowo-led Action Group.

In 1960, Abiola obtained a government scholarship to study at the University of Glasgow, where he later earned a degree in accountancy and qualified as a chartered accountant. He later became a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN).

== Business career ==
In 1956, Abiola started his professional life as a bank clerk with Barclays Bank in Ibadan, South-West Nigeria. After two years, he joined the Western Region Finance Corporation as an executive accounts officer, before leaving for Glasgow, Scotland, to pursue his higher education. He received a first-class degree in accountancy from Glasgow University, and he also gained a distinction from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland. On his return to Nigeria, Abiola worked as a senior accountant at the University of Lagos Teaching Hospital, then went on to the US firm Pfizer, before joining the ITT Corporation, where he later rose to the position of vice-president, Africa and Middle East. Abiola spent a lot of his time, and made most of his money, in the United States, while retaining the post of chairman of the corporation&#x27;s Nigerian subsidiary.

=== ITT ===
While Abiola worked at the Nigerian subsidiary of Pfizer pharmaceuticals, his desire was to own some equity in the firm but the options available to him were not appealing. He then applied to a job listing seeking a trained accountant, and it was during the interview that he found out the firm was ITT Corporation. Abiola was employed by the firm and one of his immediate responsibilities was to clear the backlog of debt owed to the firm by the military. An office meeting with the army&#x27;s Inspector of Signals, Murtala Mohammed, to seek a resolution of the debts resulted in verbal argument heard by the Chief of Army Staff Hassan Usman Katsina. The intervention of Katsina ended up being favourable to Abiola, as he was given a cheque to cover the debt. Abiola used his determination to clear the debts as a bargaining tool for more role in the company; initially he was able to remove the expatriate manager but was unable to get a requested 50 per cent equity in the Nigerian arm of ITT. Abiola subsequently established Radio Communication (RCN) as a side business, new employees were trained in marketing of telecoms equipment and Abiola targeted the military who were replacing civil war-era equipment as business clients. His marketing strategy proposed training of military personnel in the use of equipment so as to reduce reliance on outside vendors for maintenance, this strategy gained favor in a security conscious armed forces. Abiola soon received a contract to supply hardware to the military that got the attention of ITT and he was offered 49 per cent equity ownership of its Nigerian arm.

RCN went on to develop a static communications network for the armed forces signal unit and Nigeria&#x27;s domestic satellite communications. In 1975, ITT and partners secured a major contract to supply automatic telephone exchanges in a number of locations within the country.

===Other ventures===

In addition to his duties throughout the Middle-East and Africa, Abiola invested heavily in Nigeria and West Africa. He set up Abiola Farms, Abiola Bookshops, Radio Communications Nigeria, Wonder Bakeries, Concord Press, Concord Airlines, Summit Oil International Ltd, Africa Ocean Lines, Habib Bank, Decca W.A. Ltd, and Abiola football club. He was also chairman of the G15 business council, president of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, patron of the Kwame Nkrumah Foundation, patron of the WEB Du Bois foundation, trustee of the Martin Luther King Foundation, and director of the International Press Institute. In 1983, he teamed up with Shehu Musa Yar&#x27;Adua, Bamanga Tukur and Raymond Dokpesi to establish Africa Ocean Lines. The firm began operations in 1984, using chartered vessels, before acquiring two cargo ships in 1986 with a capacity for 958 TEUs. The shipping firm&#x27;s route linked the major shipping ports along the West African coast with United Kingdom and Northern Europe.

== Involvement in politics ==
Abiola&#x27;s involvement in politics started early in his life when he joined the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) at the age of 19. In 1979, the military government kept its word and handed over power to the civilians. As Abiola was already involved in politics, he joined the ruling National Party of Nigeria (NPN) in 1980 and was elected the state chairman of his party. Re-election was done in 1983 and everything looked promising since the re-elected president was from Abiola&#x27;s party and based on the true transition to power in 1979; Abiola was eligible to go for the post of presidential candidate after the tenure of the re-elected president. However, his hope to become the president was shortly dashed away for the first time in 1983 when a military coup d&#x27;état swept away the re-elected president of his party and ended civilian rule in the country.

Abiola was a member of Ansar Ud Deen organization in Nigeria. In the 1980s, through his National Concord Newspaper Abiola supported Islamic causes including introduction of a Sharia Court of Appeal in Southwestern Nigeria and Nigeria&#x27;s entry to the Organization of Islamic Countries. The support given the latter received less favorable response from some readers of the National Concord. Notwithstanding, he was actively involved in the formation and activities of the National Sharia Committee. In 1984, he was given a title of Baba Adinni of Yorubaland by a committee of Muslim clerics. His support of Islam in Southern Nigeria earned him some recognition in the Northern region of the country. In his hometown of Abeokuta, Abiola built a Quran training center which was named after his mother Zulihat Abiola. After a decade of military rule, General Ibrahim Babangida came under pressure to return democratic rule to Nigeria. After an aborted initial primary, Abiola stood for the presidential nomination of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and beat Ambassador Baba Gana Kingibe and Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to secure the presidential nomination of the SDP ahead of the 12 June 1993, presidential elections. Abiola had managed to work his way out of poverty through hard work. He established Abiola bookshops to provide affordable, locally produced textbooks in the 1980s when imported textbooks became out of the reach of ordinary Nigerians as the naira was devalued. He also made available daily necessities such as rice and soap at affordable prices in the market.

==Presidential election==

=== Primaries and campaign ===
Abiola announced his candidacy for president in February 1993, this was after a previous round of presidential primaries had been cancelled by military President Babangida. His party of choice was SDP, though he was an outsider who was new to the partisan politics within the party which at the time was dominated by two major factions, People&#x27;s Front(PF) and PSP. Both SDP and its opposition, NRC held presidential primaries in March 1993. SDP&#x27;s primaries was held in Jos and was largely a three-way contest between Abiola, Kingibe and Atiku even though there were more aspirants. Abiola was heavily supported by the People&#x27;s Solidarity faction (PSP) within SDP while Atiku was supported by PF faction led by Yar&#x27;Adua and Kingibe was supported by a loose coalition of party members. During the first ballot, Abiola was able to score a slim majority vote of 3,617 to Kingibe&#x27;s 3,225. A second round was contested two days later and Abiola again emerged victorious with a slim margin and he became the party&#x27;s presidential candidate for the 12 June election.

Abiola&#x27;s political message was an optimistic future for Nigeria, with slogans such as &quot;Farewell to poverty&quot;, &quot;At last! Our rays of Hope&quot; and the &quot;Burden of Schooling&quot;. His economic policy included negotiations with foreign creditors and better management of the country&#x27;s international debts, in addition, increased cooperation with the foreign community while presenting himself as someone the international community can trust.

=== Election ===

For the 12 June 1993, presidential elections, Abiola&#x27;s running mate was his primary opponent Baba Gana Kingibe. He defeated his rival, Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. The election was declared Nigeria&#x27;s freeest and fairest presidential election by national and international observers, with Abiola even winning in his Northern opponent&#x27;s home state of Kano. Abiola won at the national capital, Abuja, the military polling stations, and over two-thirds of Nigerian states. Men of Northern descent had largely dominated Nigeria&#x27;s political landscape since independence; Moshood Abiola, a Southern Muslim, was able to secure a national mandate freely and fairly, unprecedented in Nigeria&#x27;s history. However, the election was annulled by Ibrahim Babangida, causing a political crisis which led to General Sani Abacha seizing power later that year. During preparations for the 2011 Nigerian Presidential elections there were calls from several quarters to remember MKO Abiola.

;Unofficial results
These are the unofficial results: 
==Imprisonment==

In June 1994, Abiola declared himself the lawful president of Nigeria in the Epetedo area of Lagos island, an area mainly populated by (Yoruba) Lagos Indigenes. He had recently returned from a trip to win the support of the international community for his mandate. After declaring himself president, he was declared wanted on the orders of military President General Sani Abacha, who sent 200 police vehicles to bring him into custody. His second wife, Alhaja Kudirat Abiola, was later assassinated in Lagos in 1996 after declaring public support for her husband. 

Moshood Abiola was detained for four years, largely in solitary confinement with a Bible, Qur&#x27;an, and fourteen guards as companions. During that time, Pope John Paul II, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and human rights activists from all over the world lobbied the Nigerian government for his release. The sole condition attached to the release of Chief Abiola was that he renounce his mandate, something that he refused to do, although the military government offered to compensate him and refund his extensive election expenses. For this reason Chief Abiola became extremely troubled when Kofi Annan and Emeka Anyaoku reported to the world that he had agreed to renounce his mandate after they met with him to tell him that the world would not recognise a five-year-old election.

==Death==
Moshood Abiola died unexpectedly, shortly after the death of General Abacha, on the day that he was due to be released. While meeting group of American diplomats including Thomas Pickering and Susan Rice at a government guesthouse in Abuja, Abiola fell ill and died. Rice had served tea to Abiola shortly before his collapse; despite evidence to the contrary there remains an enduring belief in Nigeria that she had poisoned Abiola.

Independent autopsy carried out and witnessed by physicians and pathologists from the Nigerian government, Nigerian Medical Association, Canada, UK and the US found substantial evidence of longstanding heart disease. General Abacha&#x27;s Chief Security Officer, Hamza al-Mustapha has alleged that Moshood Abiola was in fact beaten to death and although Al-Mustapha claims to have video and audiotapes showing how Abiola was beaten to death, he has yet to come forward with the release of such tapes or how it was procured in the first place. Regardless of the exact circumstances of his death, it is clear that Chief Abiola received insufficient medical attention for his existing health conditions.

=== Investigation ===

A number of different perspectives exist on Abiola&#x27;s death. Renowned writer and playwright Wole Soyinka in his autobiography You Must Set Forth at Dawn, categorically asserted that Abiola was presented with a poisoned cup of tea during his final interview with the BBC. He was certain about the fact that Abiola was poisoned, although information on what entities were behind the poisoning, have yet to come to light.

Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary General of the United Nations who had been in a meeting with Abiola at Abuja on 29 June 1998, mentioned that Abiola had been denied adequate medical care throughout his incarceration. This was in some corroboration with the findings of an international team of pathologists who posited a heart condition as the cause of death.

The Human Rights Violation Investigation Commission of Nigeria, conducted a series of hearings aiming to discover the truth of events leading to the Abiola&#x27;s death, concluding that the Abubakar regime probably knew more than it revealed.

== Legacy ==

Chief M.K.O. Abiola&#x27;s memory is celebrated in Nigeria and internationally. Since his death, the Lagos State Government declares 12 June as a public holiday. In 2018, other states including Ogun, Oyo and Osun, announced 12 June as a public holiday to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the annulled 1993 presidential election. 12 June remains a public holiday in Nigeria beginning 12 June 2019, it will be celebrated as democracy day, replacing 29 May. Remembrance events are arranged across Nigeria. MKO Abiola Stadium and Moshood Abiola Polytechnic were named in his honour, and there were calls for posthumous presidential recognition. A statue, MKO Abiola Statue was erected in his honour.

M.K.O. Abiola was criticised by political activists and detractors. Controversy was caused by a song by Nigerian musician, Fela Kuti, a charismatic multi-instrumentalist musician, composer and human rights activist, famed for being the pioneer of Afrobeat music and a controversial figure due to his unusual lifestyle and apparent drug use. It is believed that Kuti had entered into an acrimonious dispute relating to a contract with M.K.O. Abiola&#x27;s record label. He used the abbreviation of International Telephone &amp; Telegraph (IT&amp;T) in a song criticising big multinational corporations. The song, &quot;ITT&quot;, accuses such companies of draining Africa&#x27;s resources and says &quot;they start to steal money Like Obasanjo and Abiola&quot;.

On 29 May 2012, former president Goodluck Jonathan, announced that the famous University of Lagos will be renamed in memory of Abiola as Moshood Abiola University of Lagos (MAULAG). This received a negative reaction by both students, Alumni and members of public resulting in an abrupt reversal.

=== 12 June declared Democracy Day ===

On 6 June 2018, Muhammadu Buhari, President of Nigeria declared 12 June as the new date for the celebration of Democracy Day. Nigeria&#x27;s Democracy Day was formally celebrated every 29 May, the day in 1999 that former military Head of State, Abdulsalami Abubakar, handed over power to an elected president, Olusegun Obasanjo of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) and the date when, for the second time in the history of Nigeria, an elected civilian administration took over from a military government.

On 6 June 2018, Muhammadu Buhari in a public statement changed the Democracy Day to 12 June in honor of the 12 June 1993, presidential election and it&#x27;s winner, Moshood Abiola, who died in prison. Buhari&#x27;s statement partly read: &quot;for the past 18 years, Nigerians have been celebrating May 29, as Democracy Day. That was the date when, for the second time in our history, an elected civilian administration took over from a military government. The first time this happened was on 1 October 1979. But in the view of Nigerians, as shared by his administration, June 12, 1993, was far more symbolic of democracy in the Nigerian context than May 29 or even the October 1. June 12, 1993 was the day when Nigerians in millions expressed their democratic will in what was undisputedly the freeest, fairest and most peaceful elections since our independence. The fact that the outcome of that election was not upheld by the then military government doesn&#x27;t distract from the democratic credential of that process. Accordingly, after due consultation, the Federal Government has decided, henceforth, June 12 will be celebrated as Democracy Day. Therefore, the government has decided to award posthumously the highest honour of the land GCFR, to the late Chief M.K.O. Abiola, the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 cancelled election&quot;.

On 11 June 2019, Muhammadu Buhari assented to a Bill amending 29 May previously set aside as a public holiday for the celebration. The public holiday amendment Act was passed by the National Assembly of Nigeria following a Bill introduced and sponsored by Kayode Oladele, Human Rights Lawyer and Member of the House of Representatives ( Eighth Assembly) representing Yewa North/Imeko-Afon Federal Constituency of Ogun State.

===Babangida admits regret===

Speaking during the release of his biography in February 2025, Babangida finally expressed regret for cancelling the 1993 elections, declaring that the elections had been free and fair, and that MKO Abiola indeed won. 

 &quot;Undoubtedly credible, free and fair elections were held on 12 June 1993...However, the tragic irony of history remains that the administration that devised a near-perfect electoral system and conducted those near-perfect elections could not complete the process. ...That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret.&quot;
== Awards and honours ==

Moshood Abiola was twice voted international businessman of the year, and received numerous honorary doctorates from universities all over the world. In 1987 he was bestowed with the golden key to the city of Washington, D.C., and he was bestowed with awards from the NAACP and the King center in the US, as well as the International Committee on Education for Teaching in Paris, among many others.

In Nigeria, the Oloye Abiola was made the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, the highest 
chieftaincy title available to commoners among the Yoruba. At the point when he was elevated, the title had only been conferred by the tribe thirteen times in its long history. This in effect rendered Abiola the ceremonial War Viceroy of all of his tribespeople. According to the folklore of the tribe as recounted by the Yoruba elders, the Aare Ona Kakanfo is expected to die a warrior in the defence of his nation to prove himself in the eyes of both the divine and the mortal as having been worthy of his title.

He was posthumously awarded the third highest national honour, the Commander of the Federal Republic, in 1998.

He was also awarded the highest national honor, the Grand Commander of the Federal Republic – or GCFR – in 2018. The date of the annulled election, 12 June, was also made Nigeria&#x27;s Democracy Day.

==Personal life==
Moshood Abiola married many wives; notable among them are Simbiat Atinuke Shoaga in 1960, Kudirat Olayinka Adeyemi in 1973, Adebisi Olawunmi Oshin in 1974, Doyinsola (Doyin) Abiola Aboaba in 1981, Modupe Onitiri-Abiola and Remi Abiola. He fathered many children. In 2024, Modupe Onitiri-Abiola organized a failed coup attempt in Oyo State; the rest of the Abiola family denounced her actions.

===Philanthropy===
Moshood Abiola sprang to national and international prominence as a result of his philanthropic activities. The Congressional Black Caucus of the United States of America issued the following tribute to Moshood Abiola:

Because of this man, there is both cause for hope and certainty that the agony and protests of those who suffer injustice shall give way to peace and human dignity. The children of the world shall know the great work of this extraordinary leader and his fervent mission to right wrong, to do justice, and to serve mankind. The enemies which imperil the future of generations to come: poverty, ignorance, disease, hunger, and racism have each seen effects of the valiant work of Chief Abiola. Through him and others like him, never again will freedom rest in the domain of the few. We, the members of the Congressional Black Caucus salute him this day as a hero in the global pursuit to preserve the history and the legacy of the African diaspora.

From 1972 until his death, Moshood Abiola was conferred with 197 traditional titles by 68 different communities in Nigeria, in response to his having provided financial assistance in the construction of 63 secondary schools, 121 mosques and churches, 41 libraries, 21 water projects in 24 states of Nigeria, and he was grand patron to 149 societies or associations in Nigeria. In addition to his work in Nigeria, Abiola supported the Southern African Liberation movements from the 1970s, and he sponsored the campaign to win reparations for slavery and colonialism in Africa and the diaspora. He personally communicated with every African head of state, and every head of state in the black diaspora to ensure that Africans would speak with one voice on the issues.

<doc id="1234056" wikidata="Q5184889" url="?curid=1234056" title="Cribbs Causeway">
<text>Cribbs Causeway is both a road in South Gloucestershire, England, running north of the city of Bristol, and the adjacent area which is notable for its out-of-town shopping and leisure facilities. The retail and leisure complex takes its name from the road, and includes retail parks, supermarkets, an enclosed shopping centre known as Cribbs, an ice-rink, Vue, a cinema, 
Hollywood Bowl, a ten-pin bowling venue, and a gym.

The Cribbs Causeway road is a historic route, as it follows a section of a Roman road from Sea Mills to South Gloucestershire, part of a longer Roman route from Gloucester to the south-west of England. The modern road of that name is situated north of Bristol, and west of the town of Patchway, in the civil parish of Almondsbury. It runs approximately north-east from the northern edge of Bristol at Henbury, to a point just beyond the M5 motorway (at junction 17), and forms parts of today&#x27;s A4018 and B4055 roads. It is one of the primary access routes from Bristol to the Cribbs Causeway retail and leisure complex; other primary access routes being the M5 motorway itself, and the Hayes Way link to the A38.

The Hazel Brook rises at Cribbs Causeway, flowing southwards through Blaise Castle estate, before joining the River Trym.

==History==
Cribbs Causeway is believed to be the route of a Roman road from Sea Mills to Gloucester, part of a longer Roman route from Gloucester to the south-west of England. It later became the route of a turnpike from Bristol to New Passage. In the 20th century it was part of the main road from Bristol to the Aust Ferry, until the Severn Bridge opened in 1966. In the early 1960s it was upgraded to an A road (the A4018), and linked with the New Filton Bypass to the A38 north of Patchway. In 1971 the New Filton Bypass was incorporated into the M5 motorway, and the motorway junction transformed the area. In 1976 Carrefour was granted planning permission to build a hypermarket (now the Asda store) near the junction. Development of retail parks followed, and in 1998 the Mall was opened.

The road has been said to owe its name to Tom Cribb, a bare-knuckle boxer from the Bristol area. However, this was proven wrong in the 1960s with the discovery of a map showing the current name, published in 1777: four years before the boxer was born. The book&#x27;s author goes on to speculate that the true origin of the name may be from &quot;Crybe&#x27;s dwelling&quot; (&quot;Crybe&quot; being a personal name), or from &quot;crib&quot; – a manger or hovel. But all that we can truly glean from this is that the causeway — the Roman road — was named for a family with the surname Cribb (which may or may not have been closely related to the boxer&#x27;s family: he was from Hanham on the opposite side of Bristol). This local family was probably also commemorated in the smallholding called &quot;Crybescroft&quot; which existed in Henbury in 1281.

==Shopping and leisure==

===Cribbs===
Cribbs (formerly known as The Mall at Cribbs Causeway) comprises 130 shops on two levels, although some of the large stores occupy more levels. Major stores include anchor-tenants John Lewis and Partners and Marks &amp; Spencer, plus Boots, H&amp;M, Next, River Island. During 2013, the centre housed the Gromit Unleashed Exhibition and Store and also hosted the charity auction that took place after the arts trial had concluded. Global corporations can also be found in Cribbs and include retailers such as Apple and Polestar. The food court is located on the upper level and is home to various chain outlets such as: Burger King, Chopstix, Pizza Hut, Nando&#x27;s, Krispy Kreme and others.

At its centre point, Cribbs has a large fountain with a water display. Money thrown into the fountain is donated to local charities, the company reports it raises in excess of £10,000 a year for local charities. The fountain has many copper pipes that pump water out in repeated patterns and either into the middle, or towards the middle, where another pipe shoots water high into the air every 5–10 minutes at approximately . The height of the water jet is adjustable to prevent any object, hanging from above, from getting wet; additionally there are also a few other decorative fountains outside the main entrance.

To celebrate The Mall&#x27;s tenth anniversary, the company announced a five million pound refurbishment of the food court, completed in two stages with completion in May 2009.

As of 2018, Cribbs is owned by M&amp;G Real Estate.

The primary access routes are the M5 Junction 17, Hayes Way to the A38 and A4018. The Mall is one of the major shopping centres in the Bristol area, the others being Broadmead (the location of The Galleries, Bristol) and Cabot Circus.

Nearby is Centaurus Retail Park containing B&amp;M, Carpetright, Dreams, Go Outdoors, Halfords, Hobbycraft, HomeSense, Tapi Carpets and T.K. Maxx.

===Other stores===
Other large stores include the United Kingdom&#x27;s first Asda Walmart Supercentre, which was originally built by the French hypermarket chain Carrefour in the late 1970s. Then when Carrefour pulled out of the UK it sold all of its stores, including the Bristol hypermarket, to the Dee Corporation which owned the Gateway store chain. Then Gateway sold all of its large format stores to Asda in 1989, and it became an Asda hypermarket. Then after the sale of Asda by its management to Walmart in July 1999, it became the first Asda Wal*Mart Supercentre in July 2000. The store has since had yet another major refurbishment and has been rebranded as an Asda Supercentre and the Walmart branding has been removed. This is also the location of the first Morrisons supermarket in the south west of England which opened in September 2003. There is also a B&amp;Q DIY store which also houses a Furniture Village, DFS, Makro and Wickes.

On Hollywood Lane, which passes under the M5 motorway, is the Cribbs Business Centre. Lysander House is located on Lysander Road on the site of the former Harry Ramsden&#x27;s restaurant. A Bang &amp; Olufsen store is located on Cribbs Causeway. Topps Tiles and Porcelanosa are located on Lysander Road. Miller &amp; Carter Steakhouse, is also located on Cribbs Causeway. Redwood Farm, a Farmhouse Inns pub, is located on Catbrain Lane, next to Lysander House. IN&#x27;n&#x27;OUT Autocentre is situated behind Morrisons.

===Cribbs Venue===
Cribbs Venue (formerly known as The Venue at Cribbs Causeway) is an entertainment complex featuring an ice-rink, a 12 screen Vue cinema, a ten-pin bowling alley (run by Hollywood Bowl), an Anytime Fitness gym, and eateries including Bella Italia, Burger King, Chiquitos, Nandos, Frankie &amp; Benny&#x27;s, KFC, Las Iguanas, PizzaExpress and T.G.I. Friday&#x27;s.

==== Ice-rink ====
An international standard permanent indoor ice-rink opened at Cribbs Causeway in October 2021, in a purpose-built facility with a capacity for 1,300 spectators. Run by Planet Ice, and branded as Planet Ice Bristol, it is the first permanent ice-rink in the area since the former Bristol Ice Rink closed in 2012. Planet Ice Bristol is the new home of the Bristol Pitbulls ice hockey team.

Prior to the opening of Planet Ice Bristol, Cribbs Causeway has hosted pop-up outdoor ice-rinks in winter seasons.

==Car Dealerships==
The Cribbs Causeway area has become the home to many car dealerships in recent years these include: Aston Martin, Audi, BMW, Ford, Honda, Mercedes-Benz/Smart, Mini, Nissan, Peugeot, Porsche and Tesla. Rybrook Holdings opened a large showroom containing Bentley, Lamborghini, McLaren and Rolls-Royce vehicles in 2016. There was also a pop up Tesla Motors store on the upper floor of The Mall, occupied by BMW over the 2014-2015 Christmas break, and again until May when preparations began for a permanent location directly above the old store. A Jaguar Land Rover dealership has also opened, just across from Planet Ice Bristol.

==Hotels==
There is currently two hotels in the area. Mollies and A Travelodge is located on Cribbs Causeway, behind the Miller and Carter Steakhouse. Soho House have planning permission for a 123-room hotel on the site of the former Cribbs Lodge Hotel. There had been a Premier Inn on Catbrain Lane. On 17 July 2019 it was destroyed by a fire which caused part of the building to collapse onto Cribbs Causeway. It took nearly 48 hours to extinguish the flames. On 26 May 2020, Premier Inn’s parent company, the Whitbread Group, announced that they had secured planning permission to re-build, reusing the old building’s footprint but with an additional storey for a below-ground car park. Construction work on the new building had started, and was completed in 2021. An investigation into the incident was unable to find its cause, due to extensive fire damage and the building’s subsequent demolition.

==Transport==
The Mall has over 7000 parking spaces spread over a car park that is divided into different sections, and which is free to use. There are also large car parks at the retail parks and supermarkets.

===Bus station===
The station is situated at The Mall and has 8 stands. The bus station (the terminal for many bus routes) which is served by a considerable amount of bus services operating in Bristol, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. Buses run from the bus station around the Bristol area and as far afield as Chepstow, Gloucester and Newport. The WESTlink on-demand bus, is available to the public Monday-Saturday.

===Railway station===
The area is not served by a railway station. The nearest, Patchway, around to the west. There are plans to re-open the nearby Henbury Loop Line to serve both the Cribbs Causeway area and the future development on the Filton Airfield site.

==Progress of expansion==
In October 2014, plans to expand the shopping centre were revealed to the public in a public exhibition, including a 120-bed hotel, a new bus station, a multi-storey car park, a pedestrian link bridge over Merlin Road and 150 apartments, with the proposed expansion to increase the shopping centre by more than a half. Construction work was expected to start in 2017 and anticipated to open by 2021. After deferring the Mall&#x27;s £300 million expansion plan in February 2016, South Gloucestershire Council approved the plans in November 2016.

=== Sports facilities ===
Plans to build an ice rink, dry ski-slope, and indoor &quot;ski-diving&quot; facility were presented to the public in June 2015, with the &quot;Bristol Post&quot; reporting that the planning request was placed on 9 December 2015, with the intended site being next to the &quot;Vue&quot; cinema. On 7 April 2017 architects &quot;Atkins Walters &amp; Webster&quot; reported that South Gloucestershire Council had approved the leisure development plans, which comprised &quot;an ice rink, a sky-dive and ski centre, a hotel, a drive-thru coffee shop, retail, a restaurant and a car showroom&quot;, with the intention of including a &quot;green corridor that enables future provision of the proposed pedestrian bridge to link to an expanded Mall Shopping Centre&quot;. &quot;Atkins Walters &amp; Webster&quot; stated their &quot;key aim is to create a permeable layout that links the Filton Airfield site to the wider Cribbs Causeway network&quot;.

In July 2019, the &quot;Bristol Post&quot; reported that plans for a dry-ski-slope facility had been &quot;shelved&quot;, as the company due to deliver it, &quot;Skiplex&quot;, had gone into administration – and the developers were focusing on delivering the new ice rink.

The ice-rink opened on 25 October 2021, after some delay caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is the new home rink of the Bristol Pitbulls ice hockey team, who played their first game at the rink on 30 October.

<text>The Córas Iompair Éireann 501 Class locomotives were built in 1955 by Walker Brothers of Wigan for use on the narrow gauge () lines on the West Clare section of the CIÉ. They were small diesel mechanical locomotives, with a 0-4-0+0-4-0 wheel arrangement. Controlled from a central cab, the locomotives had two Gardner engines of , one under each end casing, driving through a fluid coupling and Wilson gear box the inner axle of the opposite bogie, through a spiral-bevel-reverse and reduction gear box. Unusually the locomotives were driven from a seat mounted sideways to the direction of travel giving a clear field of vision both ways by a mere turn of the head.

The locomotives were fitted with vacuum brakes, emergency braking coming from a &quot;deadman&#x27;s&quot; pedal, one at the driving position and two others, one mounted on each side of the cab. 
When used on freight services their maximum speed was , but with an overdrive fitted, released by a key, this was raised to for passenger trains.

==History==
They were originally numbered C31-C33 in the West Clare steam locomotive series, but were subsequently renumbered into the diesel locomotive series as F501-F503. They were withdrawn in 1961 when the West Clare lines were closed and stored at Inchicore Works for seven years. The Isle of Man Railway made an offer for the locomotives which was rejected by CIÉ, who subsequently made less money by selling them for scrap in 1968.

The Walker 501 Class has been made as a 00n3 scale 12mm gauge brass kit by Worsley Works Models

<text>Georges Leclanché (9 October 1839 – 14 September 1882) was a French electrical engineer chiefly remembered for his invention of the Leclanché cell, one of the first modern electrical batteries and the forerunner of the modern dry cell battery.

==Biography==
Leclanché was born in 1839 in Parmain (Seine-et-Oise), France, the son of Léopold Leclanché and Eugenie of Villeneuve. Due to the political situation in France, and because his father was a former minister, his parents, also friends of the writer Victor Hugo, decided to take the way of exile in the United Kingdom. He was thus educated in England but completed his education at École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures (École Centrale Paris), one of the top engineering schools in France, graduating in 1860 to begin work as an engineer. He first worked for a French railways company where he was in charge of communication infrastructures related to the electrical transmission of time. His interest for the development of efficient electrical cells arose from the problems affecting the existing generation of cells used at this time in the railways. Because of the political situation in France, he emigrated in Brussels in Belgium where he built a small laboratory. It is there that he developed a first cell based on copper carbonate and then his electrical cell based on zinc reducing agent and manganese oxide oxidizing agent. His invention was rapidly adopted by the Belgian telegraph administration and the railways company of The Netherlands.

After the fall of Napoléon III, he came back in France in Paris where he became associated with Ernest Barbier to found the cells factory &quot;Leclanché-Barbier&quot;. He was the main manufacturer of cells in France. Georges Leclanché died from a throat cancer on 14 September 1882 in Paris around the age of 43.

After his death, his brother Maurice took over the business and his son Max also continued to improve and to commercialise his invention.

==Leclanché cell==
In 1866 he invented the Leclanché cell, one of the first electrical batteries and the forerunner of the modern dry cell battery. It comprised a conducting solution (electrolyte) of ammonium chloride with a negative terminal of zinc (anode/oxidation) and a positive terminal of manganese dioxide (cathode/reduction).

Leclanché&#x27;s &quot;wet cell&quot; (as it was popularly called) was the forerunner to the world&#x27;s first widely used battery, the zinc–carbon battery.

In 1876, Leclanché jellifies the electrolyte of his cell by adding starch to the ammonium chloride, making his cell more portable.

==Leclanché company==
The Leclanché factory successfully developed until the beginning of the 20th century when it encountered the concurrence of many new producers such as the Wonder cells (founded in 1914). The enterprise changed several times of hands, was bought by the Fulmen battery company and finally by the CGE group.

The name Leclanché is presently used by a company based in Yverdon in Switzerland and founded in 1909. In 2006, this company acquired the German society Bullith which became the &quot;Leclanché Lithium GmbH&quot;, based today in Willstätt (Baden-Württemberg in Germany).

==Trivia==
* Rue Georges Leclanché, a street in Paris, is named after him

<text>Kim Jaewon (born 18 February 1981) is a South Korean actor. He is best known for the television dramas &quot;Romance&quot; (2002), &quot;Listen to My Heart&quot; (2011), &quot;May Queen&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Scandal&quot; (2013).

==Career==
Kim Jaewon made his acting debut in 2001 in the sitcom &quot;Honey Honey&quot;. He rose to stardom a year later when he played a high school senior who falls for his teacher (played by Kim Ha-neul) in 2002 hit drama &quot;Romance&quot;. &quot;Rival&quot; (with So Yoo-jin) and &quot;My Love Patzzi&quot; (with Jang Na-ra and Kim Rae-won) further raised his profile.

He reunited with &quot;Rival&quot; costar Kim Min-jung in &quot;Land of Wine&quot; (2003), where they played a young couple trying to revive traditional liquor amidst a family feud. Then in 2004, he starred opposite Sun Feifei in &quot;Beijing My Love&quot;, a South Korean-Chinese co-production which was shot 80% in China. He also appeared in the romantic comedy film &quot;100 Days with Mr. Arrogant&quot;, followed by a supporting role in &quot;My 19 Year Old Sister-in-Law&quot;.

In &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; (2005), Kim&#x27;s character deals with the consequences of a one-night stand in Singapore that leads to young marriage (to Eugene) and fatherhood. After playing a third-rate gangster who inherits a kindergarten and falls for a teacher (played by Han Ji-min) in &quot;Great Inheritance&quot; (2006), Kim was cast in his first period drama role as a nobleman romantically involved with a gisaeng in &quot;Hwang Jini&quot; (previous &quot;Mr. Arrogant&quot; costar Ha Ji-won played the title role). With his Korean Wave appeal, Kim then filmed the Chinese television drama &quot;First Love&quot;, which aired on CCTV in 2008.

Kim enlisted on March 23, 2009 to fulfill his mandatory military service, and was assigned to the Defense Media Agency. He was discharged on January 24, 2011.

As his acting comeback, Kim joined the cast of &quot;Listen to My Heart&quot;, for which he received praise for his portrayal of a deaf man. He and costar Hwang Jung-eum were later given recognition at the year-end MBC Drama Awards.

In fall 2011, Kim signed on to star in &quot;Me Too, Flower!&quot; opposite Lee Ji-ah. But on the first day of filming on October 4, he was injured when the moped he was riding malfunctioned and accidentally accelerated. After being diagnosed with a dislocated shoulder, bone fracture and torn ligaments and cartilage, he withdrew from the drama and was replaced by Yoon Shi-yoon. Kim cancelled all entertainment activities for ten months and underwent rehabilitation under Dr. Na Young-mu (well known as the doctor of figure skater Yuna Kim), eventually making a full recovery.

In 2012, Kim returned to the small screen opposite Han Ji-hye in &quot;May Queen&quot;, which depicts the success stories of people in the shipbuilding industry. He later won the Top Excellence Award in a Serial Drama at the MBC Drama Awards (he also hosted the ceremony). Kim was also the MC of &quot;Get It Beauty HOMME&quot;, a &quot;beauty guide for men&quot; on cable channel OnStyle.

Though he initially became popular due to his fair skin and beaming smile (which earned the actor the somewhat feminine nickname of &quot;smiling angel&quot; among fans), in recent years Kim has cultivated an image as a tough guy. This physicality was showcased in his next drama, &quot;The Scandal&quot; (2013), where he played a detective who discovers that the man he considers his father had kidnapped him as a child from his biological family.

In 2014, Kim joined &quot;Four Sons and One Daughter&quot;, a reality show with four male celebrities and one female guest star who form a family while living with fake parents in the countryside. He also began hosting the current affairs program &quot;The Real Story Eye&quot;, which reconstructs cases to uncover the facts beneath rumors and speculation. Later that year, he signed with a new talent agency, Will Entertainment.

Kim returned to period dramas in 2015 with &quot;Splendid Politics&quot;, playing a villainous King Injo.

In &quot;God&#x27;s Quiz: Reboot&quot;, he played the role of a lunatic Hyeon Sang-pil, continuing a diverse and wide acting transformation.

In 2020, he established a one-man entertainment agency with his manager, who he has been working with for 20 years. The company is based on trust and people.

==Personal life==
Kim married Park Seo-yeon (who was three months pregnant at the time) on June 28, 2013 at Raum Wedding Hall in Yeoksam-dong, Seoul. The couple were childhood friends who began dating in October 2012. Park is the daughter of the head of an advertising agency, and she works in management at a modeling agency. Their son Yi-jun, nicknamed &quot;Heaven,&quot; was born in December 2013. Yi-jun appeared on camera for the first time when his father made a guest appearance on &quot;Stars&#x27; Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant&quot;.

<doc id="1234079" wikidata="Q1306530" url="?curid=1234079" title="A Night in Casablanca">
<text>A Night in Casablanca is a 1946 American comedy film directed by Archie Mayo and starring the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo, and Chico). The screenplay was written by Joseph Fields and Roland Kibbee. It was an independent production released by United Artists. The cast also features actress and singer Lisette Verea. The villain is portrayed by Sig Ruman, who had roles in the earlier Marx Brothers films &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; (1935) and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot; (1937).

==Plot==
Set in Casablanca shortly after World War II, escaped Nazi war criminal Heinrich Stubel has steadily murdered three managers of the Hotel Casablanca. Disguised as a Count Pfefferman, Stubel&#x27;s goal is to reclaim the stolen art treasures that he has hidden in the hotel. However, the only way he can do this undetected is by murdering the hotel&#x27;s managers and running the hotel himself.

The newest manager of Hotel Casablanca is former motel proprietor Ronald Kornblow, who is very much unaware that he has been hired because no one else will dare take the position. Inept Kornblow takes charge of the hotel, and eventually crosses paths with Corbaccio, owner of the Yellow Camel company, who appoints himself as Kornblow&#x27;s bodyguard, aided and abetted by Stubel&#x27;s valet Rusty. In his many efforts to murder Kornblow, Stubel sends beautiful Beatrice Reiner to romance the clueless manager.

As manager, Kornblow allows Rusty to make a roulette bet (three 5s in a row) that could bankrupt the hotel. Rusty wins and Stubel uses this convince the Governor and police to arrest Kornblow, Corbaccio and Rusty on conspiracy. Stubel is then appointed hotel manager.

Kornblow, Corbaccio and Rusty are thrown in prison. Rusty reveals he found the treasure earlier and all three men, plus hotel secretary Annette, break out of prison to try and stop Stubel from leaving with the treasure.

Before Stubel can make his escape to the airfield with the loot, Kornblow, Corbaccio, Rusty and Beatrice invade his hotel room and sneak from suitcase to closet and back again to unpack his bags, which serves to drive him thoroughly mad. Stubel flees the hotel, but Kornblow, Corbaccio and Rusty follow and crash Stubel&#x27;s plane into a police station where the brothers expose Stubel as an escaped Nazi.

==Legal stunt==
A popular story (spread in part by Groucho himself) surrounding the movie is that the Marx Brothers were threatened with a lawsuit by Warner Bros. for the use of the word &quot;Casablanca&quot; in the film&#x27;s title due to it being an infringement on the company&#x27;s rights to the 1942 film &quot;Casablanca.&quot; Groucho responded with a letter asserting that he and his siblings had use of the word &quot;brothers&quot; prior to the establishment of Warner Brothers (and many others had before that), and often the story is told that Groucho threatened a counter-suit based on this assertion. He also mentioned that he would consider further legal action by pointing out to Warners that the title of their current hit film &quot;Night and Day&quot; infringed on the titles of two Marx Brothers films released by MGM: &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;.

The true story is that the original storyline for the film was intended to be a direct parody of &quot;Casablanca,&quot; with the characters having similar-sounding names to the characters and actors in the 1942 film. Groucho Marx said that an early draft named his character &quot;Humphrey Bogus&quot;, a reference to the leading actor in &quot;Casablanca,&quot; Humphrey Bogart. Warner Bros. did not litigate, nor threaten to litigate. However, the studio issued a formal inquiry to the Marx Brothers concerning the plot and script of the film

The Marx Brothers exploited the situation for publicity, making it appear to the public that a frivolous lawsuit was in the works, and Groucho sent several open letters to Warner Bros. to get newspaper coverage. These letters were among those he donated to the Library of Congress, and he reprinted them in his 1967 book &quot;The Groucho Letters&quot;. There is no evidence that Warner Bros. ever responded to any of Groucho’s letters.

Producer David Loew told the Hollywood Reporter that he had reach an arbitration agreement with Warner Bros. to use the title &quot;Adventures in Casablanca.&quot; The film was eventually retitled &quot;A Night in Casablanca.&quot; The Brother&#x27;s publicized the name change and released advertisements with a list of different &quot;Casablanca&quot; titles such as &quot;&#x27;It Happened One Night in Casablanca&#x27; or Anything the Mayors of Casablanca Warner Brothers will permit.&quot;

Ultimately, the matter ended without legal action, and the storyline of the film was changed to be a send-up of the genre rather than &quot;Casablanca&quot; specifically.

== Production ==
The movie was shot under the title &quot;Adventures in Casablanca&quot; before being renamed &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot;. Some exterior scenes were shot in Palms Springs, California.

<doc id="1234083" wikidata="Q482491" url="?curid=1234083" title="Hyundai Atos">
<text>The Hyundai Atos () is a city car that was produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai from 1997 until 2014. It was also marketed under the Atoz, Amica and Santro model names. From 1999, the Atos with a different rear fascia and restyled rear side doors is marketed as the Atos Prime and in South Korea and Indonesia as the Kia Visto. It has been available only with a five-door hatchback body style.

It was replaced in most markets by the i10 in 2007, but production continued in India until late 2014. The Santro nameplate, used in India, was revived in October 2018.

==Overview==

===Debut of original Atos===
The development project for a Hyundai minicar started in October 1995 after the main Korean competitor Daewoo had already put in place the production of a compact car, exposing numerous concepts in various international car showrooms that would have foreshadowed the production model (which would become the Matiz designed together with Italdesign Giugiaro). Hyundai produced a concept of a city car which was extremely compact and economical to sell not only in South Korea but also in Europe (market with high sales in the city segment seen the successes of cars such as Fiat Panda, Cinquecento, Renault Twingo and Peugeot 106) and in India. In just 23 months, with a total investment of 155 million dollars, the car passed from the blank sheet to production. In September 1997, Hyundai released it as the Atos, less than 3.50 meters long, characterized by a soft design but a very spacious interior thanks to the shape of the mini-van body, five doors and five seats. At the debut the engine was a four-cylinder petrol 800 cc Epsilon that was approved according to the new restrictive emission standards entered into force in South Korea. For export markets, the Atos adopted a larger 1.0-litre four-cylinder Epsilon engine.

Production in the Ulsan plant (South Korea) started in September 1997. The European version was presented at the International Motor Show Germany in Frankfurt the same month and sales began in March 1998.

Hyundai for the Atos created a specific base platform, very simple in the mechanical and economic setting to produce because the car had to be sold in emerging markets and therefore have a low price list: the front wheel drive scheme was adopted, with MacPherson front suspension, and a torsion-beam suspension at the rear, front disc brakes and rear drum brakes. The design of the Atos is characterized by a front with circular headlights and bumpers in raw plastic, the rear lights are in an upright position near the rear window, and the tailgate is very large to facilitate access to the luggage compartment. 

The Atos was one of the first compact city cars (A-segment) to be sold in Europe with the five-door body. The trunk has a volume of 263 liters that rise to 1064 by breaking down the back sofa. The dashboard had a simple design, with a large shelf in the dashboard in front of the passenger side and two central vents with the levator climate controls. Safety devices (driver and front passenger airbags and ABS) were paid or standard only on top models.

===Introduction of Atos Prime (1999–2003)===
In India, the Atos Prime was adapted to local tastes and launched under the name Hyundai Santro, with production starting in October 1998. The bodywork was completely redesigned by lowering the roof by 4.5 centimeters and redesigning the tail with new lights, tailgate and bumpers (which were available in body color). The nose remained similar to that of the previous Atos, but the grille was changed and made available with chrome plating. The interior remained the same. At that time, Hyundai had acquired a majority share in fellow Korean manufacturer Kia and implemented a revitalization program that included sharing engines and platforms. The car was presented at the Busan Motor Show on 17 May 1999 as the Kia Visto, to be sold in Europe through the Kia sales network, alongside the old Atos that would remain in production and be sold by Hyundai dealerships. However, European Hyundai dealers opposed the decision to distribute the Visto as the car would have caused competition for the Atos; Hyundai thus renamed the car Atos Prime at the end of 1999, and positioned it as a more highly equipped model to complement the Atos, which remained in production, updated with new lights, bumpers and interior materials.
In South Korea and Indonesia, the Atos Prime was sold as the Kia Visto as originally planned, while the Atos remained in production, sold by Hyundai dealers. 

Compared to the original Atos, the Prime had a less spacious interior but better aerodynamics due to the lower roof. The trunk was smaller, with capacity reduced to 219 litres up to a maximum of 889 liters with the rear seats reclined. The 1.0 litre petrol engine remained.

In December 1999, the Atos Prime was introduced in Europe, while in the same month the Atos underwent a slight facelift.

In September 2001, there was a further facelift to both the Atos and Atos Prime, with new headlights and bumper, and new tail lights for the Atos Prime. New interior upholstery also featured.

===Second facelift (2003–2014)===
Introduced in September 2003, the new version had an entirely new nose and tail, with new headlights, bonnet and bumper, in a more angular style. A new hatch and tail lights completed the rear. Only the doors, side panels and interior of the old Atos Prime were retained. It is also known as Santro Xing in India. 

A new engine replaced the old Epsilon four-cylinder 1.0 (and the 0.8 Epsilon sold only in Asia). The new Epsilon 1.1 four-cylinder 12-valve engine delivered , 5 more than the previous 1.0. The gearbox remained the five-speed manual, with a four-speed automatic option.

In 2005, there was a slight facelift that introduced a new fascia and wheel designs. In addition, the engine in Europe was updated to the Euro 4 standard and the power rose to 63 horsepower.

==Other names==
The Atos Prime is marketed as the:
*Hyundai Amica in the United Kingdom
*Hyundai Santro Xing in India
*Atos by Dodge in Mexico
*Kia Visto in Indonesia and South Korea (Hyundai also sold the original Atoz in Indonesia).
*Inokom Atos in Malaysia
*Hyundai Santro in India and Pakistan

The original Atos was sold under the Hyundai brand but rebadged as the Atoz (or &quot;AtoZ&quot;) in some markets, including the United Kingdom. The Hyundai Santro is a rebadged version of the city car Hyundai Atos sold in some Asian markets.

The Kia Visto is a rebadged Hyundai Atos Prime.

==Markets==

===India===
Hyundai entered the Indian market in 1997 with the Atos, marketed under the name &quot;Santro&quot;. Hyundai derived the name Santro for the Indian market from Saint-Tropez, a French city famous for fashion, because the company wanted to project it as a ‘fashionable’ car. Produced at Hyundai&#x27;s factory in Chennai, its primary competitor at that time was the popular Maruti Suzuki Zen. The distinctive styling of the first generation had mixed reviews, but the car was a success primarily due to its power steering feature and price.

In the years since, the Indian version has undergone a number of upgrades in styling and technology to respond to consumer preferences. In 2003, the first generation (Zip) was replaced with the second generation Atos Prime, marketed in India as the &quot;Santro Xing&quot;, which enjoyed great sales success. The car was also exported from India in large volumes to the Asia and Oceania region.

In its final few years, Santro had become a popular option as a hatchback taxi, and the car was still selling close to 30,000 units per year when Hyundai made the decision to discontinue production.

;Variants in India
The Hyundai Santro was first released in India in 1998. It came with three variants:
* Santro base, with AC and black bumpers, priced at 2,99,000 INR ex-showroom
* Santro DX 1, added with front power windows, central locking, high quality fabric upholstery a fabric inserts on door trims, body colored bumpers, rear wiper/washer/defogger, front fog lamps, waistline moulding and full wheel covers, priced at 3,49,000 INR.
* Santro DX 2, added with power steering and first in class rear seat belts, priced at 3,69,000 INR. These were often criticised for their appearance.
* In 2000, a new version called Santro Zip Drive was introduced. Changes included were things such as every variant got a power steering and a new grille.
* In 2002, a refreshed version called Santro Zip Plus was introduced. Changes included Clear Lens headlamps and taillamps and a better engine and performance.
* In 2003, the car underwent a complete facelift and was introduced as the Santro Xing. Pictures are given below alongside technical data.

===Pakistan===
The Santro was launched in Pakistan in 2000. It was discontinued in 2013.
===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, the Hyundai Atoz and Kia Visto was launched in 2000 with the 1.0-litre G4HC engine and initially sold as a complete built-up unit from South Korea (Atoz) and India (Visto). In 2001, Hyundai began production of the Atoz as a complete knock-down unit, which were assembled by Hyundai Mobil Indonesia in Bekasi, West Java, while the Visto continued to be imported from India. The Atoz and Visto received an update in 2002 with crystal multireflector headlamps and tail lamps. The Atoz received a redesigned front mesh grille. In 2004, the Visto was replaced by the Picanto. In June 2005, the Atoz received a facelift with the new Atos Prime front while maintaining the original Atos rear, and the engine was replaced with the 1.1-litre G4HG engine with multi-point fuel injection (the same engine as the Picanto). The Atoz was discontinued in 2008 and replaced by the i10 in March 2009.

The Atoz was available in two trim levels: the base GLX and higher-level GLS, while the Visto was available in Que trim, and later replaced with the zipDrive trim in 2002.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, the Hyundai Atos is locally assembled by Inokom carrying the badge Inokom Atos. The Inokom Atos Prima was later introduced in 2006 which has the new Atos Prime front while maintaining the original Atos rear.

<doc id="1234104" wikidata="Q7969407" url="?curid=1234104" title="Warheads (comics)">
<text>Warheads was a Marvel UK comic book series which ran for 14 issues in the early 1990s (January 1992–May 1993) and was followed by the two-issue mini-series &quot;Warheads: Black Dawn&quot;. The stories contained in the comic were also serialised in the UK comics anthology &quot;Overkill&quot;. The Warheads were mercenaries employed by the nefarious and Faustian Mys-Tech organisation to capture advanced technology or mystical artifacts from alien worlds, time periods, or other dimensions.

The book had guest appearances, such as the X-Men, Silver Surfer, Mephisto, X-Force, and agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. It features many backup &#x27;flashback&#x27; stories.

==Publication history==
Paul Neary was instrumental in creating the whole Mys-Tech concept for Marvel UK, including the original Warheads outline. The characters in &quot;Warheads&quot; were first visualised by artist Gary Erskine with the first scripts for the strips provided by Nick Vince, followed by John Freeman and Craig Houston, who is now a computer game scriptwriter whose credits include &quot;Call of Duty 3&quot;.

Unlike most of the other Marvel UK titles tied into the Mys-Tech concept, the Warheads were not enemies of Mys-Tech—instead, they were portrayed as expendable soldiers employed by a callous corporation. They did, eventually, turn against Mys-Tech, having had enough.

Other &quot;Warheads&quot; artists included Simon Coleby, Dave Taylor, Stuart Jennett, and Charlie Adlard. Mark Harrison painted an unpublished spin-off, called Loose Cannons, available online, about the all-female Virago Troop (Holly, Elan, Nix (who is killed and replaced with the genetically enhanced Lamia, a creation of Dr. Oonagh Mullarkey), team psychic Syster Sphynx, and team leader Bodecia &quot;Bo&quot; Kildare) and provided &quot;Warheads&quot; several covers for &quot;Overkill&quot;.

==Fictional team biography==
The Warheads find themselves in a seemingly abandoned Australian town. Liger, the leader, realizes he is on the &#x27;downside&#x27; of a time loop, where the team has not gone to other dimensions or other planets, but back in time on Earth. A subtle memory indicates three of his team must die and Liger realizes he must allow this to preserve the timeline. The town belongs to the X-Men and three of his team members do indeed die in battle with Wolverine. Liger&#x27;s first step towards rebellion is taken when his bosses say the loss of three Warheads is worth the information they ultimately stole from the X-Men.

The story then focuses on Leona McBride, a rookie brought in to replace one of the dead members slain by Wolverine. Her first mission involves exploring an alien spaceship. Leona is distressed when it seems one of her newfound friends vanishes and dies but he turns up alive, as Iron Man had been impersonating him. Later, the Warheads fight S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives, X-Force, and the X-Men again and deal with their boss gaining vast, cosmic powers. With X-Force, it ends up being that the women of the team have to save the day, as the men (on both sides) are transforming into powerful beasts. The Warheads women are assisted by Feral, who gains vast powers due to magical influence.

The troops also struggle with the bureaucratic processes of their bosses. For example, Gregory is fined for screaming during a simple nightmare.

Again and again, Liger sees new recruits and troop replacements die and he is angry that they do not seemingly receive enough training. Some die during training, which is that much more frustrating to him.

Gregory is recruited for a side-mission by one of his bosses in an attempt to slay Mephisto. For his effrontery, he is merged with a demon. The team would confront Mephisto again when they travel to his realm to &#x27;rescue&#x27; the source of Misha&#x27;s precognitive voices. This would turn out to be Mephisto&#x27;s son Blackheart. While Gregory finds the other half of his body and slays the demon, the Troop loses Perez.

===Rebellion===

In the &quot;Mys-Tech Wars&quot; series, the troop is sent to a mystical copy of Earth, which was created by their bosses to gain control of the real Earth. They fight the cyborg Death&#x27;s Head and encounter a lost little girl. In a bit of magic which saves their lives, the girl is overcome by the stress and dies. This is the last straw for the troop, who rebel with the aid of Death&#x27;s Head. Ultimately the troop escapes control, having discovered a way to travel through dimensions. Unfortunately, the first trip takes them to a world populated by vampires, where Leona and another member die. Though the troop escapes this world, their ultimate fate is unknown.

===Revolutionary War===

The team were key players when Mys-Tech were defeated in the Battle of London Bridge - the organisation had tried to buy off Mephisto by sending all of Britain to Hell, and Liger&#x27;s rebel Warheads went into the infernal realm to shut down the portal. They were betrayed by Gregory and forced to remain in Hell to succeed, and Kether Troop forced Liger back to Earth. He spent the next few years as a traumatized, homeless alcoholic separated from his gun Clementine.

When Mys-Tech returned, S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s European Division head Keller brought Liger back in from the cold and tasked him to dig up intelligence. Keller turned out to be possessed by Mys-Tech&#x27;s old Psycho-Wraith Prime, and Liger had been brought in just to find Warhead&#x27;s old Master Key, so the Key could be forced to open a portal for Mephisto&#x27;s armies; Psycho-Wraith Prime taunted Liger that S.H.I.E.L.D. simply hadn&#x27;t cared enough to bring him back before or find his lost troops. However, the wounded Liger was able to help free some of Prime&#x27;s captured superheroes and helped gun down Mephisto&#x27;s general Killpower, saving the world. Afterward, he disappeared with the now-cured Keller on a trip to Hell to find Kether Troop.

==Warheads Kether Troop==

===Colonel Tigon Liger===

The comic focused on the Kether Troop led by Colonel Tigon Liger, whose most notable feature was prominent facial scarring from being slashed by Wolverine. He carried a very large semi-intelligent gun named Clementine that, while helpful to the troop, sometimes endangered them when Liger&#x27;s orders were unclear. The creators of Warheads named Colonel Liger after two hybrid animals; a tigon is a crossbreed between a male tiger and a female lion crossbreed, a liger being its reverse.

===Other members===
The membership varied over the course of the series, with frequent inclusion of trainee characters, new recruits, or &quot;loaner&quot; members from other Troops, who usually died in the course of action (like redshirts on Star Trek). In rough sequential order, the Kether Troop included:

Issue 1:
*Stacy Arnheim (in charge of troop defence and who was normally depicted wearing a large exoskeleton of combat armour)
*Cale (a retriever and expert at scavenging; Col. Liger&#x27;s lover, killed in the first story)
*Corey (technician, killed in the first story)
*Draft (described as a hit-man, killed in the first story)
*Gregory (hit-man, replacement for Draft) 
*Johnny Heaven (technician, replacement for Corey, killed by Leona in issue #2)
*Leona McBride (retriever, replacement for Cale, turned into a vampire at the end of &quot;Warheads: Black Dawn&quot; #2)
*Misha (a Psi-Scout, with precognitive abilities)
*Perez (the troop medic, killed in issue #10)

Issue 3:
*Chalmers (new recruit, killed)
*Grierson (technician, on loan from Ubu Troop)
*Peters (new recruit, killed)
*Samuels (new recruit, female retriever, killed)

Issue 6:
*Athena (killed)

*Desmond (killed)

Issue 9:
*Bell (on loan from another troop)
*Jenna (troop defence, on loan from another troop)
*Moxham (technician, on loan from another troop)
*Ross (killed)

Issue 12:
*Connor (trainee, killed)
*Dreyfus
*MacManus (trainee, killed)
*Martinez (new recruit, killed)
*O&#x27;Leary (new recruit, killed)
*Sapperstein (new recruit, killed)

Issue 13:
*DeCosta (medic, killed in &quot;Warheads: Black Dawn&quot; #1)
*Duncan (new recruit, technician)

Other series:
*Desdemona
*Evone
*Prizzi

==Other Warheads troops==

*Omega Troop
*Gevurah Troop
*Virago Troop

The names of the original Warheads troops are a direct reference to the names of the 10 Sephiroth emanations of God in the Kabbalah. This is known to be a direct reference, as the Warheads were originally depicted as entering wormholes on a model of the cabalistic Tree of Life, and they entered the wormhole where the Sephiroth Kether is situated. Significantly, &quot;Kether&quot; is the Sephiroth at the top of the tree of life and &quot;Kether&quot; means &quot;crown&quot;. &quot;Kether&quot; also is the Sephiroth closest to God and represents ultimate goodness.

The Kether Troop eventually showed their goodness by turning upon the evil Mys-Tech organisation. Several other troops did not—Omega, Gevurah, and a replenished Malkuth Troop were all specifically named as fighting for Mys-Tech until the end (and taking part in “the genocide on Lionheart”) in the Revolutionary War comics.

Later troops, including Omega, Virago, and Ubu, are not named after a Sephiroth.

==Headquarters==

The Warheads&#x27; base of operations was Mys-Tech&#x27;s subterranean headquarters deep beneath the Museum of Pagan Antiquities, Canary Wharf, London, England and they traveled to other planets, time periods, locations, or dimensions by means of unstable wormholes opened by Mys-Tech&#x27;s techno-wizards.

<doc id="1234112" wikidata="Q342680" url="?curid=1234112" title="Aleksandr Mostovoi">
<text>Aleksandr Vladimirovich Mostovoi ( ; born 22 August 1968) is a Russian former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.

Known as &quot;O Zar de Balaídos&quot; (&quot;The Tsar of Balaídos&quot;) from his lengthy spell at Celta de Vigo, he was often referred to as a &#x27;genius playmaker&#x27; during his time there, in addition to a volatile temperament. He also played professionally in his own country, Portugal and France.

Mostovoi earned 50 caps for Russia in a 12-year international career, being chosen for two World Cups and as many European Championships. He previously represented the Soviet Union and the CIS.

==Club career==
===Spartak and first abroad spell===
Born in Lomonosov, Russia, Soviet Union, Mostovoi signed for national giants FC Spartak Moscow from second division club FC Presnya Moscow, quickly making an impression. In January 1992, he joined compatriots Vasili Kulkov and Sergei Yuran at S.L. Benfica; months before arriving, he was controversially awarded Portuguese citizenship through marriage, but never imposed himself in the first team.

Midway through 1993–94 Mostovoi joined Ligue 1 side Stade Malherbe Caen, then left after the sole season to fellow French side RC Strasbourg, rejoining coach Daniel Jeandupeux. With the latter, he first displayed glimpses of an emerging talent.

===Celta===
Mostovoi&#x27;s big break came when he signed for Celta de Vigo in 1996, for 325 million &quot;pesetas&quot; (about €1.95 million). He made his debut for the Galicians in a 2–0 home defeat against Real Betis, and his creative play and key goals made him a cult figure at Balaídos as the club rose to near the top of La Liga standings year after year.

Affectionately nicknamed &#x27;The Tsar of Balaídos&#x27; by the fans, Mostovoi formed an impressive midfield society with, amongst others, compatriot Valery Karpin, and helped Celta win the 2000 UEFA Intertoto Cup; the final was a 4–3 aggregate win over his hometown club FC Zenit Saint Petersburg. However, he could not help the freefall that hit the team in the 2003–04 season, relegating it to the second division after the player appeared in a career-worst (in his Celta career) 24 matches. His top-flight tally of 235 games for Celta was a club record until Hugo Mallo broke it in 2021.

===Alavés===
Having not played for over eight months, and at the age of 36, Mostovoi signed a contract with Dmitry Pietrman&#x27;s Deportivo Alavés in early March 2005, initially until the end of the second level campaign. His first and only game came in a league game against Cádiz CF in which he came on as a substitute, in the 78th minute – he scored the Basques&#x27; only goal (and nearly added a second) in an eventual 1–3 defeat.

Having been with the club for only 30 days, Mostovoi told the club directors of his intention to retire claiming he was suffering from back problems.

==International career==
Mostovoi played for the Soviet national team, the CIS and Russia internationally. In another temper tantrum, he was sent home by team manager Georgi Yartsev during the latter&#x27;s trip to UEFA Euro 2004, after questioning his methods. He played in the Euro 1996 and the 1994 FIFA World Cup and was also picked for the 2002 World Cup, but did not play in the latter tournament due to injury.

Mostovoi&#x27;s exclusion from Euro 2004&#x27;s national squad happened after the 0–1 group stage loss to Spain. Supposedly, the player talked with the media after the match and gave an interview saying that Yartsev was not a good coach and did not understand anything. This was later proven false, after Mostovoi gave another interview and explained he merely said that Yartsev overworked the players during practice, so they didn&#x27;t have the necessary energy to play well in matches. All in all, group morale dropped after the incident, and Russia lost the second game to hosts Portugal.

In 2009, Mostovoi was part of the Russia squad that won the Legends Cup.

== Style of play ==
A talented attacking midfielder, Mostovoi was known for his technical ability as well as his temperamental character. A quick, agile, creative, and mobile advanced playmaker, Mostovoi was also tactically versatile, and capable of playing in several midfield and offensive positions. His preferred position was in a free role as a classic number 10, but he was also used in central midfield and as a winger on occasion. Mostovoi was renowned in particular for his first touch and speed on the ball, as well as his timing, interpretation of space and dribbling skills, which enabled him to get past defenders; he was also highly regarded for his vision and precise passing. Capable of both scoring and assisting goals, he had a penchant for scoring goals from distance.

== Retirement ==
After retiring as a player, in 2005 Mostovoi was persuaded by the then Russian Tennis Federation president Shamil Tarpishchev to play for the Russia national beach soccer team.

Mostovoi has repeatedly stated his desire and willingness to lead a football club as a manager. However, Mostovoi does not have the necessary UEFA coaching licences, which he does not want to obtain. Since 2011, he has expressed various versions of this decision: from doubts about obtaining new knowledge in coaching courses to corrupt schemes to obtain this licence by other specialists.

==Personal life==

Mostovoi graduated from college as an electrician, and later joined a sports academy in Moscow, which provided coaching to young players with a university education.

After losing the 2001 Copa del Rey Final, a group of Celta supporters raised four million pesetas to commission a statue of Mostovoi. The player approved and Maxín Picallo was chosen as the sculptor, but the project was never finished; he believed that his dip in form in 2003 affected enthusiasm in the endeavour.

He was in a relationship with Stéphanie, whom he met in Strasbourg. The couple have two children, Alexander (born 1996) and Emma. His son of the same name, known by the hypocorism &quot;Sacha&quot;, trialled with S.L. Benfica B in 2016.

<text>&quot;One weekend a month, two weeks a year&quot; is a former recruiting slogan used by the U.S. Army National Guard. It indicated the amount of time an individual would need to spend actively in the Guard to be a Guardsman with benefits. Though never officially, it was also informally used by Air National Guard, U.S. Army Reserve, U.S. Naval Reserve, U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, U.S. Air Force Reserve and U.S. Coast Guard Reserve personnel in describing their similar military time commitment. 

It was dropped during the Iraq War after it became clear that National Guardsmen and Reservists were now serving considerably more time in service, especially on active military duty on extended overseas deployments in the Southwest Asia combat zone.

==Usage of the slogan==
The slogan &quot;one weekend a month, two weeks a year&quot; has been most commonly seen by Americans in recruiting ads for the National Guard, especially in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Although the slogan is only sometimes used directly in advertising, it was used to describe the duties of at least some military posts.
The slogan has also been used to contrast the commitment that a National Guard member would give during those times when his country was not at war. 

Other Reserve and National Guard forces have used this slogan as something against which they can contrast their own dedication,
 showing that, as members of combat aviation units or special forces, they are not mere &quot;weekend warriors&quot;.

==Understanding among the enlisted==
Understanding the meaning of the slogan to those enlisted in the National Guard requires understanding the historical context in which it was given. During World War II, the National Guard was called up to defend their country, and this was repeated in the Korean War even when American soil was not directly threatened. At this time, joining a reserve component could clearly be seen as a route to service overseas. However, at the time of the Vietnam War, President Johnson made it clear that the National Guard&#x27;s role was to defend the country and not to be involved in overseas adventures. At the time, this meant that those who joined the force could be fairly sure of not seeing action in the war, and became a pejorative term. 

As a result, the term &quot;weekend warriors&quot; was coined by members of the United States Armed Forces and the general public, as the National Guard service was seen as cushy and easy compared to those in active duty. This perception was reinforced by the abysmal performances from the National Guard in notable events such as the 1967 Detroit riot and the 1970 Kent State shootings, where the guardsmen were criticized for inadequate riot training and lack of combat experience that resulted in casualties/damages far exceeding their intended goals.
These forces are expected to act as a second line of defense, primarily motivated by the fact that they are defending their own homes and families.

The commitment to Iraq and more recently, subsequent engagements, conflicts, and operations (primarily, and more specifically; those related to the Global War on Terrorism) has meant that many members of the National Guard feel the terms in which they understood their recruitment have been breached. The slogan has now become known in a changed form, &quot;One weekend a month, my ass&quot;, as a comment on the perceived mistreatment of the National Guard and the Reserve.

==Real service requirements contrasted to expectations==
During some periods of the 2003 war in Iraq, the National Guard (Army National Guard and Air National Guard) represented 41% of all U.S. military personnel deployed. The majority are supposed to serve for six months or a year. However, some specialists in the reserve forces have been required to serve for up to two years.

In the meantime, the role of the National Guard which, in the Vietnam War, largely revolved around home defense and policing, has changed so that in Iraq &quot;about 20 percent of the U.S. military deaths in that conflict&quot;
 have been carried by Reserve and Guard units.

It has been claimed in the U.S. media that the change in expectations on the National Guard is a deliberate change in policy by military planners in response to the Vietnam War. The need to use the National Guard is designed to reduce the possibility of &quot;half-hearted&quot; wars in future. Actual legal changes were made by the US Congress and in the 1980s which moved final decision for their use as military forces from their commanders in chief, the state governors, to the federal government. These new laws were successfully defended against challenges from state governors in the U.S. Supreme Court. 
==Army&#x27;s future annual drill plans==
In July 2012, the Chief of Staff of the Army, General Ray Odierno, indicated that he intended to change the Army National Guard&#x27;s annual peacetime active duty commitment from two weeks per year to up to seven weeks per year, in addition to the weekend a month, which would not change. The changes come as the Army plans to reduce the number of full-time soldiers, and going forward relies increasingly on the Army National Guard. &quot;How do we sustain the readiness and experience that we&#x27;ve gained in the National Guard and Reserve component?&quot; Odierno asked. &quot;That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been working on.&quot;
==Other usages==
&quot;One weekend a month, two weeks a year&quot; was also formerly used as a descriptor in television advertisements for the Australian Army Reserve.

<text>Rush to Judgment: A Critique of the Warren Commission&#x27;s Inquiry into the Murders of President John F. Kennedy, Officer J.D. Tippit and Lee Harvey Oswald is a 1966 book by American lawyer Mark Lane. It is about the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy and takes issue with the investigatory methods and conclusions of the Warren Commission. The book&#x27;s introduction is by Hugh Trevor-Roper, Regius Professor of History at the University of Oxford. Although it was preceded by a few self-published or small press books, &quot;Rush to Judgment&quot; was the first mass market hardcover book to confront the findings of the Warren Commission.

The title of the book was taken from Lord Chancellor Thomas Erskine&#x27;s defense of James Hadfield, who had attempted to assassinate King George III in 1800. According to Alex Raskin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;&quot;Rush to Judgment&quot; opened the floodgate for Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories&quot;.

Bertrand Russell, who is thanked in the acknowledgements section of the book for being &quot;kind enough to read the manuscript and make suggestions&quot;, set up the &quot;Who Killed Kennedy? Committee&quot; in response to the book. This committee, in Russell&#x27;s words, was set up &quot;for the purpose of making known the material [Lane] has uncovered and his further findings&quot;. Arnold J. Toynbee is also thanked in the acknowledgements section for the same reason.

==Contents==
===&quot;Rush to Judgment&quot;===
&quot;Rush to Judgment&quot; became a number one best seller and spent 29 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list. Lane questions, among other things, the Warren Commission conclusion that three shots were fired from the Texas School Book Depository and focuses on the witnesses who had recounted seeing or hearing shots coming from the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza. Lane questions whether Oswald was guilty of the murder of policeman J.D. Tippit shortly after the Kennedy murder. Lane also states that none of the Warren Commission firearm experts were able to duplicate Oswald&#x27;s shooting feat.

According to former KGB officer Vasili Mitrokhin in his 1999 book &quot;The Sword and the Shield&quot;, the KGB helped finance Lane&#x27;s research on &quot;Rush to Judgment&quot; without the author&#x27;s knowledge. The KGB allegedly used journalist Genrikh Borovik as a contact and provided Lane with $2,000 for research and travel in 1964. Mark Lane called the allegation &quot;an outright lie&quot; and wrote, &quot;Neither the KGB nor any person or organization associated with it ever made any contribution to my work.&quot;

==Documentary==

In 1967, a documentary film based on Lane&#x27;s book was directed by Emile de Antonio and hosted by Lane. Some of the assassination witnesses who present their observations on-camera include Nelson Delgado, James Tague, Charles Brehm, Mary Moorman, Lee Bowers, Sam Holland, Jim Leavelle, James Simmons, Richard Dodd, Jessie Price, Orville Nix, Patrick Dean, Napoleon Daniels, Nancy Hamilton, Joseph Johnson, Roy Jones, Harold Williams, Penn Jones, Jr. and Acquilla Clemons.
