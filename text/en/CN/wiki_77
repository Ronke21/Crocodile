<doc id="1256769" wikidata="Q232660" url="?curid=1256769" title="Arina Tanemura">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist, illustrator, and character designer. She made her professional manga debut in 1996 with the one-shot &quot;The Style of the Second Love&quot; in the &quot;shōjo&quot; manga magazine &quot;Ribon Original&quot; and later published her first series, &quot;I.O.N&quot;, in 1997, in the main &quot;Ribon&quot; magazine. She gained mainstream popularity from the late 1990s to mid-2000s with her series &quot;Phantom Thief Jeanne&quot;, &quot;Full Moon o Sagashite&quot;, and &quot;The Gentlemen&#x27;s Alliance Cross&quot;.

Throughout her career, Tanemura&#x27;s work has been recognized in &quot;shōjo&quot; manga for her art style and themes of young girls transforming into the women they would like to become. In addition to her publications, Tanemura has released two independent studio albums of songs based on her characters and is the character designer for &quot;Idolish7&quot; and other media projects.

==Early life==
Arina Tanemura was born on March 12, 1978. Tanemura grew up in Aichi Prefecture. Her main source of entertainment was manga magazines because her local television stations only ran re-runs of older anime series, and she was unable to watch new shows. When she was in nursery school, her mother would often buy manga magazines aimed at an older female demographic, such as &quot;Bessatsu Margaret&quot;, &quot;Bessatsu Friend&quot; and &quot;Bessatsu Shōjo Comic&quot;. Her older brother, on the other hand, often read &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump&quot;. While in elementary school, Tanemura&#x27;s friend lent her a copy of &quot;Ribon&quot;, and she became fascinated with its childish art style, later convincing her mother&#x27;s co-worker to buy her a copy. Throughout elementary school, she also read &quot;Margaret&quot; regularly, and she began reading &quot;Shōjo Comic&quot; in junior high school.

Tanemura began drawing at the age of 5. She was heavily influenced by &quot;shōjo&quot; manga works from her childhood, and she mostly drew female characters. She started drawing manga beginning in spring break of her first year in high school, during which she stated she made her first submission to an amateur manga contest. At the same time, her female cousin had expressed interest in reading a story about a character Tanemura had drawn for her multiple times. Tanemura described her submission as a &quot;dark&quot; and &quot;sad&quot; story about the main character&#x27;s boyfriend dying in a traffic accident and later being approached by his brother. Despite not winning, she later stated that she had passed the first round and earned from the contest. Afterwards, she began practicing by drawing &quot;yonkoma&quot;.

==Career==

===1996–1998: Debut and early fame===

Tanemura debuted professionally at the age of 18 in 1996. Her debut work was a short comic titled &quot;The Style of the Second Love&quot;, which was published in the &quot;shōjo&quot; manga magazine &quot;Ribon Original&quot;. Despite being published in a sister magazine of the main &quot;Ribon&quot;, Tanemura stated that the story received positive feedback, and that she received 500 fan letters after it was serialized. The comic, along with her other short works, was later reprinted in the anthology &quot;Short-Tempered Melancholic&quot;. In 1997, Tanemura released &quot;I.O.N&quot;, her first series.

===1998–2011: Mainstream popularity===

From 1998 to 2000, Tanemura worked on &quot;Phantom Thief Jeanne&quot;. &quot;Phantom Thief Jeanne&quot; was successful, selling a cumulative total of 5,500,000 print copies. After &quot;Phantom Thief Jeanne&quot; ended, Tanemura followed up with &quot;Time Stranger Kyoko&quot;, but because the protagonist&#x27;s &quot;strong personality&quot; failed to appeal to the editors and reader demographic, she was forced to end it after a year with 12 chapters. From 2002 to 2004, Tanemura worked on &quot;Full Moon o Sagashite&quot;, a story centered on an idol singer. Tanemura, having once wanted to become a lyricist, created the series out of a desire to write lyrics. Due to the negative feedback from &quot;Time Stranger Kyoko&quot;, this time, she gave the protagonist a subdued personality.

The popularity of &quot;Phantom Thief Jeanne&quot; and &quot;Full Moon o Sagashite&quot; led both works to receive television anime adaptations. &quot;Time Stranger Kyoko&quot; also received an anime adaptation and was screened as a short film at the 2001 Ribon Festival. For &quot;Full Moon o Sagashite&quot;, Tanemura also recorded a cover version of Changin&#x27; My Life&#x27;s &quot;Smile&quot; titled &quot;Smile (Arina&#x27;s Vocal Version)&quot;, which was released on the soundtrack album &quot;Full Moon o Sagashite: Full Moon Final Live&quot;.

In 2004, Tanemura published &quot;The Gentlemen&#x27;s Alliance Cross&quot;, which ran in &quot;Ribon&quot; until 2008. Unlike her previous series, &quot;The Gentlemen&#x27;s Alliance Cross&quot; contained no fantasy elements. She provided the voice for Maora Ichinomiya and the Postman for the limited edition drama CD. Afterwards, she published &quot;Mistress Fortune&quot;, making her the first artist who ended and debuted a new series in the same issue of &quot;Ribon&quot;. Tanemura wrote &quot;Mistress Fortune&quot; as a &quot;middle school romance&quot; and intentionally made the story more light-hearted compared to &quot;The Gentlemen&#x27;s Alliance Cross&quot;. Later in 2008, she launched &quot;Sakura Hime: The Legend of Princess Sakura&quot;.

From 2008 to 2009, Tanemura hosted her own online radio program, &quot;Tanemura Arina de Kyan: Manga Seminar&quot;, on Niconico Douga. To commemorate the 15th anniversary of her debut, Tanemura released an independent album titled &quot;Junai Tenshi&quot; on December 29, 2010, at Comic Market 79 under the circle name &quot;Meguro Teikoku&quot;, with songs based on ten of her main female characters from her previous works. The album features vocals and lyrics from Tanemura, and she performed several songs live during her autograph event at Animate on March 6, 2011. While she had written lyrics to songs before, the CD project had come from her desire to write lyrics without having them altered by professional lyricists. After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Tanemura contributed to a &quot;dōjinshi&quot; anthology with other manga artists that was sold for charity efforts. From July to November 2011, she launched &quot;Fudanjuku Monogatari&quot; in &quot;Margaret&quot;, a manga adaptation featuring fictional portrayals of the idol girl group Fudanjuku. Tanemura had decided to draw the manga after they had expressed interest in cosplaying as her characters.

===2011–present: Departure from &quot;Ribon&quot;, &quot;Idolish7&quot;===

Beginning in May 2011, to celebrate Tanemura&#x27;s 15th debut anniversary, Shueisha began reprinting &quot;I.O.N&quot;, &quot;Phantom Thief Jeanne&quot;, &quot;Time Stranger Kyoko&quot;, and &quot;Full Moon o Sagashite&quot; in &quot;bunkoban&quot; format. In November 2011, Tanemura ended her exclusive contract with &quot;Ribon&quot; to work freelance, her last work with the magazine being &quot;Sakura Hime: The Legend of Princess Sakura&quot;, which concluded in 2012. Following her announcement, Shueisha reprinted her short comics from 2001 to 2010 in the anthology &quot;Tanemura Arina: Ren&#x27;ai Monogatari-shū&quot;, which included a previously unpublished 6-page story.

Tanemura wrote and illustrated &quot;Neko to Watashi no Kinyōbi&quot;, which ran in &quot;Margaret&quot; from 2013 to 2015. At the same time, she also started serializing &quot;Idol Dreams&quot; in Hakusensha&#x27;s &quot;Melody&quot; magazine. For the limited edition character song CD released with volume 3 of &quot;Idol Dreams&quot;, Tanemura wrote the lyrics to the song &quot;Sakura-iro Time Trip.&quot; On March 23, 2013, Tanemura released her second album, &quot;Princess Tiara&quot;, on an independent record label, composed of theme songs performed by her based on her characters.

In 2015, Tanemura contributed character designs to the game and media project &quot;Idolish7&quot;. In addition, Tanemura provided illustrations to the novel and manga adaptations. She also contributed colored illustrations to the &quot;Touken Ranbu&quot; anthology, &quot;Touken Ranbu Gakuen&quot;. From 2015 to 2016, Tanemura briefly released &quot;dōjinshi&quot; as Meguro Teikoku. In October 2015, Tanemura collaborated with Yui Kikuta, one of her former assistants, to create the manga series &quot;Shunkan Lyle&quot;, which ran in &quot;Monthly Comic Zero Sum&quot;. From 2016 to 2017, she published the series &quot;Akuma ni Chic × Hack&quot; in &quot;Margaret&quot;. In 2019, to celebrate her 20th anniversary, Animate hosted a collaboration café from September 5 to 24 featuring food based on characters from her original series published with Shueisha.

==Artistry and themes==

Tanemura said she drew influences from &quot;shōjo&quot; manga from her childhood, particularly comedy stories such as &quot;Tokimeki Tonight&quot; and &quot;Chibi Maruko-chan&quot;, and she drew according to trends she believes were fashionable, resulting in her current art style. Tanemura stated that her art style is not derived from specific artists, and that she has been drawing in the same style since she was young, but has since then cited Hayao Miyazaki, Rumiko Takahashi, Kei Kusunoki, Yuu Watase, and Fumiko Tanikawa as people who have personally inspired her. In addition, Tanemura also cited Hideaki Anno as an influence, having watched his works during the second half of her &quot;&quot;otaku&quot; phase&quot;. Tanemura intended to draw in a style that makes her works difficult to animate. While her earlier works had thicker and harsher lines, she described her artwork in 2017 as becoming more soft and flowy. Tanemura also primarily draws artwork without the use of digital tools and she illustrates using Dr. Ph. Martin coloring ink. The clothing featured in her works are inspired by clothing that she personally owns.

A common theme in Tanemura&#x27;s &quot;shōjo&quot; manga works are female characters who transform back and forth between the young girls they are and the women they would like to become, and she drew &quot;Phantom Thief Jeanne&quot;, &quot;Full Moon o Sagashite&quot; and &quot;The Gentlemen&#x27;s Alliance Cross&quot; specifically to exaggerate how girls want to become mature. Tanemura drew a reversal of this theme for &quot;Idol Dreams&quot;, where the main protagonist transforms into the young girl she had wanted to be, to appeal to fans who had grown up with her work.

The influence of idol singers is another theme present in Tanemura&#x27;s works. Tanemura, a fan of Hello! Project groups such as Morning Musume and Berryz Kobo, had modeled the protagonist of &quot;Full Moon o Sagashite&quot; using then-Morning Musume member Ai Kago&#x27;s corkscrew hairstyle. &quot;Idol Dreams&quot; is also centered on an idol singer, but Tanemura drew influences from older magical girl idol series like &quot;Creamy Mami&quot; and &quot;Fancy Lala&quot;. Tanemura stated that she is also a fan of Fudanjuku and actively follows their career; she is friends with the group&#x27;s members and wrote the manga &quot;Fudanjuku Monogatari&quot; based on their stage personas.

Referring to &quot;Full Moon o Sagashite&quot; and &quot;The Gentlemen&#x27;s Alliance Cross&quot;, Tanemura disclosed that her main female characters and their relationships are based on her friends or stories she has heard from them. She stated her stories were not meant to deliver a specific message to young women and that they were for everyone to enjoy. Her favorite of her works is &quot;The Gentlemen&#x27;s Alliance Cross&quot;.

<doc id="1256774" wikidata="Q538677" url="?curid=1256774" title="Angevin Empire">
<text>The Angevin Empire (; ) was the collection of territories held by the House of Plantagenet during the 12th and 13th centuries, when they ruled over an area covering roughly all of present-day England, half of France, and parts of Ireland and Wales, and had further influence over much of the remaining British Isles. It may be described as an early example of a composite monarchy. The empire was established by Henry II of England, who succeeded his father Geoffrey as Duke of Normandy and Count of Anjou (from the latter of which the term &quot;Angevin&quot; is derived). Henry married Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1152, acquiring the Duchy of Aquitaine, and inherited his mother Empress Matilda&#x27;s claim to the English throne, succeeding his rival Stephen in 1154. Although their title of highest rank came from the Kingdom of England, the Plantagenets held court primarily on the continent at Angers in Anjou, and at Chinon in Touraine.

The influence and power of the Angevin kings of England brought them into conflict with the kings of France of the House of Capet, to whom they also owed feudal homage for their French possessions, bringing in a period of rivalry between the dynasties. Despite the extent of Angevin rule, Henry&#x27;s son John was defeated in the Anglo-French War (1213–1214) by Philip II of France following the Battle of Bouvines. John lost control of most of his continental possessions, apart from Guyenne and Gascony in southern Aquitaine. This defeat set the scene for further conflicts between England and France, leading up to the Hundred Years&#x27; War (1337-1453), in which the Plantagenet, for a time, would re-establish dominion over much of western, central and northern France, before losing their possessions again, this time permanently.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Angevin Empire&quot; is a neologism defining the lands of the House of Plantagenet: Henry II and his sons Richard I and John. Another son, Geoffrey, ruled Brittany and established a separate line there. As far as historians know, there was no contemporary term for the region under Angevin control; however, descriptions such as &quot;our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be&quot; were used. The term &quot;Angevin Empire&quot; was coined by Kate Norgate in her 1887 publication &quot;England under the Angevin Kings&quot;. In France, the term (French for &quot;Plantagenet area&quot;) is sometimes used to describe the fiefdoms the Plantagenets had acquired.

The adoption of the &quot;Angevin Empire&quot; label marked a re-evaluation of the times, considering that both English and French influence spread throughout the dominion in the half-century during which the union lasted. The term &quot;Angevin&quot; itself is the demonym for the residents of Anjou and its historic capital, Angers; the Plantagenets were descended from Geoffrey I, Count of Anjou, hence the term. The demonym, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, has been in use since 1511.

The use of the term &quot;Empire&quot; has engendered controversy among some historians over whether the term is accurate for the actual state of affairs at the time. The area was a collection of the lands inherited and acquired by Henry, and so it is unclear whether these dominions shared any common identity and so should be labelled with the term &quot;Empire&quot;. Some historians argue that the term should be reserved solely for the Holy Roman Empire, the only Western European political structure actually named an empire at that time, although Alfonso VII of León and Castile had taken the title &quot;Emperor of all Spain&quot; in 1135. Other historians argue that Henry II&#x27;s empire was neither powerful, centralised, nor large enough to be seriously called an empire. Furthermore, the Plantagenets never claimed any sort of imperial title as implied by the term &quot;Angevin Empire&quot;. However, even if the Plantagenets themselves did not claim an imperial title, some chroniclers, often working for Henry II himself, did use the term &quot;empire&quot; to describe this assemblage of lands. The highest title was &quot;king of England&quot;; the other titles of dukes and counts of different areas held in France were completely and totally independent from the royal title, and not subject to any English royal law. Because of this, some historians, such as W. L. Warren, prefer the term &quot;commonwealth&quot; to &quot;empire&quot;, emphasising that the Angevin Empire was more of an assemblage of seven fully independent, sovereign states loosely bound to each other, only united in the person of the king of England.

==Geography and administration==

At its largest extent, the Angevin Empire consisted of the Kingdom of England, the Lordship of Ireland which was considered illegitimate since Henry II broke the treaty of Windsor, the duchies of Normandy (which included the Channel Islands), Gascony and Aquitaine, as well as of the counties of Anjou, Poitou, Maine, Touraine, Saintonge, La Marche, Périgord, Limousin, Nantes and Quercy. While the duchies and counties were held with various levels of vassalage to the king of France, the Plantagenets held various levels of control over the Duchies of Brittany and Cornwall, the Welsh princedoms, the county of Toulouse, and the Kingdom of Scotland, although those regions were not formal parts of the empire. Auvergne was also in the empire for part of the reigns of Henry II and Richard I, in their capacity as dukes of Aquitaine. Henry II and Richard I pushed further claims over the County of Berry but these were not completely fulfilled, and the county was lost completely by the time of the accession of John in 1199.

The frontiers of the empire were sometimes well known and therefore easy to mark, such as the dykes constructed between the royal demesne of the king of France and the Duchy of Normandy. In other places these borders were not so clear, particularly the eastern border of Aquitaine, where there was often a difference between the frontier Henry II, and later Richard I, claimed, and the frontier where their effective power ended.

Scotland was an independent kingdom, but after a disastrous campaign led by William the Lion, English garrisons were established in the castles of Edinburgh, Roxburgh, Jedburgh and Berwick in southern Scotland as defined in the Treaty of Falaise.

===Administration and government===
The Angevin Empire, rather than being administered directly by the ruling monarch, saw power delegated to specially appointed subjects in different areas. Supported by what W. L. Warren called a &quot;self-regulating administrative machine&quot;, these subjects had varied political and military powers.

====England====
England was under the firmest control of all the lands in the Angevin Empire, due to the age of many of the offices that governed the country and the traditions and customs that were in place. England was divided in shires with sheriffs in each enforcing the common law. A justiciar was appointed by the king to stand in his absence when he was on the continent. As the kings of England were more often in France than England they used writs more frequently than the Anglo-Saxon kings, which actually proved beneficial to England. Under William I&#x27;s rule, Anglo-Saxon nobles had been largely replaced by Anglo-Norman settlers whose lands were split between England and France. This made it much harder for them to revolt against the king and defend all of their lands at once. The power of the English earls had grown during the Anarchy between Matilda and Stephen, as she and he vied for support by granting earldoms to various barons, but this reversed beginning with Henry II, whose reign saw the number of earls halve from twenty-four to twelve. England instead saw a reliance on the exchequer to provide both financial and administrative control on behalf of the ruling monarch.

Wales obtained good terms provided it paid homage to the Plantagenets and recognised them as lords. However, it remained almost self-ruling. It supplied the Plantagenets with infantry and longbowmen.

====Ireland====
Ireland was ruled by the Lord of Ireland, who at first had great difficulty imposing his rule. Dublin and Leinster were Angevin strongholds, while Cork, Limerick and parts of eastern Ulster were taken by Anglo-Norman nobles.

====France====
All the continental domains that the Angevin kings ruled were governed by a seneschal at the top of the hierarchical system, with lesser government officials such as baillis, vicomtes, and prévôts. However, all counties and duchies would differ to an extent.

Greater Anjou is a modern term to describe the area consisting of Anjou, Maine, Touraine, Vendôme, and Saintonge. Here, prévôts, the seneschal of Anjou, and other seneschals governed. They were based at Tours, Chinon, Baugé, Beaufort, Brissac, Angers, Saumur, Loudun, Loches, Langeais and Montbazon. However, the constituent counties, such as Maine, were often administered by the officials of the local lords, rather than their Angevin suzerains. Maine was at first largely self-ruling and lacked administration until the Angevin kings made efforts to improve administration by installing new officials, such as the seneschal of Le Mans. These reforms came too late for the Angevins however, and only the Capetians saw the beneficial effects of this reform after they annexed the area.

Aquitaine differed in the level of administration in its different constituent regions. Gascony was a very loosely administered region. Officials were stationed mostly in Entre-Deux-Mers, Bayonne, Dax, but some were found on the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela and also on the river Garonne up to Agen. The rest of Gascony was not administered, despite being such a large area compared to other smaller, well-administered provinces. This difficulty when it came to administering the region wasn&#x27;t new – it had been just as difficult for the previous Poitevin dukes to cement their authority over this area. A similar state of affairs was found in the eastern provinces of Périgord and Limousin, where there was not much of a royal administrative system and practically no officials were stationed. Indeed, there were lords that ruled these regions as if they were &quot;sovereign princes&quot; and they had extra powers, such as the ability to mint their own coins, something English lords had been unable to do for decades. The Lusignans, for example, became rivals to the Angevins during John&#x27;s rule as he attempted to consolidate his power. Officials could be stationed in Poitou, however, due to a large concentration of castles compared to the rest of Aquitaine.

Normandy was the most consistently administered state within the continental Angevin Empire. Under Angevin rule, ducal government was regularised and strengthened, with the Seneschal of Normandy becoming the pre-eminent figure in Norman government. The seneschals&#x27; administrative and judicial power peaked with William FitzRalph. Below them were the baillis, who held both executive, judicial and financial powers. These officials were introduced under Geoffrey of Anjou, replacing the weaker prévôts and vicomtes, in response to the unrest that followed Henry I&#x27;s death and Geoffrey&#x27;s invasion. Ducal authority was the strongest on the frontier near the Capetian royal demesne.

Toulouse was held through weak vassalage by the Count of Toulouse but it was rare for him to comply with Angevin rule. Only Quercy was directly administered by the Angevins after Henry II&#x27;s conquest in 1159, but it did remain a contested area.

Brittany, a region where nobles were traditionally very independent, was under Angevin control during Henry II and Richard I&#x27;s reigns. The county of Nantes was under the firmest control. The Angevins often involved themselves in Breton affairs, such as when Henry II arranged Conan of Brittany&#x27;s marriage and installed the archbishop of Dol.

===Economy===
The economy of the Angevin Empire was quite complicated due to the varying political structure of the different fiefdoms. England and Normandy were well administered and therefore would be able to generate larger revenues than areas such as Aquitaine. This is because England and Normandy were home to more officials to collect taxes and, unlike Aquitaine, local lords were unable to mint their own coins, allowing the Angevin kings to control the economy from their administrative base of Chinon. Chinon&#x27;s importance was shown by Richard&#x27;s seizure of Chinon first when he rebelled against his father in 1187, and then when John immediately rushed to Chinon after his brother&#x27;s death.

Money raised in England was used mostly for continental issues, although John Gillingham argues that although areas like Normandy, Anjou, and Aquitaine are recorded to have brought in less revenue compared to England, much of this is due to poor financial accounts for these continental possessions. Gillingham further argues that by the end of Richard&#x27;s reign, Normandy may have been bringing in even more revenue to the royal treasury than England.

The English revenues themselves varied from year to year. When financial records begin in 1155 to 1156, the annual income of England was £10,500, or around half what the revenue had been under Henry I. This was due in part to The Anarchy and King Stephen&#x27;s loose rule resulting in the reduction of royal authority. As time went on, royal authority improved and the revenue consequently went up to an average of £22,000 a year. Due to the preparation for the Third Crusade, revenue then increased to over £31,000 in 1190 under Richard. The number fell again to £11,000 a year whilst Richard was abroad. Between 1194 and 1198, revenue averaged £25,000. Under Richard&#x27;s successor John, income fluctuated between £22,000 and £25,000 from 1199 to 1203. In order to fund for the reconquest of France, English income increased to £50,000 in 1210 but then rose to over £83,000 in 1211 before falling back down to £50,000 in 1212. Revenue then fell down to below £26,000 in 1214, and then further to £18,500 in 1215. The first three years of Henry III&#x27;s reign brought in £8,000 on average due to the fragility the civil war had brought to England.

In Ireland, the revenue was fairly low at £2,000 for 1212; however, all other records did not survive. For Normandy, there were many fluctuations relative to the politics of the Duchy. The Norman revenues were only £6,750 in 1180, then they reached £25,000 a year in 1198, higher than in England. What was more impressive was that the Norman population was considerably smaller than England&#x27;s, an estimated 1.5 million as opposed to England&#x27;s 3.5 million. This period has become known as the &#x27;Norman Fiscal Revolution&#x27; due to this increase in revenue.

For Aquitaine and Anjou, no records remain. However, it is not because these regions were poor; there were large vineyards, important cities and iron mines. For example, this is what English chronicler Ralph of Diceto wrote about Aquitaine:

The Capetian kings did not record such incomes, although the royal principality was more centralized under Louis VII and Philip II than it had been under Hugh Capet or Robert the Pious. The wealth of the Plantagenet kings was definitely regarded as bigger; Gerald of Wales commented on this wealth with these words:

Petit Dutailli had commented that: &quot;Richard maintained a superiority in resources which would have given him the opportunity, had he lived, to crush his rival.&quot; There is another interpretation, not widely followed and proven wrong, that the king of France could have raised a stronger income, that the royal principality of the king of France generated alone more incomes than all the Angevin Empire combined.

==Formation of the Angevin Empire==
===Background===
The Counts of Anjou had been vying for power in northwestern France since the 10th century. The counts were recurrent enemies of the dukes of Normandy and of Brittany and often the French king. Fulk IV, Count of Anjou, claimed rule over Touraine, Maine and Nantes; however, of these only Touraine proved to be effectively ruled, as the construction of the castles of Chinon, Loches and Loudun exemplify. Fulk IV married his son and namesake, called &quot;Fulk the Younger&quot; (who would later become King of Jerusalem), to Ermengarde, heiress of the province of Maine, thus unifying it with Anjou through personal union.

While the dynasty of the Angevins was successfully consolidating their power in France, their rivals, the Normans, had conquered England in the 11th century. Meanwhile, in the rest of France, the Poitevin Ramnulfids had become Dukes of Aquitaine and of Gascony, and the Count of Blois, Stephen, the father of the next king of England, Stephen, became the Count of Champagne. France was being split between only a few noble families.

=== The Anarchy and the question of the Norman succession ===
In 1106, Henry I of England had defeated his brother Robert Curthose and angered Robert&#x27;s son, William Clito, who was Count of Flanders from 1127. Henry used his paternal inheritance to take the Duchy of Normandy and the Kingdom of England and then tried to establish an alliance with Anjou by marrying his only legitimate son, William, to Fulk the Younger&#x27;s daughter, Matilda. However, William died in the White Ship disaster in 1120.

As a result, Henry then married his own daughter Matilda to Geoffrey &quot;Plantagenet&quot;, Fulk&#x27;s son and successor; however, Henry&#x27;s subjects had to accept Matilda&#x27;s inheritance to the throne of England. There had been only one occurrence of a medieval European queen regnant before, Urraca of León and Castile, and it was not an encouraging precedent; nevertheless, in January 1127 the Anglo-Normans barons and prelates recognized Matilda as heiress to the throne in an oath. On 17 June 1128, the wedding between Matilda and Geoffrey was celebrated in Le Mans.

In order to secure Matilda&#x27;s succession to the royal throne, she and her new husband needed castles and supporters in both England and Normandy, but if they succeeded, there would be two authorities in England: the king and Matilda. Henry prevented the conflict by refusing to hand over any castles to Matilda as well as confiscating the lands of the nobles he suspected of supporting her. By 1135, major disputes between Henry I and Matilda drove the nobles previously loyal to Henry I against Matilda. In November, Henry was dying; Matilda was with her husband in Maine and Anjou while Stephen, brother of the Count of Blois and Champagne, who was Matilda&#x27;s cousin and another contender for the English and Norman thrones, was in Boulogne. Stephen rushed to England upon the news of Henry&#x27;s death and was crowned King of England in December 1135.

Geoffrey first sent his wife Matilda alone to Normandy in a diplomatic mission to be recognized Duchess of Normandy and replace Stephen. Geoffrey followed at the head of his army and quickly captured several fortresses in southern Normandy. It was then that a noble in Anjou, Robert II of Sablé, rebelled, forcing Geoffrey to withdraw and prevent an attack on his rear. When Geoffrey returned to Normandy in September 1136, the region had become plagued with internal, baronial infighting. Stephen was not able to travel to Normandy and so the situation remained. Geoffrey had found new allies with the Count of Vendôme and, most importantly, William X, Duke of Aquitaine. At the head of a new army and ready for conquest, Geoffrey was wounded and was forced to return to Anjou again. Furthermore, an outbreak of dysentery plagued his army. Orderic Vitalis stated &quot;the invaders had to run for home leaving a trail of filth behind them&quot;. Stephen finally arrived in Normandy in 1137 and restored order but had lost much credibility in the eyes of his main supporter, Robert of Gloucester and so Robert changed sides and supported Geoffrey and his half-sister Matilda instead. Geoffrey took Caen and Argentan without resistance, but now had to defend Robert&#x27;s possessions in England against Stephen. In 1139, Robert and Matilda crossed the channel and arrived in England while Geoffrey kept the pressure on Normandy. Stephen was captured in February 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln, which prompted the collapse of his authority in both England and Normandy.

Geoffrey now controlled almost all of Normandy, but no longer had the support of Aquitaine now that William X had been succeeded by his daughter, Eleanor, who had married Louis VII of France in 1137. Louis was not concerned with the events in Normandy and England. While Geoffrey consolidated his Norman power, Matilda suffered defeats in England. At Winchester, Robert of Gloucester was captured while covering Matilda&#x27;s retreat so Matilda freed Stephen in exchange for Robert.

In 1142, Geoffrey was asked by Matilda for assistance but refused; he had become more interested in Normandy. Following the capture of Avranches, Mortain and Cherbourg, Rouen surrendered to him in 1144 and he anointed himself duke of Normandy. In exchange for Gisors, he was formally recognised by Louis VII. However, Geoffrey still didn&#x27;t assist Matilda even as she was on the verge of defeat. Further rebellion occurred in Anjou, including Geoffrey&#x27;s younger brother, Helie, demanding Maine. It was during this period of Angevin unrest that Geoffrey dropped the title of duke of Normandy and formally invested his son Henry as duke in 1150, though both Geoffrey and Matilda would continue to dominate Norman affairs. The following six decades of Angevin rule over Normandy would see the establishment of Norman customs and institutions that would last until the French Revolution.

===The nominal foundation of the Angevin Empire===
Stephen continued to claim Normandy, believing an alliance with Louis was possible. Louis VII had recognised Henry as duke of Normandy in August 1151 in exchange for concessions in the Norman Vexin, but remained angered by Henry and Geoffrey&#x27;s treatment of Giraud II of Montreuil-Berlay following Giraud&#x27;s failed rebellion against Angevin rule the year before.

This situation quickly began to shift when, in September, Geoffrey died and Henry inherited his position as Count of Anjou, with rule also over Touraine and Maine. Geoffrey had planned to leave Anjou to his younger son, Geoffrey, but this would have hampered Henry&#x27;s ability to succeed in conquering England. Geoffrey instead asked his vassals to swear that his body would be left unburied until Henry promised to abide by his wishes. W. L. Warren suggested that this story was spread purely to justify the younger Geoffrey&#x27;s later rebellion against Henry, and that the Angevin nobles supported the story as it gave them an opportunity to reclaim their lost autonomy.

In March 1152, Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine had their marriage annulled under the pretext of consanguinity at the council of Beaugency. The terms of the annulment left Eleanor as duchess of Aquitaine but still a vassal of Louis. She left Beaugency for Poitiers, narrowly escaping an ambush by Henry&#x27;s brother Geoffrey on route, and there, eight weeks later, she married Henry. Thus Henry became duke of Aquitaine and Gascony and count of Poitou. Louis responded with a furious attack on Normandy.

In Anjou, Henry had refused to give the county to his brother, and thus a coalition of Henry&#x27;s enemies was formed by Louis VII: Stephen of England and his son Eustace IV of Boulogne (married to Louis&#x27; sister); Henry I, Count of Champagne (betrothed to Louis&#x27; daughter), Robert of Dreux (Louis&#x27; brother) and Henry&#x27;s brother, Geoffrey.

In July 1152, Capetian troops attacked Aquitaine while Louis, Eustace, Henry of Champagne, and Robert attacked Normandy. Geoffrey raised a revolt in Anjou while Stephen attacked Angevin loyalists in England. Several Anglo-Norman nobles switched allegiance, sensing an impending disaster. Henry was about to sail for England to pursue his claim when his lands were attacked. He first reached Anjou and compelled Geoffrey to surrender. He then took the decision to sail for England in January 1153 to meet Stephen. Luckily enough, Louis fell ill and had to retire from the conflict while Henry&#x27;s defences held against his enemies. After seven months of battles and politics, Henry failed to get rid of Stephen but then Stephen&#x27;s son, Eustace, died in dubious circumstances, &quot;struck by the wrath of god.&quot; Stephen gave up the struggle by ratifying the Treaty of Winchester, making Henry his heir on condition that the landed possessions of his family were guaranteed in England and France—the same terms Matilda had previously refused after her victory at Lincoln. Henry became King Henry II of England upon Stephen&#x27;s death on 25 October 1154. Subsequently, the question was again raised of Henry&#x27;s oath to cede Anjou to his brother Geoffrey. Henry received a dispensation from Pope Adrian IV under the pretext the oath had been forced upon him, and he proposed compensations to Geoffrey at Rouen in 1156. Geoffrey refused and returned to Anjou to rebel against his brother. Geoffrey may have had a strong claim, but his position was weak. Louis would not interfere since Henry paid homage to him for his continental possessions. Henry crushed Geoffrey&#x27;s revolt, and Geoffrey had to be satisfied with an annual pension. The Angevin Empire had now been formed.

==Expansions of the Angevin Empire==
In the earlier years of his reign, Henry II claimed further lands and worked on the creation of a ring of vassal states as buffers, especially around England and Normandy. The most obvious areas to expand, where large claims were held, were Scotland, Wales, Brittany, and, as an ally rather than a new dominion, Flanders.

King David I of Scotland had taken advantage of The Anarchy to seize Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland. In Wales, important leaders like Rhys of Deheubarth and Owain Gwynedd had emerged. In Brittany, there is no evidence that the Duke of Brittany, Eudes II, had recognised the Norman overlordship. Two vital frontier castles, Moulins-la-Marche and Bonmoulins, had never been taken back by Geoffrey Plantagenet and were in the hands of Robert of Dreux. Count Thierry of Flanders had joined the alliance formed by Louis VII in 1153. Further south, the Count of Blois acquired Amboise. From Henry II&#x27;s perspective, these territorial issues needed solving.

King Henry II showed himself to be an audacious and daring king as well as being active and mobile; Roger of Howden stated that Henry travelled across his dominions so fast that Louis VII once exclaimed that &quot;The king of England is now in Ireland, now in England, now in Normandy, he seems rather to fly than to go by horse or ship.&quot; Henry was often more present in France than in England; Ralph de Diceto, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, said with irony:

===Castles and strongholds in France===
Henry II bought Vernon and Neuf-Marché back from Louis VII in 1154. This new strategy now regulated the Plantagenet-Capetian relationship. Louis VII had been unsuccessful in his attempt to break Henry II down. Because of the Angevin control of England in 1154, it was pointless to object to the superiority of the overall Angevin forces over the Capetian ones. However, Henry II refused to back down despite Louis&#x27; apparent change of policy until the Norman Vexin was entirely recovered. Thomas Becket, then the current Chancellor of England, was sent as ambassador to Paris in the summer of 1158 to lead negotiations. He displayed all the wealth the Angevins could provide and, according to William Fitzstephen, a clerk and companion of Becket, a Frenchman exclaimed &quot;If the Chancellor of England travels in such splendor, what must the king be?&quot; Louis VII&#x27;s daughter, Margaret, who was still a baby, was betrothed to Henry&#x27;s heir, his eldest son, Henry the Young King with a dowry of the Norman Vexin. Henry II was given back the castles of Moulins-la-Marche and Bonmoulins. Theobald V, Count of Blois handed Amboise and Fréteval back to him.

===Flanders===
The counts of Flanders had long been powerful but capricious allies of the kings of France. Count Thierry had taken part in Louis VII&#x27;s early assaults against Henry II, and Henry had expelled all Flemish mercenaries in England at the time of his accession, but much of Flanders&#x27; prosperity relied on English trade and England traded much of its wool via the Flemish port of Boulogne. Henry, therefore, was able to re-establish friendly relations to the extent that Thierry appointed Henry guardian of his eldest son and regent, Philip, when Thierry undertook his pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1157.

When William of Blois died without an heir in 1159, the titles of Count of Boulogne and Count of Mortain fell vacant. Henry II absorbed Mortain into his Duchy of Normandy, but granted Boulogne and William&#x27;s sister, Mary, to Thierry&#x27;s second son, Matthew. Through this marriage, and the 1163 renewal of a previous treaty between Henry I of England, and Robert II of Flanders, Henry II was assured of Flemish neutrality if war broke out with the king of France again. Flanders would provide Henry II with knights in exchange of an annual tribute in money, known as a &quot;money-fief&quot;.

===Brittany===
In 1148, Conan III, Duke of Brittany, died, leaving behind two children. Although his son Hoël was the natural choice to succeed to the ducal throne, evidence suggests that Hoël was illegitimate and instead he was only recognised as Count of Nantes. Hoël&#x27;s sister Bertha became Duchess of Brittany, ruling alongside her husband, Eudo of Porhoët. However Bertha had a son, Conan, from her previous marriage to the late Alan de Bretagne. Conan had been too young to succeed his grandfather in 1148, but he became Henry II&#x27;s perfect candidate to become Duke of Brittany on Bertha&#x27;s death, as his English holdings as Earl of Richmond meant he would be easier to control.

In Nantes, possibly due to Hoël&#x27;s recognition of his sister and brother-in-law&#x27;s suzerainty over the county, the citizens rose up against Hoël in 1156 and installed Henry II&#x27;s brother Geoffrey in Hoël&#x27;s place as count, at Henry II&#x27;s suggestion. In September, this was followed up with a successful invasion of the duchy by Conan against his stepfather, Eudo, ending in Conan&#x27;s accession as Duke of Brittany, albeit with Nantes remaining under direct Angevin control. However by 1158, Geoffrey had died and Conan seized Nantes. Nantes was especially important to Henry II as it sat at the mouth of the Loire, and threatened trade from Angers and Tours. Henry II responded to this seizure by mustering an army in Avranches, as well as threatening Conan&#x27;s English estates. Conan submitted, ceding Nantes back to Henry II and in return was recognised as Duke. During Conan&#x27;s rule, Henry II continued to intervene—he arranged Conan&#x27;s marriage to Margaret of Scotland and appointed the Archbishop of Dol, despite attempts by the Archbishop of Tours, Engelbald, to subsume Dol into his archdiocese.

By 1166, it became apparent that Conan was unable to independently maintain order in Brittany and, in response, Henry II seized control. He betrothed Conan&#x27;s daughter and heir, Constance, to his son, Geoffrey, and took possession of the duchy in Geoffrey&#x27;s name. At Thouars, Henry II received homage from most of the Breton nobles, and then went on to Rennes where the Breton dukes had historically been invested in the city&#x27;s cathedral. Over the following years, some nobles continued to rebel against Angevin rule, but Henry responded to each rebellion with confiscations of territory and castles. By 1169, the duchy was firmly under Angevin control, with Henry II&#x27;s son, Geoffrey, receiving homage himself from the Breton nobles in May at Rennes.

===Scotland===
Henry II met Malcolm IV in 1157 to discuss Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumberland, which had previously been seized by Malcolm&#x27;s grandfather, David I of Scotland. In 1149, before Henry II became powerful, he made an oath to David that the lands north of Newcastle should belong to the King of Scotland forever. Malcolm reminded him of this oath but Henry II did not comply. There is no evidence that Henry II got a dispensation from the pope this time, as William of Newburgh put it, &quot;prudently considering it was the king of England who had the better of the argument by reason of his much greater power.&quot;

Malcolm IV gave up and paid homage in return for Huntingdon, which he inherited from his father.

William the Lion, the next King of Scotland, was unhappy with Henry II since he was given Northumberland by David I in 1152 and therefore lost it to Henry II when Malcolm IV handed it back in 1157.

As a part of the coalition set by Louis VII, William the Lion first invaded Northumberland in 1173 and then again in 1174, as a result he was captured near Alnwick and had to sign the tough Treaty of Falaise. Garrisons were to be set in the castles of Edinburgh, Roxburgh, Jedburgh and Berwick. Southern Scotland was from then under firm control just as Brittany was. On 5 December 1189, Richard I of England would annul the Treaty with the Quit-claim of Canterbury, which saw the return of Roxburgh and Berwick and a formal acknowledgment of Scotland&#x27;s independence in return for money to fund Richard&#x27;s crusade in what Warren called a &quot;diplomatic triumph,&quot; protecting England&#x27;s northern flank during John&#x27;s later rebellion of 1193–4.

===Wales===
Rhys of Deheubarth, also called Lord Rhys, and Owain Gwynedd were closed to negotiations. Henry II had to attack Wales three times, in 1157, 1158 and 1163 to have them answer his summons to the court. The Welsh found his terms too harsh and largely revolted against him. Henry then undertook a fourth invasion in 1164, this time with a massive army. According to the Welsh chronicle &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;, Henry raised &quot;a mighty host of the picked warriors of England and Normandy and Flanders and Anjou and Gascony and Scotland&quot; in order to &quot;carry into bondage and to destroy all the Britons&quot;.

Bad weather, rains, floods, and constant harassment from the Welsh armies slowed the Angevin army and prevented the capture of Wales (see the Battle of Crogen); a furious Henry II had Welsh hostages mutilated. Wales would remain safe for a while, but the invasion of Ireland in 1171 pressured Henry II to end the issue through negotiations with Lord Rhys.

===Ireland===

There were further plans of expansion considered as Henry II&#x27;s last brother didn&#x27;t have a fiefdom. The Holy See was most likely to support a campaign in Ireland which would bring its church into the Christian Latin world of Rome. Henry II was given Rome&#x27;s blessing in 1155 under the form of a Papal bull, but had to postpone the invasion of Ireland because of all the problems in his domains and around them. In the terms of the Bull &quot;Laudabiliter&quot;, &quot;Laudably and profitably does your magnificence contemplate extending your glorious name on earth.&quot;

William X, Count of Poitou died in 1164 without being installed in Ireland, but Henry II didn&#x27;t give up on the conquest of Ireland. In 1167, an Irish King, Dermot of Leinster, was recognised as &quot;prince of Leinster&quot; by Henry II and was allowed to recruit soldiers in England and Wales to use in Ireland against the other Kings. The knights first met great success in carving themselves lands in Ireland, so much it worried Henry II enough to land himself in Ireland in October 1171 near Waterford and confronted to such demonstration of power most native kings of Ireland recognised him as their lord. Even Rory O&#x27; Connor, the king of Connacht and High King of Ireland paid homage to Henry II. Henry II installed some of his men in strongholds like Dublin and Leinster (as Dermot was dead). He also gave unconquered kingdoms such as Cork, Limerick and Ulster to his men and left the Normans carving their lands in Ireland.

In 1177, Henry II made his son, John, the first Lord of Ireland, but John&#x27;s youth meant it wasn&#x27;t until 1185 that he departed with 300 knights to cement his rule. John would almost immediately fail, uniting Irish chieftains and Anglo-Norman settlers alike against him. He returned within the year to his father—he would not return for 25 years, while other Anglo-Normans such as John de Courcy and Hugh de Lacy built castles and installed their interests.

===Toulouse===
Much less tenable was the claim over Toulouse, the fortified seat of the County of Toulouse. Eleanor&#x27;s ancestors claimed the large county, as it had been the central power of the ancient Duchy of Aquitaine in the times of Odo the Great. However Henry II and possibly Eleanor were likely not related to this ancient line of dukes; Eleanor was a Ramnulfid, while Henry II was an Angevin.

Toulouse was larger, more heavily fortified, and much richer than many cities of the time. It was strategically important, sitting between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean, dominating regional trade and road networks that included significant towns such as Narbonne, Cahors, Albi, Nîmes and Carcassonne. The recurrent conflicts by the Angevins with Toulouse would be called the &quot;Forty Years War&quot; by William of Newburgh.

In June 1159, Henry II&#x27;s forces gathered in Poitiers. They included troops from all of his fiefdoms from Gascony to England, and reinforcements sent by Thierry and King Malcolm IV of Scotland. Even a Welsh prince joined the fray. The only larger armies of the times were those raised for major crusades. Henry II attacked from the north; his allies the Trencavels and Ramon Berenguer opened a second front. Henry II couldn&#x27;t capture Toulouse proper since his overlord, King Louis VII of France, was part of the defence and he didn&#x27;t want to set an example to his vassals or have to deal with keeping his sovereign prisoner. Henry II did capture Cahors along with castles in the Garonne valley in the Quercy region.

Henry II returned in 1161, but too busy with conflicts elsewhere in his fiefdom, he left his allies fighting against Toulouse. Alfonso II the King of Aragon, himself having interests there, joined the war. In 1171 Henry II&#x27;s alliance was bolstered by another of Raymond V&#x27;s enemies, Humbert of Maurienne.

In 1173, in Limoges, Raymond finally gave up after over a decade of constant fights. He paid homage to Henry II, to Henry&#x27;s sons Henry and Richard, the Duke of Aquitaine.

==Pinnacle of the Angevin Empire==
The attacks on Toulouse made clear that peace between Louis VII and Henry II was not peace at all but just an opportunity for Henry to make war elsewhere. Louis was in an awkward position: his subject, Henry, was largely more powerful than he was and Louis had no male heir. Constance, his second wife, died in childbirth in 1160 and Louis VII announced he would remarry at once, in the urgent need of a male heir, with Adèle of Champagne. Henry II&#x27;s son, Henry, two years old, was finally married to Margaret under the pressure of Henry II, and, as declared in 1158, the Norman Vexin went to him as Margaret&#x27;s dowry. If Louis VII died without a male heir, Henry would have been a strong candidate for the French throne.

In 1164, Louis found a dangerous ally in Archbishop Thomas Becket. Louis and Becket had met previously in 1158, but now the circumstances were different; France was already refuge to a few clerical refugees, and Louis was known as &quot;Rex Christianisimus&quot; (most Christian king), called so by John of Salisbury. Becket took refuge in France, and following this there were growing conflicts between Henry II and Becket. Henry finally provoked Becket&#x27;s murder in 1170 by announcing, &quot;What miserable traitors have I nourished in my household who led their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk!&quot; Christendom blamed Henry, whereas Louis gained widespread approval due to his protection of Becket. Louis&#x27; secular power was much weaker than Henry&#x27;s but Louis now had the moral advantage.

In 1165, hopes of Henry II&#x27;s son&#x27;s future accession to the French throne were dashed when Adèle gave birth to a son, Philip. Following this, the fragile Anglo-French peace ended. In 1167, Henry II marched into Auvergne, and in 1170 he also attacked Bourges. Louis VII answered by raiding the Norman Vexin, forcing Henry II to move his troops north, giving Louis the opportunity to free Bourges. At this point, John Gillingham mentions in &quot;The Angevin Empire&quot; that he believes Louis &quot;must have wondered whether there was ever going to be an end to Henry&#x27;s aggressively expansionist policies&quot;.

Henry II did not treat his territories as a coherent empire as the term &quot;Angevin Empire&quot; would suggest, but as private, individual possessions that he planned to distribute to his children. Henry, &#x27;The Young King&#x27;, was crowned King of England in 1170 (though he never ruled); Richard became Duke of Aquitaine in 1172; Geoffrey became Duke of Brittany in 1181; John became Lord of Ireland in 1185; Eleanor was promised to Alfonso VII with Gascony as dowry during the campaign against Toulouse in 1170. This partition of the lands between his children made it much harder for him to control them, as now they could fund their own ventures with their estates and attempt to overrule their father in their respective dominions.

Following his coronation, in 1173, Henry, &#x27;the Young King&#x27;, asked for part of his inheritance, at least England, Normandy, or Anjou, but his father refused. Young Henry then joined Louis at the French court to otherthrow his father together, and his mother, Eleanor, joined the new revolt against Henry II. Both Richard and Geoffrey soon joined their brother. Enemies that Henry II had made previously now joined the conflict with Louis, including King William of Scotland, Count Philip of Flanders, Count Matthew of Boulogne and Count Theobald of Blois. Henry II emerged victorious; his wealth meant he could recruit large numbers of mercenaries. He had captured and imprisoned his wife, Eleanor, early on, and the capture of King William allowed him to force Scotland into the Treaty of Falaise. Henry bought the County of Marche, then he asserted that the French Vexin and Bourges should be given back at once. However, this time there was no invasion to back the claim.

===Richard I and Philip II===
Louis VII died in 1180 and was succeeded by his 15-year-old son, crowned as Philip II. The man who would later become Philip&#x27;s main rival, the future Richard I, had administered Aquitaine since 1175 but his policy of centralisation of the Aquitanian government had grown unpopular in the eastern part of the Duchy, notably Périgord and Limousin. Richard was further disliked in Aquitaine due to his apparent disregard for Aquitaine&#x27;s customs of inheritance, as shown by events in Angoulême in 1181. If Richard was unpopular in Aquitaine though, Philip was equally disliked by his contemporaries with comments describing him as: &quot;astute, manipulative, calculating, penurious and ungallant ruler.&quot;

In 1183, Henry the Young King joined a revolt to overthrow the unpopular Duke Richard, led by the viscount of Limoges and Geoffrey of Lusignan, where Henry would take Richard&#x27;s place. Joined by Philip II, Count Raymond V of Toulouse, and Duke Hugh III of Burgundy, Henry died suddenly of a fatal illness in 1183, saving Richard&#x27;s position.

Richard, now Henry II&#x27;s oldest son, became Henry&#x27;s heir. Henry ordered him to hand Aquitaine to his brother, John, but Richard refused. Henry was busy with Welsh princes contesting his authority, William the Lion was asking for his castles to be given back that had been taken in the Treaty of Falaise, and now Henry the Young King was dead, Philip wanted the Norman Vexin handed back. Henry II decided instead to insist Richard to nominally surrender Aquitaine to his mother whilst Richard would retain actual control. Still, in 1183, Count Raymond had taken Cahors back and so Henry II asked Richard to mount an expedition to retake the city. At the time, Geoffrey of Brittany had been quarrelling violently with Richard and Philip planned to use this, but Geoffrey&#x27;s death in 1186 in a tournament killed the plot. The next year, Philip and Richard had become strong allies:


In 1188, Raymond attacked again, joined by the Lusignans, vassals of Richard. It was rumoured that Henry himself had financed the revolts. Philip attacked Henry in Normandy and captured strongholds in Berry, then they met to discuss peace again. Henry refused to make Richard his heir, with one story reporting that Richard said &quot;Now at last, I must believe what I had always thought impossible.&quot;

Henry&#x27;s plans collapsed. Richard paid homage to Philip for the continental lands his father held then they attacked Henry together. The Aquitanians refused to help whilst the Bretons seized the opportunity to attack him too. Henry&#x27;s birthplace, Le Mans, was captured and Tours fell. Henry was encircled at Chinon and was compelled to surrender. He gave a large tribute in money to Philip and swore that all his subjects in France and England would recognise Richard as their lord. Henry died two days later, after learning John, the only son that had previously never betrayed him, had joined Richard and Philip. He was buried in Fontevraud Abbey.

Eleanor, who had been Henry&#x27;s hostage since the 1173–4 revolt, was freed while Rhys ap Gruffydd, ruler of Deheubarth in South Wales, began to reconquer the parts of Wales that Henry had annexed. Richard was crowned King Richard I of England in Westminster Abbey in November 1189, and had already been installed as Duke of Normandy, Count of Anjou and Duke of Aquitaine. Richard demanded Philip surrender the Vexin but then the issue was settled when Richard announced he would marry Alys, Philip&#x27;s sister. Richard also recognised Auvergne as being in Philip&#x27;s royal demesne and not as part of the Duchy of Aquitaine, as Henry had claimed. The two lion kings, William the Lion, King of Scotland, and Richard, opened negotiations to revoke the Treaty of Falaise and an agreement was reached.

===The Third Crusade===
The next priority for King Richard I was the Third Crusade; it had been delayed since Richard had taken the cross in 1187. This was not just a religious pilgrimage however; his great-grandfather, Fulk had been King of Jerusalem and the current pretender to the throne, Guy de Lusignan was a Poitevin noble, related to many of Richard&#x27;s vassals, while Guy&#x27;s wife—Sybilla—was Richard&#x27;s cousin. The crusade, excluding disputes in France, would be the main reason for Richard&#x27;s absence from England; he would spend less than six months of his reign in England.

Before leaving, Richard consolidated his reign over the Empire. He suspected Count Raymond would expand his lands into Aquitaine so he allied with Sancho VI the Wise, the King of Navarre, by marrying his daughter, Berengaria, to counter the threat.
In the way to the Holy Land, the ruler of Cyprus offended Richard&#x27;s bride and Richard&#x27;s army conquered the island.
They married in 1191 in Limassol, Cyprus, therefore repudiating Alys, Philip&#x27;s sister, but the issue had been settled earlier in Messina. To placate Philip, Richard had given him 10,000 marks and agreed that if he had two sons, they would both hold lands in France directly under Philip. The administration Richard left behind worked considerably well, as an attack from Raymond was repelled with the help of Navarre.

The siege of Acre, which had been the last Christian stronghold in Holy Land, was over by July and Philip decided to return to France. It is unclear whether Philip returned due to dysentery, anger towards Richard, or that he thought he could gain Artois following the death of the Count of Flanders, as he had married the Count&#x27;s daughter. Whilst back at France, Philip boasted he was &#x27;going to devastate the king of England&#x27;s lands&#x27; and, in January 1192, he demanded from the seneschal of Normandy, William FitzRalph, the Vexin, claiming that the treaty he had signed with Richard in Messina contained the intention of Richard that, as the Vexin had been Alys&#x27; dowry and since Richard had married Berengaria, he was entitled to the land. Although Philip threatened invasion, Eleanor of Aquitaine intervened in stopping her son, John, from promising to concede the land. Philip&#x27;s nobles refused to attack the lands of an absent crusader, though Philip instead gained lands in Artois. Philip&#x27;s return did result in castles throughout the empire being in a &quot;state of readiness&quot;. The alliance with Navarre helped again when Philip attempted to incite revolt in Aquitaine but failed.

King Richard yielded Cyprus and left the Holy Land over a year later than Philip in October 1192, and possibly could have retrieved his empire intact had he reached France soon after. However, during the crusade Leopold V, Duke of Austria, had been insulted by Richard, and so he arrested Richard near Vienna, on his journey home. Richard had been forced to go through Austria as the path through Provence was blocked by Raymond in Toulouse. Leopold also accused Richard of sending assassins to murder his cousin Conrad, and then handed Richard over to his overlord, Emperor Henry VI.

In January 1193, Richard&#x27;s brother, John, was summoned to Paris, where he did homage to Philip for all of Richard&#x27;s lands, and promised to marry Alys with Artois as her dowry. In return, the Vexin and the castle of Gisors would be given to Philip. With the help of Philip, John went to invade England and incite rebellion against Richard&#x27;s justiciars. John failed and then had worse luck when it was discovered Richard was alive, which was unknown until this point. At the imperial court in Speyer, Richard was put on trial where he spoke very well for himself:

Richard was to be set free after a deal was finalised in June 1193. However, whilst the discussions had been going on, Philip and John had created war in three different areas of the Angevin Empire. Firstly, in England, John had attempted to take over, asserting that Richard would never return. The justiciars pushed him and his forces back to the castles of Tickhill and Windsor, which were besieged. A deal was made that allowed John to keep Tickhill and Nottingham, but return his other possessions. Secondly, in Aquitaine, Ademar of Angoulême claimed that he held his county directly as a fief of Philip&#x27;s, not as a vassal of the Duke of Aquitaine. He raided Poitou but was stopped by the local officials, and captured. Thirdly, and finally, in Normandy, Philip had taken Gisors and Neaufles, and the lords of Aumâle, Eu, and other smaller lordships, as well as the counts of Meulan and Perche, had surrendered to Philip. Philip failed to take Rouen in April but gained other castles; Gillingham summarised, saying that &quot;April and May 1193 were wonderfully good months for Philip&quot;.

When Philip heard of Richard&#x27;s deal with Emperor Henry, he decided to consolidate his gains by forcing Richard&#x27;s regents to concede with a treaty at Mantes in July 1193. Firstly, John was handed back his estates in both England and France. Secondly, Count Ademar was to be released and no Aquitanian vassals were to be charged or penalised. Thirdly, Richard was to give four major castles to Philip and pay the cost of garrisoning them, along with other compensation.

Richard failed to be reconciled with his brother, John, and so John went to Philip and created a new treaty in January 1194, surrendering all of Normandy east of the Seine except Rouen and Tours and the other castles of Touraine to Philip, Vendôme to Louis of Blois, and Moulins and Bonsmoulins to Count Geoffrey of Perche. The county of Angoulême was to be independent of the duchy of Aquitaine. The Angevin Empire was being completely split by John&#x27;s actions. Philip continued to bargain with Emperor Henry, and the emperor cut a new deal with Richard after being offered large sums of money by Philip and John. Richard would surrender the kingdom of England to Henry, who would then give it back as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. Richard had become a vassal of Henry. Richard was released, and whilst still in Germany he paid for the homage of the archbishops of Mainz and Cologne, the bishop of Liège, the duke of Brabant, the duke of Limburg, the count of Holland, and other lesser lords. These allies were the beginning of a coalition against Philip.

Although Philip had been granted many Norman territories, it was only nominally. In February, he captured Évreux, Neubourg, Vaudreuil, and other towns. He also received the homage of two of Richard&#x27;s vassals, Geoffrey de Rancon and Bernard of Brosse. Philip and his allies were now in control of all the ports of Flanders, Boulogne, and eastern Normandy. Richard finally returned to England and landed at Sandwich on 13 March 1194.

===Richard after captivity===
Richard was in a difficult position; Philip II had taken over large parts of his continental domains and had inherited Amiens and Artois. England was Richard&#x27;s most secure possession; Hubert Walter, who had been to the crusade with Richard, was appointed his justiciar. Richard besieged the remaining castle that had declared allegiance to John and not capitulated: Nottingham Castle. He then met with William the Lion in April and rejected William the Lion&#x27;s offer to purchase Northumbria, to which William possessed a claim. Later, he took over John&#x27;s Lordship of Ireland and replaced his justiciar.

Richard I had merely crossed the English Channel to claim back his territories that John Lackland betrayed Philip II by murdering the garrison of Évreux and handing the town down to Richard I. &quot;He had first betrayed his father, then his brother and now our King&quot; said William the Breton. Sancho the Strong, the future King of Navarre, joined the conflict and attacked Aquitaine, capturing Angoulème and Tours. Richard himself was known to be a great military commander. The first part of this war was difficult for Richard who suffered several setbacks, as Philip II was, as described by John Gillingham, &quot;a shrewd politician and a competent soldier.&quot; But by October the new Count of Toulouse, Raymond VI, left the Capetian side and joined Richard&#x27;s. He was followed by Baldwin IV of Flanders, the future Latin Emperor, as this one was contesting Artois to Philip II. In 1197, Henry VI died and was replaced by Otto IV, Richard I&#x27;s own nephew. Renaud de Dammartin, the Count of Boulogne and a skilled commander, also deserted Philip II. Baldwin IV was invading Artois and captured Saint-Omer while Richard I was campaigning in Berry and inflicted a severe defeat on Philip II at Gisors, close to Paris. A truce was accepted, and Richard I had almost recovered all Normandy and now held more territories in Aquitaine than he had before. Richard I had to deal with a revolt once again, but this time from Limousin. He was struck by a bolt in April 1199 at Châlus-Chabrol and died of a subsequent infection. His body was buried at Fontevraud like his father.

==Collapse of the Angevin Empire==

===John&#x27;s accession to the throne===
Following the news of King Richard I&#x27;s death in 1199, John attempted to seize the Angevin treasury at Chinon in order to impose his control of the Angevin government. Angevin custom, however, gave John&#x27;s nephew, Duke Arthur, son of Geoffrey of Brittany, a stronger claim on Richard&#x27;s throne, and the nobles of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine declared in favour of Arthur on 18 April 1199. Philip II of France had taken Évreux and the Norman Vexin, and a Breton army had seized Angers by this point. Le Mans refused to declare allegiance to John, so he ran to Normandy, where he was invested as duke in Rouen on 25 April. He returned to Le Mans with an army where he punished its citizens and then left for England. England had declared its support for John thanks to William Marshal and Archbishop Hubert Walter of Canterbury&#x27;s support. He was crowned on 27 May in Westminster Abbey.

Due to his mother&#x27;s support, Aquitaine and Poitou supported John, and only Anjou, Maine, Touraine, and Brittany remained disputed. In May, Aimeri, Viscount of Thouars, who was chosen by John to be his seneschal in Anjou, attacked Tours in an attempt to capture Arthur. Aimeri failed, and John was forced to return to the continent in order to secure his rule, through a truce with Philip II, after Philip had launched attacks on Normandy. Philip was forced into the truce due to John&#x27;s support from fifteen French counts and support from counts in the Lower Rhine, such as with Count Baldwin of Flanders, who he met in August 1199 in Rouen, and Baldwin did John homage. From a position of strength, John was able to go on the offensive, and he won William des Roches, Arthur&#x27;s candidate for the Angevin seneschal, to his cause following an incident with Philip. William des Roches also brought Arthur and his mother, Constance, as prisoners to Le Mans on 22 September 1199, and the succession appeared to have been secured in favour of John.

Despite the escape of Arthur and Constance with Aimeri of Thouars to Philip II, and many of Richard&#x27;s previous allies in France, including the counts of Flanders, Blois, and Perche, leaving for the Holy Land, John was able to make peace with Philip that secured his accession to his brother&#x27;s throne. John met with Philip and signed the Treaty of Le Goulet in May 1200, where Philip accepted John&#x27;s succession to the Angevin Empire, and Arthur became his vassal, but John was forced to break his German alliances, accept Philip&#x27;s gains in Normandy, and cede lands in Auvergne and Berry. John was also to accept Philip as his suzerain overlord and pay Philip 20,000 marks. As W. L. Warren notes, this Treaty began the practical dominance of the French king over France, and the ruler of the Angevin Empire was no longer the dominating noble in France. In June 1200, John visited Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, taking hostages from those he distrusted, and visiting Aquitaine, where he received homage from his mother&#x27;s vassals, returning to Poitiers in August.

===Lusignan rebellion and the Anglo-French war===

Following the annulment of John&#x27;s first marriage to Isabelle of Gloucester, John married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Count Aymer of Angoulême, on 24 August 1200. Angoulême had considerable strategic significance, and the marriage made &quot;very good political sense&quot;, according to Warren. However, Isabella had been betrothed to Hugh of Lusignan, and John&#x27;s treatment of Hugh following the marriage, including the seizure of La Marche, led Hugh to appeal to Philip II. Philip summoned John to his court, and John&#x27;s refusal resulted in the confiscation of John&#x27;s continental possessions excluding Normandy in April 1202 and Philip accepting Arthur&#x27;s homage for the lands in July. Philip went on to invade Normandy as far as Arques in May, taking a number of castles.

John, following a message from his mother, Eleanor, rushed from Le Mans to Mirebeau, attacking the town on 1 August 1202, with William des Roches. William promised to direct the attack on condition he was consulted on the fate of Arthur, and successfully captured the town along with over 200 knights, including three Lusignans. John captured Arthur and his sister Eleanor. John failed to consult William on Arthur&#x27;s fate causing him to desert John with Aimeri of Thouars and besiege Angers. Under the control of Hubert de Burgh in Falaise, Arthur disappeared and John was seen as responsible for his murder. Eleanor remained in custody until her death in 1241. The Angevin Empire was under attack in all areas, with the following year, 1203, being described as that &quot;of shame&quot; by Warren. In December 1203, John left Normandy never to return, and on 24 June 1204, Normandy capitulated with the surrender of Arques, Rouen, and Verneuil. Tours, Chinon, and Loches had fallen by 1205.

On the night of 31 March 1204, John&#x27;s mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, died, causing a rush of &quot;most of Poitou...to do homage to the king of France&quot;. King Alfonso of Castile invaded Gascony, using the claim of his wife, John&#x27;s sister Eleanor. When John went to the continent in June 1206, only the resistance led by Hélie de Malemort, Archbishop of Bordeaux had prevented Alfonso&#x27;s success. By the end of John&#x27;s expedition on 26 October 1206, most of Aquitaine was secure. A truce was made between John and Philip to last for two years. The Angevin Empire had been reduced to England, Gascony, Ireland, and parts of Poitou, and John would not return to his continental possessions for eight years.

===Return to France===
By the end of 1212, Philip II was preparing an invasion of England. Philip aimed to crown his son, Louis, king of England, and at a council at Soissons in April 1213, he drafted a possible relationship between the future France and England. On 30 May, William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury, succeeding in crushing the French invasion fleet in the Battle of Damme and preventing French invasion. In February 1214, John landed in La Rochelle after creating alliances headed by the Holy Roman Emperor, Otto. The aim was for the Earl of Salisbury and John&#x27;s German allies to attack Philip from the north, whilst John attacked from the south.

By June 1214, John had the support of the houses of Lusignan, Mauléon, and Thouars, but when John advanced into Anjou, capturing Angers on 17 June, the desertion of his Poitevin allies forced a retreat back to La Rochelle. On 27 July, John&#x27;s German allies lost the Battle of Bouvines, with many prisoners taken, including the Earl of Salisbury. On 18 September, John and Philip agreed to the Truce of Chinon that was intended to last until Easter 1220. In October 1214, John returned to England.

===Capetian invasion of England===

Following the agreement at Runnymede in June 1215, rebel English barons felt that John would not observe the terms of Magna Carta, and offered the English crown to Philip&#x27;s son, Louis. Louis accepted, landing in Kent on 21 May 1216, with 1,200 knights. Louis seized Rochester, London, and Winchester, whilst John was deserted by several nobles, including the Earl of Salisbury. In August, only Dover, Lincoln, and Windsor remained loyal to John in the east, and Alexander II of Scotland travelled to Canterbury to pay homage to Louis.

In September 1216, John began his attack, marching from the Cotswolds, feigning an offensive to relieve the besieged Windsor Castle, and attacking eastwards around London to Cambridge to separate the rebel-held areas of Lincolnshire and East Anglia. In King&#x27;s Lynn, John contracted dysentery. On 18 October 1216, John died.

Louis was defeated twice following John&#x27;s death in 1217, in Lincoln in May, and at Sandwich in August, resulting in his withdrawal from the claim on the throne and England with the Treaty of Lambeth in September.

==Cultural influence==
The hypothetical continuation and expansion of the Angevin Empire over several centuries has been the subject of several tales of alternate history. Historically, both English and French historians had viewed the juxtaposition of England and French lands under Angevin control as something of an aberration and an offence to national identity. To English historians the lands in France were an encumbrance, while French historians considered the union to be an English empire.

The ruling class of the Angevin Empire was French-speaking.

The 12th century is also the century of Gothic architecture, first known as , from the work of the Abbot Suger at Saint Denis in 1140. The Early English Period began around 1180 or 1190, in the times of the Angevin Empire, but this religious architecture was totally independent of the Angevin Empire, it was just born at the same moment and spread at those times in England. Gillingham suggests that it was only &quot;perhaps in kitchen design&quot; that there was a distinctively Angevin style.

Richard I&#x27;s personal arms, three golden lions &quot;passant guardant&quot; on a red field, continue to appear in most subsequent English royal heraldry, and in variations on the flags of both Normandy and Aquitaine.

Politically, during the time of the Angevin Empire, continental issues were given more attention by the Angevin kings of England than British issues had been given previously by the Normans. Under Angevin rule, the balance of power had dramatically shifted to France, with Angevin kings often spending more time in France than England. With the loss of Normandy and Anjou, the Empire was cut in two, leaving Plantagenet descendants to be solely English kings with additional rule over Gascony.

<text>Vedanta Limited is an Indian multinational mining company headquartered in Mumbai, with its main operations in iron ore, gold and aluminium mines in Goa, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Odisha.

==History==
===Sterlite Industries===
Vedanta (then called Sterlite industries) began in the 1980s, as the founder D.P.Agarwal founded Sterlite Industries (India) Limited in Mumbai and begun to buy mining concessions in different states of India. He was soon joined by his two sons, Navin Agarwal and Anil Agarwal, both of whom currently run the company. In 1992, they established Volcan investments in Nassau (Bahamas) as the main holding company for their mines. D.P.Agarwal had a small aluminium conductor business in Patna. His son Anil Agarwal had come to Mumbai to expand their business.

In the 1990s, as the Indian government began to sell off sick (non-performing) companies, Sterlite began to bid for them. They were able to bid successfully for BALCO and Hindustan Zinc Limited, both bankrupt companies that had been closed down for 4 years. Meanwhile, in January 1993, D. P. Agarwal founded Twinstar Holdings Limited in Mauritius, which was mostly owned by Volcan investments. On 26 May 2002, the Enforcement Directorate filed a show cause notice with Sterlite, relating to the six-year period between 1993 and 1999 when Twinstar acquired the shares of Sterlite and various investment companies – such as Dwarka Prasad Anil Kumar Investments Private Limited, Pravin Navin Investment &amp; Trading Private Limited and Sterlite Copper Rolling Mills Private Limited – which, in turn, had made substantial investments in Sterlite and another group company, Madras Aluminium Company Limited (MALCO) after obtaining permission from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). On 29 April 1999, many of these investment companies were liquidated and all the shares of Sterlite came back to Twinstar&#x27;s possession. Twinstar became the 100% owner of shares in these investment companies and received government approvals from the RBI as well as the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).

On 8 December 1999, officials of the Income Tax department raided the offices of Sterlite located at Dhanraj Mahal, Apollo Bunder and Tulsiani Chambers, Mumbai, and seized many documents. The IT department then decided to engage the services of ED officials as it appeared that there could have been a violation of the country&#x27;s foreign exchange laws. After analyzing these documents, the ED inferred that Twinstar was incorporated with the sole intention of acquiring an interest in Sterlite. The Directorate alleged that the Agarwals, before liquidating the shares of the investment companies mentioned, had written off loans worth 230 million and made an agreement to gift their overseas corporate body, Twinstar, a sum of 338 million including shares of Sterlite worth 72 million. Between 1993 and 1999, Sterlite and its investment companies allegedly brought in 2.08 billion to India through Twinstar to subscribe to the shares of Sterlite and make investments in the company.

The company today known as Sesa Goa was founded in 1954, as Scambi Economici SA Goa. Since then, it gradually grew to become a large low-cost producer of iron ore. During 1991–1995, it diversified into the manufacture of pig iron and metallurgical coke. Scambi Economici Societa Anonyma (SESA), owned by Baron Ludovic Toeplitz, with the financial backing of Alessandro Vassalo, obtained the Orasso Dongor mining lease in Sirsaim, Goa in 1954 and Sesa Goa Limited was formed. It was bought over in 1955, with equal shareholding, by Gewerkeshaft Exploration e Bergbau and Ferromin S.p.A., a subsidiary of Finsider S.p.A. (of IRI group), which eventually acquired the other half stake in 1963.

===Sesa Goa (1963–2007)===
Sesa Goa Limited was incorporated as a private limited company in 1963 under The Companies Act, 1956. In 1979, Sesa Goa Private Limited was formed, with the merger of Sesa Goa Limited with another mining company in Goa, Mingoa Sociedade Miniera Goesa S.a.r.l. By 1965, Sesa Goa and Mingoa were incorporated as a private limited company under The Companies Act, 1956. The merger happened in 1979 and the new, unified company was called &#x27;Sesa Goa Pvt Ltd&#x27;. The company went public in 1981 with 42,000 Indian shareholders, holding 60% of its shares and the remaining 40% held by Finsider International, which later became ILVA International. Sesa Goa had started with iron mining as its core business but slowly, it ventured into barge construction in 1984 at Sirsaim, located in the Bardez taluka of North Goa. Since then, the barge construction unit has been developed into a shipbuilding division.

In the 1990s, Sesa Goa began further expansion, aided by an influx of foreign investment during the economic liberalization of India enforced by the World Bank and IMF. In 1992, the first phase of a 150,000 ton pig iron plant was commissioned. In the same year, Sesa introduced India&#x27;s first low-phosphorus foundry grade pig iron in India and subsequently formalised the business under pig iron division. The pig iron plant was located at Amona, Goa and had an annual production capacity of 250,000 tonnes per annum.
Other alliances were formed in the nineties—in January 1995, Sesa Shipping was launched by acquiring a transhipper &quot;M.V. Orissa&quot;. The year also saw the inclusion of 84 new coke ovens. When Mitsui &amp; Co. of Japan bought Finsider International in 1996, it gained 51% stake in Sesa Go. By 1997, Sesa Kembla became a 100% subsidiary of Sesa Goa.

In 1997, A Narrain mines located in Chitradurga, (Karnataka) were purchased. A Supreme Court directive in August 2011 led to suspension of mining activities in the region. In 1999, Sesa Goa started mining operations in Barbil, which has the fifth largest deposit of iron ore and manganese in the world. They started producing iron ore which was exported from the port towns of Haldia and Paradip. During this time, the company also started the Sesa Community Development Foundation that supported the NCM Sesa Technical School and a football academy called SESA F.A.. In March 2024, Supreme Court also rejected a plea for reopening the plant in Tamil Nadu.

During the end of the 90s, the company also began to consolidate through mergers and acquisitions. Sesa Kembla completed the creation of an indigenous and environment-friendly technology that produced high-quality metallurgical coke. This technology generated power as a by-product. In 2003, the Sesa Goa equity in Sesa Industries was raised to 88.25%, impacting the shareholding pattern.

===Take over by Vedanta (2007)===
In 2007, Vedanta Resources Plc, a diversified metals and mining group founded by Anil Agarwal, acquired 51% controlling stake in Sesa Goa Ltd. from Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd. Vedanta Resources is listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of FTSE 100 Index. The deal was worth , making it the largest M&amp;A deal in the industry so far.
In 2009, Sesa Goa acquired Goa-based Dempo Group&#x27;s mining and maritime businesses for in an all-cash deal. This was the second largest acquisition in India&#x27;s iron-ore industry, and it gave Sesa Goa access to Dempo&#x27;s 70 million tons of iron-ore mineable resources in Goa. In 2011, Sesa Goa purchased 51% stake in Western Cluster, Liberia for $90 million.
The Liberia Gola Forest Community people who also suffered from the civil war believe that the coming of Western Cluster will help to alleviate their suffering and provide employment.

In 2007, it became a majority-owned subsidiary of Vedanta Resources Plc, listed on the London Stock Exchange, when Vedanta acquired 51% controlling stake from Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. In June 2009, Sesa Goa Limited acquired VS Dempo &amp; Co. Private Limited (now Sesa Resources Limited) along with its fully owned subsidiary Dempo Mining Corporation (now Vedanta Limited) and 50% equity in Goa Maritime Private Limited. In 2010, Vedanta acquired the zinc assets of British miner Anglo American plc.

In 2011 Vedanta Resources bought 58.5% controlling stake in Cairn India, India&#x27;s largest private sector oil &amp; gas company. In 2015, Sterlite Industries and Sesa Goa announced their merger and finally merged into a single entity in August 2015. In 2015, Sesa Sterlite changed its name to Vedanta Limited. On 11 April 2017, Cairn India merged with Vedanta Limited to consolidate its position as one of the largest diversified natural resources companies in the world.

In 2018 Vedanta Limited acquired control of Electrosteels Steels Limited. Electrosteel Steels had been constructing an integrated steel plant at Siyaljori in Jharkhand.

In May 2020, it is declared that company is going to delist from Indian bourses as per the comment by Mr. Anil Agarwal.

In September 2022, Vedanta signed a pact with Foxconn as a technical partner to invest to set up semiconductor and display production plants in Gujarat. The venture intends to start manufacturing display and chip products within two years. The investment follows the Indian government commitment to expand incentives beyond an initial $10billion plan for those investing in manufacturing of semiconductors. Barely a year later in July 2023 the venture was ended with mutual agreement with both companies maintaining that they are still looking to set up semiconductor foundries in India.

On 24 March 2024, Vedanta Ltd announced a $6 billion investment across various business verticals, including aluminium, zinc, iron ore, steel, and oil and gas, aiming to add at least $2.5 billion to its annual EBITDA. The investment is part of a strategy involving over 50 active projects expected to generate additional revenues of over $6 billion, with plans for a significant vertical split leading to the creation of five newly listed companies.

===Tuticorin Sterlite protests===
In early 2018, thousands of residents of Tuticorin began to protest against the Sterlite plant located in the industrial complex there. The protests continued for three months and began to draw the attention of the media as well as local political parties who began to instigate as well as mobilise locals. Most of the protests were related to what locals perceived to be pollution from the Sterlite factory. The managers of Sterlite countered that there were another four similar plants adjacent to them, and that they were complying with all government regulations. There was little equipment, either with the plant or with the government to take actual measurements of the air in the vicinity. Sterlite further countered that contrary to the rumours that were being circulated, they did not pump any water from the plant into the sea which lay more than 10 kilometers away. In April 2018, the Government of Tamil Nadu placed an order to close down the factory. This order was temporarily cancelled by the district collector.

In May 2018, amidst ongoing protests by thousands of people, matters turned rough one day and the police opened fire on demonstrators.

<text>Torture Squad is a Brazilian death/thrash metal band, founded in 1990.

==History==
Three years after being founded in 1990, the band entered a more professional phase, in a line-up with founder Cristiano Fusco on guitar, Wagner &quot;Castor&quot; on bass, Amilcar Christofaro on drums, and Vitor Rodrigues as frontman and singer. They started touring in and around São Paulo and soon recorded a demo, released in 1993, &quot;A Soul in Hell&quot;. Their first CD was &quot;Shivering&quot; (1995); their break-through came with &quot;Asylum of Shadows&quot; (1999).

Their 2001 album, &quot;The Unholy Spell&quot;, came right after the band&#x27;s first tour in Germany. 
In 2002, Cristiano Fusco left the band, and the band hired Mauricio Nogueira (a seasoned studio musician who played for Krisiun as well as other local bands like In Hell and Zoltar), and went on their first Brazilian tour.

&quot;Pandemonium&quot; produced by Marcello Pompeu and Heros Trench (Korzus) was released in 2003. The CD was supported by a TV video clip for &quot;Pandemonium&quot; and &quot;Horror and Torture.&quot; Again, the band played all over Brazil. Then, in 2006 Torture Squad embarked on a European tour, headlining in 16 towns in Germany and 4 in Austria. Afterward they played in more cities in Brazil until they participated in the Brazilian pre-selection for the famed Wacken Open Air festival. They eventually won the final in São Paulo, and they represented Brazil at Wacken Battle of the Bands 2007, which they won. This victory won them a contract with Armageddon Records (Germany); Mauricio Nogueira also won the &quot;best guitar player&quot; award, which earned him a brand new Dean guitar and a Marshall pre-amp.

&quot;Hellbound&quot;, was released in May 2008 by Armageddon, not long after Mauricio Nogueira left the band for personal reasons and Augusto Lopes (Eternal Malediction) was announced as the new guitarist. In 2008, Torture Squad embarked on a 60-date European tour, which will include a show at Wacken Open Air.

The year of 2009 started pretty well for Torture Squad. After the release of Hellbound and its excellent repercussion in Brazil, Europe and the United States, it was followed by a European tour with two of the world&#x27;s major thrash metal bands, Overkill and Exodus. The tour began in mid February in London, where the Brazilian group performed for the first time, and included 12 more shows in countries like Spain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the Czech Republic.

Their album “AEquilibrium” was released in Europe in August 2010 by Wacken Records / H&#x27;art / Zebralution / SAOL. They recorded a new version for the title track of their third album “The Unholy Spell” which is included as bonus track with the title of “The Unholy Spell 2010”. The album was recorded in São Paulo/Brazil, at Norcal Studios with producers Brendan Duffey and Adriano Daga.

In January 2011, guitarist Augusto Lopes left the band and was replaced by André Evaristo. Even with the line up changing, the band did not stop, remaining on the road until July of the same year. One month later, the band crossed the ocean again, for the European part of the Æquilibrium Tour 2011, with more than 40 concerts in 12 countries until the end of October, including the third concert on the German festival Wacken Open Air, turning Torture Squad into the only Brazilian band to play three times at the festival.

In March 2012, the frontman Vitor Rodrigues left the band. Soon after that, the band turned out to be a power trio with André Evaristo taking the lead vocals along with the guitar. With this line up they played with important concerts and festivals in South America, which is held in Quito city, the capital city of Ecuador, for an approximate audience of 25,000 people.

In 2013, the band celebrated the 20th anniversary of the release of the demo-tape A Soul in Hell, their first studio recording, which was celebrated in the Twenty Years Torturing People Tour
1993–2013, that started in May in Europe, alongside Artillery, Gama Bomb and Tantara, with 18 concerts in 20 days. From April to August, 2013, the band chose, again, Norcal Studios to record their seventh studio album, &quot;Esquadrão de Tortura&quot; (Torture Squad in Portuguese), and reprising the association with Brendan Duffey and Adriano Daga as producers. &quot;Esquadrão de Torture&quot; was the first work recorded by the band as a trio and the first lyrical concept album, narrating, in chronological order, the period in which Brazil was governed by a military regime (from 1964 to 1985), being also the first album to have a title in Portuguese. The official release date was November 15, Brazil&#x27;s Republic Proclamation Day.

In July and August 2014, the band did their second South American tour with thirteen shows in four countries; Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Paraguay. Finishing the year in their hometown São Paulo / SP on December, 20, recording its show which was released in mid 2015 on DVD and CD and titled “Coup d´État Live”. In September 2015, vocalist / guitarist André Evaristo left Torture Squad to pursue other personal projects, bringing the band back to its traditional line-up as a quartet featuring Mayara “Undead” Puertas on vocals and Rene Simionato on guitars, continuing the tour of “Coup D´État Live”. Already with their new line up, the band went to studio to record the EP “Return of Evil”, with four songs: the new “Return of Evil”, “Swallow Your Reality” and “Iron Squad”, and the new version of “Dreadful Lies”, originally released in the 1998 first album &quot;Shivering&quot;. The EP will also had a multimedia track with the video clip of “Return of the Evil” and a mini documentary of the EP recording sessions, and the videos of “Dreadful Lies” and “Iron Squad” exclusively made for the EP, which was released in February 2016.

In September 2016, the band made a historic tour in Brazil playing 28 gigs in 32 days throughout the country from north to south. Soon after the Brazilian tour, the band did a European tour comprising 19 gigs in seven countries. The Return of Evil tour finished in February 2017, doing 13 shows during 16 days in the country side of São Paulo and Paraná.

In April 2017, the band started the recording of their eighth album entitled &quot;Far Beyond Existence&quot; released on July 13 (World Rock Day). In August 2017, they started the Far Beyond Existence Tour as headliner, alongside Brazilian bands Hatefulmurder, Warcursed and Reckoning Hour, performing 26 shows in 30 days all over Brazil. In November, after seven years, the band returned to Buenos Aires / Argentina for a mini tour of four dates.

Starting the year 2018, the band returned to the road. The &quot;Zumbis Squad Tour&quot; undertook eight shows in the country side of São Paulo in February. In March, the band made another South American tour, playing in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile.

<doc id="1256787" wikidata="Q1906721" url="?curid=1256787" title="Masahiro Sakurai">
<text>is a Japanese video game director and game designer best known as the creator of the &quot;Kirby&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. Apart from his work on those series, he also led the design of &quot;Meteos&quot; in 2005 and directed &quot;Kid Icarus: Uprising&quot; in 2012.

Formerly an employee of HAL Laboratory, Sakurai left the company in 2003 and in 2005 with his wife Michiko Sakurai (also ex-HAL Laboratory) founded their company , under which they work on a freelance basis. He was also an author of a weekly column for &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine from 2003 to 2021, and has done voice acting work in some of his games, most notably providing the voice of King Dedede in &quot;Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards&quot; and the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. From 2022 to 2024, Sakurai ran an educational YouTube channel, &quot;Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games&quot;, which discussed various topics in game design and his career.

==Career==
Masahiro Sakurai was born on August 3, 1970, in Musashimurayama, Tokyo, Japan. One of Sakurai&#x27;s earliest experiences in the video game industry began when he worked for HAL Laboratory, where he created the character Kirby at age 19 and directed his first title, &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot;.

Sakurai left HAL on August 5, 2003. He explained in an interview with &quot;Nintendo Dream&quot; that he felt it would be difficult to create new projects while staying at HAL due to the direction of the gaming industry, where the risk of failure was high. While he was not being pressured by HAL to create &quot;Kirby&quot; sequels, he noted increasing tension within the industry as a whole: &quot;It was tough for me to see that every time I made a new game, people automatically assumed that a sequel was coming. Even if it&#x27;s a sequel, lots of people have to give their all to make a game, but some people think the sequel process happens naturally.&quot;

Soon after, Sakurai began working on a project with Q Entertainment, along with Tetsuya Mizuguchi. This collaboration resulted in &quot;Meteos&quot; in 2005, a puzzle game for the Nintendo DS. On September 30, 2005, Sakurai announced that he had formed his own company, Sora Ltd. Two games were announced to be in development but no information on the titles had been divulged. As for the future of the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, Nintendo and HAL Laboratory president Satoru Iwata, during Nintendo&#x27;s E3 2005 press conference, promised an online iteration of the game would come to the Nintendo Wii.

In issue #885 of &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine, Sakurai revealed that he would be serving as a director and game designer on &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; for the Wii. &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; was released in 2008, after personnel borrowed from 19 different developer studios assisted in development. Sakurai had been updating daily the &quot;Super Smash Bros Brawl&quot; website called the Smash Bros. Dojo. Starting a year previous the release, he revealed &quot;Brawl&quot; secrets and gameplay content through the site. The Smash Bros. Dojo had regular updates from May 22, 2007, to April 14, 2008.

On the final day of updates, it was revealed that Sakurai provided the voice for King Dedede in &quot;Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards&quot; as well as Dedede in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;. He and his company, Sora Ltd. alongside Nintendo, started a first-party studio, Project Sora, which was 72% owned by Nintendo and 28% owned by Sora Ltd. It was revealed at E3 2010 that Sakurai and Project Sora were working on &quot;Kid Icarus: Uprising&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS. Project Sora was closed and ended development on June 30, 2012. At E3 2011, Nintendo announced that Sakurai was working on &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;. Sakurai began development of the title upon the release of &quot;Kid Icarus: Uprising&quot; in March 2012.

In February 2013, Sakurai was diagnosed with calcific tendinitis near his right shoulder, which caused him substantial pain whenever he moved his arm. He mentioned that this could effectively slow down his work, as he does some of his game testing himself. Sakurai&#x27;s wife, Michiko, has worked on the graphical user interface for many of his games, including &quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot;, &quot;Meteos&quot;, and the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

In a January 2015 column in &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot;, Sakurai alluded to the possibility of retirement, expressing doubt that he would be able to continue making games if his career continued to be as stressful as it was. In December 2015, Sakurai once again stated that he was not sure if there would be another game in the &quot;Smash Bros.&quot; series, prior to &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; being released in 2018 with Sakurai once again as director.

On March 14, 2022, Sakurai was awarded Best Creator by &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot;. Sakurai also announced that he was working on a new project not related to game production.

===&quot;Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games&quot;===
Sakurai launched &quot;Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games&quot;, a YouTube channel in both English and Japanese in August 2022. The channel&#x27;s videos are focused on game development and design as well as his career. He stated that the channel was founded because he wanted to reach more people with his lessons after being asked to lecture at schools. Sakurai additionally noted that other venues for lessons from game developers, such as the Game Developers Conference, focused on more advanced, technical details, rather than more basic principles.

Work on the channel began immediately after the release of Sora in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; in 2021. Sakurai wrote and pre-recorded all videos before starting work on a new development project in April 2022, and contracted Hike Inc. for editing and 8-4 for English localization. The opening and ending jingles for the channel were composed by Yuzo Koshiro. Sakurai estimates that the total production cost was 90,000,000.

Less than a day after its launch, the English edition of his channel gained over 200,000 subscribers. In 2023, the Computer Entertainment Supplier&#x27;s Association announced that Sakurai had won the Game Design and Visual Arts awards for his channel. The association cited his efforts to share his knowledge in an easily understood manner.

<doc id="1256791" wikidata="Q1057179" url="?curid=1256791" title="User guide">
<text>A user guide, also commonly known as a user manual, is intended to assist users in using a particular product, service or application. It is usually written by a technician, product developer, or a company&#x27;s customer service staff.

Most user guides contain both a written guide and associated images. In the case of computer applications, it is usual to include screenshots of the human-machine interface(s), and hardware manuals often include clear, simplified diagrams. The language used is matched to the intended audience, with jargon kept to a minimum or explained thoroughly.

==Contents of a user manual==
The sections of a user manual often include:
*A cover page
*A title page and copyright page
*A preface, containing details of related documents and information on how to navigate the user guide
*A contents page
*A Purpose section. This should be an overview rather than detail the objective of the document
*An Audience section to explicitly state who is the intended audience who is required to read, including optionals
*A Scope section is crucial as it also serves as a disclaimer, stating what is out-of-scope as well as what is covered
*A guide on how to use at least the main function of the system
*A troubleshooting section detailing possible errors or problems that may occur, along with how to fix them
*A FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
*Where to find further help, and contact details 
*A glossary and, for larger documents, an index

== History ==

User guides have been found with ancient devices. One example is the Antikythera Mechanism, a 2,000 year old Greek analogue computer that was found off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in the year 1900. On the cover of this device are passages of text which describe the features and operation of the mechanism.

As the software industry was developing, the question of how to best document software programs was undecided. This was a unique problem for software developers, since users often became frustrated with current help documents. Some considerations for writing a user guide that developed at this time include:

* the use of plain language
* length and reading difficulty
* the role of printed user guides for digital programs
* user-centered design

==Computer software manuals and guides==

Before Unix, for example, GCOS, mainframe documentation were printed pages, available on-premise to users (staff, students...), organized into steel binders, locked together in one monolithic steel reading rack, bolted to a table or counter, with pages organized for modular information updates, replacement, errata, and addenda. 

User manuals and user guides for most non-trivial PC and browser software applications are book-like documents with contents similar to the above list. They may be distributed either in print or electronically. Some documents have a more fluid structure with many internal links. The &quot;Google Earth User Guide&quot; is an example of this format. The term &quot;guide&quot; is often applied to a document that addresses a specific aspect of a software product. Some usages are &quot;Installation Guide&quot;, &quot;Getting Started Guide&quot;, and various &quot;How to&quot; guides. An example is the &quot;Picasa Getting Started Guide&quot;.

In some business software applications, where groups of users have access to only a sub-set of the application&#x27;s full functionality, a user guide may be prepared for each group. An example of this approach is the &quot;Autodesk Topobase 2010 Help&quot; document, which contains separate &quot;Administrator Guides&quot;, &quot;User Guides&quot;, and a &quot;Developer&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

<text>The S4C Authority () is an independent public body appointed by the United Kingdom Government&#x27;s Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to oversee the management of the Welsh-language television channel S4C. Although an independent body, the authority works in conjunction with the UK-wide broadcasting and telecommunications regulator Ofcom, who have responsibility for regulating S4C&#x27;s output.

In the spending review which he presented to the House of Commons on 20 October 2010, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced that part of the responsibility for funding S4C was to be transferred to the BBC. On 10 August 2012, the BBC Trust, Ofcom and the S4C Authority launched a public consultation on a draft Operating Agreement concluded between the two broadcasters and setting out their relationship from 1 April 2013, the date following which it is intended that most of S4C&#x27;s funding will come from the BBC licence fee.

<doc id="1256797" wikidata="Q3643357" url="?curid=1256797" title="Blunsdon">
<text>Blunsdon is a civil parish in the Borough of Swindon, in Wiltshire, England, about north of the centre of Swindon, with the A419 forming its southern boundary. Its main settlement is the village of Broad Blunsdon, with Lower Blunsdon nearby; the hamlet of Broadbush is now contiguous with Broad Blunsdon.

Blunsdon is the eastern half of the former Blunsdon St Andrew civil parish. In April 2017, that parish was divided and the western half became a new St Andrews parish.

==History==
Blunsdon dates from Roman times: it was discovered that a Roman travellers&#x27; resting place existed on the site of the present-day Cold Harbour public house. The main A419 road follow the course of a Roman road known as Ermin Street that linked the historic Roman towns of Gloucester (Glevum) and Silchester (Calleva Atrebatum), via Cirencester (Corinium).

The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded three estates at &quot;Bluntesdone&quot;, with altogether ten households. The L-shaped manor house, just west of the church, was built and enlarged in the 17th century; it has two fireplaces from c.1600, and a staircase also from that century.
Blunsdon Abbey was a Gothic mansion built near Blunsdon St Andrew church in 1858–1860 for wealthy sportsman Joseph Clayton de Windt, on the site of an earlier house. It was destroyed by fire in 1904 and remains as a ruin, with parts of the stable block – including a square tower – standing.

Two areas of Broad Blunsdon village, one encompassing the church, were designated as a conservation area in 1990.

===Widhill===
Widhill, land lying north of Blunsdon St Andrew as far as the Roman road and bounded to the west by the River Ray, appears in Domesday Book as two estates at &quot;Wildehill&quot; with altogether 14 households. The area became a tithing of the parish of St Sampson, Cricklade, and for a time a small chapel served the two small settlements at Lower Widhill and Upper Widhill (sometimes North Widhill and West Widhill respectively). Robert Jenner, who prospered as a silver merchant in London, bought Widhill manor in 1624; the Jenner family remained at Widhill until the manor was sold in 1826.

In the late 19th century Widhill became part of Cricklade civil parish, then was transferred to Blunsdon in 1934; its population at the 1931 census had been 21.

Today, Lower Widhill Farm, Chapel Farm and Upper Widhill Farm survive in the strip of farmland between the north edge of Blunsdon St Andrew and the A419.

==Parish church==

St Leonard&#x27;s, the Church of England parish church, is in the north-east of the village. The stone rubble building has 13th-century origins, seen in the four-bay south arcade and a small two-light window in the south aisle. The west tower is from the 15th century; the elaborate wooden screen under the tower is 17th-century. A monument to John Potenger (died 1733), in white and grey marble with cherub heads, is signed by Peter Scheemakers.

William Butterfield carried out extensive restoration in 1870, when the chancel was rebuilt and the south-east chapel and north-east vestry were added. The building was designated as Grade II* listed in 1955.

There is a ring of eight bells, cast in 1913 and 2002. The stone-built former rectory, east of the church, was built in 1867–1868 to designs of Ewan Christian. Today the parish is within the benefice of Highworth with Sevenhampton and Inglesham and Hannington, centred on St Michael&#x27;s church at Highworth.

==Sport==
Blunsdon&#x27;s Abbey Stadium (also known as Swindon Stadium) is the home of Swindon Greyhounds, broadcast world-wide three times per week and a stalwart of off course betting shops in the UK all the year round. The stadium has also been the home of a speedway team, the Swindon Robins, since it opened in 1949. The Robins competed in national leagues, including the Elite League in the 21st century, but did not race in 2021 or 2022 due to long-running uncertainty over redevelopment of the site.

The village has a football team, Blunsdon FC, which has youth development squads as well as senior ladies and men&#x27;s sides playing in the Wiltshire League.

==Government==
Blunsdon parish covers Broad Blunsdon and the area west of the A419. In the southeast, the boundary with St Andrews leaves the A419 and follows the A4311 Cricklade Road, so that the Groundwell industrial estate is in Blunsdon parish.

Until April 2017, the whole area was the civil parish of Blunsdon St Andrew. The parish lies within the Borough of Swindon, and is part of the Blunsdon and Highworth ward for elections to Swindon Borough Council.

==Shop==
After the last privately owned shop in the village closed in 2002, a village public meeting convened and agreed to open a new community shop, which was opened in 2003. Located in the car park of the village hall, the shop was originally based inside a secondhand site office cabin, but in 2009 this was replaced by a brand new structure. Run mainly by volunteers, in 2010 the shop won third place for &#x27;Best Village Shop&#x27; at the Wiltshire Life Magazine Awards. In 2023, the shop moved to a new premises at Unit 1, Blunt Rise, Blunsdon, SN26 7DA and expanded to include a cafe.

==Transport==

The Swindon and Cricklade Railway has rebuilt Blunsdon railway station, just outside the parish boundary.

A bypass was built between the autumn of 2006 and spring 2009. This reunited Broad Blunsdon village with the portion that was southwest of the former A419.

==Notable people==
Margaret de Windt (1849–1836), daughter of the builder of Blunsdon Abbey, married the White Rajah Charles Brooke and thus became Ranee of Sarawak. Her brother Harry (1856–1933) was an explorer and travel writer.

<doc id="1256799" wikidata="Q333719" url="?curid=1256799" title="Lee Child">
<text>James Dover Grant (born 29 October 1954), primarily known by his pen name Lee Child, is a British author who writes thriller novels, and is best known for his &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; novel series. The books follow the adventures of a former American military policeman, Jack Reacher, who wanders the United States. His first novel, &quot;Killing Floor&quot; (1997), won both the Anthony Award and the 1998 Barry Award for Best First Novel.

==Early life and education==
Grant was born in Coventry. His Northern Irish father, who was born in Belfast, was a civil servant who lived in the house where the singer Van Morrison was later born. He is the second of four sons; his younger brother, Andrew Grant, is also a thriller novelist. Grant&#x27;s family moved to Handsworth Wood in Birmingham when he was four years old so that the boys could receive a better education. Grant attended Cherry Orchard Primary School in Handsworth Wood until the age of 11. He attended King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham.

In 1974, at the age of 20, Grant studied law at University of Sheffield, though he had no intention of entering the legal profession. During his student days, he worked backstage in a theatre. After graduating, he worked in commercial television. He received a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from the University of Sheffield in 1977 and returned to the university to receive an honorary Doctor of Letters (DLitt) in 2009.

==Career==

===Television production career===

Grant joined Granada Television, part of the UK&#x27;s ITV Network, in Manchester as a presentation director. There he was involved with shows including &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, &quot;Prime Suspect&quot;, and &quot;Cracker&quot;. Grant was involved in the transmission of more than 40,000 hours of programming for Granada, writing thousands of commercials and news stories. He worked at Granada from 1977 to 1995 and ended his career there with two years as a trade union shop steward.

===Writing career===
After losing his job because of corporate restructuring, Grant decided to start writing novels, which he later called &quot;purest form of entertainment.&quot; In 1997, his first novel, &quot;Killing Floor&quot;, was published. Child moved to the United States, where he married a New Yorker. He starts each new book of the series on an anniversary of his starting the first book after losing his job.

His pen name &quot;Lee&quot; comes from a mispronunciation of the name of Renault&#x27;s Le Car, as &quot;Lee Car&quot;. Calling anything &quot;Lee&quot; became a family gag. His daughter, Ruth, was &quot;lee child&quot;. The name has the advantage of placing his books alphabetically on bookshop and library shelves between crime fiction greats Raymond Chandler and Agatha Christie. 

Grant has said that he came up with the name Reacher for the central character in his novels when he was grocery shopping with his wife Jane at Asda supermarket in Kendal, Cumbria, when he was living at Kirkby Lonsdale. Grant&#x27;s height often leads to people asking him to get something for them from a high shelf. Jane once joked: &quot;&#x27;Hey, if this writing thing doesn&#x27;t pan out, you could always be a reacher in a supermarket.&#x27; ... &#x27;I thought, Reacher – good name.&#x27;&quot;

Some books in the &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; series are written in the first person, while others are written in the third person. Grant has characterised the books as revenge stories – &quot;Somebody does a very bad thing, and Reacher takes revenge&quot; – driven by his anger at the downsizing at Granada. Although English, he deliberately chose to write American-style thrillers.
In 2007, Grant collaborated with 14 other writers to create the 17-part serial thriller &quot;The Chopin Manuscript&quot;, narrated by Alfred Molina. This was broadcast weekly on Audible.com between 25 September 2007 and 13 November 2007.

Grant worked as a visiting professor at the University of Sheffield from November 2008. In 2009, Grant funded 52 Jack Reacher scholarships for students at the university.

Grant was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America in 2009. Grant was the Programming Chair for the Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival in 2018, part of the Harrogate International Festivals portfolio.

In 2019, it was announced that Child would curate a new TV show called &quot;Lee Child: True Crime.&quot; The show will dramatise real-life crime stories from around the world and focus on average people who go to extraordinary lengths to fight crime or seek justice.

In January 2020, Child announced that he would retire from writing the &quot;Jack Reacher&quot; series and hand it to his brother Andrew Grant, who would write further books of the series under the surname Child. He intended to write the next few books with Grant before passing the series entirely over to him.

===Writing style===
Grant&#x27;s prose has been described as &quot;hardboiled&quot; and &quot;commercial&quot; in style. In a 2012 interview, Grant said many aspects of the Jack Reacher novels were meant to maintain the books&#x27; profitability, rather than for literary reasons. For instance, Jack Reacher was given one French parent in part to increase the series&#x27; appeal in France. The interviewer wrote that Grant &quot;didn&#x27;t apologise about the commercial nature&quot; of his fiction.

Child has listed John D. MacDonald, Alistair MacLean, and Robert B. Parker as influences on the Reacher series.

===Other activities===
In 2019, Child collaborated with musicians Jennifer and Scott Smith of the group Naked Blue on an album of music exploring Jack Reacher, in song. He contributed vocals to the track &quot;Reacher Said Nothing.&quot;

In 2020 Child joined the Booker Prize judging panel, alongside chair Margaret Busby, Sameer Rahim, Lemn Sissay, and Emily Wilson.

==Philanthropy==
In January 2012, Grant donated £10,000 for a new vehicle for the Brecon Mountain Rescue Team in Wales.

Grant is an annual sponsor and original member of ThrillerFest.

==Personal life==
Grant married his wife Jane in 1974. They have a daughter, Ruth. They moved to New York state in 1998 at the beginning of his writing career. 

Grant is a fan of Aston Villa Football Club; his books sometimes include the names of Aston Villa players.

In 2013, Grant rejected claims that he wrote while under the influence of marijuana that were initially reported in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

<text>Tirurangadi is a municipal town in Malappuram district of the Indian state Kerala. It is a historic town famed for its active participation in the freedom struggle, especially those dating back to the 1920s. It serves as a local taluk and is located, 30 km south of Calicut and 140 km north of Ernakulam.

==History==
Tirurangadi, which was then an important centre of trade, was known by the name &quot;Tiruwarankad&quot; to the Arabs, during the middle ages. It was ruled by the Misba Arien during the Middle ages. Later in 18th century, the region came under the Kingdom of Mysore. The Battle of Tirurangadi was a series of engagements that took place between the British army and Tipu Sultan, the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore, between 7 and 12 December 1790 at Tirurangadi, during the Third Anglo-Mysore War.

Mysore rule was followed by British Raj at the end of 18th century CE. &quot;Cheranad&quot; was a name of an erstwhile province in the kingdom of Zamorin of Calicut, which had included parts of present-day Tirurangadi and Tirur Taluks of Malappuram district in it. Later it became a Taluk of Malabar District, when Malabar came under the British Raj. The headquarters of &quot;Cheranad Taluk&quot; was the town of Tirurangadi. Later the Taluk was merged with Eranad Taluk.

Tirurangadi was one of the main centres of Malabar Rebellion of 1921. The Tirurangadi Taluk Office, which was an important administrative centre during British Raj, is also a monument of the rebellion.

When Tirur Taluk was formed in 1957, Tirurangadi block became a part of it. Later in the 1990s, Vengara and Tirurangadi Revenue blocks were separated to form the modern Tirurangadi Taluk.

<doc id="1256815" wikidata="Q2925745" url="?curid=1256815" title="British Nationality Act 1981">
<text>The British Nationality Act 1981(c. 61) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom concerning British nationality since 1 January 1983.

==History==

In the mid-1970s the British Government decided to update the nationality code, which had been significantly amended since the British Nationality Act 1948 came into force on 1 January 1949. In 1977, a Green Paper was produced by the Labour government outlining options for reform of the nationality code. This was followed in 1980 by a White Paper by the Conservative government that closely followed the Labour proposals. William Whitelaw, the Home Secretary under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was the chief author. The &quot;British Nationality Act 1981&quot; received Royal Assent on 30 October 1981 and came into force on 1 January 1983. Both major parties were in agreement on the new law.

Subsequently, the British Nationality Act has been significantly amended, including:

* British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983
* Hong Kong Act 1985 and &quot;Hong Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986&quot; 
* British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990, which introduced the British Nationality Selection Scheme
* Hong Kong (War Wives and Widows) Act 1996
* British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997
* Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999
* British Overseas Territories Act 2002
* Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002
* Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006
* Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009
* Citizenship (Armed Forces) Act 2014
* Nationality and Borders Act 2022
* British Nationality (Regularisation of Past Practice) Act 2023
* British Nationality (Irish Citizens) Act 2024

==Objectives of the Act==

===Reclassification of United Kingdom and Colonies citizenship===
The Act reclassified &quot;Citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC)&quot; into three categories:

* British citizenship 
* British Dependent Territories citizenship (BDTC); and 
* British Overseas citizenship.

In 1968, with the passage of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 to modify the wording of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, some CUKCs were stripped of the Right of Abode in the United Kingdom. The Act sought to restore once again the link between citizenship and right of abode by providing that British citizenship—held by those with a close connection with either the United Kingdom or with the Crown Dependencies (that is to say, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), or both—would &quot;automatically&quot; carry a right of abode in the UK. The other categories of British nationality would not hold such status based on nationality, although in some cases would do so under the immigration laws.

Whilst in opposition in 1977, the Conservative Party asked Edward Gardner to chair a study group to provide advice on changes to the nationality laws. The resultant Green paper, &quot;Who Do We Think We Are?&quot;, was published in 1980 and its threefold definition of nationality formed the basis for the Government&#x27;s legislation. Originally the paper proposed just two categories of British nationality, British citizenship and British Overseas citizenship. However, the British Dependent Territory governments successfully lobbied for an additional category of nationality, which would cater for those with close connections to any of the British territories.

===Modification of &quot;jus soli&quot;===
The Act also modified the application of &quot;jus soli&quot; (“right of soil”, that is, place of birth) as defining British nationality. Prior to the Act coming into force, any person born in the United Kingdom or a colony (with limited exceptions such as children of diplomats and enemy aliens) was entitled to CUKC status. After the Act came into force, it was necessary for at least one parent of a United Kingdom-born child to be a British citizen, a British Dependent Territories citizen &quot;or&quot; &quot;settled&quot; in the United Kingdom or a colony (a permanent resident).

Even following the coming into force of the Act, the vast majority of children born in the United Kingdom or colonies still acquire British nationality at birth. Special provisions are made for non-British UK-born children to acquire British citizenship in certain circumstances.

===Relation to Immigration Act 1971===

Under section 11(1) of the Act, a CUKC must have had the right of abode under the Immigration Act 1971, as it existed on 31 December 1982, to become a British citizen on 1 January 1983 automatically under the standard CUKC transition at commencement route of the Act.

Section 39 of the Act then went on to modify the right of abode section of the 1971 measure, eliminating confusing wording as to whether right of abode could be obtained through a grandparent who was a CUKC from outside the UK. 

Some people born in the UK after 1983 may have been incorrectly told they were not eligible for a British passport, if their mother had been born in a Commonwealth country (e.g. Canada, or Australia) to a British-born grandparent, but later returned to the UK. In this case, the parent would have retained right of abode from the grandparent, meaning they were already settled at the time of the child&#x27;s birth (irrespective of whether they themselves were British nationals).

===Other changes===
The Act made a variety of other changes to the law:

* Mothers as well as fathers were allowed to pass on British nationality to their (UK born) children. However, until 2006, British parents of children born outside the UK (or in the UK to a non-British mother) had to be married.
* The term Commonwealth citizen was used to replace British subject. Under the Act, the term British subject was restricted to certain persons holding British nationality through connections with British India or the Republic of Ireland before 1949.
* Right of Abode could no longer be acquired by non-British citizens. A limited number of Commonwealth citizens holding Right of Abode were allowed to retain it (for example, those born before 1983 to a British parent in a Commonwealth country which had not left, or had membership suspended since then).
* The rights of Commonwealth and Irish citizens to become British citizens by &quot;registration&quot; were removed and instead they were to be expected to apply for &quot;naturalisation&quot; if they wanted to acquire British citizenship. Irish citizens, however, who were, or claim British subject nationality retain their right to acquire British citizenship nationality through registration.
* Special provision was made for persons from Gibraltar to acquire British citizenship. Since 2002, this mainly relates to EU nationals who have acquired Overseas Territory Citizen status to live in Gibraltar.
* Foreign spouses were treated equally under the law. Wives of British men could no longer acquire British nationality purely by marriage and husbands of British women were afforded the right to acquire British nationality on equal terms.
* British Crown Colonies were renamed &quot;British Dependent Territories&quot; (subsequently amended to &quot;British Overseas Territories&quot;)
* The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, references to which had been construed as references to colonies under the British Nationality Act 1948, were now to be construed as being part of the United Kingdom for nationality purposes.

In some cases, transitional arrangements were made that preserved certain aspects of the old legislation. Most of these expired on 31 December 1987, five years after the Act came into force.

==Legal principles==
===Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 &amp; 1968===
The Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 made a number of changes to the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, beginning with amending the definition of to whom the Act applied. By comparison:

Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962:

Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968:

The stripping of birth rights from Bermudians by the British Government in 1968 and 1971, and the change of their citizenship in 1983, actually violated the rights granted them by Royal charters at the founding of the colony. Bermuda (fully &quot;The Somers Isles or Islands of Bermuda&quot;) had been settled by the London Company (which had been in occupation of the archipelago since the 1609 wreck of the Sea Venture) in 1612, when it received its Third Royal Charter from King James I, amending the boundaries of the First Colony of Virginia far enough across the Atlantic to include Bermuda. The citizenship rights guaranteed to settlers by King James I in the original Royal Charter of 10 April 1606, thereby applied to Bermudians:

These rights were confirmed in the Royal Charter granted to the London Company&#x27;s spin-off, the Company of the City of London for the Plantacion of The Somers Isles, in 1615 on Bermuda being separated from Virginia:

Bermuda is not the only territory whose citizenship rights were laid down in a Royal Charter. In regards to St. Helena, Lord Beaumont of Whitley in the House of Lords debate on the &quot;British Overseas Territories Bill&quot; on 10 July 2001, stated:

==After the Act==
After the Falklands War, full British citizenship was granted to the Falkland Islanders by the British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983. Gibraltarians were also permitted to retain full British citizenship.

== Criticism ==
Critics argued that one of the main political motivations behind the new law was to deny most Hong Kong-born ethnic Chinese the right of residency in the United Kingdom in the years preceding the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, and later the handover of Hong Kong (then the largest British colony by population) to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997.

However, CUKCs from Hong Kong had lost their right of abode in the United Kingdom in 1968, unless they were already resident in the United Kingdom before the Commonwealth Immigrants Act. This decision would eventually be reversed in 2021.

Special provisions made in the Act (for those who do not have another nationality and for those who lived a long time in the United Kingdom) means there is little pressure for any change to the current law. Similar legislation was later enacted in Australia (1986), the Republic of Ireland (2004) and New Zealand (2005).

<doc id="1256817" wikidata="Q5462165" url="?curid=1256817" title="Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary">
<text>The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) is a United States National Marine Sanctuary located off of Galveston, Texas, in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico. It contains the northernmost coral reefs in the United States.

Underlying salt domes forced the seafloor upward in various areas of the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the formation of seamounts and ocean banks. Conditions of the Gulf of Mexico were conducive to reef-building, which started roughly ten to fifteen thousand years ago.

Two reefs, East Flower Garden Bank (EFGB) and West Flower Garden Bank (WFGB), made up Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS) when it was initially created in 1992. In 1996, Stetson Bank was added to the sanctuary. The three banks are not contiguous.

The sanctuary contains many aquatic species. Almost three hundred species of fish and over twenty species of coral are found in the sanctuary along with a wide variety of crustaceans, sponges, and plants. FGBNMS provides habitat for many protected and/or threatened species including marine mammals, sharks, rays, and sea turtles. Many fish species important to recreational and commercial fisheries inhabit the banks.
The sanctuary&#x27;s administrative offices and laboratories are located in a part of the former Fort Crockett in Galveston, Texas. Research Vessel MANTA is also located in Galveston, and provides a working platform for researchers. A system of mooring buoys, which reduces resource impacts from anchoring, is maintained by FGBNMS staff.

Since 2011, the Foundation funded annual scientific cruise ships to monitor the health of the coral in the sanctuary. Researchers record conditions and detect early warning signs consisting of different impacts of climate change and possible environmental crime. Scientists use the long-term data to establish baselines, understand changes and assess why reefs become unhealthy. This ongoing record was priceless in 2016 when the Sanctuary discovered a vast coral die-off in its East Bank. While the event has stabilized, the Foundation continues to dedicate additional funding to support further observation. The Foundation also funds economic impact studies on commercial and recreational activity in the area to understand use and inform protection planning and potential expansion.

== History ==

The ocean banks comprising FGBNMS were first mapped in 1936, when EFGB, WFGB, and Stetson Bank were included in a hydrographic survey of the Gulf of Mexico conducted by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. These initial surveys, along with others conducted in the 1950s, led researchers to conclude that the banks originated when salt domes forced overlaying sediments upward to form seamounts.

Before the early 1960s it was debated whether coral reefs could develop off the Texas coast; some researchers predicted the area would be too cold, or too turbid to support any extensive reef development. A series of scientific scuba diving expeditions, however, revealed that EFGB and WFGB did indeed support extensive coral reef systems. The late 1960s saw the establishment of the Flower Gardens Ocean Research Center (FGORC), a scientific facility whose research inspired federal agencies to begin discussing protecting the banks from human activities, including oil and gas extraction, fishing, and anchoring on the reefs.

With passage of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, the Flower Garden Banks became a candidate for designation as a United States National Marine Sanctuary. The Houston Underwater Club led a movement to have the banks officially designated as sanctuaries by submitting a formal letter of nomination in 1979. President George H. W. Bush authorized Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary as the 10th National Marine Sanctuary on January 17, 1992. The sanctuary was enlarged to include Stetson Bank in 1996.

In June 2008, the marine sanctuary was assigned RV &quot;Manta&quot;, a research vessel in service with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to be its primary monitoring vessel and standby ship for emergency response.

===Expansion===

On January 19, 2021, NOAA issued the Final Instruction for expansion of Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary. This action protects 14 additional reefs and banks, slightly adjusts the boundaries of the sanctuary&#x27;s original three banks and expands the sanctuary from to a total of . The operative date of this action is March 22, 2021.

The final rule applies existing sanctuary regulations to all the new areas, supplying protection from the destructive impact of activities relevant to fishing with bottom-tending gear, ship anchoring, oil and gas exploration and production, and salvage activities on sensitive biological resources.

These areas include critical habitat for recreationally and commercially important fish, as well as threatened or endangered species of manta rays, sea turtles, and corals in the Gulf of Mexico.

==Biology==

Diving and sightseeing are popular activities in and near this sanctuary.

The three banks—East Flower Garden Bank, West Flower Garden Bank, and Stetson Bank—are underwater mountains. The banks support coral reefs, some of the healthiest in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic region. These reef communities began developing on the salt domes approximately 10,000–15,000 years ago. Today, they support a complex, balanced ecosystem of shallow and deep-water species.

Flower Garden Banks and areas near the sanctuary are one of only two places in the world where the golden phase of the smooth trunkfish can be found, the other being near the Bay Islands north of Honduras. The golden smooth trunkfish is not a distinct species but a different color variation of the smooth trunkfish that inhabits throughout the rest of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, including Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Scientists have not yet discovered the reason for the color differences in the Flower Garden Banks and Honduran populations.
Every August, about a week after the full moon, a mass coral spawning event takes place in and near the sanctuary. For some days, multiple species of star coral and brain corals release gametes into the water. This event allows for genetic mixing between different species of corals and increases diversification.

Manta rays, the largest species of ray in the ocean with a wingspans upwards of and weighing as much as , are a common sight in and near the sanctuary. Recent research confirmed that Flower Garden Banks serves as a critical nursery habitat for oceanic manta rays, offering young mantas protection from human activity. The sanctuary works toward the conservation of manta rays through expansion of the habitat.

The spotted eagle ray school in and around the sanctuary during the early part of the year. They have a pronounced head with a snout and distinct white spots and rings on their dark backs. They also have very long whip-like tails, longer than most other rays, with venomous spines used in defense when they are threatened. They can grow to have wingspans of nearly .

<text>Giovanna of Savoy (, &quot;Joanna Savoiska&quot;, ; 13 November 1907 – 26 February 2000) was an Italian princess of the House of Savoy who later became the Tsaritsa of Bulgaria by marriage to Boris III of Bulgaria.

==Early life==
Giovanna was born in Rome, the third daughter and the fourth of five children of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Queen Elena, former Princess of Montenegro. Upon her Roman Catholic christening, she was given the names Giovanna Elisabetta Antonia Romana Maria. Her older brother was the future (and last) Italian king Umberto II of Italy.

==Tsaritsa of Bulgaria==
Giovanna married Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria in the Basilica of St Francis of Assisi, Assisi on 25 October 1930, in a Roman Catholic ceremony, attended by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Bulgarians deemed her a good match, partly because her mother, Elena of Montenegro, was of Slavic ethnicity. At a second ceremony in Sofia, Giovanna (who herself was daughter of a Roman Catholic father and a formerly Orthodox mother) was married in an Eastern Orthodox Church ceremony, bringing her into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church. Giovanna adopted the Bulgarian version of her name, Ioanna. Giovanna knew the Pope&#x27;s Apostolic Visitor to Bulgaria, Archbishop Angelo Roncalli, the future Pope John XXIII, who was able to help her. She and Boris had two children: Marie Louise of Bulgaria, born on 13 January 1932, and Simeon II of Bulgaria, born on 16 June 1937.

In the years prior to World War II, Tsaritsa Ioanna became heavily involved in charities, including the financing of a children&#x27;s hospital. During the war she counterbalanced her husband consigning Bulgaria to the Axis by obtaining transit visas to enable a number of Jews to escape to Argentina. Tsar Boris also proved less malleable than Hitler had hoped, and following a meeting in Berlin in August 1943, the Tsar became seriously ill and died, aged 49. Stress and a heart condition were the official reasons for his death.

Ioanna&#x27;s son, Simeon, became the new tsar and a regency was established, led by his uncle Prince Kyril, who was considered more pliable by the Germans.

In the dying days of the Second World War, Bulgaria was occupied by the Soviet Union. Prince Kiril was tried by a People&#x27;s Court and subsequently executed. Ioanna and her son Simeon remained under house arrest at Vrana Palace, near Sofia, until 15 September 1946, when the new Communist government gave them 48 hours to leave the country because the state was declared republic after a referendum, although the queen wanted to leave Bulgaria after the execution of Prince Kiril on 1 February 1945.

==Late years==
After initially fleeing to Alexandria in the Kingdom of Egypt, to join her father, King Victor Emmanuel III, Giovanna and her son Simeon II moved on to Madrid. In 1962 Simeon II married and Queen Giovanna moved to Estoril, on the Portuguese Riviera, where she lived for the rest of her life, apart from a brief return to Bulgaria in 1993, when she visited the site of Boris&#x27;s grave and was present at the reburial of his heart.

She is buried in the Communal Cemetery of Assisi, Italy, where she had married King Boris III in 1930.

<text>In BDSM terms, a zipper is a string of clothespins or other clips, held together loosely by a cord or light chain.

The skin is clipped in the clips for a short time, then the cord is pulled, causing the clips to be pulled off the skin one by one in rapid sequence causing a unique sensation. Zippers come in many sizes and with varied numbers of clips. They are a very popular home-made BDSM toy.

<doc id="1256850" wikidata="Q808905" url="?curid=1256850" title="Barrhead, Alberta">
<text>Barrhead is a town in central Alberta, Canada that is surrounded by the County of Barrhead No. 11. It is located along the Paddle River and at the intersection of Highway 33 (Grizzly Trail) and Highway 18, approximately northwest of the City of Edmonton. It is also located along the route of the Express Trail, used by the North West Company, which was originally a First Nations trail. The trail was later widened by George Simpson and John Rowand to save the North West Company over $5,000.

The town was named after the Scottish town Barrhead, the birthplace of one of the children of the area&#x27;s early settlers, James McGuire. Barrhead&#x27;s official bird is the great blue heron.

== History ==
During the late 19th century and the early 20th century, Barrhead played an important role in the settlement of northwest Alberta. Highway 33, known as the Grizzly Trail, follows the original Klondike Trail, which was the shortest route to the Yukon during the Gold Rush years. Once established, this route was key to the settlement of the Peace River region. The old Barrhead town site, 3 km north of the present Town Centre, was a frequent stop over for the few Klondikers and others who needed supplies for the rigorous journey north.

Originally established in 1906, Barrhead&#x27;s position as a major trade centre on the historic Klondike Trail gave it a significant role in the settlement of north-western Alberta. It was a vital link in the trade route from Fort Edmonton to the Yukon. James McGuire, the child of one of the first settlers in the area, named Barrhead after his hometown in Scotland. Today, the community&#x27;s rich history can be revisited through a collection of artifacts at the Barrhead and District Museum. The museum also houses a large display of African taxidermy, as well as the Barrhead Visitor Information Centre, which is open from May to September. The great blue heron is another prominent figure in local lore, is often spotted along the shores of the Paddle River and local lakes, and is the town&#x27;s official animal. A statue of the bird is situated next to the Community Gazebo that marks the town centre and miniatures of the bird adorn the street posts.

The area was a quiet land of rolling hills well covered with stands of poplar, birch, pine and spruce trees on the higher ground with the low areas filled with willow and tamarack. The area has always been sparsely populated, with Cree natives passing through the region for the last 5000 years mainly settling around the different lakes in the region (such as Shoal Lake). In 1810 a First Nations trail was explored by David Thompson to connect the North Saskatchewan with Athabasca Pass, creating the first Canadian Transcontinental connection. In 1811 the first letter ever delivered from British Columbia to Montreal passed through this trail and its importance as a communication and trade route began to grow. In 1824, at the request of Gov. George Simpson the trail was widened from Fort Assiniboine to Fort Edmonton passing one mile (1.6 km) east of the present town, to accommodate the increased traffic along to route (as many as 75 horses or more a day). Some of the larger pack trains had over a hundred head of horses. The Cree natives and trappers moved across the area as they went about their business. As the First Nations peoples trapped a greater number of beavers and broke a number of dams the Klondike trial became flooded and partially abandoned until 1898. During the gold rush some Klondikers attempted to use the trail, although most preferred the drier route that was established heading up to Athabasca Landing. The pack-trail was widened to allow teams of horses and wagons, loaded high with provisions, to carry gold seekers north. Homesteaders soon followed. Surveys of the land took place in 1906 and 1907 and the pioneers applied for quarters (160 acres) of land. Trading posts were busy on both the Pembina and Athabasca rivers. A small store in the log home of Percy and Mary Johnstone (2 miles north and east of town) was in operation. Andy Tuttle lived to the south and helped many settlers as they arrived.

A post office named Paddle River was opened on Ted Speck&#x27;s farm, one mile (1.6 km) southeast of town on the south side of the river in 1907. A store in Josh Cason&#x27;s house, south and west of town, was operating in 1908 and a lean-to on the side provided a room for a school. Hugh Critchlow had taken land a mile north of Specks&#x27;, along the Klondike Trail in 1907. Soon the Speck brothers (Ted and Fred) had built a bridge across the river and a sawmill was in operation on the north side. Cason and Critchlow partnered to build a store at Critchlow&#x27;s in 1910 and the post office was moved there. A hall had been built just across the trail where school was held from 1909 to 1911. A blacksmith shop and a merry-go-round type swing completed the busy centre where nearly a hundred people attended the picnic in 1909. Rev. Seymour Dallas applied for a ten-acre cemetery plot (which is currently East Lawn Community Cemetery) and in 1913 the Anglican Church was built there. The church was subsequently moved to town in 1928 and then moved to Thunder Lake in 1967. 

The Paddle River Co-operative Society was formed in 1912 and opened a store in the old Johnstone building northeast of Barrhead in 1913. They immediately began construction on a new two-story building that would have room for community gatherings upstairs. Application was made for a post office, which required that they choose a name. The McGuire family suggested the name of their home town in Scotland and soon the Barrhead, Alberta, post office opened in the store on January 1, 1914.

The Finch family built a stopping house which still stands nearby. The North-West Mounted Police built a barracks and the hall was moved over from the southern location (2.5 miles). A blacksmith shop and a garage were built on the other corner of the intersection and various families bought lots and built homes. The bus service to Edmonton was started in 1926 and the Toronto Dominion/TD Canada Trust bank was opened in the stopping house. The children went to school at Glenreagh, two miles (3 km) west. The community applied to have the railway brought here from Busby and landowners hoped to sell right-of-way.

In 1907, Albert Shelton and family homesteaded the quarter that Barrhead&#x27;s main street is on. He built a house, barn, dug a well and did some fencing, mostly in the northeast corner of the quarter, the highest area of land. The Sheltons moved away in 1912 leaving the quarter vacant and by 1927 the land was cheap so the Northern Alberta Railways agreed to bring the Pembina Valley branch line to this quarter. The Barrhead people then scrambled to move their homes, the garage and the store to this new location, where four elevators were already being built. The pattern of the streets and lots were carefully laid in relation to the railway tracks and buildings went up in rapid succession. The pattern chosen for the lots is still used today. In no time at all, businesses were in operation; from grocery and hardware stores, a drug store, restaurant, hotel, real estate office, butcher shop, livery barn, etc. to another, which was the United Church. Ted Hooper supplied electric lights. The incorporation of the village took place in November 1927. A seven- or eight-bed hospital opened that fall on the corner of 49A Street and Railroad Avenue. A new hospital was built across the main road (Highway 33) in 1934.

The school was built and opened in 1928; a two-room building that needed another building for the High School by 1929. Around this time, heavy immigration started to occur from Germany. The town newspaper, the Barrhead News was printing in 1927 and soon was called the Barrhead Leader, the present day newspaper. In 1936, the curling rink was established plus William Johnson became the village constable. The movie theatre opened in 1939. In 1946, the village borrowed money to install water and sewer and that year on November 26 Barrhead became a town. Since then, the town has continued to grow and become continually more prosperous.

== Geography ==

The area contains dense stands of spruce, birch, pine and poplar. It also has some of the most fertile farmland in the province and is located between two major rivers, the Athabasca River and Pembina River.

If you go south and east of town there are low flatlands and river-lands, and to the west of town there is the area&#x27;s main recreational area, Thunder Lake Provincial Park, approximately west of the town. Thunder Lake is very popular for boating, fishing and camping and is home to many residents from other areas of the province during the summer months. The northern parts of the Barrhead region contain thick stands of spruce, pine and tamarack. Throughout the county of Barrhead there are also numerous lakes besides just Thunder Lake Provincial Park that are great for camping and fishing. There is also a local ski hill with good elevation on the Athabasca River valley.

<doc id="1256855" wikidata="Q950967" url="?curid=1256855" title="Gordon McQueen">
<text>Gordon McQueen (26 June 1952 – 15 June 2023) was a Scottish professional footballer who played as a centre-back for St Mirren, Leeds United and Manchester United, in addition to the Scotland national team.

McQueen started his footballing career at St Mirren in 1970, but in 1972 was bought by Leeds for £30,000 to replace Jack Charlton. He was a central figure during the 1973–74 campaign, during which the Leeds team were undefeated for the first 29 matches and won the title. McQueen scored three times during the club&#x27;s European Cup campaign the following season, but was suspended for the final, which Leeds lost. After a controversial move to Leeds&#x27; arch-rivals Manchester United, he won the 1983 FA Cup Final. McQueen joined Seiko in Hong Kong for one season in 1985, before retiring and moving into coaching; in that capacity, he managed Airdrieonians and St Mirren for periods in the 1980s.

McQueen played thirty times for Scotland, scoring five goals and winning the 1976–77 British Home Championship.

==Club career==
McQueen was a goalkeeper (the position in which his father Tom had played professionally) as a schoolboy but later switched to centre-back. He was signed at the age of 18 by St Mirren from Ayrshire Junior team Largs Thistle. He soon had scouts from other clubs monitoring his progress and it was Leeds United who finally offered £30,000 (£ today) in the 1972 close season, seeing him as a long-term replacement for the ageing Jack Charlton. Charlton played for some of the 1972–73 season but had decided to retire as the season was drawing to a close. McQueen played on six occasions in his first season at Leeds, including a substitute appearance in the 1973 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final, which Leeds lost to A.C. Milan.

With Charlton retired and Madeley playing in many positions, McQueen was in the team for most of the 1973–74 season. Leeds won the League Championship, with a run of 29 matches without a defeat from the start of the season with McQueen playing alongside Norman Hunter as Leeds&#x27; first-choice centre back pairing. Known for his heading, his stature and his stubborn attitude, McQueen played a significant role in the team&#x27;s success. McQueen and Hunter excelled at the back the following season, notably in Leeds&#x27; campaign in the European Cup, during which McQueen scored three goals. He was suspended for the 1975 European Cup Final after being sent off in the semi-final versus Barcelona. Leeds went on to lose 2–0 in the final versus Bayern Munich.

In February 1978, McQueen moved from Leeds to their arch-rivals Manchester United for £500,000 (£ today). On signing, he said that &quot;99% of players want to play for Manchester United and the rest are liars.&quot; He had declared only weeks earlier in &quot;Shoot&quot; magazine that he wanted to stay at Elland Road for his entire career. He played in the 1979 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, scoring United&#x27;s first of two goals in the 86th minute, but again finished on the losing side.

McQueen finally gained an FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal in the 1983 FA Cup final, which United won after a replay versus Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Earlier that season he was also in the team defeated by Liverpool in the League Cup final, in which he was used as a centre-forward because he was injured and United had already made their only permitted substitution. He left Old Trafford in the 1985 close season, having suffered from persistent knee injuries. After one season with Seiko in the Hong Kong First Division, he retired from playing.

==International career==
At the end of the 1973–74 season McQueen was called up to the Scotland squad and made his international debut versus Belgium. He was selected for the 1974 World Cup squad, but did not play. He soon became a regular for Scotland, and he captained the team and also scored his first international goal in a 1–1 draw against Romania on 1 June 1975. He achieved great success with Scotland in 1977, as he scored goals against Northern Ireland at Hampden then England at Wembley as the Scots won the British Home Championship and later that year he helped the team qualify for the 1978 World Cup by beating Wales at Anfield. Although he was selected for the 1978 World Cup squad, he could not play due to injury. McQueen played his last match for Scotland in 1981, having gained thirty caps and scored five goals.

==Post-playing career==
McQueen coached abroad before managing Airdrieonians from 1987 to 1989, before coaching at his first club St Mirren. When McQueen&#x27;s friend and former team-mate Bryan Robson was appointed the manager of Middlesbrough, McQueen joined him as reserve-team coach. He held this position for five years, and was then a first-team coach for two years. McQueen left the Teesside club in June 2001, following the departure of Robson and the appointment of Steve McClaren. McQueen then joined Sky Sports as a pundit, working on their &quot;Soccer Saturday&quot; results show.

On 29 April 2008, McQueen returned to Middlesbrough as assistant scout, alongside David Mills.

==Personal life==
After coaching Middlesbrough, McQueen and his wife lived in the village of Hutton Rudby, North Yorkshire. The couple had a son and two daughters, including Hayley, who is a sports journalist. Politically, McQueen was a Labour supporter.

In October 2011, McQueen was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer and started treatment at the James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough. In January 2021, he was diagnosed with vascular dementia. This highlighted the issue of injuries caused to footballers by persistent heading of a ball. He died from complications of dementia at home on 15 June 2023, at the age of 70.

<text>&quot;The Bonnie Earl o&#x27; Moray&quot; (Child 181, Roud 334) is a popular Scottish ballad, which may date from as early as the 17th century.

==Background==

The ballad touches on a true story stemming from the rivalry of James Stewart, Earl of Moray (pronounced Murray), and the Earl of Huntly (pronounced Huntly), which culminated in Huntly&#x27;s murder of Moray in 1592. The exact circumstances that led to the murder are not known for certain, but both their families, the Stewarts of Doune (pronounced &quot;doon&quot;) and the Gordons of Huntly, had a history of territorial rivalry and competition for royal favour. In his notes on the ballad, Francis James Child relates how Huntly, eager to prove that Moray was plotting with the Earl of Bothwell against King James VI, received a commission to bring Moray to trial. In the attempt to apprehend him, Moray&#x27;s house at Donibristle in Fife was set on fire and the visiting Sheriff of Moray killed. Moray fled the house, but was chased and killed in its grounds, betrayed, it was said, by the glow of his burning helmet tassle. His last words, according to the (probably apocryphal) story related by Walter Scott, deserve special mention. Huntly slashed him across the face with his sword, and as he lay dying Moray said &quot;Ye hae spilt a better face than yer ain&quot; (&quot;You have spoiled a better face than your own&quot;). The killing was widely condemned. Moray&#x27;s mother, Margaret Campbell, had a painting made of her son&#x27;s dead body, as evidence of his multiple wounds, bearing the legend &quot;God Revenge My Caus&quot;. Her intention was to show this publicly at the Cross in Edinburgh, but the King ignored her request.

==Lyrics and themes==

The King&#x27;s reaction in the ballad is to condemn Huntly&#x27;s action (in verse 2):

:&quot;Now wae be to thee, Huntly!
:And wherefore did you sae?
:I bade you bring him wi you,
:But forbade you him to slay.&quot;

Nevertheless, James did not punish Huntly, prompting rumours of his own complicity in the murder. It is possible that the inclusion of the King&#x27;s clear condemnation of the deed (whether or not it was ever expressed by him) was an effort to prevent the ballad from appearing treasonous. However, we can discount the ballad&#x27;s claim that Moray was the Queen&#x27;s lover (hinting at a possible motive for James&#x27;s complicity). The ballad, which praises Moray as &quot;a braw gallant&quot; (Scots, &quot;calland&quot;) , was most likely composed by one of his supporters. The words &quot;Oh he might have been a king!&quot; should not be taken to imply that he could have become King . More likely, they conveyed the sense that he possessed the required attributes of a king and so could easily have been one.

It is from the first verse of &quot;The Bonnie Earl o&#x27; Moray&quot; that the term mondegreen, meaning a misheard lyric, came into popular use among folk musicians.

:Ye Highlands and ye Lawlands,
:Oh where have you been?
:They have slain the Earl o&#x27; Moray
:And layd him on the green.

When the ballad is sung in Scots, the form is different from the more anglicised version in the Child catalogue. For example, the verses given above are sung with these words:

:Ye Hielands an ye Lowlands
:O, whaur hae ye been
:They hae slain the Earl o&#x27; Moray
:And lain him on the green.

:Now wae betide thee, Huntly
:And whaurfor did ye sae?
:I hae bade ye bring him wi ye
:But forbade ye him tae slay.

A German translation by Johann Gottfried Herder, &quot;Murrays Ermordung&quot;, published 1778–79, was set to music by Johannes Brahms in 1858. The ballad was also set to music by Hugh S. Roberton and Benjamin Britten.

==Mondegreen==
The American writer Sylvia Wright coined the term &quot;mondegreen&quot; in an essay &quot;The Death of Lady Mondegreen&quot;, which was published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in November 1954. In the essay, Wright described how, as a young girl, she misheard the final two lines of the above verse as &quot;they have slain the Earl o&#x27; Moray, and Lady Mondegreen.&quot; She said that she always imagined the Earl dying beside his faithful lover &quot;Lady Mondegreen&quot;, and refused to hear the real words, because they were less romantic than her misheard version. The term &quot;mondegreen&quot; has since been adopted for any misheard song lyric which changes the meaning of the original.

==Recordings==
Versions of the ballad can be heard on Isla St Clair&#x27;s album &quot;Great Songs and Ballads of Scotland&quot; and Irish-American singer Robbie O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s album &quot;Close to the Bone&quot;. It was also recorded by Robin Hall and Jimmie Macgregor for the album &quot;Scottish Choice&quot; (1961). Live version recorded by The Corries on their album &quot;Live from Scotland Volume 4&quot; (1977).

English composer Benjamin Britten arranged the song for voice and piano sometime before 11 December 1940, and included it in the first volume of his folk song arrangements.

<text>Michael Barry Murphy (born January 25, 1958) is a New Brunswick lawyer and politician.

== Biography ==
Murphy graduated from Moncton High School in 1976, from the University of New Brunswick with a Bachelor of Business Administration in 1980 and a Bachelor of Laws in 1983. He received his Master of Laws from Osgoode Hall Law School in 2002.

A personal injury lawyer, Murphy was president of the New Brunswick Liberal Association from 1988 to 1993.

In 2001, Murphy considered running for the leadership of the New Brunswick Liberal Party, but dropped out after forming an early campaign team. He supported Shawn Graham, the eventual winner.

He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in the 2003 election, the only Liberal to win a seat in Moncton. Following the election, he was named as opposition critic for the Department of Family and Community Services, a post he held until being elevated to finance critic in early 2005.

He was re-elected in the 2006 election and joined the cabinet as Minister of Health.

In June 2009, Murphy became the Attorney General and Justice Minister. He resigned from cabinet in January 2010 to spend more time with his family and return to practising law. At the time, Murphy said the decision had nothing to do with the government, but later admitted that he did quit over NB Power, but said he felt it was more honourable to not say so at the time. In early 2010, Murphy took a partner position at the law firm of Cox and Palmer in Moncton. In 2011 he formed his own firm which has expanded to over 20 employees. In 2022, it was re-branded as the Mike Murphy Law Group, and expanded into Halifax, Nova Scotia, where his son, Aodhan Murphy, resides

=== New Brunswick Liberal Association leadership election, 2012 ===
On January 5, 2012, Murphy announced he was entering the race for the leadership of the New Brunswick Liberal Party. In October 2012, at the leadership convention, Murphy was defeated on the first ballot by Brian Gallant.

<text>The Non-Partisan Solidarity Union is a political party in Taiwan. It was established on 16 June 2004, led by founding Chairwoman Chang Po-ya and emerged a major player in the national political scene during the 2004 Legislative Yuan election, with 26 candidates running for local constituency and aboriginal seats, and 6 others nominated for proportional representation seats.

==History==
At its founding, it was something of a big tent party in that it lacked a central ideology and fielded various candidates who ran more on their personal qualities rather than a well-articulated commonality.

The party won six seats in the 6th Legislative Yuan (2005–2008), three seats in the 7th Legislative Yuan (2008–2012), two seats in the 2012 election and one in the 2016 election.

<text>The Halaib Triangle is an area of land measuring located on the Northeast African coast of the Red Sea. The area, which takes its name from the town of Halaib, is created by the difference in the Egypt–Sudan border between the &quot;political boundary&quot; set in 1899 by the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium, which runs along the 22nd parallel north, and the &quot;administrative boundary&quot; set by the British in 1902, which gave administrative responsibility for an area of land north of the line to Sudan, which was an Anglo-Egyptian client at the time. With the independence of Sudan in 1956, both Egypt and Sudan claimed sovereignty over the area. The area has been considered to be a part of the Sudan&#x27;s Red Sea State, and was included in local elections until the late 1980s. In 1994, the Egyptian military moved to take control of the area as a part of Red Sea Governorate, and Egypt has been actively investing in it since then. Egypt has been recently categorical in rejecting international arbitration or even political negotiations regarding the area.

The description of the area as a &quot;triangle&quot; is a rough approximation. The southern boundary follows latitude 22°, the northeastern consists of the Red Sea coast, and the northwestern is jagged. A smaller area south of latitude 22°, referred to as Bir Tawil, joins the Halaib Triangle at its westernmost point along the latitude lineneither Sudan nor Egypt claims Bir Tawil.

Beja, Arabic and English are spoken there.

=== Colonial origins ===

On 19 January 1899, an agreement between the UK and Egypt relating to the administration of the Sudan defined &quot;Soudan&quot; as the &quot;territories south of the 22nd parallel of latitude&quot;. It contained a provision that would give Egypt control of the Red Sea port of Suakin, but an amendment on 10 July 1899 gave Suakin to Sudan instead. On 4 November 1902, the UK drew a separate &quot;administrative boundary&quot;, intended to reflect the actual use of the land by the tribes in the region.

The 1902 border assigned administration of the territory of the Ababda tribe south of the 22-degree latitude line to Egypt, and gave to Sudan the grazing land of the Beja tribe north of the line to administer. The Sudan-administered territory comprised about 18,000 km2 (7000 sq. mi.), including the towns of Halaib and Abu Ramad. When Sudan became independent in 1956, Egypt regarded the latitude 22° territorial boundary of 1899 as the border between the two countries, while Sudan held to the claimed 1902 administrative boundary. As a result, both Egypt and Sudan claim sovereignty over the territory. Conversely, the area south of the line which had been administered by Egypt, Bir Tawil, is a &quot;terra nullius&quot;, claimed by neither country.

=== 20th century ===
In February 1958, two years after Sudanese independence, with Sudan planning to hold elections in the Triangle, President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt sent troops into the disputed region for the referendum of the proposed unification between Egypt and Syria in the United Arab Republic, but withdrew them the same month. Halaib was considered part of Sudan&#x27;s Red Sea State and participated in all Sudanese elections until the last Sudanese election in the late 1980s.

Although both countries continued to lay claim to the land, joint control of the area remained in effect until 1992, when Egypt objected to Sudan&#x27;s granting of exploration rights for the waters off the Triangle to a Canadian oil company. Negotiations began, but the company pulled out of the deal until sovereignty was settled. In July 1994, Sudan sent memoranda to the United Nations Security Council, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Arab League complaining about what it claimed was more than 39 military and administrative incursions by Egypt into Sudanese territory since Sudan had last filed memoranda in May 1993. In January 1995, Egypt rejected a Sudanese request for the OAU Foreign Ministers&#x27; Council to review the dispute at their meeting in Addis Ababa. Then, after an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak when he arrived in Addis Ababa to attend the meeting, Egypt accused Sudan of complicity, and, among other responses, strengthened its control of the Halaib Triangle, expelling Sudanese police and other officials.

In 1998, relations between Egypt and Sudan somewhat improved, and the countries announced their intention to work together to resolve the Halaib Triangle dispute, with increased cooperation between their security forces. Later that year, though, Sudan accused Egypt of harassing Sudanese citizens in the area, a charge which Egypt denied. Nevertheless, by March 1999, the countries were in diplomatic discussions aimed at improving relations between them. During a visit to Egypt by Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in December 1999, a joint communique was issued pledging to solve the Halaib dispute &quot;in an integrational brotherly context...&quot;

In January 2000, Sudan withdrew its forces from the area, effectively ceding control of the border zone to Egypt, whose forces have occupied and administered the area since.

===21st century===
In 2004, Sudanese president Omar Al-Bashir claimed that despite his nation&#x27;s withdrawal in 2000, and Egypt&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; control of the Triangle, the area still rightfully belonged to Sudan, which had &quot;never relinquished&quot; it. &quot;We did not make any concessions... The proof is that we have recently renewed the complaint to the Security Council,&quot; he said, according to the Press. Al-Bashir reiterated the Sudanese claim of sovereignty over Halaib in a 2010 speech in Port Sudan, saying &quot;Halayeb is Sudanese and will always be Sudanese.&quot;

The Eastern Front, a Sudanese politico-military coalition comprising the Beja Congress and Free Lions that signed a peace agreement with Khartoum, has stated that it considers Halaib to be part of Sudan due to its population being ethnically, linguistically and tribally connected to that country. The head of the Eastern Front and Beja Congress, Musa Muhammad Ahmad, has declared that the issue of Halaib&#x27;s sovereignty should be decided by international arbitration in a similar manner to the issue of sovereignty over Abyei between Northern and Southern Sudan.

In October 2009, the Electoral Commission that prepared a comprehensive plan for Sudan&#x27;s general elections in April 2010 declared that Halaib was one of the Red Sea State electoral districts and that its people should exercise their constitutional rights and register in order to participate in the general elections. Voter registration did not take place in the Halaib Triangle area because the team from the Sudanese election commission was refused entry by Egyptian authorities. In December 2009, the Sudanese presidential assistant Musa Mohamed Ahmed was barred from entering the border area. Ahmed&#x27;s visit was intended to &quot;assert [Sudanese] sovereignty over the Halaib Triangle and inspect the situation of the people and provide moral and financial support to the members of the Sudanese army unit trapped inside since the [Egyptian] occupation began.&quot; His remarks were the first official recognition that Sudanese Army personnel remained inside the area of &quot;de facto&quot; Egyptian control. Ahmed also asserted that the Halaib Triangle is Sudanese and would not be forsaken &quot;under any circumstances.&quot;

The government of Egypt is taking steps to close the Egyptian-Sudanese trade center of Alshalateen and move it to the border control pass point on the 22nd parallel, which has had its facilities enlarged and its administrative manpower increased to handle the Egyptian-Sudanese land trade. By doing this, trucks bringing goods to Egypt from Sudan will not be allowed to unload their goods in Alshalateen, as in the past, but instead at the Hadarba border pass point. Wadi Halfa is another border pass point west of the Nile River at 22 degrees north.

In 2009, the Egyptian electricity authority was building a line to supply the city of Alshalateen with electric power from the main Egyptian grid to replace the generators being used there. This line will extend in the future to Abu Ramad and Halaib. Since May 2010 a new paved road has connected the triangle to Port Sudan.

It was reported in the Sudanese daily &quot;Al-Ahram Today&quot; on 22 April 2010 that Al-Taher Muhammad Hasaay, the former head of the Halaib Council and a member of the Bisharin tribe who was campaigning against the Egyptian military presence in the Halaib Triangle, died in a hospital in Cairo after having been detained by Egyptian security forces without trial for two years. A delegation of the Bisharin tribe stated to the Sudan Media Centre that seven of their members were also in detention: Muhammad Eissa Saeed, who had been in custody for six years, Ali Eissa Abu Eissa and Muhammad Saleem, detained for five years, and Hashim Othman, Muhammad Hussein AbdalHakam, Karrar Muhammad Tahir and Muhammad Tahir Muhammad Saleh each in holding for two years.

In July 2010, it was reported in the Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Masry Al-Youm&quot; that the chiefs of three tribes in the Halaib Triangle – Ababda, el-Basharya and Beja – supported the Egyptian claims for the area, stating that they are Egyptian and not Sudanese citizens, and that they have all the rights of Egyptian citizens, including national identity cards, the right to vote in elections and to serve in the Egyptian military.

On November 29, 2010, an open letter was sent to the President of Sudan by Muhammad Al-Hassan Okair (Honda) who had been the parliamentary member of Halaib in 1995, from Halaib itself. The letter was written on behalf of the Bisharin, Hamad-Orab and Aliyaab tribes and complained of the forced inclusion of 20 villages that had been administered under indigenous civil society structures into two Egyptian electoral districts. The letter further complained of the siege of Halaib, the fact that its inhabitants live within barbed wire and that anything from Sudan is refused entry on the premise that Halaib is Egyptian and that the tribes&#x27; camels are not allowed to travel and graze for pasture in the ancestral lands of the Bisharin from Halaib to the neighbouring state of River Nile in Sudan.

The Egyptian government converted the village of Halayeb to a city, and various civilian projects are under construction. Mamdouh Ali Omara was elected by the local inhabitants as representative for the Halayeb area in the Egyptian parliamentary election of November 2015.

In 2016, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a brief statement that these are Egyptian territories subject to Egyptian sovereignty, and that Egypt had no additional comment to make. International arbitration requires the consent of the concerned parties, whereas Egypt has been refusing arbitration to date.

A new asphalt-paved road has been built which begins south-west of Alshalateen and goes through the western portion of the triangle to the border pass of Suhin (Sohin), which is located at the 22nd parallel. In the future, this road will connect to the city of Abu Hamad in Sudan. Parts of the road can be seen on Google Earth and Bing maps.

==Settlements==
The town of Halaib lies on the Red Sea coast. The major town in the area is Abu Ramad which lies north west of Halaib on the coast. Abu Ramad is the last destination of the buses that connect the area to Cairo and the other cities of Egypt such as Aswan, Marsa Alam and Qena. The only other populated place is the small village of Hadarba, south east of Halaib town on the coast. Alshalateen is an Egyptian town just on the northern administrative boundary. The closest Sudanese town south of the disputed area is Osief (Marsa Osief), located south of latitude 22, the political border line claimed by Egypt based on the 1899 agreement.

==Ecology and geography==
In the Halaib region, Afrotropical elements have their northern limits at Gebel Elba, making it a unique region among Egypt&#x27;s dominating Mediterranean and North African ecosystems. There is also dense cover of acacias, mangroves and other shrubs, in addition to endemic species of plants such as &quot;Biscutella elbensis&quot;.

The highest peaks in the area are Mount Elba (), Mount Shellal (), Mount Shendib () and Mount Shendodai (). The mountainous area of Gebel Elba is a nature reserve declared by Egypt in a decree signed by the former prime minister Ahmed Nazif.

<text>Alverno College is a private Roman Catholic women&#x27;s college in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

==History==
Chartered in 1887 as St. Joseph&#x27;s Normal School, Alverno became Alverno Teachers College in 1936. It adopted its current name in 1946.

Milwaukee native Christy L. Brown was selected as the college&#x27;s ninth president on April 19, 2023. The following year, the college had a $12.4 million operating deficit. Its board of trustees subsequently declared &quot;financial exigency&quot; and announced plans to eliminate full-time faculty and staff, cut academic programs, end its track and field program, and engage in other activities to address the deficit.

==Academics==
Alverno offers undergraduate programs and a coeducational Master of Arts program for teachers and business professionals, the Alverno MBA, and a Master of Science in nursing. The Weekend College was opened in 1977 as the first alternative time-frame program in Milwaukee to serve working women in the Milwaukee area. It is still primarily a women&#x27;s college. The baccalaureate degree programs, residences, etc. are still open only to women; graduate degree programs are open to both women and men.

Alverno does not use a letter or number system for grading, but instead uses an abilities based curriculum and narrative evaluation.

=== Rankings ===
Alverno College was tied for 62 out of 127 in Regional Universities Midwest in the 2022-23 U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Colleges ranking.

== Athletics ==
Alverno College teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III. The Inferno are a member of the Northern Athletics Conference (NAC). Alverno was also a member of the Lake Michigan Conference until the spring of 2006. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball. Boxing was added as a club sport in 2016, and the team competes as part of the United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association; they have earned one individual championship as of 2019.

<text>Thomas Vincent Savini (born November 3, 1946) is an American prosthetic makeup artist, actor, stunt performer and film director. He is known for his makeup and special effects work on many films directed by George A. Romero, including &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Creepshow&quot;, and &quot;Monkey Shines&quot;; he also created the special effects and makeup for many cult classics like &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (parts I and IV), &quot;Maniac&quot;, &quot;The Burning&quot;, &quot;The Prowler&quot;, and &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;.

Savini directed &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, the 1990 remake of Romero&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;; his other directing work includes three episodes of the TV show &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; and one segment in &quot;The Theatre Bizarre&quot;. As an actor and stuntman, he has appeared in films such as &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Knightriders&quot;, &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;, &quot;Planet Terror&quot;, &quot;Machete&quot;, &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, and &quot;Machete Kills&quot;.

==Early life==
Savini was born on November 3, 1946, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is of Italian descent. He was raised Catholic and graduated from Central Catholic High School. As a boy, his inspiration was actor Lon Chaney: Savini attributes his earliest desires to create makeup effects to Chaney and the film &quot;Man of a Thousand Faces&quot;. 

Experimenting with whatever medium he could find, the young Savini practiced creating makeup effects on himself, later convincing his friends to let him practice his craft on them. He also discovered another passion: acting. Combining his makeup applications and homemade costumes, he especially enjoyed scaring his friends. 

Among the many talents Savini nurtured as a young man were fencing and gymnastics. He is also accomplished with a bullwhip and can do motorcycle stunts. Many of his characters would be bikers or madmen who are hardened and eerily evil.

Savini attended Point Park University for three years before enlisting in the United States Army.

Savini served as a combat photographer during the Vietnam War. In a 2002 interview, he told the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,&quot; &quot;When I was in Vietnam, I was a combat photographer. My job was to shoot images of damage to machines and to people. Through my lens, I saw some hideous [stuff]. To cope with it, I guess I tried to think of it as special effects. Now, as an artist, I just think of creating the effect within the limitations we have to deal with.&quot; He continued to practice with makeup in Vietnam, often frightening indigenous peasants by appearing to suddenly transform into a &quot;monster&quot;.

Using the lens of his camera, Savini separated himself from the real-life horrors of war, although the images still haunted his mind. Savini said his wartime experiences influenced his eventual style of gory effects: &quot;I hated that when I watched a war movie and someone dies. Some people die with one eye open and one eye half-closed, sometimes people die with smiles on their faces because the jaw is always slack. I incorporated the feeling of the stuff I saw in Vietnam into my work.&quot; 

In 1969, while on guard duty on Cantho Airfield, a flare was triggered in the jungle area Savini was watching. Against military protocol, Savini fired into the bush without informing his superiors. Other soldiers likewise began firing until a duck wandered from the bush completely unharmed. Due to his failure to follow orders, Savini was taken off guard duty from his bunker on the following evening. That same evening, the bunker came under attack and several soldiers were wounded or killed. As a result of this incident, Savini earned the nickname &quot;Duck Slayer&quot; and to this day will not eat duck.

After his tour in Vietnam, he attended Carnegie-Mellon University, as the first undergraduate to be awarded a full fellowship in the acting and directing program. He appeared in stage productions throughout college and continued on stage long after his tour of duty in Vietnam.

==Career==
Savini is primarily known for his groundbreaking work in the special make-up effects known as prosthetic makeup. His signature style and techniques bring vivid realism to genre films. 

Early in Savini&#x27;s career, Dick Smith—known for his groundbreaking work in &quot;The Exorcist—&quot;became an inspiration and a guide, and later an associate at Savini&#x27;s Special Make-up Effects Program.

Savini got his breakthrough working with Pittsburgh filmmaker George A. Romero, providing a convincing wrist-slashing effect in the opening scenes of &quot;Martin&quot; (1978). The following year, working with a larger budget on &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, Savini created his signature palette of severed limbs and bite-marks. In the 1980 slasher film &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;, Savini expanded his repertoire of blood and gore. He continued to perfect those techniques in 1980&#x27;s &quot;Maniac&quot;. and 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Burning&quot; and &quot;The Prowler.&quot; 

Savini earned the nickname &quot;The Sultan of Splatter&quot;. In 1982, he created more traditional horror effects in &quot;Creepshow&quot;, a movie directed by Romero from a script written by Stephen King. In 1984, he agreed to work on &quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot;, where he killed his creation Jason Voorhees. Returning to the zombie genre in 1985, Savini won the year&#x27;s Saturn Award for Best Makeup Effects for his work on the Romero&#x27;s &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;. In 1986, Savini worked with director Tobe Hooper on the film &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;. 

Savini has also worked on films by Italian director Dario Argento: 1990&#x27;s &quot;Two Evil Eyes&quot; and 1993&#x27;s &quot;Trauma&quot;. In the 1991 film &quot;Heartstopper&quot;, he created special effects for director John A. Russo. In 2011, he supervised the effects for the Australian film &quot;Redd Inc&quot;.

Savini has also acted in many of the same films he created effects for. His first appearance was a relatively straight, innocuous character in &quot;Martin&quot; in 1978. He then played Blades, a menacing biker, in &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, a role he reprised in zombie form with a cameo appearance in the 2005 continuation of the series, &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;. In &quot;Maniac&quot;, he briefly appeared before facing the maniac&#x27;s shotgun and having his head blown off in a spectacular display. Savini had a more prominent role as biker and antagonist Morgan, the Black Knight, in Romero&#x27;s &quot;Knightriders&quot; (1981). Savini played the whip-wielding, vampire-fighting biker &quot;Sex Machine&quot; in the 1996 Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez film &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;.

In 2007, Savini had a role in &quot;Planet Terror&quot;, one of two stories in the &quot;Grindhouse&quot; film, directed by Robert Rodriguez. Savini plays Deputy Tolo, who fights to save his town from an infestation of zombie-like creatures. In another Rodriguez film, &quot;Machete&quot;, based on a fake movie trailer played during the film &quot;Grindhouse&quot;, Savini played Osiris Amanpour, hired to track and kill the protagonist Machete. Savini reprised his role in the sequel &quot;Machete Kills&quot;. 

Cameos include roles as the vampire David Van Etten in &quot;Lost Boys: The Tribe;&quot; as the sheriff in the 2004 &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; remake; and the tongue-in-cheek Jesus Christ in &quot;Zombiegeddon&quot; (2003). 

In 2006, Savini essayed the role of Prester John, the mythical villain in the dreamlike &quot;Sea of Dust&quot;. That year also saw the release of Johannes Roberts&#x27; &quot;Forest of the Damned&quot;, in which Savini played a mad hermit surrounded by angels cast from heaven. In 2008, he made a brief appearance in &quot;Zack &amp; Miri Make a Porno&quot; as a thieving slumlord. He also appeared in &quot;The Dead Matter&quot;, along with Andrew Divoff and Jim O&#x27;Rear. Savini voiced himself on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Worst Episode Ever&quot;: While making an appearance at Android&#x27;s Dungeon, Savini performs the &quot;Gutbuster&quot; gag, covering the crowd in &quot;blood and guts&quot; and consequently humiliating the Comic Book Guy. In 2012, Savini appeared as a shop teacher, Mr. Callahan, in the Pittsburgh-set teen drama &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot;, starring Logan Lerman. Savini also appeared as one of the Trackers in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Django Unchained&quot;. Future projects include Savini starring in the Nazi zombie film &quot;The 4th Reich&quot; directed by Shaun Robert Smith, playing the role of SS-Standartenführer Oskar Dirlewanger. 

As a film director, Savini helmed episodes of the syndicated television series &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;, the 1990 color remake of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;; and &quot;Housecall&quot;, the pilot of the proposed series &quot;The Chill Factor&quot;, which starred Pittsburgh actor Bingo O&#x27;Malley. In 2011, he directed &quot;Wet Dreams&quot;, one of six segments to the horror film &quot;The Theatre Bizarre&quot;. In 2009, Savini announced his plan to direct a new film, &quot;Death Island&quot;, with special make-up effects by his former protege Greg Nicotero. On September 1, 2013, Savini began a crowdfunding project on Indiegogo for &quot;Death Island&quot;. His plans were to begin filming by the end of 2013.

In the 2008 novel &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; by Jonathan Maberry, Savini appears as one of the real-world horror celebrities who are in the fictional town of Pine Deep when monsters attack; other celebrities include James Gunn, Jim O&#x27;Rear, Brinke Stevens, Ken Foree, Stephen Susco, Debbie Rochon, Joe Bob Briggs and blues man Mem Shannon.

Savini also briefly took part in Jerry Lawler&#x27;s 2010 revival of the &quot;Memphis Wrestling&quot; pro wrestling television show. His on-screen character sent horror-movie monsters (played by wrestlers from the Memphis area) onto the show to get revenge for Savini who blamed Lawler for the death of Savini&#x27;s friend Andy Kaufman; the monsters&#x27; handler was manager &quot;Hollywood&quot; Jimmy Blaylock.

In 2012, American filmmaker Jason Baker published a biography of Savini entitled &quot;Smoke and Mirrors: The Story of Tom Savini&quot;.

He said during a Q&amp;A with fans that the hardest movie he has ever worked on was &quot;Creepshow&quot; because it was &quot;five movies in one&quot;.

In 2018, Savini announced via his Instagram that he would be directing a horror web series, in collaboration with others, including Tina Romero, Romero&#x27;s daughter. Special effects for the web series were to be completed by Savini&#x27;s students at Douglas Education Center.

In May 2019, Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor said in an interview that Savini worked to produce and create his new masks for the upcoming &quot;We Are Not Your Kind&quot; album and subsequent tour cycles. Around the same time, Savini was approached by wrestler Bray Wyatt to design the mask for his new &quot;Fiend&quot; character.

==FX education==

Savini runs the Tom Savini&#x27;s Special Make-Up Effects Program at the Douglas Education Center in Monessen, Pennsylvania. Savini says he refers offers he receives for movie make-up effects projects to his students and graduates of his school. 

Savini is the author of several books on special effects, including &quot;Grande Illusions&quot; I and II (1983, 1994), which detail the production and mechanical workings of many of his famous film effects. In &quot;Horror F/X&quot;, a 1989 direct-to-video interview conducted by frequent collaborator Russo, Savini explains many of his effects techniques, illustrated by film clips and behind-the-scenes video footage. He is also associated with other books in the horror genre including &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Horror 101&quot; for which he wrote the foreword. Savini has also appeared in public demonstrating his effects, including appearances in the 1980s on &quot;Late Night With David Letterman&quot; in which he demonstrated such effects as &quot;fire gel&quot; and a gunshot to the head on Letterman himself.

<text>Exercise Zapad-81 () was the largest military exercise ever to be carried out by the Soviet Union, according to NATO and US sources. It was conducted from 4 September 1981 and lasted approximately eight days, it involved between 100,000 and 150,000 troops. It was a joint operation including elements from all Soviet service branches and introduced several new systems such as the RSD-10 medium-range strategic missile (known often to the West as the SS-20 Saber) and the Project 1143 aircraft carrier &quot;Kiev&quot;.

==History==
The exercise was first and foremost a show of force. Propaganda tapes were made of the large scale offensives concluding in a large victory parade. Apart from being a show of force to the NATO countries, the exercise was a large-scale demonstration of military capability in Poland. After failed reforms, communism in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland during the seventies was in a state of crisis and civil unrest (Solidarność). Exercise Zapad included amphibious landings in Poland near Gdańsk, reminding Poles that the Soviet Union could resort to military force if it was deemed necessary for the preservation of communist power.

The exercise was criticised by the US for violating the Helsinki Final Act of notification of military exercises.

<doc id="1256923" wikidata="Q7622250" url="?curid=1256923" title="Stratovision">
<text>Stratovision was an airborne television transmission relay system using aircraft flying at high altitudes. In 1945 the Glenn L. Martin Company and Westinghouse Electric Corporation originally proposed television coverage of small towns and rural areas, as well as the large metropolitan centers, by fourteen aircraft that would provide coverage for approximately 78% of the people in the United States. Although this was never implemented, the system has been used for domestic broadcasting in the United States, and by the U.S. military in South Vietnam and other countries.

==Technology==
Because the broadcasting antenna for Stratovision is usually hung beneath the aircraft in flight, it naturally has a great command of line-of-sight propagation. Although transmission distances are dependent upon atmospheric conditions, a transmitting antenna above the Earth&#x27;s surface has a line of sight distance of approximately .

A Stratovision 25 kW transmitter operating from at 600 MHz will achieve a field intensity of 2 millivolts per meter for a high receiving antenna up to away from the aircraft.

==Early tests==
Stratovision tests were undertaken between June 1948 to February 1949. The first phase was undertaken by the Glenn L. Martin Co. and Westinghouse using a twin-engine PV-2 aircraft flying at that transmitted with 250 watts on 107.5 MHz and 5 kW on 514 MHz at Baltimore, Maryland so that recordings could be made at various locations ranging from Norfolk, Virginia to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Boston, Massachusetts.

The second phase of testing was undertaken by these companies using a stripped-down B-29 Superfortress flying at . The plane was equipped to receive a relay transmission from WMAR-TV in Baltimore, which was then relayed over a 5 kW video transmitter and a 1 kW audio transmitter for reception on 82-88 MHz with a television set tuned to Channel 6.

The aircraft received its originating signals from circular dipoles attached to a streamlined eight-foot (2.5 m) mast atop of the aircraft&#x27;s vertical tail fin. The retractable long broadcasting antenna hung vertically beneath the aircraft. It was composed of a two-element turnstile array for video and a single-element circular dipole for sound transmissions.

The receivers, transmitters and necessary air-conditioning were all powered by the plane&#x27;s engines using three 15 kVA, 500 Hz alternators. Without air conditioning the transmitters in the interior of the aircraft would have generated a temperature of 134 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius) with an outside air temperature of 25 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 4 degrees Celsius).

On 23 June 1948 the system&#x27;s airborne transmitter rebroadcast the Republican National Convention, being held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to the surrounding nine-state area during the 9 to 10 pm EDT time period. As part of the activity, a receiver was set up in a hall in Zanesville, Ohio, a small city on the outskirts of the broadcast area, to demonstrate to invited newspaper reporters that the system was capable of reaching &quot;small town and farm homes&quot;.

The tests were watched by many television viewers who sent in reception reports. From these reports it was calculated that Stratovision would require only eight relay planes to provide a transcontinental network, and six additional planes to provide coverage to 78% of the United States. Charles Edward Nobles, the head of Stratovision for Westinghouse, said in his report:
:&quot;The major technical problems of the system have been solved, and the commercial development awaits only the crystallization of public demand for the expanded services offered by airborne broadcasting, application of the system by the radio industry to meet this demand, and the clarification of channel facilities available to make possible this application.&quot;

==Sports==
On September 30, 1954, Cuba used a DC-3 to broadcast a baseball championship game from the United States, the first live extracontinental broadcast.

==Education==
In 1961 a nonprofit organization, Midwest Program on Airborne Television Instruction, commenced a Stratovision service from the airfield of Purdue University. The effort began as a three-year experiment funded by the Ford Foundation. The program organized, produced and transmitted educational television programs four days a week from a DC-6AB aircraft flying at over the community of Montpelier in north central Indiana.

MPATI delivered its programs to television channels 72 (call sign KS2XGA) and 76 (KS2XGD) in the UHF band, by transmitting videotaped lectures from the aircraft to an estimated potential 5,000,000 students in 13,000 schools and colleges. The aircraft were equipped with two videotape machines and two UHF transmitters.

When MPATI signed on it used an &quot;Indian head&quot; test pattern card which was shown for five minutes before and between programs. The service ended in 1968 when it became embroiled in legal action over their application of Stratovision in a controversy with the Westinghouse company.

==Propaganda==
===Vietnam War===
During the Vietnam War, the United States Navy used Stratovision television technology when it flew &quot;Operation Blue Eagle&quot; from 1966 to 1972 over the Saigon area of South Vietnam. The television programs were aimed at two audiences on two channels: one was aimed at the general public and the other was intended for the information and entertainment of US troops who were stationed in South Vietnam.

On January 3, 1966, a &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine article, &quot;Vietnam to get airborne TV: Two-channel service —one for Vietnamese, other for U.S. servicemen—starts this month&quot;, noted:
&quot;Television broadcasting in South Vietnam ... begins January 21 and it&#x27;s going to be done from the air. Two airplanes, circling above the ground, will broadcast on two TV channels—one transmitting Saigon government programs; the other U.S. programs. The project is being handled by the U.S. Navy. Also involved are the U.S. Information Agency and the Agency for International Development. Work on modifying two Lockheed Super Constellations has been underway by Navy electronics experts at Andrews Air Force Base ... The project is an outgrowth of a broadcasting plane used by the Navy during the Cuban and Dominican Republic crises when both radio and television were beamed to home in those countries.&quot;

The same article went on to report that during the Baseball World Series of October 1965 Stratovision had also been used to bring the games to the troops. The aircraft had picked up Voice of America radio broadcasts from California and relayed the signal to a ground broadcasting station. The Agency for International Development (AID) had purchased through the military Post Exchange Service, 1,000 monochrome, 23-inch television sets modified to operate on a variety of domestic power sources, and which had been airlifted to South Vietnam on December 28, 1965. They were to be put into community facilities around Saigon. AID was also spending $2.4 million to supply a total of 2,500 TV sets to South Vietnam.

The entire project was under the control of Captain George C. Dixon, USN. He claimed to be installing AM, FM, shortwave and TV transmitters on the aircraft which would get their power from an onboard 100 kW diesel-fueled generator. The planes would not only relay programs from film chain kinescopes and video recorders, but they would also have live cameras to create their own live programs.

Ground transmissions would be received from the aircraft on TV sets tuned to channel 11 for Armed Forces Television, and channel 9 for programs in Vietnamese. On radio the broadcasts would be tuned to 1000 kHz for AM and 99.9 MHz for FM.

On 7 February 1966, &quot;Broadcasting&quot; magazine reported that after working out a number of technical problems that the first show on channel 9 would begin at 7:30 p.m. and feature South Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky and U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge in a videotaped production, followed by channel 11 at 8 p.m. with General Westmoreland introducing a two-hour program which incorporated one hour of the Grand Ole Opry filmed in Nashville, Tennessee. After that the Vietnamese channel would be seen for one and half hours a day and the U.S. channel for three hours daily.

On 8 February 1966 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article &quot;South Vietnamese Watch First TV Show&quot; reported that South Vietnamese viewers had to strain their ears because the speakers on the TV sets would need to be amplified if they were going to be heard by a room full of people watching THVN-TV channel 9. The U.S. programming on NWB-TV channel 11 was Bob Hope in a two-hour special called &quot;Hollywood Salute to Vietnam&quot;, followed by half-an-hour of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; and another half-hour of the quiz show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;. The regular line-up of shows included &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

===1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia===
EC-130 Commando Solo was used in propaganda warfare during the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with questionable success. Production was very cheap, below local TV standards in Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with slide show and narration based news. Quality of reception was very poor and area of coverage was rather small.

===Iraq War===
During the 2000s, the EC-130 Commando Solo has been used to broadcast information and propaganda for the United States over a variety of television and radio frequencies. It has been used in several areas of operation, including Bosnia and Iraq.

==Pirate television==
In 1969, news stories began to appear in the United Kingdom that Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly, the founder of the pirate radio ship based service called Radio Caroline, which at that time was not on the air, was about to launch Caroline Television instead. His plans called for two aircraft, one in service and one as a relief, which would transmit commercial television programs to Britain by Stratovision. Although these stories continued for some time, nothing became of the project. To date no pirate radio or television service has ever operated by means of Stratovision.

==Use as a temporary service==
The advent of fibre optic cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite services has supplanted Stratovision as a permanent means of television delivery. The Stratovision concept continues to be used as a stop-gap measure where land-based transmitters are not possible and where large areas of territory need to be served with a television program.

==Popular culture==
* The plot of the 1986 comedy film &quot;Riders of the Storm&quot; (also known as &quot;The American Way&quot;) is based on a similar concept, with a group of Vietnam veterans running a pirate television station (&quot;S&amp;M TV&quot;) from a B-29 that was constantly in flight.
* A similar system, using helicopters, is mentioned in the 1950 Robert A. Heinlein story &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;.

<doc id="1256935" wikidata="Q143390" url="?curid=1256935" title="Paléo Festival">
<text>The Paléo Festival de Nyon, usually just called Paléo, is an annual rock festival held in Nyon, Switzerland. It started in a small way in 1976 as the Nyon Folk Festival. The first one was held in the village hall in Nyon. From 1977 until 1989, it was held at Colovray, Nyon, by Lake Geneva and had only two stages, but today it is one of the major open-air music festivals in mainland Europe and the biggest in Switzerland. Today the event has grown to include international artists. In 1990, it moved to its current location, at the Plaine de l&#x27;Asse, accessible either by walking, bus or the Chemin de fer Nyon-St-Cergue-Morez narrow-gauge railway.

The festival lasts six days at the end of July, from Tuesday to Sunday, and the final main stage concert is preceded by a great firework display with music.

As of 2005, 3.5 million spectators and 2500 artists had been part of the Paléo Festival.

==Stages==

The Paléo features six stages:
* &quot;La Grande Scène&quot; (the Main Stage)
* &quot;Vega&quot; (Which replaced Les Arches in 2022)
* &quot;Le Club Tent&quot; (the Club Tent)
* &quot;La Ruche&quot; (the hive) (formerly called &#x27;La Crique&#x27;)
* &quot;Le Dôme&quot; (the Dome)
* &quot;Belleville&quot; (since 2022, dedicated to electronic music)
* &quot;Le Détour&quot; (regional bands now located inside the festival, formerly called &#x27;FMR&#x27; which was a free stage)

Since 2003, the Paléo has introduced Le Village du Monde (The World Village) section, which is a space reserved for an invited region of the world. This place offers the region&#x27;s culture and food. It also includes Le Dôme which shows only artists from the invited region.

280,000 visitors and over 5,000 staff participated in the 2015 event.

==Tickets==
Tickets can be purchased on the Paléo Website.
Special offers are available usually as early as November of the year preceding the next Paléo festival with discounted all-week passes. Later in Spring the official programme is published and the second, slightly less discounted tickets are available. They are often sold out very quickly. In the months preceding the festival more tickets are sold at full price.

To fight black-market ticket sales, 1500 one-day tickets are held up to be sold the same day as their validity date and can be purchased online (to be printed by the buyer).

The lineup used to be revealed on a late April Wednesday at noon, following which, both tickets and passes would sell out within days. From 2008 onwards, the lineup is unveiled one week prior to the sale, giving people plenty of time to make up their mind and thus rushing them online to get their tickets one week later. In 2009, all 280,000 tickets and passes were sold in a record one-and-a-half hours.

<doc id="1256944" wikidata="Q1444699" url="?curid=1256944" title="Descent II">
<text>Descent II is a 1996 first-person shooter game developed by Parallax Software and first published for DOS by Interplay Productions. A version for the PlayStation was released under the title Descent Maximum. It is the second installment in the &quot;Descent&quot; video game series and the sequel to &quot;Descent&quot;. The player controls a spaceship from the pilot&#x27;s perspective and must navigate extrasolar underground mines to locate and destroy their reactors and escape being caught in their self-destructions, while engaging and surviving infected robots, which will attempt to destroy the ship. Unlike other first-person shooters, its six-degrees-of-freedom scheme allows the player to move and rotate in any three-dimensional space and direction.

&quot;Descent II&quot; started as a project intended to expand the original using a compact disc&#x27;s storage, and later became a standalone product. The game received very positive reviews from video game critics, who widely lauded the multiplayer mode and the inclusion of the Guide-Bot, a scouting robot that guides the player to their objectives. The PlayStation version&#x27;s reception was rather mixed, with critics often disagreeing in their evaluations of its frame rate. A sequel, &quot;Descent 3&quot;, was released in 1999.

== Gameplay ==
Like its predecessor, &quot;Descent II&quot; is a six-degrees-of-freedom shoot &#x27;em up game in which the player pilots a fighter spaceship from a first-person perspective in zero gravity. It differs from standard first-person shooters in that it allows the player to move freely across three-dimensional planes and rotate on three axes, often termed pitch, yaw, and roll. Besides the keyboard, &quot;Descent II&quot; features a wide range of supported hardware configurations with which to play it, including the Gravis Gamepad and certain brands of joysticks, some of which support force feedback—making it one of the earliest PC games to support force feedback. Virtual reality and stereoscopic graphics are also officially supported.

In the game&#x27;s single-player mode, the player must complete four levels in each of six differently themed star systems where different types of robots attempt to hinder the player&#x27;s progress. In each level, the player must find and destroy the mine&#x27;s reactor and then escape the mine through an exit door before the mine self-destructs. Every fourth level has a boss robot that takes the place of the reactor. Each level is composed of rooms separated by doors, most of which can be opened by shooting or bumping into them. Some other doors are colored blue, yellow, or red and require a key of the corresponding color to be opened. In addition to brightening passages by shooting flares or turning on a headlight if the latter has been picked up, at least three measures can be used to prevent getting lost in the mines, two of which are using a wireframe automap that documents all explored areas of the mine and dropping markers in certain locations. The markers are displayed on the automap. Along the way, the player may also find and free a Guide-Bot, a commandable scouting assistant that guides the player to a specified objective or powerup. Additionally, many stages have human hostages that award an additional point bonus if they are rescued before completing the level.

Within each level, the player may find and collect power-ups scattered throughout the mine or dropped by dying robots. Many of the power-ups expand the ship&#x27;s weaponry, which is divided into primary and secondary weapons. Primary weapons range from a variety of pulse lasers and plasma bolts, and all of them consume energy in varying increments, except for two rotary cannons whose ammunition consists of explosive shells instead. Secondary weapons include many types of missiles, and mines which are dropped behind the player&#x27;s ship to slow pursuing enemies. Ten new weapons have been added for &quot;Descent II&quot; of which some are upgrades from the original &quot;Descent&quot; weapons which are all present as well; new weapons include the Phoenix cannon which fires energy orbs that rebound off walls, the Omega cannon which fires electrostatic discharge, and the Guided Missile which can be remote piloted by the player. The player can also collect equipment items which grant special abilities. For example, a converter exists for converting energy in excess of 100 units into shields, whereas the afterburner allows the player to temporarily fly forward twice as fast. Levels may contain energy stations the player can fly through to recharge their ship&#x27;s energy level while in motion, as well as generators that spawn more robots. Shooting out certain control panels causes a variety of events, such as doors opening, walls being removed, or force fields being deactivated. In a few levels, behind some hidden doors are teleporters that warp the player to the current star system&#x27;s secret level. These secret levels are not required to complete the game but contain many power-ups, and can be revisited provided that their reactors have not been destroyed and the teleporters are discovered. Players cannot save the game in a secret level, and have to teleport back to a regular level in order to save their game progress.

The player&#x27;s ship is protected by a shield which decreases when incurring damage from attacks and collisions with force fields, is replenished by picking up shield power-ups, and like energy is limited by a capacity of 200 units. If the shield is fully depleted and the ship takes any additional damage, the ship will explode, costing the player one life and killing any hostages on board, leaving most of its weapons where it was destroyed. A respawning player has to start at the level entrance with a ship having only minimum armaments, so it is often challenging to retrieve their previous ship&#x27;s weapons. New to &quot;Descent II&quot; is the ability to drop weapons, so a player can stockpile surplus weaponry in safe locations in the event of a respawn. Failing to escape the mine during the self-destruct sequence will also cost the player a life, as well as their power-ups, and any hostages embarked, although having destroyed the reactor or boss robot the player will still advance to the next level. If the player loses all lives, the game will end, and their high scores are recorded. Points are gained for destroying robots, rescuing the hostages, and end-of-level bonuses based on the player&#x27;s performance with score multipliers for escaping the mine; scoring enough points results in an extra life.

&quot;Descent II&quot; also features a multiplayer mode whereby two to eight players can compete against each other in several game types, which include a deathmatch mode called Anarchy and Capture-the-Flag, in which two teams compete against each other to capture opposing flags. Conditions for ending the level such as maximum time limit, how long the reactor will remain invulnerable before it can be destroyed, and the number of kills to reach can be set, as can which power-ups to allow and whether players may drop surveillance cameras. The game also features a co-operative mode that allows up to four players to work together to complete single-player levels. A player can send messages and predefined taunts, handicap their ship&#x27;s shields they begin with after respawning, and in Capture-the-Flag drop and pass flags to their teammates. &quot;Descent II&quot;″s multiplayer was designed for modems, null-modems, and local area networks, but an alternative then widely used is to use third-party software such as Kali to play the game on the Internet. It is possible to have DOS and Macintosh versions of the game play on the same server, providing a cross-platform experience. The PlayStation version has a two-player mode that requires a link cable used to connect two consoles running the same game. It contains the same game modes as found in the original DOS version, except for Capture-the-Flag.

== Plot ==
The plot is linear and is mostly provided for the introductory and concluding full-motion video cutscenes. After the &quot;Material Defender&quot; (voiced by George DelHoyo) has destroyed all of the Solar System&#x27;s mines in the original game, he stops in the asteroid belt to dock. He is then contacted by Post-Terran Mining Corporation executive Dravis, who exploits a loophole in a contract to coerce him to accept a new mission or forfeit his reward and face legal action. The Material Defender consents, and as Dravis tries to convince him that he is merely embarking on a reconnaissance mission, his ship is fitted with a prototype warp core. He is then sent to clear out PTMC&#x27;s deep space mines beyond the Solar System.

The Material Defender teleports to Zeta Aquilae and five other, fictional star systems and destroys their mines. In the sixth system, the last mine seems to run all through a planetoid, which is revealed in the final cutscene to be a large spaceship. After the spaceship breaks apart, the Material Defender alerts Dravis to his return home, but his warp drive malfunctions and he teleports to an unknown location. The camera then fades to that location and the ship appears, heavily damaged and crackling with excess radiation drifting towards the camera, ending with the words &quot;to be continued...&quot; being displayed.

== Development ==
Parallax Software began &quot;Descent II&quot;″s development as an expansion pack for the original &quot;Descent&quot; game using a CD&#x27;s storage, but it later evolved into a separate project lasting about one year. &quot;Descent II&quot;″s graphics were upgraded to operate at Super VGA standards, and can also take advantage of 3D acceleration graphics cards. The MIDI soundtrack was composed by Dan Wentz, whereas the included redbook features industrial metal contributed by notable musicians such as Type O Negative and Ogre of Skinny Puppy. It cost to produce the game.

&quot;Descent II&quot;″s portal engine remained fundamentally unchanged; it operates on the premise of adjacent cubes or polyhedra whose sides connecting them form portals. The scenes that are drawn are the cube the player ship is in and the areas of other cubes the camera can see through their portals, and the process is repeated as the player enters a different polyhedron. Cubes can be deformed so long as they remain convex. Respectively, these prevent overdraw and accelerate portal rendering, making the engine practical to run on even inexpensive personal computers of that time. The precedeing &quot;Descent&quot; introduced a dynamic light-sourcing scheme by which the environment could be lit with flares, while newly added in &quot;Descent II&quot; is the ability to shoot out sources of light which will darken rooms as well as a headlight powerup which can continuously illuminate the space in front of the player.

The game&#x27;s directors, Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog, explained they upgraded the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence to contain instructions mimicking the tactics they saw players use in multiplayer mode, such as dodging behind walls and sneaking up from behind. The C-written code composing the AI was expanded to about 4,000 lines, a task the two described as being difficult.

===Releases===
The &quot;Descent II&quot; demo was released in December 1995, becoming one of the most downloaded PC games in January 1996. Unlike the preceding &quot;Descent&quot; whose shareware release could be upgraded to the full version while leaving the existing shareware files intact including player saves, the &quot;Descent II&quot; demo was a self-contained program that was not upgradable to the full version. Like the original &quot;Descent&quot; the demo version of Descent II presented the story as still screens with text and also uses the in-game engine for the mine escape sequence; while the full version replaces all of these with full-motion video pre-rendered cutscenes incorporating voice acting. The demo features eight of ten weapons from the first &quot;Descent&quot; and six of ten weapons from the full &quot;Descent II&quot;. The &quot;Descent II&quot; demo featured the first three regular levels of the game (the teleporter to the secret level was disabled), after completing the third level the player moves from Zeta Aquilae to a new star system with the story to be continued. The full release (see below) adds a fourth regular level (with a boss in lieu of the reactor) as well as the secret level to the Zeta Aquilae system, making it in line with the next five star systems (each has four regular levels plus a secret level), for a total of 30 levels.

The full base &quot;Descent II&quot; game was published for DOS by Interplay in the United States on March 13, 1996, and in the United Kingdom on March 29, 1996. It was co-distributed by LaserSoft Imaging, whom Interplay gave the rights as part of a settlement after the former lost a court battle regarding its product add-on for the first &quot;Descent&quot; game, which Interplay alleged infringed its trademark—setting a precedent for how companies can sell add-ons for protected games. Interplay&#x27;s division specified in Macintosh games, MacPlay, published it for Macintosh in August 1996.

&quot;Descent II: Destination Quartzon&quot; was a truncated version with the first eight regular levels and two secret levels (constituting the first and second star systems, &quot;Zeta Aquilae&quot; and &quot;Quartzon&quot;). Not compatible with the &quot;Descent II&quot; full release, &quot;Destination Quartzon&quot; was bundled software with hardware such as the Logitech WingMan Extreme joystick and Diamond Multimedia video cards with the Voodoo Graphics chipset.

In November 1996 came &quot;Descent II: The Infinite Abyss&quot;, a Windows 95 upgrade that supports 3D accelerated graphics, contains &quot;The Vertigo Series&quot; add-on, and the original DOS game patched to support accelerated graphics. &quot;The Vertigo Series&quot;, which could be purchased separately, contains 22 new levels (to be played sequentially), a new multiplayer game mode, new music and enemies. The add-on is also bundled with the Mission Builder, a level and robot editor that can also convert the original &quot;Descent&quot;″s levels for this game.

The PlayStation version of &quot;Descent II&quot;, known as &quot;Descent Maximum&quot;, was launched on May 15, 1997 in North America and in mid-1997 in Europe. Instead of a straight port, it had 36 new levels, textures and full-motion video over the PC version of &quot;Descent II&quot;.

On October 29, 1997, Interplay published &quot;Descent I and II: The Definitive Collection&quot;, a compilation containing the full versions of &quot;Descent&quot;, the &quot;Levels of the World&quot; mission pack, &quot;Descent II&quot;, and &quot;Vertigo&quot; mission packs, and a mission editor. Besides a choice of the original &quot;Descent II&quot; levels (subtitled &quot;Counterstrike&quot;), or the &quot;Vertigo Series&quot; levels, the first &quot;Descent&quot; levels (subtitled &quot;The First Strike&quot;) can be started in the &quot;Descent II&quot; game UI where robots adopt the &quot;Descent II&quot; sounds and improved AI. There is also a preview for the upcoming &quot;Descent 3&quot;.

In 1998, the &quot;Descent II&quot; source code, like that of &quot;Descent&quot; before it, was released to the general public under a copyrighted proprietary license, leading to community source ports. It was later ported to RISC OS by R-Comp Interactive, and the port debuted at the annual Wakefield Acorn RISC OS Show on May 19, 2001.

&quot;Descent II&quot; entered digital distribution when it appeared on GameTap on September 7, 2006. It subsequently became one of the launch titles of the Good Old Games beta on September 8, 2008, and on February 19, 2014, it was re-released on Valve&#x27;s Steam digital distribution service. However, the &quot;Descent&quot; trilogy was withdrawn from Good Old Games in December 2015 after its creators, Mike Kulas and Matt Toschlog, alleged that Interplay, who owns the &quot;Descent&quot; trademark but not the copyright of the trilogy, had not paid the developers royalties on their sale since 2007. As a result, Parallax terminated the 21-year sales agreement, revoking from Interplay the permission to distribute the trilogy. Later, the games were also removed from Steam. The trilogy returned on Good Old Games for sale in November 2017 and later on Steam.

== Reception ==
Upon release, &quot;Descent II&quot; received very positive reviews from video game critics. Citing its replay value, &quot;GameSpot&quot; commented: &quot;If you don&#x27;t like &quot;Descent&quot; at least a little bit, make no mistake, there is something wrong with you.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; opined that a few sequels &quot;can boast the improvements like those made on &quot;Descent II&quot;&quot;, citing the SVGA graphics, the story sequences in full motion video, and the new items. It forgave the same simple mission formula because of the improvements. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; compared the gameplay and enhancements of the sequel to those of &quot;Doom II&quot;, but complained about the graininess of the textures, and the two magazines warned that players who did not care for the original might not care for the sequel either.

The addition of the Guide-Bot was well-received. In a very positive review, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; considered it to be a valuable addition to the game &quot;because the automap is just as confusing as it was in the original game&quot;. Conversely, &quot;PC Review&quot; felt the Guide-Bot ran contrary to the disorienting character of the series and that the Guide-Bot diminished the need to use strategy, but did write that using the robot was optional. &quot;Computer Game Review&quot; liked the AI of the new cast of robots in general and other measures taken to prevent getting lost, such as plotting map positions with markers. The multiplayer mode was also widely lauded. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; called the Capture-the-Flag mode &quot;intensely enjoyable&quot;, but expressed concerns about the lack of outdoor levels (these were added in the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Descent 3&quot;, released in 1999). Other critics differed in how they analyzed the level design. &quot;PC PowerPlay&quot; strongly praised the scenery and the combination of maneuvers, including shooting while strafing and turning, with the &quot;adventurous&quot; style of the levels. While calling the levels innovative, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; found there to be too many &quot;claustrophobic&quot; and labyrinthine levels. The latter view was disputed by &quot;PC Zone&quot;, who described the levels as being more &quot;complex and overlapping&quot; compared to the original&#x27;s, which it described were focused on &quot;winding tunnels, tiny chambers, huge caverns which lead to micro alleyways, long cramped corridors [etc.]&quot;. However, the two magazines agreed that the levels were too hard on easier difficulty settings. &quot;PC Zone&quot; also praised support for virtual reality. &quot;Maximum&quot; wrote that the levels retained the 3D sensations and &quot;ingenious structural design&quot;, but asserted the game&#x27;s difficulty was made less frustrating because of the abundance of shield orbs, the inclusion of powerful weapons, and the ability to transfer energy to shields. &quot;Total Games Network&quot; described the music when played on a stereo system as a &quot;veritable sonic maelstrom.&quot;

Reviews for the Macintosh version iterated many critical points found in those for the DOS version. Making similar comments about this version as the ones about &quot;Descent II&quot; for DOS, &quot;Next Generation&quot; noted it as an unusual case of a Macintosh port releasing shortly after the DOS version. &quot;GameRevolution&quot; enthusiastically lauded the graphics and the fluidity of the animations, its only criticism being the complexity of controlling the ship using only the keyboard and not a joystick. It thus highly recommended using one, and also suggested that a direction indicator would have helped beginners become adjusted to the controls. &quot;Macworld&quot; judged the graphics to be &quot;extremely detailed and well rendered&quot;, but noted that some smaller robots resembled origami. &quot;MacADDICT&quot; wrote that the use of animated textures by the levels&#x27; new settings brought about a realistic alien world. It also put forth criticisms specifically for the Macintosh version, such as the high system requirements for the Power Mac and freezes that can lead to corrupt player files, which can be prevented by turning off all of the nonessential system extensions. The two aforementioned reviewers cautioned about the game&#x27;s potential to induce motion sickness, but ultimately recommended it.

The PlayStation version received rather mixed reviews. Most of the critics praised the artificial intelligence. The most negative reviews came from Glenn Rubenstein of &quot;GameSpot&quot; and Shawn Smith of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, both of whom said they disliked the entire &quot;Descent&quot; series and its basic concept of 3D navigation in levels which have no clear &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;, as well as &quot;GameFan&quot;, which lambasted the habitual inferiority of PlayStation ports of good PC games. Smith and his three co-reviewers all criticized the choppy frame rate, though Crispin Boyer noted that the problem is largely eliminated when playing with the cockpit displays on. Both Boyer and Dan Hsu praised the additions over the original &quot;Descent&quot;, such as the Guide-Bot and the new lighting effects. Both &quot;GameFan&quot; and Dmitry Reznikov of &quot;GameLand&quot; lauded all of the PC version&#x27;s improvements included in the port, but the former reported an average rate of ten frames per second that would drop even lower with the cockpit displays disabled, and the latter believed that the frame rate drops cost an otherwise straight port of the PC version the opportunity to become a PlayStation hit. Rubenstein disputed the criticisms of the frame rate, which he called smooth, and &quot;GamePro&quot; said the frame rate only drops when the action is at its most intense. He praised the additions to the original &quot;Descent&quot; such as the FMV cutscenes, the Guide-Bot, and the Thief-Bot. &quot;Next Generation&quot; was also pleased with these elements, summarizing that the game &quot;features just enough improvements to the aging series to make it a welcome addition to the fold&quot;. However, it judged that the &quot;Descent&quot; series lacked the intensity and mood of competitors such as &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;. These views were echoed by Roger Burchill of &quot;Ultra Game Players&quot;, who felt that the &quot;Doom&quot;-styled gameplay became dated, though he did welcome the link cable-based multiplayer mode.

&quot;Descent II&quot; was a finalist for CNET Gamecenter&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Best Action Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Quake&quot;. The editors wrote that &quot;&quot;Descent II&quot; offered even more insane vertigo action than the original, plus an added bonus that set the tone for computer gaming in 1996--a multiplayer mode&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Descent II&quot; the 123rd-best computer game ever released. It was also ranked  46 on &quot;PC PowerPlay&quot;″s list of the 50 games of the century, due to the game&#x27;s &quot;schizophrenically devised&quot; maps, robots&#x27; artificial intelligence, and atmosphere whose intensity the magazine considered to be previously unparalleled. Later in 2000, the same magazine ranked it No. 90 on their list of the top 100 games of all time, calling it the best of the &quot;Descent&quot; series.

<text>The Schilling test was a medical investigation used for patients with vitamin B (cobalamin) deficiency. The purpose of the test was to determine how well a patient is able to absorb B12 from their intestinal tract. The test is now considered obsolete and is rarely performed, and is no longer available at many medical centers. It is named for Robert F. Schilling.

==Process==
The Schilling test has multiple stages. As noted below, it can be done at any time after vitamin B supplementation and body store replacement, and some clinicians recommend that in severe deficiency cases, at least several weeks of vitamin repletion be done before the test (more than one B shot, and also oral folic acid), in order to ensure that impaired absorption of B (with or without intrinsic factor) is not occurring due to damage to the intestinal mucosa from the B and folate deficiency themselves.

===Stage 1: oral vitamin B plus intramuscular vitamin B12 (without IF) ===
In the first part of the test, the patient is given radiolabeled vitamin B to drink or eat. The most commonly used radiolabels are 57Co and 58Co. An intramuscular injection of unlabeled vitamin B is given an hour later. This is not enough to replete or saturate body stores of B. The purpose of the single injection is to temporarily saturate B receptors in the liver with enough normal vitamin B to prevent radioactive vitamin B binding in body tissues (especially in the liver), so that if absorbed from the G.I. tract, it will pass into the urine. The patient&#x27;s urine is then collected over the next 24 hours to assess the absorption.

Normally, the ingested radiolabeled vitamin B will be absorbed into the body. Since the body already has liver receptors for transcobalamin/vitamin B saturated by the injection, much of the ingested vitamin B will be excreted in the urine.

* A normal result shows at least 10% of the radiolabeled vitamin B in the urine over the first 24 hours.
* In patients with pernicious anemia or with deficiency due to impaired absorption, less than 10% of the radiolabeled vitamin B is detected.

The normal test will result in a higher amount of the radiolabeled cobalamin in the urine because it would have been absorbed by the intestinal epithelium, but passed into the urine because all hepatic B12 receptors were occupied. An abnormal result is caused by less of the labeled cobalamin to appear in the urine because it will remain in the intestine and be passed into the feces.

===Stage 2: vitamin B and intrinsic factor ===
If an abnormality is found, i.e. the B12 in the urine is only present in low levels, the test is repeated, this time with additional oral intrinsic factor.

* If this second urine collection is normal, this shows a lack of intrinsic factor production. This is by definition pernicious anemia.
* A low result on the second test implies abnormal intestinal absorption (malabsorption), which could be caused by coeliac disease, biliary disease, Whipple&#x27;s disease, small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome, fish tapeworm infestation (Diphyllobothrium latum), or liver disease. Malabsorption of B can be caused by intestinal dysfunction from a low vitamin level in-and-of-itself (see below), causing test result confusion if repletion has not been done for some days previously.

===Stage 3: vitamin B and antibiotics ===
This stage is useful for identifying patients with bacterial overgrowth syndrome. The physician will provide a course of 2 weeks of antibiotics to eliminate any possible bacterial overgrowth and repeat the test to check whether radio-labeled Vitamin B12 would be found in urine or not.

===Stage 4: vitamin B and pancreatic enzymes ===
This stage, in which pancreatic enzymes are administered, can be useful in identifying patients with pancreatic insufficiency. The physician will give 3 days of pancreatic enzymes followed by repeating the test to check if radio-labeled Vitamin B12 would be detected in urine.

===Combined stage 1 and stage 2===
In some versions of the Schilling test, B can be given both with and without intrinsic factor at the same time, using different cobalt radioisotopes 57Co and 58Co, which have different radiation signatures, in order to differentiate the two forms of B. This is performed with the &#x27;Dicopac&#x27; kitset. This allows for only a single radioactive urine collection.

==Complications==
Note that the B shot which begins the Schilling test is enough to go a considerable way toward treating B deficiency, so the test is also a partial &quot;treatment&quot; for B deficiency. Also, the classic Schilling test can be performed at any time, even after full B repletion and correction of the anemia, and it will still show if the cause of the B deficiency was intrinsic-factor related. In fact, some clinicians have suggested that folate and B replacement for several weeks be normally performed &quot;before&quot; a Schilling test is done, since folate and B deficiencies are both known to interfere with intestinal cell function, and thus cause malabsorption of B on their own, even if intrinsic factor is being made. This state would then tend to cause a false-positive test for both simple B and intrinsic factor-related B malabsorption. Several weeks of vitamin replacement are necessary, before epithelial damage to the G.I. tract from B deficiency is corrected.

Many labs have stopped performing the Schilling test, due to lack of production of the cobalt radioisotopes and labeled-B test substances. Also, injection replacement of B has become relatively inexpensive, and can be self-administered by patients, as well as megadose oral B. Since these are the same treatments which would be administered for most causes of B malabsorption even if the exact cause were identified, the diagnostic test may be omitted without damage to the patient (so long as follow-up treatment and occasional serum B testing is not allowed to lapse).

It is possible for use of other radiopharmaceuticals to interfere with interpretation of the test.

<doc id="1256956" wikidata="Q2304393" url="?curid=1256956" title="A Charlie Brown Christmas (soundtrack)">
<text>A Charlie Brown Christmas is the eighth studio album by the American jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi (later credited to the Vince Guaraldi Trio). It was released in December1965 by Fantasy Records to coincide with the debut of the television special &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; featuring the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic characters.

Guaraldi was contacted by the television producer Lee Mendelson to compose music for a documentary on &quot;Peanuts&quot; and its creator, Charles M. Schulz. Although the documentary went unaired, selections of the music were released in 1964 as &quot;Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. The Coca-Cola Company commissioned a &quot;Peanuts&quot; Christmas special in 1965 and Guaraldi returned to score the special.

Guaraldi composed most of the music, though he included versions of traditional carols such as &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot;. He recorded at Whitney Studio in Glendale, California, then re-recorded parts at Fantasy Records Studios in San Francisco with a children&#x27;s choir from St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in San Rafael, California. The sessions ran late into the night, with the children rewarded with ice cream afterward. Bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli were credited as performing on the album. 

&quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. In November 2014, it was the 10th best-selling Christmas/holiday album in the United States during the SoundScan era. In 2022, it was certified five times platinum for sales of 5 million copies.

==Background==
By the early 1960s, Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot; had become a sensation worldwide. The television producer Lee Mendelson, a fan of jazz, heard &quot;Cast Your Fate to the Wind&quot;, composed by the jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi, and contacted him to produce music for a &quot;Peanuts&quot; documentary, &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. Guaraldi created the piece &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; to serve as the theme. Despite the popularity of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, television networks were not interested in the special and it went unaired.

In April 1965, &quot;Time&quot; featured &quot;Peanuts&quot; on its cover, highlighting its cultural impact. That year, the Coca-Cola Company commissioned the Christmas-themed special &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;. Guaraldi, fresh from recording &quot;At Grace Cathedral&quot; with St. Paul&#x27;s Church of San Rafael&#x27;s 68-voice choir, returned to compose the score.

==Recording and production==
The recording process for &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; involved numerous sessions during late 1965. These sessions were characterized by blown takes, cross-chatter, and experimentation as Guaraldi and his musicians worked to perfect each track. Drummers and bassists were rotated frequently, contributing to the challenge of identifying which musicians were responsible for particular tracks. Despite Guaraldi&#x27;s habit of not keeping detailed records of his session players, it has been established that bassists Monty Budwig and Fred Marshall, along with drummers Colin Bailey and Jerry Granelli, were involved in various recording stages. Nearly three decades later, Fantasy surmised that the recordings with Budwig and Bailey were employed in the television special while Marshall and Granelli recorded the album. Other musicians have claimed to have recorded the special&#x27;s music: bassists Eugene Firth and Al Obidinski and drummers Paul Distel and Benny Barth. Firth and Distil are noted as performers on a studio-session report Guaraldi filed for the American Federation of Musicians.

The initial instrumentals were recorded by Guaraldi at Whitney Studio in Glendale, California, on March 6, 1965. Guaraldi incorporated &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot; as the central theme for the &quot;Peanuts&quot; franchise, a piece originally recorded on October 26, 1964, with Budwig and Bailey for the album &quot;Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. This earlier version is featured on the soundtrack album. The version used in the television special (#4, Take 1) was recorded on September 17, 1965, with Marshall and Granelli. The second bridge section of this rendition is notably highlighted during a scene where Snoopy exuberantly dances on Schroeder&#x27;s piano before halting mid-performance in embarrassment.

In addition to revisiting &quot;Linus and Lucy&quot;, Guaraldi composed two pieces for the special: &quot;Skating&quot; and &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot;. This new music played a pivotal role in defining the tone of the production, with its instrumentation effectively conveying the whimsical yet introspective nature of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; characters and their world.

The recording of &quot;Skating&quot; showcased the scrupulous nature of Guaraldi&#x27;s jazz compositions. The trio experienced difficulties in the initial session, particularly with the syncopation and characteristic keyboard &quot;cascade effect.&quot; Several takes were needed to refine the structure and feel of the piece, with Guaraldi eventually guiding the group to the final version after numerous attempts. The take (#3, Take 7), noted for its subtle energy, was included in the soundtrack with a fade-out to conclude the track.

The recording process for &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot;, originally titled &quot;Snow Waltz,&quot; was characterized by meticulous attention to detail as Guaraldi and his trio worked through multiple takes to achieve a balance between the song&#x27;s inherent melancholy and a warm, inviting tone. The final instrumental version (#6, Take 2), which lasted six minutes, was selected for the soundtrack album. Later, a choral rendition featuring lyrics hastily penned by producer Lee Mendelson in approximately 15 minutes was recorded by the St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church choir. This choir, under the direction of Barry Mineah, had previously collaborated with Guaraldi during his 1965 jazz mass performance at Grace Cathedral. The choir&#x27;s role in the special, which included performances of &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot; and &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot;, was integral to the authenticity of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; universe. 

The recording sessions, held at Fantasy Studios in late autumn 1965, spanned three sessions over two weeks and often extended late into the night, leading to the involvement of different children at each session due to some parents&#x27; refusal to allow their children to return. Mineah&#x27;s pursuit of perfection contrasted with Mendelson and Guaraldi&#x27;s desire for a more natural sound, resulting in the use of a slightly off-key version of &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; in the final cut. In addition to their musical contributions, the children recorded dialogue for the special&#x27;s closing scene, joyfully exclaiming, &quot;Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!&quot; The children were compensated with five dollars each for their participation. One choir member, Candace Hackett Shively, became an elementary school teacher and fondly recalled the recording sessions, including post-session ice cream outings, which she shared with her students every holiday season.
The version of the German carol &quot;O Tannenbaum&quot;, approximately five minutes long (#2, Take 1), maintained the carol&#x27;s structure while allowing Guaraldi&#x27;s piano to explore its harmonic potential within a jazz framework. Several shorter takes were also recorded, including an up-tempo version that was ultimately set aside as it did not fit the mood of the television special. One of these brief interpretations (#2, Take 5) was used during a pivotal scene, adding emotional depth as Charlie Brown exits the school theater carrying his small Christmas tree.

The recording of &quot;Christmas Is Coming&quot; posed unique challenges, with the trio making several attempts to capture the lively energy of the piece. During the first session, Guaraldi and his group encountered rhythm disruptions and issues with the keyboard bridge, resulting in multiple abandoned takes. However, by the end of the session, they produced a version that, while not perfect, showed promise. In a subsequent session, they refined the arrangement, eventually producing the final take used on the soundtrack. The bright, bossa nova-inflected track showcases Guaraldi&#x27;s ability to balance jazz improvisation with the structured demands of an animated special.

Additional music was later added to the special, post-broadcast, including songs like &quot;Charlie Brown Theme&quot; and &quot;Happiness Theme&quot; from &quot;Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;, as well as &quot;Air Music&quot; from &quot;Charlie Brown&#x27;s All Stars!&quot;. These tracks were not included in the original soundtrack release. Furthermore, while tracks such as &quot;What Child Is This&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; were recorded for the album, they were not featured in the special itself.

==Reception and legacy==
===Commercial performance===
On May 10, 2022, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album quintuple platinum for sales of 5 million copies, making it the second-best-selling jazz album in history, behind Miles Davis&#x27; &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; (1959).

&quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; first appeared on a &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine music sales chart on the week of December 19, 1987, when it debuted and peaked at No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Christmas Albums sales chart. The album charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Christmas Albums chart every Christmas/holiday season from 1988 through 2003, peaking as high as No. 8 in both 2001 and 2002. The album also charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Catalog Albums chart during the Christmas/holiday season every year from 1991 through 2003, peaking as high as No. 6 in 2001. In November 2014, it was the 10th best-selling Christmas/holiday album in the United States during the SoundScan era.

It became the first jazz soundtrack album to reach the Top 10 outside of a specialty album chart (i.e. Christmas Albums, Top Pop Catalog Albums, Kids Albums) when, in January 2021, it reached No. 10 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Derrick Bang, Guaraldi historian and author of &quot;Vince Guaraldi at the Piano&quot;, noted the significance of such a &quot;huge&quot; accomplishment, with Guaraldi sharing top spots with Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney and Eminem.

&quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was also the 10th best-selling holiday album of 2011, a year that marked the sixth time since 2001 that the album had ranked among the year&#x27;s top 10 Christmas albums. It was also the ninth best-selling album of 2013. On November 18, 2021, it was ranked as the No. 1 Greatest Holiday 200 album of All Time by &quot;Billboard&quot;. The American singer-songwriter Aimee Mann cited &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; as an influence on her 2006 Christmas album &quot;One More Drifter in the Snow&quot;, saying it captured the &quot;mellow and sometimes sad mood&quot; of the holiday season.

===Critical reception===

AllMusic reviewer Shawn M. Haney called it &quot;joyous and festive meditation for the holiday season&quot; writing, &quot;Guaraldi strings together elegant, enticing arrangements that reflect the spirit and mood of Schulz&#x27;s work.&quot; Dominique Leone at &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the songs &quot;small, observant miracles...If there&#x27;s a muted quality to a lot of this music, it&#x27;s smiling nonetheless.&quot;

The soundtrack to &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; has been considered &quot;one of the most beloved holiday albums recorded.&quot; Chris Barton of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; asserts that the soundtrack introduced jazz to an entirely new generation, having been heard by more individuals than the work of the genre&#x27;s most influential players, including Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The score influenced dozens of young aspiring musicians, among them David Benoit and George Winston. Haney wrote that the record &quot;introduce[d] contemporary jazz to youngsters with grace, charm, and creativity.&quot; In 2019, it was ranked the fourth greatest Christmas album of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

&quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2012 the album was added to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Reissues ==
In 2022, Craft Recordings embarked on a major reissue campaign in a variety of expanded, deluxe editions. These sets feature a new stereo mix completed by Paul Blakemore, the original 1965 stereo mix, and up to 50 previously unreleased outtakes from five separate recording sessions. The three editions are a single LP vinyl edition, comprising the original 1965 stereo release offered in gold foil sleeved with embossing details (released September 22, 2022); two-disc LP vinyl and CD expanded editions, containing the 2022 stereo mix and 13 outtakes from the original recording sessions (released December 2, 2022); and a five-disc super deluxe edition, which adds three CDs of complete Autumn 1965 recording sessions and a Blu-ray audio disc containing high-resolution audio and Dolby Atmos mixes (released December 2, 2022).

<text>Norges Bank (, , ) is the central bank of Norway. It is responsible for managing the Government Pension Fund of Norway, which is the world&#x27;s largest sovereign wealth fund, as well as the bank&#x27;s own foreign exchange reserves. 

==History==

The history of the central bank of Norway can be traced back to 1816, when, two years after the separation from Denmark and the union with Sweden, Norges Bank was established by an Act of the Storting (the Norwegian parliament) on 14 June. The bank then decided that the monetary unit was to be the speciedaler (rixdollar), divided into 120 skillings or five ort (&quot;rigsort&quot;) of 24 skillings each.

The Money Act of 17 April 1875 discontinued the terms daler and skilling, and it was decided that the monetary unit should be a krone, divided into 100 øre. This was done to prepare for Norway&#x27;s entry, on 16 October that year, into the Scandinavian Monetary Union. This union had been established between Denmark and Sweden in 1873 on the recommendation of a joint commission (in which Norway participated) to establish a common Scandinavian coin based on gold. It meant that the other countries&#x27; coins were to be legal tender on the same basis as those struck at home. The union functioned until 1914; thereafter it lacked all practical significance, but was not formally abolished until 1972.

On 1 January 1897 the seat of Norges Bank was moved to Kristiania (Oslo) from Trondheim, and in 1906 a new headquarters building on Bankplassen was opened - for 80 employees including the workers in the banknote printing plant.

During the Second World War, the seat of Norges Bank was temporarily moved to London in 1940, in that the Norwegian government-in-exile established a new board. The bank&#x27;s gold reserves were evacuated via Åndalsnes, Molde and Tromsø to London, and from there to New York and Ottawa. This gold and the bank&#x27;s other currency reserves were under the control of the London board. At the same time, the bank continued its operations in Norway under the direction of the Nazis until the war was over and the London board stepped down. A commission of inquiry after the war concluded that the bank&#x27;s Oslo management had taken a firm and correct attitude towards the Nazi authorities. In 1962, the Mint Supervisory Authority and the Royal Mint were transferred from the state to Norges Bank.

<doc id="1256961" wikidata="Q3764168" url="?curid=1256961" title="Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah Wali">
<text>Ibrahim Qutb Shah Wali (1518 – 5 June 1580), also known by his Telugu names Malki BhaRama and Ibharama Chakravarti, was the fourth monarch of the kingdom of Golconda in southern India. He was the first of the Qutb Shahi dynasty to use the title &quot;Sultan&quot;. He ruled from 1550 to 1580. He lived for seven years in exile at the court of Vijayanagara as an honoured guest of Rama Raya. Ibrahim is known for patronizing Telugu extensively because he was moved by a genuine love for the language.

==Early life==
Ibrahim was born the son of Quli Qutb Mulk, founder of the Qutb Shahi dynasty of Golkonda. His father, an ethnic Turkmen, had emigrated to India with his family as a young man and taken employment in the court of the Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan. He had risen steadily in the army and, when the Bahamani sultanate had splintered and collapsed, he had carved out a sizable principality for himself by force of arms. Ibrahim was one of his younger sons. 

==Exile==
In 1543, after achieving so much and living such an extraordinary life, Quli Qutb Mulk was killed by his own younger son, Jamsheed, while he was offering his prayers one day. The assassin, who was Ibrahim&#x27;s brother, made every effort to capture, kill, or mutilate all his brothers. He managed to capture and blind his eldest brother, crown prince Qutbuddin, but Ibrahim somehow managed to escape. He fled Golconda and took refuge in the court of the powerful Hindu ruler of Vijayanagara. Here he lived in exile as an honored guest of the powerful patriarch of Vijayanagara, Rama Raya. He lived at the Vijayanagara court for seven years (1543–50). When Jamsheed died due to Cancer on 22 January 1550, there was internal chaos within the kingdom. His son Subhan who was only an infant, was placed on the throne by Mustapha Khan. Jagadev Rao, Chief of the Naikwari, tried to place Jamsheed&#x27;s brother Daulat Quli, who instead wanted Ibrahim to be the king, on the throne. This led to his imprisonment in Bala Hisar, the highest point of the Golkonda fort. Some discontented elements within the kingdom summoned Ibrahim to end his exile and claim the throne for himself.

During his sojourn in Vijayanagara, Ibrahim developed very close and loving ties with the imperial family and with important members of the nobility. He also became deeply influenced by Hindu, Telugu culture. He adopted Hindu/Telugu ways of dress, food, etiquette, and above all, speech. He developed a strong love for the Telugu language, which he patronized and encouraged throughout his reign. Indeed, he even went so far as to adopt a new name for himself, &quot;Malki BhaRama,&quot; which is his own name spoken with a strong, rustic Telugu accent. He used this name for himself in various official letters and documents and it therefore gained official recognition. According to a court poet, Ibrahim would sit, &quot;floating on waves of bliss,&quot; while listening to the Mahabharata being recited in Telugu rather than Sanskrit. It is said that the court of Ibrahim Qutb Shah had many scholars learned in the Vedas, Sastras, and Puranas.

==Reign==
Such favourable attitudes to Hindus had an effect. Ibrahim during his early reign got support from Telugu noblemen. In 1550 when Ibrahim was returning to Golconda, two envoys were sent to the sultan from the fort of Koilkonda pledging allegiance to him. He was crowned on 27 July 1550, upon returning to Golconda. According to the long inscription at the fort, the Hindus pledged allegiance to him, and anyone who &#x27;dealt with any other person other than Ibrahim&#x27; would be considered being of low birth and would incur the sin of having killed cows and Brāhmaṇas at Varanasi.

In Vijayanagara, Ibrahim married Bagiradhi (correctly: &quot;Bhagirathi&quot;), a Hindu woman, according to Hindu rites and customs. Bagiradhi was also known as &quot;Kaavya kanyaka&quot; and she came from a family with a legacy in music and dance rooted in Hindu, and south Indian traditions. The son born to Ibrahim and Bhagirathi, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, would succeed his father to become the 5th ruler of the dynasty.

Ibrahim employed Hindus for administrative, diplomatic, and military purposes within his sultanate. A patron of the arts and of Telugu literature, Ibrahim sponsored many court poets, such as Singanacharyudu, Addanki Gangadharudu, Ponnanganti Telenganaraya, and Kandukuru Rudrakavi. There were Telugu poets, in a break from tradition. He also patronized Arabic and Persian poets in his court. He is also known in Telugu literature as Malki Bharama (his adopted Hindu name). Ibrahim repaired and fortified Golconda Fort and developed the Hussain Sagar lake and Ibrahim Bagh. He is described in one of the inscriptions on the &quot;Makki Darwaza&quot; in the fort as &quot;The Greatest of Sovereigns&quot;.

In 1565, Ibrahim took advantage of internal conflicts in Vijayanagara, which had given him shelter in exile during 1543–1550. He became part of a cabal of Muslim rulers of small states which banded together to destroy the powerful Hindu kingdom of Vijayanagara. He thus personally betrayed Rama Raya of Vijayanagara, who had given him shelter during his exile from 1543 to 1550. In the Battle of Talikota which ensued, Rama Raya was killed and the city where Ibrahim had spent seven happy and safe years was razed to the ground; the remnants of its former glory can be seen in the lfixl of Hampi today. Following the battle of Talikota in 1565, Ibrahim was able to expand his own kingdom by taking the important hill forts of Adoni and Udayagiri, which commanded an extensive territory and which had been prized possessions of his former host.

==Death==
After a short illness, Ibrahim died on 5 June 1580. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, who was born to his Hindu wife Bhagirathi.

<text>A 4-4-4-4 steam locomotive, in the Whyte notation for describing locomotive wheel arrangements, has a four-wheel leading truck, two sets of four driving wheels, and a four-wheel trailing truck. While it would be possible to make an articulated locomotive of this arrangement, the only 4-4-4-4s ever built were duplex locomotives—with two sets of cylinders driving two sets of driven wheels in one rigid frame, essentially a 4-8-4 with divided drive.

==History==
===20th century===
The first locomotive built with this arrangement was the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s sole class N-1 #5600 &quot;George H. Emerson&quot;, constructed at the B&amp;O&#x27;s own Mount Clare Shops in May 1937. To reduce the fixed wheelbase, this locomotive had the two sets of cylinders at opposite ends, so that the rear pair were beside the firebox. The firebox was an unconventional water tube design which was tested well on other locomotives and needed a large space. The 4-4-4-4 wheel arrangement proved to be a poor design, as it restricted the firebox size and exposed the cylinders to dust and dirt, causing premature wear. The locomotive was not considered successful enough to duplicate. The sole N-1 was retired in 1943 and scrapped in 1950.

The next locomotives to use the 4-4-4-4 arrangement were the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s 52 class T1 locomotives (although the single class S1 was originally intended to be a 4-4-4-4, it was later changed to 6-4-4-6 due to increased weight). These had the cylinders in front of the wheels they drove, so that the rear pair were between the two sets of drivers. These locomotives were impressive performers but suffered from wheelslip and severe reliability problems, and did not last long in service. 

The two prototypes, #6110 and #6111, were constructed at the Baldwin Locomotive Works in April 1942. The mechanical design work had been undertaken by Baldwin&#x27;s chief engineer Ralph P. Johnson, while the streamlining was the handiwork of industrial designer Raymond Loewy. Both locomotives showed fantastic performance in test trials, leading to the construction of 50 further examples. Numbers 5500 through 5524 would be constructed at the PRR&#x27;s Altoona Works while 5525 through 5549 would be constructed at Baldwin. 

As operation continued, problems arose. The T1 class was known for violent uncontrollable wheel slip as well as performance and maintenance issues caused by the Franklin oscillating-cam Poppet valves. The PRR did show interest in trying to solve these problems such as replacing the original poppets on #5500 with easier to maintain Franklin rotary-cam poppet valves and refitting #5547 with Walschaerts valve gears reclassifying the latter engine as a &quot;T1a&quot;.

The PRR decided to stop development of the T1 class, replacing all examples by the mid-1950s with diesel units. All members of the class were scrapped. It is very likely the T1 may have had many of its shortcomings solved had the PRR not retired the short-lived class so soon. During its short service life, the T1 was rumored to have operated at higher speeds than the steam speed record set by the London and North Eastern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Mallard&quot;, but the claims could not be officially verified.

Several bush tramway engine types were built with this wheel arrangement. These were known as &quot;16-Wheelers&quot;. Two notable New Zealand-based builders were J. Johnson and Sons Ltd. in Invercargill and A &amp; G Price in Thames.

===21st century===
Only one locomotive of the 4-4-4-4 arrangement is being constructed. When finished, PRR 5550 will be the 53rd and only surviving example of the PRR T1 class rather than a replica. The new build T1 is expected to implement some design improvements to help aid in solving problems encountered by the original 52. The estimated date of project completion is currently set to be around 2030. As of November 2023, the project is 43.3% complete with an estimated total cost of US $7,000,000.

<text>Frederick Fennell (July 2, 1914 – December 7, 2004) was an American conductor and one of the primary figures who promoted the Eastman Wind Ensemble as a performing group. He was also influential as a band pedagogue, and greatly affected the field of music education in the US and abroad. In Fennell&#x27;s New York Times obituary, colleague Jerry F. Junkin was quoted as saying &quot;He was arguably the most famous band conductor since John Philip Sousa.&quot;

==Early life==
Fennell was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He chose piccolo as his primary instrument at the age of seven, as drummer in the fife-and-drum corps at the family&#x27;s encampment called Camp Zeke. He owned his first drum set at age ten. In the John Adams High School orchestra, Fennell performed as the kettledrummer and served as the band&#x27;s drum major.

His studies at the Interlochen Arts Camp (then the National Music Camp) included being chosen by famed bandmaster Albert Austin Harding as the bass drummer in the National High School Band in 1931. The band was conducted by John Philip Sousa on July 26, the program including the premiere of Sousa&#x27;s Northern Pines march. Fennell himself conducted at Interlochen at the age of seventeen. 

Fennell formed a compatible and fruitful relationship with the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. As a student, he organized the first University of Rochester marching band for the football team and held indoor concerts with the band after the football season for ten years. At Eastman, he completed his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees (in 1937 and 1939). Fennell became the first person to whom the Eastman School of Music awarded a degree in percussion performance. He was also awarded a fellowship that allowed him to study at the Mozarteum Salzburg in 1938, where he took several courses with Herbert Albert and visited several times with the festival&#x27;s chief conductor, the renowned Wilhelm Furtwängler. Returning, he sailed on the from Southampton on September 3, 1938. For the purpose of the passenger manifest, he signed his name as Frederick Putnam Fennell (a rare use of his middle name). 

Fennell also studied conducting with Serge Koussevitzky at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood in 1942 (with classmates Leonard Bernstein, Lukas Foss and Walter Hendl). He was appointed Koussevitzky&#x27;s assistant at the Center in 1948. In 1944, a California newspaper pictured Fennell examining donated musical instruments for WWII servicemen; he was described as the &quot;national USO (United Service Organizations) musical advisor for San Diego County.&quot;

==Eastman Wind Ensemble==

While Fennell was recuperating from hepatitis for six weeks in 1952, the idea for a new, smaller type of symphonic band occurred to him: scaling the typical concert band down to the size of the wind section of a symphony orchestra, allowing for greater clarity and better intonation. He recruited nearly 40 players in May 1952 for this, explaining, “I chose the best students in the school, the best solo performers and the best ensemble players.&quot; On September 20, 1952, he conducted the first rehearsal for this new Eastman Wind Ensemble, and its first concert at Eastman&#x27;s Kilbourn Hall on February 8, 1953. Desiring expanded repertoire, he wrote to nearly 400 composers around the world commissioning appropriate compositions for the new group. The first three composers to respond were Percy Grainger, Vincent Persichetti and Ralph Vaughan Williams. 

==Fennell&#x27;s recordings==

Conducting the Eastman Wind Ensemble, the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra and various other groups, Fennell recorded many of the standards of the wind band repertoire. He became one of America&#x27;s most-recorded conductors. Starting with &quot;American Concert Band Masterpieces&quot; in 1953, Fennell recorded over 300 compositions on 29 albums for Mercury Records with the Eastman-Rochester &quot;Pops&quot;, London &quot;Pops&quot; (actually the London Symphony Orchestra in shirt-sleeves), and free-lance groups of New York musicians. However, best known are the 22 of the 29 Mercury releases made with Fennell&#x27;s own Eastman Wind Ensemble. One of these albums, &quot;Lincolnshire Posy,&quot; with music by Percy Grainger (recorded in 1958), was selected by Stereo Review magazine as one of the &quot;50 best recordings of the Centenary of the Phonograph 1877-1977&quot;. The two-volume &quot;Civil War-Its Music and Its Sounds&quot;, recorded in December 1960, was a notable set also made with the Eastman Wind Ensemble, this time performing on period or original instruments. In 1961, Fennell received a citation and a medal from the Congressional Committee for the Centennial of the Civil War for this album. In 2003, the 1958 Mercury album &quot;Winds in Hi-Fi&quot; was chosen by the National Recording Preservation Board for the National Recording Registry. 

Nearly all of Fennell&#x27;s Mercury recordings were reissued on compact disc. Fennell and the Eastman Wind Ensemble were also featured in the premiere issuance of Mercury material on compact disc. In 1986, 24 Sousa marches performed by the Eastman Wind Ensemble were transferred to compact disc by Philips Records, which now owned the Mercury catalog.

Fennell made the first symphonic digital recording in the United States for Telarc with the Cleveland Symphonic Winds, on April 4–5, 1978. The recording included the two Suites for Military Band by Gustav Holst. With the Dallas Wind Symphony, Fennell recorded five programs of music by Nelhybel, Albeniz, Grainger, Bernstein and more, for Reference Recordings. Fennell also recorded for Brain, Columbia Records, Delos, King, Kosei, Ludwig, Premier Recordings, and Sine Qua Non Superba not to mention the Library of Congress label. 

==Career After Eastman==

Fennell was associate music director of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra (later renamed the Minnesota Orchestra) from 1962 to 1964. In September 1965 he became conductor-in-residence at the University of Miami, where he conducted its symphony orchestra and also founded a wind ensemble. He also served as the resident conductor of the Miami Philharmonic from 1974 to 1975, and as principal guest conductor of the Interlochen Arts Academy and Dallas Wind Symphony. At the invitation of its players, he was appointed the initial conductor of the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra in 1984.

On the podium, he evinced a courtly yet commanding manner despite his diminutive (5&#x27;1&quot;) stature. He was known to take charge of a room with words alone, and his conducting was extremely animated. His conducting workshops were famous for including calisthenics and baton-technique exercises in swimming pools. He remained highly active in the world of conducting until a few months before his death at the age of ninety at his home in Siesta Key, Florida. At the time, he was conductor laureate of the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra; principal guest conductor of the Dallas Wind Symphony; and professor emeritus at the University of Miami Frost School of Music.

==Awards and honors==

Fennell received Columbia University&#x27;s Alice M. Ditson Conductor&#x27;s Award in 1969, was presented the Star of the Order from the John Philip Sousa Memorial Foundation in 1985, received an honorary doctorate from Eastman in 1988, and was inducted into the National Band Association Hall of Fame of Distinguished Band Conductors in 1990. He received the Theodore Thomas Award of the Conductor&#x27;s Guild in 1994. He was also inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2003, he received the Charles E. Lutton Man of Music Award from Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia at its national convention in Washington, DC.

Fennell was said to be most fond of the honorary doctorate he was awarded from Eastman, being inducted as an honorary chief of the Kiowa Nation in the 1960s, and receiving a medal of honor from Interlochen in 1989. He made frequent appearances guest conducting such ensembles as the Boston Pops Orchestra 1949 to 1978, Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, the United States Marine Band, Interlochen Arts Academy, and the Interlochen Arts Camp. In 1997, he became the first civilian to conduct an entire concert with the United States Marine Band; and in July 1998 he repeated this at a concert in the Kennedy Center celebrating the 200th anniversary of the Marine Band.

Fennell was a brother of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music (initiated into the Fraternity&#x27;s Alpha Nu Chapter at the Eastman School of Music in 1934), and Kappa Kappa Psi, the National Honorary Band Fraternity.

Frederick Fennell Hall was dedicated in Kofu, Japan on July 17, 1992. On April 4, 2006, the Interlochen Center for the Arts opened up state of the art music and academic libraries, with the music library named in honor and memory of Fennell and his wife, Elizabeth Ludwig Fennell.

Fennell died in Siesta Key, Florida. His daughter, Catherine Fennell Martensen, stated that on his deathbed Fennell had said, &quot;I cannot die without a drummer.&quot; She added that his last words were: &quot;I hear him. I&#x27;m O.K. now.&quot;

==Fennell&#x27;s writings==

Fennell wrote several books: &quot;Time and the Winds, a Short History of the Use of Wind Instruments in the Orchestra, Band and the Wind Ensemble&quot;, 1954; &quot;The Drummer’s Heritage, a Collection of Popular Airs and Official U.S. Army Music for Fifes and Drums&quot;, 1956; and &quot;The Wind Ensemble&quot;, 1988. Fennell was commissioned by Grenadilla Music to write a major article on 20th Century band composers and their music. The article was published in volume one of &quot;Panorama of 20th Century Classical Music&quot; subtitled, &quot;BAND! (Wind Ensembles, Brass &amp; Concert Bands&quot; and is currently available at www.grenadillamusic.com.

He also edited for several music publishers: Boosey &amp; Hawkes, Carl Fischer, Theodore Presser, and Sam Fox. For the Fennell Editions at Ludwig Music he edited over 50 scores for band performance, including many marches. One of these editions published in 1981 was for his favorite march, National Emblem by Edwin Eugene Bagley. He also wrote a series of sixteen articles published in &quot;The Instrumentalist&quot; under the heading ‘Basic Band Repertory’ beginning in April 1975 and concluding in February 1984. These articles were devoted to what Fennell called &quot;...indestructible masterpieces for band that have survived the ravages of time and many an inept conductor&quot;.

Fennell wrote an original march in 1951, &quot;Tally-Ho March,&quot; in honor of the Tally-Ho Music Camp and its founders, Fred and Dorotha Bradley.

In 1937, Fred Fennel married Dorothy Codner, a violinist he met at Eastman School of Music. They remained happily married for thirty three years.

<text>Homeorhesis, derived from the Greek for &quot;similar flow&quot;, is a concept encompassing dynamical systems which return to a trajectory, as opposed to systems which return to a particular state, which is termed homeostasis.

==Biology==
Homeorhesis is steady flow. Often biological systems are inaccurately described as homeostatic, being in a steady state. Steady state implies equilibrium which is never reached, nor are organisms and ecosystems in a closed environment. During his tenure at the State University of New York at Oneonta, Dr William Butts correctly applied the term homeorhesis to biological organisms. The term was created by C.H. Waddington and first used in biology in his book Strategy of the Genes (1957), where he described the tendency of developing or changing organisms to continue development or adapting to their environment and changing towards a given state.

==Gaia hypothesis==
In ecology the concept is important as an element of the Gaia hypothesis, where the system under consideration is the ecological balance of different forms of life on the planet. James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, coauthors of Gaia hypothesis, wrote in particular that only homeorhetic, and not homeostatic, balances are involved in the theory. That is, the composition of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere are regulated around &quot;set points&quot; as in homeostasis, but those set points change with time.

<text>The CSS &quot;Beaufort ( ) was an iron-hull [[gunboat]] that served in [[North Carolina]] and [[Virginia]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Originally [[ceremonial ship launching|launched]] as Caledonia&quot; at Wilmington, Delaware, in 1854, the ship was owned by James Cathcart Johnston. It saw use as a tugboat on the Dismal Swamp Canal. On July 9, 1861, &quot;Beaufort&quot; was commissioned into the navy of the state of North Carolina for use in the American Civil War. First serving on the North Carolina coast, &quot;Beaufort&quot; was present at the battles of Roanoke Island and Elizabeth City in February 1862. Escaping the Confederate defeat at Elizabeth City via the Dismal Swamp Canal, &quot;Beaufort&quot; reached Norfolk, Virginia, where she joined the James River Squadron.

On March 8, 1862, &quot;Beaufort&quot; served as an escort and ship&#x27;s tender for the ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; at the Battle of Hampton Roads. In April, she supported the Confederate defense of Yorktown, Virginia, before the Confederates withdrew up the Virginia Peninsula. Before the Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff in mid-May 1862, &quot;Beaufort&quot; was ordered upriver and was mostly inactive until mid-1864. With Union troops having moved upriver, &quot;Beaufort&quot; saw some action, including bombarding the Fort Harrison area after Union troops had captured it. However, the ship was hampered with an understrength crew, as much of her crew had been transferred to North Carolina or to land fortifications along the James River. In January 1865, &quot;Beaufort&quot; was part of the Confederate advance before the Battle of Trent&#x27;s Reach, but ended up spending hours trying to free the ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia II&quot; after the latter had run aground. On the night of April 2/3, after the fall of Richmond, Virginia, the Confederates scuttled the ships of the James River Squadron, but &quot;Beaufort&quot; failed to sink. Captured by Union forces, &quot;Beaufort&quot; was sold in September 1865. As a civilian merchant vessel, she was renamed &quot;Roanoke&quot; and was converted into a barge in 1878.

==Construction and early history==
Originally known as &quot;Caledonia&quot;, &quot;Beaufort&quot; was launched at Wilmington, Delaware, in 1854. Constructed by Pusey &amp; Jones, &quot;Caledonia&quot; had been built for James Cathcart Johnston, who named it after his plantation, although the ship as constructed was found to draw too deep of a draft to navigate to the plantation. &quot;Caledonia&quot; was originally based out of Edenton, North Carolina. Later used as a tugboat on the Dismal Swamp Canal, the vessel had a tonnage of 85 tons, a length of , a beam of , and a depth of hold of . An iron-hulled screw steamer, power was provided by a single vertical direct acting steam engine.

Early in the American Civil War, the coastline of North Carolina was recognized as being of strategic importance, and a state Military and Navy Board was created. Part of the state&#x27;s defenses was the North Carolina Navy (informally known as the Mosquito Fleet). One of the Mosquito Fleet&#x27;s vessels was &quot;Beaufort&quot;. The &quot;Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&quot; states that &quot;Beaufort&quot; was commissioned for military service on July 9, 1861, by Lieutenant R. C. Duvall, while at Norfolk, Virginia, before then traveling to New Bern, North Carolina. The &quot;Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies&quot; reports that &quot;Beaufort&quot; was purchased at New Bern. In order to allow her to mount a cannon, the vessel&#x27;s structure was strengthened with wooden beams. &quot;Beaufort&quot; was armed with a 32-pounder rifled cannon, and her magazine and boiler were located in a position where they would be endangered during naval combat. She was manned by a crew of 35. The crews of the ships of the North Carolina Navy were generally inexperienced in naval matters and were barely trained for the service they performed, ammunition was often faulty, and the cannons the ships were armed with had a tendency to explode.

==Confederate service==
===North Carolina===

&quot;Beaufort&quot; took part in the first ship-versus-ship action of the American Civil War on July 20, when it fought USS &quot;Albatross&quot; near Oregon Inlet. &quot;Albatross&quot; was a much larger vessel than &quot;Beaufort&quot;, but both ships spent the 45-minute battle firing from behind the cover of either side of a barrier island. At this time, &quot;Beaufort&quot; was still under the command of Duvall. Later that month, &quot;Beaufort&quot; and the other ships of the North Carolina Navy were transferred into the Confederate States Navy from the North Carolina state forces. Along with fellow Mosquito fleet vessels CSS &quot;Winslow&quot; and CSS &quot;Raleigh&quot;, &quot;Beaufort&quot; engaged in raiding Union merchant shipping along the North Carolina coast, although &quot;Winslow&quot; had the most success. Confederate Lieutenant William Harwar Parker took command of &quot;Beaufort&quot; on September 9.

By the time of Burnside&#x27;s North Carolina Expedition in February 1862, &quot;Beaufort&quot; was part of the Confederate fleet near Roanoke Island commanded by Commodore William F. Lynch. Confederate land forces had built three forts on the island, and Lynch&#x27;s Mosquito Fleet was present as well, positioned behind a group of blockships sunk between the island and the North Carolina mainland. The Union had an infantry force prepared to land, as well a naval force. Both outnumbered their Confederate counterparts. On February 7, the Battle of Roanoke Island began, with the Union ships firing on the Mosquito Fleet and on the Confederate land defenses. Only one of the forts was in a position where it could return fire. The Mosquito Fleet tried to lure the Union vessels further north into the range of the other two forts, but this was not successful. The Union was able to land infantry on Roanoke Island and overran the island&#x27;s defenders the next day. After the fight at Roanoke Island, Lynch withdrew his ships to Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Parker and most of &quot;Beaufort&quot;″s crew were sent ashore to man a fortification on February 10, the same day that Union ships attacked and brought on the Battle of Elizabeth City. Most of the Mosquito Fleet was destroyed in the fighting, but &quot;Beaufort&quot; was able to escape up the Dismal Swamp Canal to Norfolk.

===Hampton Roads and inactivity===
At Norfolk, &quot;Beaufort&quot; was part of the James River Squadron. Led by the ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, the squadron sallied forth against the vessels of the Union blockade stationed in Hampton Roads on March 8. &quot;Beaufort&quot; and &quot;Raleigh&quot; served as escort vessels for the ironclad. At the mouth of the Elizabeth River on the way to Hampton Roads, &quot;Beaufort&quot; had to user a hawser to assist &quot;Virginia&quot; in turning in shallow water. &quot;Virginia&quot; attacked the blockaders in the Battle of Hampton Roads and after sinking one Union vessel, badly damaged USS &quot;Congress&quot;. &quot;Beaufort&quot; and &quot;Raleigh&quot; moved towards &quot;Congress&quot; to negotiate surrender of the damaged vessel but came under fire from the shore. After an officer from &quot;Virginia&quot; was wounded during another attempt to negotiate the surrender of &quot;Congress&quot;, &quot;Virginia&quot; sank the blockader. &quot;Beaufort&quot; also served as a ship&#x27;s tender for &quot;Virginia&quot; during the battle and fired on other Union ships. The crew of &quot;Beaufort&quot; received the Thanks of Congress from the Confederate States Congress for her role in the battle.

On April 18, &quot;Beaufort&quot; joined &quot;Raleigh&quot; and the gunboats CSS &quot;Teaser&quot;, CSS &quot;Jamestown&quot;, and CSS &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; in supporting the Confederate land forces defending Yorktown, Virginia. The Confederates retreated from the Virginia Peninsula, and fell back to close to Richmond, Virginia, leading to the abandonment of Norfolk and the scuttling of &quot;Virginia&quot;. When Union ships moved up the James River towards Drewry&#x27;s Bluff in May, &quot;Beaufort&quot; and several other Confederate vessels were sent to a safe position upriver while their crews fought from land positions in the Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff on May 15.

The James River Squadron entered into a long period of routine patrolling of a stretch of of the James River downriver from Richmond until 1864, when the region was threatened by Union ships again. Not long after Hampton Roads, Parker was transferred to Charleston, South Carolina. For a period of time in 1862 and 1863, Lieutenant William H. Murdaugh commanded &quot;Beaufort&quot;. Lieutenant William Sharp took command in October 1863, and was replaced by Lieutenant Edward J. Means the next month. Means remained in command until June 1864. A second cannon had been added to &quot;Beaufort&quot;″s armament by November 30, 1863. &quot;Beaufort&quot; remained inactive during the time Means was in command. Union vessels had moved upriver towards the Confederate positions in mid-May, and the James River Squadron&#x27;s new commander, Captain John Kirkwood Mitchell, requested a more experienced officer be assigned to command &quot;Beaufort&quot; in anticipation of action. Lieutenant J. M. Gardner then took command in June.

===End of war===

On September 29, Union infantry won the Battle of Fort Harrison, and captured Fort Harrison itself, a Confederate defensive position. In response, &quot;Beaufort&quot;, along with several other Confederate vessels, bombarded Union troops in the area of the fort from September 29 through October 1. The Confederate fire was effective, and Union return fire did little damage. A number of men from &quot;Beaufort&quot; were also transferred to man land fortifications. Other members of the ship&#x27;s crew had been transferred to North Carolina in July, and as a result &quot;Beaufort&quot; could only provide minimal service due to a shortage of crew members. Some Confederate sailors were released in prisoner exchanges in October, which allowed the vessel to regain some crew strength. November saw &quot;Beaufort&quot;″s armament reduced to a single 32-pounder cannon. Lieutenant William Pinckney Mason took command of &quot;Beaufort&quot; in October, and Lieutenant Joseph W. Alexander took over on December 19. In January 1865, Mitchell decided to sally forth and attack the Union ships in the James River, as many Union ships had been transferred to North Carolina for the operations against Confederate-held Fort Fisher.

On the evening of January 23, the Confederate ships began their movements downriver, starting the Battle of Trent&#x27;s Reach. As the navigable channel of the river was narrow, the wooden Confederate ships were either lashed to one of the three ironclads in the James River Squadron, or were towed behind another ship. &quot;Beaufort&quot; and the tender CSS &quot;Drewry&quot; were lashed to the ironclad CSS &quot;Richmond&quot;, with &quot;Drewry&quot; towing the torpedo boat CSS &quot;Wasp&quot;. When the ironclad CSS &quot;Virginia II&quot; ran aground, &quot;Drewry&quot; and &quot;Beaufort&quot; were released to go to her aid. When efforts to free &quot;Virginia II&quot; failed. &quot;Drewry&quot; later moved downstream, but &quot;Beaufort&quot; and the gunboat CSS &quot;Nansemond&quot; spent three hours trying to free the ironclad. Before dawn, the Confederate vessels who had not run aground withdrew upriver, but &quot;Drewry&quot;, &quot;Richmond&quot;, &quot;Virginia II&quot;, and the torpedo boat CSS &quot;Scorpion&quot; had all grounded within range of Union guns. While the two ironclads were eventually able to get free and escape, &quot;Drewry&quot; blew up after being struck by Union fire, and the explosion forced &quot;Scorpion&quot; downriver, where she was captured.

Command of &quot;Beaufort&quot; passed to George Henry Arledge on February 12. Mitchell was relieved of command on February 18 and replaced by Rear Admiral Raphael Semmes. Mitchell left Semmes a description of the condition of the James River Squadron vessels, which noted that &quot;Beaufort&quot; was &quot;not servicable, except in emergencies&quot; and that she had problems were her propeller and rudder. The Confederates abandoned Richmond on April 2, and the James River Squadron was scuttled. The ironclads were destroyed at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, while the wooden ships went upriver to Richmond to be burned on the night of April 2/3. The fire set on &quot;Beaufort&quot; did not sink her, and the ship was captured by Union troops. She was operated by the Union until September 15, when she was sold. &quot;Beaufort&quot; was then used as a civilian merchant vessel, and was renamed &quot;Roanoke&quot; in October. In 1878 she was converted into a barge.

<doc id="1256986" wikidata="Q7081182" url="?curid=1256986" title="Oi Aparadektoi">
<text>Oi Aparadektoi (, ) is a comedy television series broadcast by Mega Channel from September 1991 to January 1993. The series is considered one of the most successful on Greek television, representative of the daily life of Athenians in the early 1990s.

==Premise==
The show is about the lives of four friends, the eponymous &quot;Aparadektoi&quot;: Spyros (&quot;Spyros Papadopoulos&quot;), Dimitra (&quot;Dimitra Papadopoulou&quot;, who is also the script writer), Yannis (&quot;Yannis Bezos&quot;) and Vlassis (&quot;Vlassis Bonatsos&quot;). Spyros and Dimitra have been married for five years, while Yannis and Vlassis are roommates and best friends, despite the fact that the former is a homosexual and the latter a shameless womanizer. All four live on the same floor of an apartment building in Lycabettus, Athens, Greece, in two apartments that share the same terrace. The cast is rounded out by Renia (&quot;Renia Louizidou&quot;), Vlassis&#x27; girlfriend, and Mr. Vassilis (&quot;Vassilis Halakatevakis&quot;), the landlord.

The show&#x27;s episodes are self-contained - even if hell may have broken loose by the end of an episode (e.g. Dimitra declaring that she will divorce Spyros), the next episode will find everything back to normal. The show is also notable for the unconventional friendship between the characters; even though they describe themselves as friends, the four frequently quarrel, casually badmouth and plot against each other; Spyros and Vlassis often plan to cheat on Dimitra and Renia and vice versa; and so on.

Spyros Papadopoulos and Yannis Bezos are widely considered to be among the finest Greek actors of their generation, Dimitra Papadopoulou is one of the most successful female comedians and script writers, and the intro theme was composed/sampled by renowned electronica musician Nikko Patrelakis. Also, Vlassis Bonatsos was a highly successful comedian, singer and TV personality, who died a few years after the show, in 2004.

In 2009, MEGA Channel asked Dimitra Papadopoulou to write the script for a new season of episodes, however she rejected the proposal due to the death of the fourth actor (Vlassis). As she explained later, she was shattered by the death of Vlassis Bonatsos, and being loyal to her friend&#x27;s memory she would never replace his role with another actor.

==Characters==

===Spyros===
Spyros is an advertising producer. Despite a glorious - according to him - past in the Communist Party of Greece and his participation in the Athens Polytechnic uprising against the Greek military junta of 1967-1974 from November 14 to November 17, 1973, Spyros today is no better than the capitalists he views with disdain. He is obsessed with making and saving money and thus absorbed in his work, while maintaining the theoretical views of a communist. He is short tempered and supposedly the most level headed of the quartet, which makes him often exclaim his catchphrase &quot;Ti egine re paidia?&quot; (approx. &quot;What on earth happened, you guys?&quot;) while looking at the camera in perplexed demeanour when crazy situations arise.

===Dimitra===
Dimitra is Spyros&#x27; disgruntled wife. Spyros&#x27; devotion to his job leave her feeling neglected, leading her in numerous fruitless attempts to arouse her husband&#x27;s interest in her. She is not as refined as Spyros thinks himself to be, which is often a cause of friction between them. She is insanely jealous of Spyros, often with good reason and she has threatened to divorce him many times during the show&#x27;s run.

===Yannis===
Yannis is a fashion designer. He is also a homosexual, a fact that all his friends know and accept. He has a neurotic personality and elitist attitude. This is because he knows he is often the shrewdest one in the gang, but also because being a homosexual in the early 1990s Greece made forming and having an according relationship tricky, a source of much stress for Yannis. His only surviving family, his Aunt Virginia, is in the dark about her nephew&#x27;s sexuality.

===Vlassis===
Vlassis works as the main actor in Spyros&#x27; commercials. He is also Yannis&#x27; best friend and roommate ever since one of his girlfriends broke up with him. Vlassis is laid back and easy going - he enjoys the earthly pleasures of life, like food, drink and especially women.

===Renia===
Renia works as an advertising model and secretary in Spyros&#x27; firm. She is also Vlassis&#x27; girlfriend, a pretty shaky term considering Vlassis&#x27; flirtatious nature. Renia is young and modern and often introduces new notions for the others to try. Yannis views Renia with disdain, nicknaming her &quot;To astropeleki&quot; (&quot;The thunderbolt&quot;) due to her unpredictably energetic attitude and inane comments.

===Mr. Vassilis===
Mr. Vassilis is the landlord of the apartments Spyros, Dimitra, Yannis and Vlassis live in. He tries to have friendly relationships with his tenants but something always puts a crimp in these attempts, such as him demanding overdue rent or being decidedly uncool. He is often the harbinger of bad news to the rest of the gang.

==Reruns==
After the show ended its run in January 1993, Mega Channel reran it a multitude of times over the next few years, together with other much-loved series, like Oi Treis Harites. The show ended up being reran in the 1990s more times than any other on Greek television (more than 12 reruns within 5 years). Eventually, a tired television audience and sarcastic TV magazine reviews forced the show off the air after the summer of 1997.

In 2004, Mega Channel reran a small number of episodes as part of its 15-year anniversary. After 7 years of absence, this revisit was welcomed by the public. Mega Channel then started rerunning &quot;Oi Aparadektoi&quot; again on a weekly basis in a prime time slot (Friday 21:00) for a few months.</text><links>

<doc id="1256990" wikidata="Q1033108" url="?curid=1256990" title="Candyman (1992 film)">
<text>Candyman is a 1992 American gothic supernatural black horror film, written and directed by Bernard Rose and starring Virginia Madsen, Tony Todd, Xander Berkeley, Kasi Lemmons, and Vanessa E. Williams. Based on Clive Barker&#x27;s short story &quot;The Forbidden&quot;, the film follows a Chicago graduate student completing a thesis on urban legends and folklore, which leads her to the legend of the &quot;Candyman&quot;, the ghost of an African-American artist and son of a slave who was murdered in the late 19th century for his relationship with the daughter of a wealthy white man.

The film came to fruition after a chance meeting between Rose and Barker who later completed his own film adaptation of &quot;Nightbreed&quot; (1990). Rose expressed interest in Barker&#x27;s story &quot;The Forbidden&quot;, and Barker agreed to license the rights. Where Barker&#x27;s story revolved around the themes of the British class system in contemporary Liverpool, Rose chose to refit the story to Cabrini-Green&#x27;s public housing development in Chicago and instead focus on the themes of race and social class in the inner-city United States.

&quot;Candyman&quot; premiered at the 1992 Toronto International Film Festival, and was theatrically released on October 16, 1992, by TriStar Pictures and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. It received generally positive reviews and grossed over $25 million in the US, where it was also regarded in some critical circles as a contemporary classic of horror cinema. It was followed by three sequels: &quot;&quot; (1995), &quot;Candyman 3: Day of the Dead&quot; (1999), and &quot;Candyman&quot; (2021) which the latter serves as a direct-sequel to the original.

==Plot==
Helen Lyle is a semiotics graduate student at the University of Illinois Chicago. While researching urban legends, she familiarizes herself with Candyman, a spirit who kills anyone that speaks his name five times before a mirror. She learns of a recent murder at the Cabrini–Green Homes public housing project and several others that have been attributed by locals to Candyman. Skeptical, Helen and her friend Bernadette Walsh repeat Candyman&#x27;s name to Helen&#x27;s bathroom mirror, to no avail.

Helen and Bernadette work together on a thesis on how Cabrini-Green residents use the Candyman legend to cope with racial inequality. She and Bernadette visit the scene of the most recent murder. There, Helen discovers a room where sweets have been left for Candyman. Afterwards, they interview the victim&#x27;s neighbor, Anne-Marie McCoy, a single mother raising her infant son Anthony. Helen and her husband Trevor, alongside Bernadette, later have dinner with Professor Phillip Purcell, an expert on the Candyman myth. He discloses that &quot;Candyman&quot; was Daniel Robitaille, an African-American man born in the late 1800s as the son of a slave who grew up to become a renowned painter. After he fell in love with and impregnated a white woman, her father sent a lynch mob after him. The mob sawed off his right hand and smeared him with honeycomb stolen from an apiary, attracting bees that stung him to death. His corpse was burned in a pyre erected on the site where the Cabrini-Green Homes were eventually built.

When Helen returns to Cabrini-Green, a young boy named Jake tells her of an incident where a developmentally disabled boy was castrated by Candyman in a public bathroom. Helen investigates the site, where a man claiming to be Candyman batters her with a hook. She identifies her attacker to the police, who recognize him as the head of a local gang, and he&#x27;s therefore charged for the murders attributed to Candyman. A few days later, however, the real Candyman appears to Helen in a parking garage, hypnotizing her. He explains that due to her discredit of his legend, he must shed innocent blood to perpetuate it. Helen blacks out and awakens in Anne-Marie&#x27;s apartment, covered in blood, finding Anne-Marie&#x27;s pet Rottweiler, Annie, decapitated and her son Anthony missing. Anne-Marie proceeds to attack Helen, who stabs Anne-Marie during their struggle. The police arrive and arrest Helen.

After Trevor bails her out of jail, Helen spots Candyman in a photograph she took at Cabrini-Green. He breaks into Helen&#x27;s apartment and cuts her neck, causing her to bleed and pass out. Bernadette arrives at Helen&#x27;s apartment, and when Helen comes to, she realizes that Candyman has murdered Bernadette. Framed for the crime, Helen is committed to a psychiatric hospital. While being interviewed in preparation for her trial a month later, Helen attempts to prove her innocence by summoning Candyman, who appears and murders her psychiatrist. Candyman then frees Helen from her restraints, allowing her to escape.

Helen returns to her apartment to find Trevor now living with one of his students, Stacey. Helen confronts him, then flees to Cabrini-Green to rescue Anthony. When she finds Candyman in his lair, he informs Helen that her surrender to him will ensure Anthony&#x27;s safety. Offering Helen immortality, Candyman opens his coat, revealing a ribcage wreathed in bees. The bees pour out of his mouth and stream down her throat as he kisses her. He vanishes with Anthony, and Helen awakes to discover a mural of the Candyman and his lover, who bears a striking resemblance to her.

Candyman promises to release Anthony if Helen helps him strike fear into Cabrini-Green&#x27;s residents. Attempting to feed his legend, Candyman reneges and attempts to immolate both Helen and Anthony in a pyre. Helen stabs Candyman with a flaming plank. The flames destroy Candyman and Helen dies while rescuing Anthony. The residents, led by Anne-Marie and Jake, pay their respects at Helen&#x27;s funeral. At home, the grief-stricken and guilt-ridden Trevor looks into the mirror and utters Helen&#x27;s name five times, where upon Helen&#x27;s vengeful spirit appears and kills him using Candyman&#x27;s hook, leaving a hysterical Stacey to uncover his body on the bathtub. A new mural of Helen dressed in white with her hair ablaze appears in Candyman&#x27;s lair.

==Cast==
==Production==

Barker&#x27;s short story, set in his native Liverpool, was about segregation and the culture of the poor urban areas. For &quot;Candyman&quot;, Rose was so shocked by Chicago&#x27;s &quot;dynamic&quot; architecture and large amount of prejudice that he decided to change the Liverpool location to Chicago. Assisted by members of the Illinois Film Commission, Rose scouted locations in Chicago and found Cabrini-Green, a housing project notorious for its poor construction, violence and high robbery rates. The project was also located in between high-class neighborhoods, meaning that the character of Helen could feel Cabrini-Green&#x27;s chaos from a safe apartment not too far away. This Americanization of the story turned &quot;Candyman&quot; into an interracial love story where the ghetto residents are now victims of the titular killer. With this change, Rose wanted to showcase those that are living in the poor neighborhoods as regular human beings that are trying to get by which is why he avoided tropes that are common in most American ghetto stories such as gangs and drugs. According to journalist Steve Bogira, one source of inspiration may have been a pair of articles that he wrote for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; in 1987 and 1990 about the murder of Ruthie Mae McCoy, a resident of Chicago&#x27;s Abbot Homes housing project. In 1987, McCoy was killed by an intruder who entered her apartment through an opening behind the bathroom&#x27;s medicine cabinet.

Rose&#x27;s screenplay garnered a huge amount of attention in the casting agencies and Virginia Madsen and Tony Todd instantly tried to get parts to have a chance to work with the filmmaker. Eddie Murphy was the original choice for the role of Candyman, but the filmmakers could not afford him. Todd, who was fit for playing the killer as he was six-foot-five and physically fit, recalled that there was skepticism from his colleagues about him playing the Candyman due to the number of bee sting injuries that he would have to receive. He persisted as he wanted to work with the director and said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to find my own personal Phantom of the Opera.&quot; While the Candyman&#x27;s background is unknown in the original story, Todd came up with the backstory for the character in the film. Virginia Madsen was friends with Rose and his then-wife, Alexandra Pigg and Madsen was originally to play the role of Helen&#x27;s friend, Bernie while Pigg was to play Helen. The choice was made to make the character of Bernie Black American so Madsen lost the part. As the shooting was about to commence, Pigg discovered that she was pregnant so the role of Helen was offered to Madsen. Had Madsen been unable to accept, producer Alan Poul was partial to Sandra Bullock as Helen.

Three days of &quot;Candyman&quot;&#x27;s filming were spent on Cabrini-Green while the other days were spent in scenes on Hollywood sound stages. With plainclothes law enforcement by their side, Todd and Madsen went into the buildings of Cabrini-Green as part of researching their roles which was a useful, but distressing experience for both actors. For playing the Candyman, Todd tried to act as a &quot;primeval boogeyman&quot; without overacting the part which was tricky to do. He worked with Bob Keen on the Candyman&#x27;s look. Keen first had Todd wear a machine-controlled fake right arm, but found the movements of the arm too strict. Then, Keen came up with the idea of having Todd wear a hook to indicate the Candyman&#x27;s supernatural being. He spent three hours making the hook. Todd suggested the character wear an eyepatch, but Keen rejected the idea. To keep the budget low, Rose instructed a special effects manager named Martin Bresson to use traditional effects instead of optical effects. The same team who worked on &quot;Backdraft&quot; also designed the set for the bonfire scene of &quot;Candyman&quot; which involved using 1,500 gallons of propane and its largest section having a 70-foot width and 30-foot height.

The honeybees in &quot;Candyman&quot; were controlled by Norman Gary who previously handled the bees on films such as &quot;The Deadly Bees&quot; (1966), &quot;My Girl&quot; (1991) and &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; (1991). Synthesised queen-bee pheromone was used to calm the bees down. The film used more than 200,000 real honeybees throughout and most of the crew wore bodysuits to be protected from stings, although all of them faced at least one sting. Todd negotiated a bonus of $1,000 for each of the 23 bee stings that he received during filming. In shooting the film&#x27;s climax where the Candyman sends 500 bees into Helen&#x27;s face, he first had the bees placed in his mouth by using a protective mouthpiece to avoid as many stings as possible. Gary had to use freshly hatched, non-stinging and non-flying bees for the scene as Madsen was very allergic to stings. It took half an hour for all of the bees to get into Todd&#x27;s mouth and he recalled being &quot;tranced out&quot; when he let all of the bees out of his mouth. Rose also utilized hypnosis in his movie to work around what he saw as the cliche of excessive screaming in the horror films. Bernard Rose came up with the idea to have Virginia Madsen hypnotized in the scenes where she confronted the Candyman. According to Todd, this process would occur prior to filming the scenes where he and Madsen interacted and would take roughly ten minutes to prepare. This was accomplished through the use of a professional hypnotist who established a key word that Rose would use to put Madsen under a trancelike state.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s score was composed by Philip Glass. According to Glass, &quot;It has become a classic so I still make money from that score, get checks every year.&quot; A compilation of music from the film and from the first sequel was released under the title &quot;The Music of Candyman&quot; as the inaugural release of Glass&#x27;s Orange Mountain Music record company in 2001. A limited edition featuring 7500 copies of the film&#x27;s soundtrack was released in February 2015.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Candyman&quot; had its world premiere at the 1992 Toronto International Film Festival, playing as part of its Midnight Madness line-up. It was released on October 16, 1992, in the United States where it made $25.7 million.

===Home media===
It was released on home video in February 1993 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. A special edition DVD was released in August 2004.

&quot;Candyman&quot; was first released on Blu-ray format in Australia on September 1, 2011, via Universal Studios Home Entertainment.

A standard edition set was released in Germany on July 29, 2016. Several standard Blu-ray editions eventually became available in France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Denmark, Finland and Sweden throughout 2011 and 2012.

On July 20, 2018, it was announced that &quot;Candyman&quot; would be released on Blu-ray in a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; on November 20, 2018, in the United States via Scream Factory, a subsidiary of Shout! Factory. The set contains a newly remastered 2K restoration from a new 4K scan as well as a number of new special features including an unrated cut, commentaries and featurettes. The following week, on July 27, 2018, Arrow Films announced a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; Blu-ray set in the United Kingdom which includes the same scan and special features as the Scream Factory edition. It was confirmed for this edition that the film would contain a new DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track for the first time. The set includes a collector&#x27;s booklet, six lobby cards, a reversible poster and reversible cover artwork. It was released on October 29, 2018.

Arrow issued a limited edition of &quot;Candyman&quot; on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray in the UK on May 23, 2022.

Scream Factory also issued a 4K edition in the United States and Canada on May 24.

===Controversy===
There was some controversy that the film was depicting racism and racial stereotypes. According to Rose, &quot;I had to go and have a whole set of meetings with the NAACP because the producers were so worried and what they said to me when they&#x27;d read the script was &#x27;Why are we even having this meeting? You know, this is just good fun.&#x27; Their argument was &#x27;Why shouldn&#x27;t a black actor be a ghost? Why shouldn&#x27;t a black actor play Freddy Krueger or Hannibal Lecter? If you&#x27;re saying that they can&#x27;t be, it&#x27;s really perverse. This is a horror movie.&#x27;&quot; At the time of the film&#x27;s release, Madsen said, &quot;I was and am now worried about how people will respond. I don&#x27;t think Spike Lee will like this film.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Critical reviews were mixed to positive. &quot;Candyman&quot; scored 79% on Rotten Tomatoes, 61/100 on Metacritic, and a &quot;C+&quot; on CinemaScore.

Among the more positive reviews was Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. He gave the film three stars out of a possible four, and praised the performances of Madsen and Lemmons and the subtle direction by Rose. Ebert wrote: &quot;Elements of the plot may not hold up in the clear light of day, but that didn&#x27;t bother me much. What I liked was a horror movie that was scaring me with ideas and gore, instead of simply with gore.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared it to &quot;an elaborate campfire story&quot; with an &quot;unusually high interest in social issues&quot;, and also highlighted Madsen&#x27;s performance and Glass&#x27;s musical score. Allmovie called it &quot;haunting, intelligent and poetic&quot; and &quot;the finest Barker adaptation ever committed to film&quot;. In a review for Channel 4 &quot;Candyman&quot; has been called &quot;atmospheric and visually stimulating enough to satisfy gore-hounds&quot;, as well as an &quot;intelligent social commentary&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Eric Henderson positively reviewed both the eponymous character and the leading actor: &quot;Played by Tony Todd (and his velvety basso profundo voice), the Candyman is a svelte, sexual monument, far removed from the silent brutality of your average serial slasher.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was more harsh in his review, and called the film Clive Barker&#x27;s &quot;worst to date&quot;—an ambitious, but pretentious film that &quot;quickly becomes as repellent as it is preposterous.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
The film came in at number 75 on Bravo&#x27;s 100 Scariest Movie Moments. The character Candyman came in at number 8 on Bloody Disgusting&#x27;s &quot;The Top 13 Slashers in Horror Movie History&quot; and ranked the same on Ugo&#x27;s &quot;Top Eleven Slashers&quot;. The actor who played Candyman, Tony Todd, made #53 on Retrocrush&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest Horror Movie Performances&quot; for his role.

The film appears in two sections of Filmsite.org&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Scariest Movie Moments and Scenes&quot; and &quot;Greatest Movie Twists, Spoilers and Surprise Endings&quot;. In 2001, the American Film Institute nominated this film for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills. &quot;South Park&quot; parodied this film in the season 10 episode &quot;Hell on Earth 2006&quot;, in which The Notorious B.I.G. appears whenever someone says &quot;Biggie Smalls&quot; three times in a mirror.

==Sequels==
Two stand-alone sequels comprising a single storyline were released in 1995 and 1999 respectively: &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Todd was the only actor to return for both films. Originally, Bernard Rose wanted to make a prequel film about Candyman and Helen&#x27;s love but the studio turned it down.

In September 2018, it was announced that Jordan Peele was in talks to produce a direct sequel to the 1992 film using his company, Monkeypaw Productions. Todd stated in a 2018 interview with Nightmare on Film Street, &quot;I&#x27;d rather have [Peele] do it, someone with intelligence who&#x27;s going to be thoughtful and dig into the whole racial makeup of who &quot;Candyman&quot; is and why he existed in the first place.&quot; In November 2018, it was confirmed that Peele would produce the film with Universal and MGM and will partner with Win Rosenfeld to co-produce the film while Nia DaCosta signed on as director. The film serves as a sequel, taking place back in the new gentrified Cabrini-Green where the old housing projects development once stood in Chicago. Filming was due to commence in spring 2019. In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Todd spoke of Peele, stating: &quot;I know he&#x27;s a fan. I&#x27;m hoping I will appear in the film in some form of fashion. Wouldn&#x27;t that make sense? But, it&#x27;s Hollywood so I won&#x27;t take it personally if for some reason it doesn&#x27;t work out.&quot; He added, &quot;If this new one is successful, it will shed light back on the original. I think the subject matter is more important than any individuals and I mean that.&quot;

In February 2019, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was in talks to play the titular character. In response to the news, Todd said: &quot;Cheers to Candyman, a wonderful character that I&#x27;ve lived with for 25 years. He&#x27;s brought grace and glory and a beautiful boatload of friends &amp; family. I&#x27;m honored that the spirit of Daniel Robitaille &amp; Cabrini-Green rises again. Truth to power! Blessings to the cast &amp; crew&quot;. However, it was ultimately announced that Todd would reprise his role, while Adbul-Mateen would portray the adult version of Anthony McCoy. Teyonah Parris was cast opposite in playing Anthony&#x27;s girlfriend. Other added cast are Colman Domingo and Nathan Stewart-Jarret. Vanessa Estelle Williams would also reprise her role as Anne-Marie, Anthony&#x27;s mother.

Production for the film began in August 2019 and wrapped in September 2019 in Chicago, Illinois. The working title of the film was revealed on some of the cast and crew social media pages as &quot;Say My Name&quot; which was discreetly used in the revised scripts and production sets to keep things &quot;flying under the radar&quot; with the official title also being &quot;Candyman&quot;. The film was released on August 27, 2021.

<doc id="1256991" wikidata="Q545115" url="?curid=1256991" title="Albanians in North Macedonia">
<text>Albanians in North Macedonia (, ) are ethnic Albanians who constitute the second largest ethnic group in North Macedonia, forming 446,245 individuals or 24.3% of the resident population. Of the 2,097,319 total population in the 2021 census (including self-enumerated diaspora), 619,187 or 29.52% are Albanians.

== Geography ==
The Albanian minority is concentrated mostly in the western, north-western and partially middle area of the country with small communities located in the south-west. The largest Albanian communities are in the cities and surrounding regions of Tetovo, Gostivar, Debar, Struga, Kičevo, Kumanovo and Skopje. Smaller numbers are also found in and/or around the cities of Ohrid, Kruševo, Resen, Bitola and Veles. 

===Toponymy===
A number of placenames in North Macedonia have been considered as being ultimately derived through Albanian. Some cases include:
*Štip (&quot;Shtip&quot; in Albanian) is a city in eastern North Macedonia. It was known in antiquity as &quot;Astibo-s&quot;. About the date of settlement of Proto-Albanians in eastern North Macedonia similar arguments as in the case of &quot;Nish&quot; have emerged.
*Ohrid (&quot;Ohër&quot; in Albanian) is a city in southwestern North Macedonia. It has been proposed that the modern name is a modified version of the ancient Greek name, where the transition of &quot;Lychnidus&quot; to &quot;Ohrid&quot;.
*Skopje (&quot;Shkupi&quot; in Albanian) is the capital of North Macedonia. Scupi as it was known in Classical Antiquity.
*Drin is a river in western North Macedonia. It is recorded in Ancient Greek as &quot;Drilon&quot; (Δρίλων) and in Latin as &quot;Drinus&quot;. The form &quot;Drin-&quot; has been evidenced by Pliny the Elder ( 1st century AD) and is most likely primary. The ancient name &quot;Drinus&quot; has undergone sound changes reaching the current Albanian form &quot;Drin&quot; through the evolution of Albanian sound changes.
*Veles (&quot;Qyprill&quot; in Albanian) was renamed during Ottoman rule as &quot;Köprülü&quot;, named after the noble Köprülü family.
*Malesia (&quot;Malësia&quot; in Albanian) is a small region north of Struga. The toponym &quot;Malesija&quot; is of Albanian origin from the word &quot;Malësi&quot; meaning a mountainous area or region.
*Šar (&quot;Sharr&quot; in Albanian) is a mountain range in Kosovo, Albania and North Macedonia.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===
The multi-layered Albanian dialects in western Macedonia demonstrate that they have, at different stages, immigrated into an area that was inhabited by Albanians since antiquity. The name development of &#x27;Shtip&#x27; and &#x27;Shkupi&#x27; may indicate that Proto-Albanian was spoken in the region in pre-Slavic antiquity. Mihaescu argues that Albanian evolved in a region with much greater contact to Western Romance regions than to Romanian-speaking regions, and located this region in present-day Albania, Kosovo and Western North Macedonia, spanning east to Bitola and Pristina.

The toponym Albanopolis has been found on a funeral inscription in Gorno Sonje, near the city of Skopje (ancient Scupi), present-day North Macedonia. It was discovered in 1931 by Nikola Vulić and its text was analyzed and published in 1982 by Borka Dragojević-Josifovska. The inscription in Latin reads &quot;POSIS MESTYLU F[ILIUS] FL[AVIA] DELVS MVCATI F[ILIA] DOM[O] ALBANOP[OLI] IPSA DELVS&quot;. It is translated as &quot;Posis Mestylu, son of Flavia, daughter of Delus Mucati, who comes from Albanopolis&quot;. It dates to the end of the 1st century CE or the beginning of the 2nd century CE.

The ethnonym Albanos was found on a funeral inscription from ancient Stobi in present-day North Macedonia, near Gradsko about 90 km to the southeast of Gorno Sonje. The inscription in ancient Greek reads &quot;ΦΛ(ΑΒΙΩ) ΑΛΒΑΝΩ ΤΩ ΤΕΚΝΩ ΑΙΜΙΛΙΑΝΟΣ ΑΛΒΑΝΟ(Σ) ΜΝΗΜ(Η)Σ [ΧΑΡΗΝ]&quot; (&quot;In memory of Flavios Albanos, his son Aemilianos Albanos&quot;). It dates to the 2nd/3rd century AD.

=== Middle Ages ===
The Slavic migration probably shaped the present geographic spread of the Albanians. It is likely that Albanians took refuge in the mountainous areas of northern and central Albania, eastern Montenegro, western North Macedonia and Kosovo. Long-standing contact between Slavs and Albanians might have been common in mountain passages and agriculture or fishing areas, in particular in the valleys of the White and Black branches of the Drin and around the Shkodër and Ohrid lakes. The contact with one another in these areas have caused many changes in Slavic and Albanian local dialects.

Placenames with the designation &quot;Arbanasi&quot;, an archaic term for Albanians, are usually found in &quot;onomastic provinces&quot; throughout the area of western, northeastern, central and southern North Macedonia: located in the area of Skopje, Kumanovo, Sveti Nikole, Stip, Kratovo, Prespa, Bitola, Ohrid, Prilep, Kichevo, Gostivar, and Tetovo. These &quot;Albanian onomastic provinces&quot; in the area of North Macedonia are chronologically old, which speaks of early contacts of Arbanasi (Albanians) with Latin and Old Slavic, and goes against the idea of a late 18th-century migration of Albanians into Macedonia.

In a document of Serbian King Stefan Milutin that dates between 1293 and 1302, in which the citizens of Štip are named, there are several figures listed with Albanian names and anthroponomy. Likewise, in a charter issued by the same ruler in 1300, it is noted that whoever visited the market of Skopje - be they Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian, Latin, Albanian, or Vlach - must pay the dues in both Tetovo and Gračanica. Furthermore, in a 1330 letter by Serbian Tsar Stefan Dušan, several figures with Albanian names and anthroponomy (including the last name &quot;Arbanasin&quot;, which literally means &quot;Albanian&quot;) were recorded. In 1350 the Serbian Tsar had donated a church and a number of serfs to the nobleman Ivanko around the region of Štip, and among the serfs a certain &quot;Gin Arbanasi&quot; is attested.

In a text by Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos there is mention of nomadic Albanians present in the vicinity of Ohrid at around 1328. Andrea Gropa ruled the region and the city of Ohrid as an ally of &quot;King of Serbia&quot; Vukašin Mrnjavčević until Vukašin&#x27;s death in 1371, with Andrea beginning a rivalry with his son, Prince Marko. Ruling as an independent ruler since the time of Vukašin, Andrea became &quot;de jure&quot; independent from Prince Marko in 1371 and was referred to as Župan and Gospodar of Ohrid (Lord of Ochrid). He joined the Albanian ruler and noble Andrea II Muzaka, and managed to take Kostur, Prilep and all Dibër region from Marko by that year. During Andrea&#x27;s reign, the Gropa family forged their own coins.
Albanian noble families controlled swathes of land in North Macedonia during different historical periods within the Middle Ages. The Gropa family ruled the regions between Pogradec, Ohrid and Debar during the 12th — 14th centuries.
The presence of Albanians within modern-day North Macedonia is attested to by Serbian kings of the Middle Ages. In 1330, Stefan Dečanski explicitly mentioned the presence of Albanians and the Albanian names of villages in Kosovo, particularly in the district of Prizren, as well as within the district of Skopje. Between 1348 and 1353, Albanians are mentioned by Stefan Dušan as farmers and soldiers in the district of Tetovo and frequenters of the Fair of Saint George held in the vicinity of Skopje. In fact, entire Albanian villages were gifted by Serbian kings, especially by Stefan Dušan, as presents to the Serbian monastery of Tetovo, as well as to the monasteries of Prizren and Deçan.

In the Middle Ages, Dibër was part of the Principality of Kastrioti ruled by the royal Kastrioti family with Gjon Kastrioti on the Albanian throne. After the death of Gjon Kastrioti in 1437, the eastern region was annexed by the Ottomans and became seat of the Sanjak of Dibra. Skanderbeg carried out several military actions in the territory of modern-day North Macedonia during his rebellion against the Ottoman Turks, such as the Battle of Oranik and the Battle of Ohrid. Svetigrad had initially served as a fortress for the League of Lezhë before being taken by the Ottomans. Both Svetigrad and Modriç, along with the surrounding areas in the Dibër region, were under Skanderbeg&#x27;s control.

=== Ottoman Empire ===

The arrest and liquidation of local Albanophone pashas, most notably that of Abdurrahman Pasha of Kalkandelen (now &quot;Tetova&quot;) and his two brothers, Havzi Pasha of Üsküb (now &quot;Shkup&quot;) and Hussein Pasha of Kustendil, directly caused the Uprising of Dervish Cara, which occurred between 1843 and 1844. The rebels of this uprising were led by Dervish Cara, and they had the support of the Christian population as well as other Albanophone pashas. The revolt began in Üsküb in July 1843 and several Ottoman-controlled towns and regions were captured over the next two years - in North Macedonia, these territories included Gostivar, Tetova, Skopje, Kumanova, Ohrid and Manastir. The Ottoman government declared an amnesty, the abolishment of the new taxes and the postponement of the recruitment process, in an effort to disunite the rebels. In May 1844, the Ottoman army attacked the rebels, forcing them to retreat to the areas of Kalkandelen, Üsküb and Kumanova. Heavy fighting took place from 13 to 17 May 1844 in Katlanovo Pass, and on 18 May in Katlanovo thermals. The rebels could no longer resist the numerically superior and better-armed Ottoman army. In May–July, the Ottoman army retook all areas taken by the rebels. Dervish Cara was captured by Ottoman forces in summer 1844.

The resistance would continue in the Dibër valley, which was very strong under its local leaders. Ottoman forces led by Rexhep Pasha were defeated by the rebels in the field of Mavrova. The rebels in the Sanjak of Dibër were led from Sheh Mustafa Zerqani, a Bektashi priest. In a meeting in November 1844 they declared that the old autonomy of Dibër was not to be changed. The rebel army led by Cen Leka tried to stop the advancing Ottoman army led by Hayredin Pasha. The Ottoman commander declared again an amnesty, the abolishment of the new taxes and the postponement of the recruitment process which would become voluntary in the future.

The League of Prizren fought against Bulgarian groups and repelled them in the regions of Köprülü, Përlep and Manastir, which were at that time inhabited by Albanians, wiping out the Bulgarian movements in those areas.

In a 1903 document by the Cartographic Society of Sofia, the villages of Struga Malesia were all registered with Albanian Orthodox majorities, but nowadays they have assimilated and identify as Macedonians.
There is a sizeable amount of Turkified Albanians in Ohrid who originate from the cities of Elbasan, Durrës and Ulcinj. A significant part of the Muslim Albanian population of Kumanovo and Bitola was also Turkified during Ottoman rule.

An Albanian revolt took place against the Ottoman Empire lasted from January until August 1912. Albanians took Skopje on August. The revolt ended when the Ottoman government agreed to fulfill the rebels&#x27; demands, namely the creation of an Albanian Vilayet and expansion of Albanians rights on 4 September 1912.

German linguist Gustav Weigand described the process of Turkification of the Albanian urban population of Macedonia in his 1923 work &quot;Ethnographie Makedoniens&quot; (&quot;Ethnography of Macedonia&quot;). He writes that in the cities, especially noting Skopje and Bitola, many of the Turkish inhabitants are in fact Albanians, being distinguished by the difference in articulation of certain Turkish words, as well as their clothing and tool use. They speak Albanian at home, however use Turkish when in public. They refer to themselves as &quot;Turks&quot;, the term at the time also being a synonym for &quot;Muslim&quot;, with ethnic Turks referring to them as &quot;Turkoshak&quot;, a derogatory term for someone portraying themselves as Turkish.

===Balkan Wars===

During the Balkan wars Serbia took control of cities in northern and western Ottoman Macedonia, lands inhabited by a large Albanian population. The advance of the Serbian army as well as the formation of local Chetnik groups was followed beatings, imprisonments, massacres, disarmaments, burnings of Albanian villages as well as looting Albanian possessions. In this state of war, large numbers of Albanians fearing persecution by the Serbian army fled to Anatolia, mostly from Kumanovo and Skopje but also from Veles, Prilep, Krushevo, Tetovo, Gostivar, Kichevo, Ohrid and Bitola. Most of these Muhacirs never returned. After the Battle of Kumanovo, Chetnik paramilitary groups supported by the Serbian Army attacked and expelled the Albanian populations of Kratovo, Štip, Veles, Kruševo and Bitola. Albanians were massacred in Skopje, Veles, Prilep, Tetovo, Gostivar and most other cities.

=== Yugoslavia ===

Shortly after the defeat of Turkey by the Balkan allies, a conference of ambassadors of the Great Powers (Britain, Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, France, and Italy) convened in London in December 1912 to settle the outstanding issues raised by the conflict. With support given to the Albanians by Austria-Hungary and Italy, the conference agreed to create an independent state of Albania, which became a reality in 1913. However, the boundaries of the new state were drawn in such a way that large areas with Albanian populations remained outside of Albania, including the area that would go on to become the Socialist Republic of Macedonia.

During the Skopje communist party conference held on August 12–13, 1945, Qemal Sejfulla, a representative of the Turkish minority, although himself of Albanian origin from Kaçanik, declared that: &quot;In the cities there are some regroupings - differentiations between Turks and Albanians. As it is known that the great Serbian policy towards the Albanian masses was a policy of physical liquidations. While the policy towards the Turks - was more tolerant, for which a very large part of the Albanians became Turks - were assimilated.&quot;

When the Socialist Republic of Macedonia was established in 1946, the constitution guaranteed the right of minorities to cultural development and free use of their language. Minority schools and classes in minority languages were introduced immediately, in order to counter the high percentage of illiteracy among these groups. In the following two decades, the communist party continuously introduced measures meant to promote the incorporation of the Albanian community into the economic and social life of the new socialist state through education, professional training, and social opportunities.

A policy of Turkification of the Albanian population was employed by the Yugoslav authorities in cooperation with the Turkish government, stretching the period of 1948–1959. A commission was created to tour Albanian communities in Macedonia, visiting Tetovo, Gostivar, Debar, Kičevo, Struga, Kumanovo, Gjorče Petrov and Resen. Starting in 1948, six Turkish schools were opened in areas with large Albanian majorities, such as Tearce, Gorna Banjica, Dolna Banjica Vrapčište as well as in the outskirts of Tetovo and Gostivar. In 1951–52, a total of 40 Turkish schools were opened in Debar, Kičevo, Kumanovo, Struga, Resen, Bitola, Kruševo and Prilep.

In 1952, Yugoslavia and Turkey signed a free emigration agreement that allowed for Muslims in Yugoslavia to migrate to Turkey. Some of these individuals from more northern portions of Yugoslavia did not complete their migrations and instead settled in Macedonia, including 10,643 Albanians from Sandžak.

Contemporary analysis described cases of resistance to the Turkish schools in the Polog area, with Albanian speaking students and teachers refused to attend Turkish schools. In Tetovo, none of the native teachers wanted to give lessons in Turkish, so substitutes from Skopje were brought in instead. Another notable case happened in Gostivar, where a teacher from Banjica, who according to the committees analysis: &quot;even though he was born in the same village and his mother tongue is Turkish, when the Turkish school was opened he refused to teach in Turkish and had asked to work in Albanian villages ...&quot;. Thus the Yugoslav committee characterized the local population as having adopted a &quot;Greater Albanian political worldview&quot;. Resistance against the opening of Turkish schools was most prevalent in Tetovo and Gostivar. In 1952, on the night of Eid al-Adha, the local Tetovo political leader Mehmet Riza Gega distributed flyers imploring Albanian parents from sending their children to Turkish speaking schools. In Gostivar the nationalist activist Myrtezan Bajraktari was detained and interrogated by the Yugoslav secret police (UDBA). During his interrogation he stated he openly opposed the Turkish schools, and that he does so &quot;just so Albanians can feel like patriots and not allow themselves to be Turkified.&quot;

In the late 1980s when the autonomy of the province of Kosovo was revoked, and the repression of the Albanian population significantly increased, these developments also took place in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Albanian was removed from public sight, Albanian families were prohibited from naming their children with Albanian names on the ground that it caused divisions with the other communities in the republic, and finally, to lower the significantly high birth rate of the Albanian population, Albanian families were prohibited from having more than two children. This assimilative campaign can be clearly seen by the fact that in 1990 the amended Constitution redefined the state from &quot;a state of the Macedonian people and the Albanian and Turkish nationalities&quot; to a &quot;national state of the Macedonian people&quot;.

=== Contemporary ===
In 1994 the US Department of State&#x27;s Report on Human Rights in Macedonia reported that the following forms of discrimination against ethnic Albanians existed in Macedonia: limited access to Albanian-language media and education; poor representation in public sector jobs; poor representation in the police corps; poor representation in the military officer corps; denial of citizenship to many long-time ethnic Albanian residents of Macedonia as well as discrimination in the process of citizenship applications; and unfair drawing of voting districts which dilutes their voting strength.

In the September 2002 elections, an SDSM-led pre-election coalition won half of the 120 seats in parliament. Branko Crvenkovski was elected Prime Minister in coalition with the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) party and the Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP).

On 26 November 2019, an earthquake struck Albania. Albanians from North Macedonia responded in large numbers to the Albanian government&#x27;s appeal for financial assistance through donations to various humanitarian organisations and special bank accounts fundraising for aid.

== Demography ==
According to the 1903 Austrian consular reports on ethnic composition of the kazas of the Sanjak of Skopje in 1903, the kaza of Kočani was populated by a total of 39,406 inhabitants, of whom 16,524 (41.93%) were Bulgarian Exarchists, 11,600 (29.44%) Ottoman Muslim, 7,800 (19.79%) Albanians, 1,680 (4.26%) Aromanians, 1,090 (2.77%) Patriarchists and 712 (1.8%) Romanis.

In the 1953 census, large portions of Albanians declared themselves as ethnic Turks:
*In the municipality of Lipkovo, 12,733 Albanians were registered in 1948 a number which dropped to 3609 in 1953. The Turkish population went from numbering 5 people in 1948, to 9,878 in 1953.

Of the 203,087 Turks in Macedonia in 1953, 27,086 or 13.28% gave Albanian as their mothertongue.

Since the end of World War II, the Socialist Republic of Macedonia&#x27;s population has grown steadily, with the greatest increases occurring in the ethnic Albanian community. From 1953 through the time of the latest census in 2002 (initial results were released December 2003), the percentage of Albanians living in North Macedonia rose 25.2%. Most of the ethnic Albanians live in the western part of the country.
According to the official census data, Albanians made up 19% of the total population in 1953. The population fell to 13% in 1961, but grew again in 1971 to 17%. The group formed 19.7% in 1981 and 21% in 1991. At the last census in 2002, the Albanian population was at 25.2%. Ethnologue in 2002 estimated some 500,000 people speaking Albanian in North Macedonia. In the decade since the republic declared independence from Yugoslavia, some Albanians have claimed to account for 30% of the population and demanded an appropriate share of power. On the other side, ethnic Macedonians said Albanians were barely 20%. However, the widely accepted number of Albanians in North Macedonia is according to the internationally monitored 2002 census. The census data estimated that Albanians account for about 25.2% of the total population. The 2012 census was not held and boycotted by the Albanian political parties. In the 2008 Macedonian parliamentary elections, Albanian political parties received 22.61% of the total vote, receiving 29 of 120 seats.

Albanian is co-official at a state level (excluding defense and monetary policy) and in local self-government units where speakers of the population are 20% or more. The change in status occurred in 2019 as use of Albanian became no longer geographically limited. The new law extended the official use of Albanian over the entire country, easing communication in Albanian with the institutions. Under the new legislation, Macedonian continues to be the primary official language, while Albanian may be used now as a second one, including at a national level in official matters. The legislation stipulates also all public institutions in the country will provide Albanian translations in their everyday work.

The Albanian population in the country is largely rural with ethnic Albanians forming a majority or plurality in only 3 of the country&#x27;s 34 cities.

Around 35% of the newborns in North Macedonia belong to the Albanian ethnic minority. In 2017, 21,754 children were born in Macedonia. The ethnic affiliation of these newborns was: 11,260 (51.76%) Macedonian; 7,404 (34.03%) Albanians; 940 (4.32%) Turkish; 1,276 (5.87%) Roma; 40 (0.18%) Vlach; 129 (0.59%) Serbian; 213 (0.98%) Bosniaks; 492 (2,26%) other ethnic affiliation and unknown.

=== Municipalities ===
According to the 2021 census, of the 80 municipalities in the country Albanians were the dominant resident ethnic group in 17 municipalities, with 15 having a resident ethnic Albanian majority and 2 a resident ethnic Albanian plurality. When accounting the total population, including self-enumerated diaspora, Albanians make up the majority in 16 municipalities and the plurality in 2.

== Politics ==
=== Parties ===
North Macedonia has a few Albanian parties. As of 2020 election The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and the Alliance for Albanians are the two largest Albanian political parties in the country. In the 2008 Macedonian parliamentary elections, DUI won 11.3% of the total vote, while DPA got 10.1%. However, due to pre-election fights between the two main Albanian political parties, some Albanian areas of the country have revoted.

In the 2011 Macedonian parliamentary elections, Albanian parties received 20.96% of the total popular vote. DUI received 10.2% of the vote, giving it 15 seats. This is a loss of 3 seats from the previous elections. DPA received 5.9% of the vote, winning 8 seats which is also a drop of 3 seats from the 2008 election. The third Albanian party to receive seats in parliament is the National Democratic Revival party which received two seats with 2.7% of the vote.

In the 2014 elections, three Albanian parties, DUI, DPA, and NDP won 19 seats, seven seats, and one seat, respectively, out of the 123 total seats. Ethnic Albanians parties received just under 21% of the total popular vote.

== Discrimination ==

Ethnic tensions have simmered in North Macedonia since the end of an armed conflict in 2001, where in July 2001, former NLA fighters created the Albanian National Army (ANA, AKSh), and announced itself on 3 August 2001. The group participated in attacks against Macedonian forces alongside the NLA. After the NLA disbanded, the ANA began to operate in the Preševo Valley.

The Macedonian Academy for Science and Art was accused of Albanophobia in 2009 after it published its first encyclopaedia in which it was claimed that , the Albanian endonym that is primarily used by other Balkan peoples to describe Albanians, is considered derogatory by the Albanian community if used in South Slavic languages. The encyclopaedia also claimed that the Albanians settled the region in the 16th century. Distribution of the encyclopaedia was ceased after a series of public protests.

On 12 April 2012, five ethnic Macedonian civilians were shot dead – allegedly by ethnic Albanians – in an attack known as the Smilkovci lake killings. On 16 April 2012, a protest against these attacks and demanding justice was held in Skopje. Some of the participants in the protests were chanting anti-Albanian slogans.

On 1 March 2013 in Skopje, a mob of ethnic Macedonians protested against the decision to appoint Talat Xhaferi, an ethnic Albanian politician, as Minister of Defence. The protest turned violent when the mob started hurling stones and also attacking Albanian bystanders and police officers alike. The police reports 3 injured civilians, five injured police officers and much damage to private property. Although the city hospital reported treating five heavily injured Albanian men, two of which are on intensive care unit. During this protest part of the mob burned the Albanian flag. A mob of Macedonian nationalists also stormed the Macedonian Parliament on 27 April 2017 in reaction to the election of Talat Xhaferi as Speaker of the Assembly, numerous were injured during the riot.

On the 108th anniversary of the Congress of Manastir, the museum of the Albanian alphabet in Bitola was vandalized, the windows and doors were broken. A poster with the words &quot;Death to Albanians&quot; and with the drawing of a lion cutting the heads of the Albanian double-headed eagle was placed on the front doors of the museum. One week after this incident, on the day of the Albanian Declaration of Independence, graffiti with the same messages, as those of the previous week, were placed on the directorate of Pelister National Park.

=== Current issues ===

Amongst the unemployed, Albanians are highly overrepresented. In public institutions as well as many private sectors they are underrepresented. They also face discrimination by public officials and employers. According to the United States&#x27; Country Report on Human Rights 2012 for Macedonia, &quot;certain ministries declined to share information about ethnic makeup of employees&quot;. The same report also added:
As of 2019, the Albanian language is a co-official language in the country.

== Religion ==

The main religion among Albanians in North Macedonia is Islam, though there are some who are Roman Catholic, with the most prominent member Agnes (&quot;Anjeza&quot;) Bojaxhiu, also known as Mother Teresa. Another prominent figure is the composer Lorenc Antoni.

===Eastern Orthodox===

Orthodox Christian Albanian villages located in Upper Reka, as well as historic communities in Ohrid, Malesia, Resen, Kumanovo (in particular the nearby abandoned village of Dumanovce) as well as Bitola city and certain surrounding villages (Trnovo, Nižepole and Magarevo). These communities largely assimilated into the Slavic corpus.

In the 18th century, Orthodox Albanian refugees fleeing the socio-political and economic crises in what is now southern Albania, settled in Krusevo, often in groups of families and led by a priest. Orthodox Albanians arrived from Vithkuq and the Opar region while local Kruševo traditions also relate that other families arrived from Korçë and the villages of Polenë, Dardhë, and Mborje. In the beginning of the 19th century, Orthodox Albanians from Moscopole settled in Kruševo, founding the so called &quot;Ohtul di Arbinesh&quot; (Hill of the Albanians) neighborhood. This community would soon assimilate into the Aromanian population of the city. In the early 20th century, Kruševo consisted of a mixed population of 4,950 Bulgarians, 4,000 Vlachs (Aromanians) and 400 Christian Albanians, according to Bulgarian geographer Vasil Kanchov&#x27;s statistics. Due to intermarriage with locals, at the onset of the twentieth century few in the small local Orthodox Albanian community spoke Albanian. A neighbourhood inhabited by Aromanians in Kruševo still bears the name &quot;Arbineš&quot; meaning Albanians in the Aromanian language. Per Bulgarian teacher Nikola Kirov, who was native to the town, most of the Orthodox Albanians were (sic) &quot;Grecomans&quot;.

During the Ottoman period, besides the ethnic Turks and the majority Slavic population, Prilep was also home to both a Sunni Muslim and Orthodox Christian Albanian community, which lived alongside . Serbian historiographer Jovan Hadži-Vasiljević writes that:

Bulgarian researcher, Georgi Traichev, wrote that:
 The newspaper &quot;Прилепу преди 100 години&quot; (&quot;Prilep 100 years ago&quot;. Sofia, 1938) reports that after the arrival of Orthodox Albanians in the city around the 18th-19th century, the Christian Vlach and Albanian elements have assimilated under the influence of Bulgarian population, and that there are no longer any traces of them. Information is also given for Albanians of both denominations. Of the Orthodox Albanians, a part has been Bulgarianized, while others have been Hellenised. In the newspaper there is also a report about the Orthodox Albanian entitled &quot;Ico Kishari&quot;, whose family, along with the &quot;Tilevci, Georgimajkovci&quot; and &quot;Ladcovci&quot;, were Orthodox Albanian refugees from Moscopole who had settled in the beginning of the 19th century. 

Two dozen Orthodox Albanians were recorded as living in the villages of Konopište and Mrežičko near Kavadarci in 1900. In 1905, Dimitar Mishev Brancoff gathered statistics about the Christian population of Macedonia, in which the population of Veles appears as consisting of, among others, 12 Christian Albanians. 

In statistics gathered by Vasil Kanchov in 1900, the city of Skopje was inhabited by 31900 people, of whom 150 were Christian Albanians.

Researcher Dimitar Gađanov wrote in 1916 that Gostivar was populated by, among others, 100 Orthodox Albanians.

== Culture ==

The spoken dialects of Albanian are Gheg, by majority, and Tosk in parts of the south. Education in Albanian is provided in all levels, including university levels, such as State University of Tetovo, South East European University, also in Tetovo.

Pjetër Bogdani (), known in Italian as Pietro Bogdano, is the most original writer of early literature in Albania. He is author of the Cuneus Prophetarum (The Band of the Prophets), 1685, the first prose work of substance written originally in Albania. Born in Gur i Hasit, Has, near Kukës district, Albania about 1630, Bogdani was educated in the traditions of the Catholic Church to which he devoted all his energy. His uncle, Andrea Bogdani (), was Archbishop of Skopje and author of a Latin-Albanian grammar, now lost.

<text>A 6-4-4-6 steam locomotive, in the Whyte notation for describing locomotive wheel arrangements, is one with six leading wheels, two sets of four driving wheels, and six trailing wheels.

Other equivalent classifications are:
* UIC classification: 3BB3 (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
* French classification: 3223
* Turkish classification: 2525
* Swiss classification: 2/5+2/5 up to the early 1920s, later 4/10

Only one was produced, the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s sole class S1 of 1939. It was a duplex locomotive, the longest and heaviest rigid frame reciprocating steam locomotive ever built and is referred to as the &quot;Pennsylvania Type&quot;. This experimental locomotive was exhibited at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, and was afterward placed in limited service between Chicago, Illinois, and Crestline, Ohio. The locomotive was too large to work elsewhere in the system. Pennsylvania Railroad executive hoped that the locomotive could haul 1,000 tons at 100 miles per hour, which were exceeded in a December 1940 test run which reached 101 mph with 1,350 tons being pulled. While it was capable of very high speeds, no firm documentary evidence has so far surfaced to confirm the record 133 mph run cited in the December 1941 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine which, if true, would make this locomotive the fastest steam locomotive ever built.

<text>Plants that cause illness or death after consuming them are referred to as poisonous plants. The toxins in poisonous plants affect herbivores, and deter them from consuming the plants. Plants cannot move to escape their predators, so they must have other means of protecting themselves from herbivorous animals. Some plants have physical defenses such as thorns, spines and prickles, but by far the most common type of protection is chemical.

Over millennia, through the process of natural selection, plants have evolved the means to produce a vast and complicated array of chemical compounds to deter herbivores. Tannin, for example, is a defensive compound that emerged relatively early in the evolutionary history of plants, while more complex molecules such as polyacetylenes are found in younger groups of plants such as the Asterales. Many of the known plant defense compounds primarily defend against consumption by insects, though other animals, including humans, that consume such plants may also experience negative effects, ranging from mild discomfort to death.

Many of these poisonous compounds also have important medicinal benefits. The varieties of phytochemical defenses in plants are so numerous that many questions about them remain unanswered, including:

# Which plants have which types of defense?
# Which herbivores, specifically, are the plants defended against?
# What chemical structures and mechanisms of toxicity are involved in the compounds that provide defense?
# What are the potential medical uses of these compounds?

These questions and others constitute an active area of research in modern botany, with important implications for understanding plant evolution and medical science.

Below is an extensive, if incomplete, list of plants containing one or more poisonous parts that pose a serious risk of illness, injury, or death to humans or domestic animals. There is significant overlap between plants considered poisonous and those with psychotropic properties, some of which are toxic enough to present serious health risks at recreational doses. There is a distinction between plants that are poisonous because they naturally produce dangerous phytochemicals, and those that may become dangerous for other reasons, including but not limited to infection by bacterial, viral, or fungal parasites; the uptake of toxic compounds through contaminated soil or groundwater; and/or the ordinary processes of decay after the plant has died; this list deals exclusively with plants that produce phytochemicals. Many plants, such as peanuts, produce compounds that are only dangerous to people who have developed an allergic reaction to them, and with a few exceptions, those plants are not included here (see list of allergens instead). Despite the wide variety of plants considered poisonous, human fatalities caused by poisonous plants – especially resulting from accidental ingestion – are rare in the developed world.

== Poisonous plants used as food ==
Many plants commonly used as food possess toxic parts, are toxic unless processed, or are toxic at certain stages of their lives. Some only pose a serious threat to certain animals (such as cats, dogs, or livestock) or certain types of people (such as infants, the elderly, or the immunocompromised). Most of these food plants are safe for the average adult to eat in modest quantities. Notable examples include:

== Other poisonous plants ==
Countless other plants not commonly used in food or drink are also poisonous, and care should be taken to avoid accidentally contacting or ingesting them. Some of these are popular ornamental plants or are cultivated for purposes other than consumption.

<doc id="1257011" wikidata="Q3155530" url="?curid=1257011" title="United States non-interventionism">
<text>United States non-interventionism primarily refers to the foreign policy that was eventually applied by the United States between the late 18th century and the first half of the 20th century whereby it sought to avoid alliances with other nations in order to prevent itself from being drawn into wars that were not related to the direct territorial self-defense of the United States. Neutrality and non-interventionism found support among elite and popular opinion in the United States, which varied depending on the international context and the country&#x27;s interests. At times, the degree and nature of this policy was better known as isolationism, such as the interwar period, while some consider the term &quot;isolationism&quot; to be a pejorative used to discredit non-interventionist policy.

Due to the start of the Cold War in the aftermath of World War II and the rise of the United States as a global superpower, its traditional foreign policy turned towards American imperialism with diplomatic and military interventionism, engaging or somehow intervening in virtually any overseas armed conflict ever since, and concluding multiple bilateral and regional military alliances, chiefly the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Non-interventionist policies have had continued support from some Americans since World War II, mostly regarding specific armed conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Syria, and Ukraine.

==Background==

Robert Walpole, Britain&#x27;s first Whig Prime Minister, proclaimed in 1723: &quot;My politics are to keep free from all engagements as long as we possibly can.&quot; He emphasized economic advantage and rejected the idea of intervening in European affairs to maintain a balance of power. Walpole&#x27;s position was known to Americans. However, during the American Revolution, the Second Continental Congress debated about forming an alliance with France. It rejected non-interventionism when it was apparent that the American Revolutionary War could be won in no other manner than a military alliance with France, which Benjamin Franklin successfully negotiated in 1778.

After Britain and France went to war in 1792, George Washington declared neutrality, with unanimous support of his cabinet, after deciding that the treaty with France of 1778 did not apply. Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address of 1796 explicitly announced the policy of American non-interventionism:
:The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible. Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.

==No entangling alliances (19th century)==

President Thomas Jefferson extended Washington&#x27;s ideas about foreign policy in his March 4, 1801 inaugural address. Jefferson said that one of the &quot;essential principles of our government&quot; is that of &quot;peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none.&quot; He also stated that &quot;Commerce with all nations, alliance with none&quot;, should be the motto of the United States. Extending at times into isolationism, both Jefferson and Madison also practiced the boycotting of belligerent nations with the Embargo Act of 1807.

In 1823, President James Monroe articulated what would come to be known as the Monroe Doctrine, which some have interpreted as non-interventionist in intent: &quot;In the wars of the European powers, in matters relating to themselves, we have never taken part, nor does it comport with our policy, so to do. It is only when our rights are invaded, or seriously menaced that we resent injuries, or make preparations for our defense.&quot; It was applied to Hawaii in 1842 in support of eventual annexation there, and to support U.S. expansion on the North American continent.

After Tsar Alexander II put down the 1863 January Uprising in Poland, French Emperor Napoleon III asked the United States to &quot;join in a protest to the Tsar.&quot; Secretary of State William H. Seward declined, &quot;defending &#x27;our policy of non-intervention—straight, absolute, and peculiar as it may seem to other nations,&#x27;&quot; and insisted that &quot;[t]he American people must be content to recommend the cause of human progress by the wisdom with which they should exercise the powers of self-government, forbearing at all times, and in every way, from foreign alliances, intervention, and interference.&quot;

President Ulysses S. Grant attempted to annex the Dominican Republic in 1870, but failed to get the support of the Radical Republicans in the Senate. The United States&#x27; policy of non-intervention was wholly abandoned with the Spanish–American War, followed by the Philippine–American War from 1899 to 1902.

==20th century non-interventionism==

President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s administration is credited with inciting the Panamanian Revolt against Colombia, completed November 1903, in order to secure construction rights for the Panama Canal (begun in 1904).

President Woodrow Wilson was able to navigate neutrality in World War I for about three years, and to win 1916 reelection with the slogan &quot;He kept us out of war.&quot; The neutrality policy was supported by the tradition of shunning foreign entanglements, and by the large population of immigrants from Europe with divided loyalties in the conflict. America did enter the war in April 1917, however. Congress voted to declare war on Germany, 373 to 50 in the House of Representatives and 82 to 6 in the Senate. Technically the US joined the side of the Triple Entente only as an &quot;associated power&quot; fighting the same enemy, not as officially allied with the Entente.

A few months after the declaration of war, Wilson gave a speech to Congress outlining his aims for conclusion of the conflict, labeled the Fourteen Points. That American proclamation was less triumphalist than the stated aims of some other belligerents, and its final point proposed that a &quot;general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike.&quot; After the war, Wilson traveled to Europe and remained there for months to labor on the post-war treaty, longer than any previous Presidential sojourn outside the country. In that Treaty of Versailles, Wilson&#x27;s &quot;general association of nations&quot; was formulated as the League of Nations.

===Isolationism between the World Wars===

In the wake of the First World War, the non-interventionist tendencies gained ascendancy. The Treaty of Versailles, and thus, United States&#x27; participation in the League of Nations, even with reservations, was rejected by the Senate in the final months of Wilson&#x27;s presidency. 
Republican Senate leader Henry Cabot Lodge supported the Treaty with reservations to be sure Congress had final authority on sending the U.S. into war. Wilson and his Democratic supporters rejected the &quot;Lodge Reservations&quot;.

The strongest opposition to American entry into the League of Nations came from the Senate where a tight-knit faction known as the Irreconcilables, led by William Borah and George Norris, had great objections regarding the clauses of the treaty which compelled America to come to the defense of other nations. Senator William Borah, of Idaho, declared that it would &quot;purchase peace at the cost of any part of our [American] independence.&quot; Senator Hiram Johnson, of California, denounced the League of Nations as a &quot;gigantic war trust.&quot; While some of the sentiment was grounded in adherence to Constitutional principles, most of the sentiment bore a reassertion of nativist and inward-looking policy.

American society in the interwar period was characterized by a division in values between urban and rural areas as Americans in urban areas tended to be liberal while those in rural areas tended to be conservative. Adding to the division was that Americans in rural areas tended to be Protestant of British and/or German descent while those in urban areas were often Catholic or Jewish and came from eastern or southern Europe. The rural-urban divide was seen most dramatically in the intense debate about Prohibition as urban Americans tended to be &quot;wets&quot; while rural Americans tended to be &quot;drys&quot;. The way that American society was fractured along an urban-rural divide served to distract public attention from foreign affairs. In the 1920s, the State Department had about 600 employees in total with an annual budget of $2 million, which reflected a lack of interest on the part of Congress in foreign affairs. The State Department was very much an elitist body that recruited mostly from graduates of the select &quot;Ivy League&quot; universities, which reflected the idea that foreign policy was the concern of elites. Likewise, the feeling that the United States was taking in far too many immigrants from eastern and southern Europe-who were widely depicted in the American media as criminals and revolutionaries-led to laws restricting immigration from Europe. In turn, the anti-immigrant mood increased isolationism as the picture of Europe as a place overflowing with dangerous criminals and equally dangerous Communist revolutionaries led to the corresponding conclusion that the United States should have little as possible to do with nations whose peoples were depicted as disagreeable and unpleasant. The same way that Congress had virtually banned all non-white immigration to the United States likewise led an indifference about the fate of non-white nations such as China and Ethiopia. The debate about Prohibition in the 1920s also encouraged nativist and isolationist feelings as &quot;drys&quot; often engaged in American exceptionalism by arguing that the United States was a uniquely morally pure nation that had banned alcohol, unlike the rest of the world which remained &quot;wet&quot; and was depicted as mired in corruption and decadence.

The United States acted independently to become a major player in the 1920s in international negotiations and treaties. The Harding Administration achieved naval disarmament among the major powers through the Washington Naval Conference in 1921–22. The Dawes Plan refinanced war debts and helped restore prosperity to Germany. In August 1928, fifteen nations signed the Kellogg–Briand Pact, brainchild of American Secretary of State Frank Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand. This pact that was said to have outlawed war and showed the United States commitment to international peace had its semantic flaws. For example, it did not hold the United States to the conditions of any existing treaties, it still allowed European nations the right to self-defense, and it stated that if one nation broke the Pact, it would be up to the other signatories to enforce it. Briand had sent a message on 6 April 1927 to mark the 10th anniversary of the American declaration of war on Germany in 1917 proposing that France and the United States sign a non-aggression pact. Briand was attempting to create a Franco-American alliance to counter Germany as Briand envisioned turning the negotiations for the non-aggression pact into an some sort of an alliance. Kellogg had no interest in an alliance with France, and countered with a vague offer for a treaty to ban all war. The Kellogg–Briand Pact was more of a sign of good intentions on the part of the US, rather than a legitimate step towards the sustenance of world peace.

Another reason for isolationism was the belief that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh towards Germany and the question of war debts to the United States. American public opinion was especially hostile towards France, which was depicted in the words of the Republican Senator Reed Smoot who in August 1930 called France a greedy &quot;Shylock&quot; intent upon taking the last &quot;pound of flesh&quot; from Germany via reparations while refusing to pay its war debts to the United States. In the early 1930s, French diplomats at the embassy in Washington stated that the image of France was at an all-time low in the United States with American public opinion being especially incensed by France&#x27;s decision to default on its war debts on 15 December 1932. French diplomats throughout the interwar period complained that the German embassy and consulates in the United States waged a slick, well funded propaganda campaign designed to persuade the Americans that the Treaty of Versailles was a monstrous, unjust peace treaty while the French embassy and consulates did nothing equivalent to make the case for France. The effect of German propaganda tended to persuade many Americans it had been a huge mistake to have declared war on Germany in 1917 and it would be wrong for the United States to go to war to maintain the international order created by the Treaty of Versailles.

The economic depression that ensued after the Crash of 1929, also continued to abet non-intervention. The attention of the country focused mostly on addressing the problems of the national economy. The rise of aggressive imperialist policies by Fascist Italy and the Empire of Japan led to conflicts such as the Italian conquest of Ethiopia and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. These events led to ineffectual condemnations by the League of Nations. Official American response was muted. America also did not take sides in the brutal Spanish Civil War and withdrew its troops from Haiti with the inauguration of the Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. In an attempt to influence American public opinion into taking a more favorable view of France, the Quai d&#x27;Orsay founded in 1935 the &quot;Association our la Constitution aux Etats-Unis d&#x27;un Office Français de Renseignements&quot; based in New York, a cultural propaganda council designed to give Americans a more favorable image of France. Better known as the French Information Center, the group created a French Cinema Center to distribution of French films in the United States and by 1939 had handled out for free about 5, 000 copies of French films to American universities and high schools. The French Information Center provided briefings to American journalists and columnists about the French point of view with the emphasis upon France as a democracy that had potential powerful enemies in the form of totalitarian dictatorships such as Germany and Italy. Such propaganda did not seek to challenge American isolationism directly, but the prevailing theme was that France and the United States as democracies had more in common than what divided them. By 1939, René Doynel de Saint-Quentin, the French ambassador in Washington reported that image of France was much higher than what it had been in 1932.

=== Non-interventionism before entering World War II ===

As Europe moved closer to war in the late 1930s, the United States Congress continued to demand American neutrality. Between 1936 and 1937, much to the dismay of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Congress passed the Neutrality Acts. For example, in the final Neutrality Act, Americans could not sail on ships flying the flag of a belligerent nation or trade arms with warring nations. Such activities had played a role in American entrance into World War I.

On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, marking the start of World War II, and the United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany. In an address to the American people two days later, President Roosevelt assured the nation that he would do all he could to keep them out of war. &quot;When peace has been broken anywhere, the peace of all countries everywhere is in danger,&quot; Roosevelt said. Even though he was intent on neutrality as the official policy of the United States, he still echoed the dangers of staying out of this war. He also cautioned the American people to not let their wish to avoid war at all costs supersede the security of the nation.

The war in Europe split the American people into two camps: non-interventionists and interventionists. The two sides argued over America&#x27;s involvement in this World War II. The basic principle of the interventionist argument was fear of German invasion. One of the rhetorical criticisms of interventionism was that it was driven by the so-called merchants of death - businesses who had profited from World War I lobbying for involvement in order to profit from another large war. By the summer of 1940, France suffered a stunning defeat by Germans, and Britain was the only democratic enemy of Germany. In a 1940 speech, Roosevelt argued, &quot;Some, indeed, still hold to the now somewhat obvious delusion that we … can safely permit the United States to become a lone island … in a world dominated by the philosophy of force.&quot;

A &quot;Life&quot; survey published in July found that in the summer of 1940, 67% of Americans believed that a German-Italian victory would endanger the United States, that if such an event occurred 88% supported &quot;arm[ing] to the teeth at any expense to be prepared for any trouble&quot;, and that 71% favored &quot;the immediate adoption of compulsory military training for all young men&quot;. The magazine wrote that the survey showed &quot;the emergence of a majority attitude very different from that of six or even three months ago&quot;.

Ultimately, the ideological rift between the ideals of the United States and the goals of the fascist powers empowered the interventionist argument. Writer Archibald MacLeish asked, &quot;How could we sit back as spectators of a war against ourselves?&quot; In an address to the American people on December 29, 1940, President Roosevelt said, &quot;the Axis not merely admits but proclaims that there can be no ultimate peace between their philosophy of government and our philosophy of government.&quot;

There were still many who held on to non-interventionism. Although a minority, they were well organized, and had a powerful presence in Congress. Pro-German or anti-British opinion contributed to non-interventionism. Roosevelt&#x27;s national share of the 1940 presidential vote declined by seven percentage points from 1936. Of the 20 counties in which his share declined by 35 points or more, 19 were largely German-speaking. Of the 35 counties in which his share declined by 25 to 34 points, German was the largest or second-largest original nationality in 31.

Non-interventionists rooted a significant portion of their arguments in historical precedent, citing events such as Washington&#x27;s farewell address and the failure of World War I. &quot;If we have strong defenses and understand and believe in what we are defending, we need fear nobody in this world,&quot; Robert Maynard Hutchins, President of the University of Chicago, wrote in a 1940 essay. Isolationists believed that the safety of the nation was more important than any foreign war.

As 1940 became 1941, the actions of the Roosevelt administration made it more and more clear that the United States was on a course to war. This policy shift, driven by the President, came in two phases. The first came in 1939 with the passage of the Fourth Neutrality Act, which permitted the United States to trade arms with belligerent nations, as long as these nations came to America to retrieve the arms, and pay for them in cash. This policy was quickly dubbed, &#x27;Cash and Carry.&#x27;

The second phase was the Lend-Lease Act of early 1941. This act allowed the President &quot;to lend, lease, sell, or barter arms, ammunition, food, or any &#x27;defense article&#x27; or any &#x27;defense information&#x27; to &#x27;the government of any country whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States.&#x27;&quot; American public opinion supported Roosevelt&#x27;s actions. As United States involvement in the Battle of the Atlantic grew with incidents such as the sinking of the , by late 1941 72% of Americans agreed that &quot;the biggest job facing this country today is to help defeat the Nazi Government&quot;, and 70% thought that defeating Germany was more important than staying out of the war.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor caused America to enter the war in December 1941, isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s America First Committee and Herbert Hoover announced their support of the war effort. Isolationist families&#x27; sons fought in the war as much as others.

Propaganda activities conducted by German embassy staff such as George Sylvester Viereck, assisted by isolationist politicians such as Hamilton Fish III, were investigated and dampened by federal prosecutors before and after U.S. joined WWII. In 1941, Fish was implicated in the America First Committee franking controversy, whereby isolationist politicians were found to be using their free mailing privileges to aid the German propaganda campaign. William Power Maloney&#x27;s grand jury investigated Nazi penetration in the United States and secured convictions of Viereck and George Hill, Fish&#x27;s chief of staff.

=== Non-interventionism after World War II ===
Ohio Senator Robert A. Taft was a leading opponent of interventionism after 1945, although it always played a secondary role to his deep interest in domestic affairs. Historian George Fujii, citing the Taft papers, argues:
:Taft fought a mostly losing battle to reduce government expenditures and to curtail or prevent foreign aid measures such as the British loan of 1945 and the Marshall Plan. He feared that these measures would &quot;destroy the freedom of the individual, freedom of States and local communities, freedom of the farmer to run his own farm and the workman to do his own job&quot; (p. 375), thereby threatening the foundations of American prosperity and leading to a &quot;totalitarian state&quot; (p. 377).
In 1951, in the midst of bitter partisan debate over the Korean War, Taft increasingly spoke out on foreign policy issues. According to his biographer James T. Patterson:
:Two basic beliefs continued to form a fairly consistent core of Taft&#x27;s thinking on foreign policy. First, he insisted on limiting America&#x27;s overseas commitments. [Taft said] &quot;Nobody today can be an isolationist... The only question is the degree to which we shall take action throughout the entire world.&quot; America had obligations that it had to honor – such as NATO – and it could not turn a blind eye to such countries as Formosa or Israel. But the United States had limited funds and problems at home and must therefore curb its commitments...This fear of overcommitment was rooted in Taft&#x27;s even deeper faith in liberty, which made him shrink from a foreign policy that would cost large sums of money, increase the power of the military, and transform American society into what he called a garrison state.

Norman A. Graebner argues:
:Differences over collective security in the G.O.P. were real in 1952, but Taft tried during his pre-convention campaign to moderate his image as a &quot;go-it-aloner&quot; in foreign policy. His whole effort proved unsuccessful, largely because by spring the internationalist camp had a formidable candidate of its own in Dwight D. Eisenhower. As the personification of post-1945 American commitment to collective security, particularly in Europe, General Eisenhower had decided to run because he feared, apparently, that Taft&#x27;s election would lead to repudiation of the whole collective security effort, including NATO.

Eisenhower won the nomination and secured Taft&#x27;s support by promising Taft a dominant voice in domestic policies, while Eisenhower&#x27;s internationalism would set the foreign-policy agenda. Graebner argues that Eisenhower succeeded in moving the conservative Republicans away from their traditional attacks on foreign aid and reciprocal trade policies, and collective security arrangements, to support for those policies. By 1964 the Republican conservatives rallied behind Barry Goldwater who was an aggressive advocate of an anti-communist internationalist foreign policy. Goldwater wanted to roll back Communism and win the Cold War, asking &quot;Why Not Victory?&quot;

==Non-interventionism in the 21st century==
During the presidency of Barack Obama, some members of the United States federal government, including President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, considered intervening militarily in the Syrian Civil War. A poll from late April 2013 found that 62% of Americans thought that the &quot;United States has no responsibility to do something about the fighting in Syria between government forces and antigovernment groups,&quot; with only twenty-five percent disagreeing with that statement.

A writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to this as &quot;an isolationist streak,&quot; a characterization international relations scholar Stephen Walt strongly objected to, calling the description &quot;sloppy journalism.&quot; According to Walt, &quot;the overwhelming majority of people who have doubts about the wisdom of deeper involvement in Syria—including yours truly—are not &#x27;isolationist.&#x27; They are merely sensible people who recognize that we may not have vital interests there, that deeper involvement may not lead to a better outcome and could make things worse, and who believe that the last thing the United States needs to do is to get dragged into yet another nasty sectarian fight in the Arab/Islamic world.&quot;

In December 2013, the Pew Research Center reported that their newest poll, &quot;American&#x27;s Place in the World 2013,&quot; had revealed that 52 percent of respondents in the national poll said that the United States &quot;should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.&quot; This was the most people to answer that question this way in the history of the question, one which pollsters began asking in 1964. Only about a third of respondents felt this way a decade ago.

A July 2014 poll of &quot;battleground voters&quot; across the United States found &quot;77 percent in favor of full withdrawal from Afghanistan by the end of 2016; only 15 percent and 17 percent interested in more involvement in Syria and Ukraine, respectively; and 67 percent agreeing with the statement that, &#x27;U.S. military actions should be limited to direct threats to our national security.&#x27;&quot;
Polls indicate growing impatience among Americans with the war in Ukraine, with 2023 polls showing just 17% of Americans think their country is &quot;not doing enough&quot; to support Ukraine. This percentage is the lowest since the war began.

==Conservative policies==
Rathbun (2008) compares three separate themes in conservative policies since the 1980s: conservatism, neoconservatism, and isolationism. These approaches are similar in that they all invoked the mantle of &quot;realism&quot; and pursued foreign policy goals designed to promote national interests. Conservatives were the only group that was &quot;realist&quot; in the academic sense in that they defined the national interest narrowly, strove for balances of power internationally, viewed international relations as amoral, and especially valued sovereignty.

By contrast, neoconservatives based their foreign policy on nationalism, and isolationists sought to minimize any involvement in foreign affairs and raise new barriers to immigration.
Former Republican Congressman Ron Paul favored a return to the non-interventionist policies of Thomas Jefferson and frequently opposed military intervention in countries like Iran and Iraq.

After Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Republican Party has been divided on Ukraine&#x27;s aid, believing that it is not in the interests of the United States to get involved in a &quot;proxy war&quot; against Russia. President Donald Trump has called on the United States to push for peace talks rather than continue to support Ukraine.

<doc id="1257016" wikidata="Q3249136" url="?curid=1257016" title="North London Collegiate School">
<text>North London Collegiate School (NLCS) is a private day school for girls in England. Founded in Camden Town, it is now located in Edgware, in the London Borough of Harrow. Associate schools are located in South Korea, Jeju Island, Dubai, Vietnam, and Singapore, all of which are coeducational day and boarding schools offering the British curriculum. It is a member of the Girls&#x27; Schools Association.

The school is included in The Schools Index as one of the 150 best private schools in the world and among top 30 senior schools in the UK. NLCS Jeju is also included in this index as one of top 15 school in China and Southeast Asia.

==Location==

North London Collegiate School is located at the western edge of Edgware near Canons Park. It is accessed by car through Canons Drive from Edgware&#x27;s High Street. However both Stanmore tube station and Canons Park tube station are within walking distance.

==History==
The North London Collegiate School was founded by Frances Buss, a pioneer in girls&#x27; education. It is generally recognised as the first girls&#x27; school in the United Kingdom to offer girls the same educational opportunities as boys, and Miss Buss was the first person to use the term &#x27;Headmistress&#x27;.

The small school opened in 1850 at No.46. later renumbered No.12 Camden Street, London. 
Buss believed in the importance of home life and it remained a day school. In 1929, the school bought Canons, a modest villa built by William Hallett Esq, on the site of a palatial residence originally built in the early 18th century by the Duke of Chandos, and relocated to the property (designed by Sir Albert Richardson) in 1940.

Lucinda Elizabeth Shaw, mother to George Bernard Shaw was a director of music at the school, followed in 1908 by Lilian Manson, J.B. Manson&#x27;s wife. Her ambitious revival of Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; in 1910 gained coverage in &quot;The Times&quot;.

The school introduced a house system in 2014, with the houses being named after noted past pupils. The houses have colours, and each house has two house captains amongst the pupils (a year 9 and a year 11), and a staff head of house.

Today the school caters to girls from ages 4 to 18. It comprises a Junior School (Reception to Year 6) and Senior School (Year 7–13). Former pupils are known as ONLs, short for &quot;Old North Londoners&quot;. The uniform of North London Collegiate School is light blue and dark brown in colour, however uniform is not compulsory in sixth form.

The co-ed boarding North London Collegiate School Jeju opened in Seogwipo, South Korea in 2011. The school opened another international school in Singapore in August 2020.

==Curriculum==
North London Collegiate is one of the most academically successful schools in England, having been placed in the top two in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; exam league tables every year for over a decade. It has been an International Baccalaureate World School since October 2003 . Girls may choose to take the traditional A Levels or the Pre-U or the IB curriculum.

The girls are also encouraged to participate in non-academic pursuits. The Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme is available similarly to all independent schools. They may also take part in activities such as World Challenge Expeditions, Young Enterprise, Model United Nations and various community service projects.

==Alleged malpractice in deciding teacher-assessed grades==
In 2021 90% of its A-level entries got A* grades, whereas in 2019 the figure was only 34%. In December 2022 the Guardian revealed that the school had been the subject of an investigation by an A-level examination board into the teacher-assessed grades given to pupils in 2021. A spokesperson for NLCS claimed that there was no centre malpractice by the school. However, a whistleblower told the Guardian that the school had made decisions &quot;that had little integrity, even though they appeared to be within the rules&quot;. 

Teacher assessment grades replaced the formal exams that were cancelled due to Covid. North London Collegiate School was not the only private school under investigation. In 2021, the percentage of A* grades from English private schools was 39.5%, but only 16.1% in 2019. Dr Jo Saxton, Ofqual’s chief regulator, confirmed in October 2022 that private schools were being investigated when she appeared before the education select committee.

<doc id="1257028" wikidata="Q887306" url="?curid=1257028" title="King of Dahomey">
<text>The King of Dahomey (&quot;Ahosu&quot; in the Fon language) was the ruler of Dahomey, a West African kingdom in the southern part of present-day Benin, which lasted from 1600 until 1900 when the French Third Republic abolished the political authority of the Kingdom. The rulers served a prominent position in Fon ancestor worship leading the Annual Customs and this important position caused the French to bring back the exiled king of Dahomey for ceremonial purposes in 1910. Since 2000, there have been rival claimants as king and there has so far been no political solution. The Palace and seat of government were in the town of Abomey. Early historiography of the King of Dahomey presented them as absolute rulers who formally owned all property and people of the kingdom. However, recent histories have emphasized that there was significant political contestation limiting the power of the king and that there was a female ruler of Dahomey, Hangbe, who was largely written out of early histories.

==The first king==
Multiple lists of the kings of Dahomey have been put together and many of them start at different points for the first King of Dahomey. In various sources, Do-Aklin, Dakodonu, or Houegbadja are all considered the first king of Dahomey. Oral tradition contends that Do-Aklin moved from Allada to the Abomey plateau, Dakodonu created the first settlement and founded the kingdom (but is often considered a &quot;mere chief&quot;), and Houegbadja who settled the kingdom, built the palace and created much of the structure is often considered the first king of Dahomey. Oral tradition contends that the kings were all of the &quot;Aladaxonou&quot; dynasty, a name claiming descent from the city of Allada which Dahomey conquered in the 1700s. Historians largely believe now that this connection was created to legitimate rule over the city of Allada and that connections to the royal family in Allada were likely of a limited nature. In oral tradition of most accounts, Houegbadja is considered the first king and recognition of him happened first in the Annual Customs of Dahomey.

<text>Johannes Balthasar Brøndsted (5 October 1890 - 16 November 1965) was a Danish archaeologist and prehistorian. He was a professor at the University of Copenhagen and director of the National Museum of Denmark.

==Biography==
Brøndsted was born at Grundfør in Jutland, Denmark. He was the son of Kristine Margrethe Bruun (1858–1899) and Holger Brøndsted (1849–1916). His father was a parish priest. In 1909, he took his matriculation examination at Sorø Academy, after which he briefly studied law and art history at the University of Copenhagen and took his examination in classical philology in 1916. In 1920, he received his doctorate for his work on the relations between Anglo-Saxon art and Norse art during the Viking era.
Brøndsted begins his work at the museum in 1917 and becomes deputy inspector at the National Museum Department of Nordic Antiquity in 1918.
In 1922 and 1922, he worked in the field with Ejnar Dyggve (1887–1961) and excavated early Christian monuments in Dalmatia. His account of this excavation was published as &quot;Recherches à Salone&quot; (1928). He was a co-founder of the peer-reviewed academic journal &quot;Acta Archaeologica&quot; and editor-in-chief (1930–1948).

From 1941 through 1951, Brøndsted was a professor of Nordic archeology and European prehistory at the University of Copenhagen. He left this position to become the director of the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, a position he held from 1951 through 1960. 
Johannes Brøndsted died at Copenhagen and was buried at Frederiksberg Ældre Kirkegård in Frederiksberg.

<text>Noel or Noël is a given name, often given to both girls and boys born over the Christmas period.

Noel derives from the Old French &quot;Noël&quot;, meaning &quot;Christmas&quot;. It is a variant (and later replacement) of &quot;nael&quot;, which itself comes from the Latin &quot;natalis&quot;, meaning &quot;birth&quot;. The term &quot;natalis dies&quot; (birth day) was long used in Church Latin in reference to the birthday of Christ—or in other words: Christmas. In modern English, a Noel can also refer to a Christmas carol. The spelling with a diaeresis over the &quot;e&quot; (Noël) is used to indicate that the two vowels are pronounced separately rather than as a diphthong.

Other nicknames and modern variations include Noele, Noeline, Nowell, Noela, Noell, Noella, Noelene, Noeleen, and Noelle/Noëlle (French, feminine).

<text>Henrietta &quot;Jetty&quot; Treffz (; ; 1 July 1818, in Alsergrund – 8 April 1878, in Hietzing) was best known as the first wife of Johann Strauss II and a well-known mezzo-soprano appearing in England in 1849 to great acclaim.

==Biography==

Henrietta Chalupetzky was the only child of a Viennese goldsmith, and she studied music in Vienna, adopting her mother&#x27;s maiden name, Treffz, for professional purposes. Her career took her around Austria, Germany, and France, but in England, she first appeared with Johann Strauss I in concerts that brought her numerous accolades and felicitations. The &quot;Musical World&quot;, published in London on 5 May 1849, noted her talents: &quot;mezzo-soprano voice of beautiful quality and remarkable for freshness and equality of tone throughout the register&quot;.

On 27 August 1862, Henrietta (known as Jetty) Treffz married Johann Strauss II in the Stephansdom in Vienna, a marriage that was beneficial to Strauss as her support and keen musical and business sense influenced his works and promoted them to a superior standard. His works around that time revealed his finest creative period, and she worked with him as a music-copyist, private secretary, and manager. Their marriage was not without skepticism. The Viennese populace, long swayed by Strauss&#x27; graceful waltzes, were shocked at the announcement of their marriage, as she was 44 when they married, about seven years older than Strauss. Even his brother Josef Strauss expressed his concern at the match, but he eventually accepted that she was &quot;indispensable in the home. She writes up all accounts, copies out orchestral parts and sees to everything in the kitchen with such efficiency and kindness that is admirable&quot; in a letter dated 2 May 1869 written to his wife Caroline. Treffz&#x27;s encouragement for Strauss to apply for the coveted KK Hofballmusik-direktor post eventually bore positive results, and he was awarded the honorary position in 1863.

==Last years==
Jetty Treffz lived long enough to see her husband claim a small but encouraging success in the operetta business, however, on 8 April 1878, she suffered a heart attack and died, aged 59, the cause being reported as a disturbing letter from one of her illegitimate sons. She often spoke of herself as a &quot;poor, old cripple&quot; and of painful illnesses in the last years of her life.

She was buried in the local Hietzing cemetery, but Strauss was absent at the funeral, and all arrangements were left to his brother Eduard Strauss. Strauss remarried seven weeks later to Ernestine Dittrich on 28 May 1878.

<doc id="1257053" wikidata="Q662272" url="?curid=1257053" title="Short bowel syndrome">
<text>Short bowel syndrome (SBS, or simply short gut) is a rare malabsorption disorder caused by a lack of functional small intestine. The primary symptom is diarrhea, which can result in dehydration, malnutrition, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include bloating, heartburn, feeling tired, lactose intolerance, and foul-smelling stool. Complications can include anemia and kidney stones.
Most cases are due to the surgical removal of a large portion of the small intestine. This is most often required due to Crohn&#x27;s disease in adults and necrotising enterocolitis in young children. Other causes include damage to the small intestine from other means and being born with an abnormally short intestine. It usually does not develop until less than of the normally small intestine remains.
Treatment may include a specific diet, medications, or surgery. The diet may include slightly salty and slightly sweet liquids, vitamin and mineral supplements, small frequent meals, and the avoidance of high fat food. Occasionally, nutrients need to be given through an intravenous line, known as parenteral nutrition. Medications used may include antibiotics, antacids, loperamide, teduglutide, and growth hormone. Different types of surgery, including an intestinal transplant, may help some people.
Short bowel syndrome newly occurs in about three per million people each year. There are estimated to be about 15,000 people with the condition in the United States. The prevalence in the United States is approximately 30 cases per million and in Europe it is approximately 1.4 cases per million (but the rate varies widely between countries). The prevalence of short bowel syndrome has increased by more than 2 fold in the last 40 years. It is classified as a rare disease by the European Medicines Agency. Outcomes depend on the amount of bowel remaining and whether or not the small bowel remains connected with the large bowel.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of short bowel syndrome can include:
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea and steatorrhea (oily, bulky stool, which can be malodorous)
* Fluid depletion
* Weight loss and malnutrition
* Fatigue

Persons with short bowel syndrome may have complications caused by malabsorption of vitamins and minerals, such as deficiencies in vitamins A, D, E, K, B9 (folic acid), and B12, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc. These may appear as anemia, hyperkeratosis (scaling of the skin), easy bruising, muscle spasms, poor blood clotting, and bone pain.

==Causes==
Short bowel syndrome in adults and children is most commonly caused by surgery (intestinal resection). In those who undergo intestinal resection, approximately 15% eventually develop small bowel syndrome (75% of those due to 1 large resection and 25% due to multiple separate intestinal resections). This surgery may be done for:
* Crohn&#x27;s disease, an inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract
* Mesenteric ischemia, embolic or thrombotic events that may occur in the arteries or veins that supply or drain the intestines respectively, leading to disruption of blood supply to the intestines and ischemia.
* Volvulus, a twisting of the small intestine often caused by intestinal malrotation that quickly cuts off blood supply and leads to tissue death
* Tumors of the small intestine
* Radiation enteropathy, radiation injury to the small intestine, due to radiation therapy for cancer
* Injury or trauma to the small intestine
* Necrotizing enterocolitis (premature newborn)
* Bypass surgery to treat obesity
* Surgery to remove diseased or damaged portion of the small intestine

Some children are also born with an abnormally short small intestine, known as congenital short bowel.

Surgical complications, requiring re-surgery, are a common cause of small bowel syndrome, contributing up to 50% of cases based on some estimates. These surgical complications include internal hernias, volvuli, ischemia or profound hypotension.

==Pathophysiology==
The length of the small intestine can vary greatly, from as short as to as long as . On average it is about . Due to this variation it is recommended that following surgery the amount of bowel remaining be specified rather than the amount removed.

Short bowel syndrome usually develops when there is less than 2 meters (6.6 feet) of the small intestine left to absorb sufficient nutrients.

The resection of specific areas of the small bowel can lead to distinct symptoms in short bowel syndrome. The resection of the ileum leads to a malabsorption of vitamin B12, bile acids and the fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. Loss of the distal ileum also leads to loss of inhibitory hormones; leading to gastric hypersecretion, intestinal hypermotility (decreases in the intestinal transit time) leading to secretory diarrhea and macronutrient, micronutrient, vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Loss of the ileocecal valve leads to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) as bacterial flora normally found in the large intestines migrate proximally and colonize the small intestines leading to further malabsorption. SIBO leads to malabsorption as the bacteria colonizing the small intestine metabolize nutrients, directly competing with the intestinal absorption of nutrients. The bacteria colonizing the small intestines in SIBO may also cause bile acid deconjugation leading to malabsorption of lipids.

In a process called intestinal adaptation, physiological changes to the remaining portion of the small intestine occur to increase its absorptive capacity. These changes usually take place over 1–2 years. These changes include:
* Enlargement (increased diameter) and lengthening of the villi found in the lining
* Increase in the diameter of the small intestine
* Slow down in peristalsis or movement of food through the small intestine (an increase in the transit time) to increase the time available for nutrient absorption

Osteoporosis is a very common comorbidity in people with short bowel syndrome who are on parenteral nutrition, with an estimated prevalence of 57-67%. The contributing factors to the osteoporosis include malnutrition, vitamin D deficiency due to malabsorption and vitamin D deficiency due to scarce sunlight exposure due to chronic disability.

==Diagnosis==
===Definition===
Intestinal failure is decreased intestinal function such that nutrients, water, and electrolytes are not sufficiently absorbed. Short bowel syndrome is when there is less than of working bowel and is the most common cause of intestinal failure.

==Treatments==
Symptoms of short bowel syndrome are usually addressed with medication. These include:
* Anti-diarrheal medicine (e.g. loperamide, codeine)
* Vitamin and mineral supplements and L-glutamine powder mixed with water
* H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors to reduce stomach acid
* Lactase supplement (to improve the bloating and diarrhea associated with lactose intolerance)

In 2004, the USFDA approved a therapy that reduces the frequency and volume of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), comprising: NutreStore (oral solution of glutamine) and Zorbtive (growth hormone, of recombinant DNA origin, for injection) together with a specialized oral diet. After 24 weeks of successful Phase III patient treatment trials, Teduglutide was shown to be relatively safe and effective with varying degrees of benefits and adverse effects per patient. Adequate safety evaluations prove to be difficult due to a limited sample size available for study, however. In 2012, an advisory panel to the USFDA voted unanimously to approve for treatment of SBS the agent teduglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-2 analog developed by NPS Pharmaceuticals, who intend to market the agent in the United States under the brandname Gattex. Teduglutide had been previously approved for use in Europe and is marketed under the brand Revestive by Nycomed.

===Surgery===
====Prophylactic surgery====
Antiperistaltic transverse coloplasty, proposed as a prophylactic measure against short bowel syndrome, retains transverse colon function after extensive colectomies, promoting improved stool consistency and quality of life. This technique involves repositioning the colon to simulate its original placement, potentially averting short bowel syndrome-related complications and benefiting patient outcomes.

====Therapeutic surgery====
Surgical procedures to lengthen dilated bowel include the Bianchi procedure, where the bowel is cut in half and one end is sewn to the other, and a newer procedure called serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP), where the bowel is cut and stapled in a zigzag pattern. Heung Bae Kim, MD, and Tom Jaksic, MD, both of Children&#x27;s Hospital Boston, devised the STEP procedure in the early 2000s. The procedure lengthens the bowel of children with SBS and may allow children to avoid the need for intestinal transplantation. As of June 2009, Kim and Jaksic have performed 18 STEP procedures. The Bianchi and STEP procedures are usually performed by pediatric surgeons at quaternary hospitals who specialize in small bowel surgery.

==Prognosis==
After resection, having a remnant small bowel length of less than and a remaining large bowel length of less than 57% of the original length are both associated with subsequent dependence on parenteral nutrition. There is no cure for short bowel syndrome except transplant. In newborn infants, the 4-year survival rate on parenteral nutrition is approximately 70%. In newborn infants with less than 10% of expected intestinal length, 5 year survival is approximately 20%. Some studies suggest that much of the mortality is due to a complication of the total parenteral nutrition (TPN), especially chronic liver disease. As of 2006, much hope has been vested in Omegaven, a type of lipid TPN feed, for which recent case reports suggest the risk of liver disease is much lower.

Although promising, small intestine transplant has a mixed success rate, with a postoperative mortality rate of up to 30%. One-year and 4-year survival rates are 90% and 60%, respectively.

<text>Transitional ballistics, also known as intermediate ballistics, is the study of a projectile&#x27;s behavior from the time it leaves the muzzle until the pressure behind the projectile is equalized, so it lies between internal ballistics and external ballistics.

==The transitional period==
Transitional ballistics is a complex field that involves a number of variables that are not fully understood; therefore, it is not an exact science. When the bullet reaches the muzzle of the barrel, the escaping gases are still, in many cases, at hundreds of atmospheres of pressure. Once the bullet exits the barrel, breaking the seal, the gases are free to move past the bullet and expand in all directions. This expansion is what gives gunfire its explosive sound (in conjunction with the sonic boom of the projectile), and is often accompanied by a bright flash as the gases combine with the oxygen in the air and finish combusting.

The propellant gases continue to exert force on the bullet and firearm for a short while after the bullet leaves the barrel. One of the essential elements of accurizing a firearm is to make sure that this force does not disrupt the bullet from its path. The worst case is a muzzle or muzzle device such as a flash-hider that is cut at a non-square angle, so that one side of the bullet leaves the barrel early; this will cause the gas to escape in an asymmetric pattern, and will push the bullet away from that side, causing shots to form a &quot;string&quot;, where the shots cluster along a line rather than forming a normal Gaussian pattern.

Most firearms have muzzle velocities in excess of the ambient speed of sound, and even in subsonic cartridges the escaping gases will exceed the speed of sound, forming a shock wave. This wave will quickly slow as the expanding gas cools, dropping the speed of sound within the expanding gas, but at close range this shockwave can be very damaging. The muzzle blast from a high powered cartridge can literally shred soft objects in its vicinity, as careless benchrest pistol shooters occasionally find out when the muzzle slips back onto their sandbag and the muzzle blast sends sand flying.

==Initial velocity calculation==

During the first part of the intermediate ballistics period the real velocity of the projectile increases. It is caused by the propellant gases exiting the muzzle. For that reason
the real maximum projectile velocity (Vmax) is higher than the real muzzle velocity (Vr). 
The external ballistics uses so-called initial velocity Vo, which is not the same as the real muzzle velocity. The initial velocity Vo is calculated via an extrapolation of the decaying part of velocity curve to the position of the muzzle (to). The difference between these two velocities is visible in the chart.

==Altering transitional ballistics==
In addition to the process of &quot;crowning&quot; a barrel to ensure a clean and accurate exit of the bullet, there are a number of devices that attempt to harness the muzzle blast for various reasons.

===Suppressing the blast===

Flash suppressors and sound suppressors are the most obvious devices that operate in the transitional ballistics realm. These both alter the flow of the escaping gas to reduce the effects of the muzzle blast. Flash suppressors introduce turbulence into the mixing of fuel-laden hot gases escaping from the muzzle and the surrounding oxygen-rich air, reducing combustion efficiency and thus reducing the size and brightness of the flash. Sound suppressors slow the expansion of gases, allowing it to cool and reducing the rate at which it escapes to prevent a shockwave from forming.

A &quot;recoil compensator&quot; is designed to direct the gases upwards at roughly a right angle to the bore, in essence making it a small rocket that pushes the muzzle downwards, and counters the &quot;flip&quot;, or rise of the muzzle caused by the high bore line of most firearms. These are often found on &quot;raceguns&quot; used for action shooting and in heavy, rifle caliber handguns used in metallic silhouette shooting. In the former case, the compensator serves to keep the sights down on target for a quick follow-up shot, while in the latter case they keep the heavy recoil directed backwards, preventing the pistol from trying to twist out of the shooter&#x27;s grip.

A &quot;muzzle brake&quot; is designed to redirect the muzzle blast backwards, and therefore counter the recoil of the bullet. Muzzle brakes tend to be found on larger firearms, such as magnum rifles and artillery. A well designed muzzle brake can significantly reduce recoil, turning a rifle that would otherwise be punishing to shoot into a far more tolerable experience. A good example may be seen on the M82 Barrett sniper rifle.

There are downsides to both recoil compensators and muzzle brakes. They direct more of the muzzle flash to the sides or back towards the shooter—this is especially true of muzzle brakes. While eye and ear protection should always be used when shooting, this is even more essential with the muzzle blast directed back towards the shooter. Brakes and compensators are often quite bulky, adding length, diameter, and mass to the muzzle end of the firearm where it will affect the firearm&#x27;s handling worst. While a simple slot milled in the barrel, such as those used in Magna-Porting, will provide some benefit, efficient redirection of the gas flow requires large ports and baffles to deflect as much gas as possible. It is also highly inadvisable to fire sabot rounds like shotgun slugs or APDS rounds through a muzzle brake not designed for them.

<text>Levallois-Perret () is a commune in the Hauts-de-Seine department and Île-de-France region of north-central France. It lies on the right bank of the Seine, some from the centre of Paris in the north-western suburbs of the French capital. It is the most densely populated town in Europe and, together with neighbouring Neuilly-sur-Seine, one of the most expensive suburbs of Paris.

==Name==
The name Levallois-Perret comes from two housing developments, &quot;Champerret&quot; (started by landowner Jean-Jacques Perret in 1822) and &quot;Village Levallois&quot; (founded by developer Nicolas-Eugène Levallois in 1845), which resulted in the incorporation of the commune.

==History==
On the territory of what is now Levallois-Perret, before the French Revolution, stood the village of Villiers and the hamlet of Courcelles (or La Planchette). They now give their names to two Paris Métro stations. At the time of the creation of French communes during the French Revolution, they were part of the commune of Clichy, and the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine extended over what is now the south-western part of Levallois-Perret.

Landowner Jean-Jacques Perret initiated a number of housing developments in 1822 in the northeast of the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine, in a place which soon came to be known as Champerret (&quot;champ Perret&quot;: &quot;Perret field&quot;) and would later give its name to a station on the Paris Métro. Later in 1845, Nicolas-Eugène Levallois began to develop housing on behalf of André Noël, who owned land near La Planchette (in the commune of Clichy). The land developed by Levallois soon became known as the Village Levallois.

In the 1860s, the village had grown to the point of forming a single built-up area and several requests were made to the authorities for the area to be incorporated as a commune.

Eventually the requests were acceded to and on 30 June 1866 the commune of Levallois-Perret was eventually created by detaching that part of the territory of Clichy on which the Village Levallois stood and merging it with that part of Neuilly-sur-Seine occupied by Champerret.

The Eiffel company had its factory in the commune, and it was therefore in Levallois-Perret that the structures of both the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower were built.

Levallois-Perret became an important centre of the early French automotive industry with the establishment there of such companies as Clément-Bayard, Delage, and the coachbuilders Chapron and Faget &amp; Varnet. Citroën purchased the Clément-Bayard factory and produced the famous Citroën 2CV there for nearly forty years. Levallois-Perret was also an important centre of the cosmetics industry in the early 20th century. It is also home to the large European commercial real estate company Atisreal and to the conglomerate Alstom.

The northern part of the famous Île de la Jatte, in the river Seine, is where French impressionist painters created many of their masterpieces.

Patrick Balkany had been the mayor of Levallois-Perret from 2001 until 2020. He was also mayor during the period 1983–95. The current mayor, elected in 2020, is Agnès Pottier-Dumas.

==Transport==
Levallois-Perret is served by three stations on Paris Métro Line 3: Louise Michel, Anatole France, and Pont de Levallois – Bécon.

It is also served by Clichy – Levallois station on the Transilien Paris – Saint-Lazare suburban rail line.

The municipality of Levallois-Perret operates two free bus lines circulating the town.

==Sport==
Levallois Sporting Club is one of the most important sports club in France with 14500 members. Among them you can find notable sportsperson like Teddy Riner, Gauthier Grumier and Gévrise Émane. During his youth Didier Drogba played for the football section, as Joakim Noah did in basketball before moving to the United States for high school and college play and eventually the NBA.

LSC continues to operate teams in a wide variety of sports, but basketball is no longer among them. In 2007, the LSC basketball section merged with Paris Basket Racing, creating Paris-Levallois Basket, which after two name changes in the last half of the 2010s is now known as Metropolitans 92.

==Coat of arms==
The traditional coat of arms for the municipality puts emphasis on the importance of industry in its history. The centre of the arms consists of a shield with red background; a yellow gearwheel in the bottom left and a yellow perfume diffuser in the top right represent the mechanical and perfume industries.

Three red bees, are depicted on a silver bend from the top left to bottom right of the shield, these are another symbol of work in the city, beekeeping taking place at the &quot;île de la Jatte&quot;. The coat of arms also has a wreath at the bottom around the shield and three castles topping the shield; both in yellow. VILLE DE / LEVALLOIS – PERRET, is inscribed in black letters above the coat of arms.

A cartoon-style bee is used in the modern emblem of the municipality.

<doc id="1257069" wikidata="Q1861319" url="?curid=1257069" title="Battle of Slivnitsa">
<text>The Battle of [[Slivnitsa]] (, ) was a battle between the Bulgarian army and the Royal Serbian Army on 17–19 November 1885, in the Serbo-Bulgarian War. The Bulgarian victory solidified the unification between the Kingdom of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia.

==Background==
The conclusion of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) and the Congress of Berlin 1878 left Bulgaria divided into two sections. The area north of the Balkan Mountains and Sofia became an autonomous principality. Eastern Rumelia between the Balkan and Rhodope mountains gained semi-autonomous status with an Ottoman appointed Christian governor.

The Bulgarian Assembly chose Prince Alexander Battenberg as their ruler and continued to press for the reunification of their country. Political changes in 1883 caused a cooling in relations between Bulgaria and their protector Russia, who now opposed reunification.

In September 1885 a rebellion broke out in Eastern Rumelia. Alexander was placed in a difficult position. Russian opposition if he supported the revolt, or the loss of his throne unless he retained leadership of the Bulgarian national movement. He decided to keep his throne. In response the Russians recalled all their officers which left the Bulgarian army virtually leaderless above the rank of captain.

The Bulgarian army concentrated their limited forces in Eastern Rumelia, expecting an Ottoman attack that never materialised. The actual threat came from the west in the shape of King Milan&#x27;s Serbia. Bulgarian unification upset the balance of power in the Balkans and Milan demanded compensation.

==The Armies==
The Bulgarian field army in 1885 consisted of just under 30,000 men organised into 8 three-battalion infantry regiments (700 men each), 9 squadrons of cavalry and 12 eight-gun batteries. In addition, the first line of the Eastern Rumelia militia had been mobilised consisting of 12 infantry battalions, 2 squadrons of cavalry, and 4 guns. During the war the second ban of the Eastern Rumelia militia was mobilised (12 battalions) along with the Bulgarian second ban (8 battalions) and as many as 20 volunteer battalions, 3 Macedonian battalions, and some 6,000 Muslim volunteers. The army was short of senior officers. 

Confident of an easy victory and to some extent recognising that the war was not popular in Serbia, Milan only mobilised the active (first ban) army. This gave a field army of 5 divisions consisting of 80 battalions (700 men each), 21 cavalry squadrons and 46 batteries: a total of 70,000 men and 264 guns. In fact, only 49 battalions and 23 batteries were ready for the invasion, the rest, along with elements of the second ban, only became available in the last stage of the war. A key weakness was the limited number of modern Krupp and du Bange guns.

==The opening moves==
Serbia declared war on 13 November 1885 and crossed the lightly defended north-western border in three columns. The main army advanced in the centre (Šumadija, Danube and Drina divisions). To the south went the Morava division and to the north the Timok division. The plan was to break through the Bulgarian defences and concentrate four divisions before Sofia.

In response Alexander had to move his army from Eastern Rumelia to Sofia by all means available including the one limited railway line. One infantry regiment marched 95 km in 32 hours. The light Bulgarian forces on the Serbian border succeeded in slowing the Serbian advance in mountainous terrain which favoured the defence. Gradually reinforcements arrived at the previously prepared defensive position at Slivnitsa, 30 km north-west of Sofia.

==Slivnitsa 17/19 November 1885==
Alexander arrived on the evening of the 16th to find a well prepared defensive position manned by 9 battalions, plus some 2,000 volunteers and 32 guns, commanded by Major Guchev. The position consisted of nearly 4 km of trenches and artillery redoubts either side of the main road on a ridge in front of Slivnitsa village. To the right was steep mountainous terrain whilst the left wing had the easier Visker Hills towards Breznik.

The three Serbian centre divisions also arrived on the 16th and halted to recover after the fierce Bulgarian delaying action in the Dragoman Pass. The Morava division was at Tran some distance from its objective Bresnik to the south. The northern advance was bogged down along the Danube.

The morning of the 17th came with rain and mist but not the expected Serbian attack. By 10am Alexander ordered three battalions to advance on the right. They surprised the Danube division who eventually rallied and pushed them back. The main Serbian attack began on the centre largely unsupported by artillery which had insufficient range. The weight of Bulgarian fire forced them back with some 1,200 casualties. A relief column led by Captain Benderev recaptured the heights on the right and forced the Danube division back to the road.

At daybreak on the 18th the Serbians attacked the weaker left flank of the Bulgarian line. Just in time two battalions of the Preslav Regiment arrived to shore up the position. Further attacks in the centre were repulsed with heavy Serbian casualties and Benderev captured two further positions in the mountains.

On the 19th the Serbians concentrated two divisions for an attack on the Bulgarian left near Karnul (today Delyan, Sofia Province) in an attempt to join up with the Morava division. However, three battalions of Bulgarian troops led by Captain Popov from Sofia had held the Morava division in the Visker Hills and the flanking move failed. Alexander now ordered a counterattack which pushed the Serbians back on both flanks although nightfall prevented a complete collapse.

==The Bulgarians advance==
Slivnitsa was the decisive battle of the war. The Serbians fought only limited rearguard actions as they retreated and by 24 November they were back in Serbia. The Timok division in the north continued the siege of Vidin until 29 November.

The main Bulgarian army crossed the border in two strong divisions (Guchev and Nikolaev) supported by flanking columns and converged on Pirot. The Serbian army dug in on the heights west of the town. On 27 November the Bulgarian army flanked the right of the Serbian position with Prince Alexander personally leading the final attack. The Serbians were defeated and fled to Niš.

On the 28th the Austrians intervened and a ceasefire was agreed. Serbian casualties totalled 6,800 compared to 2,300 Bulgarians. Serbian sources state that the casualties in this battle totalled 3,000 for the Serbs vs 2,500 for the Bulgarians, and 7,000 for the Serbs vs 5,000 for the Bulgarians in the whole war. The Treaty of Bucharest 1886 effectively confirmed the unification of Bulgaria. Unfortunately for Prince Alexander, Russia continued to oppose his reign and he was deposed by the Russophile officers in August 1886.

<text>Africville was a small community of predominantly African Nova Scotians located in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It developed on the southern shore of Bedford Basin and existed from the early 1800s to the 1960s. From 1970 to the present, a protest has occupied space on the grounds. The government has recognized it as a commemorative site and established a museum here. The community has become an important symbol of Black Canadian identity, as an example of the &quot;urban renewal&quot; trend of the 1960s that razed similarly racialized neighbourhoods across Canada, and the struggle against racism.

Africville was founded by Black Nova Scotians from a variety of origins. Many of the first settlers were formerly enslaved African Americans from the Thirteen Colonies, Black Loyalists who were freed by the Crown during the American Revolutionary War and War of 1812. (Black people settled in Africville along Albemarle Street, where they had a school established in 1785 that served the Black community for decades under Rev. Charles Inglis.) Other residents arrived later, in association with Black people being recruited from the American South for jobs in mining at Glace Bay.

During the 20th century, Halifax neglected the community, failing to provide basic infrastructure and services such as roads, water, and sewerage. The city continued to use the area as an industrial site, notably introducing a waste-treatment facility nearby in 1958. The residents of Africville struggled with poverty and poor health conditions as a result, and the community&#x27;s buildings became badly deteriorated. During the late 1960s, the City of Halifax condemned the area, relocating its residents to newer housing in order to develop the nearby A. Murray MacKay Bridge, related highway construction, and the Port of Halifax facilities at Fairview Cove to the west. Soon after this, former residents and activists began a long protest on the site against their treatment and the condemnation.

In 1996 the site was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada as being representative of Black Canadian settlements in the province and as an enduring symbol of the need for vigilance in defence of their communities and institutions. After years of protest and investigations, in 2010 the Halifax Council ratified the Africville Apology under an arrangement with the federal government to compensate descendants and their families who had been evicted from the area. In addition, an Africville Heritage Trust was established to design a museum and build a replica of the community church.

==History==

Africville has been claimed as one of &quot;the first free Black communities outside of Africa,&quot; along with other settlements in Nova Scotia.

===Early settlement===
First known as the Campbell Road Settlement, Africville began as a small, poor, self-sufficient rural community of about 50 people during the 19th century.

The earliest colonial settlement of Africville began with the relocation of Black Loyalists, former slaves from the Thirteen Colonies who escaped from rebel masters and were freed by the British in the course of the American Revolutionary War. The Crown transported them and other Loyalists to Nova Scotia, promising land and supplies for their service. The Crown also promised land and equal rights to refugees of the 1812 War.

In 1836, Campbell Road was constructed, creating an access route along the north side of the Halifax Peninsula. After starting with the Cornwallis Street Baptist Church in 1832, clergyman Richard Preston established the Seaview African United Baptist Church in Africville in 1849, as one of five others in Halifax: Preston (1842), Beechville (1844), Hammonds Plains (1845), and Dartmouth. Accordingly, Preston, along with Septimus Clarke, are credited as co-founders of the African United Baptist Association, a network of Black Baptist churches throughout Nova Scotia.

While the community never officially was established, the first land transaction documented on paper was dated 1848. The first two landowners in Africville were William Arnold and William Brown. In the late 1850s, the Nova Scotia Railway, later to become the Intercolonial Railway, was built from Richmond to the south, bisecting Africville with the railway&#x27;s main line along the western shores of Bedford Basin.

The community became known as Africville around 1900. Many people believed the name came as result of those who lived there having come from Africa; however, this was not the case. One elderly resident of Africville has been quoted as saying &quot;It wasn&#x27;t Africville out there. None of the people came from Africa...[I]t was part of Richmond (Northern Halifax), just the part where the colour folks lived.&quot; Strangers later moved into Africville to take advantage of its unregulated status, selling illicit liquor and sex, largely to the mass of transient soldiers and sailors passing through Halifax.

A second railway line appeared in 1906 with the arrival of the Halifax and Southwestern Railway, which connected to the Intercolonial at Africville. The Intercolonial Railway, later Canadian National Railways, constructed Basin Yard west of the community, adding more tracks. Trains ran through the area constantly.

===Halifax Explosion===
With haphazardly positioned dwellings that ranged from small, well-maintained, and brightly painted homes to tiny ramshackle dwellings converted from sheds, the community had a peak population of 400 at the time of the Halifax Explosion in 1917. Elevated land to the south protected Africville from the direct blast of the explosion and the complete destruction that levelled the neighbouring community of Richmond. However, Africville suffered considerable damage. Four Africville residents (as well as one Mi&#x27;kmaq woman visiting from Queens County, Nova Scotia) were killed by the explosion. A doctor on a relief train arriving at Halifax noted Africville residents &quot;as they wandered disconsolately around the ruins of their still standing little homes.&quot;

In the aftermath of the disaster, Africville received modest relief assistance from the city, but none of the reconstruction and none of the modernization invested into other parts of the city at that time. Beginning in the early 20th century around the Great War, more people had moved there, drawn by jobs in industries and related facilities developed nearby.

==Daily life==
===Economy===
Economically, the first two generations were not prosperous, as labourers had limited opportunities. Many men found employment in low-paying jobs; others worked as seamen or Pullman porters, who would clean and work on train cars. This steady employment on the Pullman cars was considered prestigious at the time, as the men also got to travel and see the country. Only 35% of labourers had regular employment, and 65% of the people worked as domestic servants. Women were also hired as cooks, to clean the hospital or prison, and some elderly women were hired to clean upper-class houses.

===Education===
The community was neglected in terms of education. The city built the first elementary school here in 1883, at the expense of community residents. Being a poor community, none of the teachers up until 1933 had obtained formal training. Only 42
% of boys and girls received any education at all, as many families needed to have them help with paid work, or by taking care of younger siblings at home so parents could work. Out of the 140 children ever registered, 60 children reached either grade 7 or 8, and only four boys and one girl reached grade 10.

===Church===
To understand Africville, &quot;you got to know about the church;&quot; the life and heart of the town. The Seaview African United Baptist Church was established at Africville in 1849; it joined with other Black Baptist congregations to establish the African Baptist Association in 1854. The community&#x27;s social life revolved around the church, which was the place of baptisms, weddings, and funerals. Other Black groups came to Africville for Sunday picnics and events. Everything was done through the church, &quot;clubs, youth organizations, ladies&#x27; auxiliary and Bible classes.&quot;

===Hockey===
The Africville Seasides hockey team, of the pioneering Colored Hockey League (1894–1930), won the championship in 1901 and 1902, beating West End Rangers from Prince Edward Island to retain their title in a 3–2 single game victory in February 1902. The team was led by star goaltender William Carvery, his two brothers on the team, along with three Dixon brothers also on the squad.

==Relationship with Halifax==
Throughout its history, Africville was confronted with isolation. The town never received proper roads, health services, water, street lamps or electricity. Residents protested to the city and called for municipal water supply and treatment of sewage, to no avail. The lack of these services had serious adverse health effects on residents. Contamination of the wells was so frequent that residents had to boil their water before using it for drinking or cooking.

From the mid-19th century, the City of Halifax located its least desirable facilities in the Africville area, where the people had little political power and property values were low. A prison was built there in 1853, an infectious disease hospital in 1870, as well as a slaughterhouse, and a depository for fecal waste from nearby Russellville.

In 1958, the city decided to move the town garbage dump and landfill to the Africville area. While the residents knew they could not legally fight this, they illegally salvaged the dump for usable goods. They would get clothes, copper, steel, brass, tin, etc. The dump contributed to the city&#x27;s classifying this area as an official slum.

==Razing==

Scholars have concluded that the razing of Africville was a confluence of &quot;overt and hidden racism, the progressive impulse in favour of racial integration, and the rise of liberal-bureaucratic social reconstruction ideas.&quot;

During the 1940s and 1950s in different parts of Canada, the federal, provincial, and municipal governments were working together for urban renewal, particularly after the Allied victory in World War II: there was energy to redevelop areas classified as slums and relocate the people to new and improved housing. The intent was to redevelop some land for &quot;higher&quot; uses with greater economic return: business and industry. Other notable racialized neighbourhoods razed under the banner of urban renewal include The Ward in Toronto, Rooster Town in Winnipeg, and The Bog in Charlottetown.

Many years earlier, and again in 1947 after a major fire burnt several Africville houses, officials discussed redevelopment and relocation of Africville. But more concrete plans of relocation did not officially emerge until 1961. Stimulated by the &quot;Stephenson Report&quot; of 1957 and the establishment of Halifax&#x27;s Department of Development in 1961, the city proposed relocation of these residents. In 1962, Halifax City Council adopted the relocation proposal unanimously, and the &quot;Rose Report&quot; (publ. 1964) was passed 37/41 in favour of relocation.

===Formal relocation and demolition===
The formal relocation took place mainly from 1964 to 1967. The residents and their belongings were moved by Halifax garbage trucks. This image were long remembered by the people; they took it to represent the degrading way they were treated before, during, and after the move. Many former residents believe that the city council had no plans to turn Africville into an industrial site and that racism was the basis of the community&#x27;s destruction. They believe that the city wanted to remove from Halifax a concentrated group of Black people for whom they had no regard. Because of the city&#x27;s continued negative response to the people of Africville, the community failed to develop, and this failure was then used as a rationale to destroy it.

There were many hardships, suspicion and jealousy that emerged, mostly due to complications of land and ownership claims. Only 14 residents held clear legal titles to their land. Those with no legal rights were given a $500 payment and promised a furniture allowance, social assistance, and public housing units. Young families believed they had enough money to begin a new life, but most of the elderly residents would not budge; they had much more of an emotional connection to their homes. They were filled with grief and felt cheated out of their property. Resistance to eviction became more difficult as residents accepted the buyouts and their homes were demolished.

The city quickly demolished each house as soon as residents moved out. Occasionally the city demolished a house whenever an opportunity presented itself—such as when a resident was in the hospital. On 20 November 1967, the church at Africville was demolished at night to avoid controversy, a year before the city officially possessed the building. There is controversy around the documentation, which shows the church was sold in 1968; the page has been edited by hand to forge the sale as a year earlier. Internal city government documents show the demolition order being sent in 1967, with a claim that the building was dangerous. At the time, it was still in use: residents remember the church being bulldozed in 1967, shortly after the last active service; another service was being planned for the end of the year. It was bulldozed with the vital records of many residents inside, such as birth, marriage, and death records, which could have established chains of custody for land claims.

The last Africville home was demolished on 2 January 1970.

===Aftermath===
After relocation to public housing within the city limits, the residents had new problems: cost of living went up in their new homes, more people were unemployed and without regular incomes, none of the promised employment or education programs were implemented, and the city&#x27;s promises went unfulfilled. &quot;Benefits were so modest as to be virtually irrelevant…within a year and a half this post-relocation program lay in ruins.&quot;

Family strains and debt forced many to rely on public assistance, and anxiety was high among the former residents. One of the big complaints was that &quot;they feel no sense of ownership or pride in the sterile public housing projects.&quot;

==Post-razing legacy==
Part of the former territory of Africville is occupied by a highway interchange that serves the A. Murray MacKay Bridge. The port development at Fairview Cove did not extend as far east as Africville, leaving its historic waterfront intact.

In light of the controversy related to the relocation, the city of Halifax created the Seaview Memorial Park on the site in the 1980s, preserving it from development. The park was most often used as an off-leash dog park. Eddie Carvery has been living on the Africville site since 1970 in protest of the razing despite city officials seizing his trailers several times. Likewise, former Africville residents carried out periodic protests at the park throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

The Africville Genealogy Society was formed in 1983 to track former residents and their descendants. Halifax mayor Peter Kelly offered land, some money, and various other services for a replica of the Seaview African United Baptist Church. After the offer was made in 2002, the Africville Genealogy Society requested some alterations to the Halifax offer, including additional land and the possibility of building affordable housing near the site. The area that once was Africville was thereby declared a national historic site in 2002.

===Africville apology===

In May 2005, New Democratic Party of Nova Scotia MLA Maureen MacDonald introduced a bill in the provincial legislature called the &quot;Africville Act&quot;. The bill called for a formal apology from the Nova Scotia government, a series of public hearings on the destruction of Africville, and the establishment of a development fund to go towards historical preservation of Africville lands and social development in benefit of former residents and their descendants.

On 23 February 2010, the Halifax Council ratified a proposed Africville apology, with an arrangement with the Government of Canada to establish a $250,000 Africville Heritage Trust to design a museum and build a replica of the community church. The dedicated site was a area. On 24 February 2010, Halifax Mayor Peter Kelly made the Africville Apology, apologizing for the eviction as part of a $4.5 million compensation deal. The City restored the name Africville to Seaview Park at the annual Africville Family Reunion on 29 July 2011.

====Africville Museum====
A building designed to mimic the Seaview African United Baptist Church, demolished in 1969, was erected in the summer of 2011 to serve as a museum and historic interpretation centre. The nearly complete church was ceremonially opened on 25 September 2011. The opening ceremonies included a gospel concert, several church services, and the release of a compilation audio album with archival recordings of songs sung in Africville.

Since then, the museum has given tours of the site, put on a number of exhibits, commissioned a play about the beginnings of Africville, and organized a number of fundraisers and petitions, including to add a transit stop at and accessibility improvements to the museum. The Africville Museum continues to have problems with area use, including local residents who continue to use Seaview Park as a dog park and vandals who are putting graffiti on signs and disrupting trust efforts to identify the sites of former houses.

A civil lawsuit has been filed seeking individual compensation for property in Africville.

<text>Abul-Ma&#x27;ānī Mīrzā Abdul-Qādir Bēdil (, or Bīdel, ), also known as Bedil Dehlavī (; 1642–1720) and Bedil Azimabadi, was an Indian Sufi, and considered one of the greatest Indo-Persian poets, next to Amir Khusrau, who lived most of his life during the reign of Aurangzeb, the sixth Mughal emperor. He was the foremost representative of the later phase of the Indian style of Persian poetry, and the most difficult and challenging poet of that school.

== Life==
Bedil was born in Azimabad (present-day Patna) in India to Mirza Abd al-Khaliq (d. 1648), a former Turkic soldier who belonged to the Barlas tribe of the Chaghatay. The descendants of the family had originally lived in the city of Bukhara in Transoxiana, before moving to India. Bedil&#x27;s native language was Bengali, but he also spoke Urdu (then known as &quot;rikhta&quot;), Sanskrit and Turkic, as well as Persian and Arabic, which he learned in elementary school.

Bedil mostly wrote Ghazal and Rubayee (quatrain) in Persian, the language of the Royal Court, which he had learned during his childhood. He was the author of 16 books of poetry, which contained nearly 147,000 verses and included several masnavi in that language. He is considered one of the prominent poets of &quot;Indian School of Poetry&quot; in Persian literature, and is regraded as having his own unique style. Both Mirza Ghalib and Iqbal-i Lahori were influenced by him. His books include &quot;Tilism-i Hairat&quot; (طلسم حيرت), &quot;Tur i Ma&#x27;rifat&quot; (طور معرفت), &quot;Chahār Unsur&quot; (چهار عنصر) and &quot;Ruqa&#x27;āt&quot; (رقعات).

Possibly as a result of being brought up in such a mixed religious environment, Bedil had considerably more tolerant views than his poetic contemporaries. He preferred free thought to accepting the established beliefs of his time, siding with the common people and rejecting the clergy who he often saw as corrupt.

Bedil&#x27;s work is highly regarded in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Pakistan. Bedil came back to prominence in Iran in 1980s. Literary critics Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani and Shams Langrudi were instrumental in Bedil&#x27;s re-emergence in Iran. Iran also sponsored two international conferences on Bedil.

The Indian school of Persian poetry, especially Bedil&#x27;s poetry, is criticised for its complex and implicit meanings. As a result, However, it better regarded in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan and India than in Iran. In Afghanistan, a unique school in poetry studying is dedicated to Bīdel&#x27;s poetry called &quot;Bedilšināsī&quot; (Bedil studies), and those who have studied his poetry are called &quot;Bedilšinās&quot; (Bedil experts). His poetry plays a major role in Indo-Persian classical music in central Asia. Many Afghan classical musicians (e.g. Mohammad Hussain Sarahang and Nashenas) have sung Bedil&#x27;s ghazals.

== Grave ==
His grave, called &quot;Bāġ-e Bedil&quot; (Garden of Bedil) is situated across Purana Qila, at Mathura Road next to the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium gates and the pedestrian bridge over Mathura Road in Delhi.

<text>Charles Clark Stevenson (February 20, 1826 – September 21, 1890) was an American politician who was the fifth Governor of Nevada. He was a member of the Republican Party.

==Biography==
Stevenson was born on February 20, 1826, in Phelps, New York. His education was from the common schools of Canada and Michigan. He married Margaret M. Rogers in November 1848 and they had two sons, Edward and Lou. They were divorced in 1880 in Virginia City, Storey County, Nevada. He then married Ellen Mary Frary on June 20, 1881, in San Francisco, San Francisco County, California.

==Career==
In 1859 Stevenson arrived in Ophir (later Virginia City), Nevada, where he worked in mining, milling, and agriculture. He became part-owner of the Cooper and Stevenson quartz mine.

Stevenson was elected to Nevada Senate representing Storey County, serving three terms. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1872 and 1884. Elected Regent of the University of Nevada, he served in that position for 11 years from 1875 to 1887.

Stevenson was elected Governor in 1886, and served to 1890. During his tenure, programs were established which supported livestock and farming industries, the Stewart Indian School was created, and the University of Nevada was reconstructed. His brother, Edward A. Stevenson, was Governor of Idaho at the same time.

==Death==
Stevenson died of typhoid fever while in office on September 21, 1890, in Carson City, Nevada, at the age of 64. That made him the first Nevada Governor to die while in office. He is interred at Mountain View Cemetery.
