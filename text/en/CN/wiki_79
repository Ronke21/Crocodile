<text>Anthony John Pierzynski (; born December 30, 1976) is an American former professional baseball player and current television sports presenter. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher with the Minnesota Twins (1998–2003), San Francisco Giants (2004), Chicago White Sox (2005–2012), Texas Rangers (2013), Boston Red Sox (2014), St. Louis Cardinals (2014) and Atlanta Braves (2015–2016). Pierzynski is one of only thirteen catchers in Major League history to reach 2,000 hits in his career.

A two-time All-Star player and a Silver Slugger Award winner, Pierzynski was a member of the 2005 World Series winning White Sox team. He is known for having a strong and colorful personality, a fact he acknowledges. During his turn at the microphone following the White Sox victory parade in 2005, he thanked team personnel for &quot;putting up&quot; with him. Former White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén summed up the situation by saying, &quot;If you play against him, you hate him. If you play with him, you hate him a little less.&quot; Guillén also acknowledged Pierzynski&#x27;s value to the club despite being relatively high-maintenance: &quot;A.J.&#x27;s been great for me. He&#x27;s worth the work because he always shows up for you.&quot;

==Early life==
Pierzynski was born on December 30, 1976, in Bridgehampton, New York. He attended Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Florida, where he won All-State honors in baseball. Future Major Leaguer Johnny Damon was one of Pierzynski&#x27;s high school teammates. The National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame held its 48th Annual Induction Banquet in September 2021, inducting Pierzynski.

==Professional career==

===Minnesota Twins===
Pierzynski graduated from high school in 1994 and signed a letter of intent to play baseball at the University of Tennessee. He was also selected by the Minnesota Twins in the third round (71st overall) of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft and chose to sign with the ballclub on June 9. He began his minor league career with the Gulf Coast League Twins and spent the next four years playing for the minor-league Elizabethton Twins, Fort Wayne Wizards, Fort Myers Miracle, New Britain Rock Cats, and Salt Lake Buzz.

After four years in the Twins organization, Pierzynski was called up to the major league team, and made his debut on September 9, 1998, against the Anaheim Angels at the age of 21. Two days later, he singled off Oakland Athletics pitcher Billy Taylor for his first major league hit. He then spent the next five seasons, through the 2003 season, with Minnesota, though he was not a regular starter until 2001. From 1998 to 2000, Pierzynski appeared in just 49 games for the Twins. In 2002, he made the American League All-Star Team as a reserve catcher. In the 2002 American League Division Series, Pierzynski hit an important home run in the ninth inning of Game 5 against the Athletics, helping the Twins clinch the series. In 2003, Pierzynski batted a career-high .312 with 11 home runs and 74 RBI in 137 games.

===San Francisco Giants===
On November 14, 2003, the Twins traded Pierzynski to the San Francisco Giants for Joe Nathan, Francisco Liriano, and Boof Bonser. With the Giants, he hit .272 with 11 home runs and 77 RBI in 131 games. He spent one season in San Francisco before being non-tendered on December 15, 2004.

===Chicago White Sox===
Pierzynski was signed as a free agent to a one-year, $2.25 million contract by the Chicago White Sox on January 6, 2005. When he signed with the White Sox, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; ran a story claiming that the catcher had kneed Giants trainer Stan Conte in the groin during a spring training game in 2004. Although the incident allegedly happened during the game, it went unreported for nearly a year in the press. Pierzynski has disputed the allegations publicly. &quot;Don&#x27;t you think if something like that happened, in spring training, you would have heard about it? I would have gotten in some sort of trouble?&quot;

Pierzynski would hit 18 home runs, a new career high, with his most memorable home run of the regular season coming on June 18, 2005, against the Los Angeles Dodgers (with both teams wearing their 1959 throwback jerseys to commemorate their meeting in the 1959 World Series) in the bottom of the ninth to walk-off a 5–3 win. He would also set the single-season AL records for consecutive errorless games (117) and chances (777) by a catcher. The White Sox would go wire-to-wire in Pierzynski&#x27;s first season with the team, winning the AL Central on September 29, 2005, over the Detroit Tigers. However, Pierzynski&#x27;s biggest contributions would come during the White Sox&#x27; 2005 playoff run.

In the 2005 playoffs, Pierzynski was a major player for the White Sox. In Game 1 of the ALDS against the defending champion Red Sox, Pierzynski would start the White Sox off strong with a three-run homer in the first inning off Matt Clement. He would add a second home run in the bottom of the eighth off Bronson Arroyo to help lead the White Sox to a 14–2 win. Pierzynski finished the game 3-for-3 with 4 RBIs. Pierzynski also hit a double and scored an insurance run in the top of the ninth inning as the White Sox defeated the Red Sox 5–3 to clinch the series and move on to the ALCS. Perhaps Pierzynski&#x27;s biggest and most well-known play came in Game 2 of the ALCS against the then Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Down 0–1 in the series and with the game tied at 1–1 in the bottom of the ninth inning, Pierzynski famously struck out on a low ball in the dirt from Kelvim Escobar. Thinking they had ended the inning, the Angels proceeded to walk off the field; however, noting that home plate umpire Doug Eddings had not made the out call, Pierzynski ran down the line to first base and was called safe. Angels catcher Josh Paul and manager Mike Scioscia argued with Eddings but the call stood, and Pierzynski was replaced by Pablo Ozuna, who promptly stole second base. Joe Crede would end the game on a walk-off double to tie the series at 1–1. The White Sox did not lose again, winning the next three games in Anaheim to advance to their first World Series since 1959. The White Sox would then sweep the Houston Astros to win their first championship in 88 years, as Pierzynski won the World Series the only time in his career. Pierzynski batted .262 with three home runs and 9 RBI, catching all 11 games for the White Sox during their championship run.

In 2006, Pierzynski continued his errorless streak, ending with 962 consecutive chances and breaking the AL record of 950 set by Yogi Berra in 1959. (The new record would later be broken by Mike Redmond.) He was named one of the five American League players in the All-Star Final Vote. Soon afterwards, the White Sox organization began an election campaign using the slogan &quot;Punch A.J.&quot;. Pierzynski received 3.6 million votes, the most votes in the American League, subsequently sending him to his second All-Star appearance. The &quot;Punch A.J.&quot; campaign was inspired by an incident on May 20, 2006, between Pierzynski and Chicago Cubs catcher Michael Barrett. After a fly ball out, Pierzynski tagged up at third base and tried to score on the throw. After a collision at home, where Pierzynski knocked Barrett from his feet, Pierzynski slapped home plate with his hand. After getting up, Barrett grabbed Pierzynski and punched him in the face. A bench-clearing brawl ensued, and Pierzynski, Barrett, White Sox outfielder Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman John Mabry were ejected. When play finally resumed, outfielder Scott Podsednik promptly got on base, loading the bases up, and second baseman Tadahito Iguchi cleared them with a grand-slam. The White Sox won the game, 7–0. Barrett was suspended for 10 games, while Anderson was suspended for five, and Pierzynski was fined.

Pierzynski caught Mark Buehrle&#x27;s no-hitter on April 18, 2007, but not his perfect game on July 23, 2009. He caught Philip Humber&#x27;s perfect game on April 21, 2012, against the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field, as well. On May 28, 2007, in a game versus the Minnesota Twins, Pierzynski twice ran down the first base line with his feet on the inside of the base, possibly nipping Twins first baseman Justin Morneau with his spikes. Twins manager Ron Gardenhire was furious with the umpires, which resulted in a long tirade. However, he was not ejected. Pierzynski denied any attempt to step on Morneau.

On September 29, 2007, Pierzynski signed a two-year, $12.5 million contract extension with the White Sox.

On December 3, 2010, Pierzynski agreed to a two-year, $8 million contract to remain with the White Sox.

On June 13, 2012, Pierzynski was rated the most hated MLB player. In 2012, Pierzynski homered in five consecutive games, tying the franchise record and becoming the sixth player to achieve this feat. His teammate Paul Konerko was the most recent Sox player to achieve this feat in 2011. Pierzynski had a career offensive year, winning a Silver Slugger Award at catcher for the first time in his career. He posted a slash line of .278/.326/.501, and hit 27 home runs and 77 RBI in 135 games.

===Texas Rangers===
On December 26, 2012, Pierzynski agreed to a one-year, $7.5 million contract with the Texas Rangers for the 2013 season. He enjoyed a solid year for Texas, hitting .272 with 17 home runs and 70 RBIs in 134 games.

===Boston Red Sox===
On December 3, 2013, Pierzynski agreed to a one-year contract with the Boston Red Sox, pending the completion of a physical examination. The deal became official the next day. On June 4, 2014, Pierzynski was ejected by umpire Quinn Wolcott after a leadoff walk by pitcher Brandon Workman because he asked Wolcott to &quot;give me a new ball. One you can see.&quot; This was Pierzynski&#x27;s ninth career ejection. Pierzynski&#x27;s offense regressed with Boston as he hit .254/.286/.348 in 256 at-bats.

On July 9, 2014, Pierzynski was designated for assignment and Christian Vázquez was promoted from AAA Pawtucket. A sports column in a Boston newspaper cited disgruntled anonymous Red Sox teammates who disliked Pierzynski, blaming him for the team&#x27;s overall woes. On July 16, the Red Sox officially released Pierzynski. The Red Sox continued a disastrous slide after Pierzynski departed, and finished 2014 with a record of 71–91.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
On July 26, 2014, the St. Louis Cardinals signed Pierzynski to a major league deal. Later that day, he debuted for St. Louis with a 3-for-4 outing and an RBI, helping to defeat the Cubs 6–3. Former Boston teammate John Lackey soon arrived via trade, and Pierzynski caught him for the 19th time in 22 starts in 2014 when he debuted for the Cardinals on August 3. It was the pitcher&#x27;s 150th career win. Pierzynski&#x27;s first home run with St. Louis came in a loss to Baltimore on August 8. He hit .244/.295/.305 in 82 at-bats along with a home run and 6 RBI. He mostly serving as a replacement catcher for Yadier Molina, who was on the disabled list from July 10 through August 28, though he did play as a backup after Molina&#x27;s return. The Cardinals left Pierzynski off the playoff roster for the NLDS against the Dodgers, but added him for the NLCS against the Giants.

===Atlanta Braves===

Pierzynski and the Atlanta Braves finalized a one-year deal worth $2 million on January 7, 2015. The Braves had intended to use him as a backup catcher and mentor to Christian Bethancourt. However, Bethancourt struggled defensively and was eventually sent down to Gwinnett in the hope that he would improve, forcing Pierzynski into a starting role. On July 18, 2015, in a game against the Chicago Cubs, Pierzynski broke up Jon Lester&#x27;s no-hit bid in the eighth inning of the Braves&#x27; 4–0 loss.

On April 27, 2016, Pierzynski recorded his 2,000th career hit off Steven Wright of the Boston Red Sox, becoming the tenth catcher to reach the 2,000 hit mark. He was placed on 15-day disabled list on August 17, 2016. On March 28, 2017, Pierzynski announced he was retiring.

Pierzynski was included on the ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame class of when it was announced on November 22, 2021. He received only two votes and fell off the ballot.

==Broadcasting career==

Pierzynski was hired by Fox to be an analyst for the 2011 MLB postseason on the pregame and postgame show. He joined Fox again for the 2012, 2013, and 2015 postseasons. In 2017, Fox announced he would be a full-time analyst.

==Professional wrestling==
On December 8, 2005, Pierzynski appeared on &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, a professional wrestling television program aired by the professional wrestling promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Accompanied by White Sox strength trainer Dale Torborg, Pierzynski presented TNA wrestlers A.J. Styles, Chris Sabin and Sonjay Dutt with memorabilia from the 2005 World Series. At the ceremony, an incident was staged to include Pierzynski in a controversy with the wrestlers. Pierzynski then made his professional wrestling managerial debut at TNA Turning Point 2005 on December 11, 2005, accompanying Torborg, Sabin and Dutt to ringside for their match against the Diamonds in the Rough.

On October 10, 2006, Pierzynski appeared on ESPN2&#x27;s Cold Pizza, wearing the X-Division Championship belt, and challenged WWE Champion John Cena, who was also a guest that morning, to a Title vs. Title steel cage match whenever Cena wanted to have it. Cena responded asking if Pierzynski got his championship belt out of a gumball machine outside.

Pierzynski returned to TNA in January 2007, when he and Torborg confronted Lance Hoyt. At TNA Against All Odds (2007) Pierzynski was in Torborg&#x27;s corner when he was defeated by Hoyt, who had David Eckstein in his corner.

On the September 7, 2009, edition of WWE Raw, Pierzynski made his first appearance on WWE television, replacing Chris Jericho in a game show called The Price is Raw, with Bob Barker hosting.

==Personal life==
Pierzynski is married to Lisa Pierzynski. The couple has two children, Ava and Austin.

AJ is a main host on the Foul Territory Podcast with Erik Kratz and Scott Braun. He is known for his blunt takes and his fun banter with senior insider Ken Rosenthal.

<text>Central New Mexico Community College (CNM), formerly Technical Vocational Institute (TVI), is a public community college based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Founded in 1964, CNM offers associate degrees, professional certificates, and training options.

CNM has the largest undergraduate student enrollment in the state and is located across several campuses and training sites in the Albuquerque metropolitan area. As of Fall 2018, CNM had 21,398 students and 18,000 individuals enrolled in non-credit workforce training, industry testing for credentials/licensures and adult basic education.

==History==

Following authorization by the New Mexico Legislature in 1963, CNM (then TVI) was approved by district voters in 1964 to provide adults with skills to gain employment and succeed. The college opened on July 1, 1965, at the site of where its Main Campus stands.

TVI was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1978 and given degree-granting power by the State Legislature in 1986, at which point TVI became a community college. In 2006, TVI changed its name to Central New Mexico Community College.

Today, CNM is the largest higher education institution in New Mexico based on enrollment. The college has many transfer articulation agreements with four-year institutions around the state, including the University of New Mexico.

==Governance and funding==
CNM&#x27;s Governing Board consists of seven members elected to four-year terms from districts within the overall College district. The Governing Board is responsible for policies that govern all phases of the educational programs at the college.

CNM funding comes from a property tax levy in the college&#x27;s service district, as well as appropriations by the New Mexico Legislature.

<doc id="1257415" wikidata="Q1910946" url="?curid=1257415" title="Matías Vuoso">
<text>Vicente José Matías Vuoso (born 3 November 1981) is a former professional footballer who played as a striker. Born in Argentina, he played for the Mexico national team.

Born in Mar del Plata, Vuoso began his career at Independiente in 2000, then transferring to English club Manchester City in 2002, where he did not play in a single league match. Since 2003 he has played in Mexico, having two stints with Santos Laguna and Club América, as well as playing for Atlas and Chiapas.

Vuoso chose to represent Mexico at international level, making his debut in 2008 and featured for them at the 2015 Copa América.

== Club career ==

=== Early career ===

Matías Vuoso began his career in the Argentine Primera División with Independiente. Playing alongside Diego Forlán, Vicente scored seven goals in 29 games for Independiente in 2000–01 and another seven in 35 games in 2001–02. He left the Argentinian club in June 2002 to sign with English club Manchester City, joining for £3.5 million. However, Vuoso did not appear in a single game for Manchester City, and was subsequently loaned out to Santos Laguna for the 2003–04 season.

===Santos Laguna===

Despite moving from the Premier League to the Primera Division Mexicana, in the beginning of his stay in Mexico, Vuoso experienced the same problems at Santos Laguna that he faced at Manchester City. Coming to a club that already boasted an attack that featured Chilean playmaker Rodrigo Ruiz and Mexican striker Jared Borgetti, Vuoso was exclusively played as a substitute during the first part of the Apertura 2003 season. As fate would have it however, Vuoso was thrown into the starting mix when Borgetti suffered a minor injury that required a two-week absence from the pitch. Vuoso scored in both of the games he started in place of Borgetti and subsequently convinced Santos manager Luis Fernando Tena, who awarded Vuoso a starting spot.

After Jared Borgetti&#x27;s exit from Santos Laguna following the Clausura 2004 season, Vuoso became Santos Laguna&#x27;s main goalscoring threat and teammate Rodrigo Ruiz&#x27;s primary target for his passes. Vuoso exploded with 11 goals in 17 games for Santos in the Apertura 2004 campaign and then followed that up with 16 goals in 19 games the following season.

===América===

Newly appointed América manager Luis Fernando Tena brought Vuoso to the club as a reinforcement for the Apertura 2006 campaign. Following the club&#x27;s semi-final defeat, Vuoso was sold back to Santos. He only managed to score 5 goals in 20 league matches for América.

===Return to Santos Laguna===

Vuoso was bought by Santos Laguna again after Clausura 2007 for an undisclosed amount of money. Upon his return, a loss of form kept Vuoso on the bench. However, Vuoso would later become a key player in Santos Laguna&#x27;s 2008 Clausura championship campaign.

However, during the finals of the Clausura 2010, he failed to score twice in two important plays during the second game against Toluca and made that Santos were meant to play extra-time and penalty shots. In the penalty shots he was the fourth player and failed to score his penalty shot allowing Toluca to get the championship.

After this game, Vuoso was transferred to Club America.

===Return to América===

For the Apertura 2010 season, he signed with América, which would be his second stint with the club. In his first season with América, he scored 8 goals, helping América reach the semi-finals, being defeated by his ex-club Santos.

===Atlas===

América sold Vuoso to Atlas de Guadalajara for the Apertura 2012 tournament. He scored 10 goals in over 50 matches played with Atlas.

====Loan to Chiapas====

Atlas loaned Vuoso to Chiapas F.C. for the Apertura 2014.

===Cruz Azul===
On 25 July 2015, Cruz Azul announced the signing of Vuoso for the Apertura 2015. During this time, Vuoso was a free agent.

== International career ==

Upon receiving his Mexican citizenship, Vuoso said that if Hugo Sánchez, former coach of the Mexico national team, ever needed a striker, he would be honored to wear the green jersey while helping the country of his new home win. On 3 August 2008 Mexico coach and former Manchester City manager Sven-Göran Eriksson had Matias Vuoso, the second naturalized striker on the Mexico squad, replace Omar Arellano who injured himself days before. His debut came when he came on as a substitute in a 3–0 win over Jamaica at the Azteca stadium.

On 15 October 2008, Vuoso scored his first goal with the team against Canada with a header. The game was a World Cup Qualifier Match. On 12 November 2008, Vuoso scored a last minute goal for Mexico to win over Ecuador 2–1. On 11 March 2009, he scored again twice against Bolivia, in a game that ended 5–1.

On 11 May 2015, Vuoso was called up to participate in the 2015 Copa América. He would make world football headlines by scoring a memorable brace in what was a surprising tie against Chile whom were the eventual Copa America winners.

=== International goals ===

== Personal life ==
During his time with Manchester City, he, along with players Daniel Van Buyten and Djamel Belmadi, were the victim of a theft by two bankers. In total, workers at the Co-operative Bank stole more than £350,000 from the accounts of the three players. In January 2006, the bank workers, Paul Sherwood, a cashier, and Paul Hanley, his supervisor, were jailed for 32 months and 12 months respectively.

<text>The power station Berlin-Wilmersdorf was a power plant in Berlin-Schmargendorf, which went into service in 1977, and has been shut down in 2021.

Construction of the facility, which belongs to the BEWAG, started in 1973.

At the time of construction, the three power engines are MS9001B gas turbines, manufactured in Belfort (France) by a cooperation between Alsthom and General Electric.

It has three blocks with a power of 110 megawatts, each equipped with a chimney. This very striking facility received an architectural prize in the 1980s. It is not located near a river and therefore must take its cooling water from underground. There was an explosion on January 2, 1992, in one of the blocks. It is run by Vattenfall Europe, a subdivision of Vattenfall.

<text>Rohrau () is a village in the state of Lower Austria. The name comes from two German words: &quot;Rohr&quot; (reed) and &quot;Au&quot; (riparian forest). South of the village is a riparian forest and a swamp covered with reed.

Rohrau is located in the &quot;industrial quarter&quot; (&quot;Industrieviertel&quot;) of Lower Austria. Its area is 20.50 km2, of which 8.38% is forested. There is a kindergarten and a primary school (&quot;Volksschule&quot;). It is the birthplace of the composer Joseph Haydn who was born there on 31 March 1732.

==Subdivisions==
Rohrau is subdivided into the following &quot;Katastralgemeinden&quot;:
*Rohrau
*Gerhaus
*Hollern
*Pachfurth

==History==
The area in pre-Roman times belonged to the Celtic kingdom of Noricum. In Roman Times, the area was part of the Roman province of Pannonia Superior; Rohrau is near to Carnuntum, a former Roman army camp close to the village of Petronell-Carnuntum. Rohrau grew along an old road next to the river Leitha connecting Carnuntum to the bridge crossing the river at Bruck an der Leitha, the current district capital.
In the Middle Ages, a castle was built, surrounded by a moat; later it was converted to a chateau. Its facade as seen today is in the &quot;Josephinian Style&quot;, a late and very rare Baroque style that only was used during the reign of Emperor Joseph II in the late 18th century. The chateau (Schloss Rohrau) has been owned by the Counts of Harrach and their descendants since 1524, and it contains the largest private collection of Dutch oil paintings in Austria.

In the 16th century, Rohrau was given the right to hold a market, thus becoming a Market town.

In the early 18th century, the town was plagued by attacks from the &quot;Kuruczes&quot;, described by Geiringer as &quot;the peasant army of the anti-Habsburg Hungarian party&quot;. In 1704, they plundered the town and burned homes, returning to do the same in 1706; a further attack took place in 1707. A resident who lost his house to the flames in both 1704 and 1706 was Lorenz Koller (born 1675), who was the Marktrichter (roughly, mayor) of the town and the maternal grandfather of Joseph Haydn (see below).

===Rohrau as former border town===
Rohrau stands in close proximity to the neighbouring state of Burgenland, which was part of Hungary until 1921. Rohrau once had a border checkpoint at the bridge crossing the river to what was then the Hungarian part of the Austrian Empire. This checkpoint, which now is a farmhouse, was only an internal border crossing, and the local noble family Harrach, in fact, owned land on both sides.

===Rohrau and Haydn===

The composer Joseph Haydn was born in Rohrau in 1732. His father Mathias was a master wheelwright who served as &quot;Marktrichter&quot; of the village; something akin to mayor. His mother had previously worked as a cook in the Harrach household. Haydn lived in Rohrau only until about 1738, when he was sent away to attend a boarding school in nearby Hainburg.

The composer&#x27;s birth home, which is also the birth home of his brother Michael Haydn, is today a museum; it only partially reflects its original form since it has been repeatedly restored following fires and floods. It has also been expanded to serve its purpose as a museum.
A monument to Haydn was erected by Count Karl Leonhard Harrach in 1793, during the composer&#x27;s own lifetime; it is thus the oldest of all Haydn monuments. It was originally placed in the park of Harrach chateau, on an artificial island (the &quot;Haydn-Insel&quot;) in the Leitha River, created for the purpose. The monument was later transferred to the center of the village, where it stands today. When Haydn returned from London in 1795, he visited the monument during an emotional return to his home town.

===Historical population of Rohrau===
*1971: 1,341
*1981: 1,258
*1991: 1,224
*2001: 1,455
*2011: 1,544
*2014: 1,569

==Economy==
As of 2011, there were 47 companies related to agricultural and forestry, and 89 non-agricultural jobs. 791 persons were employed at their place of residence. 43 people were unemployed.

Local agricultural products: sugar beets, wheat, maize/corn, potatoes, sheep, wine.

==Local politics==
The village mayor (Bürgermeister), is Herbert Speckl, Deputy Mayor is Albert Mayer. The &quot;village secretary&quot; (Gemeindesekratär) is Josef Rössler. In 2015 election the seats at the village council, 19 in total, were distributed between the People&#x27;s Party - ÖVP (14) and the Social Democratic Party - SPÖ (5). Traditionally the People&#x27;s Party has a stronghold in Lower Austria, due to the support they get from farmers and white-collar employees.

==Church==

Rohrau is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna. The Catholic priest at the church of St. Vitus is Dr. Norbert Mendecki.

<doc id="1257440" wikidata="Q1063062" url="?curid=1257440" title="Minimo">
<text>Minimo (from &quot;Mini Mozilla&quot;) was a project to create a version of the Mozilla web browser for small devices like personal digital assistants and mobile phones.

The project aimed to make it easier for developers to embed parts of Mozilla into systems with limited system resources (for example, machines with low amounts of RAM).

==Background==

The Minimo Project was created to test the feasibility of porting a full-function desktop browser engine to advanced mobile devices.

To minimize the use of system resources Minimo initially did not include some of Mozilla&#x27;s functionality, such as support for SVG, although continuing experiments sought to include all the features of the Mozilla codebase. In addition, the browser used small screen rendering technology to reformat Web pages for pocket-sized displays and allowed a platform for UI experiments on mobile devices. The user interface was designed to take up minimal screen space, with a single 8px high toolbar and a hidden-by-default address bar. Other user interface functionality, such as bookmarks, history, and search, was migrated into a special homepage called the Homebase. Because Minimo is based on the Gecko infrastructure, developers can decide to build specific versions and evaluate other features such as the canvas, SVG support, and more.

Chris Hofmann created the Minimo project shortly after leaving Netscape Communications in 2003, under funding from Nokia&#x27;s Maemo team. He single-handedly saved the project from being canceled many times. Currently Chris works for the Mozilla Corporation. Chris was also responsible for some of the Minimo key features such as the Homebase bar, a format for displaying bookmarks more amenable to mobile devices.

Early Minimo development centered on ARM devices (such as Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s iPAQ) with around 64MB of RAM, running Familiar Linux and the GPE Palmtop Environment (where it was the default browser). Minimo 0.1 was released for this platform in 2004.

The lead Minimo developer, Doug Turner, headed this and additional Mozilla mobile projects such as the Mozilla labs project named Joey. The Mozilla Foundation hired Turner in December 2004 to work full-time on Mobile projects. Minimo was funded by Nokia and others. Nokia&#x27;s involvement became public in mid-2004. Chris and Doug teamed up with web developer Marcio Galli as he focused in user interface aspects and mostly creating built in applications for Minimo using HTML instead of XUL — these were refereed in the source code as extensions but served as concept for web-based mobile apps featuring Flickr, Google Maps, and more.
A Windows CE version of Minimo was created for Pocket PC 2003 software development kit. The first public build of Minimo for Windows CE was made available in February 2005.

In June 2006, the 0.16 release of minimo included tabs, a &quot;homebase bar&quot; for fast navigation to frequently used web sites, and featured support for many advanced web development capabilities that made the mobile browser easier to use.

On December 17, 2006, Turner, in his blog, acknowledged the slow pace of development, and revealed that Mozilla developers were exploring alternatives for Gecko-based web browsing on mobile handsets. Turner issued an invitation for others to &quot;step up&quot; as his own development priorities shift.

Version 0.2 came out in March 2007 and represented a product targeted for mobile developers. Minimo 0.2 included and upgraded interface, and support for Windows Mobile 5.

On November 27, 2007, project head Doug Turner announced that the project was no longer supported.

By 2008 Doug Turner had begun on yet another mobile web browser, this time known as Firefox Mobile or Fennec.

==Criticism==
Probably because it was in the early stages of development, the Windows Mobile version of Minimo performed significantly slower than expected.

The quality of rendered pages is congruent with the well-respected layout engine it implemented (Gecko), but the program had very high memory and hardware requirements compared to what was typically available on most handheld platforms (e.g. 64 megabytes of RAM, 206–624 MHz ARM-compatible CPU).

Version 0.2 was recommended for developers targeting mobile devices or interested in AJAX- and Web Services-driven Web application for the mobile space. Minimo was compatible with many Web 2.0 applications, such as Gmail.

<doc id="1257451" wikidata="Q503165" url="?curid=1257451" title="Luciano Figueroa">
<text>Luciano Gabriel&quot;Lucho&quot;Figueroa Herrera (; born 19 May 1981) is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a striker.

==Club career==
Figueroa was born in Santa Fe. He began his professional career with Primera División club Rosario Central, where he formed a partnership with César Delgado. In the 2003 Clausura, Figueroa finished as Argentina&#x27;s leading goalscorer with 17 goals, which included five in the last match of the season against an under-strength Boca Juniors. This was his last season at Rosario Central. Both he and Delgado transferred overseas in the summer of 2003; Figueroa joined English Premier League club Birmingham City for a fee of £2.5 million.

Controversy arose when Spanish club Osasuna claimed that Figueroa had signed a contract with them before his move to Birmingham, thereby invalidating the transfer. At the end of August 2003 FIFA ruled provisionally in Birmingham&#x27;s favour, but it was not until October that this ruling was finally confirmed. Figueroa had been close to joining Rangers earlier that summer but the Glasgow club pulled out of the deal.

Though Figueroa was scoring freely for Birmingham&#x27;s reserve team, manager Steve Bruce believed he would struggle in the Premiership due to his physique. After only one League appearance, as a late substitute in a 2–0 defeat of Portsmouth, and one outing in the League Cup, his contract was annulled, and he signed for Cruz Azul of the Primera División de México, where he was reunited with former teammate Delgado.

After a slow start, Figueroa returned to his old form with Cruz Azul, scoring 9 goals in the last 7 games of the 2004 Clausura. He maintained his form in the 2004 Apertura, scoring 10 goals in 14 games for the club.

===Villarreal===
His exceptional performances for Cruz Azul led to a transfer to Spain, where he signed a five-and-a-half-year contract with Villarreal in November 2004. The transfer fee was officially undisclosed, but was estimated in the media as €3 million.

Figueroa made less of an impact at Villarreal. Even so, he helped the club to a third-place finish in La Liga in the 2004–05 season, and scored their first ever Champions League goal, against Everton in the third qualifying round of the 2005–06 competition, but had left the club by the time they reached the semi-final.

In January 2006, apparently concerned that his lack of playing time would adversely affect his chances of selection for Argentina at the 2006 World Cup, Figueroa returned to his home country. He joined River Plate, who bought 50% of the rights to the player. He started well there, scoring three goals in his first seven games of the 2006 Clausura, but on 5 March 2006 he suffered a cruciate ligament injury which effectively put an end to his career with River.

===Genoa===
On 1 August 2006, Villarreal sold Figueroa to Genoa of Serie B for a reported $13 million fee. He signed a four-year contract with the club. Though still not fully recovered from his injury, medical opinion was that Figueroa should have been able to play again by mid-October. However it became clear that the knee reconstruction had not been completely successful and that another operation would be needed. It was predicted that this further surgery would keep him from playing that season.

Figueroa eventually made his debut for Genoa, by this time in Serie A, on 28 October 2007 as a second-half substitute against Fiorentina, and scored his first goal for the club some six weeks later, a stoppage-time consolation in a 3–1 defeat at home to Siena.

Figueroa was loaned from Genoa to Boca Juniors in October 2008. He played an important role during the Torneo Apertura by scoring important goals as the title race was between Boca Juniors, Tigre and San Lorenzo, who were level on points at the top of the table. Eventually, Figueroa&#x27;s performances helped Boca to win the Torneo Apertura.

===Rosario Central===
After Genoa released the player, he returned to his first club, Rosario Central. After passing a medical examination on his knee, he signed a two-and-a-half-year contract on 20 January 2010.

===Panathinaikos===
On 6 February 2013, he was released on a free transfer by Emelec and joined Greek club Panathinaikos until the end of the season. He made his debut in a crucial game against AEK Athens that Panathinaikos won 2–0. On 9 March 2013 he scored his first goal for the Greens, with a successful penalty kick against AO Kerkyra. He scored a goal in an away match against Olympiacos in a match that ended 1–1.

It was reported in June 2013 that Figueroa was to sign for Brazilian Série A side Náutico, but the deal fell through.

On 12 September 2013, Figueroa signed once again with Panathinaikos for one year.

===Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim===
Figueroa signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth $1.5 million annually, with Malaysia Super League team Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim in December 2013. The transfer fee was $1 million. Figueroa scored his first goal in the 88th minute after a through pass from Safiq Rahim to give Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim their first win, 2–0 against Perak FA in the season opener. His previous experiences with clubs in Europe and South America helped Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim to win their first league title in the 2014 season with 11 league goals (22 goals overall).

On 22 August 2015, he won his second league title with Johor. On 31 October 2015, Figueroa won the club&#x27;s first ever AFC Cup title after defeating Istiklol 1–0 in the final.

After his playing contract with Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim ended in 2015, Figueroa decided to retire as a football player. In 2017, he returned to become the new Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim football club ambassador, and came out of retirement in November of that year to play for Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim in the 2018 Malaysia Super League. In May 2018, he returned to his ambassadorial role and retired again as a professional football player. In August 2018, Figueroa was appointed as the team manager of Johor Darul Ta&#x27;zim. Club owner Tunku Ismail Ibrahim later also announced Figueroa as head coach of JDT, with JDT II head coach Benjamin Mora as his assistant.

==International career==

Figueroa has appeared for the Argentina national football team while playing for Cruz Azul and Villarreal, performing impressively in the Copa América 2004 and the 2005 Confederations Cup – where only the Brazilian Adriano outscored him – and was part of the gold medal-winning Argentina team at the 2004 Summer Olympics. At international level, he boasts a strike-rate of 60%, with 9 goals from 15 appearances, the same stats as Martín Palermo. The cruciate injury deprived him of the chance to represent his country at the 2006 World Cup.

<doc id="1257455" wikidata="Q7248196" url="?curid=1257455" title="Professor Weston">
<text>Professor Weston (full name Edward Rolles Weston) is a Satanic character in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Space Trilogy&quot;. He is introduced in the trilogy&#x27;s first book, &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; (1938), as an eminent physicist who has invented space travel. He is defeated by the novel&#x27;s protagonist Elwin Ransom on Mars (known to its inhabitants as &quot;Malacandra&quot;). Weston returns in the second book, in an attempt to wreak havoc on Venus (Perelandra), the &quot;new Eden&quot;.

==Imperialism on Malacandra==
In &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, Weston first appears with his accomplice, Dick Devine (the future Lord Feverstone in &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;), attempting to abduct a mentally impaired young man named Harry, whom Weston considers subhuman and disposable. They plan to take him to Malacandra (Mars) as a human sacrifice to Oyarsa, its ruling angel. It is then that they are surprised by a chance visit by Elwin Ransom, the main character of the novel, who is an old schoolmate of Devine. Ransom grows suspicious of their activities, and Devine persuades Weston to abduct Ransom instead.

Shortly after landing on Malacandra, Weston and Devine attempt to drag Ransom to the servants of Oyarsa, but a particular incident distracts them, and Ransom escapes. In the course of his adventures on Malacandra, Ransom learns that the Oyarsa, the being to whom he was supposedly to be sacrificed, wanted only to speak with a human to learn of the conditions on Earth, the &#x27;Silent Planet&#x27;. The &quot;civilized&#x27; Weston cannot understand this, expecting only savagery from &quot;primitive&quot; cultures.

It is eventually revealed that the immediate purpose of Weston&#x27;s and Devine&#x27;s journey to Malacandra is to mine Malacandra&#x27;s abundant gold. This is the only motive of the mercenary Devine, but Weston&#x27;s plan is to open a new age of space colonization to ensure the eternal survival of the human race, an idea borrowed from Stapledon&#x27;s Last and First Men. The seeming humanitarianism of Weston&#x27;s scheme is corrupted by his contemptuous and colonialist attitude towards all other forms of life, including the humane and intelligent Malacandrans.

==Colonising Eden, in the name of Universal Spirit==
In &quot;Perelandra&quot;, the sudden arrival of Weston&#x27;s spaceship on Venus is a great surprise to the self-doubting Ransom, who himself has been sent by an oyarsa to counter a mysterious threat. Weston has undergone a philosophical conversion since his near-death in returning from Mars: he considers his former devotion to the human race as &quot;a mere prejudice&quot;, and now wishes to spread &quot;Spirit ... the blind, inarticulate purposiveness&quot; which drives emergent evolution. In his personal theology, Weston has come to the fatal misunderstanding that God and the Devil are one, and that his great work is guided by this syncretic Spirit. Indeed, Weston calls Ransom to join him, since &quot;nothing now divides you and me except a few outworn theological technicalities with which organised religion has unhappily allowed itself to get incrusted. But I have penetrated that crust.&quot;

But under Ransom&#x27;s probing, Weston&#x27;s new philosophy proves as self-aggrandizing as the old: &quot;In so far as I am the conductor of the central forward pressure of the universe, I &quot;am&quot; it ... I, Weston, am your God and Devil. I call that Force into me completely ...&quot; As he opens his soul, Weston is possessed by the Devil and lost as an independent personality, his frozen features suggesting that &quot;either he was in no pain or in a pain beyond all human comprehension.&quot; Ransom leaves to look for the Lady of Perelandra, and when he returns Weston is gone.

==Death==
When Ransom finds him again, surrounded by ripped-apart frogs, Weston is no longer human: He did not look like a sick man: but he looked very like a dead one.The face which he raised from torturing the frog had that terrible power which the face of a corpse sometimes has of simply rebuffing every conceivable human attitude one can adopt towards it... It looked at Ransom in silence and at last began to smile... The smile was not bitter, nor raging, nor, in an ordinary sense, sinister; it was not even mocking. It seemed to summon Ransom, with a horrible naïveté of welcome, into the world of its own pleasures, as if all men were at one in those pleasures, as if they were the most natural thing in the world and no dispute could ever have occurred about them. It was not furtive, nor ashamed, it had nothing of the conspirator in it. It did not defy goodness, it ignored it to the point of annihilation. Ransom perceived that he had never before seen anything but half-hearted and uneasy attempts at evil. This creature was whole-hearted. The extremity of its evil had passed beyond all struggle into some state which bore a horrible similarity to innocence.The evil spirit possessing Weston works to corrupt the newly created race, subtly tempting the Lady of Perelandra (the new Eve) into disobeying the commands of Maleldil (God), while Ransom pleads with her to resist the Un-man (Ransom&#x27;s name for the possessed Weston). Eventually Ransom, realizing that he cannot defeat the Un-man with argument — and prompted by Maleldil — physically attacks the Un-man, and both are badly wounded in the ensuing fight, but neither can prevail. In an interlude, Weston&#x27;s consciousness appears to resurface, dismaying Ransom with the confused horror of Hell: [Death] is the real universe... That’s what it all &quot;means&quot;... That’s why it’s so important to live as long as you can. All the good things are &quot;now&quot;—a thin little rind of what we call life, put on for show, and then—the &quot;real&quot; universe for ever and ever. To thicken the rind by one centimetre—to live one week, one day, one half-hour longer—that’s the only thing that matters... Picture the universe as an infinite globe with this very thin crust on the outside... We are born on the surface of it and all our lives we are sinking through it. When we’ve got all the way through then we are what’s called Dead: we’ve got into the dark part inside, the real globe. If your God exists, He’s not in the globe ... from His point of view, we move &quot;away&quot;, into what He regards as nonentity, where He never follows. That is all there is to us, all there ever was... Reasoning itself is only valid as long as you stay in the rind. It has nothing to do with the real universe... You try to connect things and can&#x27;t. They take your head off...and you can&#x27;t even look back on what life was like...because you know it never did mean anything even from the beginning.However, it is impossible to distinguish whether anything he says is Weston or the Devil working through him. Indeed, Ransom concludes:

Ransom finally kills Weston in the tunnels beneath Perelandra and rolls his body into a volcanic abyss.

Ransom, having carved a monument to the great physicist into the wall outside the caverns, makes his way up to a mountaintop, to meet the grateful Lady and the King of the new planet.

==Lifespan==
According to Ransom&#x27;s epitaph, Weston lived from 1896 to 1942 (&quot;Perelandra&quot;, chapter 15). However, the notion that he died at the age of 46 conflicts with Weston&#x27;s explanation in Chapter 7 that he had neglected the study of biology &quot;until I reached the fifties&quot;.

==Possible influences==

Weston may be a caricature of Cecil John Rhodes (1853-1902) an English South African businessman and imperialist politician. Like Rhodes, Weston, while supremely capable, is racist, amoral, and rapacious, and hates God and religion. In a passing comment in &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, it is said that Great Britain has produced both heroes and villains, that for every King Arthur, there is a traitor Mordred, for every Sydney (the Renaissance poet), there is a Cecil Rhodes. In &quot;Perelandra&quot;, Weston mentions his liking of the book of which Rhodes said &quot;it made me who I am”: Winwood Reade&#x27;s &quot;The Martyrdom of Man&quot;, which expounded the ideology of secular humanism. Professor Weston may also stand for the scientific elitism that despises all other types of knowledge.

There is a glancing allusion to George Bernard Shaw: Weston&#x27;s speech on Malacandra, like &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot;, ends with the words &quot;It is enough for me that there is a Beyond&quot;, and Weston shares Shaw&#x27;s (and Henri Bergson&#x27;s) belief in the Life Force. Another possible influence is that of Nietzsche&#x27;s, the goal of whose philosophy was the advent of the overman. He may also be based on influential eugenicist J. B. S. Haldane.

Weston is said by Bob Rickard to be similar to the fallen wizard Saruman from J.R.R. Tolkien’s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, although he precedes &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

The choice of the name &quot;Weston&quot; might be more than accidental, considering that in his speech in &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; he presents himself very much as the proponent of &quot;Western Civilization&quot; in its most expansionist and aggressive mode. (The names of the main villains in &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, &quot;Wither&quot; and &quot;Frost&quot;, are clearly meant to reflect their characters.)

<doc id="1257474" wikidata="Q773834" url="?curid=1257474" title="Jaguar D-Type">
<text>The Jaguar D-Type is a sports racing car that was produced by Jaguar Cars Ltd. between 1954 and 1957. Designed specifically to win the Le Mans 24-hour race, it shared the straight-6 XK engine and many mechanical components with its C-Type predecessor. Its structure, however, was radically different, with innovative monocoque construction and slippery aerodynamics that integrated aviation technology, including in some examples a distinctive vertical stabilizer.
Engine displacement began at 3.4 litres, was enlarged to 3.8 L in 1957, and reduced to 3.0 L in 1958 when Le Mans rules limited engines for sports racing cars to that maximum. D-Types won Le Mans in 1955, 1956 and 1957. After Jaguar temporarily retired from racing as a factory team, the company offered the remaining unfinished D-Types as street-legal XKSS versions, whose perfunctory road-going equipment made them eligible for production sports car races in America. In 1957 25 of these cars were in various stages of completion when a factory fire destroyed nine of them.

Total production is thought by some to have totaled 71 D-Types, including 18 for factory teams and 53 for privateers (plus an additional 16 D-Types were converted into road-legal XKSS versions). Jaguar is quoted as claiming it built 75 D-Types.

==Design==


The design applied aeronautical technology, revolutionary at the time. The &quot;tub&quot;, or cockpit section, was of monocoque construction, mostly comprising sheets of aluminium alloy. Its elliptical shape and comparatively small cross-section provided torsional rigidity and reduced drag. To the front bulkhead was attached an aluminium tubing subframe for the engine, steering assembly, and front suspension. Rear suspension and final drive were mounted to the rear bulkhead. Fuel was carried in the tail and the designers followed aviation practice by specifying a deformable Marston Aviation Division bag in place of a conventional tank.

The aerodynamic influence was partly the work of Malcolm Sayer, who had joined Jaguar following a stint with the Bristol Aeroplane Company during the Second World War and later worked on the C-Type. The D-Type required a minimal frontal area. To reduce the XK engine&#x27;s height dry sump lubrication was developed, and it has been said that the car&#x27;s frontal area was also a consideration in canting the engine at 8½° from the vertical (which necessitated the offset bonnet bulge). Philip Porter, in his book &quot;Jaguar Sports Racing Cars&quot;, says that &quot;[a] more likely reason was to provide extra space for the ram pipes feeding the three twin-choke Weber carburettors.&quot; Reducing underbody drag contributed to the car&#x27;s high top speed; for the long Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans, a fin was mounted behind the driver for aerodynamic stability. For the 1955 season, factory cars were fitted with a longer nose, which lengthened the car by 7½ inches and further increased maximum speed; and the headrest fairing and aerodynamic fin were combined as a single unit that smoothed the aerodynamics and saved weight.

Mechanically, many features were shared with the outgoing C-Type. Its front and rear suspension and innovative all-round disc brakes were retained, as was the XK engine. Apart from the new lubrication system, the engine was further revised as development progressed during the D-Type&#x27;s competition life. Notably in 1955, larger valves were introduced, together with asymmetrical cylinder heads to accommodate them.

Elements of the body shape and many construction details were used in the Jaguar E-Type from 1961 to 1969.

==Competition history==

Jaguar D-Types fielded by a team under the leadership of Jaguar&#x27;s racing manager Lofty England were expected to perform well in their debut at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans race. In the event, the cars were hampered by fuel starvation caused by problems with the fuel filters, necessitating pit stops for their removal, after which the entry driven by Duncan Hamilton and Tony Rolt speeded up to finish less than a lap behind the winning Ferrari. The D-Type&#x27;s aerodynamic superiority is evident from its maximum speed of on the Mulsanne Straight compared with the 4.9 litre Ferrari&#x27;s . Three weeks later the D Type won the Rheims 12 hour endurance race.

For 1955 the cars were modified with long-nose bodywork and engines uprated with larger valves. At Le Mans, they proved competitive with the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLRs, which had been expected to win. Mike Hawthorn&#x27;s D-Type had a narrow lead over Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s Mercedes when another Mercedes team car was involved in the most catastrophic accident in motorsport history. Driver Pierre Levegh and more than 80 spectators lost their lives, while many more were injured.

Mercedes withdrew from the race. Jaguar opted to continue, and the D-Type driven by Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb went on to win.

Mercedes withdrew from motorsport at the end of the 1955 season, and Jaguar again entered Le Mans in 1956. Although only one of the three factory-entered cars finished, in sixth place, the race was won by a D-Type entered by the small Edinburgh-based team Ecurie Ecosse and driven by Ron Flockhart and Ninian Sanderson, beating works teams from Aston Martin and Scuderia Ferrari.

In America, the Cunningham team raced several D-Types. In 1955, for example, a 1954 works car on loan to Cunningham won the Sebring 12 Hours in the hands of Mike Hawthorn and Phil Walters, and in May 1956 the team&#x27;s entries for Maryland&#x27;s Cumberland national championship sports car race included four D-Types in Cunningham&#x27;s white and blue racing colors. Driven by John Fitch, John Gordon Benett, Sherwood Johnston and team owner Briggs Cunningham, they finished fourth, fifth, seventh and eighth, respectively.
Although Jaguar withdrew from motorsport at the end of the 1956 season, 1957 proved to be the D-Type&#x27;s most successful year. 3.8-litre engine Jaguar D-Types took five of the top six places at Le Mans, and Ecurie Ecosse, with considerable support from Jaguar, finished first and second, the best result in the D-Type&#x27;s racing history.

Rules for the 1958 Le Mans race limited engine sizes to three litres for sports racing cars, which ended the domination of the 3.8-litre D-Type. Jaguar developed a 3.0 litre version to power D-Types in the 1958, 1959 and 1960 Le Mans races, but it proved unreliable, and by 1960 no longer produced sufficient power to be competitive.

The D-Type never again achieved a podium finish at Le Mans. Its success waned as support from Jaguar decreased and cars from rival manufacturers became more competitive, although from 1960 the D Type continued for a further three years or more to be one of the cars to beat in club racing and national events.

==XKSS==

After Jaguar temporarily retired from racing as a factory team in 1956, the company offered the remaining unfinished D-Types as XKSS versions whose additional road-going equipmentincluding a passenger seat, passenger-side door, side windows, full-width framed windscreen and windscreen wipers, trimmed interior, folding hood, and bumpersmade them eligible for production sports car races in America.

On the evening of 12 February 1957, a fire broke out at Jaguar&#x27;s Browns Lane plant and destroyed nine of the 25 cars that were in various stages of completion. With the requisite jigs and tooling also destroyed, this effectively ended production of the XKSS version, although Jaguar later converted two additional D-Types that had not been part of the intended XKSS production run.

In March 2016, Jaguar announced that it would be completing the original 25 XKSS order by hand-building the remaining nine XKSS roadsters to the exact original specification, and assigning them the chassis numbers of the destroyed cars. The &quot;continuation&quot; reproductions were expected to sell for more than £1 million each.

==Jaguar D-Type continuation==
Jaguar announced the planned production of 25 D-Type &quot;continuation&quot; vehicles to be hand-built at the Warwickshire, UK workshop to complete Jaguar&#x27;s original goal of producing 100 D-Type based cars (the last twenty-five of which were to be turned into road-legal XKSS versions). Available options include 1955 short-nose or 1956 long-nose bodywork.

Given that Jaguar originally intended to build 100 D-Types, and allocated 100 chassis numbers for them, the combination of the 75 Jaguar claims it already built in the 1950s, plus the 25 XKSS conversions (built in two installments, 16 in 1957 and 9 more starting in 2016), accounts for all 100 original chassis numbers. It is unknown what numbers were to be assigned to the 25 additional &quot;continuation&quot; Type-D&#x27;s.

The vehicle was unveiled in Salon Rétromobile 2018 in Paris.

==Value==
A 1955 model was sold at a RM Sotheby&#x27;s auction in Monterey in 2016 for $21,780,000 (£16,641,143). This is the most expensive Jaguar ever to sell at auction.

<text>Luis Ernesto Pérez Gómez (born 12 January 1981) is a Mexican former professional footballer and current manager.

==Club career==

Pérez debuted in the Primera División with Necaxa in the 1999 Invierno season, playing his first game 21 September in a 3–1 victory against Santos Laguna. Pérez finished the season having played in 11 games, and by the beginning of the next year had a firm grip of the starting position. Pérez was named rookie of the tournament at the end of the season. Pérez played the next four years with Necaxa, until, to the surprise of many, was sold to Monterrey for the Clausura 2003, where he led Monterrey to win the championship by defeating Morelia at Estadio Morelos in Morelia. In the championship season, Pérez appeared in 23 matches, scored two goals and registered an assist. As with Necaxa, Pérez has been in the Monterrey lineup since his arrival.

In 2009, he wore the captain armband as he and his team won the Apertura 2009 tournament by beating Cruz Azul at Estadio Azul in Mexico City. In the championship season, Pérez appeared in 18 matches, scored three goals and registered two assists. He also won the 2010 InterLiga with Monterrey, beating América in penalty kicks, that qualified Monterrey into the 2010 Copa Libertadores. On June he became property of Guadalajara, by an agreement between the manager of Monterrey and the sporting director of Chivas, Michel Leaño. On 7 July he scored his first goal with Guadalajara.

On 13 December 2016, Pérez announced his retirement from professional soccer.

==International career==
Perez made his debut with the senior national team on 17 November 1998 in a friendly against El Salvador in Los Angeles. Uncapped through the next two years, he reemerged in 2000. His first official tournament was the 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup, where Mexico did not win any matches. Pérez made appearances for the team in the Gold Cup in 2003, and playing for the U-23 team in the 2004 Summer Olympics. Pérez appeared in the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup where he played in all five matches, including assisting Jared Borgetti in a losing effort against Germany in the third place match. Pérez was included by then coach Ricardo Lavolpe in the 2006 FIFA World Cup squad. He came on in the 45th minute for Gerardo Torrado in the first match against Iran. Pérez did not appear in the second match against Angola, which Mexico and Angola drew 0–0, however he started the third match against Portugal, but he was sent-off in the 61st minute. Mexico lost the match 2–1. He was banned for the round of 16 match against Argentina because of his red card against Portugal.
He was called up for the friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 February 2011, and was subbed on for Javier &quot;Chicharito&quot; Hernández in the 80th minute. He played the rest of the match which Mexico won 2–0. He was called up for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup but had to withdraw due to an injury.

==Managerial career==
After retiring from playing, Pérez became assistant coach of CD Toledo in Spain&#x27;s Tercera División.

In August 2020, Pérez became head coach of the under-17 national team, following the departure of Marco Antonio Ruiz.

<doc id="1257504" wikidata="Q659600" url="?curid=1257504" title="Launch (boat)">
<text>Launch is a name given to several different types of boat. The wide range of usage of the name extends from utilitarian craft through to pleasure boats built to a very high standard.

In naval use, the launch was introduced as a ship&#x27;s boat towards the end of the 17th century. On each warship, the launch was usually the largest boat out of those carried aboard. It could be propelled by oar or sail, with this type remaining in service into the 20th century. Steam launches were introduced on a trial basis in 1867, but as steam-powered ship&#x27;s boats became more common, the majority were steam pinnaces. 

Other military examples were the various motor launches used in the 20th century, employed for harbour defence, anti-submarine patrols, escorting coastal convoys, minesweeping and recovering aircrew from crashed aircraft. Generally these were decked boats, some of which were capable of fast speeds.

A powered boat operated by a regulatory or official organisation may be termed a launchsuch as the police launch or a harbour-master&#x27;s launch. The size range and capabilities vary according to the precise role.

In private use, a launch is invariably a powered boat, using a steam, electric, petrol or diesel engine. Some are built to a very high standard of finish, with large amounts of varnished hardwood and polished fittings. Various local historic types are kept in use by enthusiasts and museums.
==Etymology==
The word launch is derived from the Spanish &quot;lancha&quot;, which may be translated into English as &quot;pinnace&quot;. It has been suggested that &quot;lancha&quot; is in turn derived from a Malay word Lancaran. The first instance of &quot;launch&quot; being used as a boat type in English was in 1697.

==History==

The launch steadily replaced the long-boat in the Royal Navy over the latter half of the 18th century. Both were usually the biggest boat carried by a warship or a merchant vessel in the age of sail. The transition from longboat to launch was influenced by the East India Company successfully experimenting with this change.
Launches were preferred as having greater carrying capacity, though they could be considered less seaworthy. One of two important roles was the carrying of drinking water. For example, a launch of 1804 could carry 14 large &quot;leaguers&quot; (barrels containing each), making a load of just over nine and half tonnes of water. A warship&#x27;s launch would also be fitted with a windlass that allowed a ship&#x27;s anchor to be carried or to be weighed (raised). This second essential role, generally for a ship&#x27;s boat and specifically for the launch, was the laying out of anchors or weighing them after use. Before steam tugs were available, a ship&#x27;s boat would often be used to kedge a ship out of a harbour or away from a hazard such as a lee shore, set a new anchor or inspect the cable if moored for a long time, among a range of &quot;anchor work&quot; tasks.

The launches issued to naval ships varied in size depending on the size of the ship they equipped. An 1815 schedule of ship&#x27;s boats showed the range of 15 different lengths for launches from for a ship of 100 guns down to for a 200 ton sloop. As steam power became common in the navy, the need to transport drinking water (which could be distilled in the engine room) and transport anchors and cables to move a sailing ship both disappeared. By the last quarter of the 19th century, launches were only issued in one length, .

Launches had double-banked oars The usual sailing rig for much of the 19th century was a two-masted ketch rig. A schooner rig was in use from 1878 and the de Horsey sloop rig was adopted from 1884.

During the Demak Sultanate attack on Portuguese Malacca of 1513, lancaran were used as armed troop transports for landing alongside penjajap and kelulus, as the Javanese junks were too large to approach shore.

In 1788 Captain William Bligh and 18 crewmen were set adrift by mutineers in HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;’s 23-foot (7 m) launch. Bligh navigated the open boat more than 4,000 miles, losing only one manTonga to Timor, .

==Civilian use in the UK==
On the River Thames the term &quot;launch&quot; is used to mean any motorised pleasure boat. The usage arises from the legislation governing the management of the Thames and laying down the categories of boats and the tolls for which they were liable.

==Military use in the UK==

&quot;Motor Launch&quot; was the designation for a type of vessel used in World War I and World War II by the Royal Navy and some other navies for inshore work defending harbours (Harbour defence motor launch) and defending the coast from submarines. The World War II boats were typically long and carried relatively light armament – a few depth charges, one or two small guns and a few machine guns.

The Royal Air Force used various boats to support flying boats and to rescue the crews of aircraft that had crashed at sea. The RAF High Speed Launches, such as the Type Two 63 ft HSL, of World War II were derivatives of motor torpedo boat designs.

== Sports ==
In competitive rowing the term &quot;launch&quot; is used to refer to any motorized boat used by the coach to follow practicing boats during workouts.

<doc id="1257534" wikidata="Q295883" url="?curid=1257534" title="Claudio López (footballer)">
<text>Claudio Javier López (, born 17 July 1974) is an Argentine former professional footballer, who played as a forward. Nicknamed &quot;Piojo&quot; (louse), he is best known for his spells with Valencia in Spain and Lazio in Italy. López also had a notable impact in the Argentina national team, participating in two World Cups.

==Club career==

===Early career===
López began his professional career with Estudiantes de La Plata in his native Argentina in 1990 as a 16-year-old. However, he moved to Racing the next year, where he would remain until he transferred in 1996 to Spanish club Valencia.

===Europe===
After a slow start in 1996–97, Claudio López would enjoy a prolific spell with Valencia over the 3 years that followed, averaging 20 goals each season between 1997–98 and 1999–2000. That included a season best in 1998–99 which saw him find the net on 30 occasions across competitions to become the club&#x27;s top scorer (3rd best in la Liga behind Raul and Rivaldo, despite taking fewer penalties than his rivals).

Valencia entrenched their status as one of Spain&#x27;s emerging clubs throughout the late 1990s, rising from their usual mid-table position to 4th in 1998–99 and 3rd in 1999–2000, which was Lopez&#x27;s last season with the club. The Argentine formed a devastating partnership with Romanian Adrian Ilie and played alongside such stars as Jocelyn Angloma, Santiago Cañizares and Gaizka Mendieta, who would later be his teammate at Lazio as well.

López remained with Valencia for four years, helping the team to the final of the UEFA Champions League in the 1999–2000 season, when he was transferred to Lazio of Serie A for €35 million. During the first half of his spell in Italy&#x27;s capital, he was partnered with compatriot Hernán Crespo in the front-line. However, López suffered from injury problems during his time at Lazio. During the 2000–2001 UEFA Champions League, he scored a direct goal from a corner kick against Anderlecht in the Stadio Olimpico.

After Crespo left for Inter Milan in the summer of 2002, López was partnered with newcomer Bernardo Corradi. They formed a solid partnership that yielded a combined 25 Serie A goals as Lazio finished 4th to qualify for the Champions League under new coach Roberto Mancini. The Argentine scored 15 of those goals, his best league tally during his years in Italy; the 4th-place finish for Lazio was also the best the club would achieve until 2011–12.

In December 2002 he made headlines during a Serie A clash with Inter that ended 3-3: after netting a hat-trick that gave his side a 3–0 lead, Claudio López improvised an &quot;Aserejé&quot; goal celebration with teammate Bernardo Corradi, inspired by the dance routine of Spanish band Las Ketchup. In an interview 13 years later, he explained that the unexpected celebration had happened because &quot;crazy Corradi enjoyed doing such things!&quot;

In the UEFA Cup, López found the net twice to help his team reach the semi-finals, where they would be knocked out by the eventual winners, Jose Mourinho&#x27;s FC Porto. The following season was less successful for Lazio as they only finished 6th in Serie A and crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage. Claudio López only found the net 4 times in 36 appearances. He did manage, however, to win his second piece of silverware with the Roman club as they overcame Juventus in the two-legged Coppa Italia Final.

===Mexico, return to Racing===
López joined Club América for the 2004 Apertura, where he played in 17 games, scoring four goals. The following season, Clausura 2005 brought better results, with López scoring a total of 14 goals overall and helping the team to its tenth League championship in its history. It was his first and only league championship with any team. Claudio was instrumental to the team&#x27;s success, also helping them win the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup by scoring two goals in the Final over Tecos UAG. He played the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup.

In 2007 López returned to Racing, 11 years after his departure from the club, and the country. In most of those games, usually coming in as a late sub, López scored several important goals.

===Major League Soccer===
On 7 March 2008, it was announced López had signed with the Kansas City Wizards on a free transfer. López fell under the league&#x27;s designated player qualification, which means only the first $415,000 of his salary counted against Kansas City Wizards’ team salary cap. He later had his contract restructured to take him below designated player status.
 He scored on his debut for Kansas City against D.C. United on 29 March 2008.

On 23 February 2010, the Argentine striker left after two seasons Kansas City Wizards. &quot;We would have liked to have Claudio back in 2010, but unfortunately it became clear early in the contract negotiations that we could not give him what he desired,&quot; Wizards Manager Peter Vermes said.

López was later signed by league rivals Colorado Rapids on 2 April 2010.

After the 2010 MLS season Colorado declined López&#x27;s contract option and Lopez elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. López became a free agent in Major League Soccer when he was not selected in the Re-Entry draft.

==International career==
López had a distinguished career with Argentina. After winning a silver medal with the Under-23 team during the 1996 Summer Olympics, López made appearances in both the 1998 and 2002 World Cups. He scored a goal against the Netherlands in the 1998 FIFA World Cup quarter-final, when he kicked the ball between Edwin van der Sar&#x27;s legs to tie the match temporarily, although Argentina were ultimately defeated 2–1.

==Style of play==
According to media López was capable of playing anywhere along the front-line, as a striker, in a supporting role, and on the wing. He was highly regarded for his pace, technique, and dribbling skills, as well as his powerful striking ability with his left foot. He was also an effective set-piece and penalty taker. Throughout his career, he was known by the nickname &quot;El Piojo&quot;, meaning &quot;the louse&quot;.

==Media==
López was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials. In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, he starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scopion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo, Edgar Davids, Fabio Cannavaro, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;.

<doc id="1257538" wikidata="Q1057147" url="?curid=1257538" title="Outlawz">
<text>Outlawz was an American hip-hop group founded by Tupac Shakur and Yafeu Fula in 1995. Originally known as Thoro Headz and Young Thugs, the group attracted attention with their appearance on Tupac&#x27;s song &quot;Flex&quot;, which was the B-side of his single &quot;Holler If Ya Hear Me&quot;, released on February 4, 1993. 

In late 1993, Mutah &quot;Napoleon&quot; Beale joined the group, which then adopted the name Dramacydal. The group later appeared on the tracks &quot;Me Against the World&quot; and &quot;Outlaw&quot; from Shakur&#x27;s album &quot;Me Against the World&quot;, released on March 14, 1995.

==History==
===1992–1995: Early days, Dramacydal===
In 1992, Kastro, E.D.I Mean, and Tupac&#x27;s godbrother Yafeu &quot;Kadafi&quot; Fula, formed a rap trio. They began rapping under the names Thoro Headz and Young Thugs. By then, Tupac had become a rap star and they were featured on his song Flex which was the B side of his &quot;Holla If Ya Hear Me&quot; single which was released on February 4, 1993. In late 1993, Mutah &quot;Napoleon&quot; Beale joined the group, which was now known as Dramacydal. They guest appeared on the songs &quot;Me Against the World&quot; and &quot;Outlaw&quot; from Tupac&#x27;s LP, &quot;Me Against the World&quot;, which was released on March 14, 1995.

===1995–present: Outlawz===
The group was reintroduced as the Outlaw Immortalz in February 1996. The members included Shakur, who used the alias &quot;Makaveli,&quot; Hussein Fatal and Yaki Kadafi, known as Fatal-N-Felony. Thug Life members Big Syke and Mopreme Shakur were also included, going by the aliases &quot;Mussolini&quot; and &quot;Komani,&quot; respectively. Dramacydal Big Malc, K-Dog, and Lil&#x27; Mu used the aliases E.D.I. Mean, Kastro, and Napoleon. They were first featured on the song &quot;When We Ride&quot; from Shakur&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;. Storm, introduced on &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; as the only female member, became the ninth member of the group and began working on her solo album under Tupac&#x27;s management.

In June 1996, Hussein, Kadafi, and E.D.I. were featured on Shakur&#x27;s &quot;Death Row Greatest Hits&quot; diss track &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up,&quot; now credited as &quot;The Outlawz.&quot; Although Kastro and Napoleon were not featured on the track, they appeared in the music video.

During the recording of &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; and &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up,&quot; Hussein and Kadafi introduced their homeboy Rufus Cooper III to 2Pac. Cooper, who later became known as Young Noble, joined the group and was featured on Makaveli&#x27;s album &quot;The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory&quot;.

The group signed with Death Row Records in 1997 after the death of 2Pac and remained on the label until 1999. They released a collaboration album with 2Pac titled &quot;Still I Rise&quot; which went on to get certified platinum and peak at #6 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. After the release of the album, they went on to form their own record label, &quot;Outlaw Recordz&quot;, and released &quot;Ride wit Us or Collide wit Us&quot; in 2000.

==Former members==

*Tupac Amaru Shakur, alias: Makaveli, the original leader of the group, named after the Italian political philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli, was murdered in September 1996 at age 25. In 2011, members of the group confirmed the longstanding rumour that they smoked Shakur&#x27;s ashes in a blunt mixed with kush on a beach after his cremation.
*Yafeu Akiyele Fula, alias: Yaki Kadafi, Shakur&#x27;s godbrother and named after Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, was shot dead by Roddy Beale (cousin of fellow group member Napoleon) in November 1996 at age 19.
*Bruce Edward Washington Jr., alias: Hussein Fatal, childhood friend of Kadafi and named after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, briefly left the group on bad terms due to the group not protecting Shakur at the time of the Vegas shooting; for forgiving Roddy Beale for Kadafi&#x27;s death; and for signing to Death Row Records after Shakur asked them not to. In 2010, Fatal rejoined the group to record the album &quot;Perfect Timing&quot; which saw its release in 2011. In 2015, Fatal died in a car accident at age 42. The following year he was posthumously credited as a featured artist on the Outlawz song &quot;So Much Pain&quot;.
*Katari Terrance Cox, alias: Kastro, Shakur&#x27;s cousin and named after Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, left the group in 2009, citing differences in the group&#x27;s direction post-Shakur&#x27;s passing and to also pursue a solo career.
*Mutah Wassin Shabazz Beale, alias: Napoleon, childhood friend of Kadafi and named after French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, left the music industry and became a motivational speaker after converting to Islam in 2001.
*Tyruss Gerald &quot;Big Syke&quot; Himes, alias: Mussolini, member of Shakur&#x27;s previous group Thug Life and named after Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, died of natural causes in 2016 at age 48. Big Syke is only credited as a member of the Outlawz on one song; the group&#x27;s introductory track, &quot;When We Ride&quot;, from Shakur&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;. Syke later guest featured on the song &quot;Letter to the President&quot; from the group&#x27;s first album &quot;Still I Rise&quot; which saw its release in 1999. Although he&#x27;s featured with the Outlawz on the song &quot;M.O.B.&quot; from Shakur&#x27;s posthumous album Until the End of Time, he is instead credited with Mopreme as a member of Thug Life. He was also credited as a solo artist alongside the Outlawz on the song &quot;There U Go&quot; from Shakur&#x27;s following release, &quot;Better Dayz&quot;.
* Mopreme Shakur, alias: Komani, Tupac Shakur&#x27;s stepbrother and member of the group Thug Life, was named after Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini. Mopreme only made one credited appearance as an Outlaw; their introductory track, &quot;When We Ride&quot;, from the 2Pac album &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;. Although he does feature on the song &quot;M.O.B.&quot; from his late brother&#x27;s posthumous album Until the End of Time, he is instead credited as a member of Thug Life alongside Big Syke.
* Donna Harkness, alias: Storm, the only female of the group, met Tupac and immediately became an official Outlaw Immortal in 1995 by 2Pac himself. She was featured on three tracks on the 1996 All Eyez On Me Album &quot;Tradin War Stories&quot; &quot;Thug Passion&quot; and &quot;Run Tha Streetz.&quot; She later featured on the Gridlock’d and Gang-Related Soundtracks and some of Tupac’s posthumous albums and unreleased tracks. Storm left the group after the passing of Tupac and was subsequently taken off of some of 2Pac&#x27;s original unreleased tracks that were later remixed. She and Young Noble are the only members not named after a historical figure or dictator.

<text>Screwtape appears as a fictional demon in &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; (first published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; 1941, collected and published in book form 1942) and in its sequel short story &quot;Screwtape Proposes a Toast&quot; (1959), both written by the Christian author C. S. Lewis. Screwtape is also the title of the stage adaptation of the &quot;Letters&quot; by James Forsyth (originally &quot;Dear Wormwood&quot;, 1961). 

Screwtape holds the rank of Senior Tempter and serves as the Undersecretary of his department in what Lewis envisages as a sort of infernal Civil Service. &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; represent his side of the correspondence with his nephew Wormwood, as mentor to the young demon who is charged with the guidance of one man. He has a secretary called Toadpipe. The &quot;Toast&quot; is Screwtape&#x27;s after-dinner speech at the Tempters&#x27; Training College and satirises American and British or English public education. 

Screwtape appears to understand very well the nature of human minds and human weaknesses, although nothing about human love. He also has a way with words and a fondness for sarcasm.

<text>The Wind River Experimental Forest is an ecological and silvicultural research in Stabler, Washington, in the United States. Used as a research site by the U.S. Forest Service beginning in 1908, and functioning as an experimental forest since 1932, it is &quot;known as the cradle of forest research in the Pacific Northwest&quot;. The site is probably best known for the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility (WRCCRF), a -high freestanding tower crane which supported an 8-person gondola allowing scientists to view the forest canopy from above. The tallest trees in the forest are about .

Many studies at Wind River continue for decades. This long-term research has resulted in important findings about forest ecology and management.

==Location==
It is located west of the Cascade Range in the south-central area of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, north of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. It is about a 1.5-hour drive east of Vancouver, Washington, in the Mount Adams Ranger District.

==History==

Research at Wind River began with the assignment of Forest Service scientist Thornton T. Munger in 1908 to the new North Pacific District in Portland, Oregon. Munger began studying the Douglas fir trees of the western Cascades, setting up research plots throughout the Wind River area. In 1910, Munger, along with Julius Kummel, established a permanent nursery at Wind River, near the existing Hemlock Ranger Station on the Columbia National Forest (today the Gifford Pinchot National Forest). In 1912, Munger established the Wind River Arboretum to study the sustainability of exotic trees in the Pacific Northwest environment.

The successful research operations already in place at Wind River led to the Forest Service officially designating the site as the Wind River Experiment Station in 1913. The Wind River Experiment Station became the Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station in 1924, with operations based in Portland, Oregon and Thornton Munger as director. In 1932, the research area was officially designated as the Wind River Experimental Forest.

==The WRCCRF==

The WRCCRF was established in 1994 and erected in 1995 as a cooperative scientific and educational venture among the University of Washington (UW) College of Forest Resources, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Pacific Northwest Research Station, and the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The crane is a Liebherr 550 HC freestanding tower crane with a load jib extension purchased from Morrow Crane Company, Inc., of Salem, Oregon.

According to an article by Sandra Hines, &quot;While scientists have studied the tropical rain forest canopy for years with cranes, this is the first extensive study of the temperate forest canopy.&quot; UW professor Jerry Franklin (who Hines describes as &quot;the guiding force behind the crane&quot;) said that the study demonstrates that temperate conifer forests are better at banking carbon than any other ecosystem in the world, certainly more than tropical forests on a per unit area basis, at least 178 tons per acre (40 kg/m2.) This finding could have significant impact on strategies to fight global warming.

The WRCCRF ceased operation in 2011. It was retrofitted with ecological monitoring sensors as part of the National Ecological Observatory Network.

==Administration==
It is administered cooperatively by the USFS Pacific Northwest Research Station and Gifford Pinchot National Forest, and is one of ten experimental areas associated with the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Pacific Northwest Research Station.

The experimental forest has two administrative units: the Trout Creek and Panther Creek divisions. The Trout Creek division has old-growth forests, stands that originated after large wildfires in the first third of the 20th century, and young stands regenerated after clearcuts in the last half of the 20th century. The Panther Creek division has mature stands that grew after a fire in the early 1840s and young stands from more recent clearcuts.

<text>WrestleMania X was the tenth annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on March 20, 1994, at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York. The central focus of the pay-per-view was the WWF Championship, which was defended in two matches. Due to Lex Luger and Bret Hart being named the co-winners of the 1994 Royal Rumble match, both challenged champion Yokozuna. Luger was first but was disqualified for pushing the referee. Hart faced Yokozuna later in the evening and won the championship by pinning Yokozuna. This led to a lengthy worked feud between Bret and his brother Owen, who had defeated Bret in the opening match of the pay-per-view.

Several other major feuds were also highlighted. Razor Ramon defeated Shawn Michaels in a Ladder match to resolve an angle in which the two had argued over the rightful holder of the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Bam Bam Bigelow gained revenge against Doink the Clown, with whom he had been feuding, by teaming with Luna Vachon to defeat Doink and his partner Dink. Randy Savage settled his feud with Crush by defeating him in a Falls Count Anywhere match.

WrestleMania X was the first edition of the event not to include Hulk Hogan, who had been seen as the public face of the WWF. The card also marked Randy Savage&#x27;s last televised match for the company.

==Production==
===Background===

WrestleMania is considered the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF, now WWE) flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of the WWF&#x27;s original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot;, and one of the &quot;Big Five&quot;, along with King of the Ring that was established in 1993. WrestleMania X was scheduled to be held on March 20, 1994, at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York, the same venue of the first WrestleMania.

===Storylines===
The storyline surrounding the WWF Championship began at the 1994 Royal Rumble when the final two wrestlers, Lex Luger and Bret Hart, simultaneously eliminated each other. After a disagreement between two referees, Jack Tunney, the WWF President, declared Luger and Hart co-winners. Tunney announced that both wrestlers would get a WWF Championship match at WrestleMania, the prize given to the winner of the Royal Rumble match, and both wrestlers would have to wrestle two matches for the pay-per-view.

Tunney announced that a coin toss would be used to decide who faced Yokozuna for the belt first. If Luger won, he would face Yokozuna first. Hart would then wrestle his brother Owen Hart before facing the winner of the Luger-Yokozuna match. If Hart won the coin toss, he would get the first title shot, and Luger would wrestle Crush earlier on the card. On the January 31, 1994 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Luger won the coin toss and the right to face Yokozuna first.
Bret Hart was booked to face his brother Owen, with whom he was in the middle of a feud. The storyline between the Hart brothers began at Survivor Series 1993, where they were competing on the same side of an elimination match. As Owen was fighting in the ring, Bret, who had sustained a kayfabe injury, was staggering along the ring apron. Owen ran into Bret, causing Owen to lose his focus and get eliminated from the match. After the match, Owen returned to the ring and had a confrontation with Bret. In the following weeks, Owen demanded a match with Bret, but Bret refused to accept the challenge. Eventually, the storyline had the brothers reunite to face The Quebecers at Royal Rumble 1994. During the match, Bret sustained another kayfabe injury, causing the referee to end the match. In a planned turn, Owen got upset by the loss and attacked Bret to restart the feud.
Luger&#x27;s feud with Yokozuna began on July 4, 1993, at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge. In June, Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna&#x27;s manager, challenged all American athletes to attempt to bodyslam Yokozuna on the deck of the . After several athletes failed, the storyline saw Luger arrive by helicopter and successfully bodyslam Yokozuna. This began a strong push for Luger, who was then scheduled to challenge Yokozuna for the WWF Championship at SummerSlam 1993. Luger won the match by countout but did not win the title. The WWF claimed that the match stipulations did not allow Luger a rematch. The storyline saw Luger campaigning for entry into the 1994 Royal Rumble, as he wanted the title shot that would be given to the winner. Luger was eventually entered into the match, although The Great Kabuki and Genichiro Tenryu were also entered, on Mr. Fuji&#x27;s behalf, to attempt to prevent Luger from winning. Kabuki and Tenryu were unsuccessful, however, as Luger won the match and gained a match for the WWF Championship.

The storyline leading to the match between &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage and Crush focused on the supposedly strained friendship between the two wrestlers. On the July 12, 1993, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Crush challenged Yokozuna for the WWF Championship. At the end of the match, Yokozuna performed the Banzai Drop to win the match. After the match, he performed three more Banzai Drops while various wrestlers ran to the ring to stop the attack. Savage eventually came to the ring to help Crush. Following the match, Crush was not seen on televised matches for several months, although he continued to appear at house shows. On October 18, Crush appeared on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; accompanied by Yokozuna and Yokozuna&#x27;s manager, Mr. Fuji. Crush criticized Savage for not intervening sooner during the July 12 match. In a worked promo, Crush announced that he had turned against Savage and the United States in order to align himself with Yokozuna and Fuji. He then attacked Savage by dropping him on the ringside guard rail. Yokozuna performed the Banzai Drop on Savage before a group of referees came to the ring to break up the fight. During the November 8, 1993 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Savage left his position as commentator to attack Crush. The following week, Jack Tunney announced that Savage was suspended from commentating as a result of the previous week&#x27;s attack. The feud intensified at Survivor Series 1993 when Savage and Crush caused each other to be eliminated from their respective matches.

Bam Bam Bigelow and Doink the Clown was engaged in a feud that began in the fall of 1993. Doink annoyed Bigelow with a series of pranks, such as throwing water and confetti on him and tripping him with a broom. Bigelow retaliated against Doink and Doink&#x27;s midget sidekick Dink. A match was booked for Survivor Series 1993, but Bigelow was unable to get revenge because Doink did not compete. Instead, the WWF prolonged the feud by having Bigelow&#x27;s team face The Bushwhackers and Men on a Mission dressed as Doinks. The feud eventually culminated in a match scheduled for WrestleMania X. In the match, Bigelow and his storyline girlfriend Luna Vachon competed against Doink and Dink in a Mixed tag team match.

The feud between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels also dated back to the fall of 1993. Jack Tunney announced that he was stripping Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough. There have been reports that the real reason for vacating the title was because Michaels refused to drop the belt. Ramon won the title after competing in a battle royal and defeating Rick Martel, the other finalist in the match. In the angle, Michaels refused to acknowledge the title change, however, as he insisted that he was the true Intercontinental Champion. To gain revenge against Ramon for taking the belt, Michaels attacked Ramon and helped Irwin R. Schyster to steal Ramon&#x27;s gold chains.

==Event==

In a dark match before the pay-per-view aired, The Heavenly Bodies faced The Bushwhackers. Near the end of the match, The Bushwhackers gained control when they performed the Battering Ram on Jimmy Del Ray. Tom Prichard, Del Ray&#x27;s partner, attacked Bushwhacker Butch before he was able to pin Del Ray. This allowed Del Ray to recover and pin Butch to win the match. As the broadcast began, Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler were introduced as commentators for the event and Little Richard sang &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;.

The first televised match was between Bret and Owen Hart. The beginning of the match went back and forth with neither wrestler gaining a strong advantage. The tension between the two was demonstrated by Owen&#x27;s bragging and Bret&#x27;s refusal to let Owen leave the ring. Owen eventually gained momentum by using a camel clutch on Bret and performing suplexes and a Tombstone piledriver. When Owen stood outside the ring to recuperate, Bret jumped over the top rope to attack him. Bret landed awkwardly, however, and suffered a kayfabe injury to his knee. Owen used a figure four leglock to capitalize on Bret&#x27;s sore leg. Bret was able to recover, and he kicked Owen in the back of the head and used a Bulldog and sleeper hold to weaken Owen. Owen regained the advantage, however, and applied the Sharpshooter on Bret. Bret was able to escape and perform a Sharpshooter on Owen. Bret then attempted to end the match with a victory roll, but Owen blocked it and pinned Bret to win the match.

Sy Sperling, the president of hair restoration company Hair Club for Men, appeared in the ring before the next match. He announced that he was at WrestleMania to introduce one of his latest clients, ring announcer Howard Finkel. Finkel came to the ring wearing a toupée, showing off his new hair while the crowd applauded. The match then began, as Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon came to the ring to face Doink the Clown and Dink. Bigelow attacked Doink at the beginning of the match with a dropkick and a powerslam. When Dink entered the match, the rules stated that Bigelow had to tag Vachon into the match. Dink ran around the ring avoiding Vachon, but she eventually caught him. She kicked him and powerslammed him, but she then missed a moonsault attempt. Doink and Bigelow re-entered the match, and Doink performed a DDT on Bigelow. Bigelow reversed the momentum to win the match after a diving headbutt on Doink. Bigelow pinned Doink to win the match, and he and Vachon then attacked Dink.
The next match was a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he then had to make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush reversed the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage&#x27;s eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush&#x27;s eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush&#x27;s legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.

Alundra Blayze defended her WWF Women&#x27;s Championship against Leilani Kai in the next match. Blayze began the match by using a leg sweep and two sunset flips. Kai came back with a powerslam and a suplex. Blayze got the win, however, by pinning Kai after performing a German suplex.

In the next match, Men on a Mission challenged The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Although The Quebecers attacked Men on a Mission before the bell, Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers. The Quebecers used several double-team moves against their opponents, but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb. Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche, allowing The Quebecers to suplex him. The Quebecers performed an assisted senton on Mabel but did not get a pinfall. Men on a Mission regained the advantage, prompting The Quebecers&#x27; manager, Johnny Polo, to pull his wrestlers out of the ring. Men on a Mission won the match by countout, but they did not win the belts.
The first WWF Championship match came next, as Lex Luger challenged Yokozuna. Mr. Perfect was revealed to be the guest referee for the match, while Donnie Wahlberg was the guest ring announcer and Rhonda Shear was the guest timekeeper. After a verbal confrontation between Luger and Yokozuna, Luger gained the early advantage by knocking Yokozuna out of the ring. After getting back into the ring, Yokozuna removed the turnbuckle padding from a corner of the ring. Yokozuna used a nerve hold and a belly to belly suplex to wear down Luger. As he tried to throw Luger&#x27;s head into the exposed turnbuckle, however, Luger blocked him and hit Yokozuna&#x27;s head into the turnbuckle. Luger then performed clotheslines and a powerslam on Yokozuna before knocking Yokozuna kayfabe unconscious with a running forearm smash. Yokozuna&#x27;s managers, Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette jumped onto the ring apron to distract Luger, and Luger pulled them into the ring and attacked them. Luger covered Yokozuna, but Mr. Perfect was tending to the fallen managers and did not make the count. When Luger pushed him, Mr. Perfect disqualified Luger and left the ring, thereby turning heel.

Adam Bomb and his manager Harvey Wippleman entered the ring for the next match, and Wippleman criticized Finkel&#x27;s new hair and tore the pocket off Finkel&#x27;s suit. Earthquake came to the ring and attacked Bomb from behind. He powerslammed Bomb and performed the Earthquake splash to get the pinfall victory in thirty-five seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earthquake/Bomb&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts belonging to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, and the first wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels&#x27; bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel to return to the dressing rooms. Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon&#x27;s attempt to perform the Razor&#x27;s Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest, and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up in the corner of the ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon&#x27;s chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental Championship.

A ten-man tag team match was supposed to take place next, but it was canceled due to time constraints. The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team (Irwin R. Schyster, The Headshrinkers, Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett) could not agree on who would be the team&#x27;s captain for the match. Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky Plugg, Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns. Bob Holly (&quot;Sparky Plugg&quot;), stated in his 2013 autobiography &quot;The Hardcore Truth&quot; that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match, but Michaels and Ramon ignored him and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match.
The final match of the night and main event was the WWF Championship match between Yokozuna and Bret Hart. The guest referee for the match was &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper, while the guest ring announcer was Burt Reynolds and the guest timekeeper was Jennie Garth. Yokozuna attacked Hart before the bell, and Hart attempted a couple of comebacks in vain. Eventually, Yokozuna made a mistake and allowed Hart to knock him to the mat. Cornette tried to distract Piper, but Piper punched him and knocked him off the ring apron. Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Hart but then missed an Avalanche attempt. Bret maintained the advantage for a little while, but Yokozuna came back with a belly to belly suplex. When Yokozuna attempted the Banzai drop, however, he lost his balance and fell to the mat. Hart quickly pinned Yokozuna to win the title. This match also marked the first time in WWF (now WWE) history that two wrestlers faced each other in a WWF World Title match at two consecutive WrestleManias as well as Bret become first wrestler to win both Intercontinental Championship and World Championship at WrestleMania. 

Afterwards, Bret Hart celebrated in the ring with several of the face wrestlers including Lex Luger, &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper, Razor Ramon, Tatanka, The 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky Plugg and &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage. Others who joined in the celebration included Burt Reynolds, Rhonda Shear, Donnie Wahlberg, and WWF commentators Gorilla Monsoon and Vince McMahon. Owen Hart stood in the aisle, glaring at Bret, then quickly left; the brothers continued their feud for the remainder of 1994, with the WWF Championship often on the line.

==Reception==
The event was attended by 18,065 people, who paid a total of $960,000 in admission fees. The buy-rate for this pay-per-view was 1.68, down from the 2.0 buy-rate that the previous WrestleMania had achieved.

The event received positive reviews from various websites and wrestling publications. In 2010, Rob McNew of 411mania gave the event an overall score of 9.0 out of 10.0 and noted that WrestleMania X &quot;may lack a lot of historical significance due to being during a relative downtime for the business, but this show kicked all kinds of ass.&quot; He further noted that &quot;Bret-Owen and Razor-Shawn were both coin flip choices for not only match of the year, but match of the decade as well.&quot; He concluded the review citing how WrestleMania X was &quot;easily one of the top five Wrestlemania’s ever.&quot;

Much of the praise towards the event was aimed at the ladder match between Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon. McNew of 411mania cited the match as &quot;downright groundbreaking for the time&quot; and an &quot;amazing match that put the ladder match on the map.&quot; It received a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer and was voted Match of the Year (1994) by readers of his &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; publication. &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; readers also named that match PWI Match of the Year (1994). It was placed #3 on IGN&#x27;s Top 20 Matches in Wrestlemania History and described as &quot;one of the most ground-breaking matches in wrestling history&quot;.

The opening match between Owen Hart and Bret Hart has also garnered acclaim. McNew described it as the &quot;best opening match in professional wrestling history&quot;. It was also #4 on the list of IGN&#x27;s Top 20 Matches in Wrestlemania History; writer Jon Robinson described it as &quot;the best opening match in pay-per-view history.&quot; Multi-time world champion Chris Jericho stated: &quot;For me, the best match on [WrestleMania X] was always Bret vs. Owen, and it kicked off the show and it was hard to follow...the story was &quot;amazing&quot;, it was kind of Owen&#x27;s coronation – it was a great moment&quot;. Mike &quot;The General&quot; Lambertson, a former professional wrestler from Deep South Wrestling and contributor to voicesofwrestling.com called the match “The greatest sports entertainment event in Madison Square Garden’s history” on episode 138 of the &quot;Talk is Jericho&quot; podcast.

==Aftermath==
Men on a Mission continued to challenge The Quebecers for the tag team belts. Men on a Mission won the title on March 29, 1994. This is said to have been an unplanned title change, as Mabel accidentally fell on Pierre to get the pinfall. This title reign lasted only two days, however, as The Quebecers won the titles back in a rematch.

Lex Luger and Mr. Perfect were scheduled to face each other in a series of matches on the WrestleMania Revenge Tour. Mr. Perfect was replaced by Crush, however, and Mr. Perfect did not appear again in the WWF until Survivor Series 1995.
Adam Bomb and Earthquake had a rematch on the April 4, 1994 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, which Earthquake won. The feud did not progress any further, as Earthquake left the WWF for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in May 1994. Wippleman and Finkel wrestled a series of Tuxedo matches in 1994 that culminated in a match on the January 9, 1995 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. Finkel defeated Wippleman in a final Tuxedo match to end the feud.

A few weeks after the match between Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon, Diesel begin to challenge Ramon for the Intercontinental championship. Michaels helped Diesel defeat Ramon for the title on April 13, 1994. This win began a push for Diesel that saw him win the WWF&#x27;s Triple Crown Championship in one calendar year.

The ten-man tag team match took place on the April 4, 1994 edition of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. The heel team won, as Irwin R. Schyster pinned the 1–2–3 Kid to win the match.

Bret and Owen Hart continued their feud throughout 1994. At King of the Ring, their real-life brother-in-law and Bret&#x27;s former tag team partner Jim Neidhart became involved in the angle by helping Owen win the tournament. During the coronation ceremony, Owen announced that he wanted to be referred to as the &quot;King of Harts&quot;. At SummerSlam, Bret successfully defended his title against Owen in a Steel cage match but was attacked after the match by Owen and Neidhart, prompting another brother-in-law, Davey Boy Smith, to get involved on Bret&#x27;s side. At Survivor Series, the storyline saw Owen partially responsible for costing Bret the WWF Championship. Bret faced Bob Backlund in a match with the stipulation that the winner would be declared when a competitor&#x27;s cornerman threw a towel into the ring to signify a submission. After Owen caused Smith to knock himself unconscious, Owen pretended to feel sympathy for Bret. While Backlund had Bret in a crossface Chickenwing, the angle had Owen convince his mother Helen to throw in Bret&#x27;s towel, enabling Backlund to win the match and the title. After the match, Owen celebrated with Backlund and showed that he was faking the concern for his brother.

<doc id="1257569" wikidata="Q4885590" url="?curid=1257569" title="Ben Elbert Douglas Sr.">
<text>Benjamin Elbert Douglas Sr. (September 3, 1894 – July 27, 1981) was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina from 1935 to 1941. He administered the construction of an airport for Charlotte. Charlotte Douglas International Airport, as the airport is named today, was named after him in 1954. A Democrat, he was also the first mayor of Charlotte who was directly elected by voters pursuant to a change in the city charter.

==Biography==
Douglas was born in Iredell County, North Carolina on September 3, 1894. He served in the United States Army during World War I.

In 1946 Ben Douglas founded Douglas Furs, after Franklin D. Roosevelt asked a personal favor of Ben Sr. – to find a way to clean the fleece-lined fur-trimmed flight jackets for the soldiers flying in the then current war in Europe. He used his knowledge gained in the dry cleaning business (he owned one in Charlotte prior) and his ingenuity gained him a government contract and later a thriving business in the fur trade. Douglas also was the relentless lobbyist for the now well-traveled Independence Boulevard. Mary Louise Douglas (his widow) continued to work at Douglas Furs 3 days a week until her death on December 29, 2007. The store is lined with historical text, newspaper articles of his election, and pictures of Ben and his accomplishments.

Douglas directed the North Carolina Department of Conservation and Development from 1953 to 1955. In 1956, Douglas unsuccessfully ran for Congress.

<doc id="1257570" wikidata="Q183321" url="?curid=1257570" title="Bad for Good">
<text>Bad for Good is the only studio album by American songwriter Jim Steinman. Steinman wrote all of the songs and performed on most, although Rory Dodd contributed lead vocals on some tracks.

The songs were originally intended to be recorded by Meat Loaf as a follow-up to &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, titled &quot;Renegade Angel&quot;. However, Meat Loaf suffered vocal problems and was unable to sing. He would record several tracks from &quot;Bad for Good&quot; for his later albums.

Critical reaction to the album was mixed, with a majority of the criticism directed at Steinman&#x27;s vocals. However, the album was a major commercial success, breaking the UK Top 10.

== History ==
In the midst of the success of &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, management and the record company put pressure on Steinman to stop touring in order to write a follow-up, provisionally titled &quot;Renegade Angel&quot;. Steinman joined Meat Loaf and his band for a live performance in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1978 with the intention of going through the songs for the new album after the show. However, someone broke into their dressing rooms during the show and stole several possessions, including the new lyric book. Many of the stolen songs would later appear on &quot;Bad for Good&quot;: &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;, &quot;Left in the Dark&quot; and &quot;Out of the Frying Pan.&quot; Meat Loaf jokes that he does not think that Steinman ever got over that theft.

Meat Loaf lost his voice and was unable to record &quot;Renegade Angel&quot;. Steinman says &quot;I spent seven months trying to make a follow-up [to &quot;Bat&quot;] with him, and it was an infernal nightmare. He had lost his voice, he had lost his house, and he was pretty much losing his mind.&quot; Not being able to &quot;bear for people not to hear those songs,&quot; Steinman recorded the album, retitled &quot;Bad for Good&quot;, as a solo project, with Rory Dodd providing lead vocals on some songs. Many musicians and backing vocalists from &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; performed on &quot;Bad for Good&quot;, including Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg from Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band.

Richard Corben illustrated the cover, as he had done for &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;. Describing the cover, &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine says &quot;the flesh, the puppy-fat on the mid-calf, the breasts, the upturned American nose ... Corben&#x27;s evocation of teenage femininity is so right! The cover, though, is the product of an alternative universe, like everything else about this album. The nude gymnasium scene is out, along with the other title &#x27;Renegade Angel&#x27;.&quot;

Around this time, Steinman contributed all eight songs for Meat Loaf&#x27;s album &quot;Dead Ringer&quot;, which was also released in 1981.

== Compositions ==
The first two songs, &quot;Bad for Good&quot; and &quot;Lost Boys and Golden Girls&quot;, were two of many songs written by Steinman under the inspiration of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and lost boys who never grow up. This is reflected in lyrics in &quot;Bad for Good&quot; such as &quot;You know I&#x27;m gonna be like this forever: I&#x27;m never gonna be what I should.&quot; The composer says that &quot;Peter Pan&quot; has &quot;always been about my favorite story and I&#x27;ve always looked at it from the perspective that it&#x27;s a great rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll myth because it&#x27;s about – when you get right down to it – it&#x27;s about a gang of lost boys who never grow up, who are going to be young forever and that&#x27;s about as perfect an image for rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll as I can think of.&quot; &quot;Lost Boys and Golden Girls&quot; is the basis for the musical &quot;Neverland&quot;, which Steinman says is &quot;a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll science fiction version of Peter Pan that takes place in a city built on the ruins of Los Angeles after a series of chemical wars.&quot; &quot;Neverland&quot; never got past the workshop stage, although the stage musical &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, scheduled to open in London in 2009, is based on the same concept.

The next track, &quot;Love and Death and an American Guitar&quot;, is a spoken word fantasy monologue, performed by Steinman that he used to do in the Meat Loaf shows. It opens by quoting lyrics from &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot; (&quot;I remember everything. I remember every little thing as if it happened only yesterday. I was barely seventeen&quot;), but instead of being &quot;barely dressed&quot; the protagonist &quot;once killed a boy with a Fender guitar.&quot; Influenced by The Doors, Steinman wanted to write a piece where &quot;the rhythm wasn&#x27;t coming from the drums so much as the voice – the rhythm of the spoken voice and the heartbeat behind it.&quot;
The final two tracks were originally packaged with the LP on an additional vinyl disc. &quot;The Storm&quot; is an orchestral piece. &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through&quot; is, according to music website Sputnik Music, a celebration of &quot;music being the only thing left to believe in, it is a cry to the musical gods, thanking them for the gifts they have been given.&quot; Similarly, AllMusic describes the song as &quot;a heart-tugging testament to the inspirational power of rock and roll.&quot;

== Track listing ==


On the original vinyl release, &quot;The Storm&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through&quot; were the A-side and B-side, respectively, of a 33-rpm 7&quot; single, enclosed with the album. These tracks, according to Steinman&#x27;s concept, are supposed to be the prelude and epilogue, respectively, of the album. The position of these tracks varies on the various versions: Most CDs included both at the end of the album, while cassettes place &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams&quot; at track 5 and &quot;The Storm&quot; at the end. An Australian CD release from 1989 places &quot;The Storm&quot; at track 1 and &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through&quot; at the end.

== Reception ==
In addition to breaking the UK Top 10, the album reached number 63 in the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and peaked at number 14 in the Swedish Top 60 Albums. &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through&quot; was released as the first single, reaching 14 in the Mainstream Rock chart, and number 32 in the Pop Singles chart.

The critical reaction to the album was mixed. Many reviews commented that Steinman&#x27;s singing voice was inadequate for the songs. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who also gave a lukewarm review of the first &quot;Bat&quot;, said &quot;Steinman&#x27;s thin, reedy voice simply cannot carry the absurd precocity of the lyrics&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&quot; also said retrospectively that Steinman &quot;simply does not have the vocal range or lung power necessary to make this dramatic style of rock and roll work. For example...[in] &quot;Left in the Dark&quot;, he struggles to keep up with vocal demands of this orchestral ballad, resulting in a vocal that sounds strained and occasionally off-key&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, though, said that &quot;to the surprise of many, Steinman&#x27;s vocals sounded stronger than expected&quot;.

&quot;AllMusic&quot; also complained &quot;that some of the songs repeat the &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; formula instead of building upon it; the obvious culprit in this arena is &quot;Dance in My Pants&quot;, a duet that gratuitously recycles the battle of the sexes verbal sparring and the multi-part structure of Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot; to less-impressive effect&quot;. However, they did praise &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through&quot;. They concluded that the album &quot;is too inconsistent and eccentric to keep the attention of the casual listener, but remains an interesting listen for anyone who appreciates Jim Steinman&#x27;s one-of-a-kind style of epic-size rock and roll&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized the &quot;Wagnerian excess, feral &quot;rock&quot; playing and vile choristering,&quot; suggesting that &quot;Todd Rundgren should have his wrists slapped for choking the upper end of his guitar&#x27;s neck in a vainglorious approximation of epiphany&quot;. &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine offers a positive review, saying that it is the album &quot;you&#x27;ve waited nearly four years for&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Many of the tracks, or elements thereof, on &quot;Bad for Good&quot; have been recorded by other artists, including projects that Steinman has been involved in. He produced Barbra Streisand recording &quot;Left in the Dark&quot; for her album &quot;Emotion&quot;, with the single reaching No. 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart in 1984. Her version changes a few lines, with her version changing &quot;so take off your dress&quot; to &quot;I watch you undress&quot;, to fit the song being sung from a female point of view.

The intro to &quot;Stark Raving Love&quot; was used for &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot;, a 1984 hit for Bonnie Tyler. He used excerpts from &quot;The Storm&quot; for &quot;Opening of the Box&quot; on the Pandora&#x27;s Box album &quot;Original Sin&quot;, and in the &quot;Ouverture&quot; for the musical &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;.

The refrain from &quot;Bad for Good&quot; (&quot;God speed! Speed us away!&quot;) also appears in &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot;, which Steinman wrote for the film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; (1984).

Comedy duo Scharpling &amp; Wurster, in their sketch &quot;The Gas Station Dogs&quot; from their album &quot;New Hope for the Ape-Eared&quot;, featured a delusional singer-songwriter promoting a song called &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Dreams Will Come Through&quot;.

Meat Loaf has recorded most of &quot;Bad for Good&quot;:
* &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; appears on his 1984 album &quot;Bad Attitude&quot;;
* &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through&quot;, &quot;Out of the Frying Pan (and Into the Fire)&quot;, &quot;Love and Death and an American Guitar&quot; (renamed &quot;Wasted Youth&quot;, and still using Steinman&#x27;s original voice with a new backing track), and &quot;Lost Boys and Golden Girls&quot; appear on &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot;. These were the only covers of Meat Loaf&#x27;s from &quot;Bad for Good&quot; that were produced by Steinman;
* &quot;Left in the Dark&quot; appears on &quot;Welcome to the Neighborhood&quot; (1995) (Meat uses the last line of Steinman&#x27;s spoken word opening to the song, &quot;who made the very first move&quot; to end his version);
* &quot;Bad for Good&quot; on &quot;Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose&quot;, with guest performer Brian May on guitar. In a documentary promoting the 2006 album, Meat Loaf acknowledged that there is a &quot;core of fans that know that song&quot;, so he &quot;had that under the microscope more than any other on the album&quot;. An excerpt of &quot;The Storm&quot; is used as intro to &quot;Seize the Night&quot; on &quot;Bat III&quot;.

<doc id="1257575" wikidata="Q1400236" url="?curid=1257575" title="Suicidal for Life">
<text>Suicidal for Life is the eighth studio album by American crossover thrash band Suicidal Tendencies, which was released in 1994. It is their sixth full-length album with original material, and their last album to feature lead guitarist Rocky George and bassist Robert Trujillo as well as their only one to feature drummer Jimmy DeGrasso. &quot;Suicidal for Life&quot; was also Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; final studio album released on Epic Records and their last one before their temporary breakup in 1995–1996.

==Overview==
&quot;Suicidal for Life&quot; was considered controversial among fans and critics, partly due to the album containing four consecutive songs with the word &quot;fuck&quot; in the title. By 1994, Suicidal Tendencies had become increasingly weary of their newfound fame following the massive success of &quot;Lights...Camera...Revolution!&quot; and &quot;The Art of Rebellion&quot;; as a result, with &quot;Suicidal for Life&quot;, the band decided to tone down the accessible aspects of their sound in favor of a more aggressive style than its predecessor. Frontman Mike Muir recalled to &quot;Loudwire&quot; of this era, saying: &quot;We&#x27;re not for everybody, we never were supposed to be, we&#x27;re not supposed to be a big band. We got bigger than we should have been, but, fortunately not big as other bands are - we&#x27;d probably be very unhappy. But I think what we do has meant a lot to other people and to be able to have an opportunity to go out there and people discover you, and still discover you, and appreciate what you&#x27;re doing. You can tell that - I believe we&#x27;re doing it for the right reasons.&quot;

==Reception==
The critical reception of &quot;Suicidal for Life&quot; was lackluster. AllMusic writer Eduardo Rivadavia gave the album an average of 1.5 out five stars, writing, &quot;Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; long relationship with Epic Records came to an end with 1994&#x27;s &quot;Suicidal for Life&quot; and, as expected, the breakup was not a pretty one. The label&#x27;s inability to introduce any of the group&#x27;s groundbreaking albums to a significantly wider audience certainly didn&#x27;t sit well with ST main man Mike Muir, who decided to run through the motions while being as gratuitously offensive as possible on this contractually necessary release.&quot;

Even though the album failed to live up to the expectations of Suicidal Tendencies&#x27; previous releases, commercial and otherwise, &quot;Suicidal for Life&quot; peaked at number 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, making it their second highest-chart entry behind &quot;The Art of Rebellion&quot;, which peaked at number 52. Among the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;What You Need&#x27;s a Friend&quot; had garnered airplay through radio (most notably from KNAC in Los Angeles), while a music video was shot for &quot;Love vs. Loneliness&quot; but received only limited airplay on MTV.

Suicidal Tendencies have rarely played any songs from &quot;Suicidal for Life&quot; since their reunion in 1996, though &quot;Fucked Up Just Right!&quot; was played live again briefly in 2012. &quot;What Else Could I Do?&quot;, &quot;What You Need&#x27;s a Friend&quot;, &quot;Depression and Anguish&quot;, &quot;Evil&quot; and &quot;Love vs. Loneliness&quot; have never been performed live.

<text>Social bookmarking is an online service which allows users to add, annotate, edit, and share bookmarks of web documents. Many online bookmark management services have launched since 1996; Delicious, founded in 2003, popularized the terms &quot;social bookmarking&quot; and &quot;tagging&quot;. Tagging is a significant feature of social bookmarking systems, allowing users to organize their bookmarks and develop shared vocabularies known as folksonomies.

==Common features==
Unlike file sharing, social bookmarking does not save the &quot;resources&quot; themselves, merely bookmarks that &quot;reference&quot; them, i.e. a link to the bookmarked page. Descriptions may be added to these bookmarks in the form of metadata, so users may understand the content of the resource without first needing to download it for themselves. Such descriptions may be free text comments, votes in favor of or against its quality, or tags that collectively or collaboratively become a folksonomy. Folksonomy is also called &quot;social tagging&quot;, &quot;the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content&quot;.

In a social bookmarking system, users save links to web pages that they want to remember and/or share. These bookmarks are usually public, and can be saved privately, shared only with specified people or groups, shared only inside certain networks, or another combination of public and private domains. The allowed people can usually view these bookmarks chronologically, by category or tags, or via a search engine.

Most social bookmark services encourage users to organize their bookmarks with informal tags instead of the traditional browser-based system of folders, although some services feature categories/folders or a combination of folders and tags. They also enable viewing bookmarks associated with a chosen tag, and include information about the number of users who have bookmarked them. Some social bookmarking services also draw inferences from the relationship of tags to create clusters of tags or bookmarks.

Many social bookmarking services provide web feeds for their lists of bookmarks, including lists organized by tags. This allows subscribers to become aware of new bookmarks as they are saved, shared, and tagged by other users. It also helps to promote your sites by networking with other social book markers and collaborating with each other.

As these services have matured and grown more popular, they have added extra features such as ratings and comments on bookmarks, the ability to import and export bookmarks from browsers, emailing of bookmarks, web annotation, and groups or other social network features.

==History==

The concept of shared online bookmarks is believed to have originated around April 1996 with the launch of itList, the features of which included public and private bookmarks. Another system known as WebTagger, developed by a team at the Computational Sciences Division at NASA, was presented at the Sixth International WWW Conference held in Santa Clara on April 7–11, 1997. WebTagger included several advanced social bookmarking features including the ability to collaboratively share and organize bookmarks using a web-based interface, provide comments and organize them according to categories. Within the next three years, online bookmark services became competitive, with venture-backed companies such as Backflip, Blink, Clip2, ClickMarks, HotLinks, and others entering the market. They provided folders for organizing bookmarks, and some services automatically sorted bookmarks into folders (with varying degrees of accuracy). Blink included browser buttons for saving bookmarks; Backflip enabled users to email their bookmarks to others and displayed &quot;Backflip this page&quot; buttons on partner websites. Lacking viable revenue models, this early generation of social bookmarking companies failed as the dot-com bubble burst—Backflip closed citing &quot;economic woes at the start of the 21st century&quot;. In 2005, the founder of Blink said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it was that we were &#x27;too early&#x27; or that we got killed when the bubble burst. I believe it all came down to product design, and to some very slight differences in approach.&quot;

Founded in 2003, Delicious (then called del.icio.us) pioneered tagging and coined the term &quot;social bookmarking&quot;. Frassle, a blogging system released in November 2003, included social bookmarking elements. In 2004, as Delicious began to take off, similar services Furl, Simpy, Spurl.net, and unalog were released, along with CiteULike and Connotea (sometimes called &quot;social citation&quot; services) and the related recommendation system Stumbleupon. Also in 2004, the social photo sharing website Flickr was released, and inspired by Delicious it soon added a tagging feature. In 2006, &quot;Ma.gnolia&quot; (later renamed to Gnolia), &quot;Blue Dot&quot; (later renamed to Faves), Mister Wong, and Diigo entered the bookmarking field, and Connectbeam included a social bookmarking and tagging service aimed at businesses and enterprises. In 2007, IBM released its Lotus Connections product. In 2009, Pinboard launched as a bookmarking service with paid accounts. As of 2012, Furl, Simpy, Spurl.net, Gnolia, Faves, and Connectbeam are no longer active services.

Digg was founded in 2004 with a related system for sharing and ranking social news, followed by competitors Reddit in 2005 and Newsvine in 2006. As of January 20, 2016, Reddit is now the 32nd highest ranking in the world and Digg is no longer a social bookmarking platform and has dropped out of the top 1000.

==Folksonomy==
A simple form of shared vocabularies does emerge in social bookmarking systems (folksonomy). Collaborative tagging exhibits a form of complex systems (or self-organizing) dynamics. Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources have been shown to converge over time to stable power law distributions. Once such stable distributions form, the correlations between different tags can be examined to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtain a form of community or shared vocabularies. While such vocabularies suffer from some of the informality problems described below, they can be seen as emerging from the decentralized actions of many users, as a form of crowdsourcing.

From the point of view of search data, there are drawbacks to such tag-based systems: no standard set of keywords (i.e., a folksonomy instead of a controlled vocabulary), no standard for the structure of such tags (e.g., singular vs. plural, capitalization), mistagging due to spelling errors, tags that can have more than one meaning, unclear tags due to synonym/antonym confusion, unorthodox and personalized tag schemata from some users, and no mechanism for users to indicate hierarchical relationships between tags (e.g., a site might be labeled as both &quot;cheese&quot; and &quot;cheddar&quot;, with no mechanism that might indicate that &quot;cheddar&quot; is a refinement or sub-class of &quot;cheeses&quot;).

==Uses==

For individual users, social bookmarking can be useful as a way to access a consolidated set of bookmarks from various computers, organize large numbers of bookmarks, and share bookmarks with contacts. Institutions, including businesses, libraries, and universities have used social bookmarking as a way to increase information sharing among members. Social bookmarking has also been used to improve web search.

===Enterprise bookmarking===
Unlike social bookmarking, where individuals can bookmark their favorite web resources to share those with the public on the internet, enterprise bookmarking is for knowledge management and sharing it within a specific network of an organization. Enterprise bookmarking is used by the users of an organization to tag, manage and share bookmarks on the web as well as the knowledge base of the organization&#x27;s databases and file servers. 

===Libraries===

Libraries have found social bookmarking to be useful as an easy way to provide lists of informative links to patrons. The University of Pennsylvania (UP) was one of the first library adopters with its PennTags.

===Education===

Social bookmarking tools are an emerging educational technology that has been drawing more of educators&#x27; attention over the last several years. This technology offers knowledge sharing solutions and a social platform for interactions and discussions. These tools enable users to collaboratively underline, highlight, and annotate an electronic text, in addition to providing a mechanism to write additional comments on the margins of the electronic document. For example, Delicious could be used in a course to provide an inexpensive answer to the question of rising course materials costs. RISAL (Repository of Intean organization&#x27;s users to manage and share bookmarks on the web and supporting teaching and learning at the university level.

Social bookmarking tools have several purposes in an academic setting including: organizing and categorizing web pages for efficient retrieval; keeping tagged pages accessible from any networked computer; sharing needed or desired resources with other users; accessing tagged pages with RSS feeds, cell phones and PDAs for increased mobilan organization&#x27;s users to tag, manage and share bookmarks on the web and giving students another way to collaborate with each other and make collective discoveries.

One requirement unique to education is that resources often have one URL that describes the resource, with another for the actual learning content. XtLearn.net allows bookmarking of both in one step, the relevant URL being delivered to either tutors or learners, depending on the delivery context. It also demonstrates integration with traditional learning content repositories, such as Jorum, NLN, Intute and TES.

==Comparison with search engines==

In comparison to search engines, a social bookmarking system has several advantages over traditional automated resource location and classification software, such as search engine spiders. All tag-based classification of Internet resources (such as web sites) is done by human beings, who understand the content of the resource, as opposed to software, which algorithmically attempts to determine the meaning and quality of a resource. Also, people can find and bookmark web pages that have not yet been noticed or indexed by web spiders. Additionally, a social bookmarking system can rank a resource based on how many times it has been bookmarked by users, which may be a more useful metric for end-users than systems that rank resources based on the number of external links pointing to it. However, both types of ranking are vulnerable to fraud, (see Gaming the system), and both need technical countermeasures to try to deal with this.

==Abuse==
Social bookmarking is susceptible to corruption and collusion. Due to its popularity, some have begun to use it as a tool to use along with search engine optimization to make their website more visible. The more often a web page is submitted and tagged, the better chance it has of being found. Spammers have started bookmarking the same web page multiple times and/or tagging each page of their web site using a lot of popular tags, obligating developers to constantly adjust their security system to overcome abuses. Furthermore, since social bookmarking generates backlinks, social bookmark link generating services are used by some webmasters in an attempt to improve their websites&#x27; rankings in search engine results pages.

<doc id="1257586" wikidata="Q390234" url="?curid=1257586" title="Songs of Faith and Devotion">
<text>Songs of Faith and Devotion is the eighth studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode. It was first released on 22 March 1993 in the United Kingdom by Mute Records and a day later in the United States by Sire Records and Reprise Records. The album incorporated a more aggressive, darker rock-oriented tone than its predecessor &quot;Violator&quot; (1990), largely influenced by the emerging alternative rock and grunge scenes in the United States.

Upon its release, &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; reached number one in several countries, and became the first Depeche Mode album to debut atop the charts in both the UK and the US. To support the album, Depeche Mode embarked on the fourteen-month-long Devotional Tour, the largest tour they had undertaken to date.

Recording the album and the subsequent tour exacerbated growing tensions and difficulties within the band, prompting Alan Wilder to quit in 1995, making this album the final one with him as a band member, and also the final album of the band to be recorded as a quartet. The ordeal had exhausted their creative output following the enormous success they had enjoyed with &quot;Violator&quot;, leading to rumours and media speculation that the band would split. Depeche Mode subsequently recovered from the experience, and released &quot;Ultra&quot; in 1997.

==Background and recording==
===Background===
Depeche Mode had released their previous album &quot;Violator&quot; in early 1990 and had supported it with a world tour that lasted through the end of that year. Most of the band, coming off the &quot;peak high&quot; of a successful album and tour, took a year off before reconvening in February 1992 to record their new album. Only Wilder actively worked on music during the band&#x27;s hiatus, releasing his Recoil album &quot;Bloodline&quot; (1992) and collaborating with band Nitzer Ebb by remixing a song for their EP &quot;As Is&quot; (1991) and co-producing their album &quot;Ebbhead&quot; (1991).

===Techniques and processes===
&quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; was recorded over eight months in a rented villa in Madrid during 1992, as well as later sessions in Hamburg and London. Following his work on U2&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, producer Flood suggested the idea of building their own studio in a rented house where the band would live and work, the same process having yielded huge successes for U2. A studio was set up in the basement of the villa, with two drum kits using different spaces to achieve different sounds. The recordings from the kits could then be processed through synthesizers, such as the large Roland System 700 the band had installed in the studio. The band had become aware of getting caught in easy routines in the studio leading to boredom and thus wanted to change as many aspects to their approach to the recording as possible.

Wilder recalled on &quot;Violator&quot; the band had relied heavily on sequencing; though the album used a great deal more live recorded audio than previous Depeche Mode releases, the audio had been quantised to the exact beats of the bars, resulting in a slick but sequenced feel. For making &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;, the band wanted the sound to be looser and less programmed. Tracks such as &quot;I Feel You&quot; included drums performed live by Wilder which were then sampled and sequenced to form drum loops using Cubase, in a different structure to how they were originally performed, keeping all the dynamics and inherent mistakes of a human performance. Embellishments like reversed cymbals were added later at the behest of Wilder, who often suggested such experimentation.

Further techniques used in recording included the reversed piano on the conclusion to the track &quot;Mercy in You&quot;. The introduction of the track &quot;Judas&quot; has uilleann pipes recorded with reversed reverberation mixed into the sound, to achieve a haunting, atmospheric feel. &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot; included a piano part which was processed through a guitar processor to add distortion. A harpsichord sample was then played and recorded over the top, giving a unique, layered sound to the riff. Early demos for &quot;Condemnation&quot; included all four band members performing in the same space—Andy Fletcher bashing a flight case with a pole, producer Flood and Dave Gahan clapping, Alan Wilder playing a drum and Martin Gore playing an organ. The sound produced was very embryonic; however, it gave the band a direction as to how the track should sound. Guitars were processed through devices such as Leslie tone cabinets, originally designed for organs, to achieve different sounds.

===Recording===
Upon returning from their long break after the World Violation Tour of 1990, they found it difficult to collaborate, with several factors contributing to the more difficult atmosphere that the band experienced recording the album. The band living and working together in the same house meant that they rarely got breaks from each other as opposed to previous albums whereby the band would go to work in a studio, and then return to their respective homes or hotels at the end of each day. Fletcher described the band living together as &quot;claustrophobic&quot;, and the lack of a break from each other as a factor in contributing to the stress. Gore felt pressured to write tracks that could live up to the success of the previous album, &quot;Violator&quot;, despite encouragement from Fletcher that he wrote better under pressure. Gahan had moved to Los Angeles following &quot;Violator&quot; and had been spending time with up and coming alternative rock bands such as Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Soundgarden, which inspired him to create a rock-oriented record, leading to creative differences with the rest of the band. Gahan was also struggling with a drug at this point. The band also began to jam together, which was something which they had only previously done for fun, not in terms of album writing. The lack of success of coming up with musical ideas from such jams led to intense frustration.

Unlike the previous albums, there was very little pre-production, where the band would listen to demos created by Gore and then suggest ideas to establish a creative framework. Flood recalls the lack of pre-production as a big mistake that adversely affected the early recording sessions. Due to these frustrations, the first recording batch of four weeks was largely unusable, which Wilder described as &quot;a complete fucking waste of time&quot; in a sarcastic toast to Flood at the airport on their way back home. The lack of progress increasingly frustrated everyone involved. Flood compared the collective effort of &quot;Violator&quot; where the band would contribute as a whole, and while there were disagreements, it was in recognition that it was for a greater good, whereas in the making of &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;, the band members were highly adamant of their own individual ideas, leading to considerable tension. Flood described the atmosphere as &quot;like pulling teeth&quot; and emotionally draining. Gore, Gahan, and Daniel Miller shared his sentiments, comparing the party-like atmosphere of creating &quot;Violator&quot; to the stale atmosphere on &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;. Though Wilder would say the band members had drifted as far apart as they had ever been, the emotional stress contributed to some of Depeche Mode&#x27;s best tracks, including &quot;In Your Room&quot; and &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot;, which many felt were indicative of Gore&#x27;s greatest works.

Gahan downplayed his role on the album, stating the only thing he felt he contributed was what he considers his greatest vocal performance for &quot;Condemnation&quot;. Conversely, Wilder praised his role, stating that on previous releases, Gahan&#x27;s studio contribution was often only vocal performance, and thus did not get in the way much; but during the recording of &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; Gahan often offered a lot of positive encouragement, and Wilder&#x27;s creative differences with Gore were actually the real source of the tension in the band. Flood recalls Wilder and Gore having a very heated argument over the mix to &quot;Judas&quot;, and that there were constant disagreements throughout the recording process between the members of the band and Flood himself. Despite the feeling the band were realising one of their greatest works, Flood commented that the &quot;little things&quot; of the recording process never ran smoothly, leading to constant, largely non-constructive arguing. Conditions improved between the band when the recording sessions moved to Hamburg, largely in part as it was a return to normal studio routine, as opposed to living together.

It was during the recording of the album that Wilder decided he had to leave the band, although he wouldn&#x27;t leave until after the subsequent tour. Wilder later was comparing the friction between the members of the Beatles during the recording of their 1968 self-titled album to conditions working on &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;: &quot;We were in the worst possible state as members but we were creating some of our best work. The stories I hear about them [The Beatles] not being even in the same room together – that was very much the same with us, when one person would be in the studio and the other would be in another city, and then the next day that person would come and do their vocal and you&#x27;d go away, because you couldn&#x27;t bear to be in the same room. ... at the time, it was a living hell. During the making of that album, I really made a decision to leave the group; even though I didn&#x27;t leave until two or three years later, I remember thinking &#x27;I&#x27;m never going to make another record under these circumstances again, because it&#x27;s so much not fun&#x27;. And music should be fun – there should be some sort of enjoyment there.&quot;

The album was mixed at the Olympic Studios in London by Wilder, Flood and Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent.

==Artwork==
Overlapping each image of the band members is a symbol representing that member, in a similar style to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s fourth studio album. The symbols first appeared on the cover of lead single &quot;I Feel You&quot;, which did not feature the band members, and as such, each featured its member&#x27;s birthdate in the right-hand corner to identify the member.

==Reception==
&quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; became Depeche Mode&#x27;s first studio album to reach number one on both the UK Albums Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also topped the charts in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Switzerland.

The album received largely positive reviews from critics. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Adam Sweeting lauded Depeche Mode&#x27;s musical growth on what he deemed to be an &quot;astonishingly powerful album&quot; and &quot;a masterpiece&quot;, remarking that it &quot;kills any residual notions of them being a &#x27;synth-pop&#x27; act stone dead.&quot; David Quantick praised it in &quot;NME&quot; as a &quot;more obviously emotional and mature&quot; work than the band&#x27;s previous albums and concluded that &quot;Depeche Mode are much too interesting to avoid now that they are grown up.&quot; &quot;Q&quot;″s Andy Gill found that the album &quot;constitutes a resolute continuation of the mature experimental pop principles of &quot;Violator&quot;, with a few candles carried as torches&quot;, while in &quot;Select&quot;, Andrew Harrison said that it eschews &quot;Violator&quot;″s &quot;digital cleanliness&quot; and contains &quot;the most viscous, poisonous sound textures Depeche Mode have yet created.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the songs make desire more desperate, and more alluring, than ever.&quot;

Calling the record &quot;gloomy, pretentious and winning&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Arion Berger felt that Depeche Mode&#x27;s strengths continued to lie in &quot;style&quot; rather than &quot;concept&quot;, and thus commented that &quot;wisely... the band forgoes new concepts and does its tinkering musically&quot; instead. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Bill Wyman was less enthused, summarising the album as &quot;thinking-teen&#x27;s pop&quot; for &quot;tortured suburban youth&quot; while finding that Depeche Mode &quot;don&#x27;t really have much to say&quot; and that &quot;their computer-based soundscapes are too limited&quot;. Music critic Robert Christgau graded it a &quot;dud&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Ned Raggett wrote that apart from Alan Wilder and Flood&#x27;s &quot;new sonic tricks&quot;, &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; &quot;sounds pretty much like a Depeche Mode album&quot;, yet &quot;works incredibly well all the same&quot; and &quot;continues the Depeche Mode winning streak&quot;; he ranked it at number 18 on his list of &quot;The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties&quot; for &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; journalist Stephen Dalton called it a &quot;widescreen experiment in soulful self-laceration&quot; that &quot;lifts the Mode to a higher musical level and defies the traumatic circumstances surrounding its conception.&quot; Similarly, Danny Eccleston stated in &quot;Mojo&quot; that the album &quot;should have been rotten&quot; given its fraught creation, &quot;but DM&#x27;s momentum kept rolling.&quot; &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; was included in &quot;Q&quot;″s 1995 list &quot;In Our Lifetime: &quot;Q&quot;″s 100 Best Albums&quot;, along with &quot;Violator&quot;.

Wilder stated he felt &quot;In Your Room&quot; and &quot;Walking in My Shoes&quot; to be some of the best works the band had ever done, a sentiment agreed upon by Flood, who commented that &quot;many people&quot; involved in the project shared such sentiments. Fellow musician Gary Numan also stated that &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; was the album that saved his career, noting, &quot;[after listening to this album] [my] music changed dramatically. It became much darker. At school I was excused from religious instruction because I had no faith and &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; suddenly gave me something to write about and something to be bothered about. [...] I love Depeche Mode, always will.&quot;

==Tour==
The subsequent Devotional Tour to support the album was the largest Depeche Mode had undertaken to that point. The tour spanned fourteen months, visiting twenty-seven countries and played to over two million people over 158 dates. The tour covered 100,000 miles and required 90 tonnes of equipment. The huge scale of the tour was to cover the sponsoring costs. Anton Corbijn designed the elaborate stage design, the first time he had ever done so. The huge scale of the tour took its toll on the band members. Despite Fletcher&#x27;s comment that &quot;Dave was loving it [the tour]...he was on a different planet&quot;, his heroin addiction had increased, Gore was drinking excessively and had several seizures, Fletcher was suffering from clinical depression to the point where he was replaced by Daryl Bamonte on all dates from April and the grueling nature of touring had taken its toll on Wilder. Gore later commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone was ever the same after that tour&quot;, highlighting the tense nature of the tour, and &quot;Q&quot; magazine would later refer to the Devotional Tour as &quot;the most debauched rock tour ever&quot;.

Following the tour, the experience of &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; and the subsequent supporting tour had taken too hard a toll on Wilder, who announced his departure from the band on his 36th birthday in 1995, highlighting a highly uneven workload distribution, lack of acknowledgement from his bandmates, creative differences within the band and overall lack of cohesion. Wilder&#x27;s departure and the internal strife within the band, specifically Gahan&#x27;s growing heroin addiction led many to speculate that the band was finished. The band managed to recover from the loss of Wilder, releasing &quot;Ultra&quot; in 1997.

==2006 re-release==
A collector&#x27;s edition of &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; was released in 2006, including a bonus DVD. It was released as part of the second wave of reissues—along with &quot;A Broken Frame&quot; and &quot;Some Great Reward&quot;. The first CD was remastered and was released on a CD/SACD hybrid except for in the US where the remastered first disc was pressed to standard CD. The bonus DVD includes a 5.1 surround mix of the original album, the B-Side &quot;My Joy&quot; and the Jazz Mix of &quot;Death&#x27;s Door&quot; (basically an extended mix of the original version), as well as several other remixes.

Also included was a 36-minute documentary on &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; titled &quot;Depeche Mode: 1991–94 (We Were Going to Live Together, Record Together and It Was Going to Be Wonderful)&quot;, named after a quote from Wilder on the potential of living in their Madrid-area recording studio. It features interviews with Depeche Mode (including Wilder, who would leave the band in 1995) and other important Depeche Mode-related figures like Daniel Miller, Anton Corbijn and Daryl Bamonte. There is also footage from the film &quot;Devotional&quot; and the music videos. The documentary mainly focuses on the extreme difficulty of recording the album, and the even more frustrating fourteen-month tour that followed.

It was released on 2 October 2006 in the UK and 3 October 2006 in the US. The remastered album was released on vinyl on 2 March 2007 in Germany and on 5 March 2007 internationally.

<doc id="1257591" wikidata="Q6984333" url="?curid=1257591" title="Near–far problem">
<text>The near–far problem or hearability problem is the effect of a strong signal from a near signal source in making it hard for a receiver to hear a weaker signal from a further source due to adjacent-channel interference, co-channel interference, distortion, capture effect, dynamic range limitation, or the like. Such a situation is common in wireless communication systems, in particular CDMA. In some signal jamming techniques, the near–far problem is exploited to disrupt (&quot;jam&quot;) communications.

==Analogies==
Consider a receiver and two transmitters, one close to the receiver, the other far away. If both transmitters transmit simultaneously and at equal powers, then due to the inverse square law the receiver will receive more power from the nearer transmitter. Since one transmission&#x27;s signal is the other&#x27;s noise, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the further transmitter is much lower. This makes the farther transmitter more difficult, if not impossible, to understand. In short, the near–far problem is one of detecting or filtering out a weaker signal amongst stronger signals.

To place this problem in more common terms, imagine you are talking to someone 6 meters away. If the two of you are in a quiet, empty room then a conversation is quite easy to hold at normal voice levels. In a loud, crowded bar, it would be impossible to hear the same voice level, and the only solution (for that distance) is for both you and your friend to speak louder. Of course, this increases the overall noise level in the bar, and every other patron has to talk louder too (this is equivalent to power control runaway). Eventually, everyone has to shout to make themselves heard by a person standing right beside them, and it is impossible to communicate with anyone more than half a meter away. In general, however, a human is very capable of filtering out loud sounds; similar techniques can be deployed in signal processing where suitable criteria for distinguishing between signals can be established (see signal processing and notably adaptive signal processing).

Taking this analogy back to wireless communications, the far transmitter would have to drastically increase transmission power which simply may not be possible.

==Solutions==

In CDMA systems and similar cellular phone-like networks, the problem is commonly solved by dynamic output power adjustment of the transmitters. That is, the closer transmitters use less power so that the SNR for all transmitters at the receiver is roughly the same. This sometimes can have a noticeable impact on battery life, which can be dramatically different depending on distance from the base station. In high-noise situations, however, closer transmitters may boost their output power, which forces distant transmitters to boost their output to maintain a good SNR. Other transmitters react to the rising noise floor by increasing their output. This process continues, and eventually distant transmitters lose their ability to maintain a usable SNR and drop from the network. This process is called &quot;power control runaway&quot;. This principle may be used to explain why an area with low signal is perfectly usable when the cell isn&#x27;t heavily loaded, but when load is higher, service quality degrades significantly, sometimes to the point of unusability.

Other possible solutions to the near–far problem:
# Increased receiver dynamic range - Use a higher resolution ADC. Increase the dynamic range of receiver stages that are saturating.
# Dynamic output power control – Nearby transmitters decrease their output power so that all signals arrive at the receiver with similar signal strengths.
# TDMA – Transmitters use some scheme to avoid transmitting at the same time.

<text>Oscar Emilio Rojas Ruiz (born 27 April 1979 in San José) is a Costa Rican football midfielder or forward, who last played for Municipal Grecia.

==Club career==
Rojas made his professional debut in 1999 for Carmelita before moving abroad to play in the Primera División with La Piedad in the 2001 Invierno. He had a stint at second division Tigrillos de Nuevo León and has also played for Irapuato.

He made his return to the Primera División in 2004, joining Dorados for the 2004 Apertura. He was a mainstay in midfield with the team, starting 16 of 17 games, and scoring three goals. Rojas subsequently moved to Veracruz in summer 2005 and Jaguares Chiapas in 2006. He remained with until the end of 2008, helping the club reach the playoff series twice. He left them for a brief spell at Morelia, then dropped into the second division to play for Mérida, Indios and Toros Neza before returning to Costa Rica with Herediano ahead of the 2012 Verano championship.

===Return to Mexico===
In summer 2012, Rojas returned to La Piedad, with the club being relocated to Veracruz and recalled Tiburones Rojos. His debut was postponed when Morelia, who still owed him, did not immediately agree on the transfer. He left the club in summer 2013 after they told him he did not fit in their plans after winning promotion to Mexico&#x27;s top tier. After a few months out of a club, he joined another Mexican second division side, Estudiantes Altamira.

==International career==
Óscar Rojas made his debut for Costa Rica in a 1–0 World Cup qualification victory over Jamaica on 11 November 2001 and earned a total of 28 caps, scoring 1 goal. He represented his country in 9 FIFA World Cup qualification matches and appeared at the 2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup, but missed out on the 2002 FIFA World Cup as one of the last cuts by national coach Alexandre Guimaraes. Absent from the national team for three years, he returned to the selection in 2005, first under Jorge Luis Pinto and then under the reappointed Guimaraes and he played at the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Again, however, he was not chosen for the World Cup squad in 2006. His first international goal came against Peru national football team on 22 August 2007.

He announced his retirement from the national team on 10 April 2009. However, he was once again selected by Pinto for a match against Jamaica on 21 March 2012, making his return to the national team just weeks before his thirty-third birthday. His final international was a September 2012 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Mexico

<doc id="1257599" wikidata="Q11191558" url="?curid=1257599" title="Basal reader">
<text>Basal readers are textbooks used to teach reading and associated skills to schoolchildren. Commonly called &quot;reading books&quot; or &quot;readers&quot; they are usually published as anthologies that combine previously published short stories, excerpts of longer narratives, and original works. A standard basal series comes with individual identical books for students, a &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Edition&quot; of the book, and a collection of workbooks, assessments, and activities.

==Description==

Basal readers usually are well organized. Stories are chosen to illustrate and develop specific skills, which are taught in a pre-determined sequence. Often, new words are introduced, and then reinforced, in a very deliberate sequence to build the student’s reading vocabulary. 

The teacher&#x27;s editions are also tightly organized, containing much more than the answer key to the questions that usually appear at the end of each reading passage. The teacher&#x27;s book also contains suggestions for pre-reading and post-reading activities and assessments, as well as scripted questions to ask students at specific points in a story. The teacher’s editions usually seek to make it easier for the teacher to present, reinforce, and test the reading skills covered in the corresponding student book and student workbook.

==History==
Basal readers have been in use in the United States since the mid-1860s, beginning with a series called the McGuffey Readers. In the McGuffey Readers, the first book focused on teaching Phonics thoroughly, while later readers introduced other vocabulary, including non-phonetic “sight words”. This was the first reader published with the idea of having one text for each grade level. 

Since then, teaching methodologies in school basals have shifted regularly. The Scott Foresman Company published what is perhaps the most famous basal series, whose stories starred two children named Dick and Jane. Dick and Jane books emphasized memorizing words on sight, a method which came to be known as &quot;look and say&quot;. The competing Alice and Jerry readers also used the “look and say” method. This philosophy came under attack in the late 1950s, largely due to Rudolf Flesch&#x27;s book &quot;Why Johnny Can&#x27;t Read&quot;. This was a scathing condemnation of the &quot;look say&quot; method, and advocated a return to programs that stressed teaching phonics to beginning readers.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, the pendulum did swing back toward a more phonics-based approach. During the latter part of the 1980s, basal usage declined as reading programs began to turn to whole language and so-called balanced reading programs that relied more heavily on trade books, rather than textbooks. The 1990s and early years of the 21st century have seen a renewed interest in skills acquisition which has sparked a resurgence in basal dominance.

==Benefits==

The highly planned nature of basal readers is seen as one of their strengths, as this eases the load on teachers, particularly those who are inexperienced. Specific skills can be easily targeted, tested, and remediated. Those with very controlled vocabulary usage may ease difficulties for beginner or weak readers. Students who are reading below grade level will receive some benefits from using the on-level basal. The exposure will prepare them for state testing. Using a basal reader as a starting point for grade level reading allows educators to quickly assess student reading level. Basals are not meant to be the only resource a student uses, just the starting point.

<doc id="1257608" wikidata="Q6114271" url="?curid=1257608" title="Jack Names the Planets">
<text>&quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot; is the debut single by Ash, released in February 1994. The single was originally released on vinyl only and is entirely different from the album version that appears on their EP, &quot;Trailer&quot;. The single was re-released on 2 December 2002 in CD format as a limited edition with the Raptor 12&quot; version of &quot;Season&quot; as an extra B-side, as part of the promotion for the &quot;Intergalactic Sonic 7″s&quot; greatest hits collection.

The song first appeared on the &quot;Shed&quot; demo tape, recorded in 1992 and again on the &quot;Garage Girl&quot; and &quot;Pipe Smokin&#x27; Brick&quot; demo-tapes. Ash were first signed when a copy of &quot;Garage Girl&quot; was given to Stephen &#x27;Tav&#x27; Tavner, who signed them on the basis of &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot;.

Only 2,000 copies of the single were released, and the single was recorded on a £300 budget. However, the band was unhappy with the version released on the 1994 single, and re-recorded it for their first album.

The title of the track is taken from a chapter of the Stephen King and Peter Straub novel, &quot;The Talisman&quot;. This book is further referenced in some of the lyrics.

The single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, first appeared on the &quot;Garage Girl&quot; demo tape.

In 1995, the song appeared on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Angus&quot;. Clips from the movie were interspersed with footage of Ash performing as figures in moving posters for the video of &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot;, which was also released in 1995. Phil Harder directed the video.

The first 50,000 pressings of Ash&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;1977&quot;, began with &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Know&quot; as hidden tracks found by rewinding the CD, before the usual opener &quot;Lose Control&quot;. &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot; also appeared on Ash&#x27;s first greatest hits collection &quot;Intergalactic Sonic 7″s&quot;, and is considered a fan and band favourite. It is rare not to be included in the band&#x27;s live setlist.

During the spoken section at the beginning of the song, two Dutchmen, Oscar &quot;Wilde&quot; Vermeer and Patrick &quot;The Brewer&quot; Schrama (who met Tim Wheeler during a holiday in France), suggest that the song should have been called &quot;Jack Names The Planet Nieuw-Vennep&quot;, given that, in their opinion, &quot;Nieuw-Vennep&quot; is a good name for a planet. Nieuw-Vennep is a town of thirty thousand inhabitants in the west of the Netherlands, midway between The Hague and Amsterdam.

<doc id="1257619" wikidata="Q75091" url="?curid=1257619" title="Benxi">
<text>Benxi (, ) is a prefecture-level city located in the east of Liaoning province, People&#x27;s Republic of China, south-southeast of the provincial capital Shenyang. As of the 2020 census, its population was 1,326,018 (1,709,538 in 2010) whom 809,655 lived in the built-up area made of 3 urban districts (Pingshan, Xihu and Mingshan). It was founded as a metallurgical center in 1915. Benxi Iron and Steel Company (Bengang) is the largest employer in the city, and used to be the fourth-largest steel company in China. The second-largest industry in Benxi is coal mining. The city has pollution problems due to steel production and coal mining.

During the disaster of Air France flight AF447, Benxi Iron and Steel Company lost 5 employees, including the executive Chen Chiping who was the wife of Liaoning&#x27;s provincial governor.

==History==
As early as 400,000 years ago, there were people living in Benxi prefecture, which was indicated by Miaohou Mountain ruins with human fossils and stone tools explored in this region.

The worst coal mining disaster in the world took place on April 26, 1942 in Benxihu Colliery. A coal-dust explosion killed 1,549 miners working that day, making it the worst disaster in the history of coal mining and the second worst recorded industrial accident. The explosion sent flames bursting out of the mine shaft entrance. Miners&#x27; relatives rushed to the site but were denied entry by a cordon of Japanese guards who erected electric fences to keep them out. In an attempt to curtail the fire underground, the Japanese shut off the ventilation and sealed the pit head. Witnesses say that the Japanese did not evacuate the pit fully before sealing it, trapping many Chinese workers underground to suffocate in the smoke.

The city is home to a notable number of Manchu and Hui people.

==Administrative divisions==
Benxi contains 4 districts and 2 autonomous counties:

Within these there are 25 counties, 40 villages and towns, 229 communities and 289 village committees.

==Geography==
Benxi is located within latitude 40° 49&#x27;–41° 35&#x27; N and longitude 123° 34&#x27;–125° 46&#x27; E, and has a total area of . It is bordered by Tonghua (Jilin) to the east, Dandong to the south, Liaoyang to the west, Shenyang to the northwest, and Fushun to the north. The area has many mountains as well as a high degree of forest coverage (74%).

===Climate===

Benxi has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;), characterised by hot, humid summers, due to the East Asian monsoon, and long, cold and windy, but dry winters, due to the Siberian anticyclone. The four seasons here are distinctive. Nearly half of the annual rainfall occurs in July and August alone. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 38% in July to 63% in February, the city receives 2,325 hours of bright sunshine annually.

==Economy==
Benxi&#x27;s economy grew 10% in 2012 to a regional GDP of 111.24 billion CNY. Ranked eighth out of fourteen prefecture level cities in Liaoning, the city&#x27;s GDP accounted for approximately 4% of provincial total. Urban per-capita disposable income was 22,466 CNY, and consumption per capita 16,064 CNY.

With 46 large and medium-sized enterprises in Benxi, main industrial products are raw iron (14 million tons), steel (13 million tons), finished steel (12 million tons), cement (3 million tons) and raw coal (1 million tons). In 2008, 92,615 people were employed in manufacturing, 20,368 in education, 19,228 in public administration and social organizations, 17,913 persons in the mining industry, and 12,997 in transportation and storage. According to the type of business ownership, 63,000 were employed in private companies.

Uranium is mined in the region.

As of 2009, Asia&#x27;s biggest iron ore mine, which is reported to possess more than 3 billion tons of proven reserves, has been found in this region.

==Education==

The city contains the Benxi Campus of the Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (LNUTCM).

In the perspective of high school education, the Benxi Senior High School (Benxi Gaozhong) is located in the city, while the school faced severe controversy on the unreasonably-high number of Sporting Students. However, the currency of the school is improving with the former-principal Pang Mingrong () dismissed from the school, Pang was infamous and controversial for the injustice in his attitude towards students of different &#x27;classes,&#x27; which builds on test scores, however revered by his students.

==Tourist activities==

Benxi is rich with tourist attractions. The eastern side of the prefecture is covered with mountains, caves and lakes with low population, making the various parks in that area popular.

The Benxi Lake, located at the urban area of Xihu district in Benxi, after which the city was named in Qing dynasty, is the tiniest lake in the world. With an area less than 15 sq. meters and a daily rate of flow at approximately 20,000 tons, the lake acts as a famous tourist attraction of the city.

The Benxi Water Cave National Park is a subterranean river, some 3,000 meters long, 2 meters deep and wide enough for 20-30 boats. It flows through this cave situated east of Benxi city. The cave is filled with countless stalactites and stone flowers, pillars and curtains.

Wunü Mountain National Park is an area of natural beauty. The park also contains the remains of an ancient Goguryeo capital city. As such the site has been recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Guanmenshan National Forest Park is a valley of outstanding natural beauty. Secluded trails run up and down the valley. The area is particularly popular in autumn when the leaves of the many maple trees that line the valley turn bright red.

<text>George Anthony Hincapie (born June 29, 1973) is an American former racing cyclist, who competed professionally between 1994 and 2012. Hincapie was a key domestique of Lance Armstrong. Hincapie was also a domestique for Alberto Contador in 2007 and for Cadel Evans in 2011, when both men won the Tour de France. He was the owner and general manager of UCI Professional Continental team until it folded at the end of the 2020 season.

On October 10, 2012, Hincapie released a statement on his website acknowledging the use of performance-enhancing drugs and confirming that he had been approached by US federal investigators and USADA about his experiences with doping. Later that day a statement was released confirming his acceptance of a six-month ban from September 1, 2012, ending on March 1, 2013, along with a stripping of all race results between May 31, 2004, and July 31, 2006.

Hincapie started a record 17 Tours, however, after his doping admission he was retroactively disqualified from the 2004, 2005 and 2006 Tours. The only Tour he started but did not finish was his first. He completed his 16th and final Tour in 2012, which tied Joop Zoetemelk&#x27;s record of completed Tours. However, following the outcome of the Armstrong investigation, the record reverted to Zoetemelk. He also rode at five consecutive Olympic Games between 1992 and 2008.

==Early life==
Hincapie was born in Queens, New York, United States. His father Ricardo, a native of Colombia, introduced him to cycling, and his first race training was in New York City&#x27;s Central Park. He graduated from Farmingdale High School in Long Island in 1991.

==Cycling career==

Hincapie has several important wins of his own, starting with Gent–Wevelgem in 2001 and Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne in 2005. Also in 2005, Hincapie took two stage wins at the Critérium du Dauphiné and 2nd place at Paris–Roubaix. In 2005 he had his first stage win in the Tour de France where, on July 17, he finished seven seconds ahead of climber Óscar Pereiro to win Stage 15 from Lézat-sur-Lèze to Pla d&#x27;Adet. In January 2014, Pereiro acknowledged in a radio show that during the final climb, Hincapie turned his head and said 50,000, which Pereiro assumed was in Euros, although Hincapie was referring to U.S. dollars. Pereiro accepted the offer and sold the stage to Hincapie. The deal was closed some kilometers before arriving to the finish line. More recent victories include two stages at the Tour of California (2006), the overall and a stage at the Tour of Missouri (2007), and another stage win at the Critérium du Dauphiné in 2008. He is a three-time US Professional Road Race champion (1998, 2006, 2009).

Throughout his career Hincapie has targeted the cobbled classics of April, specifically the week that begins with the Tour of Flanders, continues mid-week with Gent–Wevelgem, and ends with Paris–Roubaix. He achieved his highest position on the podium with his 2001 victory in Gent–Wevelgem. His 2nd-place finish in the 2005 Paris-Roubaix remains the highest placing in that race by an American.

His many top 10 placings in these races include 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th (twice), 7th, and 10th in various Tour of Flanders; 3rd, 4th (three times), and 5th in Gent–Wevelgem, in addition to his victory; and 2nd, 4th (twice), 6th (twice), 8th, and 9th in Paris–Roubaix. While using Three Days of De Panne as a warm-up ride during the previous week, he has placed well in that race also, winning the overall in 2004 and placing third overall in 2002.

In 2005, Hincapie showed a talent for short individual time trials (ITTs), winning the prologue at the 2005 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, placing second three times and third once in prologues in 2006 (including at the Tour de France), and placing second in the short ITT at Three Days of De Panne. In the 2006 Paris–Roubaix, bad luck struck Hincapie in the cobbled sector of Mons-en-Pévèle, when the steerer tube of his Trek bicycle snapped, leaving him dangling with no handlebars and crashing heavily. He was near the lead group but had to abandon the race. He later won the ITT at the Eneco Tour of Benelux in 2006 and placed fourth in two longer ITTs that year. He finished third in the prologue at the 2007 Tour de France and second in the prologue at the Volta a Catalunya in 2008.

Hincapie rode for in the 2008 and 2009 seasons, departing Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team shortly before it disbanded. He is easily distinguished from the pack by his large size (). His contract with the team expired after the 2009 season, and though there was talk of him joining Armstrong&#x27;s new , Hincapie signed with for the 2010 season.
In 2012 he established the , initially with support from BMC. He also set a record by completing his 17th Tour of Flanders, surpassing Briek Schotte. On June 11, Hincapie announced that he would retire at the end of the season, after 19 years in the professional peloton. On June 30, Hincapie started a record 17th Tour de France. He was allowed to lead the race onto the Champs-Élysées as this was his final Tour de France. In August, Hincapie announced that he had raced in his last event, the USA Pro Cycling Challenge. In his own words: “It&#x27;s been a long career for me, a good career and I&#x27;m proud of it. I&#x27;m sad to leave, but at the same time, I&#x27;m excited to spend more time with my family and start a new life.” He also said that he didn&#x27;t plan to terminate all his relations with cycling. Following his retirement, Hincapie opened a boutique hotel and high-end restaurant in Travelers Rest, South Carolina with his brother.

In March, 2017, Hincapie turned to mountain biking and competed in the Masters category at the eight-day Absa Cape Epic stage race in South Africa over 641 km. The race is held in a two-person team format and Hincapie and partner Cadel Evans – reunited after Hincapie helped Evans to win the 2011 Tour de France – won the category.

==Doping==
On October 10, 2012, Hincapie announced on his website that he had used banned substances at times in his career. The statement reads in part:

The statement came as the U.S. Anti-Doping agency announced plans to release documents related to doping accusations against Lance Armstrong, a former teammate of Hincapie.

<text>Hitler Bad, Vandals Good is the seventh studio album by the southern California punk rock band The Vandals, released in 1998 by Nitro Records.

==Composition==
Much of the album is characterized by the pop-punk music and humorous lyrics for which the band is known, and it became their most popular and commercially successful album to date. While the band has utilized humor as a basis for much of their lyrical content throughout their career, the humor on their previous album &quot;The Quickening&quot; had been rooted heavily in sarcasm and dealt with themes of nihilism, anarchism and apathy. By comparison, the humor in &quot;Hitler Bad, Vandals Good&quot; is more lighthearted, dealing with subjects such as girlfriends, fast food and hairstyles.

The album contains two cover songs. &quot;Come Out Fighting&quot; was originally performed by fellow southern California punk rock band Pennywise and is dedicated to the memory of Pennywise bassist Jason Matthew Thirsk, who had committed suicide the previous year. &quot;So Long, Farwell&quot; is a Rodgers and Hammerstein song from the musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, which has here been re-interpreted using electric guitar, bass and drums as the closing song on the album.

==Release==
&quot;Hitler Bad, Vandals Good&quot; was released in June 1998. In November 1999, the band toured South America with the Offspring. An independent music video was later filmed for the song &quot;My Girlfriend&#x27;s Dead.&quot; Two different videos were released: One features the band members and was filmed as part of the Kung Fu Films movie &quot;That Darn Punk&quot; in 2000, while the other is a fan-created animated video that was included on one of Kung Fu Records&#x27; DVD releases.

<doc id="1257636" wikidata="Q704279" url="?curid=1257636" title="Robert (footballer, born 1981)">
<text>Robert de Pinho de Souza (born 27 February 1981), simply known as Robert, is a Brazilian former footballer who played for as a striker.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Born in Salvador, Robert began his professional career with Botafogo de Ribeirão Preto of Brazil, where he played in 2001. He made a move to São Caetano in 2002.
On 14 March 2003, Robert signed for Spartak Moscow on loan until the end of the 2003 season. After less than a season with Spartak, however, he returned to the Americas, signing with Club Atlas. He did well in his first season with Atlas, scoring 16 goals in 21 games during the 2004 Clausura. He repeated his performance in the 2004 Apertura, leading them to the semifinals of the liguilla, where they were eliminated by UNAM Pumas.

===PSV Eindhoven===
Robert moved from Atlas to PSV Eindhoven for £2 million, in January 2005. He made 32 league appearances, scoring 7 goals. During the UEFA Champions League quarter-final match against Olympique Lyonnais, he delivered his decisive spot-kick which sent his team into a semi-final showdown with eventual losing finalist AC Milan. Although he hardly had the time to impress in the Champions League games, he played an excellent match against the Italian giants in the return leg at Philips Stadion, with PSV winning 3–1 and being ousted on away goals, and he himself came close to scoring when he cracked a long range shot which just missed the Milan left post.

===Real Betis===
Robert was loaned by PSV to Real Betis for years for €1 million fee, arriving during the 2006 January transfer window. His signing was pivotal in the efforts of Betis to avoid relegation, scoring 7 La Liga goals, including two against Villarreal in a 2–1 win at El Madrigal and a winning penalty against bitter rivals Sevilla FC in a 2–1 win at the Manuel Ruiz de Lopera. Robert also scored one UEFA Cup goal against AZ Alkmaar. Due to the injury of fellow Brazilian and teammate Ricardo Oliveira, Robert&#x27;s importance to Betis gradually grew, as he finished the club&#x27;s top goalscorer for the season. His second season, however, was poorer (still managed 9 league goals in 29 appearances) and he eventually left Real Betis in July 2007, despite Betis excised the option to buy Robert from PSV for €3.25 million on 4 April (effective on 1 July). Moreover, Robert refused to sign a contract, making the transfer collapsed. He joined Al-Ittihad as a free agent. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that despite the collapse of the transfer, Betis still had to pay €1,562,500 as compensation to PSV.

===CF Monterrey===
On 22 August 2007, Robert signed for Saudi Arabian team Al-Ittihad. On 4 December 2007 Mexican media announced the transfer of Robert to the Mexican football club CF Monterrey, where he was paired up in attack with Chilean goalscorer Humberto &quot;Chupete&quot; Suazo.

===Tecos UAG===
In Tecos, he had mild success and ended the tournament with 5 goals. Tecos were eliminated in the quarterfinals and Robert de Pinho was sent to Club America.

===Palmeiras===
In July 2009, Robert joined Palmeiras and in the Série A he scored 5 goals in 12 matches coming as a substitute in all of them. In 2009, he played a good role as a substitute in the league becoming an important player in the squad.
In 2010 Robert remained with Palmeiras and became the key striker in the team. On 21 February 2010, he scored two headed goals against Paulista rival São Paulo and Palmeiras won the match by 2–0; it was a great appearance for Robert after he had been criticised in the beginning of the Campeonato Paulista, where he scored already 5 goals. On 14 March 2010, Robert completed perfect hat-trick against Santos and Palmeiras won the match by 4–3; this game was marked by the different type of commemoration after goals. By the end of this game, Robert came to be known as &quot;Blade do Palestra&quot; due to his resemblance to actor Wesley Snipes, who played the character Blade in a trilogy of films.

===Cruzeiro===
On 3 June 2010, Cruzeiro Belo Horizonte signed the striker of Palmeiras property, but he arrived on a six-month-loan from CF Monterrey.

===Puebla===
It was announced on 8 June 2011 that de Pinho was signed to Puebla. This was made public during the &quot;2011 Super Summer Draft&quot; held in Cancun.

===Jeju United===
On 16 January 2011, Robert joined South Korean K-League side Jeju United.

<text>The Pelham Bridge is a bascule bridge located in the New York City borough of the Bronx, just downstream of the railroad Pelham Bay Bridge. It carries Shore Road and a walkway along the downstream side, over the Hutchinson River. The bridge is operated and maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation. Crossing the mouth of the river, it is variously called Pelham Bay Bridge and Pelham Bridge. The BL45 to/from Eastchester in Westchester County as well as the Bx29, which operates between City Island and Co-op City, operates over this bridge.

The Pelham Bridge opens for maritime traffic frequently; in 2014, it opened 724 times. The watercraft traffic under that bridge is greater than for any other drawbridge in the city.

==History==

The first bridge at the site, a stone bridge built in 1815, was destroyed in a storm on April 12, 1816. Another bridge was not built at the site for eighteen years.

The current bridge replaced an older one that required constant, expensive maintenance. The new bridge was opened to traffic on October 15, 1908 before it was fully completed, in order to save costs on maintaining the old bridge. During construction, the water main for City Island and Pelham Bay Park had to be interrupted, so water was imported from New Rochelle, costing the city $5,323.93. The bridge was completed on February 17, 1909. at a total cost of $605,274.06. The bridge was reconstructed in 1985.

A celebration of the bridge&#x27;s centennial took place on October 28, 2008.

<doc id="1257676" wikidata="Q941391" url="?curid=1257676" title="Snohomish people">
<text>The Snohomish people (, , ) are a Lushootseed-speaking Southern Coast Salish people who are indigenous to the Puget Sound region of Washington State. Most Snohomish are enrolled in the Tulalip Tribes of Washington and reside on the reservation or nearby, although others are enrolled in other tribes, and some are members of the non-recognized Snohomish Tribe of Indians. Traditionally, the Snohomish occupied a wide area of land, including the Snohomish River, parts of Whidbey and Camano Islands, and the nearby coastline of Skagit Bay and Puget Sound. They had at least 25 permanent villages throughout their lands, but in 1855, signed the Treaty of Point Elliott and were relocated to the Tulalip Reservation. Although some moved to the reservation, the harsh conditions, lack of land, and oppressive policies of the United States government caused many to leave. 

The Snohomish today are descended from several groups, including the N&#x27;Quentlmamish and Sdodohobsh, among others. Each group was traditionally independent at the village level, but there was a greater cultural connection, and all called themselves Snohomish. They had a strong conception of their territory, and formed strong alliances between each other and outside with other peoples through marriage and diplomacy, which allowed their reach to extend far beyond their territory. Throughout the summer, they traveled across their territory and beyond to hunt, gather, and fish, while the winter was reserved for religious observances and ceremonies. Today, the Snohomish maintain their tradition of potlatching, as well as other cultural elements such as use of canoes, fishing, hunting, and gathering of traditional materials for cultural crafts.

Traditionally, the Snohomish spoke a subdialect of Northern Lushootseed, although it has fallen out of use in favor of English in more modern times. The Tulalip Tribes are in the process of revitalizing the language, as well as preserving and restoring other traditional cultural teachings, which are known in Lushootseed as .

== Name and etymology ==
&quot;Snohomish&quot; is an anglicization of the Lushootseed name . Around the time of contact, a linguistic shift occurred where nasal consonants, such as m or n, shifted in many words to become b or d respectively. This is seen in many of the pronunciations of the oldest speakers of Lushootseed, some of which still pronounced words in the old way. When the Snohomish first encountered Europeans, their name was pronounced as &quot;snuhumš&quot;, producing the word &quot;Snohomish&quot; in English. After some time, the Lushootseed changed, while the English-language name stayed the same, creating the discrepancy that exists today.

The name &quot;Snohomish&quot; () was traditionally used to refer to all those who lived in villages on southern Whidbey and Camano Islands, Hat Island, the coast of Puget Sound from Warm Beach to Muckilteo, and along the Snohomish River until Snohomish City. There were many villages and subgroups within the Snohomish proper, but they all had a level of social cohesion above their own village. In total, the Snohomish had 15 villages around their territory.

The meaning of the word has been debated by linguists and tribal historians. According to the Tulalip Tribes and several ethnologists and historians, the name means &quot;many men&quot; or &quot;lots of people.&quot; William Shelton, a prominent leader of the Snohomish people in the early 20th century, said that it meant &quot;lowland people&quot;.

Snohomish has also been anglicized many other ways, including Sdoh-hobsh, Sdohobc, Sinahomish, and Sneomuses. Today, Snohomish County, the city of Snohomish, and the Snohomish River are all named after the Snohomish people.

== Classification and subgroups ==
The Snohomish are a Southern Coast Salish people, like most of their neighbors. The Coast Salish are a related group of disparate peoples who speak related languages and share elements of culture, religion, and stories. The Southern Coast Salish branch includes all Lushootseed-speaking peoples and the Twana, extending over all of Puget Sound, except for the westernmost shore of Admiralty Inlet.

The Snohomish today are descended from several peoples, including the Snohomish proper, the Sdodohobsh, and the N&#x27;Quentlmamish. Some ethnographers and historians have historically considered the Skykomish and the Sktalejum to be subgroups of the Snohomish as well, due to their close ties with the Snohomish, with many Snohomish people seeing the Skykomish as an offshoot group. The Snohomish themselves were placed under the Snoqualmie as subordinates during treaty negotiations, a fact many Snohomish deeply resented. Each subgroup was historically independent from one another, not seen as united under the Snohomish as they are today. Furthermore, each subgroup was composed of several independent villages who were tied together based on shared drainage systems and a complex network of alliances between families. In addition, all the people who came from island villages were known as &quot;,&quot; however this was not an ethnic term, and purely a geographical identifier.

The (&quot;people of &quot;), also called the Whidbey Island Snohomish, were a wealthy people, widely famous throughout Puget Sound. They had several villages on the southern half of Whidbey Island. Some ethnographers disagree on whether they were a subgroup of the Snohomish or part of the Snohomish proper.

The Quil Ceda people () were those who came from the many villages in the vicinity of Quil Ceda Creek, including the village at Priest Point.

The Sdodohobsh (), also known as the Upper Snohomish or Monroe people, hailed from three independent villages in the vicinity of Monroe. Their name, , means &quot;little Snohomish.&quot; They were a low-class group, compared to the high-class Snohomish proper.

The name N&#x27;Quentlmamish (, also spelled Kwehtlamamish) refers to all those who lived in villages along the Pilchuck River (). Their territory included the Pilchuck River drainage, including Little Pilchuck Creek and Lake Stevens. They had two villages, and have sometimes been referred to as the Pilchuck people. Like the Sdodohobsh, they were low-class, seen by the Snohomish as mean and isolative. They were party to the Treaty of Point Elliot, as a subgroup of the Snohomish, and their land was ceded by Patkanim, a Snoqualmie.

The Sktalejum () have sometimes been classed as a Snohomish subgroup, other times as a Skykomish subgroup, and other times as a Snoqualmie subgroup. Their three villages were located on the Skykomish River, above Monroe. Once a powerful group, they were decimated by Smallpox epidemics and left to live in other villages. They were party to the Treaty of Point Elliott, where signed the treaty for them.

The Quadsack, also called the Kwatsakwbixw (), were a group who lived on Hat Slough. They had just one village, and have been variously considered a subgroup of the Snohomish or of the Stillaguamish. Although they were once an independent group, they were closely related to both the Snohomish and the Stillaguamish, and got absorbed after the Smallpox epidemics.

==History==
=== Pre-contact ===
For thousands of years, the Snohomish hunted, fished, and gathered around their territory. Ethnologist Colin Tweddell estimated that the pre-contact Snohomish population was in the thousands, possibly over 6,000. In the early 1800s, there were smallpox and measles epidemics which ravaged the population.

Around 1820, several Snohomish villages were decimated by a large landslide at Camano Head (), the southern tip of Camano Island. A massive landslide occurred when the bluff collapsed, burying a village directly below it. Another village on Hat Island () was wiped out by a large tidal wave caused by the landslide. Residents of the village at saw the landslide happen, and some managed to escape to higher ground before the impact of the wave. The wave also almost destroyed the largest Snohomish village of . The landslide was catastrophic, with hundreds of casualties. It was during the clamming season, and many who were visiting and were buried and drowned.

Around 1824, the Snohomish had been warring with the Klallam and Cowichan people for some time. In December of that year, they met the trading party of John Work, a Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trader. The Snohomish were among the tribes that later traded with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at Fort Nisqually, established in 1833 at the southern tip of Puget Sound. They also met Roman Catholic missionaries who entered their lands in the early 1840s.

===Treaty of Point Elliot===

In 1855, a council was held at what is now Mukilteo, Washington () in order for then-Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens to draft a treaty that would cede the lands of the people living in the northern Puget Sound region to the United States. The Snohomish were party to this treaty, and about 350 Snohomish attended. During the treaty process, the Snohomish were made subordinate to the Snoqualmie by Stevens, and the treaty was signed for the Snohomish by Patkanim (), a Snoqualmie leader. This was widely resented by the Snohomish. Patkanim, along with nine Snohomish &quot;sub-chiefs,&quot; authorized the cession of all Snohomish lands to the United States.

During the 1855-1856 Puget Sound War, the Snohomish remained neutral. This upset American authorities, who felt that the Snohomish were &quot;doing nothing&quot; for the American government, and one Indian Agent recommended that the tribe be &quot;disbanded.&quot; During this period, the Snohomish were encouraged to remove to a temporary reservation on Whidbey Island, so as to lessen the influence of the tribes fighting the American government.

According to Article 2 of the treaty, the original plan for the Snohomish under the treaty was that they would be relocated to a temporary Snohomish reservation, alongside the Skykomish, Snoqualmie, and Stillaguamish peoples. However, the treaty commission vastly underestimated the number of people who were living along the Snohomish and Stillaguamish drainage systems. In 1854, the treaty commission were under the impression that there were less than 400 people living along both watersheds. By 1856, reports said that the number of people living along the rivers was as high as 1,800. The two sections of land (1,280 acres) set apart for the Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skykomish, and Stillaguamish peoples was wholly inadequate according to anthropologist Barbara Lane, and all four tribes would never have been able to support themselves on such a reservation. 

At a later date, the Tulalip Reservation was established, as outlined in Article 3. It was originally planned to be a 36-section parcel of land to which all peoples living in western Washington would be relocated. The Tulalip Reservation encompassed the Snohomish reservation, and it was incorporated into the Tulalip Reservation. On December 3, 1873, the Tulalip Reservation was expanded by an executive order. It was enlarged to 24,320 acres.

=== Reservation Era ===
Although the Tulalip Reservation was initially chosen for its timber and nearby sawmill, funds were never given to rebuild the dilapidated sawmill. Not only that, but in 1874 it became illegal for the residents of the reservation to actually log their own forests, and all work on the reservation was disallowed. This resulted in many leaving the reservation to find logging jobs elsewhere. Eventually, logging was made legal again, but by 1883, most of the forests on the reservation had been logged. Parts of the reservation that weren&#x27;t forested, about 1,200 acres, were swampland, and the intent was for the residents to drain the swampland for farming. However, the soil quality was poor, and little funding was given for draining the swamps. Because of these problems, the Indian Agent at the time wrote: &quot;possessed of few resources which are likely to kindle the flame of jealousy in the whites, it is preeminently the most proper selection which the Government has ever made for an Indian Reservation.&quot;

The Tulalip Reservation was severely overcrowded. Although people were trying to move to the reservation as required, there simply was not enough land. By 1909, the Tulalip Reservation had been completely allotted. Some lost their allotted land, while others never got any allotment at all. Most Snohomish did in fact relocate to the Tulalip reservation early on, however, due to the lack of land, most returned to their traditional homelands. In 1919, 360 Snohomish lived off-reservation, twice as many as those living on-reservation. 

In addition to the overcrowding, disease, and lack of work, the oppressive policies of the American government, including suppression of traditional language and religion, caused many people to leave the reservation during the early reservation period.

In 2008 membership in the unrecognized Snohomish Tribe of Indians had increased to 1,200, although it is unknown what percentage of the members are Snohomish. As of 2023, there are at least 5,100 members of the Tulalip Tribes, the majority of whom are of Snohomish ancestry.

== Territory and villages ==
The core of Snohomish territory was the lower Snohomish River, particularly the area near the mouth. The historical extent of Snohomish territory stretched over Snohomish, King, and Island counties, including Whidbey Island, Camano Island, Hat Island, the eastern shoreline of Puget Sound, the Snohomish River, and the lower reaches of the Skykomish River. The Snohomish controlled the entirety of Whidbey Island south of a portage at what is now Greenbank (). It also encompassed most of Camano Island, controlling the western side of the island south of Point Demock and the eastern side south of Livingston Bay (). On the mainland, the southernmost border of Snohomish territory along the coast was at what is now Richmond Beach, south of Edmonds. The northernmost border encompassed Warm Beach (), and continued easterly to Jordan and southerly to Granite Falls. To the east and west, Snohomish territory encompasses the entire Snohomish River drainage, excluding the Snoqualmie River, and including the Skykomish River to just downriver of Elwell Creek. The eastern boundary is generally the small mountain range between Mount Pilchuck and Bald Mountain.

Like other Puget Sound tribes, the Snohomish historically had a strong conception of their territory and its boundaries. People were aware of tribal boundaries and where they were, and there was mutual respect for the boundaries of other tribes. Alliances and friendship between nations allowed for arrangements which could allow others to cross into the territory of one&#x27;s group. Through this system of alliances, the Snohomish allowed other allied peoples to use certain areas of their territory. Snohomish-controlled areas on Whidbey Island were shared with the Skagit, the Kikiallus, the Snoqualmie, and the Suquamish. The Stillaguamish, Snoqualmie, and Kikiallus were allowed to use certain areas of Snohomish Camano Island. The Snoqualmie and Duwamish were allowed to visit Hat Island. Tulalip Bay was shared with the Stillaguamish and Snoqualmie, and the southern Puget Sound coast owned by the Snohomish was shared with their southern Duwamish neighbors. Likewise, many of these groups allowed the Snohomish to visit their lands for hunting, fishing, and gathering in return.

=== Villages ===
The Snohomish and their associated groups permanently occupied at least 25 villages throughout their territory. Villages were composed of at least one longhouse, and larger villages such as often had smaller houses and a potlatch house () for specifically for ceremonies. Some villages, notably the village at , had large cedar palisades which protected the village. Low class villages, such as the village at , did not.

== Culture ==
=== Religion ===
One of the primary beliefs of traditional Snohomish religion is in the spirit power or guardian spirit (). Spirit powers are used in many ways, from daily activities to warfare. For example: a hunter might sing their spirit song during their hunt, and if they heard the spirit singing back, they would be successful. Certain professions were only open to those with certain helpful spirits. Traditionally, Snohomish children were trained from a very young age to go on a spirit power journey () to remote locations where they would receive a power. Popular places to get spirit powers were at Stevens Pass and Lake Getchel in the Cascades. Generally, a spirit quest would take place during the spring, and it was best done during a storm. In order to acquire a spirit power, one had to do something challenging. This usually involved fasting, bathing many times a day, and diving deep into water. The longer someone fasted, or the more difficult the challenges they overcame, the more powerful spirit they would obtain. Spirits could also be obtained later in life due to overcoming personal challenges or developing skills. Traditionally, both women and men could get spirits, although men tended to get more powerful spirits.

The winter was historically a common time for many religious ceremonies, but especially prominent was the winter spirit power ceremony (). In Snohomish religion, spirit powers travel around the world but return during the winter. When a spirit power returns, a person feels sick and hears their spirit power song. When this happens, one would traditionally host a large ceremony, often lasting several days, in which they would sing, dance, and give out gifts to friends and family. Unlike other ceremonies where people sang their spirit power songs alone, in this ceremony, friends were invited to help sing and dance. At the end of this ceremony, a person would usually give a potlatch.

Snohomish religion also features the , which is a type of spirit in the shape of a board. The tradition emerged in the Puget Sound region during the early historic period and a Snohomish woman claimed to be the first to get it. The boards are painted red and black and were about one-and-a-half feet long with a hole in it. This spirit is said to help people in catching fish, as well as searching for people lost in the woods. During the winter ceremony, people with this spirit did not perform their spirit dance themselves; rather, they hired four men to dance for them in pairs. In each pair, one danced with a larger board and one danced with a smaller board, putting their hand through the hole in the board and dancing counter-clockwise. The dances traditionally lasted four days and four nights, and the songs were sung four times fast and four times slow.

Traditionally, the most powerful and desired spirit powers was (also spelled or ). This spirit power is primarily a wealth spirit which helps one acquire wealth and property in life. Someone with was said to receive more gifts during a potlatch than others. Another highly powerful spirit is , which is a war spirit which came to people in time of war or courage. People with often were great and famous warriors. Both of these spirits were found only in deep water. The only spirit which one did not ever want to meet was the (Ayahos). The Ayahos is a highly-powerful elk-snake spirit which as two horns which lives in the forest. Hunters which follow this spirit are believed to die soon after meeting it.

Also a feature of traditional Snohomish religion are shamanistic spirits. Shamans, also called doctors, (), are marked by their ability to get unique spirits which can be used to heal or hurt people. Traditionally, a did not have a winter dance, and their spirits are said to remain with them at all times. Unlike many other Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Coast, the Snohomish did not have secret societies for their shamans. The traditional belief is that shamans can cure people from many things, but those wounded in war could not be cured by a shaman, only by their own spirit powers. Shamans could also restore the spirit of a person who had their spirit power stolen. It was said that a shaman showed their power by wearing a stone or belt which could turn into a snake.

After colonization, many Snohomish also converted to the Indian Shaker Church, a syncretic Christian denomination. A Shaker church was built at Tulalip.
=== Architecture ===
The main dwelling of the Snohomish was the winter longhouse. Longhouses were often between one-hundred to two-hundred feet long. The Snohomish had two types of longhouses as identified by their roof shape: the slanted shed-roof houses and the triangular gable-roof houses. Longhouses were constructed out of long cedar planks tied to vertical posts for support. Houses were divided into rooms for each family. Inside the longhouse, the house posts were carved and painted by the oldest member of the family, and cattail mats were hung over the walls for insulation and storage. Two rows of sleeping platforms were around the wall, and above them were located storage shelves where provisions, blankets, and other belongings were stored. Fireplaces were never in the center of the house, but rather were located around the sides to allow for easy passage throughout the entire house. A replica of a traditional shed-roof longhouse was constructed at the Hibulb Cultural Center for gatherings and storytelling. The Gathering Hall at Tulalip Bay is inspired by the design of a traditional gable-roof longhouse.

Longhouses were owned by those who built it, with many longhouses being owned by the whole community. In larger longhouses with partitions, each room would be owned by one or several families. Other longhouses were owned by just one man and his family, all living in the longhouse.

The potlatch house was a special type of longhouse that wealthier communities could afford. Although any longhouse could be used for potlatches, large and wealthy communities often elected to build special longhouses exclusively for potlatching. Such houses were constructed in a similar fashion to normal houses, but had generally no partitions inside. The largest Snohomish potlatch house was located at . A large shed-roof house, it was 115 feet long and 43 feet wide, with ten carved house posts.

The Snohomish also built smaller, temporary summer lodgings. They were square shaped, either like a lean-to or with a gabled roof. It was constructed of a frame with large mats stacked on top of each other and overlapped to be waterproof to form the roof and walls. Generally, only one family at a time occupied a summer house.

=== Sustenance ===
Food was always abundant on Puget Sound before colonization, and the traditional diet of the Snohomish was well-rounded. The Snohomish took steelhead, dog, pink, sockeye, and king salmon, as well as trout, sturgeon, and flounder, on the lakes, rivers, and saltwater. Many types of shellfish such as clams, cockles, and mussels were gathered on the coast. Bear, deer, beaver, elk, goat, and duck, and goose were all hunted in the surrounding forests. Fish was mainly dried, while meat was both smoked and dried. 

Fishing is highly important to the Snohomish, and there are many traditional techniques used to catch many types of fish, both in rivers and on the saltwater. The most famous method of fishing on the river is with weirs (). Weirs were built over a river so that one could walk on the platform and lower a dip-net () down into the trapped fish. Traps, hooks, and spears were used as well. Flare fishing, using flares made of pine chips, was done on rivers at night.

Plant resources were also widely used. Roots and berries, as well as certain native vegetables were gathered in the prairies, forests, and marshes. Berries, especially blackberries, were dried and made into cakes for dessert, or for future use. Flour and potatoes were also added to the diet, obtained through trade with settlers.

The Snohomish domesticated and kept the native Salish Wool Dog (), which were sheared for their wool. The wool was highly valuable and could be made into clothing and blankets. According to ethnologist Colin Tweddell, the Snohomish were the center of the woolly-dog craft among the Coast Salish. The Snohomish also made blankets out of feathers and fireweed, as well as from high-quality mountain goat wool caught high in the Cascade Mountains. 

=== Trade and transportation ===

The Snohomish were central in the trade of mountain goat wool and dog wool to many saltwater groups which had limited access to such resources. The Snohomish sold large quantities of mountain goat wool and blankets to the Indigenous peoples of Vancouver Island, in particular. 

A common currency used by the Snohomish was shell money, called dentalium or solax. While many tribes had to trade for shells, the Snohomish were able to gather some types in their own territory, although certain shells did have to be traded. Shells were strung together with a string, and some high-class people wore shells as jewelry, on the end of a necklace or as earrings.

The canoe was the primary method of transportation in historic times. Even today, they are widely used in cultural contexts. Traditionally, the Snohomish utilized five types of canoes. The largest kind was the Quinault-style canoe, an ocean-going canoe manufactured by the Quinault, who traded it to the Snohomish. It could hold as many as 60 people. The smaller Nootka-style canoe (), also called the war canoe or Chinook canoe, was a saltwater canoe originally from the Makah, but was widely adopted by the Snohomish for traveling. The Snohomish painted this canoe black on the outside, and red on the inside. It could carry as many as fifteen people. A smaller variant of this canoe, the , was made for women and hauling trade goods. The Nootka-style canoe replaced a similar type of canoe, the , which was manufactured natively by the Snohomish. The Snohomish used two types of canoes for river travel, the river canoe and the shovel-nose canoe. The river canoe () was the smallest of the two, usually built for two people, and was made to look like the larger canoes. It was used most commonly for duck hunting and fishing. The more common shovel-nose canoe () was used widely by the Snohomish for quick river travel and for fishing.

=== Traditional clothing and appearance ===
In the summer, Snohomish men generally wore long pants made of buckskin, fastened with a belt made also of buckskin or otter skin. Men wore shirts with or without sleeves which were trimmed with otter skin. Women wore long cedar-bark skirts and long-sleeved shirts made of buckskin. Women also used cedar-bark capes to shield themselves from the rain. Both men and women wore capes of bearskin or sealskin, fastened with pins of bone or yew, and both men and women wore moccasins or went barefoot. Both men and women wore cedar basket hats, which were secured with buckskin chin straps. In the winter, men wore warm racoon-skin hats with fur.

Snohomish women wore their hair parted down the middle and hung lose on each side, covering the ear. Below the ear it was braided. Men wore their hair parted down the middle and tied in a knot at the neck. When at work or at war, men tied their hair in a bun at the top of their head, which was decorated with shell money. High-class men decorated their hair for ceremonies, braiding otter skin into the hair and painting it red. Very young children wore their hair loose. A slave&#x27;s hair was cut short.

Both men and women painted their faces with red paint to prevent chapping and to keep the skin cool during summer. Paint was sometimes in decorative designs representing one&#x27;s spirit powers. Women also tattooed their arms and legs, but there was no religious significance.

== Society ==

=== Sociopolitical organization ===
The highest level of regular political organization was traditionally that of the village. The extended family was one of the most important parts of the fabric of traditional Snohomish society. The extended family was made up of several related families who lived in the same house, divided into sections for each family. Some large houses fit multiple extended families. Families made a complex web of alliances through marriage, which secured hunting, fishing, and gathering rights at preferable locations.

Like other Puget Sound tribes, the Snohomish traditionally did not have chiefs. Rather, there were high-ranking nobles who guided village affairs and resolved disputes, however, they did not have executive authority over anyone. In specific scenarios, like hunting parties or war parties, specific leaders could be appointed who had a higher level of authority during that activity. War leaders had high amounts of authority over warriors, but no one else, and still listened to other high-ranking people for counsel. In matters of law and justice, parties sent orators who decided on appropriate payment to settle the dispute. A dispute left unsettled could lead to war. A common show of friendship after a dispute would have two tribes cut up blankets together and weave the other people&#x27;s blanket wool into the tribe&#x27;s own blankets.

Later, after the contact period, Snohomish society began to shift into a more hierarchical system. A system evolved where one chief at who led all the Snohomish villages and governed with the help of various subchiefs. The role was generally hereditary. Despite this, the chief did not have absolute authority, and matters were decided by majority vote at council. One such chief in this era was William Shelton, who was the last hereditary chief of the Snohomish before the eventual abolition of the hereditary chiefdom.

Today, the Snohomish are part of the Tulalip Tribes, which have their own governmental systems.

Traditionally, Snohomish society was made up of a class system composed of three classes: high-class (), low-class (), and slaves (). Slaves were prisoners of war, and, although they could not legally gain their freedom by themselves, it was possible (although uncommon) for the children of a slave to gain their freedom through a beneficial marriage. Otherwise, the children of an enslaved person were also to be slaves. Sometimes, a slave&#x27;s family might buy them freedom if they could afford it. Enslaved children participated in the religious life as did other children, and those that got powerful spirit powers as they grew up were respected and treated as equals by their masters. The Snohomish never killed their slaves ritually or as punishment, unlike other Puget Sound peoples.
=== Potlatch ===

Potlatches () are large intra-tribal gatherings which have long been practiced by the Snohomish and other neighboring Coast Salish peoples. The potlatch was the foundation of the economy prior to colonization, and today remains a very important cultural element of the Snohomish people. Traditional potlatches were essentially feasts for the purposes of gift-giving. Potlatches were held for many reasons, including (but not limited to) for a naming ceremony, for a funeral, after a successful hunt, for a marriage, for settlement of a debt or quarrel, or for celebrating a salmon run. Throwing an extravagant potlatch by giving away essentially all of one&#x27;s possessions was highly respected and made someone widely famous. Traditionally, the potlatch cycle was used to strengthen alliances and relationships with nearby peoples. The potlatch cycle was also shared by the various villages of the Snohomish, solidifying their own inter-village connections. Among the Snohomish, the main potlatch houses were at , , , and . Other villages had potlatch houses as well, including at , , , and . It is likely that there were more potlatch houses before the population decline due to smallpox. Certain houses were built during the early colonial period, such as the potlatch house at .

A traditional potlatch generally saw the invitation of hundreds of people from local villages as well as distant villages. A traditional potlatch had an extensive welcome ceremony, in which each arriving group had its own day for welcome. When they arrived, they were greeted by a dance, to which the arriving group would respond with a song. After the welcome ceremonies for all groups, there would be feasting, dancing, and singing. Distribution of gifts (i.e. &quot;potlatching&quot;) was common, but did not (and do not) happen at every potlatch. Potlatches also traditionally included long speeches by famous orators, who were given gifts for their speeches. People displayed their spirit powers by singing power songs or by performing tricks. 

=== Yearly cycle ===
Although the Snohomish had permanent lodgings, they were only semi-sedentary. The traditional Snohomish lifestyle involved a year-long cycle of hunting, fishing, and gathering, all across their territory and beyond. Some remained at their villages year-round, especially the sick and elderly, but most people participated in the seasonal gathering cycle each year. One of the factors in the unity of the various Snohomish villages was the common participation in the yearly cycle in the same areas. The cycle began in spring, as people began to gather salmonberries in the lowlands of the Cascades. By summer, people traveled widely throughout the territory for hunting, fishing, berrying, clamming, and gathering all around the islands and the coastline of the Sound. Some also traveled into Stevens Pass to berry during the later months of the summer season. Around August, people would travel inland to hunt elk and prepare for the salmon runs. In the early fall, salmon began running throughout Snohomish territory, and upriver fishing commenced. Hunters also widened their focus to deer, bear, beaver, and other animals during this time. In the late fall, as people returned to their villages for the winter, people would travel far upriver into Skykomish territory to hunt mountain goats in the Cascades. The winter was a time of religious ceremony as well as craftwork and building until the spring, with fishing for steelhead taking place in January.

In modern times, as more people began to be employed in hop fields, the summer months became a time of traveling to the fields to work before heading home for the winter.

== Language ==

The language of the Snohomish is Lushootseed, a Coast Salish language spoken by many different peoples throughout Puget Sound. Lushootseed is split into two main dialect areas, Northern, and Southern, each of which is split into various subdialects.The Snohomish dialect (also called the Tulalip dialect today) is a subdialect of Northern Lushootseed which has characteristics of both Northern and Southern Lushootseed, due to its location on the border between the two main dialects. Although usage of the language has declined in favor of English, the Tulalip Tribes work towards revitalizing the language to daily use and promoting traditional cultural knowledge called . The Tribes offer Lushootseed language classes in local schools, and also have held Catholic Mass in the language.

==Successor tribes==
=== Tulalip Tribes of Washington ===
Most Snohomish are now enrolled in the federally-recognized Tulalip Tribes of Washington. The Tulalip Tribes is successor-in-interest to several groups, including (but not limited to) the Snohomish, Skykomish, and the Snoqualmie. The Snoqualmie are also represented by the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe, which fought for and subsequently won federal recognition for themselves, and are also as the successor-in-interest to the aboriginal Snoqualmie peoples.

The Tulalip Tribes operate two casinos, Quil Ceda Creek Casino and the Tulalip Resort Casino. The Tulalip Tribes also administrate the only tribal municipality in the country, Quil Ceda Village (), and operate the Hibulb Cultural Center, a cultural center and museum. They also have several schools within Marysville School District, as well as a Montessori school and several early childhood education and other welfare and education programs for children and adults. In 2006, the Tribes employed 2,400 people in total. 
Each year, the Tulalip Tribes participate in the Tribal Canoe Journey, an intra-tribal culture event held across Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. In 2003, the Tulalip Tribes were the host nation. They celebrate Treaty Day on the weekend nearest January 22, and hold powwows and traditional celebrations throughout the year. The Tulalip Tribes also have Smokehouse religion facilities.

The Tulalip Reservation, established for the Snohomish and other groups (including those waiting for previously promised reservations) by the Treaty of Point Elliot, is west of the city of Marysville, is located on traditional Snohomish territory. However, most enrolled members today live off the reservation.

=== Snohomish Tribe of Indians ===
Some Snohomish people are members of the Snohomish Tribe of Indians or Snohomish Indian Tribe, commonly referred to as the Snohomish Tribe. The Snohomish Tribe is an unrecognized heritage group which claims descent from five aboriginal peoples: the Snohomish, the Sdodohobsh, the N&#x27;Quentlmamish, the Skykomish, and the Sktalejum. It was incorporated in 1974, and has sought federal recognition and a reservation between Snohomish and Monroe. In 2004, they were denied federal recognition, and they appealed the decision in 2008. They hold an annual powwow on Marrowstone Island, near Port Townsend. There were approximately 1,200 members of the group in 2008, although it is unknown what percentage are Snohomish descent.

<text>In archaeology, a type site (American English) or type-site (British English) is the site used to define a particular archaeological culture or other typological unit, which is often named after it. For example, discoveries at La Tène and Hallstatt led scholars to divide the European Iron Age into the La Tène culture and Hallstatt culture, named after their respective type sites.

The concept is similar to type localities in geology and type specimens in biology.

<text>Santiago Bernabéu de Yeste (; 8 June 1895 – 2 June 1978) was a Spanish footballer who played for Real Madrid as a forward. He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of Real Madrid, having served as its president for 34 years and 264 days, from 11 September 1943 until his death on 2 June 1978.

Under Bernabéu&#x27;s leadership, Real Madrid became a dominant team both on national and international level, with its influence stretching beyond the football pitch. The club&#x27;s current stadium is named in his honour.

==Early years and career==
Bernabéu was born in Montealegre del Castillo (named simply Montealegre before 1916), in the province of Albacete, Spain. However, he was registered at his parents&#x27; home in the near town Almansa, where his family lived. His family moved to Madrid when he was very young, and Bernabéu himself joined the Real Madrid junior ranks in 1909 at age 14, after being a regular spectator at their matches for years. Bernabéu wore the captain&#x27;s armband for years. In 1920, Santiago Bernabéu withdrew from Real Madrid and went on to join their city rival Atlético Madrid, with whom he would only play one game. In 1921, he returned to Real Madrid, playing as a striker before retiring from playing in 1926. He continued to be associated with the club until 1935, first as manager of the first team, then as a director and later becoming assistant manager.

==Civil War==
With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, professional football ceased to be played in Spain. During the war, Bernabéu fought on the side of Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalists under the general Agustín Muñoz Grandes.

==Post-Civil War==
After the war, Bernabéu proceeded to spend the next several months finding and contacting former players, directors, and club members, eventually restructuring the club.
In 1943, Bernabéu was elected president of Real Madrid – a position he would occupy until his death on 2 June 1978, beginning to implant his ideas. He restructured the club at all levels, in what would become the normal operating structure of professional clubs in the future, giving every section and level of the club independent technical teams and recruiting people who were ambitious and visionary in their own right, such as Raimundo Saporta.

He then endeavoured to build what would become the stadium that today bears his name, at the time the largest stadium in all of Europe. The Ciudad Deportiva, built so that the players could train without damaging the stadium&#x27;s pitch, was also constructed during these years. Finally, he embarked upon an ambitious strategy of signing world-class players from Spain and abroad, the most prominent of them being the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. During Bernabéu&#x27;s presidency many of Real Madrid&#x27;s most legendary names played for the club, including Molowny, Muñoz, Di Stéfano, Gento, Rial, Santamaría, Kopa, Puskás, Amancio, Pirri, Netzer, Santillana, Juanito, Camacho, del Bosque, and many others. With this legendary team, Real Madrid would go on to usher in an unprecedented era of dominance both domestically and internationally, highlighted by its five consecutive European Cup triumphs and numerous domestic titles. 

==Influence in Europe and legacy==
In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by the &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; journalist Gabriel Hanot and building upon the Latin Cup (at the time the most important European club tournament involving the champions of France, Spain, Portugal, and Italy), Bernabéu met in the Ambassador Hotel in Paris with Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel) and Gustav Sebes and created what was at first a loosely constructed tournament played among invited teams, but which over time developed into what is today the Champions League. Under the administration of UEFA, it is the world&#x27;s premier club competition.

Bernabéu helped Manchester United rebuild its team following the Munich air disaster in 1958.

At the time of his death, Bernabéu had been the club&#x27;s president for nearly 35 years, during which his club won 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups, 1 Intercontinental Cup, 16 league titles, 6 Spanish Cups, and 1 Copa Eva Duarte. He died in 1978, while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. In his honour FIFA decreed three days of mourning during the tournament. In 2002, he was posthumously awarded the FIFA Order of Merit.

<text>Walter Francis Kerr (July 8, 1913 – October 9, 1996) was an American writer and Broadway theatre critic. He also was the writer, lyricist, and/or director of several Broadway plays and musicals as well as the author of several books, generally on the subject of theater and cinema.

==Biography==
Kerr was born in Evanston, Illinois, and earned both a B.A. and M.A. from Northwestern University., after graduation from St. George High School, also in Evanston.

He was a regular film critic for the St. George High School newspaper while a student there, and was also a critic for the Evanston &quot;News Index&quot;. He was the editor of the high school newspaper and yearbook. He taught speech and drama at The Catholic University of America. 

After writing criticism for &quot;Commonweal&quot; he became a theater critic for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; in 1951. When that paper folded, he then began writing theater reviews for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1966, writing for the next seventeen years. During this time, Kerr lived in New Rochelle, New York in the same house Norman Rockwell had lived in.

He married fellow writer Jean Kerr (née Collins) on August 9, 1943. Together, they wrote the musical &quot;Goldilocks&quot; (1958), which won two Tony Awards. They also collaborated on &quot;Touch and Go&quot; (1949) and &quot;King of Hearts&quot; (1954). They had six children.

Kerr died from congestive heart failure on October 9, 1996.

He was portrayed pseudonymously by David Niven in the 1960 film &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Eat the Daisies&quot;, based on Jean Kerr&#x27;s best-selling collection of humorous essays.

==Critiquing shows==

Kerr was one of the harshest New York theatre critics of his era, giving the fewest favorable reviews. He was well known for panning musicals that were musically ambitious.

Notoriously he is credited with one of the world&#x27;s shortest reviews, &quot;Me no Leica&quot; for John Van Druten&#x27;s &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, December 31, 1951.

===Stephen Sondheim===
Many of the shows he critiqued were those of Stephen Sondheim. About Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Company&quot;, Kerr wrote that it was too cold, cynical and distant for his taste, though he &quot;admitted to admiring large parts of the show.&quot;

About Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;, he wrote &quot; &#x27;Follies&#x27; is intermissionless and exhausting, an extravaganza that becomes tedious for two simple reasons: Its extravagances have nothing to do with its pebble of a plot; and the plot, which could be wrapped up in approximately two songs, dawdles through 22 before it declares itself done... Mr. Sondheim may be too much a man of the seventies, too present-tense sophisticated... The effort to bind it up inhibits the crackling, open-ended, restlessly varied surges of sound he devised with such distinction for &quot;Company&quot;.&quot;

He praised &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, writing that &quot;The score is a gift, the ladies are delightful, and producer Harold Prince has staged the moody meetings with easy skill.&quot;

He expressed mixed sentiments about &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, praising the music but deeming it too lilting for the show&#x27;s grisly subject; his conclusion- &quot;What is this musical about?&quot; He wrote a follow-up article on his observation that the musical contained a plot from Molière&#x27;s &quot;The School for Wives&quot;, posing the question who, of all of the authors who had revised the tale of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; over the years, had put the plot into the story.

Nevertheless, in 1977, he wrote of Sondheim &quot;I needn&#x27;t tell you that Stephen Sondheim is, both musically and lyrically, the most sophisticated composer now working for the Broadway theater.&quot;

===Leonard Bernstein===
In reviewing Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;West Side Story&quot; he focused on the dancing: &quot;the most savage, restless, electrifying dance patterns we&#x27;ve been exposed to in a dozen seasons... The dancing is it. Don&#x27;t look for laughter or—for that matter—tears.&quot;

In his review of the original 1956 Broadway production of &quot;Candide&quot;, he wrote that it was a &quot;really spectacular disaster&quot;. However, in reviewing the 1973 revival of &quot;Candide&quot; he wrote that it was a &quot;most satisfying resurrection. [...] &#x27;Candide&#x27; may at last have stumbled into the best of all possible productions... The show is now a carousel and we are on it quite safely... The design of the unending chase is so firm, the performers are so secure in their climbing and tumbling...that we are able to join the journey and still see it with the detachment that Voltaire prescribes.&quot;

===Frank Loesser===
Of Frank Loesser&#x27;s &quot;musical with a lot of music&quot; [sic. opera], &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot; he wrote: &quot;the evening at the Imperial is finally heavy with its own inventiveness, weighted down with the variety and fulsomeness of a genuinely creative appetite. It&#x27;s as though Mr. Loesser had written two complete musicals—the operetta and the haymaker—on the same simple play and then crammed them both into a single structure.&quot;

===Other criticism===

Kerr was also notable for his lack of enthusiasm for the plays of Samuel Beckett. For instance, of Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting For Godot&quot; he wrote &quot;The play, asking for a thousand readings, has none of its own to give. It is a veil rather than a revelation. It wears a mask rather than a face.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
Walter Kerr won a Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1978 for &quot;articles on the theater&quot;.

In 1983, Kerr was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

In 1990, the former Ritz Theater on West 48th Street in the Theater District, New York was renamed the Walter Kerr Theatre in his honor.

<doc id="1257708" wikidata="Q377971" url="?curid=1257708" title="José Cardozo">
<text>José Saturnino Cardozo Otazú (; born 19 March 1971) is a Paraguayan football manager and former footballer. He played as a striker and spent 10 years of his career playing for Toluca and is the club&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer. He also managed Toluca in 2013 up to 2016.

Cardozo earned 82 caps for Paraguay between 1991 and 2006, putting him ninth in their most-capped players of all time, with his haul of 25 international goals the second most for the nation. He represented them at three Copa América tournaments, two FIFA World Cups, and the 2004 Olympic tournament, winning silver in the latter.

Cardozo, while on loan for the tournament, was also a main catalyst and goalscorer for runner-up Cruz Azul in the 2001 Copa Libertadores defeat to Buenos Aires club Boca Jr.

In the 2002/03 season, José Saturnino Cardozo was recognized as the World Top Scorer in the First Division according to the IFFHS. He scored 58 goals between the Apertura 2002 and Clausura 2003 playing for Deportivo Toluca F.C.

==Club career==
Born in Nueva Italia in the Central Department, Cardozo began his professional career in 1988, making his debut for River Plate of Paraguay. After four years in River, he moved to Swiss club FC St. Gallen, where he played from 1990 to 1992. He returned to South America in 1993, joining Universidad Católica de Chile helping the team reach the 1993 Copa Libertadores de América final. The following year he played for Club Olimpia of Paraguay, from which he moved to Club Toluca of Mexico.

Cardozo made his debut for Toluca in the 1995 season, but only appeared in three games, scoring no goals. However, in the subsequent winter season, he scored 7 goals in 13 games. In his ten years with the team, he has scored a record 249 goals for the club, including 36 goals in 25 matches in the 2002 Apertura. Cardozo was top scorer of the league four times (Verano 1998, Verano 1999, Apertura 2002, and Clausura 2003). He moved to the 4th spot in the list of all-time top scorers in the Mexico Primera Division after Jared Borgetti scored his 250th goal with Monarcas Morelia.

Due to his work at Toluca, Cardozo was elected as the Paraguayan Footballer of the Year in the years 2000, 2002 and 2003; and the South American Footballer of the Year in 2002. Despite the fact that he was fiercely opposed to the move, Cardozo was transferred to Argentine team San Lorenzo de Almagro in June 2005, and finished the season with only 4 goals due to injuries that kept him away from playing several games. However, many critics lambasted Cardozo for refusing to play through the pain. While playing for Toluca, Cardozo struggled through the 1997 campaign with hamstring problems and then played through much of the 2001 season despite suffering a broken wrist in the season opener. Cardozo is the all-time leading scorer for Toluca, with 249 goals in 332 appearances.

In July 2006, Cardozo attempted to return to Club Olimpia to finish his career. He was unable to re-sign for the club because the Paraguayan league&#x27;s transfer deadline had already passed. As a result of his inability to sign for Olimpia, he decided to retire from football. He scored 342 goals total in his career. In June 2008 a match was organized in the city of Toluca to honor his career and contributions to football. Cardozo scored two goals in the match which had a sellout crowd.

==Paraguay national team==
Cardozo was the all-time leading scorer for the Paraguay national team, with 25 goals, until 2013, with the record being broken by Roque Santa Cruz. He played for his country at the 1998 and 2002 World Cups and was named in the original 2006 World Cup squad but he was injured during training sessions and replaced by Dante López. Cardozo was also an over-age player at the 2004 Summer Olympics, when Paraguay finished second. On 4 August, before the Summer Olympics began, he played in a preparation game against the Portugal of Cristiano Ronaldo in the city of Algarve, resulting in a 5–0 defeat. He scored a hat-trick against Uruguay in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification, with the final result being 4–1.

==Coaching career==
===Club Olimpia===
In November 2006, Club Olimpia&#x27;s coach Oscar Paulin was fired due to poor performances by the team and Cardozo was named as the interim coach of the Paraguayan club, this being his first experience as a coach. He coached for the remainder of the year and for the 2007 Apertura tournament.

===Indios===
In October 2009 he was hired to be an assistant coach for the team of Indios de Juarez for the Apertura 2009.

====Club Olimpia (Return)====
Cardozo returned to Olimpia Asunción in November 2009 following coach Carlos Kiese&#x27;s resignation.

===Querétaro FC===
In 2011, he was hired as coach Querétaro FC where he led the team into their first liguilla and the team&#x27;s all team highest place (8th) and points (26) in Primera División regular season. He managed to eliminate Guadalajara in the Quarter Finals and advance to a surprising semi-final where they lost to champions Tigres UANL 1–0. The following season however, Querétaro began the season with poor results, which once again emerged relegation problems against rivals Atlas and Estudiantes Tecos (relegated) which led to Cardozo&#x27;s resignation.

====Club Olimpia (Return)====
After spending the 2011 and 2012 seasons at Querétaro, he was appointed to manage Olimpia once again on 25 September 2012 after the departure of Gregorio Perez.

===Toluca===
On 7 May 2013, Cardozo was announced as the new manager for Club Deportivo Toluca of Mexico where he played for 10 years (1995–2005). On 1 May 2016, during the 2016 Clausura, Cardozo confirmed that he would no longer coach Toluca beyond the end of the season despite still having a year left on his contract. He stated that since he did not meet his objective of reaching the Liga MX playoffs with the club, he had nothing more to do with the club, citing that Toluca was a big club with directors and fans that expected a lot more of the team than he could continue to offer. He stated that when a team can no longer accomplish what is asked of it, that the first change that must come is the manager, no questions about it.

===Chiapas===
Cardozo had a turbulent season at Chiapas during the Apertura 2016, being sacked in September and then brought back due to the petition of the chiapas players. He was ultimately sacked one week later after two more defeats.

===Puebla===
Cardozo took over Club Puebla early in the Clausura 2017 season.

===Guadalajara===
On 12 June 2018, Cardozo was appointed manager of Liga MX club Guadalajara.

<text>Material culture is the aspect of culture manifested by the physical objects and architecture of a society. The term is primarily used in archaeology and anthropology, but is also of interest to sociology, geography and history. The field considers artifacts in relation to their specific cultural and historic contexts, communities and belief systems. It includes the usage, consumption, creation and trade of objects as well as the behaviors, norms and rituals that the objects create or take part in.

Material culture is contrasted with symbolic culture or non-material culture, which include non-material symbols, beliefs and social constructs. However, some scholars include in material culture other intangible phenomena like sound, smell and events, while some even consider it to include language and media. Material culture can be described as any object that humans use to survive, define social relationships, represent facets of identity, or benefit peoples&#x27; state of mind, social, or economic standing.

The scholarly analysis of material culture, which can include both human made and natural or altered objects, is called material culture studies. It is an interdisciplinary field and methodology that tells of the relationships between people and their things: the making, history, preservation and interpretation of objects. It draws on both theory and practice from the social sciences and humanities such as art history, archaeology, anthropology, history, historic preservation, folklore, archival science, literary criticism and museum studies.

== Material value ==
Research in several areas looks into the reasons for perceiving an object as having meaning. Common reasons for valuing material lie in their monetary or sentimental value.

A well-known related theory is Daniel Kahneman&#x27;s endowment effect theory. According to Kahneman, people infuse objects they own with a higher value than they do if they do not own the object. The endowment effect is found to occur as soon as an item is acquired and the effect increases over time.

Another way in which material can hold meaning and value is by carrying communication between people, just like other communication forms such as speech, touch and gesture. An object can mediate messages between time or space or both between people who are not together. A work of art, for example, can transfer a message from the creator to the viewer and share an image, a feeling, or an experience. Material can contain memories and mutual experiences across time and influence thoughts and feelings. A study found that couples who have more items that were jointly acquired and more favorite items among them had higher-quality relationships.

Researchers from the fields of sociology, psychology, and anthropology have also been fascinated by gift-giving, a universal phenomenon that holds emotional meaning using material culture. According to Schieffelin, &quot;gift-giving is a vehicle of social obligation and political maneuver.&quot; Mauss defines the gift as creating a special bond between the giver and the receiver. According to Mauss, the giver never really leaves the gift but becomes part of the receiver&#x27;s future by inserting the gift into their life. A gift leads at some point to another gift in response, which creates a special reciprocal bond between people.

==History==

Material culture studies as an academic field grew along the field of anthropology and so began by studying non-Western material culture. All too often, it was a way of putting material culture into categories in such a way that marginalized and hierarchized the cultures from which they came. During the &quot;golden age&quot; of museum-going, material cultures were used to show the supposed evolution of society from the simple objects of non-Westerners to the advanced objects of Europeans. It was a way of showing that Europeans were at the end of the evolution of society, with non-Westerners at the beginning. Eventually, scholars left the notion that culture evolved though predictable cycles, and the study of material culture changed to have a more objective view of non-Western material culture.

The field of material culture studies as its own distinct discipline dates to the 1990s. The &quot;Journal of Material Culture&quot; began publishing in 1996. Collecting habits date back hundreds of years.

==Contributors==
Leslie White was an American anthropologist, known for his advocacy of theories of cultural evolution, sociocultural evolution, and especially neoevolutionism and for his role in creating the department of anthropology at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. He was president of the American Anthropological Association (1964). He wrote &quot;The Science of Culture&quot; in 1949 in which he outlined schema of the world as divided into cultural, biological, and physical levels of phenomenon. White believed that the development of culture rested primarily on technology and that the history of human technology could be understood through the study of human-produced materials.

American anthropologist James Deetz, known for his work in the field of historical archaeology, wrote the book &quot;In Small Things Forgotten&quot; in 1977 and published a revised and expanded version in 1996. He pioneered there the ideas of using neglected substances such as trash pits, potshards, and soil stains to reveal human actions. By analyzing objects in association with their location, the history of that location, the objects they were found with, and not singling out the most valuable or rarest ones, archaeologists can create a more accurate picture of daily life. Deetz looks at the long view of history and investigates the impact of European culture on other cultures across the globe by an analysis of the spread of everyday objects.

Ian M. G. Quimby&#x27;s &quot;Material Culture and the Study of American Life&quot;, written in 1978, tried to bridge the gaps between the museum world and the university and between curator and historian. Quimby posits that objects in museums are understood through an intellectual framework that uses non-traditional sources. He also describes the benefits of work on exhibit design as a vehicle for education.

Thomas Schlereth, Professor Emeritus of American Studies at the University of Notre Dame, wrote about philosophies and methods of teaching history outside the traditional classroom. In his book &quot;Artifacts and the American Past&quot;, Schlereth defines material culture study as an attempt to explain why things were made, why they took the forms they did, and what social, functional, aesthetic, or symbolic needs they serve. He advocates studying photographs, catalogues, maps and landscapes. He suggests a variety of modes for interrogating artifacts.

Professor Kiki Smith of Smith College, asserts that &quot;…clothes can reveal much about lives from the past&quot;, and that garments preserved in collections are akin to other artifacts, including books, diaries, paintings and letters. She established the Smith College Historic Clothing Collection with 3000 items for the college&#x27;s theater department. This archive of women&#x27;s clothing and accessories, from all social classes, is a resource for courses in costume design, history, material culture, and literary history and curatorial practices.

Gerd Koch, associated with the Ethnological Museum of Berlin, is known for his studies on the material culture of Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Santa Cruz Islands. During his early field work in 1951 to 1952, Koch developed techniques in the recording of culture, including the use of tape recorders and cinematographic cameras.

==Archaeology==

Archaeology is the study of humanity through the inferential analysis of material culture to ultimately gain an understanding of the daily lives of past cultures and the overarching trend of human history. An archaeological culture is a recurring assemblage of the artifacts from a specific time and place, most often that has no written record. These physical artifacts are then used to make inferences about the ephemeral aspects of culture and history. With more recent societies, written histories, oral traditions, and direct observations may also be available to supplement the study of material culture.

Beginning in the European Renaissance and the culture&#x27;s fascination with classical antiquities, the study of artifacts from long-lost cultures has produced many forms of archaeological theory, such as trans-cultural diffusion, processual archaeology, and post-processual archaeology. Additionally, archaeological sub-disciplines have emerged within the field, including prehistoric archaeology, classical archaeology, historical archaeology, cognitive archaeology, and cultural ecology. Recently, a scientific methodology and approach to the analysis of pre-historic material culture has become prevalent with systematic excavation techniques producing detailed and precise results.

==Anthropology==

Anthropology is most simply defined as the study of humans across time and space. In studying a human culture, an anthropologist studies the material culture of the people in question as well as the people themselves and their interactions with others. To understand the culture in which an object is featured, an anthropologist looks at the object itself, its context, and the way that it was manufactured and used.

The first anthropologist interested in studying material culture was Lewis Henry Morgan, in the mid-19th century. He is most known for his research on kinship and social structures, but he also studied the effect of material culture, specifically technology, on the evolution of a society. Later in the 19th century, Franz Boas brought the fields of anthropology and material culture studies closer together. He believed that it was crucial for an anthropologist to analyze not only the physical properties of material culture but also its meanings and uses in its indigenous context to begin to understand a society. At the same time in France, Émile Durkheim wrote about the importance of material culture in understanding a society. Durkheim saw material culture as one of the social facts that functions as a coercive force to maintain solidarity in a society.

Claude Lévi-Strauss, in the 20th century, included the study of material culture in his work as an anthropologist because he believed that it could reveal a deeper level of structure and meaning unattainable by typical fieldwork. According to Lévi-Strauss, material culture can recall the mindset of a people, regardless of intervening time or space. Also in the 20th century, Mary Douglas thought that anthropology was about studying the meaning of material culture to the people who experience it. Marvin Harris, a contemporary of Douglas, put forward the theory of cultural materialism and said that all aspects of society have material causes.

==Sociology==

In archaeology, the idea that social relations are embodied in material is well known and established, with extensive research on exchange, gift giving and objects as part of social ceremonies and events. However, in contradiction to archaeology, where scientists build on material remains of previous cultures, sociology tends to overlook the importance of material in understanding relationships and human social behavior.

The social aspects in material culture include the social behavior around it: the way that the material is used, shared, talked about, or made. An object cannot hold meaning in and of itself and so when one focuses on the social aspects of material culture, it is critical to keep in mind that interpretations of objects and of interactions with them are the ones to evoke importance and meaning.

==Heritage industry==
Museums and other material culture repositories, by their very nature, are often active participants in the heritage industry. Defined as &quot;the business of managing places that are important to an area&#x27;s history and encouraging people to visit them,&quot; the heritage industry relies heavily on material culture and objects to interpret cultural heritage. The industry is fueled by a cycle of people visiting museums, historic sites, and collections to interact with ideas or physical objects of the past. In turn, the institutions profit through monetary donations or admission fees as well as the publicity that comes with word-of-mouth communications.

That relationship is controversial, as many believe that the heritage industry corrupts the meaning and importance of cultural objects. Often, scholars in the humanities take a critical view of the heritage industry, particularly heritage tourism, believing it to be a vulgar oversimplification and corruption of historic fact and importance. Others believe that the relationship and the financial stability it brings is often the element that allows curators, researchers, and directors to conserve material culture&#x27;s legacy.

<text>Strickland is an English toponymic surname derived from the manor of Strickland in the historical county of Westmorland, now Cumbria, England, represented geographically by the modern villages of Great Strickland and Little Strickland. The surname dates as far back as the 12th century in Westmorland, and is also found at an early date in the Scottish counties of Ayrshire and Lanarkshire.

== Etymology ==
The surname Strickland (early forms include Stirkeland) is derived from the place-name Stercaland, given to a manor in the former county of Westmorland near Penrith, Cumbria. The place-name is Old English, from &quot;stirc&quot;, &quot;styr(i}c&quot; or &quot;steorc&quot; bullock, and &quot;land&quot;, a piece of land or pasture.

== History ==
The earliest known Strickland was a late-12th century landholder named Walter of Castlecarrock, who married Christian of Letheringham, an heiress to the landed estate that covered the area where the villages of Great Strickland and Little Strickland are now. After this marriage Walter became known as Walter de Strickland, spelt in various ways.

When Sir William de Stirkeland (1242–1305) married Elizabeth Deincourt (or d&#x27;Eyncourt), Sizergh Castle became the seat of this Strickland gentry family. A descendant, Thomas Strykeland is said to have carried the banner of St. George at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. They also had a family chapel in the Kendal Parish Church (Holy Trinity), and both Kendal and Penrith have main roads called Stricklandgate (The &#x27;gate&#x27; element is from Old Norse &quot;gata&quot;, street). Other local landmarks include Strickland Wood, Warton near Carnforth.

They also gave their name to one of their properties, a settlement that first appeared on the west side of present-day Kendal with a motte-and-bailey fortification on it that became known as &quot;Kirkbie Strickland&quot; (Kirkbie is from Old Norse &quot;Kirkju&quot;, church, and &quot;by&quot;, village.).

A Strickland gentry family seated at Gilsland was granted a coat of arms blazoned: &quot;Sable, three escallops argent&quot;, meaning &quot;three white scallops on a black field&quot;.

<doc id="1257741" wikidata="Q1154120" url="?curid=1257741" title="Kruger 60">
<text>Krüger 60 (DO Cephei) is a binary star system located from Earth, being one of nearest stars. It is made up of a pair of red dwarfs stars orbiting each other every 45 years.

==Description==
The larger, primary star is designated component A, while the secondary, smaller star is labeled component B. Component A has about 27% of the Sun&#x27;s mass and 30% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. Component B has about 18% of the Sun&#x27;s mass and 22% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. 
In 1951, Peter van de Kamp and Sarah Lee Lippincott announced that component B is a flare star. It was given the variable star designation &quot;DO Cephei&quot;. Flares lasting as long as one hour have been recorded.

This system is orbiting through the Milky Way at a distance from the core that varies from 7–9 kpc with an orbital eccentricity of 0.126–0.130. The closest approach to the Sun will occur in about 88,600 years when this system will come within .

Considering the orbit of the members of Krüger 60, detecting an exoplanet through radial velocity could prove difficult, as its orbit would be inclined only 13 degrees from our point of view, and create 1/5th as strong a radial velocity signal as an exoplanet orbiting edge-on from the point of view of the Solar System.

==Origin of 2I/Borisov ==

Krüger 60 was proposed as the origin of interstellar comet 2I/Borisov (formerly named C/2019 Q4 (Borisov)) in a preprint submitted to arXiv by Dybczyński, Królikowska, and Wysoczańska. These authors had from other work a list of stars and stellar systems that can potentially act as perturbers of the Oort cloud comets, and searched it for a past close proximity of 2I/Borisov at a very small relative velocity. While hampered by uncertainty about the orbit of 2I/Borisov and particularly its non-gravitational acceleration (due to cometary outgassing), they initially reached a conclusion that 1 Myr ago 2I/Borisov passed Krüger 60 at a small distance of 1.74 pc while having an extremely small relative velocity of 3.43 km/s. Perturbations of 2I/Borisov&#x27;s incoming orbit altered the intersection distance with relatively small changes in the relative velocity. However, further study by the same authors presented in the revised version of the preprint instead ruled out the possibility of Krüger 60 as a home system for 2I/Borisov.

<text>Carolyn Davidson (born 1943) is an American graphic designer best known for designing the Nike Swoosh logo.

== Early and current life ==
Little is known about Davidson, who retired in 2000 and has not been found on public social media sites. She was last reported as spending her time quietly out of the spotlight, working on her personal interests after her fame and success relating to the Nike logo. 

==Career==
Davidson designed the Swoosh in 1971 while a graphic design student at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. She started as a journalism major but switched to design after taking a design course to &quot;fill an empty elective.&quot; She attained a bachelor&#x27;s in graphic design in 1971. Phil Knight, who was teaching an accounting class at the university, overheard Davidson say that she couldn&#x27;t afford oil painting supplies and asked her to do some work for what was then Blue Ribbon Sports, Inc. (later Nike). Knight offered Davidson a job in creating charts and graphs for his meetings with Japanese footwear executives. Her success with this work led to Davidson designing posters, ads, and flyers for the company. In 1971, Knight and his co-founder needed a logo for a new line of running shoes they were getting ready to introduce. They asked Davidson to design a stripe (industry term for a shoe logo) that &quot;had something to do with movement&quot;.

Davidson worked on her ideas by drawing on a piece of tissue over a drawing of a shoe. She gave him five different designs, one of which was the Swoosh which resembles a wing and hints at Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. 

Needing to choose a logo in order to meet looming production deadlines, Knight settled on the Swoosh after rejecting four other designs by Davidson. At the time, he stated of the logo, &quot;I don&#x27;t love it, but it will grow on me.&quot; For her services, the company paid her $35, . Davidson continued working for Blue Ribbon Sports (it officially became Nike, Inc. in 1972) until the design demands of the growing company exceeded one person&#x27;s capacity. In 1976, the company hired its first external advertising agency, John Brown and Partners, and Davidson went on to work on other clients&#x27; needs.

In September 1983, nearly three years after the company went public, Knight invited Davidson to a company reception. There, he presented her with chocolate swooshes, a diamond ring made of gold and engraved with the Swoosh, and an envelope filled with 500 shares of Nike stock, then worth about seventeen cents per share or $85, worth in 2023—after stock splits bringing the total to 32,000 shares—about $3 million. Of the gift, Davidson says, &quot;this was something rather special for Phil to do, because I originally billed him and he paid that invoice.&quot; Davidson went on to be known as &quot;The Logo Lady&quot;. In 1995, Nike removed the word &quot;Nike&quot; from the logo; the Swoosh now stands alone as the brand&#x27;s logo.

Davidson retired in 2000, and now engages in hobbies and volunteer work, including weekly duties at the Ronald McDonald House at Legacy Emanuel Hospital &amp; Health Center in Oregon.

<text>The Elementary School () is a 1991 Czechoslovak comedy-drama film directed by Jan Svěrák. The screenplay comes from the pen of his father Zdeněk Svěrák. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1991 and is considered to belong among the best Czechoslovak films ever. A prequel, &quot;Barefoot&quot;, was released in 2017.

The film is set in the early post-war period, in a suburban elementary school in Prague&#x27;s vicinity. A war hero is hired as a teacher, and asked to discipline an unruly class of boys. He soon earns their respect, but he is threatened with termination over his reputed sexual relationship with two highschool girls.

==Plot==
Shortly after World War II, in 1945–46, in one of the suburbs of Prague (the film was shot in Michle), Eda Souček attends a boys&#x27; elementary school where he belongs to a class with a complete lack of discipline. After the class drives their teacher, Maxová, to a mental breakdown during one of her classes, the schoolmaster has to implement special measures. Authoritative Igor Hnízdo, who is said to be a great war hero, is hired as their new teacher. He immediately introduces corporal punishment, which, as he claims, is not normally allowed, but the school has received an exception from the Ministry of Education, especially for their class. Whenever he is not satisfied with the boys&#x27; behavior, Hnízdo asks them to flex their arms and hits their palms several times with a flexible switch.

Despite his strict methods, the boys soon become charmed by the man. They love his battlefront stories and the fact that he is always armed and wears a uniform. Eda sees him as the very opposite of his own father, whom he considers to be too cowardly. Hnízdo makes the same positive impression on the townspeople (including Eda&#x27;s mother). Nevertheless, his persona is also surrounded by many controversies. He is a notorious womanizer and is said to have a special weakness for high school girls. His war heroism is also disputed as he is unable to provide any accurate information about his military service. There is even an unconfirmed rumor that Hnízdo&#x27;s role during the war was to guard a herd of goats. But the boys from his class refuse to believe it and even fight those who are spreading these rumors.

Hnízdo&#x27;s reputation suffers after he is accused of having a sexual relationship with 16-year-old twins who attend a girls&#x27; school in the same area. He is forced to leave because this is not the first time he has been involved in a similar scandal. The formerly unmanageable boys begin to defend Hnízdo and call for his return. The accusation is finally withdrawn, and Hnízdo is reinstalled as their teacher. He states that the way they dealt with the accusation is proof that their relationship is now based on mutual trust and physical punishments are no longer required, and he breaks his switch in half.

==Cast==
* Václav Jakoubek as Eda Souček
* Jan Tříska as Igor Hnízdo
* Radoslav Budáč as Tonda
* Zdeněk Svěrák as František Souček
* Libuše Šafránková as Mrs. Součková
* Rudolf Hrušínský as Schoolmaster

==Production==
The original story was written by Zdeněk Svěrák. He used his own experiences both as a pupil of a similar school and as a former teacher. This is the first of the films created by the successful father screenwriter - son director duo. The others include &quot;Akumulátor I.&quot; (1993), &quot;Kolja&quot; (1996), &quot;Tmavomodrý svět&quot; (2000) and &quot;Vratné lahve&quot; (2007). It was also the first non-documentary film by Jan Svěrák. Obecná škola is also notable because it includes one of the last roles for two prominent Czech actors Rudolf Hrušínský (his last big screen film) and Petr Čepek (appeared in two more films before his death). The film was also the first appearance of Jan Tříska in a Czech film since his emigration to the United States in 1977.

<doc id="1257746" wikidata="Q252554" url="?curid=1257746" title="Wesley A. Clark">
<text>Wesley Allison Clark (April 10, 1927 – February 22, 2016) was an American physicist who is credited for designing the first modern personal computer. He was also a computer designer and the main participant, along with Charles Molnar, in the creation of the LINC computer, which was the first minicomputer and shares with a number of other computers (such as the PDP-1) the claim to be the inspiration for the personal computer.

Clark was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and grew up in Kinderhook, New York, and in northern California. His parents, Wesley Sr. and Eleanor Kittell, moved to California, and he attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he graduated with a degree in physics in 1947. Clark began his career as a physicist at the Hanford Site.
In 1981, Clark received the Eckert–Mauchly Award for his work on computer architecture. He was awarded an honorary degree by Washington University in St. Louis in 1984. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1999. Clark is a charter recipient of the IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award for &quot;First Personal Computer&quot;.

==At Lincoln Laboratory==
Clark moved to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 1952 where he joined the Project Whirlwind staff. There he was involved in the development of the Memory Test Computer (MTC), a testbed for ferrite core memory that was to be used in Whirlwind. His sessions with the MTC, &quot;lasting hours rather than minutes&quot; helped form his views that computers were to be used as tools on demand for those who needed them. That view carried over into his designs for the TX-0 and TX-2 and the LINC. He expresses this view clearly here:

...both of the Cambridge machines, Whirlwind and MTC, had been completely committed to the air defense effort and were no longer available for general use. The only surviving computing system paradigm seen by M.I.T. students and faculty was that of a very large International Business Machine in a tightly sealed Computation Center: the computer not as tool, but as demigod. Although we were not happy about giving up the TX-0, it was clear that making this small part of Lincoln&#x27;s advanced technology available to a larger M.I.T. community would be an important corrective step.

Clark is

one of the fathers of the personal computer... he was the architect of both the TX-0 and TX-2 at Lincoln Labs. He believed that &quot;a computer should be just another piece of lab equipment.&quot; At a time when most computers were huge remote machines operated in batch mode, he advocated far more interactive access. He practiced what he preached, even though it often meant bucking current &quot;wisdom&quot; and authority (in a 1981 lecture, he mentioned that he had the distinction of being, &quot;the only person to have been fired three times from MIT for insubordination&quot;.)

Clark&#x27;s design for the TX-2 &quot;integrated a number of man-machine interfaces that were just waiting for the right person to show up to use them in order to make a computer that was &#x27;on-line&#x27;. When selecting a PhD thesis topic, an MIT student named Ivan Sutherland looked at the simple cathode ray tube and light pen on the TX-2&#x27;s console and thought one should be able to draw on the computer. Thus was born Sketchpad, and with it, interactive computer graphics.&quot;

==At Washington University==

In 1964, Clark moved to Washington University in St. Louis where he and Charles Molnar worked on macromodules, which were the fundamental building blocks in the world of asynchronous computing. The goal of the macromodules was to provide a set of basic building blocks that would allow computer users to build and extend their computers without requiring any knowledge of electrical engineering.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; series on the history of the personal computer had this to say in an article on August 19, 2001, &quot;How the Computer Became Personal&quot;:

In the pantheon of personal computing, the LINC, in a sense, came first—more than a decade before Ed Roberts made PC&#x27;s affordable for ordinary people. Work started on the Linc, the brainchild of the M.I.T. physicist Wesley A. Clark, in May 1961, and the machine was used for the first time at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, MD, the next year to analyze a cat&#x27;s neural responses. 

Each Linc had a tiny screen and keyboard and comprised four metal modules, which together were about as big as two television sets, set side by side and tilted back slightly. The machine, a 12-bit computer, included a one-half megahertz processor. Lincs sold for about $43,000—a bargain at the time—and were ultimately made commercially by Digital Equipment, the first minicomputer company. Fifty Lincs of the original design were built. 

==Role in ARPANET==
Clark had a key insight in the planning for the ARPANET (the predecessor to the Internet). In April 1967, he suggested to Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts the idea of using separate small computers (later named Interface Message Processors) as a way of forming a message switching network and reducing load on the local computers. The same idea had earlier been independently developed by Donald Davies for the NPL network. The concept of packet switching was introduced to the ARPANET later, after the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967.

==Post-Nixon China trip==
In 1972, shortly after President Nixon&#x27;s trip to China, Clark accompanied five other computer scientists to China for three weeks to &quot;tour computer facilities and to discuss computer technology with Chinese experts in Shanghai and Beijing. Officially, the trip was seen by the Chinese in two lights: as a step in reestablishing the long-interrupted friendship between the two nations and as a step in opening channels for technical dialogue.&quot; The trip was organized by his colleague Severo Ornstein from MIT Lincoln Laboratory and Washington University. The other members of the group were: Thomas E. Cheatham, Anatol Holt, Alan J. Perlis and Herbert A. Simon.

==Death==
He was 88 when he died on February 22, 2016, at his home in Brooklyn due to severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

<text>Henry Robert Dugdale Hardy (born 15 March 1949) is a British academic, author and editor.

== Career ==

Hardy was born in London in 1949 and educated at Lancing College, where his contemporaries included Christopher Hampton and Tim Rice. He went on to study classics, and then philosophy and psychology, at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and philosophy at Wolfson College, Oxford, where he wrote a BPhil thesis in the philosophy of mind entitled &#x27;Subjective Experiences&#x27;, later expanded into a doctoral thesis entitled &#x27;Subjective Experience&#x27;. It was at Wolfson that Hardy met Wolfson&#x27;s then President, Isaiah Berlin.

Hardy&#x27;s first edited volume was a collection of writings by Arnold Mallinson, an eccentric Oxford clergyman with whom he lodged for seven years. He published this work under his own imprint (Robert Dugdale). While still a student, Hardy also composed a number of musical pieces, which he published many years later as &quot;Tunes: Collected Musical Juvenilia&quot; (2003).

In addition to publishing under the pseudonym Robert Dugdale from 1974 to 2005, Hardy worked for thirteen years (1977–90) as an editor at Oxford University Press, first editing and commissioning in the General Books Department, then commissioning academic books as Senior Editor, Political and Social Studies. At OUP in 1980, inspired by Isaiah Berlin&#x27;s insistence on the crucial role of individual thinkers in the history of ideas, he founded the Past Masters series (now absorbed into the Very Short Introductions series). His wish to publish a work of popular philosophy, &quot;Making Names&quot;, by Andrew Malcolm, was not endorsed by OUP. This was the subject of Malcolm&#x27;s landmark legal action against OUP for breach of contract. Hardy&#x27;s account of this episode is told in his review of Malcolm&#x27;s book about the case. Hardy has been a Fellow of Wolfson College since 1990 (an Honorary Fellow since 2015).

At Wolfson he met Bryan Magee, came to know him well, and became his executor. When Magee died in 2019, he organised a celebration of his life at Keble College, Oxford (where Magee was an undergraduate), which was recorded on film. A shortened version of the film may be viewed online.

== Isaiah Berlin ==
Isaiah Berlin, though a towering intellectual figure at the time of his death, was at one stage not regarded as having published very extensively. Hardy&#x27;s research revealed that Berlin had published well over 150 pieces by the late 1970s. By 2023 Hardy&#x27;s online list of Berlin&#x27;s publications had grown to almost 500 items.

Hardy&#x27;s editing of Berlin&#x27;s essays made Berlin&#x27;s most important work widely available. In 1990 Hardy abandoned his career in publishing to work full-time on Berlin&#x27;s unpublished essays, lectures, and correspondence. He has (co-)edited eighteen volumes of Berlin&#x27;s writings (plus new editions of thirteen of these volumes), as well as a four-volume edition of Berlin&#x27;s letters, and two books and a pamphlet about Berlin. In 2018 he published a memoir of his work with and on Berlin. Reviewing the book for &#x27;Best Books of 2018&#x27; in the &quot;Guardian&quot;, John Banville wrote: &#x27;Henry Hardy has self-effacingly devoted the larger part of his professional career to the editing, promoting and celebrating of the work of Isaiah Berlin. &quot;In Search of Isaiah Berlin: A Literary Adventure&quot; (I.B.Tauris) looks back over his long labours of love with fondness, a fine dry wit and a light salting of justified irritation at those entrusted with Berlin’s posthumous affairs. The second part consists of Hardy’s own philosophical response to Berlin’s theories on matters such as plurality, religious belief and our shared human nature. A wonderful book on a wonderful subject.&#x27;

In June 2015 Hardy delivered the 7th Isaiah Berlin Memorial Lecture in Riga. Opening remarks were made by Ivars Ijabs, chair of the Board of the Foundation for an Open Society.

== Maurice Bowra ==
Maurice Bowra was an English Classicist who was Warden of Wadham College, Oxford from 1938 to 1970. Known for his wit, he was also known for his &#x27;notoriously scabrous satirical poems on his contemporaries&#x27;, described as &#x27;unprintable&#x27; by John Sparrow, his friend from All Souls. &#x27;And unprinted [they have] largely remained, though Bowra did give occasional after-dinner readings to carefully chosen friends.&#x27;

This situation changed when Henry Hardy found a cache of Bowra&#x27;s poems as he was working through the papers of Isaiah Berlin. These had been saved by Berlin for a project started with John Sparrow to explain the many allusions the poems contain. Hardy, working with Jennifer Holmes, set about completing this project, adding poems from other sources, including Wadham College&#x27;s Bowra papers. The result was &quot;New Bats in Old Belfries&quot;, published in 2005, 34 years after Bowra&#x27;s death in 1971. Bowra&#x27;s title duplicates that of one of John Betjeman’s collections of poems (1945). (Betjeman was one of the contemporaries satirised by Bowra in his poems.)

Hardy was unable to include all of Bowra’s poems in 2005: two, written in 1950, remained unprintable: &#x27;This was because their subject was still alive, and was unwilling to give his approval for their inclusion in his lifetime.&#x27; The subject in question was the travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, and he remained adamant. Hardy relates how James Morwood (Emeritus Fellow of Wadham, and editor of the &quot;Wadham Gazette&quot;) &#x27;visited him later in his Greek home to ask about his friendship with Bowra (on behalf of Leslie Mitchell, Bowra’s biographer), he found that the hurt of reading the poems was still smarting.&#x27;

Fermor died in June 2011, and Hardy and Morwood published the two offending poems in the &quot;Wadham Gazette&quot; in December that year. The two poems were &quot;The Wounded Gigolo&quot; and &quot;On the Coast of Terra Fermoor&quot;.

== Family and personal life==
In 1979 Hardy married the historian of medicine Anne Wilkinson. They separated in 2004, and divorced in 2012. They have two children, Ellen (b. 1983) and Michael (b. 1985). Hardy married Mary Merry in 2013, and now lives with her in Wirral.

On 16 March 2021, Hardy suffered a cardiac arrest, which would probably have killed him had he not been taken to hospital shortly beforehand after a series of blackouts.

<text>Isabelle Aubret(; born Thérèse Coquerelle; 27 July 1938) is a French singer best known for winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 1962 with the song &quot;Un premier amour&quot;.

==Early life==
Thérèse Coquerelle was born in Lille, France, on 27 July 1938. She was the fifth of eleven children; her father was a foreman in a spinning mill, while her mother, of Ukrainian origin, was a housewife. Coquerelle trained in gymnastics as a child, and in 1952 she won the national French Gymnastics Championship. That same year, she left school and was hired as a winder in the Lemaire-Destombes factory in Saint-André, where her father worked. 

A few years later, she returned to this spinning mill to sing in the theatre of her family house, as part of a radio program. She continued to take drama and classical dance classes. At the same time, she participated in local singing competitions. Her drama teacher introduced her to the director of a Lille radio station, and Coquerelle took the stage for the first time. She sang in ensembles, and in 1956, at the age of eighteen, she joined an orchestra in Le Havre. In 1960 she won a singing competition at the Olympia, where she was noticed by the director of the room, Bruno Coquatrix. After Coquerelle secured a cabaret spot in Pigalle, she released her debut single &quot;Nous les Amoureux&quot; in 1961 under the name Isabelle Aubret.

== Career ==

Aubret won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1962, representing France and singing &quot;Un premier amour&quot; (&quot;A first love&quot;) with music composed by Claude-Henri Vic and lyrics by Roland Stéphane Valade. In 1963, she was approached by director Jacques Demy and musician Michel Legrand for the main role of the film &quot;Les parapluies de Cherbourg&quot;, but Aubret was subsequently injured in a car accident when her car skidded on a bend. One person died and three were seriously injured, including pianist Serge Sentis. Aubret was hospitalized in Autun, going through multiple operations and a long rehabilitation. In 1968, she returned to Eurovision and again represented France, this time singing &quot;La source&quot; (&quot;The Spring/Fountain&quot;) with music by Daniel Faure and lyrics by Henri Dijan and Guy Bonnet. 

Aubret was a participant in the French national heats for Eurovision in other years. Her first attempt was in 1961 with the song &quot;Le gars de n&#x27;importe où&quot;. She was awarded second place. Another runner-up spot came Aubret&#x27;s way in 1970 when she teamed up with Daniel Beretta for the song &quot;Olivier, Olivia&quot;. She was not as successful with her 1976 effort, &quot;Je te connais déjà&quot;, which finished sixth out of seven songs in the second semi-final. Her final challenge for Eurovision came in 1983 with the patriotic &quot;France, France&quot;, which took her to third place. 

Working with French composer Michel Colombier, Aubret co-produced the song &quot;C&#x27;est Ainsi Que Les Choses Arrivent&quot; for Jean-Pierre Melville&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Un Flic&quot;. In 1981, Aubret had another accident. She was rehearsing a flying trapeze number for the with her partner, boxer Jean-Claude Bouttier, when she fell and broke both legs. It took two years of rehabilitation for her to walk again.

In 2001, she celebrated her forty-year career by giving a series of concerts at Bobino.

== Personal life ==
Aubret is married to Gérard Meys.

<doc id="1257752" wikidata="Q377591" url="?curid=1257752" title="Broadnose sevengill shark">
<text>The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is the only extant member of the genus &quot;Notorynchus&quot;, in the family Hexanchidae. It is recognizable because of its seven gill slits, while most shark species have five gill slits, with the exception of the members of the order Hexanchiformes and the sixgill sawshark. This shark has a large, thick body, with a broad head and blunt snout. The top jaw has jagged, cusped teeth and the bottom jaw has comb-shaped teeth. Its single dorsal fin is set far back along the spine towards the caudal fin, and is behind the pelvic fins. In this shark the upper caudal fin is much longer than the lower, and is slightly notched near the tip. Like many sharks, this sevengill is counter-shaded. Its dorsal surface is silver-gray to brown in order to blend with the dark water and substrate when viewed from above. In counter to this, its ventral surface is very pale, blending with the sunlit water when viewed from below. The body and fins are covered in a scattering of small black &amp; white spots. In juveniles, their fins often have white margins.

It is also known as sevengill shark or simply sevengill and was formerly known as cow shark and mud shark; it is called sevengill due to its seven gill slits. Because of this, it was listed along with the sharpnose sevengill shark (&quot;Heptranchias perlo&quot;) by Guinness World Records as having the most gill slits. It is similar to the sharpnose sevengill shark but the latter has a pointed snout and lacks spots on its dorsal surface. The sevengill species are also related to ancient sharks as fossils from the Jurassic Period (200 to 145 million years ago) also had seven gills. As recently as the 1930s and 1940s, the shark was targeted by fisheries along the coast of California and, once the commercial fishery receded, recreational fishing of the shark started in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Taxonomy==
===Name===
The genus name &quot;Notorynchus&quot; a portmanteau is derived from the Ancient Greek νῶτον (nôton, meaning &quot;back&quot;) prefixed to the Ancient Greek ῥῠ́γχος (rhúnkhos, meaning &quot;snout&quot;). It has been interpreted that this refers to the spots on the broadnose sevengill&#x27;s dorsal. The specific epithet &quot;cepedianus&quot; is derived from a variation of the name &quot;Lacepede&quot;, which refers to Bernard Germain de Lacépède, a French naturalist during the late 18th and early 19th century. Altogether, the scientific name as a whole literally means &quot;Lacepede&#x27;s back snout&quot;.

The common name &quot;broadnose sevengill shark&quot; refers to the seven gill slits the species possesses and the shape of its snout. Sometimes, the name is shortened to &quot;sevengill shark&quot; or simply &quot;sevengill&quot;. However, a variety of other common names are known in many languages. Other known common names in English include the bluntnose sevengill shark, broad-snout, cowshark, ground shark, seven-gill cowshark, seven-gilled shark, spotted cow shark, spotted seven-gill shark, and Tasmanian tiger shark. Common names from other languages include cação-bruxa (Portuguese), cañabota gata, gatita, tiburón de 7 gallas, tiburón pinto, and tollo fume (Spanish), ebisuzame and minami-ebisuzame (Japanese), gevlekte zevenkieuwshaai (Dutch), Kammzähner and Siebenkiemiger Pazifischer Kammzähner (German), koeihaai (Afrikaans), k&#x27;wet&#x27;thenéchte (Salish), platneus-sewekiefhaai (Afrikaans), platnez and requin malais (French), siedmioszpar plamisty (Polish), and tuatini (Maori).

==Description==
The length at birth is while the &quot;mature male length&quot; is and &quot;mature female length&quot; is around . The maximum length found is . The maximum recorded weight is for a individual. The shark is large and active and has a large head but small eyes and snout. The mouth is broad and prominent. The shark has one dorsal fin at the back of the body that spans from the insertion to the tops of the pelvic fins. The mottled grey and white body is covered in a variable number of small black spots.


==Range and habitat==
The broadnose sevengill has so far been found in the western Pacific Ocean off China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the eastern Pacific Ocean off Canada, United States and Chile, and the southern Atlantic Ocean off Argentina and South Africa. It is significantly found in the San Francisco Bay particularly near the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island. Large, old individuals tend to live in deep offshore environments as far down as . However, most individuals live in either the deep channels of bays, or in the shallower waters of continental shelves and estuaries. These sharks are mainly benthic in nature, cruising along the sea floor and making an occasional foray to the surface. Individuals that live closer to the coast in South Africa tend to prefer more open areas with a sandy sea floor and sparse clumps of kelp.

==Behavior==

An opportunistic predator, the broadnose sevengill preys on a great variety of animals, and has been found at depths of , in offshore waters. It has been found to feed on other sharks (including the gummy shark, one of its main prey choices, and cowsharks), rays, chimaeras, cetaceans, pinnipeds, bony fishes and animal falls (seafloor carrion). It will also feed on anything that fits in its mouth, such as shark egg cases, sea snails, crustaceans and any remains of rats, seabirds, and even deceased drowned humans. Research in 2003 found that its diet consisted of 30% mammals, with a frequency of occurrence of 35%. It is a frequent top predator in shallow waters, and has comb-like teeth, with the upper teeth having slender, smooth edged cusps to swallow small enough prey whole and lower teeth that are broad enough to bite flesh into pieces. These sharks occasionally hunt in packs to take larger prey, using tactics such as stealth to succeed. After feeding, it slowly digests for several days, and can go weeks until eating again. Larger, predatory sharks (such as the great white shark) can be a threat, and cannibalism among this species has also been recorded. The species has also been observed being preyed upon by orcas in False Bay, South Africa. When not actively hunting, it patrols the water, stealthily, while making very little movement except for moving its caudal fin; when prey is detected, they conserve their energy until ready to make an accelerated dash to attack.

It can be one of the most abundant predators in coastal waters in summer; for example, in southeastern Tasmania, there is a high abundance of elasmobranches (including the gummy shark) in coastal regions in summer. In New Zealand, it is also one of the most common inshore sharks. While it is mainly a nocturnal forager, it may opportunistically feed on prey casually found during the day; however, research in 2010 noted even amounts of activity during day and night. During this research, the shark was consistently detected at many depths, from bottom to near the surface, although it was mainly near the seafloor during the day. It also found that, as Norfolk Bay does not have adequate shelter cover, this species may use group formation to avoid predation.

The sevengill, like all other members of Hexanchiformes, is ovoviviparous. The broadnose sevengill lives for about 30 years, although the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife lists a maximum of 49 years, with the males maturing at 4 to 5 years and the female 11 to 21 years; the average reproductive age for a female is 20 to 25 years. After a 12-month gestation period, the female moves to a shallow bay or estuary to give birth between April and May to a large litter of between 82 and 95 pups, measuring .

In 2004 and 2005, along with research for the sand tiger shark, there was research for the broadnose sevengill shark for development techniques for semen collection and artificial insemination to potentially increase breeding and lower overreliance on natural mating. Research in 2010 found that this shark has very poorly calcified vertebrae that cannot be used for age and growth estimations. Research in 2009 in (RD) and (SJ), Argentina found that females were larger in RD than SJ and the heaviest female in RD was 70 kg while it was 36.9 kg in SJ. For the males, the heaviest in RD was 40 kg while it was 32.5 in SJ. Both locations also found the most significant to occur December and January.

Research in 2014 also found that for the first time, reproductive hormones levels were found in the broadnose sevengill shark. for a few years before venturing out. The probable predators of this species are larger sharks. Research from 2002 showed that although juvenile sevengill sharks utilize nursery areas in a similar way, males mature faster than females even if they are the same size and thus males are more likely to leave the nursery area before females.

In 2004, John G Maisey of the American Museum of Natural History published a detailed analysis of the broadnose sevengill shark including imagery such as CT scans and morphology of its braincase.

==Interactions with humans==
The ISAF considers this shark to be potentially dangerous because of its proximity to humans, and because of its aggressive behavior when provoked. It has also been noted as being aggressive towards divers and spearfishermen in both public aquariums and the wild. In 2013, in Fiordland, New Zealand, a sevengill bit a diver&#x27;s regulator and then her head. Human remains were also supposedly found in one specimen&#x27;s stomach. Seven attacks on humans by the broadnose sevengill have been recorded since the 16th century, with no known fatalities . In 2020 a 13 year old girl was bitten while surfing at Oreti Beach in New Zealand. The girl continued to surf for an hour before realizing her leg was bleeding.

==Conservation status==

The broadnose sevengill is listed by the IUCN Red List as Vulnerable throughout its range. This species likely suffers great ongoing pressure from various types of fisheries, and from frequently being caught as bycatch. In Argentina, it&#x27;s fished by rod and reel and broadnose sevengill shark fishing competitions have been occurring since the 1960s. It is also threatened by water pollution and is hunted for its liveroil and hide which is considered good quality in places such as China. In the early 1980s, intense fishing in the San Francisco Bay caused a local decline. In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the broadnose sevengill shark as &quot;Not Threatened&quot; with the qualifiers &quot;Data Poor&quot; and &quot;Secure Overseas&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

Its meat and fins are in demand in countries such as the US, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Netherlands and Israel, and is packaged for frozen food. The broadnose sevengill is also a source of vitamin A and utilized by South African sport anglers for winter tournaments, however, this shark is not easy to land despite being readily hooked.

It is frequently seen by tourists and in temperate water aquariums and can adapt to captivity. One of the aquariums that houses the broadnose sevengill shark, Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport, Oregon, has featured it as a &quot;keynote species&quot;. There is also an app Sevengill Shark Tracking &quot;Shark Observers&quot; that allows divers to log sightings that are added to the Shark Observation Network, where the information supports &quot;environmental awareness, assessment and policy making, and public participation at a global level&quot;.

Not many conservation measures are known but it has been recorded from one marine reserve in South Africa and it occurs in La Jolla Cove, La Jolla, San Diego, California with the latter having an apparent population increase in 2013. 2009 research also suggested that be made a conservation area given the high number of sharks there. In Washington state, recreational fishing of broadnose sevengill shark is closed on all state waters. In Victoria, Australia, the Department of Environment and Primary Industries sets a one bag limit and must be whole or in carcass form.

<doc id="1257757" wikidata="Q310710" url="?curid=1257757" title="Paulo da Silva">
<text>Paulo César da Silva Barrios (born 1 February 1980) is a Paraguayan former professional international footballer who played as a centre-back. He is one of the players in football with most official appearances ever with over 1,039 official appearances.

He played top-flight football in Mexico, Paraguay, Spain, England, Italy and Argentina, mostly in Mexico, where in 2015 became a naturalized Mexican citizen.

He played for the Paraguay national team from 2000 to 2017, and is their most-capped player of all time, earning over 100 caps, with the Paraguayan Football Association recognizing 150 caps, but FIFA 148. He played at two World Cups and four Copa América tournaments, helping his country finish as runners-up in the 2011 Copa América.

A player highly regarded, in December 2023, featured in a legends match organized by CONMEBOL.

== Club career ==
=== Early career ===
Born in Asunción, Da Silva started his career in the youth divisions of Atlántida Sport Club, arriving at the club at the age of 13. In 1996, da Silva reached the Primera División Paraguaya with Asunción team Presidente Hayes at the age of 16.

=== Mexico ===
Before joining Toluca, da Silva played for Perugia and Venezia of Italy, and Lanús of Argentina. He joined Toluca from Paraguayan Club Libertad for the 2003 Apertura. After making his debut, da Silva was a mainstay in Toluca&#x27;s defence, starting all but one game that he has played and eventually becoming the team&#x27;s captain due to his leadership on the field. In 2007, he was chosen for the &quot;Ideal Eleven&quot; squad of South America and in 2008 he led Toluca to the Apertura 2008 title, being chosen as the best overall player of the tournament by the Mexican media.

=== Sunderland ===
On 13 July 2009, Da Silva joined English club Sunderland on a three-year deal. Manager Steve Bruce said &quot;I&#x27;m delighted to have signed a player of Paulo&#x27;s experience. He is captain of his country and has played at the highest level in South America, so will bring leadership qualities to our side.&quot; His arrival at the Stadium of Light was followed by a long and confusing period in regards to his visa application. Da Silva was granted a work permit to play in England almost immediately, but had to wait for over a month to get his visa before it was eventually granted on 12 August.

He made his debut on 24 August against Norwich City in the League Cup second round, playing the whole 90 minutes of a 4–1 away win. On 12 September he made his first Premier League appearance, replacing Steed Malbranque for the final ten minutes of a 4–1 home win over Hull City.

Da Silva was rotated throughout his first season at the club, but performed consistently when required. Manager Steve Bruce cited &#x27;settlement&#x27; as the reason behind playing Da Silva in phases, stating he needed time to adjust to the English game and lifestyle. He was joined at the club by his international teammate Cristian Riveros in May 2010. Da Silva&#x27;s second season at Sunderland saw him make just three appearances, only one as a starter. His last appearance for Sunderland came in their home defeat to Notts County in the FA Cup on 8 January 2011.

=== Real Zaragoza ===
Da Silva joined Real Zaragoza from Sunderland on 31 January 2011 for an undisclosed fee, with his new club in 15th in La Liga at the time. They finished the season in 13th.

=== Toluca ===
Da Silva re-joined Toluca on 31 May 2013 in a two-year loan deal from Pachuca.

On 11 May 2015, Toluca announced they had signed da Silva permanently.

In December 2015, da Silva received a Mexican naturalization to disoccupy a foreign place in Toluca&#x27;s team.

=== Return to Paraguay ===
On 26 June 2017, Da Silva returned to Paraguay to play for Club Libertad.

In March 2020, da Silva stated that he wanted to retire at Atlántida Asunción.

In December 2021, the 41-year-old da Silva announced that the 2022 season would be his last.

However, in 2023 he returned to playing for Independiente CG of 2023 Paraguayan División Intermedia first and later for 12 de Junio of 2023 Paraguayan Primera B Nacional. At the end of the season, da Silva was linked to becoming assistant manager next to Uruguayan Sergio Órteman and was announced as such for Sol de América, next to Humberto Ovelar, but, in 2024, he again returned to playing for Atlántida Sport Club in 2024 Primera División B, the club he commenced his career, where the 44-year-old da Silva announced it will be his last season playing. On 20 October 2024, after the final match of the season, Da Silva retired from playing.

== International career ==
In 1994, da Silva was selected for the Paraguay U17 national team barely aged 14.

In 2000, da Silva represented Paraguay U23 at the 2000 CONMEBOL Men Pre-Olympic Tournament.

He played for Paraguay in 1997 and 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship, but missed the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan. However, he was named in the 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. He also played at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, featuring in all five of Paraguay&#x27;s games in their run to the quarter-finals, and provided an assist for Sunderland teammate Cristian Riveros in their 2–0 win against Slovakia in the group stages.

== Managerial career ==

In 2023, at the end of the season, da Silva was linked to becoming assistant manager next to Uruguayan Sergio Órteman and was announced as such for Sol de América, next to Humberto Ovelar, but, in 2024, he again returned to playing for Atlántida Sport Club in 2024 Primera División B, the club he commenced his career, where the 44-year-old da Silva announced it will be his last season playing.

<text>Mount Gongga (), also known as Minya Konka (Khams Tibetan: , Khams Tibetan pinyin: &quot;Mi&#x27;nyâg Gong&#x27;ga Riwo&quot;) and colloquially as &quot;The King of Sichuan Mountains&quot;, is the highest mountain in Sichuan province, China. It has an elevation of above sea level. This makes it the third highest peak in the world outside of the Himalaya/Karakoram range, after Tirich Mir and Kongur Tagh, and the easternmost and most isolated peak in the world. It is situated in the Daxue Shan mountain range, between Dadu River and Yalong River, and is part of the Hengduan mountainous region. From it comes the Hailuogou glacier. 

The peak has large vertical relief over the deep nearby gorges.

==Mountaineering history==
The first western explorers in this region heard reports of an extremely high mountain and sought it out. An early remote measurement of the mountain, then called &quot;Bokunka&quot;, was first performed by the Inner Asian expedition of the Hungarian count Béla Széchenyi between 1877 and 1880. That survey put the altitude of the peak at .

Forty-five years later, the mountain, this time called &quot;Gang ka&quot;, was sketched by China Inland Mission missionary James Huston Edgar from a distance.

In 1929 the explorer Joseph Rock, in an attempt to measure the mountain&#x27;s altitude, miscalculated its height as and cabled the National Geographic Society to announce Minya Konka as the highest mountain in the world. This measurement was immediately viewed with suspicion, and the Society&#x27;s decision to check Rock&#x27;s calculations before publication was well-founded. Following discussions with the Society, Rock reduced his claim to in his formal publication.

In 1930 Swiss geographer Eduard Imhof led an expedition that measured the altitude of the mountain to be . A richly illustrated large-format book about the expedition was eventually published by Imhof, &quot;Die Großen Kalten Berge von Szetchuan&quot; (Orell Fussli Verlag, Zurich, 1974). The book includes many color paintings by Imhof, including images of the Tibetan monastery at the foot of the sacred mountain. The monastery was almost completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, around 1972–74.

A properly equipped American team composed of Terris Moore, Richard Burdsall, Arthur B. Emmons, and Jack T. Young returned to the mountain in 1932 and performed an accurate survey of the peak and its environs. Their summit altitude measurement agreed with Imhof&#x27;s figure of . Moore and Burdsall succeeded in climbing to the summit by starting on the west side of the mountain and climbing the Northwest Ridge. This was a remarkable achievement at the time, considering the height of the mountain, its remoteness, and the small size of the group. In addition, this peak was the highest summit reached by Americans until 1958 (though Americans had by that time climbed to higher non-summit points). The book written by the expedition members, &quot;Men Against The Clouds&quot;, remains a mountaineering classic.

In May 1957 a Chinese mountaineering team claimed to have climbed Minya Konka via the Northwest Ridge route established by Moore and Burdsall. Six people reached the summit with limited climbing experience and primitive equipment, although four climbers died in the effort.

For political reasons, this region of China was made inaccessible to foreign climbers after the 1930s. In 1980 the region was again opened to foreign expeditions. American Lance Owens was the first foreigner to receive permission from the People&#x27;s Republic of China to lead a mountaineering expedition in China and Tibet, allowing him to climb Gongga Shan (Minya Konka) in 1980. This expedition opened the modern era of American climbing in China. The expedition, organized by Owens and sponsored by the American Alpine Club, attempted the still unclimbed and extremely technical west face of Minya Konka. Members of the expedition included Louis Reichardt, Andrew Harvard, Gary Bocarde, Jed Williamson, and Henry Barber.

==Deaths on the mountain==
A large number of mountaineering deaths have occurred on Gongga Shan, which has earned a reputation as a difficult and dangerous mountain. While the first ascent route up the Northwest Ridge appears technically straightforward, it is plagued by avalanches due to the mountain&#x27;s highly unpredictable weather. During the 1957 Chinese ascent of the peak, four of nine climbers died. In 1980 an American climber died in an avalanche on the Northwest Ridge route. In an unsuccessful 1981 attempt on the peak, eight Japanese climbers died in a fall. As of 1999, more climbers had died trying to climb the mountain than had reached the summit.

As of 2003, the mountain had been successfully climbed only eight times. In total, 22 climbers had reached the summit and 16 climbers had died in the effort. (These statistics may not take into account the four Chinese climbers killed in the 1957 expedition.)

The Himalayan Index lists five ascents of Gongga Shan between 1982 and 2002, and about seven unsuccessful attempts. There have been several attempts in years since then, which are unlisted in this index.

In October 2017, Chinese media reported that Pavel Kořínek, a Czech national, had reached the top of Gongga Shan, marking the first time since 2002 that the mountain had been successfully climbed. The article summarized the climbing history of Gongga Shan (Minya Konka) as follows:

<doc id="1257770" wikidata="Q1076696" url="?curid=1257770" title="Tim Drake">
<text>Timothy Jackson &quot;Tim&quot; Drake is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. Created by Marv Wolfman and Pat Broderick, he first appeared in (August 1989) as the third character to assume the role of Batman&#x27;s crime-fighting partner and sidekick [[Tim Drake|Robin]]. Following the events of &quot;&quot; in 2009, Drake adopted the identity of [[Red Robin (identity)|Red Robin]]. In 2019, Tim returned to his original Robin persona and briefly used the mononym &quot;Drake&quot;.

As a young boy, Tim was in the audience the night Dick Grayson&#x27;s parents were murdered and later managed to discover the identities of Batman and the original Robin through their exploits. After the death of the second Robin, Jason Todd, and witnessing Batman spiral into darkness, Tim attempted to convince Dick to resume the role of Robin, stating that &quot;Batman needs a Robin&quot;. However, Dick refused to return to being Batman&#x27;s sidekick, and instead, Tim was appointed as the third Robin. Neal Adams redesigned the entire &quot;Robin&quot; costume specifically for Tim Drake&#x27;s character, with the sole exception of the redesigned &quot;R&quot; logo by Norm Breyfogle.

Subsequent stories emphasize Tim&#x27;s superior detective skills compared to the previous two Robins, which make him more similar to Batman. He succeeded Dick as the leader of the Teen Titans, and later led his superhero team, Young Justice. He was briefly followed in the role of Robin by Stephanie Brown, and later for a longer period by Batman&#x27;s biological son, Damian Wayne, during the time Tim operated as Red Robin. Tim has been shown to have a close friendship with Superboy. His most high-profile romantic pairings have been with superheroes Stephanie Brown and Cassie Sandsmark, and later civilian boyfriend Bernard Dowd.

In 2011, Tim Drake was ranked 32nd in IGN&#x27;s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes. He has also been featured in various adaptations, including several television series, such as those set in the DCAU, &quot;Young Justice&quot; (2010–2022), and &quot;Titans&quot; (2018–2023) as well as the &quot;&quot; video game series.

==Publication history==
Tim Drake was created to succeed Jason Todd as Robin after DC killed off Todd in their story &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;. Named after Tim Burton, director of the then-upcoming 1989 film, Tim first appeared in 1989&#x27;s &quot;&quot; by the writer Marv Wolfman and interior penciler Pat Broderick, before having his origin detailed in &quot;Batman: A Lonely Place of Dying&quot;, a crossover story between the ongoing series &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;New Titans&quot;, written by Wolfman and penciled by George Pérez and Jim Aparo (the latter with inks by Mike DeCarlo), in which he first introduced himself to Dick Grayson and impressed the former Robin with his skills. This led Grayson and later Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne&#x27;s butler, to support Tim&#x27;s request to be Batman&#x27;s new partner. Not wanting to make the same mistake as he did with Jason Todd, Batman had Tim endure an intensive period of training that was never given to his predecessors. As such, Tim remained a non-superhero supporting character for the first year of his regular appearances in the &quot;Batman&quot; title, mainly operating in the Batcave.

According to Marv Wolfman, Tim was created to stand out from Grayson and Todd by having high intellect, a strong sense of justice and family outside of Batman&#x27;s own.

The ensuing Tim Drake storylines, authored by the Alan Grant and penciled by Norm Breyfogle, coupled with the 1989 release of Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;, spurred sales of both &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. For the latter title, Grant attested in 2007 that &quot;when the &quot;Batman&quot; movie came out, the sales went up, if I recall correctly, from around 75,000 to about 675,000.&quot; 1989-90 was indeed the &quot;Year of the Bat:&quot; Capital and Diamond City Distributors reported that the &quot;&quot;-inspired &quot;&quot; dominated four out of the five spots for preorders (&quot;not&quot; total sales and second printings). The only exception was the third preorder spot, snagged by &quot;Batman&quot; #442, the conclusion to Tim Drake&#x27;s &quot;A Lonely Place of Dying&quot; storyline. The &quot;Year of the Bat&quot; continued into the first half of 1990. Preorders for &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; issues featuring a revived Joker and Penguin began to compete with, and even edged out, the last three parts of Grant Morrison&#x27;s and Klaus Janson&#x27;s &quot;&quot; storyline in &quot;Legends&quot;. Todd McFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; arrived in the second half of 1990, inaugurating six months of Spidermania (or Mcfarlamania, depending on the reader). DC closed out 1990 with vendors under-ordering issues, prompting the publisher to push &quot;Batman&quot; #457 and the first part of the &quot;Robin&quot; mini-series into second and then third printings. The next year, 1991, witnessed the ascension of Chris Claremont&#x27;s, Jim Lee&#x27;s, and Scott Williams&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; against Magneto, as well as Fabian Nicieza&#x27;s and Rob Liefeld&#x27;s &quot;X-Force&quot;, into the top of the preorder rankings. The only exception to this X-mania was, again, Tim Drake and the sequel to the &quot;Robin&quot; miniseries, the first variant issue of which garnered the third spot, firmly wedged between variant issues of &quot;X-Force&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;. The mini-series pitted solo Robin against the Joker, in response to fan demands for a matchup since &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;. The 1990s comics booming bust had begun. In a supplemental interview with Daniel Best, Alan Grant added that &quot;every issue from about that time [after the &#x27;Year of the Bat&#x27;] that featured Robin sales went up because Robin did have his fans.&quot; Although both Grant and Breyfogle initially believed that their &quot;Anarky&quot; character could potentially become the third version of Robin, they were quick to support the editorial decision to focus on Drake. The social anarchist duo adopted the character as their own in the early 1990s, during Grant&#x27;s shift to libertarian socialism but before his late 1990s emphasis on Neo Tech. Breyfogle agreed that &quot;it was a big thing to bring in the new Robin, yes. I know my fans often point specifically to that double-page splash where his costume first appears as a big event for them as fans and I usually have to point out to them that Neal Adams was the one who designed the costume. The &#x27;R&#x27; symbol and the staff were all that was mine.&quot; In the &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; storyline for &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, Grant and Breyfogle intertwined 1) Drake matching wits with Anarky; 2) a criminal and anthropological investigation into an apocryphal Haitian &quot;Vodou&quot; cult (revealed by Batman, asserting anthropological and investigative authority, as a front for extortion and crony capitalism); 3) the murder of Drake&#x27;s mother by vilified cult leaders; 4) the beginning of Drake&#x27;s recurrent nightmares and trauma; as well as 5) the perspective of a child of one of the cult&#x27;s Haitian followers, unknowingly and inadvertently orphaned by Batman at the end of the four-issue arc.

Tim Drake eventually transitioned from preadolescence to adolescence, becoming the third Robin throughout the storylines &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; and &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, with all issues scripted by Alan Grant and penciled by Norm Breyfogle. Story arcs that included Drake only in subplots or featured his training in criminal investigation, such as &quot;Crimesmith&quot; and &quot;The Penguin Affair&quot;, were either written or co-written by Grant and Wolfman, with pencils by Breyfogle, Aparo, and M. D. Bright. Immediately afterwards, the character starred in the five-issue miniseries &quot;Robin,&quot; written by Chuck Dixon, with interior pencils by Tom Lyle and cover art by Brian Bolland. The new Batman and Robin team went on their first official mission together in the story &quot;Debut&quot;, again written by Grant and penciled by Breyfogle. Lauren R. O&#x27;Connor contends that, in early Tim Drake appearances, writers such as Grant and Chuck Dixon &quot;had a lexicon of teenage behavior from which to draw, unlike when Dick Grayson was introduced and the concept of the teenager was still nascent. They wisely mobilized the expected adolescent behaviors of parental conflict, hormonal urges, and identity formation to give Tim emotional depth and complexity, making him a relatable character with boundaries between his two selves.&quot; In the &quot;Robin&quot; ongoing series, when Drake had fully transitioned into an adolescent character, Chuck Dixon depicted him as engaging in adolescent intimacy, yet still stopped short at overt heterosexual consummation. This narrative benchmark maintained Robin&#x27;s &quot;estrangement from sex&quot; that began in the Grayson years. Erica McCrystal likewise observes that Alan Grant, prior to Dixon&#x27;s series, connected Drake to Batman&#x27;s philosophy of heroic or anti-heroic &quot;vigilantism&quot; as &quot;therapeutic for children of trauma. But this kind of therapy has a delicate integration process.&quot; The overcoming of trauma entailed distinct identity intersections and emotional restraint, as well as a &quot;complete understanding&quot; of symbol and self. Bruce Wayne, a former child of trauma and survivor guilt, guided &quot;other trauma victims down a path of righteousness.&quot; Tim Drake, for example, endured trauma and &quot;emotional duress&quot; as a result of the death of his mother (his father was in a coma and on a ventilator). Drake contemplated the idea of fear, and overcoming it, in both the &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; and &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; storylines. Grant and Breyfogle subjected Drake to recurrent nightmares, from hauntings by a ghoulish Batman to the disquieting lullaby (or informal nursery rhyme), &quot;My Mummy&#x27;s dead...My Mummy&#x27;s Dead...I can&#x27;t get it through my head,&quot; echoing across a cemetery for deceased parents. Drake ultimately defeated his preadolescent fears &quot;somewhat distant from Bruce Wayne&quot; and &quot;not as an orphan.&quot; By the end of &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, an adolescent Drake had &quot;proven himself as capable of being a vigilante&quot; by deducing the role of fear in instigating a series of violent crimes.

As the character continued to appear in the main Batman titles, the original &quot;Robin&quot; miniseries was followed by the four-issue miniseries &quot;Robin II: The Joker&#x27;s Wild!&quot;(December 1991-February 1992) and the six-issue miniseries &quot;Robin III: Cry of the Huntress&quot; (December 1992-March 1993) both also written by Dixon. Due to the success of these miniseries, DC launched the first ongoing monthly &quot;Robin&quot; series in its history, once again written by Dixon, with Tim Drake as its main adolescent character. The ongoing series continued for over 15 years, ending with issue #183. Mike Mullins on &quot;Newsarama&quot; has stated:

Throughout [the entire Robin series], the character of Robin has been captured consistently, showing him to step up to greater and greater challenges. Robin is a character who shows initiative and is driven to do what he views as right. He knows he is living up to a legacy left by Dick Grayson and strives to not disappoint Bruce Wayne, Batman. Tim is a more natural detective than previous Robins and is talented with computers, which allows him to stand in his unique spotlight. Unlike his predecessors, Tim is not the most proficient combatant and has had to work on his fighting technique, taking up the bo staff to give him an edge that Batman does not need. Tim almost always seeks to analyze a problem and outthink his opponent but has shown the ability to win a fight when necessary.

During this period, the character also featured prominently in the comic series &quot;Young Justice&quot;, written by Peter David, as a core team member from 1998 to 2003. Subsequently, Tim Drake also became a prominent team member in the new incarnation of &quot;Teen Titans&quot; written by Geoff Johns, from 2003 to 2011.

The ongoing series &quot;Robin&quot; (vol. 4) was written by Chuck Dixon until issue #100, in which the series was handed off to Jon Lewis. Lewis&#x27;s run as a writer concluded with issue #120. Bill Willingham wrote the series for issues #121-147. As part of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;One Year Later&quot; relaunch initiative, in which the events of all ongoing titles skipped forward one year, Adam Beechen took over as writer on &quot;Robin&quot; with issue #148. Later, a return to the title by Chuck Dixon was aborted abruptly upon his departure from DC again. The final nine issues of the series were written by Fabian Nicieza, tying into the then-ongoing &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; storyline.

Following the miniseries &quot;Batman: Battle For the Cowl&quot;, Tim Drake took on the new identity of the Red Robin as the character Damian Wayne was made the new Robin. The character began starring in a new &quot;Red Robin&quot; ongoing series, written for its first twelve issues by Christopher Yost and thereafter by Fabian Nicieza. The series was canceled along with the rest of DC&#x27;s publishing line for The New 52 reboot.

In &quot;The New 52&quot; period, Tim Drake primarily appeared as a main character in the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; series, with some guest appearances in the Batman titles, under the superhero name Red Robin. Tim was also the main character in the 26-issue weekly series &quot;Batman and Robin Eternal&quot; alongside the other former Robins. Meanwhile, a version of Tim from five years into the future was also a main character in the weekly series &quot;The New 52: Futures End&quot;; this alternate-future version of Tim would become the title character in the subsequent &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; series up until its relaunch with &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;.

As of the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch, Tim Drake became the main character in the series &quot;Detective Comics&quot; written by James Tynion IV where it was reinvented as a team book. The character featured in issues #934-940 and #965-981, with some flashback appearances in the interim.

The character has subsequently become a main character in the relaunched &quot;Young Justice&quot; series written by Brian Michael Bendis.

The character received widespread media attention when it was revealed that he was bisexual in DC&#x27;s relaunch initiative Infinite Frontier through &quot;Batman: Urban Legends&quot; #6 (August 2021), written by Meghan Fitzmartin. This reveal made Tim notable for being one of the most prominent LGBT characters in comic books. He subsequently received a story in &quot;DC Pride 2022&quot; and his own &quot;Tim Drake: Pride Special&quot; before DC announced a new ongoing series written by Fitzmartin. The series, &quot;Tim Drake: Robin&quot;, launched on September 27, 2022 and ran for 10 issues, ending on June 27, 2023. He also was concurrently a main character in the series &quot;Batman&quot; written by Chip Zdarsky. He was featured in issues starting from #125, and in &quot;The Toy Box&quot; back up story starting from issue #131. 

&quot;Tim Drake: Robin&quot; received a nomination for Outstanding Comic Book at the 34th GLAAD Media Awards.

==Fictional character biography==

===Introduction===
Tim Drake is the son of Jack Drake and Janet Drake, coming from the same social class as Bruce Wayne. When he was a young child, he visited the circus for the first time with his parents. The Drakes asked the Flying Graysons for a photo together, resulting in a momentary bond between Tim and Dick Grayson as they met for the first time. Dick Grayson&#x27;s parents were murdered that night, as witnessed by Tim from the audience.

Growing up, Tim&#x27;s parents were frequently absent for months at a time as they traveled around the world on archaeological digs and thus he was left in a boarding school with relatively little adult supervision. By the age of nine, Tim, who had a very sharp intellect, had deduced the identities of Batman and Robin as Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, after witnessing a gymnastic maneuver by Robin that he previously saw Grayson display in the Haly Circus. Inspired by the heroes&#x27; exploits, Tim trained himself in martial arts, acrobatics, detective skills, and scholastics to better himself both physically and intellectually, though having no intention of joining Batman one day, mainly for his self-fulfillment. When Tim reached the age of thirteen, he saw that Batman had grown reckless and violent following the second Robin (Jason Todd)&#x27;s murder by the Joker. Reasoning that &quot;Batman needs a Robin&quot;, Tim at first approached Dick Grayson – who had since become Nightwing – to ask him to become Robin again. Dick refused, but Tim&#x27;s actions in an encounter with Two-Face prompted him and Alfred Pennyworth to see Tim as a potential third Robin. Batman agreed to mentor Tim, train him, and use his assistance in the Batcave, but at first refused to involve Tim in the field out of concern for the boy&#x27;s safety, not wanting a repeat of Jason&#x27;s fate. After a series of events involving Tim&#x27;s mother&#x27;s death and his father&#x27;s paralysis, and Tim rescuing Batman in an encounter with the Scarecrow, Batman eventually enlisted him as the third Robin at the age of fourteen.

===&quot;Robin&quot; (vol. 2) (1989–2009)===

Before joining Batman as the third Robin, Tim Drake was given a modern redesign of the Robin costume and sent to train abroad with numerous experts to refine his martial arts. When Bruce Wayne retires after &quot;&quot;, Robin goes solo to defend Gotham City. Robin would eventually go on to co-star with other teenaged superheroes in &quot;Young Justice&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans&quot;. He also made guest appearances in other DC comic books such as &quot;Nightwing&quot; and &quot;Azrael&quot;.

Robin would also become increasingly closer to fellow teen vigilante Stephanie Brown, also known as the Spoiler. Although at first, he regarded her as reckless in operating without Batman&#x27;s guidance, the two would eventually become romantically involved. For a brief period when Tim&#x27;s father found out about him being Robin and he retired from the role, Stephanie temporarily replaced him as the new Robin.

Following the death of his father in &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; (2004) and the presumed death of Stephanie in &quot;&quot; (2004–2005), Tim relocated to Blüdhaven, the city where Nightwing fights crime, for a period of time to escape the &quot;ghosts&quot; of Gotham City and to stay close to his stepmother Dana Winters, who was admitted into a Blüdhaven clinic after going into psychological shock over Captain Boomerang killing Jack Drake.

Tim Drake was then given another redesign of the Robin costume with a red and black color scheme. The colors are those of Superboy&#x27;s costume, in tribute to his best friend Superboy after he also died in battle in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2005–2006).

Once Dick takes over the role of Batman after Bruce&#x27;s apparent death in &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, he fires Tim from the Robin mantle and gives it to Damian Wayne, due to Dick believing he and Tim are equals. Tim, believing that Bruce is still alive, assumes the identity of Red Robin and leaves Gotham City to go on a worldwide search for Wayne.

===&quot;Red Robin&quot; (2009–2011)===
&quot;Red Robin&quot;, which was launched in late 2009, depicted Tim Drake&#x27;s search to find evidence that Bruce Wayne was still alive after cutting himself off from the rest of the Bat-family. He was approached by Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s assassins, who were also interested in finding out what happened to Batman. At the same time, Tamara &quot;Tam&quot; Fox, Lucius Fox&#x27;s daughter, has been sent to find Tim Drake to bring him back to Gotham. Tim goes to Iraq and manages to discover definitive proof that Bruce was alive and lost in time, but was ambushed by an assassin from the Council of Spiders. He manages to drive himself and Pru (one of the assassins working for Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, who had become an ally of Tim&#x27;s) to Tam&#x27;s hotel room, and they are promptly abducted by the League of Assassins.

Although initially reluctant, Tim Drake allied with Ra&#x27;s before nearly bleeding to death due to their encounter with the Council of Spiders. He was put in charge of the League of Assassins by Ra&#x27;s and used the time to simultaneously plan how to stop the Council of Spiders and destroy the League of Assassins. After failing to foil all but one of the Council&#x27;s assassination attempts, Tim realizes that the Council will be attacking the League&#x27;s base, and realizes that he left Tam in danger at the base. Rushing back to base, he simultaneously manages to delay the Council of Spiders, blow up the League&#x27;s base, and escape with Tam.

After crippling Ra&#x27;s&#x27; League of Assassins, Drake returns to Gotham City to overthrow Ra&#x27;s&#x27; plans to use Hush (surgically altered to resemble Bruce Wayne) to gain control of the Wayne family resources and destroy all that Batman held dear by directing his assassins to target all of the Batman&#x27;s associates. Realizing that these attacks are a smokescreen and that the real target is coercing Hush to sign away Wayne Enterprises, Red Robin decides to confront Ra&#x27;s head-on. He calls upon all of his friends to protect the various targets. Drake has since moved back to Gotham City and reestablished ties with his family and friends.

After Bruce Wayne&#x27;s return, Tim begins to aid his plans for expanding their mission globally with Batman, Inc. Tim is eventually appointed as the head of the newest incarnation of the Outsiders that now serve as Batman Inc.&#x27;s black-ops wing. Red Robin eventually rejoins the Teen Titans and takes over leadership from Wonder Girl. He remains the team&#x27;s leader during their climactic battle against Superboy-Prime and the new Legion of Doom.

Following an adventure with the Black Bat where he faces Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s sister, Tim stalks and attempts to kill a revived Captain Boomerang during the &quot;Brightest Day&quot;. Though Tim ultimately stops himself from killing Boomerang, he is chastised by Batman for his actions.

===&quot;The New 52&quot; (2011–2016)===

In September 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, &quot;Teen Titans&quot; (vol. 4) #0 revealed Tim Drake&#x27;s new origin, showing a large departure from his original origin, removing his connections to Dick Grayson&#x27;s origin story. In &quot;The New 52&quot;, Tim is a talented athlete and computer genius who comes close to discovering Batman&#x27;s identity, but never totally figures it out. When Tim finds the Batman and gets rejected for the role of sidekick, he decides to bring the Batman to him, by hacking the Penguin&#x27;s bank account and donating millions of dollars, thus putting his family in danger. The Penguin&#x27;s goons come after Tim and his family, but Batman saves them. Tim&#x27;s parents are forced to go into witness protection, but they believe Tim deserves better and ask Bruce to take care of him for them. The Witness Protection Program renames him &quot;Tim Drake&quot;, and he takes on the identity of the &quot;Red Robin&quot;, rather than that of &quot;Robin&quot;, out of respect to Jason Todd. In later issues, he is shown to be a founding member of the Teen Titans as well as their leader and he shows feelings for Wonder Girl which are reciprocated.

Tim was unwilling to meet with the rest of the Bat-family at the Batcave after he was infected with the Joker&#x27;s new compound &quot;HA&quot;. He was present when Damian was killed by the Heretic and admitted to Bruce that even though he had a dysfunctional relationship with Damian that he did grieve for him. He was also at the final battle between Batman and the Heretic when Talia killed her son&#x27;s clone and blew up Wayne Tower.

Tim was also part of the Bat-family&#x27;s assembled team which went to Apokolips to retrieve Damian&#x27;s body. As their mission focused on retrieving Robin, Tim, Jason, and Barbara wore costumes that resembled Damian&#x27;s colors and each wore a Robin symbol. Following the completion of their mission and the revival of Damian, he handed him the Robin symbol on his suit to welcome Damian back to life and the role of Robin.

In the Pre-&quot;Convergence&quot; timeline of &quot;Futures End&quot;, refugees from Earth-2 are given a signal from Brother Eye, which allows them into the Earth-0 Universe, but start a war when Darkseid follows them, leading to the deaths of the Teen Titans, except for Drake. Tim abandons his Red Robin mantle and becomes a bartender until an attack by Brainiac, where changes to the timeline are made. Brainiac is captured, and Terry McGinnis dies at the hands of Brother Eye&#x27;s Batman-Joker hybrid. Tim dons the Batman Beyond suit and goes back in time and prevents Brother Eye from sending the signal to Earth-2, creating a new future where there is less destruction, and the events of &quot;Convergence&quot; and everything afterward takes place. Tim is launched into the new future, 35 years later, where he becomes the new Batman and destroys a weakened Brother Eye.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot; (2016–2021)===
In &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Tim Drake still operates under the Red Robin alias. He gains a new and third overall Red Robin suit similar to his first Robin suit except with two &quot;R&quot;s as his logo instead of one. It is revealed later on in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #965 that Tim Drake&#x27;s origin story has reverted to that of the original universe, where he discovers Batman and Robin&#x27;s identities after Jason Todd&#x27;s death and became Robin before adopting the Red Robin persona.

Tim is primarily featured in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; as part of Batman and Batwoman&#x27;s new team in Gotham, along with Orphan, Spoiler, and Clayface. Batman and Batwoman were preparing this group to combat enemies known as the Colonists, later revealed to be a military group under the command of Batwoman&#x27;s father, Jake Kane, who have modeled themselves after Batman in a more violent matter. After the team rescues Batman and Tim hacks their database to discover their plans, Jake sends two waves of Bat-Drones to take down the &quot;League of Shadows&quot;, which will kill hundreds of innocents in the process. As his teammates evacuate the locations the drones were sent to, Tim hacks the drone&#x27;s mission directive to make himself the sole target, knowing that the drones will stop once the target is eliminated.

While Tim manages to take down the first wave of drones, he is killed apparently by the second wave, devastating the Bat-family and his former Teen Titans teammates. However, just before Tim was blasted by the second wave, he is teleported to an unknown place by Mister Oz and kept prisoner. Tim swore that his friends will find him.

Later, Batman learns from Ascalon, a robotic entity created by the Order of St. Dumas, that Tim is still alive, with Batman resolving to find Tim.

In Mr. Oz&#x27;s prison, Tim is forced to relive his memories of the past by Mr. Oz. Realizing that Mr. Oz is using Kryptonian technology, Tim easily hacks into it and frees himself as Mr. Oz reveals his identity as Jor-El and disappears. As he tries to find a way out, Tim finds Batman but discovers this version of Batman is Tim Drake from the &quot;Titans Tomorrow&quot; future. Unable to accept a future where he decides to become Batman, Tim is forced to aid his older self in evading and containing a freed Doomsday. Tim learns from his future self that Dick, Jason, and Damian all tried to be Batman, but either retired or was forced to be put down by Tim (in the case of Damian). After Doomsday is lured back to his cell, both Tims teleport out of Mr. Oz&#x27;s prison and arrive in Gotham in the &quot;Titans Tomorrow&quot; future. Before being sent back, Tim is asked by his future self to apologize to Conner, but the younger Tim has no idea who Conner is, although he later admits that the name is tugging at his heart, though he does not know why. Tim is incapacitated by his future self, as the latter decides to go back in time to kill Batwoman, the apparent cause of Tim becoming Batman. Tim returns to Gotham and is reunited with the Bat-family, but warns them about Future Tim.

After a battle with Ulysses Armstrong and Brother Eye, Tim leaves Gotham to investigate the alternate timelines, and Tim&#x27;s restored memories of his past friends from Young Justice. This leads him to Metropolis, where he is reunited with Wonder Girl and Impulse, and meets Teen Lantern and Ginny Hex. The five young heroes later travel to Gemworld, where they are also reunited with Superboy and meet Princess Amethyst. Soon lost in the Multiverse, Young Justice struggles to return home, with Tim taking on the new identity of Drake during an attack by his Earth-3 counterpart. However, this identity was retired shortly after returning to his universe, and Tim returned to being Robin.

=== Infinite Frontier (2021-present) ===
Following Infinite Frontier, Tim&#x27;s history is smoothed over again, restoring his pre-New 52 histories as Batman&#x27;s third apprentice and re-establishing him as having been Robin since that time. In &quot;Batman: Urban Legends&quot;, it is revealed that he and Stephanie Brown broke up off-panel and he reconnected with a friend from high school, Bernard Dowd. Bernard is kidnapped, sending Tim on a rescue mission while still trying to understand what he truly desires from life. During the rescue, Bernard tells Robin that his friend Tim helped him come out and understand himself, prompting Robin/Tim to realize his own identity as a bisexual man. Afterward, out of costume, Bernard asks Tim on a date, which Tim accepts. Tim would later tell Bruce (and the rest of the Batman Family off panel) about his breakup with Stephanie and new relationship with Bernard before moving to the Gotham marina on his own. Tim Drake plays a minor role in assisting Batman during Joker War and Fear State event.

In &quot;Tim Drake: Robin&quot;, Tim lives on a house boat while working to forge his own path away from Batman. However, shortly after his move, Tim/Robin gets framed for a crime he didn&#x27;t commit while investigating a series of murders happening to the marina residents. He works with Darcy Thomas/Sparrow (a former initiate in the We Are Robins movement) and Detective Williams to find the real culprit. But this is made more difficult by the appearance of glowing animals and mudlike creatures that take the form of trusted friends and family. Tim ultimately realizes that all these events are linked to a villain obsessed with him, with things coming to a head when Bernard gets kidnapped. Tim confronts the villain, a metahuman who uses the codename Moriarty and who dubs themselves Tim&#x27;s nemesis. Tim defeats Moriarty and saves Bernard, and the couple confirm their commitment to each other.

In the main Batman comics written by Chip Zdarsky, Tim Drake learns the existence of Failsafe (a robot that Zur-En-Arrh created in case Batman killed someone) and meets Zur-En-Arrh for the first time. He tries assisting Batman as well as Zur-En-Arrh (who temporarily took over Batman&#x27;s body), but watches helplessly as Failsafe teleports Batman to a different universe. Tim Drake goes through multiple universes, and finally rescues Batman. He comes into conflict with Batman when Batman starts being aggressive toward his enemies, and fights Damian Wayne. He is temporarily captured by the villains, but escapes and helps Batman save the day. Tim Drake finds Bruce Wayne again after he escapes from his prison, and convinces Bruce to open up and rely on his family again. Tim Drake helps Batman and the Bat-family rescue Damian and defeat Zur-En-Arrh. Bruce Wayne builds a new home for the Bat-family calling it the Pennyworth Manor as a new base after regaining his money.

==Skills and abilities==
Like Batman and other members of the Batman Family, Tim Drake possesses no inherent super-powers and relies on a combination of his combat skills, technology, and deductive abilities; As Robin, Tim Drake underwent training under numerous masters, including Batman, Nightwing, Henri Ducard, Batgirl (Cassandra Cain), and Lady Shiva. 

Over time, the character became adept in the usage of technology and became versed in several expressed styles of martial arts such as Aikido, Karate, Boxing, Judo, Kung Fu, Tai Chi, Krav Maga, and esoteric Tibetian martial styles which include healing arts (which utilize pressure points). In battle, he also favored a bo staff and was trained in its usage by Lady Shiva herself. Over time, Tim&#x27;s skills developed, his intelligence improving to a level where he was able excel in computer science and gain a grasp of assorted scientific techniques, including biology, engineering, and genetics, which he has witnessed his attempts at re-cloning Superboy. As Red Robin, these skills became more advanced and he would be considered an expert martial artist and possess a genius with an IQ of 142, whose forte within the Batman Family includes his intelligence, detective skills, and computer hacking capabilities. His high level of intelligence has also lent him praise from Ra&#x27;s Al Ghul, being one of the few Batman Family members he addressed distinctively as &quot;Detective&quot;. Despite his high level of training and skill in combat, Tim&#x27;s future version from &quot;Titans Tomorrow&quot; stated that he eventually realized he would never possess the same level of skill in combat as Bruce, Dick, Jason, or Damian. In spite of his future versions assertion, Tim was able to overpower and defeat Damian in one on one combat when he stopped holding back against the younger Robin, as well as having been able to hold his own against both Dick and Jason on separate occasions.

Tim is also capable of speaking several languages beyond his native English, including Cantonese, Russian, Spanish and German. Tim is also considered a natural leader, having led teams such as the Teen Titans and Young Justice. As a precaution, Bruce inoculated Tim, as well as his other close allies, against several toxins the Batman family has encountered, including Joker Venom, the Scarecrow&#x27;s fear toxin, and some of Poison Ivy&#x27;s pheromones. While this does not create a full immunity, it does give them a strong resistance, allowing them to continue fighting or escape when exposed to the substances.

==Costumes==

Tim Drake&#x27;s original Robin costume had a red torso, yellow stitching and belt, black boots, green short sleeves, gloves, and pants. He wore a cape made of Kevlar and Nomex that was black on the outside and yellow on the inside. This costume was different from that of his predecessors in that it provided increased protection with an armored tunic and gorget, long boots, an emergency &quot;R&quot; shuriken on his chest in addition to the traditional batarangs and a collapsible bo staff as the character&#x27;s primary weapon.

Following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;52&quot;, Tim Drake modified his costume to favor a mostly red and black color scheme in tribute to his best friend, Superboy (Kon-El), who died fighting Earth-Prime&#x27;s Superboy. This Robin costume had a red torso, long sleeves, and pants, with a cape that was black on the outside and yellow on the inside. It also had yellow stitching and a matching belt, a black domino mask, gloves, and boots.

Tim Drake resumed the motif of a red and black costume when he took on the identity of the Red Robin. The Red Robin costume consisted of a long-sleeved red tunic, along with black boots, tights, gloves, cape, and cowl. It also included a black-and-gold utility belt that carries Drake&#x27;s weaponry, such as his bo staff and throwing discs. After Drake&#x27;s confrontation with Ra&#x27;s al Ghul in &quot;Red Robin&quot; #12, the costume was slightly altered with spiked gauntlets, a cropped tunic, and a new utility belt.

The theme of a red and black costume continued in 2011 with Tim Drake&#x27;s &quot;New 52&quot; Red Robin outfit. The costume was altered considerably, as it was a single-piece red and black costume, with assorted belts on his waist and legs. The full cowl was replaced with a black domino mask, similar to his previous two Robin costume designs. His chest harness was attached to a set of rocket-powered wings, designed by Virgil Hawkins a.k.a. Static, that allow the Red Robin the ability to fly. He continued to use his bo staff and other assorted equipment.

In the 2016 &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; relaunch, Tim Drake maintains the role of the Red Robin. This Red Robin costume serves as a homage to his first Robin costume. His costume is returned to a similar look as his original Robin costume consisting of a red torso, yellow utility belt, black pants, green short sleeves, gloves, and boots. He also has a new cape that is black on the outside and yellow on the inside, similar to the Robin cape. While his Red Robin suit is similar to his first Robin suit, it has two &quot;R&quot;s as his logo instead of one, to show that he is no longer Robin and now the Red Robin. The mask is similar to his &quot;New 52&quot; domino mask. His bo staff remains his primary weapon.

With the revived &quot;Young Justice&quot; series, Tim has returned to the identity of Robin. His new costume shares similarities with his &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; suit; however, it has various adjustments and revisions. His suit still has the red torso, black pants, and armored sleeves; however, his pants now merge into split-toed boots with green highlights, losing the green leg guards. He has replaced the bulkier arm guards with smaller arm guards with blades similar to Damian Wayne&#x27;s Robin suit. His cape, while still black and gold, is now scalloped to look similar to his later OYL cape. Tim&#x27;s double-R logo has been replaced with his original single &quot;R&quot; logo. He continues to use a bo-staff as his primary weapon.

For a brief period in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, Tim adopted the Drake identity, wielding a bo staff and wearing a capeless brown suit with black on the arms and boots and gold accents, before returning to his original Robin costume in &quot;Young Justice&quot; (vol. 3) #19.

==Collected editions==
Tim Drake&#x27;s earliest appearances as Robin were reprinted in trade paperback form shortly after their original publication. However, the ongoing series &quot;Robin&quot; was not regularly reprinted in trade paperbacks until the beginning of Bill Willingham&#x27;s run as a writer with issue #121. The entire series was reprinted from that point onwards, as was its successor ongoing series &quot;Red Robin&quot;. All trade paperbacks from this period have since gone out of print.

Beginning in 2015, DC began publishing new editions of trade paperbacks collecting Robin-centric stories starring Tim Drake. These collections began with the story arcs &quot;Rite of Passage&quot; and &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, and continued onward to include the three &quot;Robin&quot; miniseries and begin collecting the &quot;Robin&quot; ongoing series. Publication of these trade paperbacks stopped after five volumes.

As of 2024, &quot;Robin&quot; (vol.4) #23-120 have never been fully republished in trade paperback, though select issues have been republished in other collections that had multi-series crossover arcs (such as &quot;Robin&quot; (vol.4) #27-30 being collected in the &quot;Batman: Contagion&quot; trade paperback).

Beginning in 2024, a new paperback compendium collecting Chuck Dixon and Alan Grant&#x27;s run as writers, titled &quot;Robin: Tim Drake,&quot; was released, containing previously collected material alongside stories never before included in a Tim Drake story collection.

<doc id="1257771" wikidata="Q1087546" url="?curid=1257771" title="Jason Todd">
<text>Jason Peter Todd is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. First appearing in &quot;Batman&quot; #357 in March 1983, he was created to succeed Dick Grayson as [[Jason Todd|Robin]], Batman&#x27;s partner and sidekick. He initially shared a similar origin to Grayson, being the son of circus acrobats who are killed by criminals in Gotham (Dick&#x27;s were killed by a local mob boss who sabotaged their trapeze while Jason&#x27;s parents were killed by Killer Croc) and adopted by Bruce Wayne, Batman&#x27;s alter ego, as his son and protege. Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; event and the rebooting of DC&#x27;s main comics universe, Jason&#x27;s origin was changed to being a pre-teen street urchin and petty thief who Bruce adopted and mentored after finding the boy attempting to steal the tires off of the Batmobile. This origin has since become the standard for subsequent iterations of the character.

Following Max Allan Collins&#x27;s revamping of Todd&#x27;s origin story in &quot;Batman&quot; #408–411, the character was written by Jim Starlin, who had him become increasingly aggressive and reckless. This led DC Comics to conduct a telephone poll concerning the 1988 storyline &quot;&quot; to determine whether the character should die at the Joker&#x27;s hands. The poll ended with a narrow majority of votes in favor of killing Todd, resulting in his death. Subsequent stories dealt with Batman&#x27;s guilt over failing to save him. The character was resurrected in the 2005 &quot;&quot; story arc, which saw him becoming a murderous villain known as the [[Red Hood]]. In the current New 52/DC Rebirth continuity, Todd is a more nuanced antihero who maintains a tense, albeit partially mended relationship with Batman and has been accepted as a full member of the Batman family. 

Todd has made several appearances as Robin and Red Hood in other forms of media outside of comics, including television series, films, and video games. The 2015 game &quot;&quot; in particular reimagined Todd resurfacing with a new villain identity, the [[Arkham Knight]], after being trapped in Arkham Asylum for years and tortured by The Joker who conditioned him to despise and turn on his former mentor before assuming the Red Hood identity near the end of the game.
==Publication history==
By the time Len Wein took over as editor of DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Batman&quot; titles in 1982, Dick Grayson had largely moved on to starring as the leader of the young superhero team the Teen Titans in DC&#x27;s &quot;New Teen Titans&quot; title. However, with the character no longer featured in &quot;Batman&quot; comics, the disadvantages of telling &quot;Batman&quot; stories without the character to act as a sounding board for the protagonist became apparent. Jason Todd was created to become Dick Grayson&#x27;s replacement as Robin. The character debuted in &quot;Batman&quot; #357 (March 1983) and made his first full appearance in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #525 (April 1983), but it wasn&#x27;t until later that year that he would appear in costume as Robin in &quot;Batman&quot; #366 (December 1983) when he showed up towards the end of the story to help Batman fight the Joker.

Following the 1985 limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, DC took the opportunity to reboot many of its properties. The character was completely revamped. According to Dennis O&#x27;Neil, who took over as Batman editor in 1986, &quot;[The fans] did hate him. I don&#x27;t know if it was fan craziness—maybe they saw him as usurping Dick Grayson&#x27;s position. Some of the mail response indicated that this was at least on some people&#x27;s minds.&quot;

===&quot;A Death in the Family&quot;===

In 1988, Dennis O&#x27;Neil suggested that an audience might be attracted to the comics by being offered the opportunity to influence the creative process. Settling on the idea of the telephone poll via a 1-900 number, O&#x27;Neil had decided due to discussions with DC Comics president Jenette Kahn that the poll should not be wasted on something insignificant. O&#x27;Neil settled on using the poll to determine the fate of the second Robin. O&#x27;Neil said, &quot;The logical candidate was Jason because we had reason to believe that he wasn&#x27;t that popular anyway. It was a big enough stunt that we couldn&#x27;t do it with a minor character.&quot; Even though Jason Todd was unpopular with readers, O&#x27;Neil could not decide what to do with the character, so he opted to present the choice to the readership.

The vote was set up in the four-part story &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; that was published in &quot;Batman&quot; #426–429 in 1988. At the end of &quot;Batman&quot; #427, Jason was beaten by the Joker and left to die in an explosion. The inside back cover of the issue listed two 1–900 numbers that readers could call to vote for the character&#x27;s death or survival. Within the 36 hours allotted for voting, the poll received 10,614 votes. The verdict in favor of the character&#x27;s death won by a slim 72-vote margin of 5,343 votes to 5,271. The following issue, &quot;Batman&quot; #428, was published featuring Todd&#x27;s death. Years later, O&#x27;Neil said hundreds of votes in the &quot;Jason Dies&quot; line might have come from a single person, adding a large degree of uncertainty to the honesty of results regarding a poll designed to determine the character&#x27;s popularity. &quot;I heard it was one guy, who programmed his computer to dial the thumbs down number every ninety seconds for eight hours, who made the difference&quot;, O&#x27;Neil said in a &quot;Newsarama&quot; interview conducted alongside writer Judd Winick during the &quot;Under The Hood&quot; arc.

O&#x27;Neil would later repeat the claim with further specifics: &quot;I heard it was a lawyer who was using a Macintosh and lived in California—I obviously don&#x27;t have hard information on this, but I heard someone out there programmed his computer to dial it every couple of minutes, and since there was only about 65 votes that made the difference if that story is true, that guy, that guy killed Jason Todd!&quot;

Despite the poll results, O&#x27;Neil noted, &quot;We did the deed, and we got a blast of hate mail and a blast of negative commentary in the press.&quot; A few comics creators voiced their displeasure at the event. Writer/artist Frank Miller, who had worked on &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, said, &quot;To me, the whole killing of Robin thing was probably the ugliest thing I&#x27;ve seen in comics, and the most cynical.&quot; However, DC stood behind the outcome of the poll. O&#x27;Neil was quoted on the back cover of &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; trade paperback collecting the story with Todd&#x27;s death as saying, &quot;It would be a really sleazy stunt to bring him back.&quot; O&#x27;Neil would later regret his comment.

There was a degree of discontinuity between the &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; titles with regards to the portrayal of Jason. A lot of adventures occurred post-Crisis which fit with the circus acrobat era and in some cases ran simultaneously in &quot;Detective&quot; as the street kid origin was being laid out in &quot;Batman&quot;. This led to a blackout of almost any Robin appearances in &quot;Detective&quot;. This became especially apparent after his death. Eleven months passed between Jason&#x27;s death in &quot;Batman&quot; #428 and the first mention of his passing in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #606.

In 1989, Denny O&#x27;Neil, Marv Wolfman, and Pat Broderick would introduce Tim Drake as the third Robin. Mindful of the poor reception Jason received from readers, O&#x27;Neil arranged for a more nuanced introduction in which Tim first introduced himself to Dick Grayson and impressed the former Robin with his skills, and was revealed to share a history with Grayson. Batman himself would slowly grow to accept Tim as his new partner, although the memory of Jason would play a heavy part in how Batman trained Tim in the months building up to his official appearance as Robin.

===&quot;Hush&quot; and reintroduction===
Before the release of &quot;Batman&quot; #617 (September 2003), a page of art from the issue by artist Jim Lee circulated on the Internet, apparently revealing the mystery villain Hush, who was the focus of Lee and writer Jeph Loeb&#x27;s &quot;&quot; storyline, as a resurrected Jason. The following month&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; #618 (October 2003) revealed that the appearance of Todd was a ruse by the villain Clayface under the direction of the Riddler and Hush. Loeb explained, &quot;I always liked Jason, liked the idea that Batman had a Robin who died in the line of duty and how that would motivate anyone to continue their quest. It would also be the most recent, most painful thing he had to endure. That&#x27;s why Hush played the card—to get inside Batman&#x27;s head... But &#x27;Hush&#x27; wasn&#x27;t about Jason—Jason was a pawn to be moved around the table... If someone else wanted to tell another Jason story or bring him back and we at least opened the door, that&#x27;s great!&quot;

In 2005, writer Judd Winick began the &quot;Under the Hood&quot; storyline that revolved around the mystery of the identity of the new Red Hood. The character&#x27;s identity was revealed as Jason Todd in &quot;Batman&quot; #638. Winick explained that after his initial arc on the &quot;Batman&quot; title, he suggested doing &quot;something big&quot; to his editors. Specifically, he wanted to bring the character back from the dead. Winick said, &quot;I was less interested in the how and the why and the what of Jason Todd returning from the dead than I am about what Jason&#x27;s return will do to Batman. Now.&quot;

The explanation for the character&#x27;s return was revealed in &quot;Batman&quot; Annual #25 (2006). After a storyline in &quot;Nightwing&quot; as part of the One Year Later event where Todd took the mantle of Nightwing for himself, the character reappeared in his Red Hood persona as one of the focal characters of DC&#x27;s year-long weekly &quot;Countdown&quot; series starting in May 2007.

===&quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot;===
In the &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; follow-up storyline &quot;&quot; (2009), Jason Todd is featured as a gun-wielding vigilante. Commenting on the direction and utilization of Jason Todd in the storyline, writer and artist Tony Daniel has stated that, from this point on, Jason is a &quot;bona fide&quot; villain:

Timothy Drake eventually takes up the bat mantle when Dick Grayson refuses to and sets off to fight Todd, who easily defeats him. Grayson then comes to the rescue and refuses to believe Todd when he claims he has killed Drake (which he had not since current Robin Damian Wayne rescued Drake at the last moment). The two battle and Grayson eventually defeats Todd, who says that he will be seen again.

===The Outlaws===
On June 6, 2011, as part of DC Comics&#x27; line-wide revamp initiative, it was announced that Jason Todd would headline his title in the guise of the Red Hood. Todd acts as leader of the Outlaws, a group of antiheroes that &quot;have several different exciting characters from the DC Universe – some we&#x27;ve seen before and some we haven&#x27;t,&quot; Batman Group Editor Mike Marts said. The group included Roy Harper and Starfire. &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; debuted in September 2011, written by Scott Lobdell and with art by Kenneth Rocafort. The series focused on Jason Todd&#x27;s redemption and introduced a simplified version of his origin story as the Red Hood in &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; #0, a special prequel issue between #12 and #13.

&quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; was later rebooted as part of DC&#x27;s Rebirth event. This series starred a new lineup of Outlaws: Todd, Artemis of Bana-Mighdall and Bizarro, who was touted as a darker counterpart to the Trinity. This lineup lasted for 25 issues, after which Todd briefly reunited with Roy Harper and then went solo. Todd later rescues Bunker and joins forces with a new Wingman to take over Penguin&#x27;s Iceberg Lounge.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;===

The initial version of Jason Todd from before &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; had an origin that was similar to the 1940 origin of the original Robin (Dick Grayson). Originally, he is the son of circus acrobats (Joseph and Trina Todd, killed by a criminal named Killer Croc) and is later adopted by Bruce Wayne. Distinguished by his blond hair, Todd is wearing various pieces of Dick Grayson&#x27;s old childhood disguises as a costume to fight crime until Grayson presents him with a Robin costume of his own. At that point, Todd dyes his hair black, and in later stories blossoms under Batman&#x27;s tutelage.

For a time Natalia Knight, the criminal also known as Nocturna, Mistress of the Night is a stabilizing influence in his life; she becomes his surrogate mother and even adopts the young Todd. Catwoman would be a frequent guest star during this era as she wrestled with the role of hero and as a love interest for Batman which led to clashes with the boy feeling left out.

In the Alan Moore epic &quot;Superman&quot; Annual #11, &quot;For the Man Who Has Everything&quot;, Batman and Todd join Wonder Woman at the Fortress of Solitude to celebrate Superman&#x27;s birthday. They arrive only to find Superman incapacitated by a mysterious creature called the Black Mercy and Mongul there to battle the heroes. Todd as Robin saves Wonder Woman, Superman, and Batman from Mongul by unleashing Mongul&#x27;s hallucination-causing creature on the tyrant himself.

===Post-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;===
====Origin====
Following the revamp due to &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Jason Todd is recast as a young street orphan who first encounters Batman while attempting to steal the tires off the Batmobile in Crime Alley, the very place where Batman&#x27;s parents were murdered years before. The son of Catherine and Willis Todd, Jason lives on the east end of Gotham City in the Park Row district called Crime Alley. Catherine was a drug addict who died of an overdose sometime before he began living on the street. Willis, a former medical student, was working as hired muscle for Two-Face and had disappeared suspiciously following a botched assignment. Bruce Wayne sees to it that Todd is placed in a school for troubled youths, which turns out to be Ma Gunn&#x27;s School for Crime. Jason earns the Robin mantle a short while later by helping Batman apprehend the gang of thieves. However, Todd does not wear the Robin costume until completing six months of training. Batman notes that while Todd does not possess Dick Grayson&#x27;s natural athleticism and acrobatic skills, he can become a productive crimefighter by channeling his rage. He also believes that if he does not help the boy, Todd will eventually become part of the &quot;criminal element&quot;. 

In the revamp period, Todd is portrayed as the &quot;rebel&quot; Robin, reflecting the late 1980s youth culture. He smokes, swears, and fights authority. He is prone to defying Batman&#x27;s orders, sometimes to success (bringing in the Scarecrow singlehandedly) and sometimes to failure (botching a raid on a drug lab by jumping the gun too soon). Todd also aided Batman while Gotham City was temporarily overrun by Deacon Blackfire as shown in &quot;&quot;.

The most controversial moment before his death occurred in &quot;Batman&quot; #424 when serial rapist Felipe Garzonas escapes the prosecution due to his father&#x27;s diplomatic immunity. One of his victims, a girl named Gloria, hangs herself amid the threat of a third rape from Felipe. Todd discovers her hanging and makes a beeline for Felipe, ahead of Batman, who arrived just in time to see Felipe take a 22-story fall to his death, with Todd as Robin at the edge of the balcony. Todd maintains &quot;I guess I spooked him. He slipped.&quot; It is left ambiguous whether Todd killed him. This recalls an earlier exchange in &quot;Batman&quot; #422 where he uses excessive force on a pimp about to slash one of his working girls and Todd asks Batman if it would have been a big loss if he had killed him.

In &quot;Batman&quot; #425, the Dynamic Duo is challenged by Felipe&#x27;s father, who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon in retaliation for his son&#x27;s death. Batman is instructed to meet the kidnappers at a city junkyard and to bring Robin. Batman does not wish to involve Todd and keeps this information from him. However, Robin senses something is wrong and hides in the Batmobile&#x27;s trunk as Batman heads to the junkyard. There, Batman is unable to reach Gordon, surrounded by Garzonas&#x27; men, and Todd intervenes, saving Batman from a close call. Machine gun fire breaks out and Gordon is wounded in the arm. All of the henchmen die, and Garzonas is finally crushed by a pile of junk cars.

====Death====

In 1988&#x27;s &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; storyline, Jason Todd discovers that Catherine Todd was not his biological mother, and runs away to find the woman who gave birth to him. After following several leads, including an Israeli Mossad agent and Shiva Woo-San, Todd finally tracks his biological mother Sheila Haywood to Ethiopia, where she works as an aid worker. While Todd is overjoyed to be reunited with his real mother, he soon discovers that she is being blackmailed by the Joker using her to provide him with medical supplies. Sheila herself has been embezzling from the aid agency and as part of the cover-up, she hands her son, having arrived as Robin, over to Joker. Joker beats the boy brutally with a crowbar and then leaves him and Sheila in the warehouse with a time bomb. Sheila and Jason try desperately to escape the warehouse but the doors are locked as the bomb goes off. Batman arrives too late to save them and finds Jason&#x27;s lifeless body in the rubble. Sheila lives just long enough to tell Batman that Jason died trying to protect her. The bodies are taken back to Gotham City for burial. Todd&#x27;s death continued to haunt Batman afterward, as he considered it his greatest failure. He keeps the second Robin&#x27;s uniform on display in the Batcave as a reminder. The Joker, on the other hand, would occasionally remind Batman of this loss to torment him.

====Return from the grave====
Years later, while trying to discover the identity of a mysterious figure plotting against him, Batman discovers that Tim Drake, Jason&#x27;s successor as Robin, has been kidnapped. He confronts the kidnapper and is stunned to discover that he is an adult Todd, standing at his own desecrated gravesite, and wearing a redesigned and darker version of his Robin costume. Batman subdues this mystery &quot;Jason&quot; and discovers that it is only Clayface impersonating Todd, concluding that &quot;Jason&#x27;s&quot; greater physical age was to hide the flaws in Clayface&#x27;s impersonation by allowing him to partially mimic Nightwing&#x27;s combat skills. However, Todd&#x27;s actual body is missing from its grave.

It is later revealed that Todd had indeed died at the hands of the Joker. However, when Superboy-Prime alters reality from the paradise dimension in which he is trapped—his punches against the barrier keeping him from the rest of the universe causing temporal ripples that create an overlap of parallel timelines (Hypertime)—Jason Todd is restored to life (as he was meant to survive the Joker&#x27;s assaults), breaks out of his coffin, and is eventually hospitalized; because he wandered so far from his grave before his discovery, no connection was ever drawn between the two events. Todd never turns up on any missing person reports—as he was never &#x27;missing&#x27;—nor can he be identified since no prints are on file for him. After spending a year in a coma and subsequently another year as an amnesiac vagrant, he is taken by Talia al Ghul after a small-time crook recognizes him as Robin due to his combat skills on the street.

Talia took Todd in out of her love for Batman, while her father Ra&#x27;s al Ghul was interested in the secret behind his resurrection. The League of Assassins tracked and eliminated everyone in Gotham who knew of Todd&#x27;s resurrection to prevent Batman from finding out. They also interrogated Joker&#x27;s henchmen who were with him during Todd&#x27;s murder, in hopes to find out how the boy could have survived. Talia later restored Todd&#x27;s health and memory by immersing him in a Lazarus Pit in which her father was also bathing and helped him escape the House of al Ghul. It is suggested by Ra&#x27;s that the power of the pit resulted in Todd&#x27;s mental instability. Ra&#x27;s refers to Todd as a &quot;curse&quot; and a &quot;pestilence&quot; unleashed on the planet, saying that madness may affect him for &quot;hours, months, or decades&quot;.

Using the money from Talia and infuriated by her statement that he &quot;remains unavenged&quot;, Todd paid a group of mercenaries to help him return to Gotham. Upon arriving, he enacts a plan to get revenge on Batman, whom he resents for refusing to kill the Joker and thus avenge his death.

====The Lost Days====
Jason Todd creates a false arms trafficking of advanced military arsenal, knowing that Batman would respond. This provides Jason an opportunity to plant a bomb beneath the Batmobile while Batman is on a stakeout for the arms deal. Batman enters the car and is at Jason&#x27;s mercy, detonator in hand. However, Todd realizes that if he went through with it, his former mentor would never know about his return nor the identity of his killer. Todd instead decides to kill Batman directly by traveling across the globe in search of a similar, but the deadlier type of training to Bruce Wayne&#x27;s own to prepare for that day. For years, Todd learns various skills from various masters, assassins, mercenaries, and aviators around the globe, including guns, poisons and antitoxins, martial arts, acrobatics, and bomb-making. Upon learning that the man training him in lethal combat is also the leader of a child sex slave ring, Jason frees the latest shipment of children and takes them to a local embassy, then returns to the training compound and poisons his new mentor for his crimes. Upon being questioned by Talia al Ghul, Todd says it was not murder but rather that he &quot;put down a reptile&quot;. Jason has since repeated the same pattern of killing his teachers when finding them guilty after he has finished with his training.

During his journey, Jason discovers his Robin replacement was Timothy &quot;Tim&quot; Drake, which further torments him. He also learns that the man teaching him bomb-making is involved in a Russian mafia-backed deal meant to push the resources of British law-enforcement away from mob crime and onto Islamic extremist terrorism with a framed bombing plot. Todd manages to hunt down the gang and safely detonate the bombs. Ironically, the only surviving member of the gang offers Jason the possibility of a large government payday in exchange for his life, because he knows where a very wanted man is. That wanted man turns out to be the Joker.

After learning of the Joker&#x27;s arms deal in Los Angeles for another terrorism scheme against Gotham, Jason begins to stalk the villain as a masked gunman. After successfully capturing Joker (who fails to recognize him due to being older), Jason contemplates burning his killer alive after dousing him with gasoline. However, Jason realizes that he does not simply want Joker to die, but desires to punish the villain with Batman. Jason spares Joker and decides to wait for the right opportunity. Jason also admits to Talia that he has already deduced that the reason she finances his training is to stall him from killing Batman, but he has no desire to kill his former mentor anymore. Talia then gives Todd the idea to be the Batman that Gotham needs. She also hires the same carpenters who built Jason&#x27;s casket and had them build a replica of it (the original was destroyed and beyond repair after Jason emerged from it). Todd enters into a pact with Hush and the Riddler. He confirms to Hush that Riddler is correct and that Bruce Wayne is Batman. As Hush, Riddler, and Jason collaborate, Jason initially confronts Batman at his gravesite. Jason then switches places with Clayface to observe Batman from afar. When Batman expresses no remorse for sparing Joker&#x27;s life after the second Robin was killed, Todd is further angered and takes up his murderer&#x27;s original mantle. After she initiated a takeover of Kord Industries for him, Talia gifts Jason the flame dagger (a replica of the one Ra&#x27;s al Ghul often carried) and the red motorcycle-helmet based hood which become his signature weapon and mask.

====Red Hood====

A domino mask is found in the Batmobile. The mask is of the style that Todd wore as Robin, suggesting that he&#x27;d been stalking Batman. Shortly after the events of &quot;&quot; and just before &quot;War Crimes&quot;, Jason Todd reappears in Gotham City as the Red Hood. During the events of &quot;&quot;, he hijacks a shipment of Kryptonite from Black Mask, and in the midst of a battle with Batman, Nightwing and Mr. Freeze, Red Hood gives them the Kryptonite back, and tells them he has gotten what he truly wanted: a &quot;lay of the land&quot;. Shortly afterward, Red Hood finds the Joker (driven out of Gotham by Hush) and beats him with a crowbar just as Joker had beaten Jason. Despite the violence of the beating, Jason spares Joker, intending to use him later against Batman.
Red Hood assumes control over several gangs in Gotham City and starts a one-man war against Black Mask&#x27;s criminal empire, who himself had recently allegedly murdered a Robin (Stephanie Brown). Overall, he strives to take over Gotham&#x27;s gangs, control their activities, and kill Joker in revenge for his death. In his new role as Gotham&#x27;s most powerful crime lord, he repeatedly comes to blows with Batman and several of his allies. After several confrontations, Batman becomes obsessed with the possibility of resurrection from the dead, suspecting that it was Jason he fought, and seeks advice from allies such as Superman and Green Arrow, both of whom have died and returned to life. Around this time, Batman discovers that the empty coffin buried at Jason&#x27;s gravesite is a replica of what he bought. After a series of tests confirmed that it is Jason, Batman continues to keep his Robin costume in its memorial display case in the Batcave regardless; when Alfred Pennyworth asks if he wants the costume removed, Batman sadly replies that the return of Todd &quot;doesn&#x27;t change anything at all&quot; because he wants to remember Jason as the good kid he was when they first met and blames himself over how violent he has become by letting him assume the Robin mantle.

Acting on his obsession with Tim Drake, Todd breaks into Titans Tower to confront the third Robin, thus revealing the truth of their encounter at the cemetery to his successor. Having learned that Tim defeated the Joker by himself in their first fights, Jason seeks to best him in combat. Wearing another version of his Robin costume, Todd quickly immobilizes the other Teen Titans and defeats Drake in the Tower&#x27;s Hall of Fallen Titans, demonstrating that he is now a more formidable fighter than he was before his death. Furious that no memorial statue was made for him (despite his short tenure as a Titan), he demands that Drake tell him if he is as good as Todd has been told. Drake says &quot;Yes&quot; and passes out. As he leaves, he tears the &#x27;R&#x27; emblem from Drake&#x27;s chest, though he later grudgingly acknowledges that Drake is a worthy successor for his courage. Todd is also left wondering if perhaps he would have been a better Robin and better person had he had had a life like Drake&#x27;s and friends like the Titans.

Todd eventually kidnaps and holds Joker hostage, luring Batman to Crime Alley, the site of their first meeting. Despite their now-antagonistic relationship, Batman desperately wants to help Todd and intends to atone for his failures. Todd asks Batman why he has not avenged his death by killing Joker, a psychopath who has murdered countless people and crippled one of their best friends, arguing that Batman should have done it &quot;because he took me away from you&quot;. Batman admits that he has often been tempted by the thought of taking the Joker somewhere private to torture for weeks before finally killing the maniac, but says that he refuses to go to that place. Todd then offers Batman an ultimatum: he will kill Joker unless Batman kills Todd first. Holding Joker at gunpoint, he throws a pistol at Batman and begins to count to three while standing behind Joker, leaving Batman with only a headshot if he wants to stop Todd from pulling the trigger. At the last moment, Batman throws a batarang at Todd, which bounces off a pipe and sinks into his neck causing him to drop his gun. Joker takes advantage of the situation, detonating nearby explosives that engulf the platform and send them plunging into the bay.

====Nightwing====
Jason Todd resurfaces following the &quot;One Year Later&quot; period, patrolling the streets of New York City as a murderous version of Nightwing. However, Jason shows no intention of giving up the Nightwing persona when confronted by Dick Grayson and continues to taunt his predecessor by wearing the costume and suggesting that the two become a crime-fighting team. Not long after the two Nightwings meet up, Todd is captured and imprisoned by local mobsters Barry and Buddy Pierce. Grayson reluctantly rescues him, and the two join forces to defeat the Pierce Brothers. Shortly afterward, Todd leaves New York City and the Nightwing mantle to Grayson, along with a telegram telling Grayson he has returned to normal and still considers himself a gift from Batman.

====Red Hood again====
Jason Todd resumes his persona as the Red Hood and appears in several issues of &quot;Green Arrow&quot; alongside Brick as part of a gun-running organization, which brings Batman to Star City. Jason&#x27;s true motives are shown in the third part as he kidnaps Mia Dearden to dissolve her partnership with Green Arrow, feeling that they are kindred spirits, cast down by society and at odds with their mentors. The two fight while Todd discusses the insanity of heroes for placing child sidekicks in danger. Mia is deeply troubled by the discussion but ultimately decides to remain with Green Arrow.

At the start of &quot;Countdown&quot;, Todd rescues a woman from Duela Dent. After a Monitor shoots and kills Duela, he attempts to kill Jason, but is stopped by a second Monitor. This second Monitor apologizes to Jason before they both disappear, leaving Jason alone with Duela&#x27;s body. Later, at Duela&#x27;s funeral, Jason hides until all of the Teen Titans have left except Donna Troy. Jason tells her what happened the night of Duela&#x27;s death, and about the dueling Monitors. He knows that both he and Donna Troy have come back from the dead, even already deducing that his resurrection has something to do with Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s plans during &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, and wonders which of them is next on the Monitor&#x27;s hit list. The two are then attacked by the Forerunner, but before she can kill them, the apologetic Monitor stops her and recruits Jason and Donna for a mission to the Palmerverse, a section of the Nanoverse discovered by Ray Palmer, in an attempt to find Palmer. During the trip, Jason takes it upon himself to name the Monitor &quot;Bob&quot;. Jason seems to have a romantic interest in Donna and is shown to be visibly disgruntled when her old boyfriend Kyle Rayner joins their group as they take their tour to the 52 Earths which comprise the Multiverse.

====Red Robin====

A teaser image released to promote &quot;Countdown&quot; showed a figure resembling Red Robin among assembled heroes in poses symbolic of their roles in the series. After a series of contradictory statements about this figure, executive editor Dan DiDio firmly stated in the July 2007 DC Nation column that the figure is Jason Todd. The Red Robin costume, originally designed by Alex Ross for the 1996 &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; limited series and worn by the Earth-22 Dick Grayson, is seen in &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; #16 in the Earth-51 Batman&#x27;s base of operations; it is revealed that Earth-51 became the peaceful world it is because the Batman of this Earth killed all the supervillains after his Jason was killed by the Joker. In issue #14, Jason dons the Red Robin suit—described by Earth-51&#x27;s Batman as something he was going to give Todd&#x27;s counterpart when he was older—and goes into battle alongside Earth-51 Batman. During a battle with a group of Monarch&#x27;s soldiers, Earth-51 Batman is killed by the Ultraman of Earth-3, deeply affecting Jason. In his grief, Todd kills an alternate version of the Joker, also involved in Batman&#x27;s killing, who then mocks his loss, vacating alongside Donna, Ray, and Kyle to the planet Apokolips before Earth-51&#x27;s destruction.

After the group is sent back to Earth, Todd leaves the group and returns to his crime-fighting ways. When the Morticoccus virus is released from Karate Kid&#x27;s body, he is forcibly brought back to the group by Kyle, much to his dismay. When the Challengers return to New Earth, Todd disposes of his Red Robin costume and abandons the rest of the group, though they go on to declare to the Monitors that they are now the monitors of the Monitors. Todd and Drake are confronted by another Red Robin in &quot;Robin&quot; (vol. 2) #177, whose identity is initially a mystery but later turns out to be Ulysses Armstrong. Due to a combination of Red Robin&#x27;s involvement and a gun-toting gang member, Todd was shot in the leg and arrested by police. Upon the resolution of the gang war in Gotham, Drake under a pseudonym visited Todd in prison to give him the Justice League access code to release himself from prison. Todd is booked under a pseudonym (John Doe), due to there being no identifiable prints on file for any member of the main bat heroes as well as Jason is still legally dead. Following his escape, Todd continues on the mend and is summoned by Tim Drake to come to the Batcave, where Batman has left a last will statement for him. After hearing the statement in private, Todd prepares to leave, not revealing what he was told, although he does pause before his old costume and the tattered remains of Batman&#x27;s, he is sad.

====Batman====
Jason Todd reappeared in the &quot;&quot; series. Dressed in a version of a Batman costume, Todd is also living/operating out of an abandoned Gotham subway system. His inner monologue reveals that he had always wanted to eventually replace Batman, and thinks it was a bad idea for Batman to become a public figure, rather than an urban legend.

After stabbing Tim Drake in the chest with a Batarang, he and Dick Grayson battle down in the subway. Nightwing still wants to save Todd, but Todd refuses the offer, and instead allows himself to fall off a speeding subway into the Gotham River while stating they would see each other again soon. This allowed Grayson to officially take up the mantle of Batman.

It is later revealed in &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot; that Bruce Wayne&#x27;s last words to Jason were of regret at how he had overlooked the young man&#x27;s deep emotional problems. He thought he could do what could never be done for him and &#x27;make him whole&#x27;. His message goes on to plead that Todd gets psychiatric help, a notion that the latter rejects. It is suggested by Dick Grayson that Todd was infuriated by Wayne&#x27;s last words, a reaction that led him to become a monstrous, murdering Batman in that same arc. Plus, it aggravated his hatred towards the Bat family, as he repeatedly attempts to kill members of it.

====Red Hood and Scarlet====
In the second story arc of &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; by Grant Morrison and Philip Tan, Jason Todd retakes the Red Hood mantle after losing his bid to become the new Batman. To make the very concept of Batman obsolete, he puts a lot of effort into public relations: he drastically alters his Red Hood costume to look more like a traditional superhero outfit and recruits his sidekick Scarlet. In their war on crime, Red Hood and Scarlet freely kill criminals, villains, and anyone who gets in their way, even the police. He leaves behind a calling card that states &quot;let the punishment fit the crime&quot;. He describes his vendetta against Grayson as &quot;the revenge of one crazy man in a mask on another crazy man in a mask&quot;.

Todd has reappeared with red hair, claiming that he is a natural red-head and that Bruce Wayne had him dye his hair black to look like Dick Grayson. He also claims the white streak of hair that he got is from being resurrected in the Lazarus Pit, though the white streak disappears again. In the issue, Todd is characterized as increasingly unstable and his idea of &quot;finishing off&quot; Batman and Robin now consists of stripping them down to their underwear and exposing their identities via webcam activated by a phone poll [a nod by Morrison to his death poll]. A fight between Batman, Robin, and the Flamingo – a foreign hitman hired by a Mexican cartel after Red Hood killed their operative in Gotham – ends with Jason burying Flamingo in debris with a bulldozer. Flamingo is assumed dead, although Commissioner Gordon reports that his body cannot be recovered from beneath the rubble.

Grayson offers to rehabilitate Todd who, in a moment of clarity, tells Grayson it is too late for him, and how he tried to be what Batman wanted, &quot;but this world... this dirty, twisted, cruel and ugly dungheap had... other plans for me&quot;. He then proceeds to fall back into his hero persona, ranting how he did what Batman never did. He &quot;defeated his archenemy&quot;. Todd is arrested by Gordon who informs him that the reason he has always worked with Batman is that Batman never violates the law &quot;where it counts&quot;. As Gordon leads him away, Todd tauntingly asks Grayson why he has not put Wayne&#x27;s corpse into a Lazarus Pit to bring him back, citing his resurrection from its bath. Scarlet flees Gotham, her mask finally falling from her face as she exits the city limits.

Jason files an appeal to be moved from Arkham Asylum where he has been held for observation for the last several months. Bruce Wayne as Batman visits him there to inform Jason he&#x27;s in Arkham for his protection. Jason points out he&#x27;s passed all the psychological tests repeatedly and there is no reason to keep him in what he calls Batman&#x27;s &quot;kennel of freaks&quot;. It is also revealed that, like Tim, Jason was also aware that Batman survived his encounter with Darkseid. Jason is transferred to a Gotham prison and upon his arrival, the suicide rate spikes amongst top incarcerated crime figures there. Several homicides occur due to many botched attempts on Jason&#x27;s life by inmates with a grudge against Red Hood&#x27;s tactics. Jason escalates things further by poisoning the cafeteria, killing 82 and sickening 100 more inmates. He is immediately transferred back to Arkham but is broken out of the paddy wagon by a group of mercenaries. The mercs reveal they are under orders to bring Jason to the person that hired them and that he is in no danger. Jason breaks free and fights them off all the same as Batman and Robin arrive. Once the hired guns are subdued they reveal their employer has captured Scarlet, Jason&#x27;s former sidekick. Dick, Damian, and Jason go to one of the Red Hood&#x27;s weapon caches where he assembles a composite costume made from his biker and &quot;superhero&quot; Red Hood attire. The three intend to rescue Scarlet. After Batman and Robin defeat the mercs, Red Hood rescues Scarlet and escapes using the helicopter. Batman and Robin attempt to chase him, but Red Hood tells them that he planted bombs over Gotham City months ago. Scarlet desires to stay with Red Hood as his partner. Red Hood and Scarlet head towards an unknown destination.

===The New 52===
====Origin====
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Jason&#x27;s new origin is revealed in a special &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; #0 (November 2012) issue, which changes how Batman first met Todd (stealing medicine from Leslie Thompkins, after she had treated him from a brutal beating). The backup introduces a massive retcon in which the Joker is responsible for orchestrating the major moments of Todd&#x27;s life such as his father&#x27;s imprisonment and death, his mother&#x27;s overdose, his introduction to Thompkins, and his adoption of the Robin identity. Considering the Joker is the one narrating this segment, it is open to debate whether he is telling the truth or not. Though only lightly touched on, his resurrection is also simplified: he is resurrected with a Lazarus Pit by Talia al Ghul (as &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; did not occur in this timeline).

====The Outlaws====
Following the events of the &quot;Flashpoint&quot; storyline, the DC universe was relaunched, with Red Hood becoming the leader of the Outlaws in their series, part of the New 52 line of comics. The team also includes Starfire and Roy Harper. Instead of being trained by various men after his return from the dead, Jason Todd was trained by an order of warriors known as the All Caste. He was a part of the order for an unknown amount of time before he was exiled, partly of his own will. After his exile, he became Red Hood and came to be at odds with Dick Grayson, Starfire&#x27;s ex-lover, and his Robin predecessor. He soon tires of Gotham and leaves, gathering the group together; after breaking out Roy from a Middle Eastern prison, he brings Roy up to speed on things. The two start on very friendly terms. Roy and Starfire are in a sexual relationship. However, Starfire makes it clear to Roy that it is only physical, with no emotional ties. Essence, a fellow exiled member of the All Caste whom Jason knows, appears to him but is invisible to others. She sets Jason on a mission to hunt down a group known as &quot;The Untitled&quot;, telling him of people missing organs before death without any sign of removal, which is their calling card. To top it off, Essence shows that the order of the All Caste, the people most qualified to handle the situation, have been slaughtered, leaving her and Jason as the only known survivors. After finding out he&#x27;s no longer the killer he once was, Jason brings his group to the All Caste headquarters, the Hundred Acres of All, where they discover the bodies are returning to life as zombies. Jason is forced to destroy the bodies of his teachers and friends. Afterward, he pays his respects, swearing vengeance for them. He is led on a wild goose chase across the globe. Eventually, he comes across an Untitled, who was in hiding, who tells him that they were set up but still fights him. Jason kills the creature, strengthening his resolve.

Todd has also been revealed to be a member of Batman, Incorporated, initially operating under the name of Wingman, an agent-based in Europe. Wingman temporarily allies himself with Damian Wayne, who is using the name &quot;Redbird&quot; at the time. Batman, Inc is at war with an organization named Leviathan, headed by Talia al Ghul, Damian&#x27;s mother and the woman responsible for reviving Jason, but in the present, she seeks to destroy Batman and has put a bounty on their son&#x27;s head. Alfred Pennyworth refers to Jason as wanting &quot;to be redeemed&quot; through his membership. Later, however, the Wingman ruse is exposed and Todd returns to being Red Hood. While he recalls his days as Wingman as a failure, Bruce Wayne is nevertheless proud of him. Following the events of &quot;Death of the Family&quot;, Bruce and Alfred care for a sick Jason in the Manor, culminating in a warm embrace between Jason and his father figure as he regains consciousness, suggesting that their animosity might finally be put to rest. After Jason recovers and in the wake of Damian&#x27;s death, Batman partners with Jason for the first time since Jason&#x27;s days as Robin. Batman brings Jason on a mission in Ethiopia to punish some of Damian&#x27;s other would-be assassins, and while there he also takes him to the place of his death in the hopes Jason can provide insights into his resurrection so that he might apply the method to Damian. Jason is hurt by Batman&#x27;s manipulation, and the two share harsh words and exchange blows, shattering their newfound relationship. Later, however, the pair come together, united by the ties of family. Jason teams up with Batman, Batgirl, Cyborg and Red Robin to rescue Damian&#x27;s body from Apokolips. They are successful, and Damian is resurrected, sharing a warm reunion with Jason and the family.

Following the traumas of &quot;Death of the Family&quot;, Damian&#x27;s death, and his betrayal by Batman, Jason returns to the All-Caste and has his memories wiped so that he may be at peace. He is &#x27;rescued&#x27; by Starfire and Arsenal, but does not regain his memories. He subsequently learns of his history from Starfire&#x27;s computer, which states Red Hood has made 83 confirmed kills. Jason refuses to believe from Starfire and Arsenal that he had been on a path towards redemption and abandons his teammates.

====Red Hood/Arsenal====
Following the conclusion of the first volume of &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot;, a new series starring Red Hood teaming up with Arsenal as heroes for hire began entitled &quot;Red Hood/Arsenal&quot;. The series eventually ended coinciding with the DC Rebirth event.

===DC Comics Rebirth===
====Red Hood and the Outlaws====

The DC Rebirth introduced the revival of &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; with a second volume released in August 2016. Jason Todd&#x27;s backstory is altered to resemble his post-&quot;Crisis&quot; meeting with Batman occurring while trying to steal tires from the Batmobile. Jason&#x27;s mother is already dead by now and his father is serving a life sentence in prison, so he has been living on the streets. Batman at first tries to help him by enrolling him in Ma Gunn&#x27;s boarding school, trying to give him a home. However, he does not realize that Ma Gunn is using the school as a cover to recruit young delinquents into her criminal gang. When Batman discovers this, he takes down Ma Gunn, with help from Jason.

Batman then takes him in and raises him as the new Robin, though realizes early on that Jason has a violent streak. After Jason is killed by the Joker and resurrected in the Lazarus Pit, he goes on to become the Red Hood, straining his relationship with Batman. The new team consists of Jason Todd as Red Hood, the disgraced Amazon warrior named Artemis, and the Superman clone called Bizarro. This team is referred to as DC&#x27;s &quot;Dark Trinity&quot; in comparison to the new Trinity series included in DC Rebirth which follows Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The team would stay together until &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; (vol. 2) #25-26, where Jason went solo after his team disappeared and the title was changed to Red Hood: Outlaw. He also later appears in Year of the Villain and Event Leviathan #2.

==== Infinite Frontier ====
Jason Todd eventually led his own Suicide Squad which consisted of a zombified Bane, Arkham Knight, Hannah Hobart, Man-Bat, and Mister Bloom until he disbanded them at the series finale. Jason Todd would then help Batman deal with villains taking over Gotham during City of Bane, Joker War, and Fear State. Jason Todd helped console Roy Harper during Beast Boy&#x27;s injury against Deathstroke during Dark Crisis and was affected by Insomnia&#x27;s spell during Knight Terrors. He woke up from Insomnia&#x27;s spell with help from Tim Drake and initially sided with Catwoman during Gotham War, but that led to a confrontation against Batman. Batman captured and used an altered version of Scarecrow&#x27;s toxins on Jason Todd to force him to stop being a hero. Todd fought off the mind control and saved the day, but as a result, his relationship with Batman became strained. 

==Powers and abilities==
During his time as Robin, Jason did not possess any inherent super-powers and instead relied on his natural abilities, skills, and technology, similar to his mentor Bruce Wayne. During his time as Robin, Jason was initially considered a first-class athlete and a capable hand-to-hand combatant, although his detective and reasoning skills were considered to be relatively weak. Over time, Jason developed his skills, becoming adept in various forms of martial arts and eventually developed keen detective skills. Jason was also taught by Batman in the use of firearms in training comparable to law enforcement agencies&#x27; requirements such as police departments or the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as required for crime fighting and forensics, despite not using this skill typically when he was Robin.

After the character&#x27;s resurrection, Jason&#x27;s skills became more advanced and received more training (details depending on continuity); in modern stories, his training has included the mystical All-Caste order and the League of Assassins, having learned under premier instructors in the latter such as Bronze Tiger and Lady Shiva. In addition to his prior skills (such as being a skilled gymnast and skilled detective), Jason is also considered an expert marksman with various firearms. To hone this ability, he went a step further than Batman on his journey around the world to learn from masters how to kill a target with different types of guns, possess considerable &quot;street smarts&quot;, and is remarked to be a natural leader. Following his resurrection and training, Jason now possesses some magical powers. He is able to summon and use the mystical weapons known as the All-Blades, which are weapons manifested from Jason&#x27;s soul that allow him to fight mystical threats. Jason can also negate certain magical attacks using techniques taught to him by Talia al Ghul. 

During his time with the All-Caste, Jason also developed an immunity to paralytic toxins and learned how to see the past, present, and future all at once. 
=== Equipment ===
For a time, through Talia al Ghul&#x27;s access to Kord Industries, as well as being LexCorp&#x27;s former CEO, Jason had access to high-level weaponry and advanced computer equipment and gadgetry. However, his dagger remains his preferred weapon of choice for hand-to-hand combat; it can cut through Batman&#x27;s armor and arsenal. Having been trained in the use of Batman&#x27;s batarangs in perfect aim, he has some lethally sharpened shurikens similar to his dagger that based on his former mentor&#x27;s designs as throwing weapons. His weapons of choice are a pair of customized IWI Jericho 941s, fitted with extra Picatinny rails and mini red-dot sights.

After training with the All-Caste, Jason received the All-Blades which are capable of slaying magical foes but are harmless against mundane enemies. The blades magically appear in Jason&#x27;s hands when needed.

<text>Leonora is a town in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia, located northeast of the state capital, Perth, and north of the city of Kalgoorlie.

==History==

The first European explorer to visit the area was John Forrest in 1869. On 21 June 1869 Forrest&#x27;s party made camp near a conspicuous hill, which Forrest named Mount Leonora, after his six-year-old niece Frances (Fanny) Leonora Hardey. In 1895, gold was discovered in the area by prospector Edward &quot;Doodah&quot; Sullivan at the Johannesburg lease just north of the current townsite. In the following two years a number of rich finds resulted in rapid development of the area. The Sons of Gwalia gold mine brought Leonora to the attention of the world. By 1897 a residential and business area had been established, and the town was gazetted as Leonora.

Leonora is the terminus of the Kalgoorlie to Leonora railway line, which opened in 1903.

Leonora had a single track passenger tramway linking the town and nearby Gwalia, from 1901 to 1921. Initially steam driven, the service was electric from November 1908, and petrol powered from 1915.

A reverse osmosis desalination treatment plant was opened in October 2005 to improve the quality of the town&#x27;s water supply from the Station Creek wellfield by reducing the naturally occurring high levels of salinity, nitrate and hardness. It was designed to supply of treated water per day.
In 2010, the Rudd government relocated asylum seekers from Christmas Island to the &quot;Leonora Alternative Place of Detention&quot;, an immigration detention centre, previously used as a mine workers hostel, in Leonora. The Abbott government closed the facility in February 2014.

==Economy==
Leonora is primarily a mining town. There are a number of major gold mines in the shire, as well as the Murrin Murrin laterite nickel project. The area supports a significant pastoral industry.

==Demographics==
At the 2016 census, Leonora had a population of 556, 27.6% of whom were of Aboriginal descent. It is thought to be the largest settlement in between the 20th and 30th parallels south and the 120th and 130th meridians east.

==Climate==
The area has an arid climate (&quot;BWh&quot;), with very hot summers and cool winters. Frost may occur occasionally on some winter mornings. Rainfall is very sparse.

<doc id="1257784" wikidata="Q302550" url="?curid=1257784" title="Kyle Rayner">
<text>Kyle Rayner (), one of the characters known as [[Green Lantern]], is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character is depicted as being associated with the Green Lantern Corps, an extraterrestrial police force of which he has been a member.

Rayner has been adapted into various media outside comics, including animated series and video games. He has been voiced by Michael P. Greco, Will Friedle, Josh Keaton, and John Rubinow.

==Publication history==
Created by writer Ron Marz and artist Darryl Banks, and named after a character from James Cameron&#x27;s film &quot;The Terminator&quot;, Kyle Rayner first appeared in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; vol. 3, #48 (1994), as part of the &quot;Emerald Twilight&quot; storyline, in which DC Comics replaced Green Lantern Hal Jordan with Kyle, who was the sole Green Lantern throughout the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s in a very successful run that rejuvenated the Green Lantern franchise. He served as a member of the JLA where he was one of the brightest stars. During the later end of this period he was also briefly known as Ion.

Following Jordan&#x27;s return to Green Lantern status in the 2004–2005 limited series &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot;, and the 2005 crossover storyline &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Kyle returned to his alias of Ion. After the events of the &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot;, Kyle returned to his original role as a Green Lantern officer, along with a promotion to Honor Guard Illustres of the Corps. Later on, he becomes a White Lantern following the mastery of all seven lantern rings. After DC Rebirth, Kyle again returns as Green Lantern, along with his original Corps uniform.

==Fictional character biography==
===The last Green Lantern===
Before he acquired a Green Lantern power ring, Kyle Rayner was a struggling-but-gifted freelance comic book artist who was raised in North Hollywood and lived and worked in Los Angeles. Kyle was raised by his Irish mother as an only child; his father abandoned his mother when she was pregnant. It was later revealed that his father was a Mexican-American CIA agent named Gabriel Vasquez and that Aaron Rayner was merely an alias and that he had once met Hal Jordan shortly after the pilot became Green Lantern. Kyle and his mother lived a modest lifestyle until he reached adulthood. After Jordan, grief-stricken over the destruction of his home of Coast City, went on a mad rampage killing various members of the Green Lantern Corps and Guardians of the Universe, Ganthet gave Kyle the last working Green Lantern power ring. His reasons for doing so have never been made completely apparent, aside from Rayner having been in the right place at the right time: prior to bequeathing the ring, Ganthet simply utters, &quot;You will have to do.&quot; Ganthet later revealed that humans make great Green Lanterns (before Hal Jordan&#x27;s mental breakdown he was the Corps&#x27; greatest Green Lantern, and John Stewart became the first mortal Guardian of the Universe). Several sources, however, imply that Ganthet was following a deeper reason: Kyle Rayner was not chosen because he was fearless but because he was able to feel and overcome fear, thus making him, and all the future Lanterns, less susceptible to Parallax&#x27;s influence. The &quot;New Guardians&quot; retelling goes so far as to replace the scowling &quot;You will have to do&quot; with a smiling &quot;It would seem I chose well.&quot;

At first, Kyle took possession of the ring very lightly. His girlfriend, Alexandra DeWitt, encouraged him to be more responsible, create his own version of the Green Lantern uniform, and helped him train for his new role as a superhero, but she was later murdered and stuffed in a refrigerator by the supervillain Major Force. The guilt over this event drove Rayner to take his role more seriously, and as a result, he strove to be the best Green Lantern he could be in honor of Alex&#x27;s memory. Rayner then moved to New York City, since Los Angeles reminded him of Alex and he needed a fresh start.

Rayner grew up enamored with Superman and Batman, though he had only a passing knowledge of Earth&#x27;s various Green Lanterns. This soon changed, and he found that the Green Lantern ring was the ultimate expression of his fertile imagination. While in battle, he often used the ring&#x27;s power to create constructs of just about anything his artistic mind could imagine: other superheroes, anime characters, mystical characters, mechas, futuristic weapons, and original characters from his comic books. While other members of the Green Lantern Corps questioned the practicality of those constructs, they often made Rayner an unpredictable and formidable opponent.

===Justice League===
After relocating to New York City, Rayner joined the superhero group the Titans for a brief time, during which he dated Donna Troy, but eventually became a member of the Justice League (JLA). He initially clashed with the Flash (Wally West) early in his career. West had worked with Jordan since childhood and had reservations about Kyle as the new Green Lantern, but he eventually became one of Rayner&#x27;s best friends and biggest supporters. Surprisingly, another of Kyle&#x27;s biggest supporters amongst the League was Batman, who often treated him with more respect than he showed certain other League members (including his predecessors as Green Lantern—Jordan, Gardner, and Stewart), most likely due to the fact that Kyle was willing to learn from others where other Lanterns focused on their rings and pre-existing skills, even had trained by Batman in combats. Rayner also entered a romantic relationship with Jade and formed friendships with the Golden Age Green Lantern (Jade&#x27;s father, Alan Scott), Green Arrow (Connor Hawke), Arsenal (Roy Harper), Warrior (Guy Gardner), and John Stewart (who at the time was a former Green Lantern).

During his superhero career, Rayner accumulated a rogues gallery that included characters from his predecessors&#x27; pasts such as Dr. Polaris and Dr. Light.

===Oblivion===
During the Fifth-week event &quot;Circle of Fire&quot;, it is discovered that a cosmic entity named Oblivion is coming to Earth after he attacked the planet Rann. This shocked Rayner because the villain is strikingly identical to the character of a story Rayner made when he was seven during his period of struggling with his fear and anger of growing up without a father, as a nemesis to the adventurer the Cannoneer. The Justice League tries to stop Oblivion, and during the battle, Kyle is sent back to Earth to get reinforcements, but the League is captured. On Earth, Kyle recruits Power Girl, the Atom, Firestorm, Adam Strange, and the Circle of Fire — a group of Green Lanterns from alternate realities and different time periods. The Circle of Fire consists of Rayner&#x27;s late girlfriend Alexandra DeWitt from an alternate timeline (where she had received the power ring instead of Rayner); Hunter and Forest Rayner, cousins descended from Rayner who share one power ring; Ali Rayner-West, Green Lightning, a future descendant of Wally West and Kyle Rayner who possesses both the Flash and Green Lantern&#x27;s powers but could only use one of those powers at a time; a reprogrammed Manhunter robot model G.L.7177.6; and Pel Tavin, the Emerald Knight, a Daxamite Green Lantern from the Middle Ages.

Finding himself in a role as a leader, Rayner split this group up to handle different crises caused by Oblivion, or in some cases to search for a way to defeat him. Eventually, in a confrontation, Oblivion reveals that he is a distillation of Rayner&#x27;s doubts and darker impulses, made manifest through the power of the ring. The villain also reveals that Rayner has subconsciously created the Circle of Fire based on his positive aspects because he needed help; Alex is an embodiment of Rayner&#x27;s capability for love, while Tavin represents his bravery, Ali represents hope, G.L.7177.6 represents logic, and Hunter and Forest represent his imagination. When they realize this, they decide that the created Green Lanterns should return to Rayner&#x27;s mind. Doing so allows him to unlock more powers from the ring that had been previously unavailable to him and also discovers an inner strength he never knew he possesses after his positive aspects return to him. Facing up to this, Rayner is able to defeat Oblivion in New York City, imprison the entity within his own mind, and free the Justice League.

===Ion===

For a brief period, Rayner achieved godhood as Ion after absorbing the energy Hal Jordan had left in Earth&#x27;s Sun during &quot;The Final Night&quot; storyline, which had merged and grown with energies released after Oblivion&#x27;s defeat. With his new powers, Rayner could bend time, space, and reality, allowing himself, for a good example, to be in many places at once. The drawback of being one with everything was that Rayner could no longer sleep or separate himself from the overwhelming responsibilities these abilities imposed upon him. Rather than sacrifice his humanity, Rayner abandoned omnipotence, bleeding off the vast power, recharging the Central Power Battery on the Guardians&#x27; home planet and headquarters, Oa, and helping to create a new group of Guardians in the process. Before he purged all of the power, though, he modified his ring and conjured a new Corps uniform to reflect his new maturity. Once again limited only by his willpower and imagination, Rayner&#x27;s ring could still affect yellow and would always harbor a lifeline of power without a time limit on its power, is keyed directly to him, and would always return to him, though it still required charging to reach full power.

After the brutal gay bashing of his young assistant and friend Terry Berg, Rayner went on a lengthy self-imposed exile into space. Before leaving, he placed John Stewart, recently recovered from his paraplegia and given a new power ring, into his spot in the Justice League. Upon his return, he discovered that Jade had begun seeing someone new and was doing so in his own apartment. He left New York and spent some time trying once again to find his place on Earth and ended up staying with his mother for a brief time.

===Green Lantern: Rebirth===

After being tricked into believing his mother had been murdered by Major Force, Rayner fights with the villain, eventually dealing with the immortal by decapitating him and shooting his head into space. Feeling that he is a danger to those he cares for, Rayner once again leaves for the far reaches of space. During the events of the miniseries &quot;Green Lantern: Rebirth&quot;, he returns with Jordan&#x27;s corpse and the discovery of the true nature of Parallax, which is revealed to actually be an alien parasitic entity, the non-corporeal embodiment of fear, that possessed Jordan and committed crimes in his name. Subsequent to this, Rayner is given special status amongst the Guardians, who consider him the &quot;Torch-Bearer&quot;, the Green Lantern who carried the legacy through the Corps&#x27; darkest period.

===Infinite Crisis and the return of Ion===
In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Alexander Luthor reveals that had the Multiverse continued to exist without &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; occurring, Rayner would have been a native of Earth-Eight. When Jade dies during the Infinite Crisis Rann/Thanagar War Special, she transfers her power to Rayner, catalyzing his transformation into Ion.

In the series &quot;Ion: Guardian of the Universe&quot;, Ion seemingly destroys a fleet of starships and violently attacks two Green Lanterns, but Kyle has no memory of the destruction and only learns of his possible role in it after being attacked by a bounty hunter. Upon visiting the fleet&#x27;s wreckage, Kyle loses control and finds himself near the sentient planet Mogo, also a Green Lantern, who uses his Lantern abilities to help convalescing Lanterns gain insight into their problems through the use of constructs conjured by the Lantern&#x27;s own subconscious. On Mogo, Rayner converses with images of Alex, Donna, and Jade and fights Major Force. Rayner realizes that as Ion, he is able to channel the green energy of both the Starheart and the Central Power Battery. This new energy is called the &quot;Ion Power&quot;.

Later, Jordan finds Ion destroying a planet but discovers that this is in fact Alexander Nero, who claims that his connection with Kyle and new powers are the result of a third party&#x27;s interference. Jordan and Rayner then discover that the Guardians had placed Rayner through these events as a test of whether he could handle his power, in anticipation of their granting him an honored position among Green Lanterns as their Torchbearer, now that he harbors the ability to revive the Corps should it ever be destroyed again. They explain that he will not patrol a sector as other Lanterns do but will be called upon for aid in situations that the Corps cannot handle alone. They also reveal that some unforeseen enemy manipulated Nero, who unleashes a massive amount of energy that Kyle dissipates into what is presumed to be a pocket universe. Rayner later learns that he was hunted by enemies such as Effigy, who was subliminally instructed to attack Rayner by Nero. After clearing his reputation on the planet that was scorched by Nero while using Rayner&#x27;s identity, Rayner learns his mother is dying of an unknown cause. After being attacked by the Tangent Comics version of the Atom and the Flash, and being transported to the interdimensional realm known as the &quot;Bleed&quot;, where he encounters Captain Atom, he returns home to attempt to reanimate his now-dead mother&#x27;s corpse with newly acquired powers, but after a tearful farewell, she declines resurrection, asking Rayner to allow her to die, a request that the grief-stricken Rayner grants.

===Sinestro Corps War===
Sinestro abducts Rayner from Oa through one of his new yellow power rings. At the Sinestro Corps&#x27; base on Qward, he reveals to Kyle that he was responsible for his mother&#x27;s death and infected her with the sentient virus Despotellis to kill her in a plot to break Rayner&#x27;s will so that he could serve as Parallax&#x27;s new host. Sinestro also reveals that Ion is actually a benevolent energy entity, similar to Parallax, that thrives on willpower and that Rayner was unknowingly its current host.

The Sinestro Corps confront Kyle, who has his powers drained out of him by Sinestro himself and is immediately taken over by Parallax. Parallax then clothes itself in a new uniform, which appears as a combination of the Sinestro Corps&#x27; uniform, Kyle&#x27;s original Green Lantern costume, and the armor Hal Jordan wore as Parallax. Parallax&#x27;s possession also turns the hair on top of Kyle&#x27;s head gray, just as it turned the hair on Hal Jordan&#x27;s temples. Parallax returns to Qward with the Sinestro Corps and is inducted into their ranks, becoming one of the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s heralds.

In Kyle&#x27;s body, Parallax captured Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, and John Stewart and brought them to Qward. Before bringing them, Parallax made Hal relive the only time he ever experienced fear: when his father died. Parallax also elaborated that since invading Kyle&#x27;s mind, he now has nearly infinite creativity to call upon in his deeds. During the battle with the Green Lantern Corps, who arrive at Qward to rescue the captured Lanterns, Parallax murders Jack T. Chance and crushes his Power Ring before it can find a replacement. During his fight with the Earth Green Lanterns, Parallax revealed that Kyle Rayner&#x27;s &quot;twisted desire&quot; was to be the last Green Lantern again and thus &quot;special&quot;. He is stopped from murdering Guy Gardner by the intervention of the surviving Lost Lanterns and the Ion entity. The Embodiment of Fear then led an advance group of the Sinestro Corps, readying to attack Coast City. It is also suggested by the Guardians of the Universe that Kyle is no longer destined to be Ion following his being taken over by Parallax.

As seen in the one-shot &quot;Parallax&quot; (September 2007) Kyle was trapped within his own mind. He is able to witness all that Parallax says and does from a third-person perspective but is unable to stop it. Kyle&#x27;s personality watches Parallax&#x27;s actions from inside the prison that his own imagination has constructed: his mother&#x27;s empty house. The only fixture in the house is an old painting of uncertain origin and authorship that had belonged to Kyle&#x27;s mother. As Kyle watches Parallax battle Hal Jordan and the Lost Lanterns a manifestation of the fear entity comes to pay him a visit. In the realm of his imagination, Kyle is able to &quot;transform&quot; into Ion and engage the parasite in battle. After being blasted back by Parallax and losing his Ion form, Kyle forms a power ring, places it on his finger, and appears in his original costume. Although he puts up a valiant fight, Parallax is too much for him, and Kyle is defeated. Parallax taunts Kyle with his deepest fear: failing the people who depend on him, especially the women in his life. Many of the women in Kyle&#x27;s life have died or come to harm because of their association with him, and this causes Kyle to struggle with feelings of guilt and responsibility. The latest to die was Kyle&#x27;s mother, killed by the sentient virus Despotellis on the orders of Sinestro. It was the grief and guilt that this revelation caused Kyle that allowed the Parallax entity to possess him. Sneering, Parallax mocks Kyle&#x27;s helplessness and turns to depart, but the enraged artist grabs a pencil and stabs the creature in the eye with it. Parallax, unfazed and unhurt, taunts Kyle once more with the hopelessness of his position and disappears. Left alone, Kyle is about to smash the painting in frustration when he notices his mother&#x27;s signature in the bottom corner and realizes that she secretly painted it years ago. This deep and unexpected connection with his mother gives Kyle hope, the very thing he most needs to overcome his fear. With renewed faith in himself, Kyle walks into the painting and ends up in a field walking toward a bright, green star.

===Green Lantern again===
After threatening Hal&#x27;s brother and family in Coast City, Parallax is confronted by Hal Jordan, who is enraged by the entity&#x27;s attempt to take James Jordan&#x27;s life as well as possession of Kyle. Surprisingly, Jordan actually manages to beat Parallax consistently in fury but loses the charge in his ring before he&#x27;s able to defeat him completely. While visibly weakened, Jordan becomes absorbed by Parallax in addition to Rayner, and Parallax takes a new physical form with a bright yellow costume, a sign that he is a creature capable of inducing great fear.

Meanwhile, fellow Lantern John Stewart orders Honor Guard Lantern Guy Gardner to retrieve the painting (Kyle had discussed the painting in the &quot;Sinestro Corps Special&quot;, as well as the &quot;Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Parallax&quot; one-shot) of a little boy in a field, which was hanging in Kyle&#x27;s dead mother&#x27;s house. As Guy returns and shows the painting to Parallax, it visibly shifts his demeanor. Jordan, the beacon of green light that had come to Kyle inside his mind, assists Rayner in fighting Parallax exhaustively until they finally break free from the fear embodiment&#x27;s grip.

Just as the now-separated Parallax creature counterattacks the Lanterns, ousted Guardians Ganthet and Sayd arrive with four Lantern Power Batteries, and they proceed to entrap Parallax within them all. Ganthet explains that his final act as a Guardian is to give Rayner his power ring. The Guardian asks Rayner if he is willing to downgrade himself to a regulation Green Lantern after serving as host to Ion for so long. Kyle quickly agrees, and the four officers then take their batteries, recite the oath, and recharge their rings.

The four Green Lanterns then split in two directions; Hal returns to Coast City to prevent it from being destroyed again with Kyle by his side, and John and Guy head to New York City to battle the Anti-Monitor, Superboy-Prime, and Cyborg Superman. As Hal and Kyle battle Sinestro, Sinestro momentarily gains the upper hand after one of the Manhunters absorbs their power ring&#x27;s energies. After the Green Lantern Corps defeat the Cyborg Superman, the Manhunters immediately deactivate, with Hal able to take one of the robots&#x27; skulls to absorb Sinestro&#x27;s power. With three of them powerless, Hal and Kyle immediately engage Sinestro in combat, with the two Lanterns emerging as the victors against the despotic Korugarian.

After the war, he is assigned to the Honor Guard as Guy Gardner&#x27;s partner and sent to counsel Sodam Yat, the new Ion. Kyle and Guy decide to move to Oa, giving them better access to performing their duties. Kyle places his mother&#x27;s painting on the wall of his new Oan apartment. The Ion is now stated as unrelated to the Starheart Power given to him by Jade: Such sudden spike in powers enabled the Guardians to temporarily bond the Ion entity with Kyle. With the loss of the Ion entity, Rayner again has the powers and abilities of a standard Green Lantern. 

Since his promotion to Honor Guard, Rayner has acted as a troubleshooter for the Corps, participating in actions such as the defeat of Sinestro Corps member Mongul and the capture of Sinestro Corps member Krybb. Following this, Rayner and Lantern Soranik Natu began a romantic relationship.

===Countdown and beyond===
In &quot;Countdown&quot;, Weeks 49-47, Kyle Rayner is among those &quot;anomalies&quot; listed by the Monitors as being dangerous to the Universe, so he is on their list for termination. Also on the list are Duela Dent, Donna Troy, and Jason Todd.

Rayner briefly appears in &quot;All-New Atom&quot; #15, once again carrying a Green Lantern ring (through his narration, Rayner makes it clear that he is no longer Ion, stating that he &quot;[has] to change [his] business cards&quot;). He now joins Donna Troy, Jason Todd, Bob the Monitor, and the Jokester in the &quot;Countdown Presents the Search for Ray Palmer&quot;. This story takes place after the events of the &quot;Sinestro Corps War&quot;, though it was started while the war was still ongoing in the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and &quot;Green Lantern Corps&quot; series. Rayner&#x27;s new uniform is an amalgamation of his previous Lantern uniforms and elements of the traditional version, as well as his original mask.

When the challengers finally locate Ray Palmer (on Earth-51) Bob attacks him, revealing his acts of assistance to be a ruse. Kyle escapes with Ray, who reveals that it was the deceased Earth-51 Ray Palmer who was meant to stop the great disaster, not him. The two are then attacked by Power Ring and evil versions of Booster Gold and Supergirl. While the battle between Monarch and Superboy-Prime rages, the hand of the Source urges the Challengers to go to Apokolips. With the help of Earth-51&#x27;s Monitor, Nix Uotan, the group manages to leave before Superboy-Prime tears open Monarch&#x27;s armor, obliterating that entire universe.

After Darkseid&#x27;s defeat, Rayner joins Donna, Ray, and Forager in becoming border guards to the Multiverse.

===Blackest Night===

Continuing his duties as a Green Lantern Honor Guard member, Rayner moved to Oa, running a new version of the Warriors Bar with Guy Gardner and continuing his relationship with Soranik Natu, secretly breaking one of the ten new laws in the book of Oa unveiled by the Guardians: No relationships between Green Lanterns. He had been involved in the lead-up to &quot;The Blackest Night&quot;, being one of the first to deal with a new Star Sapphires member, and fought on Oa after the Guardian Scar caused a mass prison break of Sinestro Corpsmen.

After the prison break, the Alpha Lanterns were ordered by the Guardians to execute all Sinestro Corps members and all other prisoners. Rayner and Guy opposed this, cautioning the Alphas and the Guardians to avoid the dark path to which such actions would lead, but the Guardians ignored this, reassigning Rayner and Guy to Earth for their opposition to their decree. After briefly returning to Earth, the two Lanterns returned to Oa, encountering an immense swarm of black rings, which reanimated all the deceased Lanterns in Oa&#x27;s crypts, bringing Kyle face to face with the reanimated corpse of Jade. Having learned that these Black Lanterns are not truly the deceased persons they once were but grotesque mockeries, Rayner tries to destroy them, but the false Jade torments Rayner with images of people he has failed in the past. The false Jade is destroyed by Natu.

During the Black Lanterns&#x27; attack upon the Central Power Battery on Oa, Alpha Lantern Chaselon&#x27;s internal power battery was breached. Anticipating its detonation, and after professing his love for Natu, Kyle sacrificed himself by grabbing it and using it to destroy as many Black Lanterns as he could. Black rings attempt to resurrect Rayner as a Black Lantern, but they are destroyed by the Corps, Munk of the Indigo Tribe, and Miri Riam of the Star Sapphires, whose power embodies love. Having sensed the love between Kyle and Soranik in jeopardy, she uses her power to connect Kyle&#x27;s heart to Natu&#x27;s and restores Rayner to life. Journeying to Earth, Rayner battles a Black Lantern version of Alexandra DeWitt, where he helps defeat the Black Lantern Corps leader, Nekron. In the aftermath, some of the Black Lanterns are restored to life, including Jade.

===War of the Green Lanterns===

When the rogue Guardian Krona attacks Oa, he places Parallax back inside the Central Power Battery, enabling him to control the Green Lanterns through fear. Due to his past experiences with Parallax, Kyle is able to resist the effects but is forced to remove his ring to prevent himself from losing control. Tasked by Ganthet to flee, Kyle and John Stewart make their way into Oa&#x27;s underground. While there, they encounter Guy and Hal, who has the rings of the other Corps leaders. Kyle, taking Ganthet&#x27;s earlier declaration that he was putting his &quot;hopes&quot; in him to heart, chooses Saint Walker&#x27;s ring, while Hal chooses Sinestro&#x27;s, Guy chooses Atrocitus&#x27;s, and John chooses Indigo-1&#x27;s. However, the blue ring has the effect of supercharging the attacking Green Lanterns&#x27; rings, severely impeding the Earthmen&#x27;s defense. While Hal and Guy go to remove Parallax from the Central Power Battery, Kyle and John attempt to free Mogo from Krona&#x27;s control. On the way, Kyle discovers the blue ring&#x27;s ability to show a person their greatest hope can free the Lanterns from Krona&#x27;s control. Unfortunately, it does not work on Mogo, due to the residual Black Lantern energy in his core. Kyle can only watch in horror as John absorbs the Black Lantern energy, along with all the Green Lantern energy, and uses it to destroy Mogo. In the fallout, the two regroup with Hal, Guy, and Ganthet, using the full power of the emotional spectrum to crack open the Battery and release Parallax. Their job done, the Lanterns regain their original green rings, in preparation for the final confrontation with Krona. In the final battle, Hal takes Kyle to the Book of the Black and makes him draw a picture of Sinestro, Carol Ferris, and the others Lanterns trapped in the Book, which effectively frees them from their prison.

In the aftermath of the war, Kyle and Soranik are forced to deal with their relationship issues. Kyle talks with Tomar-Tu about his problems with Soranik, but they, along with Soranik, are teleported into an alien world ravaged by Star Sapphire Miri Riam. The Lanterns subdue Miri, who reveals to them that she did not kill anyone on the planet and she only damaged property to force Kyle and Soranik to reunite and solve their problems, reminding them of the time when she used her crystal to reveal to them their respective true loves. However, Kyle reveals that when Miri showed him his true love, he saw Jade, not Soranik. He justified himself saying that although Jade was the love of his life, she was dead and he needed to move on. Angered, Soranik breaks up with Kyle, telling him not to enter her sector.

===The New 52===

After the &quot;War of the Green Lanterns&quot;, Kyle resumes his functions on Earth, using his signature creative constructs to save construction workers caught in a construction accident. Elsewhere in the universe, yellow, red, violet, and indigo power ring bearers are decommissioned, and their rings set out for Sector 2814 (Earth). After saving the construction workers, the four rings approach Kyle, each claiming him as their new bearer. Confused by the appearance of the rings, Kyle is soon ambushed by the decommissioned bearers&#x27; peers (consisting of Arkillo, Bleez, Fatality, and Munk), who have tracked the rings to Kyle and have come to retrieve them.

As Kyle fights the four lanterns, a blue ring appears, claiming Kyle as its bearer. Soon afterward, Saint Walker appears, having tracked the ring&#x27;s trajectory, and helps Kyle reach Oa to try to understand what is happening. On their way an orange ring reaches Kyle, with Saint Walker claiming if the orange ring had come to Kyle, and since only one orange ring exists, it means that its former bearer must be dead. On Oa, Kyle tries to talk to Ganthet, only to discover that the Guardians have removed all emotion from him, and Ganthet now acts just like all the other Guardians of the Universe. When the Guardians try to capture Kyle and forcibly discover what turned the Green Lantern into a magnet for the different Corps&#x27; rings, the six rings impose themselves on Kyle, turning him into the first entity to bear all seven Lantern Corps&#x27; rings. Despite some initial success, Kyle&#x27;s body is eventually unable to keep up the strain of wielding all of his new rings, with five of the new rings destroyed after a few moments, leaving just the orange ring along with his green ring. Ganthet attempts to remove Kyle&#x27;s green ring and dismiss him from the Corps, but the ring itself reacts violently to this attempt to remove it. The orange ring is revealed to be a construct of Glomulus, who asks Kyle for help, with the other ring-bearers arriving to either assist or attack Kyle. When the Guardians forcefully strike down the lanterns save for Glomulus, Larfleeze himself shows up and attacks the Guardians. Accompanied by Sayd, Larfleeze attacks the Guardians, but when Kyle hears Sayd imply that there is a way to restore Ganthet to normal, he joins forces with the other ring-wielders and flees the Guardians, essentially resigning from the Corps while retaining his ring. Talking with Larfleeze, they learn that the rings were drawn to Kyle due to the actions of a mysterious spaceship that has just entered this universe. Larfleeze sent Glommulus to investigate it since he was able to resist the &quot;compulsion&quot; of the source that tried to remove his ring due to his prolonged contact with it, and the new team resolved to investigate this new threat. When they are attacked by the mysterious and powerful Archangel Invictus, who claims that all who wield the rings are evil, Kyle sends out a message to the other ring-wielders by convincing his ring to tap into his own emotions of hope, fear, and compassion to &quot;tune in&quot; to the appropriate &quot;wavelength&quot;. Learning of Invictus&#x27;s past history with Larfleeze, Kyle is able to trick him into letting the ring-bearers go by claiming that they will kill Larfleeze for him. With his ring low on power, Kyle returns to Earth with Bleez to recharge his ring, Bleez suggesting that Kyle will need protection from the Guardians after his expulsion while retaining his ring. Although he fails to reach the Blue Lanterns in time to save them from the invading Reach, Kyle is able to lead the New Guardians to fight Larfleeze and Invictus, subsequently learning that Sayd was responsible for turning him into a &quot;ring magnet&quot; in the hope that he would be able to bring the seven Corps together to save Ganthet, as both the only person who loved Ganthet as much as her and the only person able to wield all the powers of the emotional spectrum. Despite learning the truth about their origins, the New Guardians split up since they feel that the circumstances of their origin have tainted the team from the beginning regardless of Sayd&#x27;s motives.

===Rise of the Third Army===
Attempting to track down Hal, Kyle meets Carol Ferris as they witness a news report about Hal and Sinestro&#x27;s fight with Black Hand, prompting Carol to re-don her Sapphire ring to help Kyle battle the Black Lanterns, only to find nothing but &quot;conventional&quot; zombies. Although Kyle&#x27;s ring states that Hal was apparently dead, Carol rejects this idea as the link between her heart and Hal&#x27;s, which she is aware of although her ring is still intact. Through a vision from her ring, Carol realizes that Kyle must unite the powers of all seven Corps to stop this latest threat, despite Kyle&#x27;s uncertainty about his ability to channel the powers of rage or avarice even if he has already accessed the powers of hope and fear. Carol is able to contact Atrocitus to help train Kyle to harness the red ring of rage by arguing that Kyle will use that power against the Guardians. He attempts to provoke Kyle&#x27;s rage by reminding him of the death of his girlfriend Alex after he got the ring, but when this fails, Kyle instead feeling grief rather than anger, he takes Kyle to witness a group of people being threatened and executed in another country, Kyle&#x27;s anger at this provoking the activation of the red power within him, also turning him disturbingly cold toward the desecration of Alex&#x27;s grave. Although Arkillo and Larfleeze are able to help him harness the powers of fear and greed, it takes a confrontation with Ganthet to help Kyle harness the power of love since Kyle accepts his refusal to harm Ganthet despite what he has become due to his fatherly regard for Ganthet. With his powers at their peak, Kyle resolves to lead the Guardians in the confrontation against the Third Army.

===The Wrath of the First Lantern===
When the villainous First Lantern is freed, he began to drain all the Lantern Corps of their emotions, minds, and memories of the various beings present with the intention of seeing how their life choices had changed them. Kyle failed to fight off the First Lantern, which also has the powers of the white light and drains his emotions. The First Lantern teleports him back to his old home, leaving him weak. Later, Carol locates Kyle, who resists from his critical weak state, while Kyle and Carol arrive at the planet Korugar&#x27;s grave when Sinestro rages to attack them, blaming everyone for his home planet being destroyed. Sinestro demands Kyle revive Korugar with the White Lantern ring&#x27;s abilities, but Kyle is unable to do so. Sinestro flies off vowing to kill the First Lantern, while Kyle and Carol later team-up with Green Lanterns Simon Baz and B&#x27;dg.

In the final battle, Kyle and the reserve Lantern Corps attack the First Lantern, and he is finally destroyed. Afterwards, Kyle travels to Earth and helps other people with the White Lantern&#x27;s miracle power on his own. However, he is confronted by Saint Walker, who convinces him that he has to visit his own father, considering that Kyle has not seen him since the First Lantern&#x27;s attack. Later, Kyle arrives in Arizona and reunites with his father in his filling station.

===&quot;Lights Out&quot;===
During the &quot;Lights Out&quot; storyline, Kyle and the emotional entities travel into the Source Wall to restore the emotional spectrum. During this time, he sees the source of the universe and subconsciously creates the Oblivion entity to destroy himself so that he cannot endanger anyone else. However, various other ring-wielders, including Carol and the repowered Saint Walker, band together and convince him to have hope, resulting in Kyle working with the Templar Guardians into defeating Oblivion. Recognizing that the white light is too powerful for him to control full-time, Kyle splits his ring between himself and six other allies, allowing the option of the rings recombining into one if Kyle is faced with a serious threat.

===DC Rebirth===
Subsequently, in &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Kyle Rayner is one of the several individuals who feel the tremors of the green light of willpower when Hal Jordan forges a Green Power Ring for himself. When Hal is left badly wounded and in a realm between life and death after a confrontation with Sinestro, his ring travels to Ganthet and Sayd, who summon Kyle to help save Hal&#x27;s life. Kyle uses the power of his white ring and the former Guardians&#x27; power to open a doorway to Emerald Space in the afterlife, and manages to bring Hal back to the realm of the living. After the new truce between the Sinestro and Green Lantern Corps, Kyle attempts to use his ring to help Saint Walker bring the rest of the Blue Lantern Corps back to life, but some external force prevents Kyle channeling his power to that extent, resulting in him &#x27;downgrading&#x27; back to a conventional Green Lantern ring as the strain he had subjected his ring to causes it to &#x27;break up&#x27; back into the seven differently-colored rings, with Kyle retaining his original Green Lantern ring while the other six flies off to find new wielders. Kyle begins to initiate another relationship with Soranik. During the fight against the Prism Beasts, Kyle learns from the future Green Power Ring that Rip Hunter possessed, that Sarko is Kyle&#x27;s and Soranik&#x27;s future son. After Sarko&#x27;s death, Kyle is left demoralized and makes him more persistent to bring Soranik back to the Green Lantern Corp. Eventually she finds out about Kyle killing Sarko and falls under the influence of the Yellow Lantern and brands Kyle. She then attacks the Green Lanterns after finding out about one of their own killing a Yellow Lantern and later finds out the Power Battery had a fail-safe that prevents them from using it if they were to turn on them which makes her even more furious and retreats with her Corp.

=== Infinite Frontier ===
In &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;, a mysterious force attacks Oa, destroys the Green Lantern central power battery, and scatters the Lanterns across space. Kyle is among the Lanterns who disappear and are considered missing in action.

In &quot;Dark Crisis&quot;, Kyle is held in an alien prison before escaping and gaining a new ring from Hal Jordan and Sojourner Mullein. He accompanies them in freeing the Justice League before battling Pariah and the Great Darkness.

In &quot;DC All In&quot;, Kyle regains his White Lantern abilities to help battle Thaaros and Varron, who threaten the emotional spectrum.

==Powers and abilities==

As a Green Lantern, Kyle Rayner is semi-invulnerable, capable of projecting hard-light constructions, flight, and utilizing various other abilities through his power ring which are only limited by his imagination and willpower. Kyle&#x27;s constructs are much more elaborate than those of any other Green Lanterns, often fading into view like a sketch refined into an illustration. Eventually, he is able to utilize his skill as an artist to manipulate the pigments and dimensions within his constructs, making them appear so realistic that even Alan Scott was amazed at what Kyle could do with his ring&#x27;s creations.

Rayner&#x27;s ring was constructed from what remained of Hal Jordan&#x27;s ring by Ganthet. It is keyed to Rayner and Hal Jordan&#x27;s DNA, making it only accessible to them unless the bearer willed the ring to another individual. This is done by Ganthet to prevent the last ring from being stolen, as there would be no other Lantern to send to retrieve it. Unlike most of the Green Lanterns&#x27; rings, Kyle&#x27;s did not require a twenty-four-hour period of recharge, only when the ring&#x27;s capacity was depleted; and it was not necessary to recite the Corps&#x27; oath when recharged. Rayner is the first Lantern not to suffer from a weakness to items colored yellow. Both Mongul and Superman are surprised at this upon first encountering him. Kyle states that he didn&#x27;t know about the weakness and never had any trouble with it. Originally, this was explained as his ring being a &quot;new model&quot;, which also explained why it had slightly different abilities than those seen previously. Later, this was retconned with the explanation that rings can affect yellow if the user faces and overcomes their fear; as an artist, Kyle had faced his fear of rejection every time he showed his work, and this extended to his constructs, which he considered part of his artwork.

When bonded with the benevolent Ion symbiont, Rayner was capable of much more elaborate usage of his imagination which can extend to the manipulation of reality. In possession of the more sinister Parallax entity, Rayner was theoretically capable of similar feats.

During his relationship with Donna Troy, Rayner engaged in combat training with his then-girlfriend. During his first battle with Fatality, he proved to be a formidable fighter and was able to defeat her when his ring was drained. In nearly every encounter with Fatality since that incident, Kyle would use his combat skills to defeat her rather than his ring to maintain an element of surprise (she expected him to use his ring) or when his ring is drained or absent during battles. As a member of the Justice League, Kyle occasionally would train in the League&#x27;s combat training systems on the Watchtower and under the tutelage of combat-experienced Leaguers, such as Batman. Even though Rayner is now a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the Dark Knight himself, he is not an expert in hand-to-hand; for example, while he initially held his own in a hand-to-hand fight with Sinestro, the villain proved to be a better fighter due to his greater experience.

As an Honor Guard Illustres, Rayner ranks only below Salaak, who holds the rank of Clarissi, and the Guardians in the new Corps chain of command.

During a brief period where he was turned into a &#x27;magnet&#x27; for all rings, Kyle could briefly wield the power of the entire emotional spectrum, but the strain of doing so meant that the other six rings disintegrated after only a few moments, leaving him feeling significantly weakened by the effort. Despite all of the rings barring his own turning to dust, a measure of each ring&#x27;s power resides in Kyle which he is able to channel in a combined burst of multicolored lights, Sayd noting that Kyle is the only being she knows capable of bringing together the powers of all of the branches of the emotional spectrum. The ability to use any emotion spectrum light appears to be permanent, as Kyle is learning from different members of each Corps on how to use each power individually with limited success; he harnessed the power of Hope with relative ease, but required a brutal training session with Atrocitus to master Rage, while he only harnessed the power of Love during his fight with Ganthet.

After learning to master Avarice from a reluctant Larfleeze, Fear from Arkillo, and Compassion from Indigo-1 Kyle has learned how to harness the entire emotional spectrum and as a result became a White Lantern. As a White Lantern Kyle can heal injuries and ailments although by his own admission he can&#x27;t resurrect the dead. His ring is more powerful than a standard power ring and can replicate the abilities of any ring in the spectrum (except black) though the full extent of its abilities is yet to be revealed.

Kyle was later revealed to possess the Life Equation as a result of being inside the Source Wall. With the Equation, Kyle could manipulate reality itself. However, Kyle was unable to control this level of power and was dying because of it. As a result, Kyle divided the Life Equation by creating seven additional White Lantern power rings and gave them to the most worthy candidates. He swore to never unite the rings unless absolutely necessary. In the &quot;Rebirth&quot; storyline, when Kyle attempted to use the white ring to resurrect the Blue Lantern Corps, some unspecified force resisted his efforts, causing his ring to &#x27;break&#x27; into seven different rings of the seven Corps, the other six rings flying off to find new wielders while Kyle retained his original Green Lantern ring.

<doc id="1257796" wikidata="Q611576" url="?curid=1257796" title="Wally West">
<text>Wallace Rudolph &quot;Wally&quot; West is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics as the original [[Kid Flash]] and the third [[Flash (DC Comics character)|Flash]]. His power consists mainly of superhuman speed. The nephew of Iris West, he first appeared in &quot;Flash&quot; #110 (1959), which depicted his transformation into Kid Flash. Under the mantle of Kid Flash, Wally was depicted as a teenage sidekick to his uncle-by-marriage, Barry Allen, and a founding member of the Teen Titans. After Barry&#x27;s death in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; in 1985, Wally took on the role of the Flash in 1986, and was the main Flash in DC&#x27;s lineup until Barry returned in &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot; in 2009. He would later return as the main Flash in 2021, as part of the &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; relaunch.

In his debut as the Flash, Wally wears a distinct red and gold costume which, like his uncle, he traditionally stores compressed inside a ring. He later creates a costume directly out of Speed Force energy. Following his return in 2016, Wally is able to easily generate white lightning, which means his connection to the Speed Force is stronger than ever. During the first stage of his return, he temporarily wore an alternate red and silver costume when he wasn&#x27;t the main Flash.

Generally portrayed as a white man with red hair and green eyes, Wally was reinterpreted biracial for DC&#x27;s 2011 New 52 relaunch. A desire from fans to see the original interpretation of the character restored, however, led to Wally returning in 2016&#x27;s &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, while his New 52 reinterpretation was made into a separate character to avoid confusion.

Wally West has appeared in many other forms of media and was featured as the incarnation of the Flash in the Cartoon Network series &quot;Justice League&quot;, voiced by Michael Rosenbaum, and the 2010 film &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths&quot;, voiced by Josh Keaton. As Kid Flash, he appeared in Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Teen Titans&quot; series voiced again by Michael Rosenbaum and subsequently in the &quot;Young Justice&quot; series, voiced by Jason Spisak.

==Fictional character biography==

===Kid Flash===

Wallace Rudolph West II, or Wally West, was created by John Broome and Carmine Infantino and introduced in &quot;The Flash&quot; #110 (1959). The character was the nephew of the existing Flash character&#x27;s girlfriend and later wife, Iris West. During a visit to the Central City police laboratory where Barry Allen worked, the freak accident that gave Allen his powers repeated itself, bathing Wally in electrically charged chemicals. Now possessing the same powers as the Flash, West donned a smaller-sized copy of Barry Allen&#x27;s Flash outfit and became the young crimefighter Kid Flash. Wally had a strained relationship with his own parents and often looked to his beloved aunt and uncle for moral support and guidance. He also operated as a lone superhero in his hometown, Blue Valley, Nebraska, when not partnering with the Flash.

This costume was later altered in &quot;The Flash&quot; #135 (1963) to one that would make him more visually distinctive. The original red was replaced with a costume that was primarily yellow with red leggings, gloves and lightning bolt emblem. The ear pieces initially remained yellow, but became red in later issues.

In addition to his appearances within the &quot;Flash&quot; title, the character was a founding member of the newly created Teen Titans, where he became friends with Dick Grayson, then known as Robin, later known as Nightwing. Sometime later, Wally contracted a mysterious illness that affected his entire bodily system; the more he used his speed powers, the faster his body deteriorated. This could have been caused by one of two things, Wally was a boy when the electrified chemicals altered his body, which was still developing and maturing (as opposed to Barry Allen, who was already an adult when his accident occurred) or when he was struck with a weapon during his time with the Teen Titans. As such, as Wally&#x27;s body matured, his altered body chemistry was slowly killing him.

During the 1985–1986 miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Barry gave his life to save the Earth by destroying an antimatter cannon. Initially unaware of this, Wally was coaxed by Jay Garrick into assisting the heroes against the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s forces. During the final battle with the Anti-Monitor, Wally was struck by a blast of anti-matter energy, which cured his disease. In the aftermath of the conflict, Wally took on his fallen mentor&#x27;s costume and identity.

The decision by DC Comics&#x27; editorial staff to radically change their fictional universe saw a number of changes to the status quo of the character. Wally West became the new Flash, but less powerful than his predecessor. For example, instead of being able to reach the speed of light, he could run just faster than that of sound. Also, the character had to eat vast quantities of food to maintain his metabolism.

Those changes were quickly followed up and 1987 saw the publication of a new &quot;Flash&quot; comic, initially written by Mike Baron. These stories focused not only on the Flash&#x27;s superhero exploits, but the state of Wally&#x27;s wealth. West won a lottery, bought a large mansion, and began dating beautiful women. The character&#x27;s finances and luck continued to ebb and wane until &quot;The Flash&quot; vol. 2 #62, when his fortunes stabilized.
The 1990s also saw further modifications to the look of the character, with a modified uniform appearing in 1991. This modified costume altered the visual appearance of the traditional Flash costume, with a belt made of two connecting lightning bolts meeting in a &quot;V&quot; at the front (where Allen&#x27;s costume had a single bolt in a horizontal band), removal of the wings from the top of his boots, a change in the material of his costume (giving it a slight metallic luster), and opaque lenses added to the eyes of his cowl. This modified design utilized elements of the costume designed by artist Dave Stevens for the live-action television series &quot;The Flash&quot;.
A difficult encounter was made with a vicious foe, the first Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawne). Thawne had been killed by Barry Allen shortly before Allen&#x27;s death, but this version of Thawne was from a time period before he originally became Allen&#x27;s enemy - also served to increase the speed of the character, forcing him to push past a psychological block he had placed on his powers. To prevent himself from truly &quot;replacing&quot; Barry, Wally had subconsciously limited his speed so that he could never become his mentor&#x27;s equal, but when Thawne arrived in the present and briefly posed as Barry Allen, his bragging that he would become the true Flash forced Wally past this block, as he feared Thawne replacing Barry more than he feared himself doing so. After this encounter, he was again Barry Allen&#x27;s equal in speed, and eventually became even faster. Though he still had not been able to recover Barry&#x27;s vibrational/phasing abilities for a time (he could vibrate through objects but this would cause the object to explode), he gained several new powers that Barry never had. He was able to share/steal speed, use his speed to kinetically upgrade his attacks, and super heal others, resulting him become so powerful that he even able to defeat physically stronger foes like Superman&#x27;s enemy Mongul.

Writer Mark Waid expanded on the character&#x27;s powers thematically and further redefined the character by introducing the Speed Force, an energy source that served as a pseudo-scientific explanation for his powers and that of other speedsters. Using this concept as a basis, the character&#x27;s ability to tap into the Speed Force was used to expand his abilities. The character was now able to lend speed to other objects and people and create a costume directly out of Speed Force energy. Traditional powers such as the ability to vibrate through solid objects were also restored. Because of this, the Flash felt pressured into having to constantly be heroic 24/7. During this time, he joined the Justice League.

The 2000s saw writer Geoff Johns revitalize the character by introducing new versions of characters such as Zoom; making significant use of the Rogues; and marrying the character to longtime girlfriend Linda Park. Other changes included restoring the Flash to a secret identity; his identity had been public since shortly after Barry Allen&#x27;s death, but the traumatic events of his first battle with Zoom prompted Wally to make a deal with the Spectre to erase his identity from public knowledge.

During the &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; crossover, Wally and Kyle Rayner learned Dr. Light&#x27;s mindwipe by the original Justice League and the cause of the villain&#x27;s transformation from a dangerous serial rapist to an ineffectual buffoon. When Dr. Light vows revenge against the League, Wally realizes that the villain is again a powerful threat. He then warns the Teen Titans and Outsiders not to underestimate Dr. Light, and later joins their fight against him.

In the miniseries &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, as a narrative device, Wally West and his family were seen leaving for an alternative reality. This allowed the character Bart Allen to become the fourth Flash and headline a relaunched third volume of the title, called &quot;The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive&quot;.

The critical reaction to this new version of the Flash was mixed and Bart was killed off in the final issue of the short-lived third volume. It was decided that Wally West should return, and the JLA/JSA story &quot;The Lightning Saga&quot; was used to return the character to Earth along with his wife and children, who appear to have aged several years.

The character next appeared in &quot;All Flash&quot; #1 (2007), seeking vengeance on those who had killed Bart Allen. This was followed by &quot;The Flash&quot; vol. 2, which resumed publication after the long hiatus with issue #231 (October 2007). The series found the character struggling with trying to raise his two super-powered twins, plagued by accelerated growth and their inexperience in the heroic game, a task made more difficult by Wally&#x27;s unemployment, his inability to keep a steady job, and the mistrust of the League for his decision to bring two children into the fold. The series was canceled with issue #247 (February 2009).

In &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, the character was reunited with Barry Allen, who had returned to life. Later, in &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot;, Wally makes modifications on his costume&#x27;s cowl and emblem to further differentiate himself from Barry.

===&quot;Blackest Night&quot;===
During the Blackest Night, Wally West assists Barry Allen in spreading the word to every hero on Earth about the rise of the Black Lantern Corps. When Black Hand brings back Nekron, Barry is attacked by an army of Black Lanterns, while struggling to fight them off, Wally comes to his rescue, bringing with him the Justice League &amp; Teen Titans, Bart Allen, the Kid Flash, among them. The three Flashes fight their way through Black Lanterns and charge at Nekron. Before they can strike, the Black Lantern Guardian Scar attacks them, attempting to convince them into becoming Black Lanterns. Right after, Hal Jordan and the leaders of the seven Lantern Corps arrive to assist. The heroes attack the Black Lanterns, but when Black Hand reanimates Batman&#x27;s corpse as a Black Lantern, the resulting emotional shock allows the Black Lantern rings to latch onto the resurrected heroes, transforming Superman, Superboy, Wonder Woman, Green Arrow, Black Canary, and Kid Flash into Black Lanterns. Black Lantern Bart Allen attacks Barry Allen, and the two brawl for a moment before Wally fights him off. A pair of Black Lantern Rings then lock onto Barry and Hal. Wally flees with Barry, with Barry telling him to stay and protect himself and Bart. Barry and Hal then flee the scene to avoid becoming Black Lanterns.

===Return: &quot;The New 52&quot; and &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
Following the 2011 reboot of the DC comics universe, Wally West appears to have never existed. A seemingly new interpretation of Wally West was introduced in &quot;The Flash&quot; vol. 4 Annual #3. Originally portrayed as the New 52 version of the classic and original character and the biracial son of Rudy West, this biracial Wally, later renamed Ace West to avoid confusion, was retconned in &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; #1 as being the cousin of Wally West and son of the New 52 Reverse-Flash, Daniel West. Both cousins are explained as having been named after their great-grandfather.

The existence of Wally West is hinted at in the final issue of &quot;Titans Hunt&quot;, in which the various original Teen Titans remember their bond to each other, but realize that they are still forgetting an important final member of their team. They look out to the ocean as lightning strikes.

Wally West is reintroduced to DC continuity a week later in a &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; story. The story reveals that following the Flashpoint event, Wally became lost in the Speed Force for 10 years. While trapped, he came to realize that Barry had not been responsible for the mutation of the New Earth universe into Prime Earth but that an unknown entity had used Barry&#x27;s time-traveling to fundamentally alter reality. The fallout of the recent &quot;Darkseid War&quot; allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth. Each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force. After realizing that not even Linda could remember him, Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before his uncle, Barry, one last time to thank him for the life he had given him. Just before Wally disappeared, Barry remembered him and dragged him out of the Speed Force. Wally&#x27;s presence integrates his Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; history to the new timeline to accommodate his existence, resetting his past and those who associated with him. Following a tearful reunion, Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come. Although the two decide to keep Wally&#x27;s return secret from Iris based on Wally&#x27;s own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the &quot;Flash&quot; rather than &#x27;Kid Flash&#x27;. Wally goes to the Titans, and through both physical contact to Nightwing, Donna Troy, Arsenal, Tempest and Lilith Clay with the Speed Force reminding them of their memories with him, creating a new history. After an emotional reunion with his friends, he tells them of the situation. Wally believes that the unknown entity will attack again to prevent them from finding out the truth, which they will do together as Titans.

Directly after the events in &quot;Titans: Rebirth&quot;, Lilith has Wally repeat the story of his return for her to use it as a means of making the mental connections between him, herself and the Titans stronger. While doing this, she notices the most powerful thought in Wally&#x27;s mind is that of Linda Park, which sparks various, but supportive, reactions from the other Titans. Nightwing encourages Wally to seek Linda out and try and make new memories with her. Elsewhere, Linda is still puzzled by Wally&#x27;s sudden presence in her life and decides to investigate him further. During a confrontation with Abra Kadabra, Wally is forced to push himself so fast that he is sent into the Speed Force while trying to save her and the other Titans from being killed by Kadabra, but in a conversation with a manifestation of his memories of Linda, Wally is encouraged not to give up on the idea that he can make a new relationship with her in this timeline, subsequently using his memories of the Titans as a new &#x27;lightning-rod&#x27; to return to Earth. Afterwards, Wally is visited by Superman, who confirms that he, like Wally, remembers the world that existed before history was &#x27;edited&#x27;.

Later, Deathstroke wanted to use the Speed Force to save his son and takes out Wally. Ace West and Damian Wayne managed to save Wally, but Damian Wayne had to stop Wally West&#x27;s heart momentarily, making Wally West have a heart pacer. After that adventure, while on a mission with the Titans, Wally learned that he has the ability to go fast and stop time as well.

After a battle against Psimon, Mister Twister, and the Key, Wally used too much of his abilities, and he seemingly dies. However, Kid Flash (Ace West) senses Wally&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; and rushes to find him. After noticing Wally West &quot;dead&quot;, Kid Flash senses that Wally is not completely dead and he revives him by jumpstarting his heart, curing Wally of his pacemaker condition. Wally West then helps the Titans defeat Donna Troy&#x27;s evil self from an alternate future, Troia, and the other villains.

When Barry confronts Wally about how he has not made any real effort to make contact with Iris, rebuild things with Linda, or even try to make a new life for himself, Wally tries to compensate for this by tracking down Frances Kane, but his initial contact with her also re-awakens her old psychological issues, causing her to attack Wally before he calms her down by confessing his own fears about his current circumstances. Inspired by this conversation, Wally calls Dick Grayson to help him purchase an apartment. However, Wally is unaware that his friend-turned-foe Hunter Zolomon has returned. Now in a position of authority in the 25th century, Zolomon sends the Renegades into the past to arrest Iris for the murder of Eobard Thawne with the intention of provoking a war between the Flashes to make &#x27;the true Flash&#x27; stronger through tragedy. After the Flash Family defeated Gorilla Grodd in a battle, Wally meets Iris for the first time after his disappearance. He begins remembering Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; memories after Iris remembers him. However, a confrontation with his former ally Hunter Zolomon provokes Barry and Wally into conflict, as Hunter convinces Wally that the Speed Force must be destroyed to release those missing allies still &#x27;trapped&#x27; within it, including Wally&#x27;s children, Jai and Iris West, Max Mercury and Impulse. Wally became determined to break the Speed Force open in a bid to free them which led to a frantic chase, with Barry Allen trying to stop Wally before he did something drastic, remembering all too well the damage he himself had done to the time-stream attempting to stop his mother&#x27;s murder during the Flashpoint event. Unfortunately, Wally proved himself to be the true Fastest Man Alive and was able to outrun Barry and create the break he wanted. The resulting explosion sent both heroes back to Barry&#x27;s hometown of Central City and into the clutches of a gloating Zoom who quickly revealed that his true intention in reminding Wally about the existence of his children was to trick Wally into breaking the Force Barrier - a cosmic barricade that concealed energies that could be tapped into by the right people in much the same way that the Speed Force empowers speedsters. These energies include the Sage Force - seemingly based around telepathic and telekinetic powers - and the Strength Force. Zoom discovered the existence of these energies by reading 25th-century history books and determined a way to tap into these energies as well as the Speed Force once the Force Barrier was broken. He also donned a replica of Barry Allen&#x27;s costume, declaring himself the one true Flash, before deciding that he would spare Barry and Wally the pain of their future lives by ending them now.

====Heroes in Crisis====
During the &quot;Heroes in Crisis&quot; story arc, Wally was initially believed to be one of the massacre&#x27;s highest-profile victims at the superhero rehabilitation facility known as Sanctuary, but is later revealed to be not only alive but actually the real culprit of the murders. Wally explains all in his confession, one of the many recorded video transcripts that Wally himself sent to Lois Lane, while identifying himself as &quot;The Puddler&quot;, that he&#x27;s felt &quot;alone&quot; since his return, as his family remains wiped from existence, with no one even to remember them, except him. These tortured memories are what led him to Sanctuary in the first place, but he found no comfort there, instead, he relates how he still felt alone because he didn&#x27;t see the same kind of pain in its other residents, and the program&#x27;s anonymity only compounded his feelings of isolation. Wally therefore did some digging of his own into Sanctuary&#x27;s resident records and uncovered a truth that he had been denying. Every one of the heroes at Sanctuary were in fact coping and trying to overcome their own personal traumas, just as Wally was. Uncovering all this information at superspeed led to a flood of emotional experiences that momentarily allowed Wally to understand he wasn&#x27;t so alone after all. While this realization might have initially given Wally some comfort, it all came to him in a comparative instant. Instead of helping to heal him, the onslaught of emotions broke him. In turn, he momentarily lost control of the powers of the Speed Force contained within him and in another fateful instant, the powers of the Speed Force were unleashed on the other heroes within Sanctuary, killing them instantly.

Wally accessing Sanctuary&#x27;s files had tripped the facility&#x27;s alarm, and the moment of Wally&#x27;s breakdown happened, Harley and Booster were immersed in their respective virtual reality therapy sessions. Taking advantage of that happy coincidence, Wally used his powers to deliver a superspeed sleight of hand at Harley and Booster&#x27;s expense. As each exited their VR chambers, he reprogrammed them and tricked the pair into thinking they had left the chambers, when in fact they had not. Instead of seeing the actual massacre, what each instead saw was the other murdering Wally.

From there, Wally stole Booster&#x27;s time-traveling tech, went five days into the future, killed his future self and brought his future body back to present day to leave at the scene. Wally&#x27;s machinations are what led Booster to discover that dead Wally&#x27;s body was five days too old. Wally then relocated all the bodies of the others he had slain, staging the murders to place himself above suspicion, and set up Harley and Booster as the prime suspects instead. To complete the subterfuge, Wally then destroyed Sanctuary&#x27;s computer and robot attendants, and scribbled the now-infamous &quot;The puddlers are all dead&quot; on Sanctuary&#x27;s living room wall. He successfully misdirected everyone involved in the investigation until Ted Kord, Booster Gold, Batgirl and Harley Quinn figured out that Wally was the key to the murders, and they devised a way to track Wally&#x27;s time disturbance by utilizing Skeets and Kord Industries tech.

They show up just as Wally is about to kill five-days-older-Wally, and five-days Wally reveals that after he accidentally killed everyone in Sanctuary, he didn&#x27;t travel back in time to “unmake” his mistake because that&#x27;s what Barry did during Flashpoint, instead he sent the confession files to Lois Lane to try to “make up for what happened,” telling the world what he&#x27;d done at Sanctuary, and encouraging people to get help before they made the same mistakes he did. Five-days-older Wally reveals that this is the same thing that happened to him five days ago - that he also didn&#x27;t kill the older Wally. Booster Gold explains that they can still “close” the loop, even without the dead body of five-days-older Wally. They can go to the 25th Century and “speed-clone” older Wally. Then younger Wally can take that cloned body back to the past. The Justice League eventually arrived and arrested Wally for the murders.

In &quot;The Flash&quot; #761, it was revealed that Eobard Thawne was responsible for manipulating Wally into killing the heroes at Sanctuary. Later this whole story was recollected in &quot;The Flash&quot; Annual #1 (2021), stating that Wally West was not responsible for these deaths, and it was revealed that the Speed Force caused it while trying to expel Savitar.

====&quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;====
In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Lex Luthor mentioned to Lois Lane that someone has been undermining creation, like what Doctor Manhattan did with Wally West and the Justice Society of America. When Doctor Manhattan altered the multiverse and created the New 52 Universe, Wally, prior to being freed in &quot;DC Universe: Rebirth #1&quot;, briefly escaped the Speed Force to warn Doctor Manhattan that he knows what the latter did and that the heroes of the DC Universe will stop him. Wally was pulled back into the Speed Force afterward.

====&quot;Flash-Forward&quot; and &quot;Generation&quot;====
Wally is later recruited by Tempus Fuginaut who wants him to restore the balance between the Light and Dark Multiverses. After saving several universes from being consumed by dark-matter, Wally finds the Mobius Chair that once belonged to Metron and makes a deal with Fuginaut to return his children Jai and Iris, who were trapped in the Dark Multiverse, to his wife Linda Park. But after sitting upon the chair, Wally, in addition to obtaining a cosmic level of knowledge, also obtains the powers of Doctor Manhattan, after he put a fraction of his power into the chair. Wally&#x27;s costume and lightning proceeded to turn to the blue of Manhattan, with Manhattan&#x27;s logo forming on his forehead, and Wally now losing nearly all sense of emotion he had and now seeking logic and knowledge. After finding out that Doctor Manhattan did not completely heal the universe after &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Wally uses his powers to restore the timeline.

===&quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;===
Following the 2021 event &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot; #0, Wally is restored as the primary Flash and central character in &quot;The Flash&quot; series since #768, after Barry Allen&#x27;s departure to join Justice Incarnate, eventually again donning the costume he designed during &quot;The Flash: Rebirth&quot; events. Wally&#x27;s first storyline in the solo title sees him travel through the timeline as he attempts to prevent a destructive release of something in the Speed Force, which sees him meet his daughter, Iris, in the future as an accomplished Flash. In the arc&#x27;s conclusion, in &quot;The Flash Annual 2021&quot;, Wally is thrown back to the moment of his greatest torment: the explosion at Sanctuary which killed his friends. He is unburdened by the revelation that this was not his fault, but rather that of the same Speed Force phenomenon, caused by the mad speedster Savitar and the Speed Force&#x27;s attempts to expel him from its interior. With help from Mister Terrific, Barry Allen, Green Arrow, and the past Roy Harper shortly before he died at Sanctuary, Wally is able to bring Savitar back with him to the present. Although Savitar easily overcomes Superman and Batman, Barry tells Wally to step up, making use of his superior bond to the Speed Force to defeat, depower, and imprison Savitar once again. Fully Redeemed and more powerful than ever, Wally returns to Linda and the kids, enthusiastic to serve as Central City&#x27;s Flash once again. Sometime later, Wally shares an emotional reunion with a newly resurrected Roy at the Teen Titans Academy.

In &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Wally West was among those who attended a party held by the Flash family.

==Powers and abilities==

Wally&#x27;s primary superpower is his ability to control the speed at which his body vibrates and to move and think at Super-Speed, which he uses primarily to run at extreme superhuman velocities. His power originates from his mainline-connection to the Speed Force: a vaguely-defined extra-dimensional and infinite energy source from which most speedster heroes gain their powers. Wally is both the fastest character to have worn the mantle of the Flash and the Prime Earth/DC Rebirth Wally was confirmed by Tempus Fuginaut to be the fastest character within the DC Multiverse (with the exception of deity level characters, meaning characters such as Dr. Manhattan, Michael, and Lucifer, or the Presence, the God of the DC Multiverse are technically faster than Wally). 
While most to all speedsters can make a connection and draw upon this force, Wally &quot;mainlines&quot; power from the Speed Force itself and cannot be cut off from the source. This connection to the Speed Force grants him unique abilities that other speedsters lack, such as lending and taking speed (which manifests in different ways, ranging from becoming speedsters themselves to bolstering others metabolisms and healing abilities, allowing them to recover from injuries in a fraction of the normal time), as well as absorbing kinetic energy in a less direct manner; he once absorbed the kinetic energy of the entire planet Earth while standing at the North Pole when his teammates were forced to move the planet to prevent possible earthquakes. Wally has also found a way to create a costume out of pure Speed Force energy.

Like all Flashes, Wally is surrounded by a protective aura that allows him to resist the heat created by the pressure of compressed air caused by moving at super speed as well as other environmental consequences of moving at such velocities. It is not known how Wally is able to circumvent the damage moving at such great speeds would normally have on the environment, but it has been hypothesized that his protective aura allows him to &quot;sidestep&quot; such environmental consequences. Because of his powers and connection to the Speed Force, he can run at varying speeds for extended periods of time without needing rest or causing damage to his body. It is his connection to the Speed Force that constantly rejuvenates him while running, making it so he does not literally feed upon his own body to generate the energy for super speed. Even so, he has a sped-up metabolism and finds it necessary to eat often and in great quantities to help supply the chemical energy needed.

Using his abilities, Wally can run at such speed that he can run on water, create powerful vortexes with his arms or body, and vibrate at such speeds that he becomes invisible to the naked eye. Wally can also match the vibrational constant of solid objects and vibrate through them, passing his molecules through the spaces in between the atoms and molecules of the matter he is vibrating through, however, Wally accidentally destabilizes whatever he passes through, causing it to explode. While this has its drawbacks, Wally has learned to use this offensively in battle. Since Rebirth 2016, Wally improves this ability and can vibrate through objects without causing them to explode.

Instead of using the cosmic treadmill as his uncle Barry, Wally can use his speed to travel through time. In Flash #150, he traveled back to the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and battled the Anti-Monitor, speed-blitzing him until his shell was destroyed. He also outran death to the edge of the universe and beyond, where death didn&#x27;t even exist and continued to run to get Linda back. There was a comic series titled The Human Race in which Wally ran faster than instant teleportation, Reaching Trans-Time Velocity. &quot;The Flash&quot; vol 2 #177 had Wally outrun the gravitational pull of a black hole. Using Jessie Quick&#x27;s speed formula combined with his speed steal, Wally can temporally accelerate to the point where he escapes linear time, essentially allowing him to function like the chronokinetic Zoom.

Wally has even become so fast and so powerful, that he became faster than the Speed Force itself.

Some interpretations of Wally are shown as having above-average strength. In the &quot;Justice League&quot; episode &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, the gorilla Solovar tells Wally that he weighed around 400  lbs; Wally then proceeded to lift Solovar and run to safety.

Wally is also a skilled science prodigy. In some versions, Wally uses these skills to recreate the accident that gave Barry his powers by himself, granting himself his own powers. Like his mentor, Wally understands what his speed enables him to do, and uses his knowledge of physics to his advantage in battle. He has extensive knowledge and experience with Time-Travel and the Multiverse, and was also considered by Michael Holt, aka Mister Terrific, to be one of the smartest people he knew, and was given a job as a mechanic/engineer at TerrificTech.

After his return to the DC Universe, Wally is said to be even faster than before. Titans (2016) #5 issue, established that the Speed Force is inside Wally more than ever before. He can generate white lightning, which combines all the colors of the Speed Force. Also in DC Rebirth, Wally learned that he can sense when time has been manipulated, as well as listen to the Speed Force, which allows him to sense disruptions in the space-time continuum.

Wally is a talented fighter in his own right and was trained in hand-to-hand combat by people like Barry Allen and Dick Grayson while training people like Bart Allen and his own children as a fighter. He is known to often use Judo in his fighting style.

==Allies and friends==
Wally&#x27;s father, Rudolph West (a Manhunter agent), was presumed deceased following an explosion in Cuba during the &quot;Invasion&quot; series. He reappeared years later at, among other places, his ex-wife Mary West&#x27;s (Wally&#x27;s mother) second wedding. They both later attended Wally and Linda&#x27;s wedding. Wally also has an older brother-like relationship with his younger cousin Wallace, whom he sometimes refers to as &quot;Ace&quot;. Wally&#x27;s kids Jai and Irey also consider Ace to be their uncle.

Wally&#x27;s best friend is Dick Grayson, who was the first Robin and current Nightwing. Wally and Dick became close as founding members of both the Teen Titans and the Titans. Their respective mentors, Barry Allen and Bruce Wayne, are also good friends and frequently team up with each other, meaning that when Wally was Kid Flash and Dick was Robin, the two often accompanied their mentors and each other when Bruce and Barry worked together. Dick later served as the best man at Wally and Linda&#x27;s wedding.

Similar to the friendship of Barry Allen/Flash and Hal Jordan/Green Lantern, Wally West is also close friends with Kyle Rayner, his generation&#x27;s Green Lantern. Wally is also close friends with other Green Lanterns like John Stewart and Hal, who often looked out for Wally even while he was the Spectre.

While they disagree regularly, Wally has developed an odd friendship/respect with Bruce Wayne/Batman (Bruce is also Dick&#x27;s adoptive father), who has more than once made it clear that those feelings are mutual.

The members of the New Teen Titans, the team Wally served on as Kid Flash, have reappeared several times throughout his life. Although they are not always in close contact with one another, the team consider each other family; Wally is no exception.

===Supporting cast===
Wally has developed an extensive supporting cast over the duration of his comic series that began in 1987. A few are former villains and adversaries, such as Pied Piper, Speed Demon, and Chunk.

*Linda Park-West – Wally West&#x27;s girlfriend and later wife. She is a Korean-American television reporter for Keystone City, although she later goes to medical school. Park is West&#x27;s &quot;lightning rod&quot; when traveling in the Speed Force. She first appeared in &quot;The Flash&quot; (vol. 2) #28 and was created by William Messner-Loebs.
*Mary West – Wally&#x27;s mother.
*Iris West – Wally&#x27;s aunt, returned from the future. Iris was a role model for Wally growing up and one of the inspirations behind his career as the Flash.

*Connie Noleski – A model and girlfriend of Wally&#x27;s in his early career as the Flash. She is currently married to Chunk.
*Chester P. Runk (a.k.a. Chunk) – A brilliant physicist who became a walking black hole after a matter-transmitting machine he invented imploded during its first test.
*Mason Trollbridge – The former kid sidekick of a hard-edged Depression-era crimefighter known as the Clipper.
*Pied Piper – One of Barry Allen&#x27;s former Rogues whom Wally and Linda befriended. Piper even confessed his homosexuality to Wally on a rooftop while in discussion with him about the Joker.

*Jai West and Iris West and Wade West – Wally and Linda&#x27;s 3 children. Aged 1 chronologically, but physically about 8 due to an unstable connection to the Speed Force. Wally had to teach them at super-speed, so they are mentally about the same age as they are physically. Following their nearly being killed by their powers, all of it was transferred to Iris, who became the new Impulse.
