<text>The Parents Television and Media Council (PTMC), formerly the Parents Television Council (PTC), is an American media advocacy group founded by conservative political pundit L. Brent Bozell III in 1995, which advocates for what it considers to be responsible, family-friendly content across all media platforms, and for advertisers to be held accountable for the content of television programs that they sponsor. The PTMC officially describes itself as a non-partisan organization, although the group has also been described as partisan and socially conservative.

The PTMC produces reviews, research reports, and online newsletters that highlight television programs and other entertainment products (such as music videos and video games) based on their suitability for family viewing. The PTMC has advocated for cable television networks to be subject to the same decency rules as broadcast television, and for television providers to allow subscribers to purchase channels on an individual basis. The group has also been critical of the TV Parental Guidelines system, often deeming the ratings given by broadcasters to be inaccurate in comparison to their own assessments of a program&#x27;s content.

It has mounted pressure campaigns against the producers, broadcasters, and sponsors of programming that they perceive to be indecent or harmful to children (such as those containing undue sexual content, profane language, and violence); these campaigns typically include the organized mass mailing of form letters and emails to advertising sponsors of unapproved programs, organized mass filing of complaints via the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website complaint form, and direct threats of long, potentially costly FCC license challenges to local network affiliates planning to broadcast what the council considers harmful network programming.

Throughout its existence, the Parents Television and Media Council has been accused of promoting censorship. In 2004, the FCC reported that the group was the primary source of most content complaints received by the commission.

==History==

In 1989, the Media Research Center (MRC) began monitoring the entertainment industry for alleged liberal bias through its Entertainment Division and newsletter &quot;TV, etc.&quot; MRC founder and president L. Brent Bozell III later felt that &quot;decency&quot; was declining on most prime-time television programming. The PTC began operations in 1995 following private planning meetings with Charlton Heston, Michael Medved, and others in the entertainment industry, who would eventually make up the advisory board of the PTC. After the release of its first annual &quot;Family Guide to Prime-Time Television&quot; following the 1995–1996 television season, the PTC hoped to hold the entertainment industry accountable for the indecency that it perceived to be prominent on prime-time television. By 1996, the organization had the support of several members of the U.S. Congress, including Joe Lieberman and Lamar S. Smith, and an estimated annual budget of $142,000.

By 1998, with an estimated membership of 120,000, comedian and former &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; host Steve Allen joined PTC as its Honorary Chairman, and PTC released a report questioning the accuracy of the TV Parental Guidelines ratings system and campaigning for advertisers to stop sponsoring programs that the PTC claimed were offensive. Allen launched a newspaper advertisement campaign promoting the PTC, which was published in many outlets including &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The PTC was noted for criticizing such shows as &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Ellen&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, and &quot;Spin City&quot;. Its website was also introduced that year, and its annual budget had already surpassed $1 million. PTC rolled out another round of full-page newspaper advertisements in 1999; &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; television columnist Tim Goodman perceived Allen and the PTC of advocating complete censorship of television to allow only what PTC considered &quot;Family-Safe TV&quot;.

The PTC lost nearly $1 million in 2008 and in 2009 received $2.9 million in revenue, a 29 percent drop from the previous year. In 2009 and 2010, the PTC cut its staff by 38 percent to save money.

On April 14, 2021, the organization changed its name to the Parents Television and Media Council &quot;to better reflect its mission to advocate for responsible entertainment on all entertainment media platforms&quot;.

==Leadership==

PTC was founded in 1995 by longtime political activist L. Brent Bozell III. Bozell is a prominent conservative activist who has, among other things, served as executive director of the Conservative Victory Committee, a political action committee that has supported the election of dozens of conservative candidates. He was also National Finance Chairman for Pat Buchanan&#x27;s 1992 presidential campaign, and later president of the National Conservative Political Action Committee. Bozell was succeeded as PTC President by Timothy F. Winter. Winter served as executive director of the PTC for three years prior to becoming president. Prior to joining the PTC, Mr. Winter&#x27;s 20-year career as a media executive included positions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and NBC. Until 2015 when his position was terminated, Dan Isett, Director of Corporate and Government Affairs of the PTC, represented the PTC on the Consumer Advisory Committee of the Federal Communications Commission.

==Advisory board==
The PTC also has an advisory board consisting of politicians and entertainers working to assist the council in their goal of protecting children against profanity and violence in the media. Notable members of the advisory board have included singer Pat Boone, former football player Mel Renfro, writer-producer Coleman Luck, country musician Billy Ray Cyrus, comedian and actor Tim Conway of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, former U.S. Senator from Kansas and 2008 presidential candidate Sam Brownback, film critic Michael Medved, star of 1980s soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; Susan Howard, and ION Television producer Gary Johnson. In addition, the PTC has established numerous local chapters for most American media markets. Notable former advisory board members include - both of whom are now deceased - comedian Steve Allen, original host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and C. Delores Tucker, participant in the Civil Rights Movement and activist against gangsta rap music; Allen is now given the title of National Honorary Chairman-Emeritus. Bahçeşehir University associate professor Christian Christiansen questioned the backgrounds of certain PTC advisory board members as not consistent with their stance on morality.

==Publications==

===Columns and reports===
The website of the PTC features reports on what the group says is harmful content on television and regular writings from its staff. Their research is done with the support of their Entertainment Tracking System, an archive of prime-time television programming that they claim is the largest in the world. Such publications include:
* &quot;Culture Watch&quot; – Throughout 2005 and 2006, the PTC published columns under this series authored by Christopher Gildemeister, covering the influence on American culture by entertainment as well as exposing the increase in sex, violence, and profanity in cable television and the methods used by advertisers and broadcasting companies to attract young audiences. In a December 2005 column of his, &quot;Advertising Age&quot; columnist Simon Dumenco criticized the PTC, arguing that the PTC is &quot;very very afraid of gay TV characters&quot;. Gildemeister defended the PTC as being &quot;not homophobic&quot; but simply opposed to &quot;sexual references or innuendo (of any variety, hetero, homo or other) aired where children might be exposed to them.&quot;
* &quot;Parenting and the Media&quot; authored by Rod Gustafson, where he offers advice on parenting children who frequent the media.
*&quot;TV Trends&quot; – Another column by Christopher Gildemeister, published since October 2007 intending to inform parents and TV viewers in general about what he determines to be &quot;harmful or questionable prime-time programming.&quot; &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; television critic Roger Catlin quoted Gildemeister as criticizing ABC for having an &quot;apparent fetish for transsexuals&quot; in certain programs.
*Former president Bozell&#x27;s weekly entertainment column, which it links to within the home page

In 2000, PTC&#x27;s report &quot;What a Difference a Decade Makes&quot; allegedly stated that there was an increase in profanity, sex, and violence on television during the 1990s. The report also claimed that references to homosexuality increased the most during that decade – by a factor of 24. In 2002, the PTC released a report claiming that there was an increase in profanity on network programming shown during the first hour of prime time. In a 2006 report titled &quot;Wolves in Sheep&#x27;s Clothing&quot;, analyst Kristen Fyfe reported an increase in violent, profane, and sexual content in children&#x27;s programming. Among its results, based on research during summer 2005, the PTC stated that &quot;Teen Titans&quot; was the most violent program, and claimed Cartoon Network had the most violent incidents. Richard Huff of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; criticized the report for misinterpreting an episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;Sailor Mouth&quot;, over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly.

Following the 2005–06 television season, PTC issued a report &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; that analyzed depictions of religion in primetime television. The study stated that most positive references to religion were on reality shows such as &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;, while claiming that scripted shows tended to be more negative towards it. The report also ranked Fox as the &quot;most anti-religious network&quot;, followed by NBC, UPN, ABC, CBS, and the WB. In 2008, PTC published a report titled &quot;Happily Never After&quot;, using analysis of several primetime shows early in the 2007-2008 television season that asserted that extramarital sex was more favored on television shows during that time period. Ian O&#x27;Doherty of &quot;The Irish Independent&quot; asked regarding the PTC&#x27;s marriage depiction study: &quot;After all, would you rather watch people having fun or would you rather watch a realistic depiction of marriage, which ... would simply be an hour of two people sullenly chewing their food, pausing occasionally only to throw each other filthies and occasionally grumbling under their breath how the biggest regret of their life was ever setting eyes on you and that their mother was right all along?&quot; PTC released a report in October 2009 stating that prime-time television shows on broadcast networks had twice as many depictions of violence against women in 2009 than in 2004.

In November 2010, the PTC released a study, &quot;Habitat for Profanity: Broadcast TV&#x27;s Sharp Increase in Foul Language&quot;, which claims that there was a sharp rise in the usage of profanity between 2005 and 2010—during the 8 pm to 9 pm ET/PT time period commonly referred to them as the Family Viewing Hour, the PTC claimed that there were 111 instances of profanity during this hour in 2010 versus 10 in 2005; during all of prime time, 276 instances in 2010 against 11 in 2005. The study claimed that there was a 69.3% increase in prime time in general between 2005 and 2010, with the Fox network being heavily accused of bringing a 269% increase for the network during that period. The study also claimed instances in which there was profanity, but the offending word was bleeped out.

===Entertainment reviews and analysis===
The PTC&#x27;s activities extend to evaluation, rating, and educating around broadcast TV programs according to a traffic light system across three categories of sex, violence and profanity, accumulating to an overall rating based on the ratings of these three categories. The guide has been in use since the 1995–96 season using the traffic light system. In the PTC&#x27;s definition of its traffic light system, green light indicates that the program is &quot;appropriate for all ages&quot;, a yellow light indicates that the program &quot;would be unsuitable for children under the age of 14&quot;, and a red light indicates that the program is &quot;appropriate for adult audiences only&quot;.

Every television season since 1995–96, the council has released a list of the best and worst prime-time television programs for family viewing. The PTC&#x27;s website includes the guide from the 1996-97 season at the earliest. Starting with the 2005–2006 season, their list was based on their traffic light system as well as Nielsen Media Research ratings of viewership among children ages 2–17 of certain shows. Popular shows that have frequently been praised as the most family-friendly programs on television include &quot;George Lopez&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;, &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot;, &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;. Popular shows frequently named &quot;Worst of the Season&quot; include &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;House&quot;, &quot;South Park,&quot; &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot;, &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; and &quot;Will and Grace&quot;.

On a weekly basis, the PTC publishes reviews of what they consider to be the best and worst television programming for family viewing, authored by the various entertainment analysts at the council. Seth MacFarlane, creator of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, compared the PTC&#x27;s frequent negative reviews of the series to &quot;hate mail from Hitler&quot; and &quot;They&#x27;re literally terrible human beings. I&#x27;ve read their newsletter, I&#x27;ve visited their website, and they&#x27;re just rotten to the core. For an organization that prides itself on &#x27;Christian&#x27; values ... they spend their entire day hating people.&quot; MacFarlane became a target again when the PTC protested the Academy Awards&#x27; decision to have him host the 85th ceremony. &quot;So You Think You Can Rate a TV Show?&quot;, the title being a play on the title of Fox television series &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, is a weekly column the PTC began in July 2007 to claim that networks inaccurately rate their shows based on the TV Parental Guidelines, whether the network applied the improper age-based rating (such as TV-PG or TV-14) or failed to include the proper content descriptors (such as &quot;L&quot; for language or &quot;V&quot; for violence).

===Seal of Approval===
To recognize excellence in the media, the Parents Television Council awards its Seal of Approval to television shows, movies, home products, and advertisers that provide or sponsor content it deems to be &quot;family-friendly&quot;. It is divided into two categories: Entertainment and Advertiser. Popular television shows that have been awarded include &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, &quot;George Lopez&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, &quot;Reba&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, and most recently, &quot;When Calls the Heart&quot;. Also receiving the Entertainment Seal of Approval are TiVo&#x27;s KidZone television filtering service, The Jimmy Wilson Films Children&#x27;s Adventure Series, the Sky Angel Christian television service, and the CleanFlicks DVD filtering product.

==Activism==

===Broadcast indecency===
In 2003, the PTC unsuccessfully campaigned for the FCC to take action against the NBC television network in response to the use of the word &quot;&quot; by Bono, lead singer for the rock band U2, during the network&#x27;s January 2003 telecast of the Golden Globe Awards. Among an audience of nearly 20 million, the FCC received only 234 complaints, 217 of which came from the PTC. In October 2003, the FCC decided not to fine NBC because Bono&#x27;s obscenity was ruled as fleeting and not describing sexual or excretory functions, the FCC&#x27;s standard for fining a network for indecency. After the PTC filed an Application for Review to the FCC, in March 2004 the FCC decided that the word was indecent by law but still decided not to fine NBC; however, the ruling was to serve as a warning to networks that there would be a &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policy towards obscene language willfully used during the daytime. However, the PTC&#x27;s complaints about profanity used by presenter Nicole Richie in the December 10, 2003, broadcast of the &quot;Billboard Music Awards&quot; led the FCC to conclude that the language violated decency law.

The PTC began attracting more attention after it filed around 65,000 complaints to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, in which one of performer Janet Jackson&#x27;s nipple shielded breasts, was exposed for 9/16ths of a second. FCC chairman Michael Powell stated that the number of indecency complaints to the FCC had risen from 350 in the years 2000 and 2001, to 14,000 in 2002 and 240,000 in 2003. It was also found that the PTC had generated most of the indecency complaints received by the Federal Communications Commission. In July 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit voided the fine.

After the halftime show, the PTC launched five more FCC complaint drives, starting March 2004 with an episode of Fox&#x27;s &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; titled &quot;Happy Jack&quot;, which revolved around character Eric Forman being caught masturbating. The beginning of the 2004–2005 television season sparked four new campaigns, the first being against NBC&#x27;s animated series &quot;Father of the Pride&quot;, stating that it contained a &quot;barrage of sexual innuendo and profanity&quot; while being promoted &quot;from the creators of &quot;Shrek&quot;&quot;, which they felt would potentially attract children to watching the series. That campaign led to over 11,000 email complaints to the FCC. Later, shortly after CBS broadcast the word &quot;fuck&quot; during an airing of &quot;Big Brother 5&quot;, the PTC took action again, this time claiming that CBS ignored a warning from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that there would be zero tolerance toward unbleeped profanity. However, those complaints became moot when Viacom, then-owners of CBS, settled with the FCC for $3.5 million regarding all allegedly indecent programming broadcast in the years around 2003 and 2004, including the &quot;Big Brother 5&quot; episode in question. In March 2006, the FCC ruled that &quot;Father of the Pride&quot; was not indecent. Following were complaints about an October 2004 episode of ABC&#x27;s short-lived teen drama &quot;Life As We Know It&quot;, which the PTC felt was sexually charged.

The PTC started off 2005 with their campaign against the &quot;Without a Trace&quot; episode &quot;Our Sons and Daughters&quot;, leading to CBS being fined for indecency in March 2006; the PTC objected to the depiction of teenagers participating in an orgy in that episode. CBS argued that the episode &quot;featured an important and socially relevant storyline warning parents to exercise greater supervision of their teenagers.&quot; The FCC fined CBS $3.63 million in March 2006 for this episode, but after a court settlement, the network agreed to pay $300,000 in fines. At the end of January 2005, the FCC rejected a set of complaints that PTC filed between October 2001 and February 2004 for allegedly indecent programs such as NBC&#x27;s &quot;Friends&quot;, the WB&#x27;s &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, and Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The FCC received complaints from the PTC in the summer over an unedited broadcast of the lyric &quot;who the fuck are you?&quot; in The Who&#x27;s song &quot;Who Are You&quot; from the &quot;Live 8&quot; concert broadcast July 2, 2005, on ABC stations on the East Coast.

In 2006, PTC requested that the FCC deny broadcast license renewal for Salt Lake City CBS station KUTV because they felt that the broadcast of the &quot;Without a Trace&quot; episode that was ruled indecent violated community standards and that CBS failed to take action to reduce indecent content following the FCC fines. Subsequently, CBS agreed to pay the FCC $300,000 to settle the KUTV license challenge. Starting from December 2007, the organization demanded that CBS cancel its plan to rebroadcast an edited version of the Showtime drama &quot;Dexter&quot;, whose title character was a serial killer and police forensics analyst, because it felt that the program would glorify murder even with the edits. By early February 2008, the Council claimed to have collected 17,000 complaints to CBS.

On January 25, 2008, the FCC proposed an estimated $1.4 million fine against ABC for a scene of female nudity in the &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; episode &quot;Nude Awakening&quot; aired on February 25, 2003. Because the episode aired outside the indecency &quot;safe harbor&quot; in the Central and Mountain Time Zones, the fine applied only to ABC stations in those zones. The PTC praised the FCC&#x27;s action. However, PTC president Winter condemned ABC&#x27;s decision to appeal the fine in federal court. PTC has also criticized the Third Circuit Court of Appeals&#x27; decision to void the FCC&#x27;s fine for the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. TV series that the PTC has targeted for FCC complaints in 2008 have included NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; morning show and CBS primetime programs &quot;Big Brother 10&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;. Profanity was the main concern for &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Big Brother 10&quot;, the extremely brief exposure of contestant Marcus Lehman&#x27;s penis for &quot;Survivor: Gabon&quot;, and a &quot;lap-dance&quot; scene for &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;. The PTC&#x27;s first complaint in 2009 was over sexual content in an episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; titled &quot;Family Gay&quot;. Later in 2009, the PTC urged affiliates of The CW to pre-empt a &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; episode to be aired November 9; the episode would reportedly contain a threesome scene. In response to Adam Lambert&#x27;s performance of his song &quot;For Your Entertainment&quot; at the end of the 2009 American Music Awards broadcast on ABC, PTC urged viewers to complain to the FCC if living in an area where the performance was shown before 10 p.m. local time. PTC complained that the performance contained a simulation of oral sex. Lambert&#x27;s performance reportedly was broadcast around 11 p.m. Eastern and Pacific time, &quot;outside the FCC&#x27;s usual 6am-10pm time frame prohibiting the broadcast of indecent material&quot;. ABC also received about 1,500 telephoned complaints.

In January 2010, the PTC launched a complaint campaign after the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Look a Smith Horse in the Mouth&quot; aired in January 2010. The FCC fined Fox $25,000 on June 4, stating that they failed to respond to an inquiry of 100,000 complaints about the episode. A month later, Fox slammed the decision, claiming that it was &quot;unconstitutional&quot;. On May 20, 2010, the PTC announced that it plans to target CBS and its affiliates after the network announced that the new sitcom &quot;$#*! My Dad Says&quot; was added to the 2010-2011 fall TV lineup. The PTC cites both the show&#x27;s title and its Thursday 8:30 pm timeslot as reasons. The series is based on the popular Twitter account created by Justin Halpern, who also served as one of the co-producers on the show. CBS defended its decision and said that it was working with the account&#x27;s creator and its content was toned down for the program before the series premiere in September.

In October 2010, the PTC targeted an episode of the Fox series &quot;Glee&quot;, stating that the episode featured outfits that were scantily clad and guest-star Britney Spears going shopping in lingerie, calling it, &quot;an endorsement of narcotics abuse, public masturbation, and school-sanctioned burlesque.&quot; They were also criticizing it for making an episode idolizing Britney in the first place, stating: &quot;Perhaps most troubling is the deification of a troubled popstar into a symbol of empowerment and self-esteem.&quot; On October 20, PTC criticized &quot;GQ&quot; magazine for featuring three &quot;Glee&quot; stars posing in risque outfits; the PTC statement said that the photoshoot &quot;borders on pedophilia.&quot;

In January 2011, the PTC called on the United States Department of Justice and the Judiciary Committees of both houses of Congress to investigate whether MTV violated child pornography laws in casting teenaged actors in &quot;Skins&quot;, a remake of the British TV series of the same name. MTV rated &quot;Skins&quot; &quot;TV-MA&quot;, meaning the show is not suitable for audiences under 17. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; responded in an editorial: &quot;...looking for government remedies is ineffective and unwise; we suspect the network&#x27;s editors are smart enough to skirt prosecution. The Federal Communications Commission doesn&#x27;t regulate the content of cable networks, and even if it did, a crackdown on shows like &quot;Skins&quot; would be a bad idea, because adults should be able to watch whatever they like on cable and federal attempts to protect kids from adult programming have never been successful.&quot;

In August 2020, the PTC requested that Netflix remove the film &quot;Cuties&quot; from its streaming service.

===Advertising===
In May 2005 Carl&#x27;s Jr. introduced its &quot;Spicy BBQ Six Dollar Burger&quot; in a television advertisement featuring celebrity Paris Hilton in a swimsuit, soaping up a Bentley Arnage while leaning on it, and then eating the burger. A similar ad with Hilton for Hardee&#x27;s hamburger chain was aired in June 2005.
The Parents Television Council and other media watchdog groups criticized the commercial for being shown during programs that were very likely to be watched by children. Melissa Caldwell, PTC research director, said, &quot;This commercial is basically soft-core porn. The way she moves, the way she puts her finger in her mouth—it&#x27;s very suggestive and very titillating.&quot; The group mobilized more than one million members to contact the restaurant chain and voice their concern and claimed that &quot;[i]f this television commercial were to go unchallenged it would set a new standard for acceptable television commercial content.&quot; Caldwell, then-president Bozell, and then-executive director Winter appeared on various news programs such as &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The Early Show&quot;, &quot;American Morning&quot;, and &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; to discuss this issue. Andy Puzder, CEO of Carl&#x27;s Jr., says the group needs to &quot;get a life ... This isn&#x27;t Janet Jackson—there is no nipple shield in this,&quot; referring to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime-show controversy. He continued, &quot;There is no nudity, there is no sex act — it&#x27;s a beautiful model in a swimsuit washing a car.&quot; In addition to featuring the ad on their web site, Carl&#x27;s Jr. also set up another website playing a longer version of the commercial.

PTC accused television commercials for Hardee&#x27;s &quot;biscuit holes&quot; food product of suggesting double entendres. The commercial featured consumers suggesting &quot;A-holes&quot; and &quot;B-holes&quot; as nicknames for the biscuit holes. Boddie-Noell Enterprises, which owned 350 Hardee&#x27;s restaurants in four states, refused to show the ads in its respective markets. Ben Mayo Boddie, chairman of Boddie-Noell, wrote a letter to the PTC condemning the ads as well.

===World Wrestling Federation campaign and lawsuit===
In 1999, the PTC launched a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), complaining that their &quot;SmackDown!&quot; program contained levels of sexuality and violence unbecoming prime time programming. In the campaign, Bozell said that four children had been killed by peers emulating professional wrestling moves learned from the program. With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting with representatives of the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true.

On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed a lawsuit against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming that the PTC&#x27;s statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC&#x27;s motion on the basis that the WWF&#x27;s lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that it was wrong to blame the World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to blame the death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.

The PTC would be satirized in WWF programming by The Right to Censor, a group of heels led by Steven Richards who objected to rowdy, risqué, and &quot;hardcore&quot; activities.

===In-flight entertainment===
In September 2007, the PTC launched a campaign to get airlines in America to reduce the number of &quot;PG-13&quot; and &quot;R&quot;-rated films shown as in-flight entertainment. Consequently, Heath Shuler, Democratic representative of North Carolina, introduced the Family Friendly Flights Act of 2007 bill to require airlines to set aside &quot;child-safe&quot; viewing areas for families to sit in planes. The bill never became law.

===YouTube===
Twice has the PTC targeted video-hosting website YouTube in its campaigns and statements. PTC called for NBC to reconsider uploading the uncensored clip of the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; novelty song &quot;Dick in a Box&quot; on NBC&#x27;s site and YouTube channel. In 2008, the PTC released a report &quot;The &quot;New&quot; Tube: A Content Analysis of YouTube—the Most Popular Online Video Destination&quot;, which praised YouTube for filtering adult content but criticized the site for not filtering profanity and other explicit content from comments sections or videos.

===Ethics controversy===
In October 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that former PTC vice president of development Patrick W. Salazar had accused PTC of mishandling hundreds of thousands of mailings to donors and members. Based on Internal Revenue Service filings, the American Institute of Philanthropy rated PTC &quot;C+&quot; on financial efficiency. Salazar also disputed the PTC&#x27;s official membership figure of 1.3 million and estimated that at most 12,000 people respond to annual fundraisers. Although Salazar stated that he left the PTC in November 2009, the PTC said that it fired Salazar and that Salazar was trying to extort money from the organization.

===Other===
The PTC also criticized &quot;The Muppets&quot; for not meeting &quot;family viewing&quot; guidelines and suggested a boycott, based on the mockumentary format of the series including mentions of plastic surgery, &quot;inside&quot; business language being used in a crude manner, and the Muppets in a bar consuming alcoholic beverages.

The PTC also criticized WE tv&#x27;s &quot;Sex Box&quot;, deeming it &quot;an affront to families, toxic to advertisers, and a clear demonstration of a badly-broken business model that forces every cable/satellite subscriber to pay for unwanted and unwatched cable networks.&quot;

On its website, PTC states that its mission is to &quot;promote and restore responsibility and decency to the entertainment industry in answer to America&#x27;s demand for positive, family-oriented television programming.&quot; The PTC believes that the entertainment industry—not only television but also music, movies, and video games as well—and its sponsors share responsibility with parents for children&#x27;s television viewing habits. It therefore believes that television is harming children through a perceived &quot;gratuitous&quot; amount of sex, violence, and profanity. Its activism has influenced the removal of potentially objectionable content from certain shows, such as the fourth season of the popular CBS crime drama &quot;&quot;. Increased government regulation of broadcasting is another viewpoint supported by PTC. PTC considers itself nonpartisan; others have considered the PTC to be bipartisan or socially conservative. Robyn Blumner of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; called the PTC &quot;the Gladys Kravitz of public advocacy&quot; in a column of hers and believed the PTC supported a federal policy on broadcast decency she called &quot;Big Nanny run amok&quot;.

===TV Parental Guidelines===
Since the introduction of the TV Parental Guidelines ratings system, the PTC has frequently accused the guidelines of having inaccuracy and low standards. In 1997, PTC was twice as likely to rate a show with the toughest rating classification, &quot;red light&quot; in the PTC&#x27;s case, and &quot;TV-14&quot; in the Guidelines. Bill Berkowitz quoted PTC president Bozell as stating, based on PTC research, that &quot;the current ratings system and V-chip are failures.&quot; In response to a V-Chip advertising campaign in the summer of 2006, Bozell proposed instead that cable companies either apply FCC-style broadcast television standards or offer choice in ordering channels. Television Watch considers PTC&#x27;s reporting on the V-chip inaccurate and ideologically charged.

===Cable choice===

The PTC is an avid supporter of &quot;a la carte&quot; cable television services to allow families to choose only the cable television channels that are appropriate for their children, and also impose the same decency standards already in place on broadcast television on cable channels. Frequently, the council has criticized programs on BET, Comedy Central, E!, FX, MTV, Spike, TNT, and VH1 because they claim some of the content aired on those channels is inappropriate for younger viewers. On the other side of the issue, the PTC has awarded its &quot;Seal of Approval&quot; to cable networks Disney Channel and Hallmark Channel for their original programs several years ago.

On June 14, 2007, United States Representatives Dan Lipinski (Democratic, Illinois) and Jeff Fortenberry (Republican, Nebraska) introduced into legislation the Family and Consumer Choice Act of 2007, which intends to allow families to choose and pay for only the cable television channels that they want to watch. In September 2007, the PTC launched a new website, &quot;HowCableShouldBe.com&quot;, to allow cable customers to see how much they are paying for their monthly cable bill currently.

In August 2013, the PTC released a statement criticizing MTV for the airing of a performance by Miley Cyrus during its Video Music Awards and urged Congress to pass the Television Consumer Freedom Act.

==Popular music==
In April 2008, PTC released &quot;The Rap on Rap&quot;, a study covering hip-hop and R&amp;B music videos rotated on programs &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; and &quot;Rap City&quot;, both shown on BET, and &quot;Sucker Free&quot; on MTV. PTC urged advertisers to withdraw sponsorship of those programs, whose videos PTC stated targeted children and teenagers &quot;with adult content ... once every 38 seconds&quot;. PTC also warned radio stations about playing the Britney Spears song &quot;If U Seek Amy&quot; over concerns it contained an audible use of an obscenity. In response to the music video to Miley Cyrus&#x27; song &quot;Who Owns My Heart&quot;, the PTC stated that it felt it was &quot;unfortunate that she would participate in such a sexualized video like this one&quot;; ironically, Miley Cyrus&#x27; father Billy Ray Cyrus sat on the PTC Advisory Board at the time.

In May 2011, the PTC took issue with Rihanna&#x27;s music video for her song &quot;Man Down.&quot; In the video Rihanna portrays a woman who resorts to killing the man who had previously raped her. They claimed the video promoted gun crime and murder, while the pop star said she wanted to be a voice to victims. After the video became the most viewed YouTube video that week, she sarcastically used Twitter to thank the PTC in helping her make the video such a success.

==Criticism==
The PTMC has been frequently criticized for hypocrisy, slanted reporting and only criticizing shows that are aimed at adults. Critics of the PTMC have alleged that it supports increased governmental censorship of television by lobbying the FCC for indecency enforcement for certain television shows and inaccurately reporting on the V-Chip in order to further their agenda.

&quot;Family Guy&quot; creator Seth MacFarlane, who the PTMC frequently criticizes, said in &quot;The Advocate&quot;

Kurt Sutter, creator of &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; responded to Bozell&#x27;s article that attacked the season 6 premiere of his show due to it including a school shooting scene, calling the PTC &quot;a hate club&quot; and Bozell an &quot;idiot&quot; as well as &quot;a pathetic fucking douchebag and I bet your own kids fucking hate you.”

In January 2005, Bahçeşehir University associate professor Christian Christiansen questioned the backgrounds of certain PTC Advisory Board members, contending they are not consistent with their stance on morality. Christiansen&#x27;s observations were as follows: L. Brent Bozell III as &#x27;National Finance Chairman for the 1992 &quot;Buchanan for President&quot; campaign&#x27; of &quot;neo-fascist Pat Buchanan&quot;; Susan Howard&#x27;s portrayal of adulterous Donna Culver Krebbs on TV series &quot;Dallas&quot;, which series &quot;was soaked in scantily-clad women, emotional cruelty, violence, alcoholism, and marital infidelity&quot;; Coleman Luck as &#x27;writer and producer&#x27; ... &#x27;on &quot;Otherworld&quot;, &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s Fire&quot;, &quot;Matrix&quot;, and &quot;The Burning Zone&quot; [which] ... included a fair amount of death and violence&#x27;; William Bennett as &quot;a popular guest at a number of Las Vegas casinos&quot;; Bruce Jarchow appearing in &quot;less family-friendly products... such as &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Mad Dog and Glory&quot; and &quot;Married... with Children&quot;; Billy Ray Cyrus, who starred in &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; made by filmmaker David Lynch; and John Carvelli, &#x27;who, in 1987, &quot;took part in a fact-finding mission in Nicaragua and Honduras with the National Conservative Foundation during the Nicaraguan civil war.&quot;&#x27;

In a December 2005 column of his, &quot;Advertising Age&quot; columnist Simon Dumenco claimed that the PTC is &quot;very very afraid of gay TV characters&quot;. &quot;Culture Watch&quot; columnist Christopher Gildemeister defended the PTC as being &quot;not homophobic&quot; but simply opposed to &quot;sexual references or innuendo (of any variety, hetero, homo or other) aired where children might be exposed to them.&quot;

Historically farmers, a small number of Reer Barre are pastoralist, mostly keeping cows and goats and are usually residents of eastern cities of Ethiopia, such as Jijiga, Gode, Kelafo, Far-libah, Feerfeer, Mustahiil, along with more cities and towns in different parts of the Somali Regional state of Ethiopia. These tribes are unknown to the government of Ethiopia so far, regardless of the country&#x27;s ethnic based federalism who has no stock of its ethnic group. They are a large family who also have a large population in the Shabelle region, Somalia. &quot;Reer&quot; means &quot;family&quot; and &quot;Barre&quot; is a name, altogether meaning &quot;Barre family&quot;. They are descendants of Barre Abdille.

== Language and origins ==

Their unattested but apparently non-Somali language seems to have been first mentioned in print by Lionel Bender in 1975:

Others have linked the Reer Barre to the Bantu language family, implying that they may be the remnants of a Bantu-speaking pre-Somali population or, like the &quot;Somali Bantu&quot; in the Jubba River valley of southern Somalia, the descendants of Bantu slaves imported from other parts of East Africa in the 19th century, but this one seems to be false. Tobias Hagmann refers to them as &quot;Somalised Bantu&quot;. According to Ulrich Braukämper:

A British hunter, Colonel Swayne, who visited Imi in February 1893, relates that he was the guest of Gabba Oboho, a chief of the Adona, for several days.

Reer Shabeele clan is also divided into 9 sub-clans including Isse, Gasar, Ali Maad, Duube digil, Baajimaal Mohammed, Maadle Guuled, Dagiine Digil, Geedow Ahmed, Muddora&#x27;do.

<text>Jacqueline Mars (born October 10, 1939) is an American heiress and investor. She is the daughter of Audrey Ruth (Meyer) and Forrest Mars Sr., and the granddaughter of Franklin Clarence Mars, founders of the American candy company Mars Inc. the &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot; estimated her net worth at US$46.6 billion, ranking her the 23rd-richest person in the world. In the annual ranking of the richest women in the world in 2023, Forbes estimated her fortune at $38.3 billion and placed her in fourth place.

== Early life ==
Jacqueline Mars was born on October 10, 1939. She was graduated from Miss Hall&#x27;s School in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Mars participated as an equestrian in many horse shows during her youth. She is a 1961 graduate of Bryn Mawr College and her degree is in anthropology.

== Career ==
Mars is an heiress among the members of the Mars family that founded and owns Mars Incorporated, holding shares in the company. As a member of the family, her shares of Mars, Inc. and other assets were estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in April 2024 to be worth $38.5 billion, making her the 19th richest American, and #34 on its list of &quot;The World&#x27;s Billionaires&quot;. Mars was active in Mars, Inc. from 1982, when she joined the company as food product group president. She spent the majority of her time working for the Mars Foundation, a philanthropic nonprofit supported by the company. She retired in 2001. In June 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed her as the wealthiest resident living in Virginia, with an estimated $28.1 billion net worth.

=== 2013 automobile crash ===
On October 4, 2013, at the age of 74, Mars was involved in a car crash on U.S. Route 50 in Aldie, near her home in The Plains in Northern Virginia. Her vehicle crossed the highway center line and struck a Chrysler minivan carrying six passengers. One person died at the scene and another, who was pregnant, subsequently miscarried. Mars was charged with reckless driving. She told a witness after the crash that she had fallen asleep at the wheel. Mars subsequently pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge of reckless driving, with tests having revealed no drugs, alcohol, or medications in her system that could have caused a blackout.

== Philanthropy ==
She sits on the board of directors for both the Washington National Opera and the National Sporting Library and Fine Arts Museum. Mars also sits on the National Advisory Council of the Journey through Hallowed Ground, a foundation promoting American heritage in the region stretching from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson that is situated just outside Charlottesville, Virginia. 

Mars is a routine donor to the League of Conservation Voters. She has also donated to the National Air and Space Museum, the Washington Performing Arts Society. She received the inaugural Heritage Award granted by the Foundation for the National Archives.

<doc id="1251123" wikidata="Q5288243" url="?curid=1251123" title="Dog aggression">
<text>Dog aggression expressed by dogs is considered to be normal behaviour and various types of aggression are influenced by a dog&#x27;s environment and genetic predisposition. Dogs commonly display possessive aggression when defending resources or themselves.

Canine aggression may be influenced by a dog&#x27;s age, sex, health and reproductive status. Canine aggression is one of the most serious behavior problems in animal behavioral medical science. Aggression in canines is particularly important because a dog&#x27;s sharp teeth can result in serious injuries, or even fatalities in the young or frail.

The determinants for each type of aggression are different, but there are specific factors that are common to canine aggression. The types of aggression include dominance aggression, defensive aggression, predatory aggression and maternal aggression. Aggression in canines may be a self-defense response to a person or animal entering a dog&#x27;s space, which may be ritualized aggression, not actual aggression, if the violation includes a threat. Aggressive behavior in scared dogs is typically not true aggression but rather ritualized behavior intended to avoid physical altercation by way of faking aggression rather than actual aggression, anxiety disorder, diet, gut microbiome or genetic background. Some aggression can be treated through animal behaviour therapy or avoided by proper socialization during puppyhood.

== Types of aggression ==

=== Dominance aggression ===
1) Punishing dogs has been associated with a strong likelihood of new or increased aggression and other behavior problems; 2) dominance in pet dogs is not a character trait of a dog but rather a power agreement between dogs regarding who has best access to particular resources; and 3) the behavior of dogs controlling access to resources is fluid, not static, depending on context. There is also data suggesting that the concept of spoiling a dog is often a misnomer, that this perceived spoiling is often a matter of meeting the dog&#x27;s emotional and physical needs.

=== Defensive aggression ===
Defensive aggression, also known as fear aggression or avoidance-motivated aggression, occurs when an individual approaches and interacts with a human-avoidant dog. The dog might first try to flee, but may resort to aggressive behavior if cornered, as a means to try to defend itself from a real or perceived threat. The dog displays aggressive behavior in an attempt to avoid a real or perceived negative consequence, such as to avoid pain. Dogs may display a multitude of behaviors leading up to an attack including fear and stress signals, defensive posturing, facial expressions, or no signals at all. Signals are generally different for self-defensive dogs versus those who are truly aggressive, as in competitive aggression.

Tortora in 1983 experimented with a shock therapy to retrain avoidance-motivated aggressive dogs to condition them with safety cues, a process which he called Safety Training. He wrote that this therapy, when successful, had long-term benefit for the dog and its owners.

=== Predatory aggression ===

Predatory aggression is usually seen as part of the prey drive sequence starting with a visual or auditory trigger followed by chase, capture and kill. Predatory aggression is impacted by anxious influences, which results in the expression of affective aggression. This type of aggression is caused by sympathetic system activation and is non-affective. Based on a study that examines the predatory aggression in German shepherd dogs, this type of aggression is rarely displayed by dogs. However, if it does occur, it is usually directed towards unfamiliar dogs. Furthermore, predatory behavior activates reward centers in the central nervous system. According to Gonzalo and colleagues, this type of behavior is rewarding and therefore difficult to change. Predatory aggression is displayed by mature and intact males and this type of aggression results in serious damage to others. It includes actions such as chasing, biting, catching and may involve death or injury.
=== Maternal aggression ===
Maternal aggression is displayed by mothers when they are approached and particularly when their offspring are young. This type of aggression is linked to pain such as in cases of mastitis. Oxytocin plays an important role in the early bonding between the mother and her offspring. Dogs with maternal aggressiveness are protective of their offspring and nest. The change in hormone is linked to lactation, and the mothers can change the dogs&#x27; perception and assessment . Maternal aggression may lead to bites or other attacks. Maternal aggressiveness affects the growth and socialization of puppies. Furthermore, this type of aggression may stem from unstable social environments. Maternal dogs are very protective of their puppies and their aggressive tendencies decreases as their offspring grow up and they are able to defend themselves.

==Causes==

=== Gut microbiome ===

The gut microbiome is linked to numerous health problems such as diarrhea and bowel disease, which results in pain and can possibly lead to aggression. The gut microbiome affects the affective disorders such as anxiety, which contribute to canine aggression. Based on a study carried out by Kirchoff and colleagues, the composition of gut microbiome differs on the basis of aggressive and non-aggressive assessments. In this study, the researchers tested rescued dogs that possessed aggressive and non aggressive behavior. The dogs were tested in the same environment, ate the same diet, and were consistent breed type, but variation was still present in the gut microbiome. The results of this study show the difference and abundance in lineages in aggressive and non-aggressive groups, indicating that an aggressive dog displays physiological conditions in their gut, which affects the composition of the gut microbiome. It also shows that the gut microbiome is associated with aggressive behavior. &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; are present in the guts of dogs that exhibit aggressive behavior, even though strains of &quot;Lactobacillus rhamnosus&quot; reduce stress and anxiety in mice. However, &quot;Fusobacterium&quot; is present in the stool sample of dogs that display non-aggressive behavior, even though it is known to evoke pro-inflammatory effects of gut microbiome.

=== Anxiety ===
Some aggression stems from generalized anxiety. The dog cannot determine the difference between a legitimate and false threat. Some signs of anxiety include dilated pupils, constant yawning and lip licking, ears pulled back, trembling, tail tucked and lowered body or head. An anxious dog may pace or be unable to relax even when there is no threat present.

Anxiety screening was used in behavioral evaluation of children-directed aggressive behavior in dogs and according to Reisner and colleagues, 77% of animals displayed abnormalities. Aggressive behavior in dogs is often associated with fear, the separation from their owner, or noise sensitivity, all of which may result in or contribute to anxiety disorder.

=== Fear ===
In a study that examines the prevalence, comorbidity, and behavioral variation in canine anxiety, owners of fearful dogs reported that their dogs demonstrate behaviors they consider aggressive, such as barking and growling, to strangers and other dogs. The owners of 673 dogs noted that their dogs express fear by barking, and growling. The presence of aggression in dogs is associated with defense mechanism. Based on this study, there was an increase in bites towards strangers and familiar people when the self-defense response was not heeded, such as by cornering an avoidant dog. However, Abrantes points out that aggressive behavior in dogs is behavior that causes pain or injury, and HSUS explains that barking and growling are normal communicative behaviors for dogs not necessarily indicative of aggression.

=== Breed, socialization, and health status ===

It is important to recognize that aggression is displayed more in certain breeds, which indicates the influence of genetic background on aggression in dogs. According to Roll and Unshelm, German Shepherd dogs and Bull Terriers are more likely to display violent behavior to others. Voith and Borchelt found that higher incidences of aggressive behavior were displayed in purebred dogs when compared with mixed breed dogs. Often, aggression in adult dogs is usually a result of little to no contact in early life. In other words, as a result of missed early socialization, a dog will not know how to interact with others, how to follow rules or how to adapt to new environments. Aggressive behavior is more prominent in intact males when compared with neutered males and in sterilized females than intact females. According to Hoerlein, the removal of a male&#x27;s testicles has significant impact on aggressive and dominant males. Neoplasia of the central nervous system, infectious diseases, developmental and metabolic disorders may impact aggression in dogs. Many of these illnesses can cause aggressive and violent behavior, especially when located in the frontal cortex, the hypothalamus, the thalamus, the amygdaloid body, the medial mammillary, the nucleus, the habenular nuclei, the hippocampus and the caudate nucleus.

== Research ==
=== Gonadectomy ===
Gonadectomy is used to treat aggressive behavior of dogs. Farhoody and colleagues carried out a study to determine the impact of gonadectomy on the aggressive behavior of dogs using the Canine Behavioral Assessment Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). According to the data collected, gonadectomized dogs between the ages of 7 and 12 months were more likely to be aggressive to strangers.

Furthermore, gonadectomized dogs of all ages do not display violent behavior to familiar people or strangers. The data does not show that gonadectomy prevent or treat aggressive behavior of dogs.

Based on McMillan and colleagues’ research, aggressive behavior was prominent in dogs obtained from pet stores.  Guy and colleagues found that environmental factors directly contributed to aggression in dogs. For instance, a dog that lives in a home with an adolescent or has a skin disorder is more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior to familiar people and strangers.

Roll and Unshelm believed that the reason for buying or adopting a dog was a significant factor that correlated with aggression. They also argued that the relationship between the owner and dog determined whether or not the dog would exhibit aggressive behavior. For instance, the owner&#x27;s attitude towards training, or physical mistreatment endured by the dog at the hands of the owner resulted in aggressive behavior towards others. Many factors impact the aggressive behavior displayed by dogs.

=== Reactivity to stimuli ===
According to Arata and colleagues, reactivity to stimuli is involved in various types of aggression. The researchers used a questionnaire survey to assess approximately 5000 dogs of 17 breeds. In this study, a factor analysis was used to extract five consistent factors in 14 of the 17 breeds. Using 14 behavioral items, the researchers were able to see the consistent presence of these factors in dogs, indicating that these factors are linked to canine aggression.

The collected data and the established factor system indicated that the French Bulldog, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Golden Retriever, and Labrador Retriever did not display aggressive behavior. However, the Chihuahua and Miniature Dachshund were more aggressive and more likely to chase others.

Based on this study, reactivity to stimuli was linked to owner-directed aggressive behavior in 13 different breeds, child-directed aggressive behavior in eight different breeds, stranger-directed aggressive behavior in nine breeds and dog-directed aggressive behavior in five breeds. In this study, dogs that are highly reactive to stimuli were either uneasy and reacted to all movements or less engaged and overreacted to unexpected stimuli.

The association between canine aggression and sociability with humans and likeliness to chase were examined. Sociability with humans was linked to child-, stranger-, and dog-directed aggressive behavior in more than seven breeds. Moreover, likeliness to chase was primarily linked to dog-directed aggressive behavior in 10 breeds and dogs that were more likely to chase smaller animals displayed aggressive behavior when interacting with other dogs. Reactivity to stimuli was proven to be an underlying temperamental factor that leads to canine aggression.

Other work has detailed how external stimuli significantly influences the experience of dog walking, sometimes “extracting a considerable social and emotional toll” for dog walkers.

== Treatment ==

Treatment differs for each circumstance, and treatment plans are based heavily on the type of aggression. Based on Judith Blackshaw&#x27;s study, dogs exhibited dominance aggression towards familiar people and therefore suggested obedience training as the proper treatment. According to a study conducted in 1983 by Tortora, avoidance based aggression was treated by conditioning the dog to a safety tone, this resulted in a complete elimination of the aggressive behavior for the duration of the dogs lives. Aggression can also be reduced in adult dogs during their socialization period as a puppy. Studies show that exposing puppies to their new owners and homing before 8 weeks can drastically reduce aggression later in life. However, it is still imperative for an owner to train their dog every day for a minimum of 10 minutes. More specifically, it is recommended for males to be neutered as this ensures that inherited aggression will not be passed on. It is suggested to use synthetic progestins with castration to reduce and eliminate aggressive behavior in dogs. Predatory and intermale aggression is inherent and related to testosterone secretion and as a result restrain, castration and the use of progestins are essential in reducing aggression in dogs. Some studies suggest that aversive means of control and training contribute to new and increased aggression rather than reduce it.

<text>Sergio Ramírez Mercado (; born 5 August 1942 in Masatepe, Nicaragua) is a Nicaraguan writer and intellectual who was a key figure in 1979 revolution, served in the leftist Government Junta of National Reconstruction and as vice president of the country 1985–1990 under the presidency of Daniel Ortega. He has been described as Nicaragua&#x27;s &quot;best-known living writer&quot;. Since the 1990s, he has been involved in the left-wing opposition to the Nicaraguan government, in particular in the Movimiento de Renovación Sandinista. He was exiled from the country in 2021 and stripped of his nationality by the government in 2023.

==Life and career==
Born in Masatepe in 1942, he published his first book, &quot;Cuentos&quot;, in 1963. He received his law degree from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Nicaragua of León in 1964, where he obtained the Gold Medal for being the best student.
In 1977 Ramírez became head of the &quot;Group of Twelve&quot;, a group of prominent intellectuals, priests, businesspeople, and members of civil society who publicly stated their support for the Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional (FSLN) in its struggle to topple the Presidency of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. The Group were forced into exile in Costa Rica, but their return was one of the key events heralding the end of the Somoza government. With the triumph of the Revolution in 1979, he became part of the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction, where he presided over the National Council of Education. He was elected vice-president of Nicaragua in 1984 and was sworn in 1985.

Though the FSLN lost power to the UNO coalition headed by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in 1990, Ramírez continued to serve as the leader of the Sandinista block in the National Assembly until 1995, when he founded the Movimiento de Renovación Sandinista (MRS) because of his differences with other leaders of the FSLN, such as former president Daniel Ortega, on issues of democratic reform. He has since become retrospectively critical of certain Sandinista policies that he views as having turned the country against the FSLN.

He made an unsuccessful bid for president on the MRS ticket in 1996. Since then, Ramírez has retired definitively from politics and his literary work has gained international recognition and his novels have been translated into several languages. He recently won the &quot;Carlos Fuentes&quot; prize, awarded by Mexico, in recognition of his life long work. During this period, he lived in Managua but traveled extensively.
He married his wife, Gertrudis &quot;Tulita&quot; Guerrero Mayorga, in 1964. He has three children: Sergio, María, and Dorel and eight grandchildren.In June 2021, he was forced into exile during repression of the opposition in the lead-up to the 2021 Nicaraguan general election; the government issued a warrant for his arrest in September. In February 2023, the Nicaraguan government stripped him, along with 93 other people, of his nationality. The United Nations Refugee Agency called the move &quot;arbitrary&quot; and said &quot;[t]he exercise of fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, freedom of assembly or other rights associated with a person’s political views, can never justify the deprivation of nationality.&quot;

His home in Masatepe was seized by Nicaraguan authorities on July 1, 2023.

===Writings===
Ramírez began his literary career as a short story writer. His first story, &quot;The student&quot;, was published in 1960 in &quot;Ventana&quot;, a magazine in León. His first book, published three years later, was a collection of stories, but the following, published in 1970, was a full-length novel. Since then, he has alternated these genres with essays and journalism. His international breakthrough came in 1998 when he won the Alfaguara Prize with his novel &quot;Margarita, How Beautiful the Sea&quot;.

In 1990, he founded &quot;La Quincena&quot;, a political journal based in Managua that would be published for ten years. He is presently a columnist for &quot;La Prensa&quot; as well as several newspapers around the world, including &quot;El País&quot;, &quot;La Jornada&quot;, &quot;El Nacional&quot;, &quot;El Tiempo&quot; and &quot;La Opinión&quot;. He is also the Director of &quot;Carátula&quot;, a Central American cultural e-magazine.

In January 2000, he was awarded the first &quot;José María Arguedas Narrative Prize&quot; from the Casa de las Américas. He has taught at the University of Maryland from 1999 to 2000 and again in 2001, and has been visiting professor at various major universities in the United States and Europe. He is also the President of , the most important literary festival in the region.

On 16 November 2017, Ramírez won the Spanish Ministry of Culture&#x27;s Cervantes Prize, the most prestigious literary prize in the Spanish-speaking world.

In 2018, the Council of Ministers of Spain granted Spanish citizenship to Ramírez.

In February 2023, Ramírez was stripped of Nicaraguan citizenship by the Nicaraguan authorities.

His 2021 novel, &quot;Tongolele no sabía bailar&quot; (&quot;Tongolele Didn’t Know How to Dance&quot;) is a detective novel examining the 2018 protests. Copies of the book were seized by Nicaraguan customs officials.

<text>Sangju National University was a public university in Gajang-dong, in the city of Sangju, North Gyeongsang province. In 2008 it merged with Kyungpook National University, becoming its Sangju Campus. It has an enrollment of about 4,350 students, and employs about 105 professors. The university places a heavy emphasis on agricultural studies. It is home to a graduate school, library, museum, and various technical research institutes.

Sangju National University opened on April 25, 1921, as Sangju Public School for Agriculture and Sericulture (상주공립농잠학교). The name changed at various times thereafter, but the school did not gain college status until much later. It was redesignated as Sangju Technical College in 1982, and became a university in 1999.

The school&#x27;s current president is Kim Jong-ho. The school carries out &quot;sister school&quot; relationships with Ball State University in the United States, and Benguet State University in the Philippines.

<text>Robert Doisneau (; 14 April 1912 – 1 April 1994) was a French photographer. From the 1930s, he photographed the streets of Paris. He was a champion of humanist photography and, with Henri Cartier-Bresson, a pioneer of photojournalism.

Doisneau is known for his 1950 image &quot;Le baiser de l&#x27;hôtel de ville&quot; (&quot;The Kiss by the City Hall&quot;), a photograph of a couple kissing on a busy Parisian street.

He was appointed a &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the Legion of Honour in 1984 by then French president, François Mitterrand.

==Photographic career==
Doisneau is remembered for his modest, playful, and ironic images of amusing juxtapositions, mingling social classes, and eccentrics in contemporary Paris streets and cafes. Influenced by the work of André Kertész, Eugène Atget, and Henri Cartier-Bresson, in more than twenty books of photography, he presented a charming vision of human frailty and life as a series of quiet, incongruous moments.
Doisneau&#x27;s work gives unusual prominence and dignity to children&#x27;s street culture; returning again and again to the theme of children at play in the city, unfettered by parents. His work treats their play with seriousness and respect.

==Early life==
Doisneau&#x27;s father, a plumber, died on active service in World War I, when his son was about four. His mother died when he was seven. He then was raised by an aunt. At thirteen, he enrolled at the École Estienne, a craft school from which he graduated in 1929 with diplomas in engraving and lithography. There he had his first contact with the arts, taking classes in figure drawing and still life.

When he was 16, he took up amateur photography, but was reportedly so shy that he started by photographing cobble-stones before progressing to children and then adults.

At the end of the 1920s, Doisneau found work as a draughtsman (lettering artist) in the advertising industry at &quot;Atelier Ullmann&quot; (&quot;Ullmann Studio&quot;), a creative graphics studio that specialised in the pharmaceutical industry. Here he took an opportunity to change career by also acting as camera assistant in the studio and then becoming a staff photographer.

==Photography in the 1930s==
In 1931, he left both the studio and advertising, taking a job as an assistant with the modernist photographer André Vigneau. In 1932, he sold his first photographic story to &quot;Excelsior&quot; magazine.

In 1934, he began working as an industrial advertising photographer for the Renault car factory at Boulogne-Billancourt. Working at Renault increased Doisneau&#x27;s interest in working with photography and people. Five years later, in 1939, he was dismissed because he was constantly late. He was forced to try freelance advertising, engraving, and postcard photography to earn his living. At that time, the French postcard industry was the largest in Europe, postcards served as greetings cards as well as vacation souvenirs. In 1991, he said that the years at the Renault car factory marked &quot;the beginning of his career as a photographer and the end of his youth.&quot;

In 1939, he was later hired by Charles Rado of the Rapho photographic agency and traveled throughout France in search of picture stories. This is where he took his first professional street photographs.

==War service and resistance==
Doisneau worked at the Rapho agency until the outbreak of World War II, whereupon he was drafted into the French army as both a soldier and photographer. He was in the army until 1940 and, from then until the end of the war in 1945, used his draughtsmanship, lettering artistry, and engraving skills to forge passports and identification papers for the French Resistance.

==Post-war photography==

Some of Doisneau&#x27;s most memorable photographs were taken after the war. He returned to freelance photography and sold photographs to &quot;Life&quot; and other international magazines. He briefly joined the Alliance Photo Agency but rejoined the Rapho agency in 1946 and remained with them throughout his working life, despite receiving an invitation from Henri Cartier-Bresson to join Magnum Photos.

His photographs never ridiculed the subjects; thus he refused to photograph women whose heads had been shaved as punishment for sleeping with Germans.

In 1948, he was contracted by &quot;Vogue&quot; to work as a fashion photographer. The editors believed he would bring a fresh and more casual look the magazine but Doisneau did not enjoy photographing beautiful women in elegant surroundings; he preferred street photography. When he could escape from the studio, he photographed in the Paris streets.

Le Groupe des XV was established in 1946 in Paris to promote photography as art and drawing attention to the preservation of French photographic heritage, and Doisneau joined in 1950 and participated alongside Rene-Jacques, Willy Ronis, and Pierre Jahan. After the group was disbanded, he joined the less exclusive and more militant Les 30 x 40, the Club Photographique de Paris.

The 1950s were Doisneau&#x27;s peak, but the 1960s were his wilderness years. In the 1970s, Europe began to change and editors looked for new reportage that would show the sense of a new social era. All over Europe, the old-style picture magazines were closing as television gained the public&#x27;s attention. Doisneau continued to work, producing children&#x27;s books, advertising photography, and celebrity portraits including Alberto Giacometti, Jean Cocteau, Fernand Léger, Georges Braque, and Pablo Picasso.

Doisneau worked with writers and poets such as Blaise Cendrars and Jacques Prévert, and he credited Prevert with giving him the confidence to photograph the everyday street scenes that most people simply ignored.

The photography of Doisneau has had a revival since his death in 1994. Many of his portraits and photographs of Paris from the end of World War II through the 1950s have been turned into calendars and postcards, and have become icons of French life.

== &quot;Le Baiser de l&#x27;hôtel de ville&quot; (&quot;The Kiss&quot;) ==
In 1950 Doisneau created his most recognizable work for &quot;Life&quot; – (&quot;Kiss by the Hôtel de Ville&quot;), a photograph of a couple kissing in the busy streets of Paris, which became an internationally recognised symbol of young love in Paris. It was published on 12 June 1950, part of a photo-essay on couples kissing in Paris. The identity of the couple remained a mystery until 1992.

Jean and Denise Lavergne erroneously believed themselves to be the couple in &quot;The Kiss&quot;, and when Robert and Annette Doisneau (his older daughter and also his assistant at the time) met them for lunch in the 1980s he &quot;did not want to shatter their dream&quot; so he said nothing. This resulted in them taking him to court for &quot;taking their picture without their knowledge&quot;, because under French law an individual owns the rights to their own likeness. The court action forced Doisneau to reveal that he posed the shot using Françoise Delbart and Jacques Carteaud, lovers whom he had just seen kissing, but had not photographed initially because of his natural reserve; he approached them and asked if they would repeat the kiss. He won the court case against the Lavergnes. Doisneau said in 1992: &quot;I would never have dared to photograph people like that. Lovers kissing in the street, those couples are rarely legitimate.&quot;
The couple in &quot;Le baiser&quot; were Françoise Delbart, 20, and Jacques Carteaud, 23, both aspiring actors. In 2005, Françoise Bornet (née Delbart) stated: &quot;He told us we were charming, and asked if we could kiss again for the camera. We didn&#x27;t mind. We were used to kissing. We were doing it all the time then, it was delicious. Monsieur Doisneau was adorable, very low key, very relaxed.&quot; They posed at the Place de la Concorde, the Rue de Rivoli and finally the Hôtel de Ville. The photograph was published on 12 June 1950, issue of &quot;Life&quot;. The relationship between Delbart and Carteaud only lasted for nine months. Delbart continued her acting career, but Carteaud gave up acting to become a wine producer.

In 1950, Françoise Bornet was given an original print of the photograph, bearing Doisneau&#x27;s signature and stamp, as part of the payment for her &quot;work&quot;. In April 2005, she sold the print at auction for €155,000 to an unidentified Swiss collector via the Paris auctioneers Artcurial Briest-Poulain-Le Fur.

Carteaud died in 2006, and Bornet died on Christmas Day 2023, aged 93.

==Personal life==
In 1936, Doisneau married Pierrette Chaumaison whom he had met in 1934 when she was cycling through a village where he was on holiday. The couple had two daughters, Annette (b. 1942) and Francine (b. 1947). From 1979 until his death, Annette worked as his assistant.

His wife died in 1993 suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Doisneau died six months later in 1994, having had a triple heart bypass and was suffering from acute pancreatitis. Annette said: &quot;We won in the courts (re: &quot;The Kiss&quot;), but my father was deeply shocked. He discovered a world of lies, and it hurt him. &quot;The Kiss&quot; ruined the last years of his life. Add that to my mother suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s, and I think it&#x27;s fair to say he died of sadness.&quot;

Doisneau was in many ways a shy and humble man, similar to his photography, still delivering his own work at the height of his fame. He chastised Francine for charging an &quot;indecent&quot; daily fee of £2,000 for his work on a beer advertising campaign – he wanted only the rate of an &quot;artisan photographer&quot;.
He lived in southern Paris (Gentilly, Val-de-Marne, Montrouge, and the 13th arrondissement) throughout his life. He is buried in the cemetery at Raizeux beside his wife.

<text>The Yeni language is an extinct language of Cameroon, formerly spoken around Djeni Mountain in the Nyalang area. All that remains of the language, apparently, is a song remembered by some Sandani speakers. However, according to Bruce Connell (the first linguist to report its existence, in 1995), comparison of the song&#x27;s words to neighboring languages suggests that &quot;it was closely related to [the Mambiloid languages] Cambap, Njerep, and Kasabe.&quot;

<doc id="1251143" wikidata="Q1401752" url="?curid=1251143" title="Vernaccia di San Gimignano">
<text>Vernaccia di San Gimignano is a white Italian wine, made from the Vernaccia grape, produced in and around the Italian hill town of San Gimignano, in Tuscany. It was the first Italian wine to be awarded &quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) status in 1966; on July 9, 1993, it was upgraded to &quot;denominazione di origine controllata e garantita&quot; (DOCG).

==History==
The earliest recorded mention of the wine appears in the archives of record of San Gimignano from 1276. Due to the difficulties in cultivating the Vernaccia grape, the wine fell out of favor in the early 20th century as the more prolific Trebbiano and Malvasia grapes were planted. By the 1960s, Vernaccia di San Gimignano experienced a resurgence as its distinctive, crisp qualities established it as a popular alternative to the blander wines produced from Trebbiano and Malvasia blends.

==Viticulture and winemaking==
The name &quot;Vernaccia&quot; is applied to several different Italian grapes, such as the Sardinian grape used in &quot;Vernaccia di Oristano&quot; and the Marche grape used in the sparkling red wine &quot;Vernaccia di Serrapetrona&quot;. Ampelographers have determined that the variety grown in San Gimignano is different and distinct from the other Italian Vernaccias and is probably not related. The Tuscan variety is believed to be the oldest grape variety but its origins are not clear with ampelographers disagreeing if it originally came from Eastern Europe, Greece or is indigenous to the Italian peninsula.

In San Gimignano, the Vernaccia grapes planted in sandstone based vineyards tend to produce the best examples of Vernaccia di San Gimignano. The medium altitude of the vines is approximately 280 meters and the earth is pliocene, made up of jellow sand and sandy clay. The time in which the grape harvest takes place is roughly from September 15 to October 15, with a yield of 90 quintals of grapes per hectare.

The wine is characteristically dry with crisp acidity and a slightly bitter and somewhat metallic finish. Most consider Vernaccia di San Gimignano to be a simple, everyday white; its popularity being owed less to what is in the glass and more to it being the local wine of San Gimignano, one of Tuscany&#x27;s most touristy towns. Despite this reputation, modern winemaking has introduced the use of oak aging to give the wine another layer of complexity and roundness. While very different from the historic style of Vernaccia di San Gimignano, the success of these more modern and international styles has not yet been established.

These are the characteristics for Vernaccia di San Gimignano:
* Color: yellow straw-like hue, tending towards a golden color with age
* Scent: light and penetrating
* Taste: dry, with a slightly bitter after taste
* Sugar: max. residue 4 g/l
* Total acidity: min. 5 g/l
* Dry extract: net min. 15 g/l
* Alcoholic grade: min. 11%. For the &quot;Riserva&quot; 11.50%.

According to DOC regulations, Vernaccia di San Gimignano must contain 90% Vernaccia, with up to 10% other nonaromatic approved white varieties. In order to meet &quot;riserva&quot; status, ageing must be a minimum of twelve months, including four months in bottle.

==Vernaccia in literature==
Vernaccia is mentioned by Dante Alighieri (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; XXIV) as leading to Pope Martin IV&#x27;s gluttony. He ate Bolsena eels pickled in the wine. 
Vernaccia was also praised by Francesco Redi in his work, &quot;Baccio in Toscana&quot; (1685)..

Vernaccia is mentioned by Cecco Angiolieri in an untitled poem: &quot;--S&#x27;i&#x27; gli avvessi chèsto di vernaccia!--&quot;.

<text>Vernaccia is a white wine grape that is found in many Italian wines but is most commonly associated the Tuscan wine Vernaccia di San Gimignano. Ampelographers have determined that the Vernaccia vine has many clonal varieties but is unrelated to some Italian vines known as &quot;Vernaccia&quot; such as the Sardinian varieties used in the Sherry-like wine &quot;Vernaccia di Oristano&quot;, the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol red wine grape known as Vernatsch or the black grape used in the red sparkling wine of the Marche &quot;Vernaccia di Serrapetrona&quot;. A possible reason for this is that the root of the name Vernaccia translates to different Italian vernaculars and other languages (such as German and Sardinian) and can apply to any local grape.

==History==
The Tuscan variety of Vernaccia appears to be an ancient variety but ampelographers disagree as to whether the grape&#x27;s origins are Eastern European, Greek or Roman. In the Middle Ages, a Vernaccia wine known as &quot;Vernage&quot; was popular in London.

==Wine style==
The white wine grape of Vernaccia di San Gimignano is the most well known variety of Vernaccia and produces crisp wine with good acidity and citrus fruit. It is sometimes blended with Trebbiano but is also seen as a varietal wine.

==Other varieties==
The Sardinian Vernaccia of &quot;Vernaccia di Oristano&quot; is known as Vernaccia di Oristano. Two other wines that were available in Sardinia in the 1960s were Sardinian Gold and Sardinian Silver. The Marche grape of &quot;Vernaccia di Serrapetrona&quot; is Vernaccia Nera.

<doc id="1251153" wikidata="Q1179137" url="?curid=1251153" title="Monty Python's Flying Circus (album)">
<text>Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus is the first album produced by the Monty Python troupe, released in both the UK and US in 1970, with the US version featuring a back cover slightly different from the original UK version. It features newly recorded versions of sketches from the first &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; television series.

Next to the television show itself, the album was the first piece of media the Pythons released. It is noted that Terry Gilliam was not included as a member of Python on the album&#x27;s cast listing (in spite of his brief appearance in the sketch &quot;The Visitors&quot;) and Graham Chapman&#x27;s name is misspelled &quot;Grahame&quot;.

The album was recorded on a single day, 2 May 1970, in front of a live audience at the Camden Theatre in London. Recalling the rather muted response, Eric Idle would later claim &quot;they were a particularly dead audience.&quot;

The copyright to the record is still owned by the BBC, making it one of the few pieces of material the Pythons themselves do not own. This is also the reason why it did not gain a 2006 special edition release. One of the tracks makes specific mention to the album being in stereo, and Chapman demonstrates it by walking from one speaker to another. The effect was totally lost as the album was recorded in mono, which the Pythons did not know at the time. They felt disenchanted by the BBC&#x27;s album-producing methods, and for their remaining albums sought very different approaches.

==Audiobook==
The album has been available on CD as an audiobook since 1996. (It was first released as an audiobook in 1994 on cassette.)

In 2011, AudioGO Ltd. released a &quot;Facsimile Edition,&quot; which is the only audiobook version with the original LP&#x27;s artwork. Graham Chapman&#x27;s name is spelled correctly on the cover of this edition.

In 2012, the album was packaged with two discs of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; under the title &quot;BBC Comedy Greats!&quot;.

In June 2014, the album was included as bonus content with the expanded re-release of &#x27;Monty Python Sings (again)&quot; as a deluxe 2-CD set and digital download.

<text>The Hokkaido wolf (Canis lupus hattai), also known as the and in Russia as the Sakhalin wolf, is an extinct subspecies of gray wolf that once inhabited coastal northeast Asia. Its nearest relatives were the wolves of North America rather than Asia. It was exterminated in Hokkaido during the Meiji Restoration period, when American-style agricultural reforms incorporated the use of strychnine-laced baits to kill livestock predators. Some taxonomists believe that it survived up until 1945 on the island of Sakhalin. It was one of two subspecies that were once found in the Japanese archipelago, the other being the Japanese wolf (&quot;C. l. hodophilax&quot;).

==Taxonomy and origin==

The Ezō wolf or Hokkaidō wolf (&quot;Canis lupus hattai&quot; Kishida, 1931) is an extinct subspecies of the gray wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;). In 1890, the skulls of Japanese wolves (&quot;Canis lupus hodophilax&quot;) were compared with those of wolves from Hokkaido in the British Museum. The specimens were noticeably different and explained to be local varieties of the same subspecies. Later, explorers to the Kuril islands of Iturup and Kunashir believed that the wolves they saw there were the Japanese subspecies. In 1889, the wolf became extinct on Hokkaido island. In 1913, Hatta Suburō proposed that the wolf might be related to the Siberian wolf but had no living specimens to undertake further analysis. In 1931, Kishida Kyukishi described a skull from a wolf killed in 1881 and declared it to be a distinct subspecies. In 1935, Pocock examined one of the specimens in the British Museum that had been obtained in 1886 and named it &quot;Canis lupus rex&quot; because of its large size.

Analysis of its mitochondrial DNA showed it to be identical with gray wolf specimens from Canada, Alaska and the US, indicating that the ancestor of the Ezo wolf was genetically related to the ancestor of North American wolves. The coalescence time back to the most recent common ancestor for two Ezo wolf samples was estimated to be 3,100 (between 700 and 5,900) years ago, and the Ezo wolf is estimated to have diverged from North American wolves 9,300 (between 5,700 and 13,700) years ago. These estimates indicate that Ezo wolves colonized Japan more recently than Japanese wolves from the Asian continent during the last glacial period via a land bridge with Sakhalin Island, which existed up to 10,000 years ago. The Tsugaru Strait was 3 km wide during the last glacial period, which prevented Ezo wolves from colonizing Honshu and they likely arrived in Japan less than 14,000 years ago. A more recent study estimates their arrival in Hokkaido less than 10,000 YBP.

Stable isotope analysis measures the amount of different isotopes of the same element contained within a specimen. When conducted on the bone of an extinct specimen, it informs researchers about the diet of the specimen. In 2017, radiocarbon dating and an isotopic analysis of bone collagen was conducted Ezo wolf specimens. The radiocarbon dating confirmed that the wolves spanned different time periods dating back as far as 4,000 years ago. The isotopic analysis showed that feeding habits of these wolves were similar to the modern &quot;coastal&quot; British Columbia wolf, with both populations dependent on both marine and terrestrial prey.

==Range==

Ezo is a Japanese word meaning &quot;foreigner&quot; and referred to the historical lands of the Ainu people to the north of Honshu, which the Japanese named &quot;Ezo-chi&quot;. The Ainu were to be found on Hokkaido, Sakhalin, the Kuril islands, and as far north as the Kamchatka Peninsula.

The range of the Ezo wolf was the Hokkaido and Sakhalin islands, Iturup and Kunashir islands just to the east of Hokkaido in the Kuril archipelago, and the Kamchatka Peninsula. It became extinct on Hokkaido island in 1889. It was reported to be surviving in Sakhalin island and perhaps the Kuril Islands in 1945; however, according to the Soviet zoologist Vladimir Heptner it had not been seen on Sakhalin at the beginning of the 20th century, with vagrant specimens of Siberian forest wolf occasionally crossing into the island via the Nevelskoy Strait, though not permanently settling. Information on the animal&#x27;s presence on the Kuril islands is often contradictory or erroneous. It was tentatively recorded to inhabit Kunashir, Iturup and Paramushir, while wolves reported on Shumshu were later dismissed as feral dogs. A survey undertaken in the mid-1960s could not find a wolf on any of the Kuril islands but did find many feral dogs.

==Description==
A study of Ezo wolf morphology showed that it was similar in size to mainland Asian and North American wolves. It stood 70–80 cm at the withers. Soviet zoologist Vladimir Geptner wrote that the wolves (classed under the nomen dubium &quot;C. l. altaicus&quot;) of Kamchatka (where &quot;C. l. hattai&quot;&#x27;s range is supposed to have encompassed) are just as large as &quot;C. l. lupus&quot;, with light gray fur with dark guard hairs running along the back. Edwin Dun, in his unpublished memoirs, described it in the following terms:

==History==
===In Ainu culture===
The Ainu revered the wolf as the deity Horkew Kamuy (&quot;howling god&quot;), in recognition of the animal&#x27;s similar hunting habits. Wolves were sacrificed in &quot;sending-away&quot; &quot;iomante&quot; ceremonies, and some Ainu communities, such as those in Tokachi and Hidaka, held origin myths linking the birth of the Ainu to a coupling between a white wolf and a goddess. Ainu hunters would leave portions of their kills for wolves, and it was believed that hunters could share a wolf&#x27;s kill if they politely cleared their throats in its presence. Because of the wolf&#x27;s special status in Ainu culture, hunters were forbidden from killing wolves with poison arrows or firearms, and wasting the pelt and meat of a wolf was thought to provoke wolves into killing the hunter responsible. The Ainu did not differentiate wolves from their domestic dogs, and would strive to reproduce wolf traits in their dogs by allowing dogs in heat to roam freely in wolf-inhabited areas in order to produce hybrid offspring.

===Extinction on Hokkaido island===
With the onset of the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Emperor Meiji officially ended Japan&#x27;s long-standing isolationism through the Charter Oath, and sought to modernize Japan&#x27;s agriculture by replacing its dependence on rice farming with American-style ranching. Ohio rancher Edwin Dun was hired as a scientific adviser in 1873 for the Kaitakushi (Hokkaido Development Agency), and began promoting ranching with state-run experimental farms. As wolf predation was inhibiting the propagation of horses in southeastern Hokkaidō and allegedly causing hardship to Ainu deer hunters, the Meiji government declared wolves as &quot;noxious animals&quot; (&quot;yūgai dōbutsu&quot;), entrusting Dun to oversee the animals&#x27; extermination. Dun began his work at the Niikappu ranch with a mass-poisoning campaign involving the use of strychnine-laced baits. This was supplemented by a bounty system established by the Kaitakushi.

<text>KDAL (610 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Duluth, Minnesota, serving the Duluth-Superior area of Northeastern Minnesota and Northwestern Wisconsin. KDAL is owned and operated by Midwest Communications and broadcasts a talk radio format. The radio studios and offices for KDAL, KDAL-FM, KDKE, WDSM, WDUL and KTCO are at 11 East Superior Street, Suite 380, in downtown Duluth.

By day, KDAL transmits with 5,000 watts non-directional. At night, to protect other stations on 610 AM, KDAL uses a directional antenna. Programming is also heard on 250-watt FM translator W280FB at 103.9 MHz.

==Programming==
Weekdays begin with Dave Stranberg and the KDAL Morning Show, featuring news, sports, weather, school closings and local information. Bruce Ciskie hosts a late morning sports show and Bob Sansevere is heard in afternoons. The rest of the weekday schedule comes from nationally syndicated talk shows including &quot;The Ramsey Show&quot; with Dave Ramsey, &quot;Markley, VanCamp and Robbins&quot;, &quot;Our American Stories with Lee Habeeb&quot;, &quot;Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis&quot;, &quot;This Morning, America&#x27;s First News with Gordon Deal&quot; and &quot;Coast to Coast AM with George Noory&quot;.

Weekends feature shows on health, money, religion, technology, travel, cars and home repair, with a polka music show on Saturday mornings. Weekend syndicated shows include &quot;Leo Laporte, The Tech Guy&quot;, &quot;Somewhere in Time with Art Bell&quot; and &quot;World Travel Connection with Rudy Maxa&quot;. KDAL broadcasts Minnesota Twins baseball and University of Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs college football and basketball. Most hours begin with world and national news from CBS Radio News. Local news and weather is supplied by KBJR-TV.

==History==
KDAL signed on the air as a 100-watt station at 1500 kHz on November 22, 1936. The KDAL call sign came from the station&#x27;s founder, Dalton A. LeMasurier, who was president and general manager of KDAL for many years. On September 5, 1937, power increased to 250 watts and the station joined the CBS Radio Network. KDAL broadcast CBS&#x27;s dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;. With the enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), the station moved to 1490 kHz in early 1941.

KDAL switched frequencies to the current 610 kHz on October 24, 1941, increasing power to 1,000 watts. The switchover was dramatically made from a plane flying over the city. In 1947, a new transmitter and tower were constructed at 63rd Avenue West along the harborfront. The facilities remain to this day. KDAL got another power increase again to 5,000 watts on August 7, 1947. A new transmitter and tower were constructed for the boost in wattage. This enabled KDAL to serve a wider area. The event was celebrated with a &quot;Kilowatt Karnival&quot; in the Duluth Armory.

In the 1948-1949 season, CBS raided NBC and grabbed some of their biggest stars. Radio&#x27;s highest rated program, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, moved to CBS and KDAL in January, 1949. &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, &quot;George Burns &amp; Gracie Allen&quot;, &quot;Edgar Bergen &amp; Charlie McCarthy&quot; and Bing Crosby also made the switch. CBS was suddenly the number one network and KDAL finally made some headway against NBC&#x27;s WEBC.

KDAL made the jump to television as KDAL-TV (now KDLH) in 1953. FM station KDAL-FM went on the air in 1985.

Network programming moved from radio to television in the 1950s. KDAL featured a full service, middle of the road (MOR) format of popular music, news and sports in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, the music was updated to adult contemporary. By the late 1990s, the music shows were eliminated and the station became a full time talk outlet.

In the beginning of the 2000s, Midwest acquired KDAL AM/FM, KRBR-FM, WDSM, KTCO and KXTP in the Duluth/Superior market. KDAL would gain an additional sister station in the form of KQDS-FM in 2016, acquired by Midwest from Red Rock Radio.

In 2022, Midwest Communications merged the news-talk programming of sister station WDSM into KDAL. Simultaneously, WDUL&#x27;s sports-talk format was moved to WDSM. AM 710 is now branded as &quot;The Game&quot; with most programming originating from WRNW in Milwaukee. The 98.1 translator from WDSM moved to WDUL, which now airs a contemporary hit radio format as &quot;Hot 98.1&quot;.

<text>Raminder Singh Gill (born 1950 or 1951) is an Indian-born Canadian politician in Ontario. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2003, and has unsuccessfully sought election to the House of Commons of Canada on three occasions. He served as a citizenship judge from 2006 to 2011.

==Background==
Gill was born to a Sikh family in Punjab, India. He was educated at the Parkdale Collegiate Institute and later attended the University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering where he graduated with a Master&#x27;s Degree in Engineering. He works as a chemical engineer in private life, and has invented environmentally friendly products such as &quot;The Alternative Bleach&quot;, offered by the President&#x27;s Choice company. He started a private firm called Genpro Canada Ltd in 1990. Gill has been a director of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Canada, and is a member of the Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario. He was also a founding member of the Malton Cougars Soccer Club.

==Politics==
Gill tried several times to enter politics but was unsuccessful. In 1982, he ran for a seat on Peel District School Board, but lost. In 1993 he sought the federal Liberal nomination for Bramalea—Gore—Malton—Springdale, but lost to Gurbax Malhi. He ran in the 1997 federal election, as a Progressive Conservative in the riding of Mississauga West. He finished third, well behind Liberal Steve Mahoney.

===Provincial politics===
In the 1999 provincial election, Gill ran for the Ontario Progressive Conservatives in the riding of Bramalea--Gore--Malton--Springdale, which has a large Indian-Canadian community. The riding is located in the &quot;905 region&quot;, which at the time was a primary base of support for the Ontario Tories. Gill was elected, defeating Liberal Dave Toor by about 4,000 votes.

During his time in government he served as Parliamentary assistant to several ministers including the Minister of Labour and to the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities.

The Liberal Party made strong gains in the 905 area in the 2003 provincial election, and Gill lost his seat to Liberal candidate Kuldip Kular by almost 4,000 votes, following a bitter and divisive campaign.

===Federal politics===
In the Canadian general election of 2004, Gill ran as a candidate of the Conservative Party in the redistributed riding of Bramalea--Gore--Malton. Although this seat was actively targeted by the Conservatives, Gill lost to incumbent Liberal Gurbax Singh Malhi by 7,800 votes.

In also ran in the 2006 federal election in the riding of Mississauga—Streetsville, against Liberal incumbent Wajid Khan. He lost that contest as well, losing by about 5,800 votes to Khan.

==Citizenship judge==
In the fall of 2006 Gill was appointed as a Federal citizenship judge. Some considered the move as a patronage appointment. Gill was thought to have been &quot;fasttracked&quot; into the post, bypassing the usual screening process. In 2009, he was reappointed to this position, but he was not reappointed in 2012.

<text>The Australian Financial Review (AFR) is an Australian business-focused, compact daily newspaper covering the current business and economic affairs of Australia and the world. The newspaper is based in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; owned by Nine Entertainment and has been published continuously since its founding in 1951. The &quot;AFR&quot; is published in tabloid format six times a week, whilst providing 24/7 online coverage through its website. In November 2019, the &quot;AFR&quot; reached 2.647 million Australians through both print and digital mediums (Mumbrella).

The &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; started as a print-only weekly newspaper in 1951, before changing to a bi-weekly in 1961, and a daily newspaper in 1963. The paper now publishes multiple magazines and a supplementary weekend paper, which was launched in 1995. In that same year, the &quot;AFR&quot; website was also released, which helped to expand its readership base across all media. The &quot;AFR&quot;, along with most of Fairfax Media, was purchased by Nine Entertainment in 2018.

==History==
The &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; newspaper started as a weekly publication in 1951, published by John Fairfax &amp; Sons. The paper&#x27;s main objective was to inform the Australian public on business life and news.

In 1961, the &quot;AFR&quot; converted to a bi-weekly, and then established itself as the first daily newspaper by 1963. Despite other newspapers claiming the title of the first daily national paper, Maxwell Newton was the editor in charge of taking the &quot;Financial Review&quot; from a bi-weekly to the first daily national paper. During 1961–62, the &quot;AFR&#x27;s&quot; primary competitor was The &quot;Australian Financial Times&quot;, which was in operation for less than 12 months. In the 1960s and 1970s, the &quot;AFR&quot; developed a strong readership amongst a specialist business audience due to its neutral stance on domestic government policies. In the 1970s, despite the &quot;AFR&#x27;s&quot; reputation as a national business daily, many saw it as the primary competitor for &quot;The Australian&quot; given its high proportion of readers in the AB demographic.

In 1995, Fairfax launched the &quot;Australian Financial Review Magazine&quot; in response to its growing readership across a wide-ranging audience. The magazine was published to cover topics other than business including leisure, politics, travel, sports, fashion, and other peripheral topics. In December 2019, the magazine recorded an average issue readership of 326,000. Since its launch in 1995, the &quot;AFR Magazine&quot; has won the &#x27;Best Newspaper Inserted Magazine&#x27; (2013-2019), &#x27;Newspaper Inserted Brand of the Year&#x27; (2019) and Mumbrella&#x27;s &#x27;Special Issue of the Year&#x27; (2019).

The magazine&#x27;s founding was followed by the launch of the &quot;AFR&quot; website in the same year, which started as a free online source of financial news.

In 1997, the &quot;AFR&quot; launched its &quot;Weekend Edition&quot; which extended the paper&#x27;s publications into the weekend, with an explicit focus of targeting the growing readership base by providing news articles outside of the traditional finance setting.

In 2016, the &quot;AFR&quot; launched mobile and iPad compatible applications to provide its digital subscribers more accessibility to its news platform. This was aimed at allowing cross-platform accessibility without having to download two separate applications across different device platforms. The application carries similar features to the website including sections such as: Street Talk and Rear Window. The product management team decided to revamp the app due to the wide uptake of smartphones in the Australian market, and to improve their user-interface experience. The UTS Business School was the launch partner for the app, providing logistical advice on the app&#x27;s delivery. The app&#x27;s subscription price is included in the &#x27;all premium digital subscription&#x27; bundle.

The &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; has grown its product offerings since its beginnings as a finance newsroom. It has consistently been well received by the journalism sector as one of the most high-quality newsrooms across Australia. Since the 2000s, the &quot;AFR&quot; has launched &quot;BOSS&quot; (magazine for business leadership and strategy) and the &quot;Sophisticated Traveller&quot; magazine. In 2019, the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; recorded double-digit subscriber growth, as it continued to market its newspaper as the driver of Australian business-people&#x27;s success and ambitions. In 2020, due to the newspaper company&#x27;s expansion efforts across different readership bases, the &quot;AFR&quot; reached 2.647m Australians a month.

=== Evolution of paywall system ===
The &quot;AFR&quot; first introduced its paywall in 2006, charging online users to view its articles – a payment model that had not yet been utilised by any other Australian newspaper firm. The switch to a paywall was done because the newspaper company thought it could further monetise its niche business audience who could afford it. Following this change, the &quot;AFR&quot; continued to adjust the pricing of its subscription due to low subscriber growth.

In 2011, it newly introduced a freemium paywall in which only a small portion of articles were free. It has been noted that the &quot;AFR&#x27;s&quot; website locks approximately 86% of its online content behind a paywall, higher than its closest competitor the &quot;National Business Review&quot;. This was aimed at increasing its digital readership which in 2011 amounted to 6,000 subscribers. In addition, it was later determined that the &quot;AFR&#x27;s&quot; failures in attracting online subscribers was due to its paywall being too expensive. Its 2012 price of $59 AUD was notably higher than other international mastheads, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; which was priced at $37.84 AUD. As a result, the &quot;AFR&quot; has since lowered its digital subscription price to $29.50 AUD.

=== Nine Entertainment merger ===

The mega-cap deal that saw Nine Entertainment and Fairfax Media merge was inspired by initial chats between Hugh Marks (Nine CEO) and Nick Falloon (Fairfax chairman). The pair discussed how the two companies&#x27; assets could synergise, improve efficiencies, save costs and increase scale. During the lead up to the merger, there were a few roadblocks. In 2016, the proposed merger was not feasible due to government legislation surrounding media ownership. In addition, Nine Entertainment&#x27;s board believed that its share price was undervalued and thus wanted to delay any acquisition until its fair value had been reflected. Amongst the delays in talks between the two parties, Fairfax had other suitors including private equity groups TPG Capital and Hellman &amp; Friedman, which ended up walking away from the table.

In 2018, Nine Entertainment&#x27;s board re-entered into talks with Fairfax of a potential merger after its share price had jumped following an upbeat earnings report. The proposed structure of the takeover was 0.3627 Nine shares plus $0.025 AUD per Fairfax share, composing a cash plus scrip deal. This represented a 21.9% takeover premium to Fairfax&#x27;s last close, and valued Fairfax at $2313.8mm AUD. Once the deal was made, it was reported that Fairfax&#x27;s portfolio newspapers, including the &quot;AFR&quot;, would maintain independence from Nine&#x27;s media groups. As part of the proposed deal, Hugh Marks took over corporate control of the combined group with Fairfax CEO, Greg Hywood, stepping down.

The combined entity in 2018 was forecasted to have approximately 6,000 employees (inclusive of all the duplicate roles made redundant), major resources across all media types including print, TV, radio and online; and $3 billion in revenue.

The proposed merger was also put under review by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) on antitrust measures. It was announced in November 2018 that the ACCC would not oppose the merger. The investigation looked at the merger&#x27;s impact on the online news industry&#x27;s competition and involved contacting numerous stakeholders. It was noted that the merger would most likely reduce competition in the domestic media market, but that it was not in breach of the Competition and Consumer Act. The main point of divergence between the two business&#x27; assets was that Nine Entertainment&#x27;s news assets provided mass market news coverage whereas Fairfax Media&#x27;s news assets provided more specialist coverage.

Despite the ACCC&#x27;s ruling, there were a few stakeholders who voiced their concerns about the merger&#x27;s impact on the Australian media industry&#x27;s competitive landscape. Union groups such as the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, and the Journalists&#x27; union warned the ACCC that the mega-cap takeover would threaten the editorial independence of Fairfax Media&#x27;s portfolio newspaper companies. Former prime minister Paul Keating also voiced his criticisms labelling the ACCC&#x27;s decision as &quot;appalling&quot;, considering that a more concentrated media industry would reduce coverage of city-specific political issues.

===Partial phase-out of printed edition===
In October 2022, Nine announced that it would discontinue printing the &quot;Financial Review&quot; in Tasmania, with copies to instead be flown in from Melbourne on the following day. The decision was subsequently reversed.

In May 2024, printed editions of the &quot;Financial Review&quot; were discontinued in Western Australia, which Nine attributed to an increase in printing costs by its competitor Seven West Media, the owners of the only suitable printing press in Western Australia.

Since its beginnings, the compilation of the list and its publishing have been taken over by the &quot;AFR&quot;, now being published annually in the &quot;Australian Financial Review Magazine&quot; and on the afr.com. Along with the names of the richest people, the list explicates the person or family&#x27;s net worth and provides a short summary on the business activities and sector they are engaged in. The valuations are conducted by utilising a mix of publicly available information and private consultations. In 2019, the cut-off for making the Rich List was $472m AUD. In 2020, the cut-off was raised to $540m AUD.

== Reporting ==

=== Reporting stance ===
During 1975 to 1983, when &quot;The Australian&quot; widely articulated its political stance on conservative liberalism, it had been noted that the &quot;AFR&quot; also promoted neo-liberalism through its news coverage and editorials, exerting influence on the business sphere of Australia and its elitist readership base. The newspaper has also been labelled as one of the propagators of radical liberalism during the 1970s–80s, shaping the policy debate surrounding market deregulation at that time. This was in line with the overarching political stance of all Fairfax Holdings owned newspapers, including &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, which in the 1970s was also right-leaning in its political views.

In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, the Australian news media sector was blamed for overlooking corporate corruption and wrongdoings, while publishing mainly favourable news articles handed to them from corporate PR teams. Also during this time, &quot;The National&quot; Times which was Australia&#x27;s leading financial investigative journalism newspaper, shut down after the stock market crash. Therefore, during the 2000s, following the financial market failures and economic downturn of the 1990s, the &quot;AFR&quot; reporting focus steered more towards business investigative journalism, scrutinising big corporations, government power and corruption. This was viewed as the &quot;AFR&quot; making reparations for its lack of scrutiny over the corporate sector in the lead-up to the stock market crash.

One major factor that allowed the &quot;AFR&quot; to undertake deep corporate investigations was that it did not need advertising revenue to stay afloat – its cover price was sufficient. On the other hand, all other daily mastheads needed company advertising to stay profitable. This afforded the &quot;AFR&quot; editors the flexibility to pursue and publish news articles that shed a negative light on major companies without needing to be concerned about its financial impacts.

In the early 2010s, the &quot;AFR&quot; political stance has been labelled as neutral. During the controversial 2013 tax debate regarding taxes for &quot;extraordinary&quot; profits generated by mining companies, major mastheads from regions with high mining interests had almost fourfold the number of negative articles compared to positive articles. &quot;The Australian&quot;, the biggest national daily, had a large number of both positive and negative articles, but had a limited number of neutral articles. Out of all the daily mastheads, the &quot;AFR&quot; published the most articles surrounding the tax debate and also the most number of neutral articles.

===Endorsements===
=== Notable reporting ===
In November 2023, the AFR joined with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and 69 media partners including Distributed Denial of Secrets and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and more than 270 journalists in 55 countries and territories to produce the &#x27;Cyprus Confidential&#x27; report on the financial network which supports the regime of Vladimir Putin, mostly with connections to Cyprus, and showed Cyprus to have strong links with high-up figures in the Kremlin, some of whom have been sanctioned. Government officials including Cyprus president Nikos Christodoulides and European lawmakers began responding to the investigation&#x27;s findings in less than 24 hours, calling for reforms and launching probes.

==Awards==
&quot;AFR&quot; has won the &quot;Gold Lizzy&quot; for Best Title at &quot;The Lizzies&quot;, aka the IT Journalism Awards, many times, including in 2019, 2021, and 2022. It has also won in other categories, including Best Business Coverage.

<text>Rennard Cordon Davis (May 23, 1940 – February 2, 2021) was an American anti-war activist who gained prominence in the 1960s. He was one of the Chicago Seven defendants charged for anti-war demonstrations and large-scale protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He had a prominent organizational role in the American anti–Vietnam War protest movement of the 1960s.

In the early 1970s, Davis became a follower of Guru Maharaj Ji (Prem Rawat) and his Divine Light Mission. He began to travel as a spiritual lecturer. He also became a venture capitalist, and founded the Foundation for a New Humanity to combine these goals.

==Early life==
Davis was born in Lansing, Michigan, on May 23, 1940. His family moved to Berryville, Virginia, when he was in the seventh grade. His father, John, worked in nearby Washington, D.C., including as chief of staff to the Council of Economic Advisers under President Harry S. Truman. His mother, Dorothy, was employed as a schoolteacher. Davis studied at Oberlin College starting in 1958. After graduating, he went on to obtain a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Illinois.

In the 1960s, Davis became active in the Students for a Democratic Society. He was the National Director of their project of community organizing programs (the Economic Research and Action Project, or ERAP) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He became increasingly allied with anti-war groups, and helped organize protests and related events before and during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago for the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (&quot;the Mobe&quot;).

==Democratic Convention protests and subsequent trial==
Davis was one of the principal organizers of the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam to plan anti-war protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. He negotiated unsuccessfully to gain a permit with Chicago city counsel David Stahl.
 At a police riot in Grant Park on August 27, 1968, Davis was among protesters beaten by Chicago police officers, and he suffered a concussion.

The Chicago Eight (later known as the Chicago Seven) were eight men charged with conspiracy, inciting to riot, and other charges related to the nonviolent and violent protests that took place in Chicago. The original eight protester/defendants, as indicted by the grand jury on March 20, 1969, included Davis, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, John Froines, Lee Weiner, and Bobby Seale, a Black Panther leader.

During the early part of the trial, Seale&#x27;s case was separated from the others. The Chicago Seven defense attorneys were William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass of the Center for Constitutional Rights. The judge was Julius Hoffman. The prosecutors were Richard Schultz and Tom Foran. The trial began on September 24, 1969. On October 9, the Illinois National Guard was called in to join the Chicago police for crowd control, as demonstrations grew outside the courtroom. Davis was found guilty of inciting to riot and sentenced to five years imprisonment. His conviction was overturned on appeal.

At his testimony, given January 23, 1970, Davis related, for the Court, a speech he gave at the University of Chicago on November 20, 1967, and, by extension, his reasons for demonstrating at the Democratic National Convention. The suppression of his testimony led the defense to motion for a mistrial. During his speech, Davis held up a small green steel ball, about the size of a tennis ball, and described how 640 of them were dropped by an American F-105 fighter jet over Nam Ding, Vietnam.
Foran objected that the methods and techniques used during the Vietnam war had nothing to do with whether or not people in the United States had a right to travel in interstate commerce to incite a riot. The Court sustained the objection and Kunstler motioned for a mistrial.

==Divine Light Mission==
In the early 1970s, Davis became a follower of Guru Maharaj Ji (Prem Rawat). He was a spokesperson and speaker at the widely publicized Millennium &#x27;73 event organized by Divine Light Mission in the Houston Astrodome. He described the arrival of Guru Maharaj Ji as, &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; quoted Davis as stating: &quot;This city is going to be remembered through all the ages of human civilization.&quot; An op-ed in the &quot;San Francisco Sunday Examiner&quot; speculated at the time as to whether Davis had undergone a lobotomy, and suggested, &quot;If not, maybe he should try one.&quot;

==Foundation for a New Humanity==
Davis later became a venture capitalist and lecturer on meditation and self-awareness. He created the Foundation for a New Humanity, a technology development and venture capital company commercializing breakthrough technologies.

He appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Barbara Walters, CNN, Phil Donahue, VH1, and other network television programs. He consulted and provided advice in business strategies for Fortune 500 companies.

Davis returned to Chicago for the 1996 Democratic National Convention to speak at the &quot;Festival of Life&quot; in Grant Park. He also appeared on a panel with activist Tom Hayden discussing &quot;a progressive counterbalance to the religious right&quot;.

In a 2005 article published in the &quot;Iowa Source&quot;, Davis said:
== Death ==
Davis died on February 2, 2021, at his home in Berthoud, Colorado. He was 80 and suffered from lymphoma, which was discovered only two weeks prior to his death.

<doc id="1251188" wikidata="Q5125760" url="?curid=1251188" title="Clandestine (band)">
<text>Clandestine is a Celtic music group from Houston, Texas. Featuring bagpipes, guitar, fiddle, and drums (bodhrán and conga drums), they play traditional Celtic music (both instrumental and vocal) as well as some modern tunes (including some originals) in a Celtic style. Some songs include additional instruments like the flute, bombarde and various whistles. They formed in 1991, stabilized as a quartet in 1996, and dissolved for a time in 2003. In their original incarnation, the band made 4 discs and toured heavily around the US and also performed in Europe. They were favorites at McGonigel&#x27;s Mucky Duck Pub in their hometown of Houston, as well as the Cactus Cafe in nearby Austin.

The band reformed with a change in membership in late 2006.

== History ==
The original Clandestine was a pipe-and-drum quartet in Houston. Original member bagpiper E.J. Jones moved to Pittsburgh, met guitarist and singer Jen Hamel in Pittsburgh, and convinced her to return to Houston to perform as part of Clandestine. In 1995, fiddle player Gregory McQueen joined. The first disc (&quot;The Ale is Dear&quot;) featured this trio. In 1996 percussionist and singer Emily Dugas joined, and the remaining 3 discs include all 4 members. Jen Hamel and Emily Dugas both sang. In February 2003 the band performed their last show in that original incarnation.

In 2005, E.J., Emily and Gregory began playing with various other artists as the Emily Dugas Band. In 2006, with Jen&#x27;s blessing, they officially reformed Clandestine with themselves and a fourth member, Al Cofrin, on Irish cittern, folk guitar, and medieval bagpipes. The band made their formal debut as Clandestine at the Mucky Duck Pub in Houston on St. Andrew&#x27;s Day, November 30, 2006.

<text>Robert Kevin Appier (; born December 6, 1967) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily for the Kansas City Royals.

Appier&#x27;s solid pitching during his first full season in the majors earned him several rookie accolades in . His fastball, tight slider and nasty forkball contributed to impressive pitching statistics, distinguishing himself as one of the American League&#x27;s top right-handed starting pitchers throughout much of the 1990s. Appier enjoyed the most success with the Royals in the early to mid-1990s as one of the league&#x27;s earned run average leaders, a Cy Young Award contender in and culminating in with a selection to the American League All-Star team. He was a starting pitcher on the World Series champion Anaheim Angels in , before retiring four seasons later.

==Career==
===Kansas City Royals===
Appier had a strong rookie campaign for the Kansas City Royals in 1990, going 12-8 and posting the league&#x27;s fourth-best ERA (2.76), thus earning him Rookie Pitcher of the Year honors. In , he had 13 wins (tied for the team best), and pitched 3 shutouts, two of which were back to back against the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. He was the Opening Day starter in and posted a 15–8 record with the league&#x27;s second-best ERA (2.46) for a team that only went 72–90. Highlights of the season included a career-high nine-game winning streak and the American League Pitcher of the Month award for July, in which he went 4–0 with a 1.55 ERA. In , Appier posted an 18–8 record with an AL leading 2.56 ERA, set a club record of 33 consecutive scoreless innings, and finished third in Cy Young Award balloting. In , he was selected for his only All-Star team, pitching 2 perfect innings for the American League. He reached a career high in strikeouts in with 207, and won his first of two Roberto Clemente Awards (the other in ). Appier suffered through his first sub-.500 season in 1997, despite posting a 3.40 ERA (7th best in AL)

Despite being one of the better pitchers in baseball during this time period, his accomplishments went largely unnoticed due to playing for the Royals, a small market team that was generally not in contention during Appier&#x27;s tenure. In , under the promise of the team&#x27;s improvement, he signed a long-term extension. During that offseason, he suffered a fall at his home resulting in a separated clavicle. Though he recovered from that injury, in March 1998 he needed surgery for an unrelated long-term progressing shoulder ailment, the repair of a torn labrum, causing him to miss nearly the entire 1998 season. In , after losing faith in the direction of the Royals organization and eager to play with a contender, Appier requested to be traded.

===Oakland Athletics===
In the middle of the 1999 season, Appier was dealt to the Oakland Athletics for three pitchers, Jeff D&#x27;Amico, Brad Rigby and Blake Stein. As the Athletics made their surprising run winning the AL West title in , Appier provided a solid veteran arm in support of Oakland&#x27;s developing young starters, making his eight Opening Day start and winning 15 games for the fifth time in his career. Despite a good showing, he lost his only start in that year&#x27;s ALDS when the Athletics were shut out. In Game 5, after the Yankees scored 6 runs in the first inning, Appier (for the first time in 10 years) came in to relieve in the 2nd inning, pitching four innings and allowing one run. For the series, Appier posted a 3.48 ERA with 13 strikeouts in 10.1 innings pitched.

===New York Mets===
A free agent after the season, Appier signed a four-year, $42 million contract with the New York Mets, with which he tied for the team lead in wins, going 11–10 with a 3.57 ERA and went undefeated in his final 12 appearances, going 6-0 during that span. Making a playoff push, the Mets went 6–0 in his final six starts with Appier going 4–0 with a 1.87 ERA.

===Anaheim Angels===
After the one season campaign in New York, Appier was traded to the Anaheim Angels for Mo Vaughn. During a solid season with the World Series winning Angels in , Appier went 14–12 with a 3.92 ERA. In Game 2 of the ALDS, Appier went 5 innings, giving up 3 runs, and left the game leading 4–3, but received a no-decision in an Angels victory after a blown save by Francisco Rodríguez. In Game One of the ALCS, Appier went 5 innings in a 2–1 loss against the Minnesota Twins. He also started Game 5, going innings and leaving with the Angels leading 3–2 in the game that sent Anaheim to the World Series, though he once again did not receive the decision. He finished the ALCS with a 3.48 ERA. Starting Game 2 of the World Series, Appier did not factor into the decision after allowing 5 runs in two innings, as the Angels went on to win the game 11–10. With the Angels facing elimination, Appier started Game 6, pitching four innings of shutout ball before yielding a two-run home run in the fifth inning, and leaving with a man on base who eventually scored via stolen base and wild pitch off Francisco Rodriguez, leaving him with an 11.37 ERA for the Series, which the Angels won in seven games.

===Return to Kansas City===
In , Appier was plagued with a previously undiagnosed flexor tendon injury and was eventually released at the end of July. He signed with the Royals, but after four starts needed surgery. After missing most of , Appier briefly retired, but came out of retirement and re-signed with the Royals to a minor-league contract before the season, failing to make the team in Spring training and retiring on March 29.

In 2011, Appier was inducted into the Kansas City Royals Hall of Fame. During his 13 seasons with Kansas City, he accumulated an overall record of 115–92 with an ERA of 3.49 over the course of 287 games.

===Seattle Mariners===
In October , Appier applied for reinstatement with Major League Baseball and signed a minor-league contract with the Seattle Mariners. During 10 games with the AAA Tacoma Rainiers, Appier was 1–2 with a 4.54 ERA. On June 3, , Appier asked for and was granted his release by the Mariners, officially retiring the next month.

<text>Saturn is a summer resort on the Romanian seacoast, on the Black Sea, north of Mangalia.

== Features and Climate ==

Completed in 1972, the resort has two major beaches: Adras beach, located in the northern part of the resort, closer to Venus, and Diana beach in the south, located near the town of Mangalia. The climate in the area of Comorova is warmer compared to other seaside resorts such as Mamaia, Eforie or Costinești. This is because the Comorova resorts are located in the southernmost area, but also because of the reduce of Comorova forest which cooled the area. In winter, aside from several guards and maintenance staff, the resort is deserted.

<doc id="1251215" wikidata="Q2269108" url="?curid=1251215" title="Pullip">
<text>Pullip () is a fashion doll created by Cheonsang Cheonha of South Korea in 2003. Pullip has a jointed plastic body (1:6 scale) and a relatively oversized head (1:3 scale), with eyes that can move from side to side and eyelids that can blink. Pullip was first marketed by Jun Planning out of Japan; but the company underwent management changes in early 2009 and, since then, has operated out of South Korea under the name Groove. Since the release of the original female doll, other companion dolls have been added: male dolls Namu (나무, tree) (Namu is not on the market anymore) and Taeyang (태양, sun); Taeyang&#x27;s younger sister, Dal (달, moon); Dal&#x27;s best friend, Byul (별, star); and Pullip&#x27;s younger brother, Isul (이슬, dew). In February 2013, a new member of the Pullip family was introduced, called Yeolume (열매, berry/fruit), who is Pullip&#x27;s future daughter. There is also a miniature line called Little Pullip, with 1:12 scale bodies and 1:6 scale heads. Pullip and her counterpart dolls are often customized by collectors, with the most common customizations including wig changes, eye color changes and rebodying.

==Design==
Pullip dolls have a unique eye movement mechanism that allows their eyes to move from side to side and their eyelids to blink, all via levers on the back of the head. Pullips released after January 2008 can not only blink but also keep their eyes closed via these levers. Pullip has an articulated body and can be easily customized. Standing at 12 inches tall, Pullip&#x27;s body is about 9 inches tall and is on the 1:6 scale, while her oversized head is about 3 inches tall and on the 1:3 scale. With a 1:6 scale body, Pullip is approximately the size of many popular playscale fashion dolls, such as Barbie and Jenny. Pullip can sometimes wear playscale doll clothing and shoes. However, the 1:3 scale of her relatively oversized head is approximately the same size as many larger or SD-sized ball-jointed doll heads.

===Body types===
Pullip&#x27;s highly articulated stock body has gone through several changes over the years. Early Pullips—the first 10 releases from July to December 2003—had what is called the Type 1 body, which was a Marmit-style action figure body with visible screws. The first three Pullip releases (Wind/Debut, Street, and Moon) have necks that can snap easily under the weight of the oversized Pullip head, but this fragile neck problem was corrected with later releases. Another common problem with the Type 1 body is vertical splitting between the two halves of the legs. All Pullips released on the Type 1 body have rooted hair.

Starting in January 2004 with the release of Pullip Venus, a new stock body was introduced. The Type 2 body had a soft torso, no visible screws, and joints that could be pulled apart. This body had more realistic proportions and, to date, is the most posable, flexible, and articulated Pullip stock body ever released. The primary disadvantage of this body is that the soft plastic torso causes chemical melt on the hard plastic limbs and pieces that remain in contact with it, including the hip joint/lower torso piece and the ball joints of the shoulders. If measures are not actively taken to prevent it, the soft torso can also cause a ring of chemical melt around the neck hole in Pullip&#x27;s head. Although chemical melt is the most widely recognized problem with the Type 2 body, it is not known whether environmental conditions (heat, humidity) exacerbate the melt. Other common problems with the Type 2 body are that limbs can fall off or pull apart too easily and that the soft torso can pop out of the hip joint. Only the first three Pullips released on a Type 2 body (Venus, Savon, and Nomado) have rooted hair; all subsequent releases, starting with Arietta in March 2004, have glued-on wigs, which can be removed and changed if desired.

With the dual release of Lan Ake and Lan Ai in August 2005, the next stock body, the Type 3, was introduced. Relative to the Type 2 body, the Type 3 had less articulation; a smaller, more juvenile sculpt; and hinged wrist and ankle joints. While sturdier than its predecessors, the Type 3 was the least posable stock body and remains so even today. Many Pullip collectors expressed displeasure with the Type 3 body, especially after having grown accustomed to the superior aesthetics and possibility of the Type 2. The most common problem with the Type 3 body is wrist cracking, which was prevalent with the Pullips released after January 2007, starting with Stica. Additionally, the leg and knee joints on the Type 3 body often make a creaking noise when bent.

In January 2009 with the release of Neo Noir, another Pullip stock body was introduced: the Type 4, which is still in production today. This body is more posable than the Type 3 and uses peg-and-hole joints to prevent the wrist cracking that occurred with the Type 3 body. Common problems with the Type 4 body are stiff, creaky joints; knees that can bend backwards; and loose-fitting pegs at the wrist and knee, causing limbs to easily slip apart. The vertical leg split that occurred with Type 1 bodies can also sometimes occur at the knees of the Type 4 body.

==Releases==
New editions of Pullip dolls are released on a monthly basis. Additional limited-release exclusives are sold occasionally. Each doll has a unique name with distinct face makeup (called a &quot;faceup&quot;), hair, outfit, accessories, collector&#x27;s card, doll stand and box. (Some of the earliest Pullips did not come with a collector&#x27;s card or a doll stand.)

Between 2003 and 2014, there have been over 220 Pullip doll releases. The regular monthly releases of Pullip are limited in that only a certain amount are produced; this number is known only by the manufacturer.

Occasionally, a limited-edition, exclusive Pullip will be made in a quantity between 300 and 2000 and will be sold in addition to the regular monthly release. In early 2006, with the release of limited-edition Fall Purezza, Jun Planning announced that it would no longer produce exclusive Pullips because their sales cannibalized the demand for the regular monthly releases. However, the company apparently changed their mind in early 2007 with the release of the first US store exclusive, Haute LA, by HauteDoll, which was later followed by multiple Japan exclusives. Some stores that have had these exclusive Pullips are Toys-R-Us Japan, who sold Vivien in November 2004; Magma Heritage, in Singapore, who sold Bianca, Oren and Mitzi in 2004; HauteDoll, in Los Angeles and New York, who sold Haute LA and Haute NY in 2007; TBS shop, in Japan, who sold Kirakishou in September 2007 as well as a limited version of Sparrow and (new) Shinku in March 2014; and pullip.net, in South Korea. Until September 2007, the limited-release exclusive dolls came with a certificate showing their production number; however, as of 2014, certificates are included only sporadically with the exclusives/limited-edition dolls.

Prior to 2006, Jun Planning released some editions that bore close resemblance to popular characters and celebrities but are not officially licensed. Fantastic Alice is similar to Disney&#x27;s rendition of Alice in Wonderland. Rida bears resemblance to Nana. The &quot;Happy Birthday #2&quot; set includes a Native American Pullip named Sacagawea and Namu named Geronimo.

In anticipation of the 5th anniversary of Pullip in 2008, five dolls were released as part of the &quot;Another Alice&quot; limited-edition series, including Another Alice, Another Queen, Another King (Taeyang), Another Rabbit (Dal), and Another Clock Rabbit (Dal). Only 500 of each of these dolls were produced. This series was inspired by Alice in Wonderland. Their original release date was postponed in order to include the updated eye-closing feature on Taeyang Another King, and the series ended up being released in August 2007. Collectors who ordered the complete set received a bonus flamingo figurine.

===Collaborations and licensed releases===
In 2006, Jun Planning began releasing licensed Pullips based on the characters from the anime/manga Rozen Maiden series. With the exception of the final Rozen Maiden Pullip, Kirakishou (which was an exclusive to TBS/Japan), the Rozen Maiden dolls were not limited editions.

Since 2007, several Pullip dolls have been released through fashion and design-based collaborations, such as with designer H. Naoto; clothing brand SunaUna; Lolita fashion houses Angelic Pretty and Baby, The Stars Shine Bright; and doll customizers Kanihoru, Mitsubachi@BabyBee, Silver Butterfly, Sheryl Designs and PoisonGirl.

Several other Pullip dolls have been released through commercial collaborations to portray well-known fictional characters, including Hello Kitty and My Melody from Sanrio; Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu from Neon Genesis Evangelion; Grell, Sebastian and Ciel from Black Butler; Angelique Limoges, Rayne, and Erenfried from Neo Angelique Abyss; Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Tinkerbell and Tiger Lily from Disney&#x27;s Peter Pan film; and Dumbo and Pinocchio from their eponymous Disney films. Three Pullips have been based on characters in Audrey Hepburn films, including Holly, from Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s; Princess Ann, from the film Roman Holiday; and Sabrina, from the film Sabrina. Several Pullips released from 2011–2014 were based on Vocaloid characters.

The majority of these collaborations have not been exclusive or limited-edition dolls, but they do have higher MSRPs than conventional releases because of licensing costs.

==Pullip&#x27;s companions==

===Namu===
Namu was the first male counterpart to Pullip and his character was introduced as her boyfriend. Namu was 34 cm tall and had an oversized head (1:3 scale, like Pullip) and an articulated body. Also like Pullip, Namu&#x27;s eyes can be moved from side to side and his eyelids can blink via levers on the back of the head. He can be customized similar to Pullip dolls. Clothing for Namu can be exchanged with many 1:6 action figures and dolls, including the modern Ken doll.

There were seven versions of Namu released between 2004 and 2005. The first Namu, called Vispo, had rooted hair, similar to the early Pullips; however, all subsequent Namu releases had glued-on wigs. Jun Planning retired Namu in 2005 under the story that he and Pullip had &quot;broken up.&quot; The final Namu, released in May 2005, was &quot;Happy Birthday Namu #2,&quot; also called Geronimo and came in a set together with Pullip Sacagawea. In 2006, a new male doll called Taeyang replaced Namu.

===Taeyang===
Taeyang was introduced in February 2006 as Pullip&#x27;s new boyfriend, replacing Namu. The first Taeyang released was named MJ and was intended as a counterpart to Pullip Rida. Taeyang&#x27;s body is the same as his predecessor, Namu, but his face and head sculpt are different, with a wider jaw and blunter chin. Like Pullip, Taeyang has eyes that move from side to side, and eyelids that can blink and close, via levers on the back of his head. Starting with Taeyang Hash in August 2007, Taeyang&#x27;s eyelids could remain closed via these levers. Taeyang can be customized, just like Pullip can, with the ability to change his hair, eyes, faceup, and body. He stands 36 cm tall and can exchange clothes with many 1:6 action figures and dolls, including the modern Ken doll. Taeyang is released on a bi-monthly basis by Jun Planning.

Since 2006, Jun Planning has released six to seven versions of Taeyang each year, with more than 50 different releases in total. Some of the Taeyang dolls bear close resemblance to popular characters and celebrities. Taeyang Edward Scissorhands is licensed from Tim Burton&#x27;s eponymous character. Taeyang Shade bears close resemblance to Sherlock Holmes. Taeyang Another King was inspired by the King of Hearts from the Alice in Wonderland story.

===Dal===
Dal was introduced in October 2006, with the first three versions–Drta, Fiori and Monomono–released concurrently. Dal is profiled as Taeyang&#x27;s 13-year-old sister, who considers Pullip to be her rival in terms of fashion and style. Just as Pullip is approximately the size of 1:6 scale fashion dolls like Barbie and Jenny, Dal is similar in size to &quot;little sister&quot;-type dolls such as Skipper and Licca. Dal is 26.3 cm in height and, when standing next to Pullip, comes up to her shoulder.

Dal&#x27;s body articulation is similar to Pullip&#x27;s. Her eyes move from side to side, but they do not close. Dals can be customized, just like Pullips and Taeyangs. Jun Planning announced in the beginning of 2008 that a new Dal would be released every month. Since then, the manufacturer has occasionally skipped a few months between releases; however, to date, there have been more than 75 Dals released in total.

===Byul===
Byul was introduced in December 2008, with the first version named Eris. Byul shares the Dal body type but has a different face sculpt. She is profiled as Dal&#x27;s 13-year-old best friend who has secretly lost her heart to Isul, Pullip&#x27;s little brother. Just like Dals, Byuls cannot close their eyes, and their height is 26.3 cm. A new Byul is released approximately every two to five months. Since 2008, there have been more than 25 Byul releases.

===Isul===
Isul is Pullip&#x27;s 15-year-old brother and was first released in February 2011. The debut Isul was named Apollo and was part of the Steampunk series of Pullip dolls. Like Pullip, Isul has eyes that can move from side to side and eyelids that can blink and close via levers on the back of the head. Isul is profiled as a high school student in San Francisco who likes to play soccer. As a prodigy, he is a fan of reading university literature. In personality, he is said to be very calm, tender and helpful. Isul is 29.5 cm tall. Isul is released approximately once per month, but the Groove sometimes skips a month or two between releases. Since 2011, there have been more than 30 Isul releases.

===Yeolume===
Released in February 2013, Yeolume is Pullip&#x27;s future daughter and the newest addition to the Pullip line of dolls. Yeolume is 26 cm tall, and the first release, named Podo, wears a school uniform with a pink and blue bow. According to her biography on the official Pullip website, Yeolume is 10 years old and is an elementary school student.

Yeolume is approximately the same size as Dal and, like Dal and Byul, her eyes moves from side to side but cannot close. However, unlike Dal and Byul, the design of Yeloume&#x27;s body is very different: she has minimal articulation points, and her body somewhat resembles a Little Pullip (though larger in size) or a Blythe doll. However, Yeolume&#x27;s arms and legs do bend and she can be posed to a certain extent. Like the other dolls in the Pullip line, Yeolume is customizable and her body can easily be swapped for a sturdier, more flexible body (e.g., a Pure Neemo or Obitsu body).

===Little Pullip===
Little Pullip is a miniature version of Pullip, with a 1:12 scale body and a 1:6 scale head. Often called a &quot;mini,&quot; these little versions stand about 4.5 inches tall. Little Pullips lack articulated elbows or knee joints, their shoes are painted on, and their eyes do not move or blink. Despite their small size and limited articulation points, they are still somewhat customizable: they can be given new wigs, bodies, eye colors, and makeup.

Several editions of Little Pullip are miniature replica of full-sized Pullip dolls with similar name, clothes, hair, and makeup, such as Principessa, Cornice, and Mir. The Little Pullips who happen to not be modeled after a full-sized doll are unique to the Little Pullip line, such as Riletto, Aloalo, and Miss Green. The only Pullip doll that was first released as a Little Pullip and later released as a larger, full-sized doll was Pullip Froggy. There have been themed releases for the Little Pullip line that are distinct and completely separate from the full-sized releases, including the Western astrological signs and the Bremen Town Musicians.

Little Pullips were first introduced in January 2005 with the release of Moon, a miniature replica of the full-sized Pullip doll of the same name. Production of Little Pullips stopped in March 2007 but resumed in October 2009 under the name Little Pullip +. The primary difference between the original line and the Plus line is that the latter dolls have a ball-jointed head that can swivel and tilt to different angles, allowing for more expressiveness than the original Little Pullip head, which could only turn from side to side along a single axis.

There are also Little Taeyangs, Little Dals and Little Byuls that are part of the Little Pullip line. The Docolla line (a portmanteau of &quot;doll&quot; + &quot;collaboration&quot;) was released as an extension of the Little Pullip + line, beginning in July 2011 with the release of miniature Pullip Grell from Black Butler.

==Related Merchandise==

===Pullip Costume===
Pullip Costume/Fashion are clothes and accessories sold by Jun Planning for Pullip dolls. This includes complete costumes, articles of clothing, and accessories. Pullip Costume items are released sporadically.

===Petit Luxury===
Petit Luxury are display furniture for Pullip released by Jun Planning of Japan, starting in January 2008. This includes classic French armchairs and other pieces in resin.

===Magazine===
In July 2005, Jun Planning authorized &quot;Pullip Magazine,&quot; a book that is 88 pages long and written in Japanese. The magazine book includes the full catalog of each Pullip released up to that point, concepts, interviews with the designers, collaborations with popular clothing lines, guides on customizing Pullips, and outfit patterns of brand-name fashion designs.

In August 2010 a second book, entitled &quot;Pullip Complete Style&quot; and again printed in Japanese, became available to purchase on its own and as part of a special box set with limited-edition Pullip Bonita. This book is 133 pages and features photographs of all the Pullip releases from 2003 to autumn 2010.

==Customizing==
Like the more expensive ball-jointed dolls, Pullips are easily customizable. Pullips released prior to March 2004 had rooted hair, but their scalp pieces can be swapped with each other. Beginning in March 2004, all dolls in the Pullip line–starting with Pullip Arietta and Namu Trunk–were released with removable wigs, thus allowing their hair to be changed more easily.

Pullip and her companions can be given new bodies in a process called rebodying. Popular rebodying options include 1:6 scale bodies made by companies such as Obitsu, Volks, and Pure Neemo. Some collectors prefer to rebody with 1:6 scale action figure bodies or with playline doll bodies, such from Barbie or Liv dolls.

All dolls in the Pullip line have heads and eye mechanisms that can be taken apart with a screwdriver. Customization changes range from minor, such as new wigs or eye colors, to major, including new faceups and fully custom dolls with completely new designs. More intensive customization can include resculpting the face or body, piercings and body jewelry (which can be done either with glue on the surface of the doll or with a small drill to make a permanent hole), and painted or carved tattoos.

==Controversy==
The Pullip release originally scheduled for July 2005 was called Beressa, a &quot;lady spy,&quot; who came with a black uniform and cap with gold braids and red details, including a red arm band and a pistol. Although no swastikas were visible on the doll or in photographs, the resemblance of the uniform and gun design bore a close resemblance to German SS officer uniforms. Jun Planning announced the cancellation of Beressa out of respect for the 60th anniversary of the Holocaust. Lan Ake, the Pullip that was created to replace Beressa, was delayed by a month; consequently, Jun Planning ended up not releasing a Pullip during July 2005 and instead released Lan Ake and Lan Ai together in August 2005.

<text>In object-oriented programming, a member variable (sometimes called a member [[Field (computer science)|field]]) is a variable that is associated with a specific object, and accessible for all its methods (&quot;member functions&quot;).

In class-based programming languages, these are distinguished into two types: &quot;class variables&quot; (also called &quot;static member variables&quot;), where only one copy of the variable is shared with all instances of the class; and &quot;instance variables&quot;, where each instance of the class has its own independent copy of the variable.

== Examples ==
=== C++ ===
class Foo {
 int bar; // Member variable
 public:
 void setBar(const int newBar) { 
 bar = newBar;
};

int main () {
 Foo rect; // Local variable

 return 0;

=== Java ===

public class Program
 public static void main(String[] args)
 // This is a local variable. Its lifespan
 // is determined by lexical scope.
 Foo foo;
}

public class Foo
 /* This is a member variable - a new instance
 of this variable will be created for each 
 new instance of Foo. The lifespan of this
 variable is equal to the lifespan of &quot;this&quot;
 instance of Foo

 int bar;


=== Python ===

class Foo:
 def __init__(self):
 self._bar = 0

 @property
 def bar(self):
 return self._bar

 @bar.setter
 def bar(self, new_bar):
 self._bar = new_bar

f = Foo()
f.bar = 100
print(f.bar)
=== Common Lisp ===

(defclass foo () (bar)) 
(defvar f (make-instance &#x27;foo)) 
(setf (slot-value f &#x27;bar) 100)
(print (slot-value f &#x27;bar))
=== Ruby ===
 Ruby has three member variable types: class, class instance, and instance.

class Dog

 # The class variable is defined within the class body with two at-signs
 # and describes data about all Dogs *and* their derived Dog breeds (if any)
 @@sniffs = true

end

mutt = Dog.new
mutt.class.sniffs #=&gt; true

class Poodle &lt; Dog

 # The &quot;class instance variable&quot; is defined within the class body with a single at-sign
 # and describes data about only the Poodle class. It makes no claim about its parent class
 # or any possible subclass derived from Poodle
 @sheds = false

 # When a new Poodle instance is created, by default it is untrained. The &#x27;trained&#x27; variable
 # is local to the initialize method and is used to set the instance variable @trained
 # An instance variable is defined within an instance method and is a member of the Poodle instance
 def initialize(trained = false)
 @trained = trained
 end

 def has_manners?
 @trained
 end

end

p = Poodle.new
p.class.sheds #=&gt; false
p.has_manners? #=&gt; false
=== PHP ===

&lt;?php

$example = new Example(5);

<text>Stanisław Rewera Potocki (, 1589–1667) was a Polish noble, magnate and military leader. Together with Stefan Czarniecki he was successful in defending the Commonwealth against the invading Swedes and Russians during The Deluge. He was the most trusted advisor of King John II Casimir.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Initially a lukewarm member of the Polish Reformed Church, under the influence of Jesuits and his first wife he converted from Calvinism to Catholicism. Potocki was married to Zofia Kalinowska and Anna Mohyła. After careful studies at home and abroad (mostly in France and in the Netherlands) he began his great military career by fighting the rebels with his father and uncles on the side of King Sigismund III at the Battle of Guzów. He then took part in an expedition to Wallachia and in the siege of Smolensk in 1611, during the Polish-Russian war. He also fought at Cecora (1620) and Chocim (1621). He took part in the war with Sweden (1626–1629) temporarily replacing Stanisław Koniecpolski, and suffered a major defeat at Górzno in 1629. He fought the rebellious Cossacks in the years 1637–1638.

===Military career===

He was the &quot;podkomorzy&quot; (Chamberlain) of Podolia from 1621, castellan of Kamieniec Podolski from 1628, and voivod of the Bratslav Voivodeship from 1631 and the Podolia voivodeship from 1636. Potocki became Field Crown Hetman in 1652 and Great Crown Hetman in 1654. He was voivod of Kiev Voivodship from 1655 and voivod of Kraków Voivodship from 1658. Potocki was also Starost of Halych, Radom, Krasnystaw, Ropczyce, Medyka, Bar, Grodziec, Kolomyia, Mostyska, Drahimów, Letychiv and Dolina.

He was the Elector of King Władysław IV representing the Bratslav province in 1632. He was also the Elector of King John II Casimir in 1648 from the province of Podolia. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising, it is believed that Potocki saved the king&#x27;s life near the town of Zborów. In 1652 he was appointed the Field Hetman of the Commonwealth and two years later he commanded the Polish army against the Russians and Cossacks. In 1655 he fought and won the Battle of Ochmatów. In the same year he was nominated the voivode of Kiev. After the invasion of the Swedish army during the Deluge he was permanently commanding the army in the East, however not engaging against the Swedes. After the defeat of the Russian-Cossack army under Gródek Jagielloński Potocki was forced to surrender to King Charles X Gustav. He later joined the confederation at Tyszowce. In the 1656–1660 campaigns Potocki was not the supreme commander of the entire forces of the Crown, however he did have control over his division which took part in the battles. He was one of the Hetmans that participated in the Battle of Warsaw in 1656. In 1657 he fought victoriously with George II Rákóczi, and took part in the pinning of his troops near Czarny Ostrów. In 1660, acting jointly with Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, Potocki was victorious over the Russian army led by Vasyl Sheriemietiev, forcing him to surrender at Cudnów. The last time he fought was against the Lubomirski rebels, suffering a defeat at Częstochowa in 1665. During his entire military career, he participated in 46 battles.

===Death===

Potocki died on 27 February 1667 and was buried in the Church of the Holy Trinity in Podhajce.

The nickname &quot;Rewera&quot; was given to Stanisław Potocki because of his frequent use of Latin words &quot;re vera&quot; (meaning &#x27;in fact&#x27;).

In his honour, his son, the future Hetman of the Crown Andrzej Potocki, founded in 1662 the city of Stanisławów.

<text>Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the U.S. Constitution, sometimes referred to as the War Powers Clause, vests in the Congress the power to declare war, in the following wording:

[The Congress shall have Power ...] To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water...

A number of wars have been declared under the U.S. Constitution, although there is some controversy as to the exact number; the Constitution does not specify the form of such a declaration.

== History and usage ==
Five wars have been declared by Congress under their constitutional power to do so: the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, the Spanish–American War, World WarI, and World WarII.

In a message to Congress on May 11, 1846, President James K. Polk announced that the Republic of Texas was about to become a state. After Mexico threatened to invade Texas, Polk amassed federal troops around Corpus Christi. When Texas became a state, federal troops moved into an area in which the new international boundary was disputed. Mexican troops moved into the same area, and both forces clashed. The President then said that &quot;after reiterated menaces, Mexico has passed the boundary of the United States, has invaded our territory and shed American blood upon the American soil. She has proclaimed that hostilities have commenced and that the two nations are now at war.&quot; Some in Congress wondered if that was actually so, including Abraham Lincoln, who wrote in a letter to his law partner:Let me first state what I understand to be your position. It is, that if it shall become necessary, to repel invasion, the President may, without violation of the Constitution, cross the line and invade the territory of another country; and that whether such necessity exists in any given case, the President is to be the sole judge... But allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so, whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose—and allow him to make war at pleasure... If, today, he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, &quot;I see no probability of the British invading us&quot; but he will say to you &quot;be silent; I see it, if you don&#x27;t.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons. Kings had always been involved and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. This our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. But your view destroys the whole matter, and places our President where kings have always stood.

US Representative Lincoln moved for a resolution issuing the President interrogatories (questions) so that Congress could determine for itself the exact &quot;spot&quot; of the conflict and whether the Congress believed it to be in the United States. However, Congress, by roll-call vote, declared war.

If it was true that the war was ongoing because the President had to repel a sudden attack, that had been contemplated by the framers in Philadelphia in August 1787, when the wording of the proposed Constitution was changed from &quot;make war&quot; to &quot;declare war&quot;. American presidents have often not sought formal declarations of war but instead maintained that they have constitutional authority (Article II, Section 2) as commander-in chief-to use the military for &quot;police actions&quot;.

The Korean War was the first modern example of the U.S. being taken to war without a formal declaration, as has been repeated in every armed conflict since. Beginning with the Vietnam War, however, Congress has given other various forms of authorization to do so. Some debate continues as to their appropriateness as well as the tendency of the executive branch to engage in the origination of such a push, its marketing, and even propagandizing or related activities to generate such support.

In light of the speculation concerning the Gulf of Tonkin Incident and the possible abuse of the authorization that followed, Congress in 1973 passed the War Powers Resolution, which requires the President to obtain either a declaration of war or a resolution authorizing the use of force from Congress within 60 days of initiating hostilities with a full disclosure of facts in the process. Its constitutionality has never been settled, and some Presidents have criticized it as an unconstitutional encroachment upon the President. In 2007, University of Virginia Professor Larry J. Sabato proposed, in his book &quot;A More Perfect Constitution&quot;, a constitutional amendment that would settle the issue by spelling out the exact powers of each branch in the Constitution itself. One counterargument is that the Constitution is a &quot;living document&quot; that has survived for over 200 years because not everything is &quot;spelled out.&quot; In the area of the War Powers Clause, the flexibility provided by the requirement for a congressional statute for a declaration of war and constitutional interpretation could be sufficient. The President could defend the country himself but not use the military offensively without Congress. That would not require a constitutional amendment or a statute like the War Powers Resolution since it has been used since 1787.

Some legal scholars maintain that offensive, non-police military actions, while a quorum can still be convened (see Continuity of government), taken without a formal congressional declaration of war is unconstitutional since no amendment has changed the original intent to make the War Powers Resolution legally binding. However, the US Supreme Court has never ruled directly on the matter and no counterresolutions has come to a vote. In the absence of a determination by the Supreme Court, the principle of separation of powers produces a stalemate on the issue.

== Constitutional convention debate ==
Pierce Butler of South Carolina was the only delegate to the Philadelphia Convention who suggested giving the executive the power to take offensive military action. He suggested that even if the President should be able to do so, he, in practice, would have the character not to do so without mass support. Elbridge Gerry, a delegate from Massachusetts, summed up the majority viewpoint saying he &quot;never expected to hear in a republic a motion to empower the Executive alone to declare war.&quot; George Mason, Thomas Jefferson, and other contemporaries voiced similar sentiments.

== War Powers Reform ==

Congress has at various points sought to reassert its constitutional responsibility over war powers decisions, including since its enactment of the War Powers Resolution in 1973. In 2021, the House Rules Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee held hearings on war powers reform, at which testified several war powers scholars and former government officials.

<text>The International Arbitration and Peace Association (IAPA) was an organisation founded in London in 1880 with the stated objective of promoting arbitration and peace in place of armed conflicts and force. It published a journal, &quot;Concord&quot;.

==Foundation==

Lewis Appleton organised the International Arbitration and Peace Association (IAPA) in 1880.
The meetings to organise the society, which began on 16 August 1880, were hosted by the municipal reformer William Phillips. Hodgson Pratt (1824–1907) was made chairman. Vice presidents included the newspaper editor John Passmore Edwards, the Duke of Westminster, the Earl of Derby and the Earl of Shaftesbury.
Unlike the Peace Society the IAPA accepted defensive war, was not restricted to Christians and claimed to be international.
It also allowed women on the executive committee, and aimed to become a tribunal that would publish findings on disputes between two countries.
In the spring of 1882 E.M. Southey, the main founder of the Ladies Peace Association persuaded her group to disaffiliate from the Peace Society and join the IAPA.
The Quaker Priscilla Hannah Peckover played a central role in organising a new ladies auxiliary of the Peace Society that was launched on 12 July 1882.

<text>Purvanchal () is the region of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Bhojpuri, Awadhi, and Bagheli are spoken. Gorakhpur and Varanasi are important cities in this region. The Lal Bahadur Shashtri International Airport in Varanasi is the largest international airport in this region.

Since the late 20th century, there has been a demand for a separate Purvanchal state, carved out of the state of Uttar Pradesh.

==History==
=== Gupta Empire ===

==== homeland ====

In some recent academic studies, the Guptas are traced to have originated from the Prayaga region, where they first established power. Goyal suggests that the Allahabad Pillar Inscription strongly indicates that the early Gupta center of power was in the modern eastern Uttar Pradesh, probably around Prayaga.

The Vishnu Purana provides an intriguing reference: &quot;Anu-Ganga Prayāgam Māgadha Guptās-cha bhokshyanti,&quot; which has been translated by Majumdar as &quot;The territory along the Ganges (up to) Prayaga will be enjoyed by the people of Magadha and the Guptas.&quot; This excerpt suggests that the Guptas were distinguished from the people of Magadha, yet both jointly ruled the region along the Ganges up to Prayaga.

Historically, the Gupta Empire emerged from the unification of the Gupta and Licchavis states, which aligns with this Purana&#x27;s reference. The text seems to imply that the Licchavis of Nepal were identified with the Magadhas, and their joint domain included Magadha and the territory stretching westward to Prayag.

In this context, the capital of the Gupta empire likely started around Magadha and Prayag and expanded from there. The concentration of early Gupta inscriptions and gold coinages around Prayag (especially of Samudragupta&#x27;s famous prasasti) tends to suggest that this region was the residence of greatest power of the Guptas. They probably controlled Sarnath in the east, and as their stronghold, they used Prayag. For the initial phase of the empire, the exact boundaries in the region above and the west is vague, but they most definitely controlled eastern Uttar Pradesh. By the late third and early fourth centuries, this area had burgeoned into a dynasty aiming to build a great empire.

Various scholarships considers Prayaga as the initial Gupta capital and supports this arguments with The Puranic references, and multiple early Gupta era inscriptions alongside the discovery of numerous coin hoards scattered around the region, further suggesting that the Guptas strengthened their sovereignty over the area prior to further expansion.

This statement was also supported by R.S. Sharma who claimed that it is highly likely the Guptas based themselves in Uttar Pradesh because from there they could expand anywhere. With Prayag as their center, they extended their rule over Anuganga (mid-Gangetic basin), Prayag (modern Prayagraj), Saketa (modern Ayodhya), and Magadha.

====Prayaga Prasasti====

Samudragupta is thought to have come to the throne in the mid-4th century CE. His precise date of coronation is not known, however, evidence from both numismatics and epigraphy bear witness that he was one of the greatest rulers of ancient India. He was an excellent statesman, a gifted poet, and a musician. As noted in the Allahabad Pillar inscription, he was also a great conqueror who unified north and central India.

In the same inscription, Sri Gupta and Ghatotkacha are given the title of Mahārāja while Chandragupta I and Samudragupta are referred to as Mahārājādhirāja, reflecting the increasing power and imperial glory of the dynasty.

==Demand for separate state==
People from the Bhojpuri region have demanded separate statehood for Purvanchal, with Varanasi or Gorakhpur as its capital and Bhojpuri as the official language of Purvanchal state.

* 1947: In 1947, a convention on Bhojpuri language and literature was held in Siwan, Bihar. The demand for a separate Bhojpuri state was first made by Rahul Sankrityayan. Later, the issue of constitutional recognition of Bhojpuri came up when the constitution came into force. Rahul demanded for a separate Bhojpuri state by joining the Bhojpuri speaking regions of Bihar, United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) and Madhya Pradesh.
*1968: The demand for a separate Bhojpuri state resurfaced in the late 1960s when the rightist organization of eastern India, Anand Marg took up the issue. The Anand Margis organized a conference at the largest cattle fair of Asia, Sonepur Mela in 1968 and raised the demand for a separate state for the Bhojpuri-speaking people.
*5 November 2006: Hundreds of Bhojpuri speaking people gathered in Bihar&#x27;s Sasaram to demand creation of a separate Bhojpuri state for those who speak the language. Meeting under the aegis of the 21st All India Bhojpuri Sahitya Sammelan they demanded the creation of a separate state and protection of the interests of the people speaking Bhojpuri.
* 1 June 2008: &quot;A separate state can ensure the security of borders as well as overall development in which the region is lagging far behind in comparison to western and central Uttar Pradesh&quot;, said Yogi Adityanath (then a BJP Member of Parliament from Gorakhpur; he became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2017).
* 7 December 2013: People associated with the Bhojpuri Andolan held a two-day convention at Taraiya in Saran district under the banner of Saran Pramandal Bhojpuri Sahitya Sammelan and demanded a separate state for Bhojpuriyas consisting of the Bhojpuri-speaking districts of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
* 2015: Thousands of people gathered at Shastri Ghat near Varuna river in Varanasi to demand the establishment of Purvanchal state with Varanasi as its capital. In this, Suhaldev Bharatiya Samaj Party&#x27;s national president Om Prakash Rajbhar said that the central and state government should stop giving false assurances. The movement has started from the revolutionary land of Varanasi, now it is not going to stop. The wheel of development has completely stopped in Purvanchal since independence. 
* 30 March 2017: BJP MP from Sasaram, Bihar, Chhedi Paswan evoked the demand of separate Purvanchal state to boost development in the Bhojpuri areas. He said that the formation of Purvanchal state is mandatory by joining the Bhojpuri speaking areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and Varanasi as its capital.
* 16 May 2017: Members of Purvanchal Rajya Jan Andolan Sanstha staged a train stop demonstration in Banaras demanding the creation of a new Purvanchal state. The agitators kept shouting slogans in support of Purvanchal state while stopping the train.

* 18 December 2021: Twenty one thousand lamps were lit at Assi Ghat in Varanasi demanding a separate Purvanchal state.
* 26 June 2023: Under the banner of &#x27;Purbiha Log Party&#x27;, people have called for uniting the people and intensifying the demand for creating a separate Purvanchal state. Under this sequence, the first meeting of the District Working Committee of Purbiha Log Party was held in Padrauna of Kushinagar district, Uttar Pradesh.
* 16 September 2023: Members of Nagrik Vikas Party took out a strong procession for the formation of Purvanchal state in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh and handed over their 13-point demand letter to the SDM for the formation of a separate Purvanchal state.

==Culture==

It is predominantly Bhojpuri-speaking region, which have several regional dialects like: Sarwariya; spoken in Gorakhpur division, Azamgarhi; spoken around Azamgarh, Kashika spoken in Varanasi divison etc. The only pure Bhojpuri (i.e., eastern Bhojpuri) speaking districts in Purvanchal are Kushinagar, Deoria, Ballia, Ghazipur and eastern half of Chandauli. Though some part of the region like Mirzapur and Sonbhadra speaks Bagheli .

<doc id="1251237" wikidata="Q977693" url="?curid=1251237" title="Synoecism">
<text>Synoecism or synecism ( ; , &quot;sunoikismos&quot;, ), also spelled synoikism ( ), was originally the amalgamation of villages in Ancient Greece into &quot;poleis&quot;, or city-states. Etymologically, the word means &quot;dwelling together (&quot;syn&quot;) in the same house (&quot;oikos&quot;).&quot; Subsequently, any act of civic union between polities of any size was described by the word &quot;synoikismos&quot;, in addition to the Latinized synoecism. Synoecism is opposed to Greek dioecism (διοικισμóς, &quot;dioikismos&quot;), the creation of independent communities within the territory of a polis.

Synoecism is the result of a few major factors, mainly an increase in population density of adjacent settlements, with an incorporation proposed for economic, political or ideological advantages, such as the synoecism of the communities of Attica into Athens, or by imposition of a ruling power, such as the synoecism of Messenia into the newly built city of Messene. Additionally, synoecism may be the result of less active forces which often take the form of shared cultural elements such as religion or language.

Although there were differences between synoecism in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, the same general concept is deduced from the history of both civilizations. Before political union, the future (combined) population of the polity constituted smaller settlements that were not obligated to each other, or at least not by the contract that was later to institute their political union. A settlement or group of settlements might be constituents of another polity from which they would be annexed or transferred.
== Classical Greece ==

=== Development ===
In ancient Greece, society was divided into the &quot;demos&quot; (δῆμοι, κῶμαι; &quot;country people&quot; or &quot;country villages&quot;) and the &quot;asty&quot; (ἄστυ) or &quot;polis&quot; (πόλις). The polis was the situs of the princely nobility, gentry, and aristocracy and the sacerdotal and martial families. The distinction between the &quot;demos&quot; and the &quot;polis&quot; was politically very important in these ancient states. There was much antagonism between the two bodies of the country and city. Where commerce and trade came to dominate culture and ideology, they encouraged men to live together in larger towns and develop democracies. In the city states of classical Greece, synoecism occurred when the &quot;demos&quot; combined with and subordinated, usually by force, the &quot;politiea&quot; in one polity.

In the &quot;poleis&quot;, the &quot;synoikistes&quot; was the person who according to tradition executed the synoecism, either by charisma or outright conquest; he was subsequently worshiped as a demi-god. Often, the &quot;synoikistes&quot; executed the synoecism in the interest of consolidating political power for themselves.

==== Theseus ====
The most famous &quot;synoikistes&quot; was the mythic and legendary Theseus, who liberated Attica from Cretan hegemony and restored the independence of Greece under the leadership of Athens. In doing so, Theseus effectively consolidated the power of several loosely related minor city-states residing in the countryside for himself by eliminating local government which took the form of small city councils and magistracies. According to Thucydides, Theseus founded a new central Prytaneion, an important building with governing administrative duties, in Athens as well as a host of other buildings with both administrative and religious duties in order to create a unified state. Thucydides also attributes Theseus with the &quot;Synoecia&quot; which translates to &quot;Feast of Union.&quot;

Koen Van Gelder recognizes that modern scholars generally disagree with this traditional foundation of Athens due to a variety of inaccuracies such as when it occurred or whether synoecism was the result of political intentions or cultural ones. The physical records of Attica and Athens have left many elements of the Theseus origin of Athens unreconcilable.Thomas has adduced arguments in support of the unity of the territory of Attica by the end of the Mycenaean period. Although her arguments seem convincing to me, they do not furnish absolute proof of a Bronze Age &quot;synoikismos&quot;; however, a political unification must have preceded the physical &quot;synoikismos&quot; at the end of the Bronze Age, or resulted from it, so that, on the threshold of the Iron Age, Athens was the only state in Attica. O. Broneer&#x27;s reflection on the large quantities of lead found in the Mycenaean fountain on the Acropolis and the Athenian hold of the Laurium must also be taking into consideration.

==== Aristotle ====
In Aristotle&#x27;s Politics, synoecism was initiated via the community. Communities would come together in order to consolidate power and legalize and enforce these shared notions of what is acceptable and what is not. To Aristotle, synoecism is what drives civilization to form governments. It begins as the union between a man and woman who create a household. Households, in turn, seek out larger networks of other connected households until the community reaches a point at which it can sustain itself in order to facilitate the enforcement of a collective good. The synoecism of Greek individuals into households, towns, and larger communities ensures a level of stability which is afforded to those who participate in the union. It is through the synoecism, according to Aristotle, that the Greeks are able to differentiate themselves from outsiders who are otherwise considered barbarians. Politics professes a fundamental belief that without the laws and justice synoecism provides, mankind is just another animal. Prevalent in Aristotle&#x27;s Politics is the concept of communal strength. Greeks on their own are considered to be weaker than if they were to act as a whole. They are vulnerable to floods and famines as well as diseases to wiping out their singular contributions to the Greek world. As a state, Greeks are instead able to produce and create above their individual ceilings.

=== Culture ===
Prior to synoecism, the people in the Greek mainland consistently shared similar ideologies and cultural beliefs. It is notable that the Greeks possessed a shared system of writing both archaically and classically which aided separate and distinguishable villages in forming larger cohesive polities. Works like Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; describe a historically united Greek front against foreigners in Anatolia and were likewise admired and celebrated universally by the Greeks. Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; even provides a historical precedent for the unity of certain Greek polities.Clan after clan poured out from the ships and huts onto the plain... innumerable as the leaves and blossoms in their season... the Athenians from their splendid citadel... the citizens of Argos and Tiryns of the Great Walls... troops... from the great stronghold of Mycenae, from wealthy Corinth... from Knossos... Phaistos... and other troops that had their homes in Crete of the Hundred Towns.There is a historical literary precedent for Greek synoecism before many of the developments in democracy or oligarchy take place in the 5th thought the 3rd century delineating the Kyklos of archaic Greece.

==== Festivals ====
Among the ancient Greeks, festivals represented opportunities to continue synoecism as well as reform or reinforce it. Festivals provided central locations to the numerous and scattered Greek city states at which information could be exchanged and social relationships maintained. The Olympics, being perhaps the largest example of synoecismatic festivals, were a pan-Hellenistic contest under which attracted Greeks at an international scale. At the games, Greeks would recognize basic similarities between themselves and other city-states through their shared enjoyment of the competitions which contributed to broader notions of synoecism through athletic representation of city-states. Individual athletes would gain notoriety and recognition for winning events for their cities. Theoretically, higher levels of visibility for city-states would grant increasing opportunities to expand sovereignty and establish themselves as real political units. Olympic truces are evidence of this effect. If one city-state were to invade or go to war with another city-state during an Olympic truce, the aggressor would not be allowed into the games. Therefore, having an athlete representative in the games meant a recognition of a city-states own sovereignty on a pan-Hellenistic scale.

==== Religion ====
In Aristotle&#x27;s Politics a responsibility of the polis is its reverence to the gods. Due to this, many religious roles were in fact elected offices and responsibilities of the deme as a whole. Successful synoecism can also be attributed to proper integration of new or reformed state religion. In 408-407 BCE the synoecism of the cities of Lindos, Ialysus, and Camirus formed the new Rhodian state. The synoecism is reflected in the selection of their eponymous priest as they were chosen from the demes of the three collective states now composing Rhodes. It is from the annual election of said priests that the synoecism of the Rhodian state can be dated precisely. 

=== Oligarchies ===
Ancient Greek states not democratically governed used the word &quot;polis&quot; in their public documents to signify sovereign power. The Doric states of Crete and Sparta preserved the polis separate from the demos. As late as the second century AD, Cretan towns continued to denote themselves with &quot;polis&quot;. Sparta, however, deviating from this use of the word, denominated itself &quot;damos&quot; (δᾶμoς) in ancient laws, because it never thought of itself as a body opposed to the Perioeci.

Müller states: &quot;In oligarchical states, as in Elis, the people in later times remained almost constantly in the country; and it frequently happened that grandfathers and grandchildren had never seen the town: there were also country courts of justice, and other regulations intended to make up for the advantages of a city life. Where the courts of justice were at a distance, and there was no inducement to mechanical industry and internal commerce (see the term banausos), the ancient habits of life continued much longer in existence.&quot;

Sometime in the early 360&#x27;s BCE the city of Megalopolis, located in Arkadia, was founded in order to coordinate a confederacy of city-states against Spartan hegemony in the region. In an effort to politically unite manage the different confederate city-state members, a council of ten oikistes was appointed to rule in the city. This inter-city effort represents a synoecism between the communities of the region into the poleis of Megalopolis with the intention of centralizing political authority.

=== Democracies===

Popular government was first established in the wealthy and populous Greek cities in Ionia. From this history the word and concept of &quot;democracy&quot; is derived. This synoecism was one of the primary causes of the Kyklos in ancient Hellas. Synoecism also occurred at Mantineia: in the fifth century, after its synoecism, it became a democracy; in the fourth century, it was again divided (&quot;dioikismos&quot;) and an oligarchy formed. Later, more political upheaval caused another synoecism, thus instituting another democracy. This further occurred in the other Arcadian towns of Tegea and Heraia.

In ancient Athens, the villages of Attica combined with the polis of Athens; consequently the &quot;demos&quot; and &quot;polis&quot; became identical in Athens and the former word assumed preference to denote the whole polity. A four tiered class system outlined by Solon on the basis of income either by the way of monetary wealth, agricultural production or otherwise was introduced in the 6th century as a way of distinguishing between citizens and the rest of the population. These four classes were again transformed under Kleisthenes into a further ten tribes as a way of further democratizing the political system and remove more power from the elite few. The general trend of Athenian power being transferred from a concentrated few to a greater and more evenly distributed percentage of the citizenry is a result of the transition from a loose group of villages to a collective singular polis. Representation of the landowning citizens helped represent the expanded interests of Athens such as navel, commercial, and agrarian ventures. The democratic nature of democracy in Athens helped the synoecism of such a populous center in Ancient Greece.

=== Mytilenean Revolt ===
In 428 BCE Mytilene sought independence from the Athenian Empire by way of a planned revolt. Despite never occurring, the revolt would have placed Mytilene at the centre of Lesbos synoecism in an effort to consolidate political power under the city&#x27;s control to the extent that the hegemony of Athens could be overthrown. The successful synoecism of Lesbos under Mytilenean oligarchs would have caused Athens to reconsider its relationship with the city due to its central organization of the isle&#x27;s resources. Unfortunately for Mytilene, Athens learned of this planned synoecism and besieged the city. Victorious Athenians then voted first for the murder of all male citizen and enslavement of women and children only to reverse their decision and committed only the leaders of the revolt. Under increased Athenian rule and observation, Mytilene was subjected to forced synoecism under Athens and its autonomy, curbed. Athenian citizens were sent to Lesbos in order to establish a stronger Athenian presence in Lesbos by collecting taxes from the Lesbians. The city walls of Mytilene were also dismantled under Athenian rule.

== Dioecism ==
A dioecism is essentially the inverse of a synoecism, the releasing of cities, towns or villages from their association with a polis. This process might manifest itself in several ways, such as the settling of new but independent communities within former territory of Constantinople on land abandoned due to a contraction of population, or the contraction of Thessaloniki out of its former neighborhoods outside the city walls due to the occupation of the countryside by the Turks. A conqueror might break up a polis for various reasons. As part of the settlement of the Third Sacred War in 346 BC, the Amphictyonic League was commissioned to destroy 21 or 22 cities of Phocis, many of which had already been burned. They chose the method of dioecism, returning the &quot;poleis&quot; to their constituent &quot;kōmai&quot;, or villages. The city fortifications were then dismantled. This relatively mild destruction was reversed by Athens and Thebes several years later as they were sympathetic to Phocis but their hands had been legally tied. The cities were re-synoecized and the larger states assisted Phocis to rebuild the fortifications.

The Spartan King Pausanias choosing the method of dioecism rather than conquest, liberated the city of Plataea and granted them an independent &quot;autonomoi&quot; status. After defeating the occupying Persians, Sparta restored Plataean autonomy and rule over their city and outlying territories differentiating them from the larger hegemony of Athens in the Attica region. This dioecism carried serious political connotations for the Spartans who invaded again during the Peloponnesian War when it was referenced again by the Plataeans as a way of warning against Spartan interference with their sovereignty or their interests. The legitimacy of the dioecism and the connotations it brought being that Plataea is an independent city-state entity from Athens was enough so that it caused the invading Spartans to enter negotiations rather than violently raze the city and its hinterlands.

== As an archaeological site ==
&quot;Synoecism&quot; also denominates an ancient Cretan archaeological site on the western fringes of Troullos. Artifacts discovered at the site include a terracotta bull figurine, a bronze statuette, and Late Minoan I pottery.

<text>Mark Vonnegut (born May 11, 1947) is an American pediatrician and author. He is the son of writer Kurt Vonnegut. He is the brother of Edith Vonnegut and Nanette Vonnegut. He described himself in the preface to his 1975 book as &quot;a hippie, son of a counterculture hero, BA in religion, (with a) genetic disposition to schizophrenia.&quot;

== Education ==
Mark Vonnegut (whom his parents named after Mark Twain) graduated from Swarthmore College in 1969. He briefly worked at Duthie Books and was also briefly chief of a 20-man detachment of special state police that provided the security for Boston State Hospital. During the Vietnam War, he filed an application with the draft board to be considered a conscientious objector, which was denied. After taking the psychological examination, he was given a psychiatric 4-F classification and avoided conscription into the U.S. military.

During his undergraduate years, he set out to become a Unitarian minister. He eventually abandoned that goal.

== Writing ==
He is the author of &quot;The Eden Express&quot; (1975), which describes his trip to British Columbia to set up a commune with his friends and his personal experiences with schizophrenia, which at that time he attributed to stress, diet and, in part, drug use. During this period, he lived mainly at the commune at Powell Lake, located 18 kilometres by boat from the nearest road or electricity. The book is widely cited as useful for those coping with schizophrenia.

On February 14, 1971, he was diagnosed with severe schizophrenia and committed to Hollywood Hospital in Vancouver. Standard psychotherapy did not help him, and most of his doctors said his case was hopeless.

Vonnegut first attributed his recovery to orthomolecular megavitamin therapy and then wrote &quot;The Eden Express&quot;. In this book, he states that &quot;approximately a third - improve without any treatment. Whatever shrink happens to be standing around when such remissions occur is usually willing to assume credit&quot;.

Vonnegut published an article in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot;, December 27, 2007, and has published several short pieces on pediatrics and other topics in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and &quot;The Patriot Ledger&quot;. He has served on the National Institute for Health Consensus Conference on ADHD since November 1999.

Vonnegut published his second book, &quot;Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So&quot;, in 2010. Like &quot;The Eden Express&quot;, it is autobiographical. His third book, 
&quot;The Heart of Caring: A Life in Pediatrics,&quot; was published in 2022.

== Medical career ==
After the publication of his first book, Vonnegut studied medicine at Harvard Medical School and later came to the conclusion that he actually had bipolar disorder. Vonnegut graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1979. After graduation, Vonnegut completed a pediatric Internship and Residency at Massachusetts General Hospital.

He has practiced pediatrics for over 40 years, opening his own practice, M.V. Pediatrics, in 2001. He was formerly a pediatrician in Quincy, Massachusetts, until his retirement in mid-2023.

== Personal life ==
He married in 1975. He had a son, Eli James Vonnegut (b. 1980).

<doc id="1251240" wikidata="Q1955326" url="?curid=1251240" title="Aesthetics of music">
<text>Aesthetics of music is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of art, beauty and taste in music, and with the creation or appreciation of beauty in music. In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (&quot;plaisir&quot; and &quot;jouissance&quot;) of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to Baumgarten in the 18th century, followed by Kant.

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy. In the 20th century, important contributions to the aesthetics of music were made by Peter Kivy, Jerrold Levinson, Roger Scruton, and Stephen Davies. However, many musicians, music critics, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between Eduard Hanslick, a music critic and musicologist, and composer Richard Wagner regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener. Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote instrumental tone poems, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music. Although history portrays Hanslick as Wagner&#x27;s opponent, in 1843 after the premiere of Tannhäuser in Dresden, Hanslick gave the opera rave reviews. He called Wagner, “The great new hope of a new school of German Romantic opera.” Thomas Grey, a musicologist specializing in Wagnerian opera at Stanford University argues, “On the Beautiful in Music was written in riposte of Wagner&#x27;s polemic grandstanding and overblown theorizing.” Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images.

Since ancient times, it has been thought that music has the ability to affect our emotions, intellect, and psychology; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The Ancient Greek philosopher Plato suggests in &quot;The Republic&quot; that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime, music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII). There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include lyricism, harmony, hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, resonance, playfulness, and color (see also musical development).

== 18th century ==
In the 18th century, music was considered so far outside the realm of aesthetic theory (then conceived of in visual terms) that music was barely mentioned in William Hogarth&#x27;s treatise &quot;The Analysis of Beauty&quot;. He considered dance beautiful (closing the treatise with a discussion of the minuet), but treated music important only insofar as it could provide the proper accompaniment for the dancers.

However, by the end of the century, people began to distinguish the topic of music and its own beauty from music as part of a mixed media, as in opera and dance. Immanuel Kant, whose &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; is generally considered the most important and influential work on aesthetics in the 18th century, argued that instrumental music is beautiful but ultimately trivial. Compared to the other fine arts, it does not engage the understanding sufficiently, and it lacks moral purpose. To display the combination of genius and taste that combines ideas and beauty, Kant thought that music must be combined with words, as in song and opera.

== 19th century ==
In the 19th century, the era of romanticism in music, some composers and critics argued that music should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole literary plot. Challenging Kant&#x27;s reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 E. T. A. Hoffmann argued that music was fundamentally the art of instrumental composition. Five years later, Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; argued that instrumental music is the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality. He felt that because music neither represents the phenomenal world, nor makes statements about it, it bypasses both the pictorial and the verbal. He believed that music was much closer to the true nature of all things than any other art form. This idea would explain why, when the appropriate music is set to any scene, action or event is played, it seems to reveal its innermost meaning, appearing to be the most accurate and distinct commentary of it.

Although the Romantic movement accepted the thesis that instrumental music has representational capacities, most did not support Schopenhauer&#x27;s linking of music and metaphysics. The mainstream consensus endorsed music&#x27;s capacity to represent particular emotions and situations. In 1832, composer Robert Schumann stated that his piano work Papillons was &quot;intended as a musical representation&quot; of the final scene of a novel by Jean Paul, &quot;Flegeljahre&quot;. The thesis that the value of music is related to its representational function was vigorously countered by the formalism of Eduard Hanslick, setting off the &quot;War of the Romantics.&quot;

This fight, according to Carl Dahlhaus, divided aestheticians into two competing groups: On the one side were formalists (e.g., Hanslick) who emphasized that the rewards of music are found in appreciation of musical form or design, while on the other side were anti-formalists, such as Richard Wagner, who regarded musical form as a means to other artistic ends. Recent research, however, has questioned the centrality of that strife: &quot;For a long time, accounts of aesthetic concerns during that century have focused on a conflict between authors who were sympathetic to either form or content in music, favouring either ‘absolute’ or ‘programme music’ respectively. That interpretation of the period, however, is worn out.&quot; Instead, Andreas Dorschel places the tension between music&#x27;s sensual immediacy and its intellectual mediations centre stage for 19th century aesthetics: &quot;Music seems to touch human beings more immediately than any other form of art; yet it is also an elaborately mediated phenomenon steeped in complex thought. The paradox of this ‘immediate medium’, discovered along with the eighteenth-century invention of ‘aesthetics’, features heavily in philosophy&#x27;s encounters with music during the nineteenth century. [...] It seems more fruitful now to unfold the paradox of the immediate medium through a web of alternative notions such as sound and matter, sensation and sense, habituation and innovation, imagination and desire, meaning and interpretation, body and gesture.&quot;

== 20th century ==
A group of modernist writers in the early 20th century (including the poet Ezra Pound) believed that music was essentially pure because it didn&#x27;t represent anything, or make reference to anything beyond itself. In a sense, they wanted to bring poetry closer to Hanslick&#x27;s ideas about the autonomous, self-sufficient character of music. (Bucknell 2002) Dissenters from this view notably included Albert Schweitzer, who argued against the alleged &#x27;purity&#x27; of music in a classic work on Bach. Far from being a new debate, this disagreement between modernists and their critics was a direct continuation of the 19th-century debate about the autonomy of music.

Among 20th-century composers, Igor Stravinsky is the most prominent composer to defend the modernist idea of musical autonomy. When a composer creates music, Stravinsky claims, the only relevant thing &quot;is his apprehension of the contour of the form, for the form is everything. He can say nothing whatever about meanings&quot; (Stravinsky 1962, p. 115). Although listeners often look for meanings in music, Stravinsky warned that these are distractions from the musical experience.

The most distinctive development in the aesthetics of music in the 20th century was that attention was directed at the distinction between &#x27;higher&#x27; and &#x27;lower&#x27; music, now understood to align with the distinction between art music and popular music, respectively. Theodor Adorno suggested that culture industries churn out a debased mass of unsophisticated, sentimental products that have replaced more &#x27;difficult&#x27; and critical art forms that might lead people to actually question social life. False needs are cultivated in people by the culture industries. These needs can be both created and satisfied by the capitalist system, and can replace people&#x27;s &#x27;true&#x27; needs: freedom, full expression of human potential and creativity, and genuine creative happiness. Thus, those trapped in the false notions of beauty according to a capitalist mode of thinking can only hear beauty in dishonest terms (citation necessary).

Beginning with Peter Kivy&#x27;s work in the 1970s, analytic philosophy has contributed extensively to the aesthetics of music. Analytic philosophy pays very little attention to the topic of musical beauty. Instead, Kivy inspired extensive debate about the nature of emotional expressiveness in music. He also contributed to the debate over the nature of authentic performances of older music arguing that much of the debate was incoherent because it failed to distinguish among four distinct standards of authentic performance of music (1995).

==21st century==
In the 21st century, philosophers such as Nick Zangwill have extended the study of aesthetics in music as studied in the 20th century by scholars such as Jerrold Levinson and Peter Kivy. In his 2014 book on the aesthetics of music titled &quot;Music and Aesthetic Reality: Formalism and the Limits of Description&quot;, Zangwill introduces his realist position by stating, &quot;By &#x27;realism&#x27; about musical experience, I mean a view that foregrounds the &quot;aesthetic properties&quot; of music and our experience of these properties: Musical experience is an awareness of an array of sounds and out the sound structure and its aesthetic properties. This is the content of musical experience.&quot;

Contemporary music in the 20th and 21st centuries has had both supporters and detractors. Theodor Adorno in the 20th century was a critic of much popular music. Others in the 21st century, such as Eugene W. Holland, have constructively proposed jazz improvisation as a socio-economic model, and Edward W. Sarath has constructively proposed jazz as a useful paradigm for understanding education and society.

===Constructive reception===
Eugene W. Holland has proposed jazz improvisation as a model for social and economic relations in general. Similarly, Edward W. Sarath has constructively proposed jazz improvisation as a model for change in music, education, and society.

=== Criticism ===
Simon Frith (2004, p. 17-9) argues that, &quot;&#x27;bad music&#x27; is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics.&quot; He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music: the Worst Records Ever Made type, which include &quot;Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can&#x27;t sing, players who can&#x27;t play, producers who can&#x27;t produce,&quot; and &quot;Tracks involving genre confusion. The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style.&quot; Another type of &quot;bad music&quot; is &quot;rock critical lists,&quot; such as &quot;Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty&quot; and &quot;Tracks that depend on false sentiment [...], that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song.&quot;

Frith gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: kitsch), and stupid. He argues that &quot;The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as &#x27;bad&#x27; is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds. And &#x27;bad&#x27; is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters&quot; (p. 28). Frith&#x27;s analysis of popular music is based in sociology.

Theodor Adorno was a prominent philosopher who wrote on the aesthetics of popular music. A Marxist, Adorno was extremely hostile to popular music. His theory was largely formulated in response to the growing popularity of American music in Europe between World War I and World War II. As a result, Adorno often uses &quot;jazz&quot; as his example of what he believed was wrong with popular music; however, for Adorno this term included everyone from Louis Armstrong to Bing Crosby. He attacked popular music claiming that it is simplistic and repetitive, and encourages a fascist mindset (1973, p. 126). Besides Adorno, Theodore Gracyk provides the most extensive philosophical analysis of popular music. He argues that conceptual categories and distinctions developed in response to art music are systematically misleading when applied to popular music (1996). At the same time, the social and political dimensions of popular music do not deprive it of aesthetic value (2007).

In 2007 musicologist and journalist Craig Schuftan published &quot;The Culture Club&quot;, a book drawing links between modernism art movements and popular music of today and that of past decades and even centuries. His story involves drawing lines between art, or high culture, and pop, or low culture. A more scholarly study of the same topic, &quot;Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde&quot;, was published five years earlier by philosopher Bernard Gendron.

<text>Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of Chiquinquirá or the Virgin of Chiquinquirá, is a Marian title of the Blessed Virgin Mary associated with a venerated image in the northern Andes region. She has been for centuries the highly appreciated patron saint of Colombia and adjacent regions of Venezuela. Under this venerated title, the image is the patron saint of Colombia, the Venezuelan state of Zulia, and the town of Caraz in Peru.

The first and original painting was made by the Spaniard Alonso de Narváe on cotton support in 1562. The second image, of smaller colonial image for Venezuela, still very venerated today, which was made in 1709 and is kept in the Basilica of Our Lady of Chiquinquirá, Maracaibo. Painted on wood, located in Maracaibo, Venezuela, where it is also called &quot;La Chinita&quot;. 

Pope Pius X in 9 January 1910 authorised the Canonical Coronation of the image but was not carried out until 9 July 1919 due to the political turmoil prevalent at the time. Pope Pius XI raised her sanctuary to the status of minor basilica via the Pontifical decree &quot;Exstat in Colombia&quot; in 18 August 1927. Pope John Paul II visited the sanctuary in 3 July 1986. 

In August 2020, the Colombian government was approved to donate a Marian image of the same namesake in the Vatican Gardens at the 18th slot.

==Colombia==

Pursuant to a commission received from Antonio de Santana, who had received in 1560 an encomienda of the Indians of Suta, a Spanish painter named Alonso de Narváez painted a portrait of the Virgin of the Rosary on a homespun piece of cotton woven by the Indians. Painting in tempera, he used mineral pigments from the soil and organic juices from local herbs and flowers.

In 1562, the portrait was placed in a chapel with a roof that leaked, and in time the humidity, air, and sun had damaged the painting, leaving the subject unrecognisable. In 1577, the worn painting was moved to Chiquinquirá and left abandoned in a room that had formerly been a family oratory. Eight years later, María Ramos, a pious Spaniard from Seville, refurbished the modest chapel and enshrined the faded painting in it. Tradition has it that the miraculous restoration of the painting occurred on Friday, 26 December 1586: scratches and holes in the cotton were gradually sealed, with light and colour overlaying them. The image stood out again, having recovered its vivacity and brightness.

The Virgin of the Rosary in the center of the painting is approximately three feet high. She looks towards her left as if to call attention to the nearly naked Christ Child in her arms. She has a calm countenance with a delicate smile. Both her face and the Child&#x27;s are pale. The Child has a small, brightly coloured bird tied to his thumb, and a rosary hangs from his left hand. A white veil covers her hair, and her rose-tinted robe is covered by a sky-blue cape. The Virgin stands on a crescent moon, suggesting she is the Woman of the Apocalypse. With the little finger of her left hand, she holds a rosary which hangs in front of her, and in her right hand is a scepter. On her right stands the figure of Saint Anthony of Padua, in the Franciscan habit and holding his usual a book with a vision of the Child Jesus atop, and on her left is the Apostle Saint Andrew, carrying his X-shaped cross. These were the patron saints respectively of Antonio de Santana, the Spanish colonist who had commissioned the painting, and the Dominican friar, Andrés Jadaque, who had arranged for De Narváez to paint it.

The figures appear blurred up close, but seem clearer when viewed from a distance. The painting has markedly deteriorated through various causes which were assessed by Cecilia Álvarez White during a technical examination of the painting in 1986. These include the lack of any prepared ground to size the cotton support, the method of painting, and the nature of the pigments used which tend to degrade after exposure to light and humidity. Álvarez White concluded that the single greatest cause of pictorial degradation occurred over the 50 years preceding her examination, when the painting was exposed to more or less continuous, intense electric light. In addition, for three hundred years the image of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá was exposed to the faithful without any protection, permitting thousands to touch the flimsy cloth. Since 1897, a thick glass cover has protected the painting from inclement weather and the excessive touch of devotees.

===Story of the prodigy===

One day in November 1709 (1749 according to other versions), a woman washing her clothes by the shores of Lake Maracaibo saw a small, wooden tablet floating towards her. She picked it up thinking it might be of some use, and took it home with her, along with the clothes. The following morning while preparing coffee, she heard knocks as if somebody was calling her. She went to see and was astonished to find the tablet shining, the image of Our Lady of Chiquinquirá now upon it. A variation says the woman first saw no more than the outline of the Virgin on the tablet, and for this reason hung it on a wall of her house; on Monday, 18 November, she heard the knocking and strange noises coming from inside her house, and saw the tablet dazzlingly bright, with lights like a rainbow. Surprised and filled with strong emotion, she ran out of her house, shouting “&quot;¡Milagro! ¡Milagro!&quot;” – hence the name &quot;El Milagro&quot; (“The Miracle”) given to the avenue where the visionary&#x27;s house stood. Later on, many people arrived to witness it.

From that day on, the inhabitants of the state of Zulia in Venezuela, where Maracaibo is situated, found their Queen in what they call “&quot;La Chinita&quot;”. As it has been expressed by many people, “She is the way that leads to Jesus”. To this day, the tablet, still bearing the image on it, can be seen in the Basilica of Maracaibo.

Legend has it that the government decided the image belonged in the capital city, Caracas, so they ordered it moved. As soldiers were to take the image away, it grew heavier and heavier until no man could lift it. The soldiers promptly returned it to the Basilica, where it has remained since.

===Wooden tablet, crown, and square===

The tablet depicting the image of the Virgin Mary was first taken to a small sanctuary built to honor San Juan de Dios and later, under the rule of the governor Francisco de la Roche Ferrer, a bigger chapel was erected to venerate the newly found image of the Virgin of Chiquinquirá. The tablet remained there until the final stage of the Basilica, the basilica was completed in 1858.

The tablet is relatively small. The dimensions are: 26 centimeters wide by 25 centimeters long and 3 millimeters deep. The Virgin Mary holds the baby Jesus in her left arm. To her left is the Apostle Saint Andrew holding an open book, and to her right Saint Anthony holding a lily (a symbol of chastity) in his right hand. The tablet was restored and preserved, and embellished with 18-carat gold engraving to magnify its beauty.

The crown suspended above the tablet weighs 10 kilograms and it was made of 18-carat gold, donated by the public. Its inner arch measures 27 centimeters by 44 centimeters and a number of precious stones were embedded. It is one of the most highly prized relics in all of Zulia. By the time the crown was made it cost around 250 thousand bolívars.

In the year 2004, the local government inaugurated the “Square of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá”, an open sanctuary reminiscent of the old times. The great monument of the Virgin of Chiquinquirá is located exactly where the washer woman&#x27;s house once was. The total area of the square is 30 thousand square meters whose epicenter is a 15-meter-high allegorical statue of the Virgin Mary. There are also three mirror-like fountains as well as a smaller square devoted to Saint Sebastian, the patron saint of Maracaibo.

===Annual celebration===

The people of Maracaibo celebrate the Chinita&#x27;s fair in November with an all-night party. One of the main city avenues, Bella Vista, is closed for several blocks and the city puts lights all along the avenue. The lights stay up for months, until after Christmas. There are stages set up, sponsored by the government and businesses around the city. There are firework shows and street vendors, and hundreds of thousands of people line the streets and celebrate all night.

The Chinita&#x27;s fair officially begins on the last Saturday in October when the Virgin is taken down from the altar in which she rests. She tours throughout Zulia State and returns to the Basilica to start all the religious festivities. Around November 6, Bella Vista Avenue sees itself lit up by Christmas decorations, and the local government promotes a series of public concerts with national and international artists to begin the “real” fair. Crowds of people flock together at the different stages or platforms devised to house such concerts.

Other cultural activities are held during the fair. Expo-Zulia is a temporary marketplace where the Zulians show numerous products that characterize the state. Many merchants, stores, companies and artisans offer their products at reasonably low prices. Bullfights are popular, with a number held in the local bullring. The “Toros coleados” finds many “gaiteros” in front of the basilica singing their best gaitas in honor of Our Lady, keeping alive a long-standing tradition of folk music.

The celebrations mark the first salvo of a long Christmas season within Venezuela.

===The 17th and 18th of November===

The last two days of La Chinita&#x27;s fair are most special. During these days the great parties around the city are held. By the afternoon of the 17th many people enjoy the multiple concerts and gaita bands that sing in the pubs, clubs and discos. The party begins on the 17th and lasts into the early morning hours of the 18th, with the “Gaitero Daybreak”. Many people go to the Chinita&#x27;s baseball game right after this traditional party and to the “Toros coleados” in the afternoon.

==Pontifical approbations==
* Pope Pius VII declared her Patroness of Colombia in 1829, with a proper liturgical feast.
* Pope Pius X granted the image a decree of Canonical coronation on 9 January 1910. The rite of coronation was executed on 9 July 1919 due to delayed preparations and political climate in the country. 
* Pope Pius XI raised her sanctuary to the status of minor basilica via the Pontifical decree &quot;Exstat in Colombia&quot; in 18 August 1927.
* Pope John Paul II visited and prayed at her shrine in 3 July 1986. 
The feast day of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquira, Patroness of Colombia is July 9, her actual day of coronation.

==Veneration==

In March 2008, the Colombian daily &quot;El Tiempo&quot; reported that a crisis that could have ended in an open conflict between Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela was averted by Colombian President Alvaro Uribe confiding the situation to the intercession of Mary under the three different titles by which she is the countries’ patroness. The crisis started on March 1, when Uribe ordered a military raid into Ecuador&#x27;s territory, against a rebel camp used by Marxist guerrillas to launch terrorist strikes. In response, Ecuador&#x27;s President Rafael Correa cut all diplomatic relationships with Colombia. Venezuela&#x27;s Hugo Chávez, Correa&#x27;s political ally, ordered a massive military surge to the Colombian border as well. Quoting Fr. Julio Solórzano, Chaplain of Colombia&#x27;s Presidential Palace, &quot;El Tiempo&quot; revealed that on March 5, with tensions increasing, President Uribe called for a Rosary to pray for the end of tensions. The Rosary, prayed at the Presidential Palace&#x27;s chapel, was dedicated, upon Uribe&#x27;s request, to Our Lady of Chiquinquira, Our Lady of Coromoto, and Our Lady of Mercy, respectively the patronesses of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. Uribe invited all officials at the Presidential palace to the Rosary, as well as the minister of Defense and the Interior. “For believers – &quot;El Tiempo&quot; wrote – the prayer was more than effective, since only two days later the presidents of the three countries shook hands, during the Group of Rio summit.” On April 7, at the Dominican Republic summit, the three presidents vented their differences, but agreed to stand down after Colombia apologized for the raid.

<doc id="1251257" wikidata="Q7198271" url="?curid=1251257" title="Pisew Falls Provincial Park">
<text>Pisew Falls Provincial Park is a provincial heritage park in the southwestern portion of Mystery Lake, Manitoba, Canada.

Located near Kwasitchewan Falls, Manitoba&#x27;s highest waterfall, Pisew Falls stands at the approximate midpoint between the small community of Wabowden and the much larger industrial and service centre of Thompson. It is also located approximately north of Winnipeg, and from Highway 6.

The name &quot;Pisew&quot; is translated from words for &quot;lynx&quot; in the local Cree language, named for the sound of the hissing water which bears a resemblance to the sounds made by the wild lynx.

Pisew Falls&#x27; creation was due to the intensive geological activity in the area hundreds of thousands of years ago, when violent tectonic effects caused the creation of first a fault, and then an upheaval of the southern side of the fault-line. This has left a rift in the landscape with a waterfall riotously cascading over and through it.

== Micro-climate ==

Because of the continuous flow of water over the falls, the localized area has developed its own microclimate. A wide variety of mosses, lichens, and fungi can be found in the immediate area around the base of the falls. There are also a variety of ferns whose origins date back to before the last ice age. The dominant winter feature downstream and to the right of the falls is the ice that builds up on top of a small island there. This island only rises a few feet above the downstream water level in summer, but by late February, the ice accumulates to approximately 3–5 metres thick from the months of freezing spray.At the periphery of this barrier between liquid water and frozen surroundings lies a thin ridge of plant growth that continues to survive throughout the harshest of the -45 degree Celsius days in this frigid northern wilderness. Normally the process of photosynthesis ceases in the surrounding area.It is common to see one or more of the local otters using the large ice buildup as a &quot;slide&quot;, providing the otters and lucky spectators with hours of amusement.

Officers of Manitoba Conservation ask that visitors keep the area clean and stay well away from the areas below the falls, which are clearly marked as &quot;Environmentally Sensitive&quot;. As long as everyone co-operates in this respect, this remarkable piece of geography will be here for many generations to come.

== Activities ==
=== Camping and hiking ===
Camping is not permitted at the falls themselves. There are no shower facilities, no electrical services, and the only toilet facilities are of the outhouse variety. There is a picnic area, and another place for a stopping if travelling further north or south.

There are two hiking trails with rugged campsites leading from the Picnic and Falls areas. The trails are very rugged, and only recommended for experienced backpackers to attempt. The trail to Kwasitchewan Falls is 22 km (about 13 miles) return.

=== Canoe and kayak ===

The campsites are accessible by water and a short portage via the Grass River and Phillips Lake.

Motorized boats over 14 ft (4 m) are generally not recommended because of the lack of boat launching facilities.

== Caution ==

There are several warnings about wildlife including bears. There are a number of black bears who reside in this area, as well as wolves, and cougars which have been spotted as far north as Thompson, Manitoba.

Due to the relatively high humidity present year-round, it is possible to slip on fresh wet greenery in the summer, and slick ice in the winter. It may be dangerous to stray too far off the clearly marked path. There has been one fatality at the falls in recent years, and a Memorial Trail-Marker is there to mark it. The ledges are steep, the fall is long, and the current below is swift. Caution is advised at all times.

<doc id="1251260" wikidata="Q934444" url="?curid=1251260" title="Richard Maibaum">
<text>Richard Maibaum (May 26, 1909 – January 4, 1991) was an American screenwriter, film producer, and playwright, best known for his work on the James Bond films. He wrote 13 of the 16 Eon Productions Bond films produced between 1962 and 1989, beginning with &quot;Dr. No&quot; and ending with &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Maibaum was born to a Jewish family in New York City. He attended New York University. In 1930, he came to The University of Iowa&#x27;s Speech and Dramatic Arts Department, where he studied under E.C. Mabie. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931, and in 1932 he received a master&#x27;s degree, all the while writing plays and acting.

==Career==
===Broadway===
He was 22 and still at the University of Iowa when his anti-lynching play, &quot;The Tree&quot;, became a 1932 Broadway production under the direction of the young Robert Rossen, later known for &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1947) and a life destroyed by the Hollywood blacklist.

Back in New York after graduation, Maibaum spent 1933 as an actor in the Shakespearean Repertory Theater on Broadway. He appeared in fifteen different roles in many productions.

As a young playwright in the early 1930s in New York City, Maibaum was involved with the challenging politics of the Depression. In 1933, the year in which Hitler ascended to his dictatorial powers in Germany, Maibaum wrote the first openly anti-Nazi play on Broadway, &quot;Birthright&quot;, also directed by Rossen. This was the first of several anti-Nazi plays to appear that year.

Maibaum then wrote &quot;Sweet Mystery of Life&quot; (1935) a stage comedy which eventually became the film &quot;Gold Diggers of 1937&quot; (1936). His rapid rise as a playwright soon earned him a contract as a writer for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, then the most powerful and prestigious studio in Hollywood.

While moving to LA and under contract to MGM, he wrote another play, &quot;See My Lawyer&quot; which was produced in New York by George Abbott and which starred Milton Berle. This was Maibaum&#x27;s most successful play, running for 224 episodes from 1939 to 1940.

===MGM===
Maibaum&#x27;s first credit was &quot;The Old School Tie&quot; (1936) at MGM. He did &quot;They Gave Him a Gun&quot; (1937) which he worked on with Cyril Hume. They worked on &quot;Live, Love and Learn&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Bad Man of Brimstone&quot; (1937) and &quot;Stablemates&quot; (1938) for Wallace Beery.

===Columbia===
At Columbia he wrote &quot;The Lady and the Mob&quot; (1938), &quot;Coast Guard&quot; (1939), &quot;The Amazing Mr. Williams&quot; (1939).

Back at MGM he did &quot;The Ghost Comes Home&quot; (1940) and &quot;20 Mule Team&quot; (1940) for Beery. He was one of many writers on Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; (1940).

Maibaum went to Paramount where he worked on &quot;I Wanted Wings&quot; (1941), a huge hit. He did some uncredited work on &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot; (1941).

At 20th Century Fox he wrote &quot;Ten Gentlemen from West Point&quot; (1942).

===World War Two===
Maibaum joined the U.S. Army in 1942 and, like many other Hollywood writers and directors, was commissioned as a captain in the Signal Corps, During his four and one-half years in the army, he produced war morale films, assembled and disseminated combat film footage (presumably while stationed overseas) and supervised a documentary history of World War II, whose title, length, whereabouts, and, indeed, purpose, are currently unknown. He eventually achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

He contributed to the story for the Olsen-Johnson film &quot;See My Lawyer&quot; (1945).

===Paramount===
With this experience under his belt, Maibaum returned to Hollywood for a contract at Paramount as a producer and screenwriter.

He wrote and produced his first picture, &quot;O.S.S.&quot; (1946), which starred Alan Ladd in a fictional story of the newly formed Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA. This was the beginning of his fruitful association with Alan Ladd.

Maibaum was producer on the John Farrow-directed &quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1948). He produced &quot;The Sainted Sisters&quot; (1948) with Veronica Lake, and &quot;Bride of Vengeance&quot; (1949) for director Mitchell Leisen.

He wrote and produced &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1949) also with Alan Ladd and co-written with Yale-educated Cyril Hume. John Farrow, original director of the project, quit after a casting dispute with Maibaum and was replaced by Elliott Nugent.

Maibaum wrote and produced &quot;Song of Surrender&quot; (1949) for Leisen. He produced &quot;Dear Wife&quot; (1949), then did two more with Leisen: &quot;No Man of Her Own&quot; (1950) and &quot;Captain Carey, U.S.A.&quot; (1950) with Ladd.

===Warwick Films===
In the 1950s, American producers Irving Allen and Albert R. Broccoli were making action films in the UK under their Warwick Films banner. When Broccoli signed Ladd on for a three-picture deal for Warwick, Ladd insisted on Maibaum co-writing the screenplays.

Maibaum moved his family to England in order to do this. The first Warwick Film, &quot;The Red Beret&quot; (1953) was a bit hit. It was followed by &quot;Hell Below Zero&quot; (1954).

He also began writing for the new medium of television, including short teleplays for &quot;The Kate Smith Evening Hour&quot;, and the critically acclaimed Emmy nominated &quot;Fearful Decision&quot; starring Ralph Bellamy and Sam Levene which he also co-wrote with Cyril Hume for &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;.

Maibaum returned to The University of Iowa in 1954 for one semester to teach and supervise the &quot;Footsteps of Freedom&quot; project, a teleplay writing course. For Warwick, he worked on the war story, &quot;The Cockleshell Heroes&quot; (1955) which starred Jose Ferrer.

Maibaum returned to Hollywood in 1955. He and Hume adapted &quot;Fearful Decision&quot; for the big screen in &quot;Ransom!&quot; (1956) with Glenn Ford.

He co-wrote &quot;Bigger Than Life,&quot; (1956) with Hume along with its star and producer, the British actor James Mason.

Maibaum did another for Warwick, &quot;Zarak&quot; (1956), directed by Terence Young and starring Victor Mature. He and Young collaborated on the script for Warwick&#x27;s &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (1958) with Mature and he did some uncredited work on Warwick&#x27;s &quot;The Man Inside&quot; (1959). He wrote some episodes of &quot;Wagon Train&quot; (1958) and provided the story for Warwick&#x27;s &quot;The Bandit of Zhobe&quot; (1959) and &quot;Killers of Kilimanjaro&quot; (1959).

===MGM TV===
Maibaum became executive producer at M.G.M.-TV in 1958, for whom he wrote and produced the TV series &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1957–59). He also produced a pilot for a TV series &quot;Maisie&quot; (1960), based on the film series, and worked on the script for &quot;The Day They Robbed the Bank of England&quot; (1960). His strong ties to the Writer&#x27;s Guild and the writing profession led him to resign in 1960 during a writer&#x27;s strike.

Maibaum wrote and produced a war film for 20th Century Fox starring Audie Murphy, &quot;Battle at Bloody Beach&quot; (1961). He then was invited by Albert Broccoli to write the first James Bond movie. And thus his future career was sealed.

===James Bond===
Maibaum was brought on to write the first Bond movie, &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), sharing credit with Johanna Harwood and Berkely Mather. He wrote the episode &quot;The Medal&quot; for &quot;Combat!&quot; (1963), then wrote &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963), sharing credit with Harwood.

Maibaum worked on &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), on which Paul Dehn also did work. He was one of several writers on &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965).

&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967) was the first Bond film on which Maibaum was not credited as a writer, the producers using Roald Dahl. Albert Broccoli wanted to produce a non-Bond movie, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), and Maibaum did some work on the script.

Maibaum received sole script credit for &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969), starring George Lazenby. He did an early draft of &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971), then the producers wanted an American writer and hired Tom Mankiewicz to rework it.

Mankiewicz was the sole screenwriter on &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973), Roger Moore&#x27;s first Bond movie. Instead, Maibaum wrote and produced a TV movie, &quot;Jarrett&quot; (1973), starring Glenn Ford.

Maibaum was brought back to the Bond movies to work on Mankiewicz&#x27;s draft of &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974). He was one of the many writers who worked on &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977), sharing credit with Christopher Wood. Maibaum was not used on &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979), the producers preferring Wood. Instead, Maibaum worked on a Bond spoof, &quot;S.H.E: Security Hazards Expert&quot; (1980).

Maibaum was brought back to work on the Bonds in association with Michael G. Wilson, Broccoli&#x27;s step-son. Their first movie together was &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981). It was followed by &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983), on which George MacDonald Fraser also did a draft; &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985), Moore&#x27;s last Bond; &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987), the first Bond from Timothy Dalton, whom Maibaum considered the best actor of the four Bonds; and &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; (1989).

Maibaum once told an interviewer that writing for Bond is &quot;a case of Walter Mitty. I&#x27;m law-abiding and non-violent. My great kick comes from feeling that I&#x27;m a pro, that I know my job, and that I have enough experience that I can write a solid screenplay.&quot;

On writing the Bonds Maibaum said &quot;The real trick of it is to find the villain&#x27;s caper. Once you&#x27;ve got that, you&#x27;re off to the races and the rest is fun.&quot; Maibaum is credited with adding the essential ingredient of humor to the James Bond films, an element lacking in the original Fleming novels.

==Death==
Maibaum continued working on Bond films until the end of his life. He died on January 4, 1991, at the age of 81, survived by his wife, Sylvia (who died in 2006), two sons, Matthew and Paul, and a granddaughter, Shanna Claire.

His papers now reside at his alma mater, the University of Iowa.

<text>Jeomchon is the urbanized center of Mungyeong city, in Gyeongsangbuk-do province, South Korea. The name literally means &quot;mountain-pass village&quot;, and may refer to the low hills that run along the edge of town. It has a population of about 45,000 (based on 2003 city residence figures ), on an area of roughly 45 km2. Jeomchon comprises roughly the five dongs known today as Jeomchon 1-dong through Jeomchon 5-dong.

Jeomchon contains the seat of Mungyeong city government, and the city&#x27;s principal bus and train stations. It is home to more than half of the city&#x27;s population, although it takes up only 5% of the city&#x27;s land, and thus also serves as a major economic center for Mungyeong.

From 1986 to 1995, Jeomchon was a separately-administered city. Its merger with Mungyeong County in 1995 created the present-day entity of Mungyeong-si.</text><links>

<doc id="1251268" wikidata="Q317207" url="?curid=1251268" title="General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge">
<text>The General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge is located at the Tablazo Strait outlet of Lake Maracaibo, in western Venezuela. The bridge connects Maracaibo with much of the rest of the country. It is named after General Rafael Urdaneta, a Venezuelan hero of Independence who was born in Maracaibo.

== Design and construction ==

Made of reinforced and prestressed concrete, the cable-stayed bridge spans from shore to shore. The five main spans are each long. They are supported from tall towers, and provide of clearance to the water below. The bridge carries only vehicles.

The competition to design the bridge started in 1957 and was won by Juan Francisco Otaola Pavan and his partner Oscar Benedetti, Venezuelan civil engineers and owners of Precomprimido C.A., with the design of Riccardo Morandi, an Italian civil engineer. While Morandi designed the bridge, it was Otaola and Benedetti who made the structural and budget calculations, which in part with Otaola&#x27;s demand for the project to be done by at least 50% of Venezuelan companies and workforce, secured the winning bid for the Venezuelan government. Precomprimido&#x27;s was the only concrete design out of twelve entries, and was expected to be less expensive to maintain, as well as providing valuable experience of prestressed concrete technology for Venezuela. Precomprimido&#x27;s construction was aided by several international companies, primarily Julius Berger as well as Grün &amp; Bilfinger, Bauboag AG, Philipp Holzmann AG, Wayss &amp; Freytag and K Ingeniería.

According to eminent bridge engineer Michel Virlogeux:

the Lake Maracaibo Bridge deserves to be part of the series of the most famous bridges over the world, with the Golden Gate Bridge, the bridge over the Firth of Forth, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Garabit Viaduct.
== History ==
It was opened on 24 August 1962 by the then-president of Venezuela Romulo Betancourt.

In April 1964, parts of the bridge collapsed after a collision with the tanker &quot;Esso Maracaibo&quot;, causing the deaths of seven people.

The construction of a second cable-stayed bridge has been proposed since 1982, with a series of studies made since 2000. The cost of the new bridge has been estimated at US$440m, to be largely privately financed via tolls.

The bridge&#x27;s structural integrity received heightened concern after the August 2018 collapse of a stayed pier on a similar bridge, Ponte Morandi in Genoa, Italy.

<doc id="1251270" wikidata="Q7752135" url="?curid=1251270" title="The Monty Python Instant Record Collection">
<text>The Monty Python Instant Record Collection is the title of two compilation albums by the Monty Python troupe. The first was released in the UK and Canada in 1977 and drew from the group&#x27;s first three studio albums, first live album, and first soundtrack album on the Charisma label, while the second was released in the US in 1981 and comprised tracks from their four albums released on the Arista label. Billed as &quot;the pick of the best of some recently repeated Python hits again, Vol. II&quot;, the record sleeve was designed by Terry Gilliam. The UK/Canadian version originally featured packaging that folded out into a cardboard box resembling a large stack of record albums (all containing spoofs of popular album names). An inner sleeve featured a spoof &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; update on the members of the Python team.

As ever, the original vinyl release of the UK version had messages from George Peckham on the runout grooves. The first side read: &quot;&quot;, while the second side read: &quot;&quot;.

The only new sketch (on the UK/Canadian versions) is &quot;Summarise Proust Competition&quot; which was originally performed on the television series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; and was re-recorded for &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Previous Record&quot; but never used, while the Alistair Cooke sketch is preceded by a brief, newly recorded introduction by Michael Palin. Many of the sketches are edited from their original versions.

<text>The siege of Metz was a battle fought during the Franco-Prussian War from August 19 to October 27, 1870 and ended in a decisive allied German victory.

The French Army of the Rhine under François Bazaine retreated into the Metz fortress after its defeat by the Germans at the Battle of Gravelotte on 18 August 1870. The fortress was promptly surrounded by German forces under Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia. The French Army of Châlons was sent to relieve the Army of the Rhine but was itself encircled and annihilated by the German armies at the Battle of Sedan on 1–2 September.

Unable to capture the fortress by bombardment or storm, the besieging Germans resorted to starving the French to submission. French attempts to break out ended in defeat at the battles of Noisseville on 31 August – 1 September and Bellevue on 7 October. French food supplies ran out on 20 October and François Achille Bazaine surrendered the fortress and the entire Army of the Rhine, some 193,000 men, into German hands on 27 October.

The annihilation of the French Army of the Rhine freed Prince Friedrich Karl&#x27;s armies for operations against French forces in the Loire river valley for the rest of the war. Metz was annexed into the German Empire after the signing of the Treaty of Frankfurt on 10 May 1871.

==Background==
After being held at the Battle of Gravelotte, Marshal Bazaine retreated into the defenses of Metz. There he was besieged by over 150,000 Prussian troops of the First and Second Armies on 19 August.

==Prelude==
Napoleon III and Marshal Patrice de MacMahon formed the new French Army of Châlons, to march on to Metz to rescue Bazaine. Napoleon III personally led the army with Marshal MacMahon in attendance. The Army of Châlons marched north-east towards the Belgian border to avoid the Prussians before striking south to link up with Bazaine. The Prussians, under the command of Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, took advantage of this maneuver to catch the French in an encirclement. He left the Prussian First and Second Armies besieging Metz, except three corps detached to form the Army of the Meuse under the Crown Prince of Saxony. With this army and the Prussian Third Army, Moltke marched northward and caught up with the French at Beaumont on 30 August. After a stiff fight in which they lost 5,000 men and 40 cannons, the French withdrew toward Sedan. Having reformed in the town, the Army of Châlons was immediately isolated by the converging Prussian armies. Napoleon III ordered the army to break out of the encirclement immediately. With MacMahon wounded on the previous day, General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot took command of the French troops in the field. The Army of Châlons was trapped and destroyed at the Battle of Sedan.

==Siege==


The French calculated they had enough food for 70,000 civilians for three and a half months and five months worth of provisions for a regular garrison. Because the entire Army of the Rhine was trapped in the fortress, the provisions only lasted for 41 days and the oats for 25. The Germans brought up 50 heavy siege guns from Germany to bombard Metz, but the fortress was too heavily stocked with artillery and well-built for it to be taken with the means available to the Germans. Unable to silence the fortress guns sufficiently to conduct siege operations, the besiegers opted to starve out the trapped French army. By September, about 25% of the 197,326-strong German siege force still lacked proper accommodations and the sick list in military hospitals grew to 40,000 men. The Germans supplemented their meat rations with tinned food. The French situation was much worse, with riots breaking out among the starving army and city residents.

The French attempted to break the siege first at Noisseville on 31 August–1 September and again at Bellevue on 7 October but were repulsed each time. Each side lost about 5,000 total men killed and wounded in these two attempts.

On 20 October, the food provisions of the fortress ran out and the French Army of the Rhine subsisted afterward on the flesh of 20,000 horses, which were consumed at a rate of 1,000 per day. Bazaine was forced to surrender his entire army on 27 October because of starvation. The Prussians offered the honors of war to the defeated French army, but, contrary to usual practice, Bazaine refused.

On 29 October, Prussian flags were raised on Metz&#x27;s outworks and the French Army of the Rhine marched out silently and in good order. They were taken prisoner by a Prussian Corps at each gate, put into bivouacs and supplied with food. The Germans allowed the French officers to keep their swords and remain in Metz, which was largely unharmed by the siege. The Germans immediately sent a train of food and live cattle to the city they had just conquered. The French prisoners were sent by way of Saarbrücken and Trier to prisoners of war camps, guarded by &quot;Landwehr&quot; battalions. Bazaine was sent as a captive to Kassel. The German 26th Brigade was stationed in Metz as garrison, with General von Kummer as commandant. Dead horses, unburied corpses and burnt or putrefying refuse greeted the German conquerors on their entry, a testament to the suffering the French had endured.

==Aftermath==

Prince Friedrich Karl and the Prussian Second Army were now free to move against the French force in the Loire area. The siege is commemorated by the &quot;Siegesmarsch von Metz&quot; which uses parts of the &quot;Die Wacht am Rhein&quot;. One notable figure present on the Prussian side was the prominent philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who served as a medical attendant. Nietzsche contracted both diphtheria and dysentery during the siege, worsening his already poor state of health.

===Casualties===
The French lost 167,000 enlisted men and 6,000 officers taken to prisoner-of-war camps on 27 October, as well as 20,000 sick who temporarily stayed behind in Metz. Material losses were enormous and amounted to 622 field guns, 2,876 fortress guns, 72 mitrailleuses, 137,000 chassepots, 123,000 other small arms, vast stores of ammunition and 56 French Imperial Eagles, all captured by the Germans. The Germans lost 5,500 enlisted men and 240 officers killed and wounded, as well as large numbers of sick.

<text>Bella Vista is located 33 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district and is part of The Hills Shire. It is a suburb in the Hills District of Greater Western Sydney and is in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Bella Vista&#x27;s Norwest Business Park is home to several Fortune 500 companies, a number of shopping centres, high-rise buildings, and industrial and recreational spaces.

==History==

In 1799 Joseph Foveaux was granted which, in addition to other purchases, he sold to John Macarthur in 1801. John Macarthur enlarged this through additional purchases until it comprised around . John and Elizabeth Macarthur farmed sheep on this property in addition to their properties at Camden and Parramatta. For much of the time that the Marm The to Elizabeth to manage the various Macarthur properties and flocks. During this time reference is made by her to &quot;my Seven Hills Farm&quot;.

Although claims are made by some that the Seven Hills Farm was used exclusively by the Macarthurs for the breeding of their merino flocks, this is clearly not the case as the documentary evidence of the Macarthur papers shows that their Merino rams were paddocked at &quot;Elizabeth Farm&quot; at Parramatta. The Seven Hills farm was isolated and stock there were always in danger from theft and aboriginal attack. Two of Macarthur&#x27;s stockmen were killed on the farm by Indigenous Australians in 1805. In fact the sheep at the Macarthur&#x27;s Seven Hills farm had their genesis in the 600 sheep which were purchased from Foveaux at the same time as the property. What can justifiably be claimed about the site is that it was one of the first major Australian sheep breeding farms and that the results later achieved at Camden with fine merino sheep only followed Elizabeth&#x27;s efforts at Seven Hills. Part of this land was later acquired by the Pearce family and became known as &quot;Bella Vista&quot;.

All the buildings on the site today date from this period of its history with no extant buildings from the Macarthur period. In the 1890s, Edward Henry Pearce (1839–1912) of &quot;Bella Vista&quot; was declared the &quot;largest and most successful orange grower in the colony.&quot; &quot;Bella Vista&quot; was sold by the Pearce family in 1950.

Until the mid-1990s, the area was primarily used for small-scale agriculture. Since then, significant changes have become apparent as it incorporates a residential area and a busy business district. However, the homestead and old farm buildings have been preserved and this portion of the former Pearce family property is now owned by The Hills Shire Council. The Friends of &quot;Bella Vista&quot; Farm Park has been formed and they are working actively to achieve the continued restoration of all buildings on this unique site.

== Heritage listings ==
Bella Vista has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Elizabeth Macarthur Drive: &quot;Bella Vista&quot; (homestead)
*Seven Hills Road: Pearce Family Cemetery

==Demographics==
According to the , there were 8,384 residents in Bella Vista. 48.4% of residents were born in Australia. The other most common countries of birth were, India 10.7%, China 8.7%, Sri Lanka 4.5%, the Philippines 2.1% and England 1.9%. 43.7% of residents spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 12.1%, Hindi 5.1%, Tamil 4.7%, Cantonese 4.3% and Punjabi 4.1%. The most common responses for religious affiliation were No Religion 23.2%, Catholic 21.1%, Hinduism 15.6%, and Islam 5.4%.

==Commercial area==
The suburb has shopping complexes and a major hotel. It is rapidly becoming the main business centre within the Hills District. The biggest commercial area is the Norwest Business Park on Norwest Boulevard to the east. Norwest Business Park incorporates retail, commercial, industrial and hotel developments. The industrial areas in West Bella Vista are still heavily under development, with many new warehouses appearing recently.

===Health services===
Bella Vista has numerous established medical centres and dental surgeries, including Norwest Private Hospital on Norbrik Drive, and Hospital for Specialist Surgery located on Solent Circuit.

===Shopping centres===
Circa Retail is a shopping centre located near Old Windsor Road, featuring a Woolworths supermarket as the anchor tenant with 25 specialty stores.

===Corporate hub===
In 2006, Woolworths, a public Australian retail company, joined all of its sub-management offices into a $200 million complex in Norwest Business Park in Bella Vista, where their headquarters are now located. Homeart, another Australian retail chain, is also headquartered in Bella Vista.

==Transport==
A major factor in the recent growth of Bella Vista has been its prime location near the end of the Sydney M2 motorway. The motorway (opened in 1997) means that in very good traffic conditions it takes just over half an hour to get from Bella Vista to the CBD. This also puts Bella Vista close to two major north–south transport routes through Sydney, the Cumberland Highway and the Westlink M7.

Until the completion of the Sydney Metro Northwest buses were the only form of public transport available to Bella Vista residents. The suburb is serviced by private bus companies Busways and CDC NSW. Relatively frequent buses connect Bella Vista with the nearby hubs of Parramatta (bus numbers 660, 662, 663, 664 and 665), Castle Hill (bus numbers 730 and 662), Blacktown (bus number 730) and Seven Hills (bus numbers 714 and 715). There are also peak services available directly to St Marys (745), and the CBD (bus numbers 607X, 613X, and 614X). Many routes use the North-West T-way.

Two railway stations now service the area. Bella Vista railway station is located on the corner of Lexington Drive and Old Windsor Road, whilst Norwest railway station is located in the suburb of Norwest near Hillsong Church across the road from the Norwest Market town shopping centre. The Sydney Metro Northwest is now the main public transport line linking residents of north-western Sydney with Epping, Chatswood, North Sydney and the Sydney CBD. It has also improved access to Castle Hill, Norwest Business Park and Rouse Hill.

==Education==
Bella Vista is close to many educational institutions including:
* Bella Vista Public School
* Baulkham Hills High School
* Crestwood High School
* Crestwood Public School
* Gilroy Catholic College
* Glenwood High School
* Hillsong Church operates the Hillsong International Leadership College

<text>Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown () is a 1988 Spanish black comedy film written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar, starring Carmen Maura, Antonio Banderas and Julieta Serrano. The plot follows actress Pepa, who, after her lover Iván leaves without explanation, sets out to find the reason, and comes across an array of eccentric characters, including Iván&#x27;s son from a previous relationship and her best friend Candela, who has been held captive by a Shiite terrorist cell.

The film brought Almodóvar to widespread international attention: it was nominated for the 1988 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and won five Goya Awards including Best Film and Best Actress in a Leading Role for Maura. It debuted at the 45th Venice International Film Festival and was released on 11 November 1988 in the United States.

&quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; received acclaim from critics and audiences alike, and is often considered one of Almodóvar&#x27;s best films. A stage musical opened on Broadway in 2010, adapted by Jeffrey Lane with songs by David Yazbek.

==Title==
The Spanish title refers to an &#x27; (attack of the nerves), inexactly translated into English as &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; (&#x27;). &quot;&quot; are culture-bound psychological phenomena during which the individual, most often female, displays dramatic outpouring of negative emotions, bodily gestures, occasional falling to the ground, and fainting, often in response to receiving disturbing news or witnessing or participating in an upsetting event. Historically, this condition has been associated with hysteria and more recently in the scientific literature with post-traumatic stress and panic attacks.

==Plot==
Pepa and Iván are voice actors who dub foreign films, most recently &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; with Joan Crawford and Sterling Hayden. Depressed because Iván has left her, Pepa oversleeps, missing a recording session with Iván, and receiving a voicemail message from him asking her to pack his things in a suitcase he will pick up. Arriving at work late after Iván has left, Pepa spends the rest of the day desperately trying to give him an important message.

Returning home, Pepa finds her answering machine filled with frantic messages from her friend, Candela. Exasperated, Pepa rips out the phone, throwing it through the glass doors onto the terrace. Hoping for an eventual visit from Iván, who loves gazpacho, she prepares gazpacho spiked with sleeping pills. Candela arrives; before she can explain her dire situation, Carlos arrives with his pushy and snobbish fiancée Marisa. Apartment-hunting, they coincidentally have come to tour Pepa&#x27;s penthouse. Carlos and Pepa figure out that Carlos is Iván&#x27;s son with Lucía, Iván’s ex-wife, and that Pepa is Iván’s lover of three years. Carlos does not know where Iván is. Meanwhile, a bored Marisa helps herself to gazpacho from the refrigerator, unaware it is spiked; she sleeps on a lounge chair on the terrace for the next several hours. 

An ignored and desperate Candela tries to kill herself by jumping off the balcony but hangs by her hands and is rescued. Candela explains that she unknowingly had an affair with a man who turned out to be a Shiite who brought friends from his terrorist cell to stay. They are planning to hijack a flight to Stockholm that evening and divert it to Beirut. When the terrorists left, Candela fled; she fears that she will be implicated as an accomplice. On Carlos&#x27;s recommendation, Pepa goes to consult a lawyer who is handling his mother’s divorce from Iván. The lawyer, Paulina, behaves strangely and refuses to help Pepa, who sees plane tickets to Stockholm that evening on Paulina’s secretary’s desk. 

Learning of the planned hijacking, Carlos fixes Pepa’s phone, calls the police, and hangs up before (he believes) they can trace the call. With Marisa still asleep, Carlos kisses Candela. When Pepa returns, Lucía calls to say that she is coming to confront her about Iván. Carlos warns that Lucía has recently been released from a mental hospital. Tired of Iván, Pepa throws his suitcase in the trash, barely missing him as he arrives with Paulina, the lawyer who is involved with Iván, her client’s husband. Not wanting to confront the furious Pepa, Iván leaves a voicemail message.

Hearing Carlos playing Lola Beltrán&#x27;s &quot;Soy infeliz&quot;; Pepa throws the record out the window, which hits Paulina like a frisbee. Pepa hears Iván&#x27;s message, rips out the phone again, and throws the answering machine out the window, hitting the couple&#x27;s car. Lucía arrives at the same time as the telephone repairman and the police, who traced Carlos&#x27; call. Candela panics, but Carlos serves the spiked gazpacho. The policemen and repairman are knocked out, and Carlos and Candela fall asleep on the sofa. Lucía aims a policeman&#x27;s gun at Pepa, saying that she was released from the mental institution when she faked sanity after hearing Iván&#x27;s voice dubbed on a foreign film. Pepa figures out that Iván is going to Stockholm with Paulina, and the terrorists are planning to hijack their flight. Deciding to kill Iván, Lucía throws her gazpacho in Pepa&#x27;s face and leaves. Lucía hijacks a motorcycle by hopping behind the biker, forcing him at gunpoint to drive her to the airport.

Pepa chases Lucía in a cab with her neighbor, Ana (the hijacked biker’s girlfriend). At the airport, Lucía sees Iván and Paulina at security and aims her gun at them. Pepa thwarts the murder attempt by rolling a luggage cart at Lucía, before fainting. As the police arrest Lucía, Iván rushes to Pepa&#x27;s aid and offers to talk things out with her. Declaring it is now too late, Pepa leaves. Returning to her messy home, full of unconscious people, Pepa sits on her terrace, where Marisa has just awakened. The women chat, sharing a moment of tranquility, and Pepa finally reveals what she wanted to tell Iván: she is pregnant.

==Cast==
==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was the highest-grossing Spanish film of all-time in Spain with a gross of 1.1 billion pesetas, surpassing &quot;La vaquilla&quot; (1985), equivalent to US$8 million. It was also the most successful Spanish film in the United States at the time, with a gross of $7.2 million.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; finds writer-director Pedro Almodóvar working in a distinctly feminist vein, with richly rewarding results.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 85 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The film was ranked number 78 on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; list in 2010.

Nils Gollersrud comments that &quot;Almodóvar&#x27;s signature formula of gaudy, ironic, genre-bending storytelling had achieved a symbiosis of sorts, presenting a more confident and satisfying version of his unique cinematic vision that his earlier, rougher films had not yet achieved&quot;.

<doc id="1251288" wikidata="Q11925241" url="?curid=1251288" title="Harit Pradesh">
<text>Harit Pradesh is a proposed new state of India comprising the western parts of the state of Uttar Pradesh. The etymology derives from &quot;harit&quot;, meaning &#x27;green&#x27;, and &quot;pradesh&quot;, meaning &#x27;state&#x27;. Other proposed names include Braj Pradesh (which would include only parts of this region) and Paschim Pradesh. It consists of an area of 79,832 km2, which is 33.14% of UP and a population of 7.42 crores, which is roughly 35-36% of UP.

The region has some demographic, economic and cultural patterns that are distinct from other parts of Uttar Pradesh, and more closely resemble those of Haryana, Punjab and North Rajasthan areas. For instance, dialects of Hindi spoken here (Khadiboli and Braj Bhasha) are distinct from Bhojpuri spoken in Purvanchal and Awadhi in Central UP. Similarly, some of the festivals like Chhath puja are also significantly more popular in Purvanchal compared to Western Uttar Pradesh.

==Proposed capital==
Meerut has been constantly proposed as the capital of this state by many leaders, including Dr. B.R Ambedkar, former Chief Minister Mayawati, and Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan. However, possibility of making a Tricity type of capital near Agra is also there. When the reorganisation happens, some other city may also emerge as the capital of state. Due to industrialisation and presence of infrastructure there are plenty of good candidates for a state capital in this region.

==History==
In his 1955 critique of the proposed States Reorganisation Act, &quot;Thoughts on Linguistic States&quot;, Dr. B. R. Ambedkar had advocated the division of Uttar Pradesh into three states – Western, Central, and Eastern, with capitals at Agra, Kanpur and Prayagraj, respectively – in order to prevent excessively large states from dominating politics at the national level.

Later, socialists like Ram Manohar Lohia, Jayaprakash Narayan and Acharya Kripalani favoured a re-drawing of the administrative map of India. However, Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister at the time, supported the States Reorganisation Commission&#x27;s (SRC) recommendation of re-forming states on a linguistic basis. K.M. Panikkar, in his dissenting note to the SRC report, however, opposed linguistic states and preferred the formation of a state of western Uttar Pradesh.

In 1972, fourteen MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh state assembly supported an unsuccessful resolution to divide the state into three units (Braj Pradesh, Awadh Pradesh and Purvi Pradesh). A similar resolution, however, was successfully passed from the state assembly in 2011 under then Chief Minister Mayawati.

== Regional disparities ==
Western UP alone accounts for more than 50% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Uttar Pradesh. By comparison, Bundelkhand contributes just 5.2%, Central UP 17.52% and Eastern UP 28%. Out of top 10 districts that contribute the most to state GSDP, 7 are from Western UP. In terms of Per Capita Gross District Domestic Product (GDDP) as well, 7 out of top 10 districts in the state are from Western UP. These include (in descending order):

In FY 21–22, the total GDDP of Western UP region on market prices was 9.44 lakh crores while that of entire UP was 19.17 lakh crores. Constant GDDP of Western UP during the same period was 5.89 lakh crores, and for entire UP it was 11.81 lakh crores. Based on these figures, the per capita GDDP of Western UP turns out 79,425.47 INR, much higher than that of all UP at around 59,065 INR.

Western UP is also ahead of the rest of UP in terms of infrastructure, industrialisation, urbanisation, and overall quality of life. Some of its cities (i.e. Noida and Greater Noida) are on par with largest metro cities of the country. Even among smaller cities the quality of life is better compared to the rest of UP, as most of them are Tier-2 cities. Nine out of 15 tier-2 cities in the state are in Western UP.

Additionally, Western UP also accounts for almost 54% of all court cases reaching Allahabad High Court, which is on average around 500 km away from the cities of this proposed state and requires travelling all day for a simple hearing. Residents of western Uttar Pradesh have been demanding a high court bench in Meerut from a long time, but so far it hasn&#x27;t been heard.

These huge economic disparities give people in Western UP a sense of having to pay up for the economic backwardness of other regions in their state. Additionally, the prospect of being clubbed with economically backward state of Bihar in general conversation with terms like &quot;UP-Bihar&quot;, despite having a far more developed and advanced economy than Bihar, also doesn&#x27;t go down well with the people in this region. These feelings, when combined with cultural differences and other incidents, such as having to struggle for a high court bench for decades, and allegations of lower allocations in state budget, further increase the discontent among politically aware people of the state, thus fuelling the demand for statehood of this region.

==Proponents and opponents==

=== Political parties and leaders ===
Among the most prominent advocates for the creation of the new state in recent days have been BSP Supremo Mayawati and Late Chaudhary Ajit Singh, the son of former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh and leader of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).

After coming to power, Mayawati wrote letters to the prime minister three times in 2007, March 2008, and December 2009 regarding partitioning of Uttar Pradesh. In November 2011, Mayawati&#x27;s cabinet also passed a resolution in State assembly to partition the state into four different states—Harit Pradesh, Awadh Pradesh, Bundelkhand and Purvanchal—for better administration and governance. However, since creating states is the domain of Central Government and the proposal wasn&#x27;t actively taken by the UPA Government of that time, it couldn&#x27;t be implemented.

Similarly, RLD also pushed for the statehood of Harit Pradesh in 2011. Pushpendra Singh, former General Secretary of Youth wing of RLD, even launched a political party called Harit Pradesh Party to demand the creation of a separate state of Western Uttar Pradesh. In 2011, Chaudhary Ajit Singh of RLD said:&quot;&quot;Western UP contributes to a large chunk – nearly 72% – of the state&#x27;s total income. In turn, what western UP gets is not enough. Just 18% of the state&#x27;s budget is spent on developing west UP. This anomaly, understandably, makes the people of this area dissatisfied&quot;.&quot;He also alleged that in most years, funds allocated to west Uttar Pradesh were never spent.

Other Jat leaders, such as Om Prakash Chautala in Haryana, the leader of the Indian National Lok Dal, have also made efforts to involve themselves in the politics of creating a separate state.

Of the other main political forces in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party has opposed the proposal, while the Indian National Congress and BJP have adopted a non-committal stance. Individual leaders of both Congress as well as BJP, however, have time and again spoken in favour of the statehood for Harit Pradesh. For instance:

* After the Congress working committee passed a resolution to recommend the creation of Telangana on 31 July 2013, Jairam Ramesh suggested that Uttar Pradesh&#x27;s reorganisation was necessary as it is difficult to run such a big state effectively. He said:

&quot;From an administrative point of view, a state of over 200 million people, 75 districts, over 800 blocks ... It&#x27;s just not governable. It is my personal view...Its politics is a separate issue.&quot;

* Similarly, BJP leader Sanjeev Balyan also said while attending a university event in Meerut that Harit Pradesh should be a separate state with Meerut as its capital. He clarified though that this is his personal opinion and not the official party line. 
In April 2024, while campaigning for Lok Sabha elections Mayawati again raised the issue of statehood for Western Uttar Pradesh, promising to take &quot;concrete steps&quot; for the same if her government came to power.

=== Communities ===
The creation of three new states in 2000 (Jharkhand from the division of Bihar, Uttarakhand from the division of Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh from the division of Madhya Pradesh) gave new impetus to the demand for Harit Pradesh among communities. The support further increased after formation of Telangana out of Andhra Pradesh in 2013. The Jats of this region, who are a dominant political and agricultural community spread across Pakistan, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, have found themselves in a &quot;politically disadvantageous position&quot; in western Uttar Pradesh. Therefore, they are largely in support of statehood for Harit Pradesh.

Also, since the Muslim population in western Uttar Pradesh (24%, according to 2011 census) is higher than in Uttar Pradesh as a whole (17%), the proposal has found support from Muslim organisations as well.

==Geography==

===Soil conditions===
Western Uttar Pradesh&#x27;s soil and relief has marked differences from that of the eastern part of the state. The soil tends to be lighter-textured loam with some occurrences of sandy soil. Some loess soil is continuously deposited by winds blowing eastwards from Rajasthan&#x27;s Thar Desert.

===Precipitation===

Harit Pradesh receives rain through the monsoon and western disturbances. The monsoon carries moisture northwards from the Indian Ocean, occurs in late summer and is important to the Kharif or autumn harvest. Western disturbances carry moisture eastwards from the Mediterranean Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean. They primarily occur during the winter season and are important for the main staple of the region, wheat, which is classified as a rabi crop.

==Demographics==
===People of Harit Pradesh===
According to the 2011 census of India, the total population of Western Uttar Pradesh is 71,740,055 people. It is composed of a varied set of communities and tribes, including Tyagis, Jats , Yadavs, Gurjars, and Rajputs. 

Yadavs have a very small presence in this region. Jat and Brahmins, including Tyagis, make up to 30% of the population of the western region of Uttar Pradesh. The region&#x27;s Jat are descended from immigrant groups from centuries ago, and a large subregion of western Uttar Pradesh, Jatland, takes its name from that Jats tribe. Sikh Jats came from West Punjab, who migrated from Pakistan after partition, also settled in this area in large numbers.

==Administrative divisions==

Western Uttar Pradesh includes 30 districts in seven divisions:

# Saharanpur division: Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli districts
# Moradabad division: Moradabad, Bijnor, Rampur, Amroha, Sambhal districts
# Bareilly division: Bareilly, Badaun, Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur districts

<text>Joe Spina (born September 21, 1946) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003, representing a Brampton-area riding for the Progressive Conservative Party.

==Background==
Spina was educated at the University of Windsor, receiving a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1975. He was the owner and president of Amplexus Communications from 1981 to 1995 and served as president of the Brampton Board of Trade in 1989-90. He was also a founding chair of the Brampton and Vaughan Santa Claus Parades.

==Politics==
Spina was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating incumbent Liberal Carman McClelland by just over 5,000 votes in the riding of Brampton North. This riding is located in &quot;905 belt&quot;, a suburban region which provided the Ontario Tories with their strongest support base in this period.

On two occasions during his first term in office, Spina attracted controversy for making inflammatory comments while heckling opposition members speaking in the legislature. On November 6, 1996, while Marilyn Churley was speaking about the government&#x27;s handling of a proposed new school breakfast program, Spina yelled &quot;Why don&#x27;t you go home and take care of your own kids?&quot;, and on November 18, 1996 he yelled at Gilles Bisson to &quot;Speak English!&quot; while Bisson was making a speech in French to mark the tenth anniversary of Ontario&#x27;s &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;.

He increased his margin of victory in the 1999 provincial election in the redistributed riding of Brampton Centre, defeating Liberal candidate Gurjit Grewal by over 10,000 votes. In 2000, he supported Stockwell Day&#x27;s bid to lead the Canadian Alliance on the second ballot of the new federal party&#x27;s leadership vote. Spina served as a backbench supporter in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves. He served as parliamentary assistant to six cabinet ministers. In 2001, he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill attempting to increase public awareness of congenital heart defects. He supported Tony Clement, then Jim Flaherty for the party&#x27;s leadership in 2002.

In the 2003 provincial election, he was defeated by Liberal candidate Linda Jeffrey by 1,005 votes.

In the Canadian federal election of 2004, Spina ran for the Conservative Party of Canada in the riding of Vaughan against high-profile Liberal incumbent Maurizio Bevilacqua. He was defeated, losing to Bevilacqua by almost 20,000 votes.

<text>Hodgson Pratt (10 January 1824 – 26 February 1907) was an English pacifist who is credited with founding the International Arbitration and Peace Association in 1880.

==Early life==
Born at Bath, Somerset on 10 January 1824, he was the eldest of five sons of Samuel Peace Pratt by his wife Susanna Martha Hodgson (d. 1875). After education at Haileybury College (1844–6), he matriculated at London University in 1844. In 1847 he joined the East India Company&#x27;s service at Calcutta. He became under-secretary to the government of Bengal, and inspector of public instruction there. While in India Pratt in 1851 helped to found the Vernacular Literature Society which published Bengali translations of English literature, and acted as secretary till 1856. He also started a school of industrial art. In 1857 Pratt was at home on leave and at contributed to &quot;The Economist&quot; on Indian matters. He finally left India in 1861.

==Co-operator and advocate of arbitration==
Settling in England, Pratt became involved in the co-operative movement, in association with Vansittart Neale, Thomas Hughes, and George Jacob Holyoake. He met Henry Solly in 1864, and became a member of the council of the Working Men&#x27;s Club and Institute Union founded by Solly in June 1862. For it he travelled up and down the country, and was its president from 1885 to 1902. With Solly he also started trade classes for workmen in St Martin&#x27;s Lane in 1874. That year he also chaired a conference on the ideas of Emma Paterson, in July.

Pratt was a champion of international arbitration. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 he pleaded for the peaceful settlement of the dispute. Two years later he joined in an appeal for the release of Élisée Reclus who had taken part in the Paris Commune. In 1880 he joined William Phillips and others in founding the International Arbitration and Peace Association, becoming first chairman of the executive committee. Four years later (1 July 1884) he founded, and initially edited, the association&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; (later &quot;Concord&quot;). On behalf of the association he travelled in Europe, and he took part in international peace congresses at Paris and elsewhere from 1889 onwards.

==Last years==

Friends nominated Pratt for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906, when it went to Theodore Roosevelt. He had become a convinced socialist suffered from poor eyesight, and spent the last years of his life at Le Pecq. Seine et Oise, France, where he died on 26 February 1907. He is buried on the main north-south path of the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery. Jeremy Beadle has since been buried immediately in front of his memorial.

The Annual Hodgson Pratt Memorial Lecture and travelling scholarship for working men, as well as prizes, were established in 1911.

==Works==
For the International Arbitration and Peace Association, Pratt translated Élie Ducommun&#x27;s &quot;The Programme of the Peace Movement&quot; (1896) and he summarised in English as &quot;The Organisation of International Arbitration&quot; (1897) a work of Édouard Descamps.

==Family==
Pratt married:

# in 1849 Sarah Caroline Wetherall, daughter of an Irish squire; and
# in 1892 Monica, daughter of the Rev. James Mangan. She survived him with one daughter.

==Memorials==

Hodgson&#x27;s name is listed on the south side of the Reformers Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

<text>Benton MacKaye ( ; March 6, 1879 – December 11, 1975) was an American forester, planner and conservationist. He was born in Stamford, Connecticut; his father was actor and dramatist Steele MacKaye. After studying forestry at Harvard University, Benton taught there for several years. He held positions in the U.S. Forest Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the U.S. Department of Labor; he was also a member of the Technical Alliance where he participated in the &quot;Energy Survey of North America&quot;.

MacKaye helped pioneer the idea of land preservation for recreation and conservation purposes and was a strong advocate of balancing human needs and those of nature; he coined the term &quot;geotechnics&quot; to describe this philosophy. In addition to writing the first argument against urban sprawl, MacKaye also authored two books, &quot;The New Exploration: A Philosophy of Regional Planning&quot; and &quot;Expedition Nine: A Return to a Region&quot;. Thirteen of his essays were published in the collection &quot;From Geography to Geotechnics&quot;. A co-founder of The Wilderness Society, he is best known as the originator of the Appalachian Trail, an idea he presented in his 1921 journal article entitled &quot;An Appalachian Trail: A Project in Regional Planning.&quot; The Benton MacKaye Trail, some portions of which coincide with the Appalachian Trail, is named after him.

==Early life==
Emile Benton MacKaye was born in Stamford, Connecticut, on March 6, 1879, to actor and dramatist Steele MacKaye and his wife Mary. He was the sixth of seven children (and last son) born to the couple. His siblings were Arthur Loring MacKaye (1863–1939), Harold (Hal) Steele (1866–1928), William Payson (1868–1889), James (Jamie) Medbery (1872–1935), Percy (1875–1956), and Hazel (1880–1944). Benton&#x27;s name was derived from his paternal grandmother, Emily Benton Steele. The family often suffered from financial troubles because of the patriarch&#x27;s numerous failed business ventures; although the Stamford home where Benton was born and where the family had lived since 1875 was a comfortable one, in late 1879 the family began a restless series of moves due to lack of funds. They lived in farms and houses in Brattleboro, Vermont; Norton, Massachusetts; Mount Vernon, New York; and Ridgefield, Connecticut, before moving to New York City in 1885.

In order to escape the bustle of city life, the family took to visiting Shirley Center, Massachusetts, a quiet village 30 miles from Boston that Benton would continue to visit throughout his life. In 1888, his brother William purchased an estate in Shirley that the family would come to call &quot;The Cottage&quot;. Eight-year-old Benton was enamored with the beauty and freedom of the country, proclaiming he enjoyed it far more than urban existence. Shortly after William died of a sudden respiratory disease in 1889, the family moved to Washington, D.C. An indifferent student, MacKaye once described school as &quot;a place that boys like to run away from&quot;. Drawn to the study of the natural world, he often pursued knowledge on his own; he spent much time in the Smithsonian, making sketches of the abundant collections and volunteering to help scientists in their labs. He befriended assistant curator James Benedict and attended lectures given by Civil War hero John Wesley Powell and arctic explorer Robert Peary.

His early immersion in nature helped him cope with tragedy that eventually struck the MacKaye family; his frequently absent father died in 1894, when Benton was fourteen. While attending high school in Cambridge, he began charting the landscape around Shirley Center, documenting vegetation, landforms, rivers, and roads in numbered notebooks. Lewis Mumford, a close friend of MacKaye and his future biographer, wrote that &quot;This direct, first-hand education through the senses and feelings, with its deliberate observation of nature in every guise—including the human animal—has nourished MacKaye all his life.&quot;

==Harvard and forestry==
After dropping out of school in order to prepare for college entrance exams on his own, in 1896 MacKaye followed his brothers—James, an engineer and philosopher, and Percy, a dramatist and poet—to Harvard University, where he studied geology. It took him two years to overcome deficiencies in subjects such as German, algebra and physics. When he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1905, MacKaye was still unsure what career he should embark upon. During this time, he read Thomas Henry Huxley&#x27;s 1877 work &quot;Physiography: An Introduction to the Study of Nature&quot;—a gift from his brother James and a work that would prove influential in MacKaye&#x27;s future regional planning. In 1903 he enrolled in Harvard&#x27;s newly established forestry school; he was the school&#x27;s first student to graduate in 1905. For the next five years, he alternated between teaching at Harvard&#x27;s forestry school near Petersham, Massachusetts, and working as a forest assistant with the United States Forest Service.

MacKaye made some important contributions during the early years of national forestry. While working as a forest examiner in the 1910s, he performed groundbreaking research on the impacts of forest cover on surface runoff in New Hampshire&#x27;s White Mountains. This was during a time in which an intense debate regarding the connection between deforestation and irregular streamflow was occurring, and MacKaye&#x27;s scientific evidence that forest cover controlled streamflow helped in the creation of the White Mountain National Forest.

In 1913, while living in Washington D.C., Mackaye helped form a social activist group called the Hell Raisers. Composed of government workers, congressional staffers, and journalists, the informal group aimed to raise public awareness about social and political issues. He married the suffragist Jessie Belle Hardy Stubbs in 1915.

==Hiking trails==

MacKaye&#x27;s article &quot;An Appalachian Trail: A Project in Regional Planning,&quot; which proposed the construction of the Appalachian Trail, was published in the October 1921 issue of &quot;&quot;. The article was partly inspired by the Green Mountain Club which had helped usher in Vermont&#x27;s Long Trail. The article triggered sixteen years of effort, organized through hundreds of local trail associations and community groups, to blaze and build a 2,192-mile trail along the crests of the Appalachian Mountains.

The Pinhoti National Recreation Trail is considered the realization of MacKaye&#x27;s original 1921 vision of a trail extending the length of the Appalachian Mountain chain, connecting several existing trails and sprinkled with permanent camps to &quot;stimulate every line of outdoor non-industrial endeavor,&quot; including recreation, recuperation, agriculture and study. MacKaye hoped to spark a &quot;back to the land&quot; movement to relieve the ills of urban industrial life.

==Legacy==
In his 2002 book &quot;Long Trails of the Southeast&quot;, writer and avid hiker Johnny Molloy wrote that the Benton MacKaye Trail &quot;is what I imagine the Appalachian Trail was like many decades ago—a lesser tamed path, steep in places, rough in spots, and still evolving&quot;.

On June 17, 2011 he was inducted into the Appalachian Trail Hall of Fame at the Appalachian Trail Museum as a charter member.
