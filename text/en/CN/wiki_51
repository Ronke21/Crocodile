<text>The Selk&#x27;nam, also known as the Onawo or Ona people, are an indigenous people in the Patagonian region of southern Argentina and Chile, including the Tierra del Fuego islands. They were one of the last native groups in South America to be encountered by migrant Europeans in the late 19th century.

Settlement, gold mining and farming in the region of Tierra del Fuego were followed by the Selk&#x27;nam genocide. In the mid-19th century, there were about 4,000 Selk&#x27;nam; in 1916 Charles W. Furlong estimated there were about 800 Selk&#x27;nam living in Tierra del Fuego; with Walter Gardini stating that by 1919 there were 279, and by 1930 just over 100.

In the 2017 Chilean census 1,144 people declared themselves to be Selk&#x27;nam. However, until 2020, they were considered extinct as a people by the government in Chile, and much of the English language literature.

While the Selk&#x27;nam are closely associated with living in the northeastern area of Tierra del Fuego archipelago, they are believed to have originated as a people on the mainland. Thousands of years ago, they migrated by canoe across the Strait of Magellan. Their territory in the early Holocene probably ranged as far as the Cerro Benítez area of the Cerro Toro mountain range in Chile.

== History ==

Traditionally, the Selk&#x27;nam were nomadic people who relied on hunting for survival, though they were also recorded as engaging in occasional fishing during low tides. They dressed sparingly despite the cold climate of Patagonia. They shared Tierra del Fuego with the Haush (Manek&#x27;enk), another related nomadic culture who lived in the south-eastern part of the island, and the Yahgan (Yámana), an unrelated group who could be found along the southern coast.

=== Relations with Europeans ===
In late 1599, a small Dutch fleet led by Olivier van Noort entered the Strait of Magellan and had a hostile encounter with Selk&#x27;nam which left about forty Selk&#x27;nam dead. It was the bloodiest recorded event in the strait until then.

James Cook described meeting a people in Tierra del Fuego in 1769 that used pieces of glass in their arrowheads. Cook believed the glass had been a gift from the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville, indicating potentially several early contacts. Glass arrowheads became an ever more common occurrence among the Selk&#x27;nam as their interactions with Europeans became more common.

The Selk&#x27;nam had little contact with ethnic Europeans until settlers arrived in the late 19th century. These newcomers developed a great part of the land of Tierra del Fuego as large (ranches), depriving the natives of their ancestral hunting areas. The Selk&#x27;nam, who did not have a concept of private property, considered the sheep herds to be game and hunted the sheep. The ranch owners regarded this as poaching, and paid armed groups or militia to hunt down and kill the Selk&#x27;nam, in what is now called the Selk&#x27;nam genocide.
Salesian missionaries worked to protect and preserve Selk&#x27;nam culture. Father explored the region and studied the native Patagonian cultures and languages between 1881 and 1924. He compiled a 4,000-word vocabulary of the Selk&#x27;nam language, and 1,400 phrases and sentences, which was published in 1915. He included a comparative list of 150 Selk&#x27;nam-Tehuelche words, as he believed that there were connections to the Tehuelche people and language to the north. German anthropologist Robert Lehmann-Nitsche published the first scholarly studies of the Selk&#x27;nam, although he was later criticised for having studied members of the Selk&#x27;nam people who had been abducted and were exhibited in circuses.

A common comment about the Selk&#x27;nam from Europeans was on their height, where in early records they were recorded as &quot;giants&quot;, with the ethnographer Frederick Cook writing in 1897–1899 that their average height was six foot, with instances of individuals six and a half foot tall.

Relations with Europeans in the Beagle Channel area in the southern area of the island of Tierra del Fuego were somewhat more cordial than with the ranchers. Thomas Bridges, who had been an Anglican missionary at Ushuaia, retired from that service. He was given a large land grant by the Argentine government, where he founded Estancia Harberton. Lucas Bridges, one of his three sons, did much to help the local cultures. Like his father, he learned the languages of the various groups and tried to provide the natives with some space in which to live their customary lives as &quot;lords of their own land.&quot; However the forces of change were against the indigenous tribes, who continued to have high fatality rates as their cultures were disrupted. Lucas Bridges&#x27; book, &quot;Uttermost Part of the Earth&quot; (1948), provides sympathetic insight into the lives of the Selk&#x27;nam and Yahgan. In recording the stories of a multitude of Europeans living in Tierra del Fuego, the journalist John Randolph Spears wrote that:
=== Selk&#x27;nam genocide ===

The Selk&#x27;nam genocide was the genocide of the Selk&#x27;nam people from the second half of the 19th to the early 20th century. The genocide spanned a period of between ten and fifteen years. The Selk&#x27;nam had an estimated population of 4,000 people around the 1880s but saw their numbers reduced to 500 by the early 1900s.

In 1879, the presence of significant gold deposits in the sands of the main rivers of Tierra del Fuego were reported. Hundreds of colonialists and foreign newcomers came to the island in search of fortune, conflicting with the indigenous population. However, resources of the metal depleted rapidly.

Ranching became the center of controversy in the Magellanic colony. The colonial authorities were aware of the indigenous group&#x27;s plight, but sided with the ranchers&#x27; cause over the Selk&#x27;nam, who were excluded from their worldview based on &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;civilization.&quot; Ranchers typically exercised their own judgement, including the financing of violent campaigns. Considerable numbers of foreign men were hired, and quantities of arms were imported for these campaigns, with the goal of eliminating the Selk&#x27;nam, who were perceived as a major obstacle to the success of colonists&#x27; investments. Farm employees later confirmed the routine nature of such campaigns.

The shareholders of the Company for the Exploitation of Tierra del Fuego () strove to hide their actions towards native tribes from the public. This was both a means for the company to avoid questioning and a strategy to lower its controversial profile. Special attention was paid to these events after the intervention of the Salesian missionaries, who condemned the actions of the ranchers while themselves unintentionally contributing to the extermination of native cultures.

Beginning in the 1890s, the situation of the Selk&#x27;nam became severe. As the territories of the north began to be largely occupied by farms and ranches, many indigenous people, beset by hunger and persecuted by colonists, started to flee towards the extreme south of the island. This region was already inhabited by indigenous groups who had a strong sense of ownership over the land. Consequently, the fights for control of territory intensified.
The large ranchers tried to drive out the Selk&#x27;nam, then began a campaign of extermination against them, with the complicity of the Argentine and Chilean governments. Large companies paid sheep farmers or militia a bounty for each Selk&#x27;nam dead, which was confirmed by the presentation of a pair of hands or ears or, later, a complete skull. They were given more for the death of a woman than a man. The predicament of the Selk&#x27;nam worsened with the establishment of religious missions, which disrupted their livelihood through forcible relocation, and inadvertently brought with them deadly epidemics.

Repression against the Selk&#x27;nam persisted into the early twentieth century. Chile moved most of the Selk&#x27;nam in their territory to Dawson Island in the mid-1890s, confining them to a Salesian mission. Argentina finally allowed Salesian missionaries to aid the Selk&#x27;nam and attempt to assimilate them, with their traditional culture and livelihoods then completely interrupted.

Later conflicts between governor and the head of the Salesian mission José Fagnano only served to worsen, rather than improve, conditions for the Selk&#x27;nam. Long disputes between civil authorities and priests did not allow a satisfactory solution to the indigenous issue. Governor Señoret favored the ranchers&#x27; cause, and took little interest in the incidents that took place in Tierra del Fuego.
Two Christian missions were established to preach to the Selk&#x27;nam. They were intended to provide housing and food for the natives, but closed due to the small number of Selk&#x27;nam remaining; they had numbered in the thousands before Western colonization, but by the early twentieth century only a few hundred remained.

Alejandro Cañas estimated that in 1896 there was a population of 3,000 Selk&#x27;nam. Martín Gusinde, an Austrian priest and ethnologist who studied them in the early 20th century, wrote in 1919 that only 279 Selk&#x27;nam remained. In 1945 the Salesian missionary, Lorenzo Massa, counted 25. In May 1974, Ángela Loij, the last known Selk&#x27;nam of non-mixed ancestry, died.

=== Current status ===

 was formed in the 1980s to fight for recognition and the rights of Selk&#x27;nam in Argentina, and in 1994 were recognised as an indigenous people by the government. In 1998, the provincial Legislature of Tierra del Fuego recognised a treaty signed in 1925 between the president of Argentina, Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, and the Selk&#x27;nam people. Law 405 restored 35,000 hectares of 45,000 designated in the treaty to the Selk&#x27;nam people, with the remaining 10,000 hectares retained for the future establishment of the municipality of Tolhuin.

The 2010 National Population Census in Argentina revealed the existence of 2,761 people who recognised themselves as Selk&#x27;nam throughout the country, 294 of them in the province of Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica and South Atlantic Islands.

In the 2017 Chilean census 1,144 people declared themselves to be Selk&#x27;nam. The descendants of the previously considered extinct Selk&#x27;nam people are in the process of cultural reappropriation and recreation and do not consider themselves or their people as extinct. The campaigned for an amendment to Indigenous Law 19.253, and on 27 June 2020 the Chamber of Deputies of Chile adjusted the law, recognizing the Selk&#x27;nam as one of the indigenous peoples of Chile. Then on 5 September 2023 the National Congress of Chile recognised the Selk’nam as one of the 11 original peoples of Chile, accepting them as a living community of Chile. Members of parliament issued a statement declaring their regret over the role the Chilean and Argentinean states played in the massacres of Indigenous people.

== Culture and religion ==
The missions and early 20th-century anthropologists collected information about Selk&#x27;nam culture, religion and traditions while trying to help them preserve their culture.

=== Hunting and diet ===
A large part of the traditional diet of Selk&#x27;nam according to early accounts, was made of the guanaco which they hunted using bows and arrows as well as with s. The guanaco of Tierra del Fuego were recorded as being larger than their Patagonian counterparts. The hide of the guanaco hunted by Selk&#x27;nam were then used in the construction of shelters, bags, and clothing. The Selk&#x27;nam were also known to engage in fishing during low tides using spears, where the majority of seafood procured were eels, though more rarely caught seafood such as róbalos were more valued. In the south of the island birds made up a portion of the Selk&#x27;nam diet. Later research has brought the proportionality of food resources in these early accounts into question.

The Selk&#x27;nam were also known to employ the Fuegian dog, a domesticated form of the culpeo, in hunting efforts. While Julius Popper did not observe the dogs being of use in hunts, Antonio Coiazzi did record their use in hunting and this has been supported by later research. All sources agree that the dogs also provided a source of warmth in shelters as they would arrange themselves to sleep tightly against and around the Selk&#x27;nam.

=== Language ===
The Selk&#x27;nam spoke the Ona language of the Chon language family. Missionary José María Beauvoir compiled a dictionary of the Selk&#x27;nam language. One source states that the last fluent native speakers died in the 1980s.

=== Body decoration ===
For special occasions, such as initiation ceremonies, weddings, and funerals, Selk&#x27;nam would decorate their bodies with paint, especially their faces. The main colors employed in decoration are red, black, and white.

=== Religion ===

Selk&#x27;nam religion was a complex system of beliefs, with a creation myth. Temáukel was the name of the great supernatural entity who they believed kept the world order. The creator deity of the world was called Kénos or Quénos.

The Selk&#x27;nam had individuals who took shaman-like roles. Such a &quot;xon&quot; () had supernatural capabilities, e.g. to control weather.

=== Initiation ceremonies ===

The Selk&#x27;nam male initiation ceremony, the passage to adulthood, was called &quot;Hain&quot;. Nearby indigenous peoples, the Yahgan and Haush, had similar initiation ceremonies.

Young males were called to a dark hut. There they would be attacked by &quot;spirits&quot;, who were men dressed as supernatural beings. Children were taught to believe in and fear these spirits during childhood and were threatened by them in case they misbehaved. The boys&#x27; task in this rite of passage was to unmask the spirits; when the boys saw that the spirits were human, they were told a story of world creation related to the sun and moon. In a related story, they were told that in the past women used to be disguised as spirits to control men. When the men discovered the masquerade, they, in turn, would threaten women as spirits. According to the men, the women never learned that the masked men were not truly spirits, but the males found out at the initiation rite.

The contemporary ceremonies used this interplay in somewhat of a joking way. After the first day, related ceremonies and rituals took place. Males showed their strength in front of women by fighting spirits (who were other men but the women supposedly did not know it) in some theatrical fights. Each spirit was played with traditional actions, words and gestures, so that everyone could identify it. The best spirit actors from previous &quot;Hain&quot;s were called again to impersonate spirits in later &quot;Hain&quot;s.

Apart from these dramatic re-enactments of mythic events, the &quot;Hain&quot; involved tests for young males for courage, resourcefulness, resisting temptation, resisting pain and overcoming fear. It also included prolonged instructional courses to train the young men in the tasks for which they would be responsible.

Before European encounter, the various rites of the &quot;Hain&quot; lasted a very long time, perhaps even a year on occasion. It would end with the last fight against the &quot;worst&quot; spirit. Usually &quot;Hain&quot;s were started when there was enough food (for example a whale was washed onto the coast), a time when all the Selk&#x27;nam from all the groups would gather at one place, in male and female camps. &quot;Spirits&quot; sometimes went to female encampments to scare them, as well as moving around and acting in ways that related to their characters.

The last &quot;Hain&quot; was held in one of the missions in the early 20th century, and was photographed by missionary Martin Gusinde. It was a shorter and smaller ceremony than used to be held. The photographs show the &quot;spirit&quot; costumes the Selk&#x27;nam created and wore. Gusinde&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Tribes of Tierra Del Fuego&quot; (2015) was published in English by Thames &amp; Hudson, and in French and Spanish by Éditions Xavier Barral.

=== Marriage and mourning traditions ===
Beyond decorating the faces of the individuals marrying, another tradition observed by Gusinde among the Selk&#x27;nam was related to marriage proposals, where a man would have a bow made and silently present it to the woman he wished to marry in front of the elders of her family.

After the death of an individual, it was the duty of their family to light a large fire and engage in singing and dancing. The individual would then be wrapped in a guanaco cape, and buried as soon as possible. There was also a tradition of specifically burying individuals in the hollows or roots of trees, and making sure the deceased could not be seen once they had been place there. There is no tradition of grave goods.

== Heritage ==
Photographs of Selk&#x27;nam people taken by the missionaries are displayed at the Martin Gusinde Anthropological Museum in Puerto Williams. There are also a few books on the subject, including Selk&#x27;nam tales, collected by the missions, and a dictionary of the Selk&#x27;nam (Ona) language. Due to early contact by missionaries, much more information was collected about the Selk&#x27;nam people than about other people of the region.

Austrian priest and ethnologist Gusinde tried also to collect information about other local people, but he found their numbers much reduced. He was able to write more about traditional Selk&#x27;nam culture because it was still being lived by the Selk&#x27;nam people into the 20th century.

 the ancestral remains of 14 Selk&#x27;nam individuals are kept in the collection of the Natural History Museum Vienna.

== Famous individuals ==

Ángela Loij (1900–1974) is considered to have been the last Selk&#x27;nam of non-mixed ancestry, a school was named in her honour in Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego. Her grand-niece Amalia Gudiño was elected as a deputy in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1995, becoming the first indigenous person to serve as a deputy in Argentina.
 (1913–2004) was an artisanal carver from Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. The daughter of a Selk&#x27;nam mother and a Basque father, she won awards for her artistic works detailing life in Tierra del Fuego.

<text>The Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions (OBESSU) is the umbrella organization of 36 national school student unions from 24 European countries. An interlocutor with the European Commission, European Parliament, Council of Europe and UNESCO, OBESSU is a full member of the Lifelong Learning Platform (LLLP) and the European Youth Forum (YFJ), and an associate member of the European Students&#x27; Union.

==History==
OBESSU was founded in Dublin, Ireland in April 1975 by national student unions from Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland. The initial aim of the organisation was to create a pan-European school student organisation that could be a platform for cooperation between the national school student unions. By 1980 the platform had added members from Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg and West Germany and throughout the next decade expanded its membership across Europe. In 1985 OBESSU declared its support for COSAS (the Congress of the South African Students) in their struggle against the apartheid regime.

In 1987, the first international school student meeting was organised in La Havana where representatives of the OBESSU board and many of OBESSU’s Member Organisations participated. The same year, representatives from the USSR, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and DDR joined an OBESSU conference in Strasbourg with the aim to establish a more stable contact between the national school student unions in Eastern and Western Europe. In 1995 OBESSU launched a project to support the growth of school student unions in central and Eastern Europe. Since the early nineties national organisations have been established in Slovenia, Slovakia, Macedonia, and Hungary.In 1999 OBESSU launched the UNBASCO project which focused on supporting the stabilisation of school student unions in the Baltic countries, leading to the inclusion of student unions from Estonia and Lithuania.

In April 2005, the &quot;30th Anniversaire Celebrations&quot; of the foundation of OBESSU were celebrated in Dublin, Ireland and hosted by the Union of Secondary Students. On 7 December 2011, OBESSU was awarded the 3rd Civil Society Prize during the plenary session of the European Economic and Social Committee for the ‘Light on the Rights’ Bus Tour project. 

==Objectives==
OBESSU works to:
* represent the school students as stakeholders of their educational systems, and in issues concerning their lives;
* provide the national school student unions with assistance and support and to co-operate for the development of school student representative structures;
* encourage and enable exchange of experience and good practice among the national school students unions;
* promote equal access to education and to strive for the end of all discrimination and injustice within the educational systems;
* contribute to the development of democratic educational systems in Europe, that promote active citizenship in all forms;
* promote solidarity and understanding between young people.

==Structure==
A General Assembly (GA) serves as the highest decision-making body. The General Assembly meets annually and have authority over the statutes, the political platform and the workplan, as well as electing the Board of OBESSU, the highest decision making body between the GA and Council of Members. The Board is elected annually with overlapping mandates. In this way not all Board members are elected in the same year. The Board consists of 5 members and is responsible for leading and representing the organisation between the General Assemblies. 

Between every General Assembly there is a Council of Members (COMEM), which is the second highest decision-making body within OBESSU. The Board and the Secretary General coordinate the daily work of the organisation. OBESSU has a European secretariat based in Brussels. The Secretariat functions as the central coordination and information centre within the organisation. A substantial portion of the preparatory work is conducted at the secretariat, alongside ongoing lobbying efforts directed at European institutions. 

==Activities==
OBESSU fights for the interests of all school students in Europe, represents its Member Organisations towards the relevant bodies and institutions, acts as a coordinating body for national and regional school student organisations, unions and structures in Europe, organises activities for its member organisations and initiates a dialogue with and between stakeholders in education

OBESSU organises approximately 10 conferences per year all dealing with education-related topics. OBESSU also works with its ESU counterparts to promote and coordinate the 17th of November as International Students&#x27; Day.

<text>In this List of Perkins engines, &quot;family type&quot; refers to the two letter designation Perkins Engines gives each engine. This nomenclature was introduced in 1978 under Perkins&#x27; new engine numbering scheme, where the family type is encoded in each unique serial number. Engines that went out of production prior to 1978 may have been retroactively assigned a family type to expedite parts support (this is the case with the Perkins 4.107). Some engines never entered production, such as the Perkins 4.224, but were assigned a family type. In the early years, Perkins gave names to their engines, beginning with the smallest Wolf. The larger Lynx and Leopard followed (all four-cylinders), with the 1937 P6 was intended to be called the &quot;Panther.&quot; After a lawsuit from motorcycle manufacturer Phelon &amp; Moore, Perkins dropped the Panther (and Python and Puma for the corresponding P3 and P4 models) and stuck to abbreviations from then on.

Perkins was sold by Massey Ferguson&#x27;s parent Varity Corporation in 1998, and is now a fully owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc.

Houchins of Ashford an MOD contractor would send an MOD inspector to verify dynamometer testing of power and smoke emissions both on start up and full power for one full hour (27 horsepower produced at 3000 rpm) being used near military front lines any excessive smoke whilst running would give the armies position away. When the transport vessel &quot;Atlantic conveyor&quot; was sunk during the Falklands conflict a large quantity of these generating units were lost. The engines were highly stressed due to turbo charging, the 4-107T used a Holset Brand turbocharger without after-cooling, and the longer 4-108 pistons with extended skirts, also a toughened tufftrided crankshaft, larger diameter cylinder head studs were used to contain the high combustion pressures. The engines when rebuilt could take up to four days of diligent running on the &quot;Heenan and Froud&quot; water dynamometer with great care given regarding application and duration of the load as minor tightening was not un-common, and a heavy seizure could result in disassembly and liner and piston replacement. But once run in the process of gaining full power with minimal rpm overshoot or droop or heavy black smoke was achieved by finely adjusting the injection timing and governor load springs in the CAV DPA injection pump.&quot;

<text>Pinus edulis, the Colorado pinyon, two-needle piñon, pinyon pine, or simply piñon, is a pine in the pinyon pine group native to the Southwestern United States, used for its edible pine nuts.

== Description ==
The piñon pine (&quot;Pinus edulis&quot;) is a small to medium size tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to , rarely more. Its growth is &quot;at an almost inconceivably slow rate&quot; growing only 1.8 meters (6 ft) in one hundred years under good conditions. for an average growth of 18 millimeters (0.72 in) per year. The bark is irregularly furrowed and scaly. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in pairs, moderately stout, long, and green, with stomata on both inner and outer surfaces but distinctly more on the inner surface forming a whitish band.

The cones are globose, long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18–20 months old, with only a small number of thick scales, with typically 5–10 fertile scales. The cones open to broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are long, with a thin shell, a white endosperm, and a vestigial wing.

The species intermixes with Pinus monophylla sbsp. fallax (see description under &quot;Pinus monophylla&quot;) for several hundred kilometers along the Mogollon Rim of central Arizona and the Grand Canyon resulting in trees with both single- and two-needled fascicles on each branch. The frequency of two-needled fascicles increases following wet years and decreases following dry years. The internal anatomy of both these needle types are identical except for the number of needles in each fascicle suggesting that Little&#x27;s 1968 designation of this tree as a variety of Pinus edulis is more likely than its subsequent designation as a subspecies of Pinus monophylla based entirely upon its single needle fascicle.

It is an aromatic species. Essential oil can be extracted from the trunk, limbs, needles, and seed cones. Prominent aromatic compounds from each portion of the tree include α-pinene, sabinene, β-pinene, δ-3-carene, β-phellandrene, ethyl octanoate, longifolene, and germacrene D.
== Taxonomy ==
Colorado pinyon was described by George Engelmann in 1848 from collections made near Santa Fe, New Mexico on Alexander William Doniphan&#x27;s expedition to northern Mexico in 1846 and 1847.
It is most closely related to the single-leaf pinyon, which hybridises with it occasionally where their ranges meet in western Arizona and Utah. It is also closely related to the Texas pinyon, but is separated from it by a gap of about so does not hybridise with it.

An isolated population of trees in the New York Mountains of southeast California, previously thought to be Colorado pinyons, have recently been shown to be a two-needled variant of single-leaf pinyon from chemical and genetic evidence. Occasional two-needled pinyons in northern Baja California, Mexico have sometimes been referred to Colorado pinyon in the past, but are now known to be hybrids between single-leaf pinyon and Parry pinyon.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range in the U.S. is in Colorado, southern Wyoming, eastern and central Utah, northern Arizona, New Mexico, western Oklahoma, southeastern California, and the Guadalupe Mountains in far western Texas, as well as northern Mexico. It occurs at moderate elevations of , rarely as low as and as high as . It is widespread and often abundant in this region, forming extensive open woodlands, usually mixed with junipers in the pinyon-juniper woodland plant community. The Colorado pinyon (piñon) grows as the dominant species on 4.8 million acres () in Colorado, making up 22% of the state&#x27;s forests. The Colorado pinyon has cultural meaning to agriculture, as strong piñon wood &quot;plow heads&quot; were used to break soil for crop planting at the state&#x27;s earliest known agricultural settlements.

There is one known example of a Colorado pinyon growing amongst Engelmann spruce (&quot;Picea engelmannii&quot;) and limber pine (&quot;Pinus flexilis&quot;) at nearly on Kendrick Peak in the Kaibab National Forest of northern Arizona.

==Ecology==
The seeds are dispersed by the pinyon jay, which plucks them out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees. The seeds are also eaten by wild turkey, Montezuma quail, and various mammals.

==Uses==
The edible seeds, pine nuts, are extensively collected throughout its range; in many areas, the seed harvest rights are owned by Native American tribes, for whom the species is of immense cultural and economic importance. They can be stored for a year when unshelled.

Archaeologist Harold S. Gladwin described pit-houses constructed by southwestern Native Americans  400–900 CE; these were fortified with posts made from Pinyon trunks and coated with mud.

Colorado pinyon is also occasionally planted as an ornamental tree and sometimes used as a Christmas tree.

== In culture ==
The piñon pine (&quot;Pinus edulis&quot;) is the state tree of New Mexico.

<text>The Weenen massacre () was the massacre of Voortrekkers, Khoikhoi and Basuto by the Zulu Kingdom on 17 February 1838. The massacres occurred at Doringkop, Bloukrans River, Moordspruit, Rensburgspruit and other sites around the present day town of Weenen in South Africa&#x27;s KwaZulu-Natal province.

==Massacre==
After killing Piet Retief and about 100 people of his delegation, the Zulu King Dingane sent his impis to kill the remaining voortrekkers who were camped at Doringkop, Bloukrans (Blaauwekrans), Moordspruit, Rensburgspruit and other sites along the Bushman River (), in the present province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, near the town of Weenen.

&quot;Not a soul was spared. Old men, women and babies were murdered in the most brutal manner.&quot;

===Death toll===
Among the Voortrekkers, 41 men, 56 women and 185 children were killed. In addition another 250 or 252 Khoikhoi and Basuto who accompanied the Voortrekkers were killed, bringing the casualties to 532–534.

The murdered included George Biggar, the son of Alexander Biggar, a trader at Port Natal. Biggar and his second son, Robert, subsequently participated and died in retaliatory attacks on the Zulus. Most people camped at the Klein- and Groot-Moordspruit were murdered. Here a Boer woman, Johanna van der Merwe, sustained 21 assegai wounds but survived. The camps at Rensburgspruit, where Hans van Rensburg and Andries Pretorius were camped, successfully defended themselves. 
Hans van Rensburg&#x27;s party were compelled to leave their wagons and retreat on foot to a hill, Rensburgkoppie, which was protected by a cliff on one side. Here they were cornered by the Zulus, whom they kept at bay with limited ammunition. When their ammunition was almost exhausted a young man, Marthinus Oosthuizen, arrived on horseback. By shouting instructions they informed him where to locate and salvage ammunition from their camp. This Oosthuizen was able to deliver by charging with his horse through the Zulu file, while covered by the defenders of the hill. With the defense strengthened, the Zulus retreated.

Two months afterwards, on 15 April 1838, Andries Pretorius reflected in his journal: &quot;As we were separated from one another, they succeeded in their attack at daybreak at Blaauwekrans, thereby killing 33 men, 75 women and 123 children.&quot; This implies a total of 231 deaths at the Blaauwekrans camps. The name Blaauwekrans () refers to bluish cliff faces present in the area.

==Aftermath==
The Piet Retief Delegation massacre and the Weenen massacre were the motivation for the Voortrekkers to confront the Zulus in battle on 16 December 1838 when 470 Voortrekkers fought against an estimated 15,000 to 21,000 Zulus; which the Voortrekkers won. The battle is known as the Battle of Blood River.

The town of Weenen (Dutch for &quot;crying&quot; or &quot;weeping&quot;) was established two months after the massacre.

<text>A gongoozler is a person who enjoys watching activity on the canals of the United Kingdom. The term is also used more generally to describe those who harbour an interest in canals and canal life, but do not actively participate.

==Etymology==
&quot;Gongoozler&quot; may have been canal workers&#x27; slang for an observer standing apparently idle on the towpath. According to &quot;The Times,&quot; the term has also previously been used to describe &quot;someone who hung around bridges to laugh at the inept efforts of less experienced barge folk as they struggled to pass through locks&quot;. Though it was used derisively in the past, today the term is regularly used, perhaps with a little irony, by barge communities and clubs to describe themselves and their hobby.

Barge communities and clubs have these days adopted the term — in an ironic sense — to describe themselves.

The word may have arisen from words in Lincolnshire dialect: &quot;gawn&quot; and &quot;gooze&quot;, both meaning to stare or gape. It might be presumed that such an expression would date from the nineteenth century, when canals were at their peak, but the word is only recorded from the end of that century or the early twentieth. It was given wider use by L. T. C. Rolt, who used it in his book about canal life, &quot;Narrow Boat&quot;, in 1944. A &quot;gawn&quot; is also a small ship of lading, such as a working-narrowboat.

The term &quot;gongoozler&quot; may also be used in any circumstance in which people are spectating without contributing to either the content or interest of an event. According to the team behind BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;, the word can mean &quot;a person who likes to mindlessly stare (at anything)&quot;.

==Aspects of gongoozling==

Gongoozling, much like trainspotting, is a hobby that can extend to all aspects of canals.

===Canal artwork===
The collection or creation of canal-related artwork is a common pastime amongst gongoozlers. This includes paintings, postcards and photographs.

===Canal locks===
Canal locks often attract spectators, including gongoozlers, because the operation of manual canal locks is a complex affair, with a number of opportunities for mistakes to be made. Some observers have been known to heckle or harass the boat crews, whilst others carry a lock windlass and actively wish to help boat crews with their passage, by opening the paddles, or helping push open the heavy balance beams on the gates.

===Canal history and technology===
Whilst trainspotting is commonly associated with identifying engine makes, it is rare for Gongoozlers to do likewise. However an interest can occur for the history of a section of canal, or the operation of locks and alternative devices such as inclined planes, water slopes, and boat lifts with types like the Anderton boat lift, the Falkirk Wheel and the Strépy-Thieu boat lift.

==Notable locations==
The eight locks of Fonserannes on the Canal du Midi in Southern France attract so many gongoozlers that they have become the third most popular tourist attraction in Languedoc.

In the UK, Foxton Locks (pictured above) in Leicestershire and the Caen Hill flight on the edge of Devizes, Wiltshire are popular locations for gongoozlers to gather.

<text>National Road 38 (, abbreviated as EO38) is a single carriageway road in western and central Greece. It connects Thermo with Lamia, via Agrinio and Karpenisi. It passes through the regional units Aetolia-Acarnania, Evrytania and Phthiotis. 
One section coincides with the European route E952. The E962 goes between Agrinio and Lamia.

==Route==
The western end of the National Road is in the small town Thermo, in Aetolia-Acarnania. It first runs west along the northern shore of Lake Trichonida. It turns north at Agrinio, and continues through the sparsely populated mountains of northeastern Aetolia-Acarnania. The highway crosses the Kremasta reservoir by the Episkopi bridge. It continues east through the mountainous Agrafa area, part of the Pindus mountains. It passes through Karpenisi, the capital town of Evrytania. East of Karpenisi, it passes through a tunnel under the Tymfristos mountain and enters the Spercheios valley. It follows the river Spercheios downstream, through Makrakomi and Leianokladi, and ends in Lamia. The National Road 38 passes through the following places:

*Thermo 
*Paravola
*Agrinio
*Agios Vlasios
*Episkopi

<text>Cypress Falls High School is a secondary school in an unincorporated area of Harris County, Texas, United States. The current principal is Becky Denton. Cypress Falls is part of the Cypress Fairbanks Independent School District, which started during the late 19th century with a school named &quot;The Cypress School&quot;. Originally, there were only 12 schools and it is now one of the largest districts in Houston, Texas.

The school&#x27;s mascot is the golden eagle and their colors are green and gold.

Cypress Falls offers several different extracurricular resources to enhance the student and parent experience. The principal maintains a blog on the high school&#x27;s website to help keep the parents connected and people informed in general.

== History ==

=== Opening of school and National Blue Ribbon ===
The school opened in 1992, becoming the fourth addition to the Cypress Fairbanks ISD high schools. George Hopper opened the school as the first principal on August 24, 1992. Cypress Falls was named a National Blue Ribbon School in 1999-2000.

=== Rezoning ===
Cypress Woods High School relieved Cypress Falls when it opened in fall 2006.

In 2016, as part of high school rezoning, a portion of Cypress Falls&#x27;s attendance zone was reassigned to Cypress Ranch High School and another portion was reassigned to Langham Creek High School.

=== 2016 flood damage and Hurricane Harvey ===
This school and Cy-Fair High School were the two high schools in the district that had the most damage, and more importantly, out of all of the schools in the entire district, Cypress Falls faced the most damage during the April 2016 North American storm complex on April 18, 2016.

Three feet of water was standing in the school auditorium, which resulted to damage and removal of the floor. Two wooden gym floors had to be replaced as well. They also had to cut out some of the drywall and disinfect it.

In August 2017, the first day of school was postponed for students at Cypress Falls due to Hurricane Harvey. The school opened on September 11, 2017.

==Academics==
For the 2018-2019 school year, the school received a B grade from the Texas Education Agency, with an overall score of 87 out of 100. The school received a B grade in each of the three performances domains, with a score of 89 for Student Achievement, 87 for School Progress, and 81 for Closing the Gaps. The school received three of the seven possible distinction designations for Academic Achievement in Mathematics, Academic Achievement in Social Studies, and Top 25%: Comparative Academic Growth.

==Demographics==
The demographic breakdown of the 2,866 students enrolled for 2022-2023 was:
*African American: 20.5%
*Hispanic: 55.8%
*White: 12.6%
*Native American: 0.5%
*Asian: 7.3%
*Pacific Islander: 0.0%
*Two or More Races: 3.3%

64.0% of the students were eligible for free or reduced-cost lunch. For 2022-23, Cypress Falls was a Title I school.

== Feeder patterns ==

Schools that feed into Cypress Falls include:
*Elementary schools: Fiest, Horne, Owens, Birkes (partial), Hairgrove (partial), Lee (partial), Tipps (partial), Lamkin (partial)
*Middle schools: Labay, Truitt (partial), Spillane (partial)

==Extracurricular activities==

During the school year of 2010-2011, Cypress Falls was the only school in its district to have all levels of its music department (band, orchestra, and choir) receive sweepstakes at their UIL Contest.

The Cypress Falls High School varsity men&#x27;s choir performed at the Texas Music Educators Association (TMEA) 2012 Clinic and Convention on Feb. 10 at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio. Selected from hundreds of submissions from across the state, the choir performed a concert before thousands of Texas music educators and students. Additionally, the Cypress Falls High School Varsity Women&#x27;s choir performed at the Texas Music Educators Association (TMEA) 2015 Clinic and Convention at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio in February 2015. Selected from hundreds of submissions from across the state, the choir performed a concert before thousands of Texas music educators and students. In addition to performing at TMEA, the Varsity Women&#x27;s choir also performed at the National American Choral Directors Association (ACDA) 2015 Convention in Salt Lake City in February 2015, as they were selected from thousands of submissions from across the nation. This is the first choir chosen from the Cypress Fairbanks ISD to perform at the national level.

The Cypress Falls Golden Eagle Marching band 2015-2016 is the only Cypress-Fairbanks school to compete and place in finals in the Bands Of America Super Regional in Atlanta Georgia. They currently hold 22 consecutive UIL Sweepstakes and are active participants in the Texas UIL Marching Contest.

<doc id="1247165" wikidata="Q1470699" url="?curid=1247165" title="Weber test">
<text>The Weber test is a screening test for hearing performed with a tuning fork. It can detect unilateral (one-sided) conductive hearing loss (middle ear hearing loss) and unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (inner ear hearing loss). The test is named after Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–1878). Conductive hearing ability is mediated by the middle ear composed of the ossicles: the malleus, the incus, and the stapes. Sensorineural hearing ability is mediated by the inner ear composed of the cochlea with its internal basilar membrane and attached cochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). The outer ear consisting of the pinna, ear canal, and ear drum or tympanic membrane transmits sounds to the middle ear but does not contribute to the conduction or sensorineural hearing ability save for hearing transmissions limited by cerumen impaction (wax collection in the ear canal).

The Weber test has had its value as a screening test questioned in the literature.

==Weber test performance==
The Weber and the Rinne test ( ) are typically performed together when the results of each combined to determine the location and nature of any hearing losses detected. In the Weber test a vibrating tuning fork (Typically 256 Hz or 512 Hz used for Weber vibration test; 512 Hz used for Rinne hearing test) is placed in the middle of the forehead, above the upper lip under the nose over the teeth, or on top of the head equidistant from the patient&#x27;s ears on top of thin skin in contact with the bone. The patient is asked to report in which ear the sound is heard louder. A normal Weber test has a patient reporting the sound heard equally in both sides. In an affected patient, if the defective ear hears the Weber tuning fork louder, the finding indicates a conductive hearing loss in the defective ear. Also in the affected patient, if the normal ear hears the tuning fork sound better, there is sensorineural hearing loss on the other (defective) ear. However, this assumes that it is known which ear is defective and which is normal (e.g. by the patient telling the clinician that they cannot hear as well in one ear as in the other), when the testing is being done to characterize the type, conductive or sensorineural, of hearing loss that is occurring. In the case where the patient is unaware or has acclimated to their hearing loss, the clinician has to use the Rinne test in conjunction with the Weber to characterize and localize any deficits. That is, an abnormal Weber test is only able to tell the clinician that there is a conductive loss in the ear which hears better or that there is a sensorineural loss in the ear which does not hear as well.

For the Rinne test, a vibrating tuning fork (typically 512 Hz) is placed initially on the mastoid process behind each ear until sound is no longer heard. Then, without re-striking the fork, the fork is then quickly placed just outside the ear with the patient asked to report when the sound caused by the vibration is no longer heard. A normal or positive Rinne test is when sound is still heard when the tuning fork is moved to the air near the ear (air conduction or AC), indicating that AC is equal or greater than bone conduction (or BC). Therefore, AC &gt; BC; which is how it is reported clinically for a normal or positive Rinne result. In conductive hearing loss, bone conduction is better than air or BC &gt; AC, a negative Rinne, if the patient reports that they do not hear the fork once it is moved. The Rinne test is not ideal for distinguishing sensorineural hearing loss, as both sensorineural hearing loss and normal hearing report a positive Rinne test (though the sensorineural patient will have a decreased duration of hearing sound once the fork is moved to air).

In a normal patient, the Weber tuning fork sound is heard equally loudly in both ears, with no one ear hearing the sound louder than the other (lateralization). Similarly, a patient with symmetrical hearing loss will hear the Weber tuning fork sound equally well, with diagnostic utility only in asymmetric (one-sided) hearing losses. In a patient with hearing loss, the Weber tuning fork sound is heard louder in one ear (lateralization) than the other. This clinical finding should be confirmed by repeating the procedure and having the patient occlude one ear with a finger; the sound should be heard best in the occluded ear.

The results of both tests are noted and compared accordingly below to localize and characterize the nature of any detected hearing losses. Note: the Weber and Rinne are screening tests that are not replacements for formal audiometry hearing tests. Reported test accuracy measurements are very variable for clinical screening, surgical candidacy assessments, and estimation of hearing loss severity.

==Detection of air conductive hearing loss==
A patient with a unilateral conductive hearing loss would hear the tuning fork loudest in the affected ear. This is because the ear with the conductive hearing loss is only receiving input from the bone conduction and no air conduction, and the sound is perceived as louder in that ear. This finding is due to the conduction problem of the middle ear (incus, malleus, stapes, and external auditory meatus) which masks the ambient noise of the room, while the well-functioning inner ear (cochlea with its basilar membrane) picks the sound up via the bones of the skull, causing it to be perceived as a louder sound in the affected ear. Another theory, however, is based on the occlusion effect described by Tonndorf et al, in 1966. Lower frequency sounds (as made by the 256 Hz fork) that are transferred through the bone to the ear canal escape from the canal. If an occlusion is present, the sound cannot escape and appears louder on the ear with the conductive hearing loss.

Conductive hearing loss can be mimicked by plugging one ear with a finger and performing the Rinne and Weber tests, which will help clarify the above. Humming a constant note and then plugging one ear is a good way to mimic the findings of the Weber test in conductive hearing loss. The simulation of the Weber test is the basis for the Bing test.

==Detection of sensorineural hearing loss==
If air conduction is intact on both sides (therefore no CHL), the patient will report a quieter sound in the ear with the sensorineuronal hearing loss. This is because the ear with the sensorineuronal hearing loss is not converting input from either the air or bone conduction, and the sound is perceived as louder in the normal ear.

==Considerations and limitations==
This Weber test is most useful in individuals with hearing that is different between the two ears. It cannot confirm normal hearing because it does not measure sound sensitivity in a quantitative manner. Hearing defects affecting both ears equally, as in presbycusis will produce an apparently normal test result.

Weber test considerations
The Weber test reflects &quot;conduction loss&quot; in the ipsilateral ear because, in the event of impaired conduction, ipsilateral sensorineural hearing is perceived as louder; this is the same reason humming becomes more salient when covering the ears. If the Weber-lateralized ear has a positive Rinne test (AC&gt;BC), that generally means the absence of conduction loss in that ear, and the reason sound had been perceived as louder on that side is because a sensorineural loss is present contralaterally; an ipsilateral negative Rinne test (BC&gt;AC), on the other hand, would confirm ipsilateral conductive hearing loss (although contralateral sensorineural hearing loss may &quot;still&quot; be present. If the Weber-lateralized ear has a positive Rinne test and the contralateral ear has a negative Rinne test, then both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss are present in the contralateral ear. This is because sensorineural deficits always take auditory precedence over conductive ones, so even though conductive hearing loss is present in the contralateral ear, it is the sensorineural deficit that is responsible for the ipsilateral perceived elevation of volume. This also means that a Weber-lateralized ear with bilateral negative-Rinne corresponds to only sensorineural hearing on the ipsilateral side &quot;not&quot; being affected.

Rinne test considerations
Although there is no replacement for formal audiometry, a quick screening test can be made by complementing the Weber test with the Rinne test.

The Rinne test is used in cases of unilateral hearing loss and establishes which ear has the greater bone conduction. Combined with the patient&#x27;s perceived hearing loss, it can be determined if the cause is sensorineural or conductive. For example, if the Rinne test shows that air conduction (AC) is greater than bone conduction (BC) in both ears and the Weber test lateralizes to a particular ear, then there is sensorineural hearing loss in the opposite (weaker) ear. Conductive hearing loss is confirmed in the weaker ear if bone conduction is greater than air conduction and the Weber test lateralizes to that side. Combined hearing loss is likely if the Weber test lateralizes to the stronger ear and bone conduction is greater than air conduction in the weaker ear.

<doc id="1247167" wikidata="Q2748998" url="?curid=1247167" title="Game Over (video game)">
<text>Game Over is an action video game developed by Dinamic Software and published by Imagine Software in 1987. It was released for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, Thomson TO7, and ZX Spectrum. The game includes some adventure game elements. A prompted unrated sequel, &quot;Game Over II&quot;, was released in 1987.

==Plot==

Arkos, a former loyal lieutenant of the beautiful but evil galactic empress Queen Gremla, became a rebel dedicated to end her cruel tyranny. The first part of the game takes place on the prison planet Hypsis, from which Arkos must try to escape. In the second part, Arkos arrives in the jungle swamp planet Sckunn to infiltrate the queen&#x27;s palace, defeat her Giant Guardian robot, and assassinate her.

==Reception==

Controversy arose around the presence of a visible nipple on the advertising and inlay artwork, which had originally appeared on the cover of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (May 1984 - Vol. 8, No. 2) called &quot;Cover Ere Comprimee&quot; and is attributed to Luis Royo. Oliver Frey, the art editor for &quot;Crash&quot; magazine, added a metal corset covering the exposed area so that it could be printed in their magazine. In the end retailers demanded that a logo be placed over the original artwork&#x27;s nipple. &quot;Game Over&quot; won the awards for best advert and best inlay of the year, according to the readers of &quot;Crash&quot;.

The game itself was mostly well received. &quot;Computer &amp; Video Games&quot; awarded it 8/10 for the ZX Spectrum and 7/10 for the Amstrad CPC versions. The MSX version was rated an overall 8/10 by &quot;MSX Extra&quot;, and the Commodore 64 version was given a score of 68% by &quot;Zzap!64&quot;. &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; rated the ZX Spectrum version 9/10, but the 1990 re-release edition from Alternative Software, which featured a sanitised version of the original cover described as &quot;tragically modified&quot;, was given only 52% for its high difficulty level.

==Legacy==
&quot;Game Over&quot; was followed by &quot;Game Over II&quot; (also known as &quot;Phantis&quot; in its native Spain), which was developed and published by Dinamic Software in 1987.

<doc id="1247169" wikidata="Q332049" url="?curid=1247169" title="Manco Inca Yupanqui">
<text>Manqu Inka Yupanki (Quechua) (around 15151544) (Manco Inca Yupanqui in Spanish) was the founder and monarch (Sapa Inca) of the independent Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba, although he was originally a puppet Inca Emperor installed by the Spaniards. He was also known as &quot;Manco II&quot; and &quot;Manco Cápac II&quot;. He was one of the sons of Huayna Capac and a younger brother of Huascar.

==Biography==
===Origin and enthronement===
Manco Inca, one of the more than 50 sons of Huayna Capac, was born in Cuzco. When Atahualpa&#x27;s troops took the city under the command of General Quizquiz, they killed the descendants of Huayna Capac, the Huascar supporters, and anyone who could try to take the place of the Inca. Because of this, Manco Inca was forced to flee, avoiding any contact with the atahualpists.

On 14 November 1533, he met the conquistador Francisco Pizarro and his contingent, both Inca and Spanish. This and other events such as the massacre of Atahualpa led Manco Inca to believe that the Spaniards were &quot;saviors&quot; sent by the gods.

Túpac Huallpa was a puppet ruler crowned by Francisco Pizarro. After his death, Manco Inca joined Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro in Cajamarca. When Pizarro&#x27;s forces arrived in Cusco, he had the &quot;caciques&quot; acknowledge Manco as their Inca. Manco Inca then joined Almagro and Hernando de Soto in pursuit of Quizquiz.

When Pizarro left Cuzco with Almagro and Manco Inca, for Jauja in pursuit of Quizquiz, Francisco left his younger brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Juan Pizarro as regidores, and a ninety-man garrison in the city.

The Pizarro brothers so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately tried to escape in 1535. He failed, was captured and imprisoned. Hernando Pizarro released him to recover a golden statue of his father Huayna Capac. Only accompanied by two Spaniards, he easily escaped a second time. Manco then gathered an army of 200,000 Inca warriors and laid siege to Cusco in early 1536, taking advantage of Diego de Almagro&#x27;s absence.

After ten months (see the siege of Cuzco), Manco retreated to the nearby fortress of Ollantaytambo in 1537. Here Manco successfully defended attacks by the Spaniards in the January 1537 battle of Ollantaytambo.

Manco coordinated his siege of Cusco with one on Lima, led by one of his captains, Quiso Yupanqui. The Incas were able to defeat four relief expeditions sent by Francisco Pizarro from Lima. This resulted in the death of nearly 500 Spanish soldiers. Some Spaniards were captured and sent to Ollantaytambo.

Alonso de Alvarado was sent by Pizarro to Cusco, but upon his arrival at Abancay, he and his army were captured by Rodrigo Orgóñez in the Battle of Abancay. This was the beginning of the first civil war between the conquistadors.

Abandoning Ollantaytambo (and effectively giving up the highlands of the empire), Manco Inca retreated to Vitcos and finally to the remote jungles of Vilcabamba, where he founded the Neo-Inca State which lasted until the death of Túpac Amaru in 1572. From there, he continued his attacks against the Wankas (one of the most important allies of the Spaniards), having some success after fierce battles, and to the highlands of present-day Bolivia, where after many battles his army was defeated.

The Spaniards crowned his younger half brother Paullu Inca as puppet Sapa Inca after his retreat for his valuable help in that last campaign. The Spanish succeeded in capturing Manco&#x27;s sister-wife, Cura Ocllo, who was raped by Gonzalo Pizarro and kept by him at Pizzaro&#x27;s Palace in Casana; the Spaniards had her brutally murdered in 1539.

===Death===
After many guerrilla battles in the mountainous regions of Vilcabamba, Manco was murdered in 1544 in the Inca center of Vitcos by supporters of Diego de Almagro who had previously assassinated Francisco Pizarro and who were in hiding under Manco&#x27;s protection. They in turn were all killed by Manco&#x27;s soldiers.

Manco was succeeded by his son Sayri Tupaq. Manco Inca had several sons, including Sayri Tupaq, Titu Cusi, and Túpac Amaru.

<doc id="1247170" wikidata="Q1759298" url="?curid=1247170" title="Rinne test">
<text>The Rinne test ( ) is used primarily to evaluate loss of hearing in one ear. It compares perception of sounds transmitted by air conduction to those transmitted by bone conduction through the mastoid. Thus, one can quickly screen for the presence of conductive hearing loss.

A Rinne test should always be accompanied by a Weber test to also detect sensorineural hearing loss and thus confirm the nature of hearing loss.

The Rinne test was named after German otologist Heinrich Adolf Rinne (1819–1868); the Weber test was named after Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–1878).

==Procedure==

The Rinne test is performed by placing a 512 Hz vibrating tuning fork against the patient&#x27;s mastoid bone and asking the patient to tell you when the sound is no longer heard. Once the patient signals they can&#x27;t hear it, the still vibrating tuning fork is then placed 1–2 cm from the auditory canal. The patient is then asked again to indicate when they are no longer able to hear the tuning fork.

==Results==
===Normal hearing===
* Air conduction should be greater than bone conduction, so the patient should be able to hear the tuning fork next to the pinna (outer ear) after they can no longer hear it when held against the mastoid. This normal result is paradoxically called a &quot;positive&quot; Rinne test (as a positive medical test usually indicates an abnormality).

===Abnormal hearing===
* If the patient is not able to hear the tuning fork after it is moved from the mastoid to the pinna, it means that their bone conduction is greater than their air conduction. This indicates there is something inhibiting the passage of sound waves from the ear canal, through the middle ear apparatus and into the cochlea (i.e., there is a conductive hearing loss). 
* In sensorineural hearing loss the ability to sense the tuning fork by both bone and air conduction is equally diminished, implying they will hear the tuning fork by air conduction after they can no longer hear it through bone conduction. This pattern is the same to what is found in people with normal hearing, but patients with sensorineural hearing loss will indicate that the sound has stopped much earlier. This can be revealed by the person administering the test (with normal hearing) placing the fork close to their own ear after the patient indicates that the sound has subsided, noting that the sound from the fork is still noticeable to a normal ear.
* In case of a severe sensorineural hearing loss caused due to a dead labyrinth, a false negative Rinne test may occur. It is caused by the fact that even though one ear is unable to respond to the test, the other ear can still be stimulated by the bone conduction test (via conducting sound through skull bones to the opposite ear), causing the patient to respond to the tuning fork on mastoid but not when it&#x27;s placed near the affected ear&#x27;s air canal.

==Air vs. bone conductive hearing loss==

Air conduction uses the apparatus of the middle ear (pinna, eardrum and ossicles) to amplify and direct the sound to the cochlea, whereas bone conduction bypasses some or all of these and allows the sound to be transmitted directly to the inner ear albeit at a reduced volume, or via the bones of the skull to the opposite ear.

Note that the words positive and negative are used in a somewhat confusing fashion here, as compared to their typical use in medical tests. Positive or negative in this case means that a certain parameter that was evaluated was present or not. In this case, that parameter is whether air conduction is better than bone conduction. Thus, a &quot;positive&quot; result indicates the healthy state, in contrast to many other medical tests. Therefore, some prefer to avoid using the terms &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot;, and simply state if the test was normal or abnormal. For example: &quot;Rinne&#x27;s test was abnormal in the right ear, with bone conduction greater than air conduction&quot;.

==Limitations==
This test and its complement, the Weber test, are quick screening tests and are not a replacement for formal audiometry. Recently, its value as a screening test has been questioned.

The Rinne test is not reliable in distinguishing sensorineural and conductive loss cases of severe unilateral or total sensorineural loss. In such cases, bone conduction to the contralateral normal ear will be better than air conduction, resulting in a false negative. In such a case, the Weber test will, however, show signs of lateralization, implying some kind of pathology. Formal audiometry testing would be required if any abnormal result is presented.

<doc id="1247171" wikidata="Q7722719" url="?curid=1247171" title="The Christian Harmony">
<text>The Christian Harmony is a shape note hymn and tune book compiled by William Walker. The book was released in 1866 (1867 according to some sources). It is part of the larger tradition of shape note singing.

==Origin==

William Walker was born in 1809 in South Carolina, and grew up near Spartanburg. He became a Baptist song leader and shape note &quot;singing master.&quot; Walker and Benjamin Franklin White, publisher of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;, married sisters. In 1835, Walker published a tunebook entitled &quot;The Southern Harmony&quot; in four-shape (fasola) notation. He incorporated over half of the contents of this &quot;Southern Harmony&quot; into his &quot;Christian Harmony&quot; in 1866. For &quot;The Christian Harmony&quot;, Walker changed from the four-shape system to a seven-shape (doremi) system. Retaining the original four shapes of the Southern Harmony, he devised three other shapes of his own. In defending his change from the four-shape system which he had previously championed, Walker explained that parents wouldn&#x27;t name seven children with only four names. A second edition was released in 1873. William Walker died on September 24, 1875.

==Later editions==
Before the publication of a combined new edition of &quot;The Christian Harmony&quot; in 2010, two editions were in use - the &quot;Carolina book&quot; or &quot;Walker book,&quot; and the &quot;Alabama book&quot; or &quot;Deason book.&quot;

===Carolina book===
The books used in western North Carolina and adjacent areas were 1979, 1994, and 2002 reprints of Walker&#x27;s 1873 edition of the Christian Harmony. None of the old songs were changed in the new reprint; four songs and some commentary were added.

===Alabama book===
The &quot;Alabama&quot; edition was a revision carried out under the leadership of O. A. Parris and John H. Deason and published in 1958. This edition utilized Jesse B. Aikin&#x27;s seven-shape system; this change was made because Aikin&#x27;s system was the most common among gospel singers in the South. In addition to changing to the Aikin notation, the 1958 revision deleted some songs and added new ones:
We have removed from the old book 179 songs. These will found to be the songs very rarely if ever used. We have changed numbers on but 34 songs and in all cases this was not easily avoidable. On 37 of these songs we have given them more room in order that they may be more easily read. We have included 102 songs both old and new that we feel will help very much to make a better and more useful book. (Preface to 1958 edition)
It was used mainly in Alabama and Mississippi. Revisions of the &quot;Alabama&quot; book were released in 1994, with a few song changes and corrections, and again in 2002.

===Combined 2010 edition===

The 2010 edition contains 672 songs. The book is newly typeset and uses the Aikin seven-shape system.

Pages 1–381 largely reproduce the contents and pagination of the 1958 Alabama book. Pages 397–541t contain songs present in the Carolina book but omitted by the 1958 revisers, in order (approximately 200 songs). (Pages 388, 393b, and 545b also contain music from the Carolina book, out of order.) Pages 382, 384–385, 543–545t, 546–548, and 549b (the final song in the book) contain new music not included in the Carolina book or in the 1958 Alabama book. The remaining twelve and a half pages consist of songs from the 1958 Alabama book that have been moved for a more spacious layout.

==Singing communities and traditions==
In 1933, George Pullen Jackson reported on &quot;Christian Harmony&quot; singings in four states: South Carolina (in and around Spartanburg and in York, Union, and Greenville counties), North Carolina (Rutherford and Buncombe counties), southern Missouri (a tradition of singings stretching back to 1889), and Alabama (56 singings in 1932 in &quot;nine mid-state counties&quot;). The publisher, the E.W. Miller Company of Philadelphia, reported sales largely limited to the Spartanburg area at that time.

Online minutes record 43 singings from &quot;The Christian Harmony&quot; in 2010 (12 in North Carolina, nine in Alabama, six in Georgia, six in Virginia, five in South Carolina, three in Tennessee, one in Mississippi, and one in Texas) and 23 singings in 2011 (11 in North Carolina, three in South Carolina, three in Tennessee, three in Georgia, two in Alabama, and one in Arkansas). Camp DoReMi, a summer singing school in Little Switzerland, North Carolina, is held annually and uses both &quot;The Christian Harmony&quot; and the &quot;New Harp of Columbia&quot;.

The Newton County, Mississippi, Christian Harmony Convention was organized in 1875 and is believed to be the oldest continuing Christian Harmony convention. This singing has evolved or preserved some distinctive traditional features, such as a sustained ringing style of singing, and the use of &quot;The Drone&quot; as a closing song.

A singing tradition with deep roots continues in Haywood and Transylvania counties, North Carolina. Old Folks Day in Canton has featured singing from the &quot;Christian Harmony&quot; since the nineteenth century, at the Morning Star Methodist Church, and before that at the Locust Field Church (now the First Baptist Church). The twice-yearly Etowah singing, now held in Horseshoe, N.C., has been held since 1909.

On Sunday 27 October 2013 the first Christian Harmony All-Day Singing in Europe took place at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Primrose Hill, hosted by the Sacred Harp Singers of London, who now regularly sing from the 2010 edition of Walker&#x27;s Christian Harmony. In attendance were Sacred Harp singers from the UK &amp; Ireland, Europe, and the US. The event is scheduled to take place that same Sunday in October 2014 at the same venue.

<text>Alma Gluck (May 11, 1884October 27, 1938) was a Romanian-born American lyric soprano.

==Biography==
Gluck was born as Reba Feinsohn to a Jewish family in Iași, Romania, the daughter of Zara and Leon Feinsohn. Gluck moved to the United States at a young age in 1889. Although her initial success came at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, Gluck later performed widely in America and became an early recording artist. Although various sources claim that her recording of &quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny&quot; for the Victor Talking Machine Co. was the first celebrity recording by a classical musician to sell one million copies, Victor ledgers do not support the claim—nor did Gluck ever make such a claim herself. It was awarded a gold disc, only the seventh to be granted at that time. Gluck was a founder of the American Woman&#x27;s Association.

Her daughter Marcia Davenport was the child of her first marriage (to Bernard Glick, an insurance man). Gluck later married violinist Efrem Zimbalist and had two children, the actor Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. (1918–2014) and Maria Virginia Zimbalist (1915–1981). Gluck evidently adopted her professional surname as a variation of her first husband&#x27;s surname (&quot;Glick&quot;).

Gluck retired to New Hartford, Connecticut, to raise her family in 1925. Although by background an assimilated and nonpracticing Jew who continued to consider herself ethnically Jewish, she found herself attracted, along with her husband Efrem, to Anglican Christianity, and they regularly attended the Episcopal Church in New Hartford. Efrem Jr. and Maria were both christened there, and the couple placed Efrem in an Episcopal boarding school in New Hampshire. Efrem Jr. later became active in evangelical circles and was one of the founders of Trinity Broadcasting Network. Gluck recorded several Christian hymns in duet with Louise Homer, among them &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

After a long illness, she was taken to the Rockefeller Institute Hospital in Manhattan, New York City, but died from liver failure several days later, on October 27, 1938, at the age of 54.

==Legacy==
Gluck is the grandmother to actress Stephanie Zimbalist, the daughter of her son the actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr.

<text>The white tern or common white tern (Gygis alba) is a small seabird found across the tropical oceans of the world. It is sometimes known as the fairy tern, although this name is potentially confusing as it is also the common name of &quot;Sternula nereis&quot;. Other names for the species include angel tern and white noddy in English, and manu-o-Kū in Hawaiian. In the Cook Islands, it is known as the kakaia.

==Taxonomy==
The white tern was first formally described by the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman in 1786 under the binomial name &quot;Sterna alba&quot;. The genus &quot;Gygis&quot; was introduced by the German zoologist Johann Georg Wagler in 1832. The name &quot;Gygis&quot; is from the Ancient Greek for a mythical bird and the specific is Latin for &quot;white&quot;.

Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the white tern is more closely related to the noddies (&quot;Anous&quot;) than it is to the other terns. This implies that &quot;white noddy&quot; would be a more appropriate English name; this has been taken up by at least one major text.

The white tern has four accepted subspecies:
*&quot;G. a. alba&quot; (Sparrman, 1786) — islands of the south tropical Atlantic Ocean including Fernando de Noronha, Trindade, Martin Vas Rocks, Ascension and Saint Helena islands. Larger, 25–30 cm; bill slender, slightly downcurved, all-black; legs dark grey.
*&quot;G. a. candida&quot; (J. F. Gmelin, 1789) — Indian Ocean islands (Seychelles, Mascarene Islands, and southern Maldives) east to the central Pacific Ocean but excluding range of &quot;G. a. leucopes&quot; and &quot;G. a. microrhyncha&quot; in the more southeastern parts of the central Pacific. Larger, 25–30 cm; bill stout, black with a dark blue-grey base, and slightly uptilted at the gonydeal angle; legs dark grey.
*&quot;G. a. leucopes&quot; Holyoak &amp; Thibault, 1976 — Henderson and Pitcairn Islands. Similar to &quot;G. a. candida&quot; but with pale grey legs.
*&quot;G. a. microrhyncha&quot; H. Saunders, 1876 (Little white tern) — Line Islands, Marquesas Islands, Phoenix Islands and Kiribati. Smaller, 23–25 cm, with a slender black bill slightly uptilted at the gonydeal angle; legs pale grey to pinkish.

The little white tern, usually considered a subspecies &quot;G. a. microrhyncha&quot; of the white tern, is treated as a separate species &quot;Gygis microrhyncha&quot; by some authors, but not by either the IOC World Bird List or the Clements Checklist of Birds of the World.

One study has gone further and suggested that there may be three species of &quot;Gygis&quot;, with &quot;Gygis alba&quot; in the Atlantic Ocean, &quot;Gygis candida&quot; in the Indian and western to central Pacific Oceans, and &quot;Gygis microrhyncha&quot; in the southeast-central Pacific. This study also proposed that &quot;G. candida&quot; is gradually extending its range southeastwards, and may in the future result in the extinction of &quot;G. microrhyncha&quot; by replacing it.

==Description==
The white tern is long with a wingspan of . It has pure white plumage, except for a dark streak along the shafts of the outer primary feathers in &quot;G. a. candida&quot;), a black eye accentuated by a narrow ring of black feathers round the eye, and a long black to bluish-black bill. The tail is shallowly forked, but like in the noddies, with the longest feathers the second-from outermost, not the outermost as in other terns. The legs are dark grey, to paler grey in &quot;G. a. leucopes&quot; and &quot;G. a. microrhyncha&quot;. The juvenile is white mottled with grey or greyish-brown. Nesting on coral islands, usually on trees with small branches but also on rocky ledges and on man-made structures, the white tern feeds on small fish which it catches by plunge diving.

==Distribution and habitat==
The white tern ranges widely across tropical regions of South Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean from the coasts of Chile and Colombia to New Zealand and along the eastern and southern coasts of Asia from China to India, South Maldives, the islands of the Indian Ocean, and the coast of South Africa. Occasional vagrants have been found in Japan, Madagascar, Mexico, and on some islands north of the Equator in the Atlantic Ocean. It is a pelagic and epipelagic bird, living along the coast and moving into wooded areas during the breeding season.

==Behaviour==
This species is notable for laying its egg on bare thin branches in a small fork or depression without a nest. This behaviour is unusual for terns, which generally nest on the ground, and even the related tree-nesting black noddy constructs a nest. It is thought that the reason for the absence of nests is the reduction in nest parasites, which in some colonial seabirds can cause the abandonment of an entire colony. In spite of these benefits there are costs associated with tree nesting, as the eggs and chicks are vulnerable to becoming dislodged by heavy winds. For this reason the white tern is also quick to relay should it lose the egg. The newly hatched chicks have well-developed feet with which to hang on to their precarious nesting site. It is a long-lived bird, having been recorded living for 42 years.

==Predators==
Giant tortoises have been observed to hunt the bird on Fregate Island in the Seychelles.

==Relationship with humans==
The white tern, &quot;manu-o-Kū&quot;, was named Honolulu, Hawaii&#x27;s official bird on April 2, 2007.

New Zealand&#x27;s Department of Conservation classifies the white tern as Nationally Critical, with populations having been largely decimated by the introduction of feral cats and rats on Raoul Island, the terns&#x27; only breeding site in the country. As of 2016, the white tern population in New Zealand was reported to be increasing following the eradication of introduced predators in 2002. Globally, the white tern has a large range that is home to several large colonies, and both recognised species are listed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.

<doc id="1247185" wikidata="Q725808" url="?curid=1247185" title="Dick Lips">
<text>&quot;Dick Lips&quot; is a song by American rock band Blink-182, released on February 28, 1998, as the third single from the group&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; (1997). The song was released by Grilled Cheese, a subsidiary label of Cargo Music. It was the band&#x27;s final single with Cargo; &quot;Josie&quot; was distributed jointly through MCA before they left the label by the end of the year.

== Background==
&quot;Dick Lips&quot; was written about an experience in Tom DeLonge&#x27;s high school years, in which he got kicked out of Poway High School during his junior year (1991) after being caught inebriated at a school basketball game. He then attended Rancho Bernardo High School for the remainder of his high school years. &quot;Being kicked out of school was bad, but it was also the best thing in my life. Because none of us would be here today,&quot; DeLonge said in 2001. &quot;Blink-182 is one million percent around today because I got kicked out of school.” The title has no real significance; it was an insult bandied around the Big Fish Studios while recording, that the band wanted to record &quot;for posterity.&quot;

The song largely &quot;failed to register&quot; on international charts, in part due to the continued success of lead single &quot;Dammit&quot;.

==Composition==
The song is composed in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time with a moderately fast tempo of 124 beats per minute. DeLonge&#x27;s vocal range spans from E4 to E5.

==Reception==
Consequence of Sound, in a 2015 top 10 of the band&#x27;s best songs, ranked it as number seven, commenting, &quot;Without delving into unnecessary details, the lyrics hint at an abusive household and a prospect of romantic longing that serves no purpose beyond the promise of &#x27;something new.&#x27; Blink often suffered from spelling out its themes, but &#x27;Dick Lips&#x27; represents one of those rare times they simply let the song speak for itself.&quot;

<text>Tony Lee Cloninger (August 13, 1940 – July 24, 2018) was an American professional baseball player and coach. He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from through for the Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds and the St. Louis Cardinals.

==Playing career==
A power pitcher, Cloninger compiled a career 113–97 record with 1,120 strikeouts and a 4.07 ERA in 1,767 innings pitched. He enjoyed his best year for the 1965 Braves, with career highs in wins (24), strikeouts (211), ERA (3.29), complete games (16), innings (279) and games started (40).

Regarded as a tough fireball pitcher, Cloninger also was an occasional power hitter. He compiled a career batting average of .192, with 67 RBIs and 11 home runs, including five in the 1966 season.

On July 3, 1966, in the Braves&#x27; 17–3 win over the Giants at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, Cloninger helped his team&#x27;s cause with two grand slams and nine RBIs, both of which still stand as Braves franchise single-game bests. Cloninger became the first player in the National League, and remains the only pitcher, to hit two grand slams in the same game. Cloninger used a bat of teammate Denis Menke to hit both home runs, and they stood as the only two grand slams of his major league career.

Cloninger finished his career pitching with Cincinnati and St. Louis. He was acquired along with Clay Carroll and Woody Woodward by the Reds from the Atlanta Braves for Milt Pappas, Bob Johnson and Ted Davidson on June 11, 1968.

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Cloninger served as a bullpen coach for the New York Yankees (1992–2001), where he was a member of five American League champions and four World Series champion teams.

In 2002, he became the pitching coach for the Boston Red Sox, but was forced to step down in early 2003 when he underwent successful treatment for bladder cancer that had been diagnosed in spring training. In 2004, Cloninger became a player development consultant for the Red Sox, serving for almost 15 consecutive seasons until his death.

As Red Sox pitching coach, Cloninger was ejected from a game in 2002 against the Baltimore Orioles. After two batters were hit by pitches, fights broke out and benches cleared. At one point, Cloninger, age 61 at the time but not shying away from trouble, grabbed Orioles player Brook Fordyce in a headlock.

==Death==
Cloninger died on July 24, 2018, in Denver, North Carolina at the age of 77.

<doc id="1247199" wikidata="Q7651427" url="?curid=1247199" title="Suzy Kolber">
<text>Suzy Kolber (; born ) is an American football sideline reporter, co-producer, and a former ESPN sports anchor and reporter. She was one of the original anchors of ESPN2 when it launched in 1993. Three years later, she left ESPN2 to join Fox Sports, but returned to ESPN in late 1999. In 2023, she and several other ESPN employees were terminated by the network in what was described as a cost-cutting measure.

== Early life and education ==
Kolber was born and raised in a Jewish family in the Dresher community of Upper Dublin Township, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Upper Dublin High School in 1982. 

Kolber graduated from the University of Miami in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in telecommunications.

While an undergraduate, she worked at Dynamic Cable in Coral Gables, Florida, where she was a sports director from 1984 to 1986, and was on the University of Miami water ski team.

==Career==
===CBS Sports===
After graduation, she worked at CBS Sports in New York City as a videotape coordinator in 1986.

===WTVJ and WPEC===
From 1985 to 1989, Kolber produced the 5:30 p.m. sportscast at WTVJ-TV in Miami, winning a local Sports Emmy in 1988.

From 1989 to 1990, she freelanced as a specials producer for WPLG-TV in Miami. In addition, she produced two magazine shows, &quot;Greyhound Racing America&quot; in Miami, Florida (1988–90) and &quot;Cowboys Special Edition&quot; in Irving, Texas (1990–91).

In 1991, Kolber&#x27;s freelance assignments included work as a reporter/producer for Breeders&#x27; Cup Newsfeed in Greenwich, Connecticut; a field producer for &quot;Inside Edition&quot; in New York City; a sports specials producer for WCIX-TV in Miami, and a producer/director for NFL Films.

She was a weekend sports anchor and weekday feature reporter at WPEC-TV in West Palm Beach, Florida from December 1991 until she moved to ESPN in 1993.

===ESPN===
Kolber previously covered a variety of assignments for ESPN from the National Football League to the 1996 ESPN X Games bicycle-stunt events and Grand Slam tennis events. She was a sideline reporter on ESPN’s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; with Michele Tafoya.

In 2007, she hosted ESPN’s pre-race &quot;NASCAR Countdown&quot; program.

Kolber joined ESPN’s &quot;MNF&quot; team during its inaugural year in 2006 after five previous seasons on &quot;ESPN&#x27;s Sunday Night Football&quot; (2001–05). As a member of the &quot;MNF&quot; team, Kolber helped the longtime franchise become the most-watched program in cable television history.

Kolber worked the ABC Sports broadcast of Super Bowl XL in Detroit in 2006 with Michele Tafoya and contributed to the network’s pre-game show. She became the first female recipient of the Maxwell Club Sports Broadcaster of the Year Award in 2006 and was named to Sports &quot;Business Daily&quot;s 2004 list of the 10 favorite sports TV personalities of the past 10 years.
Kolber hosted ESPN’s year-round &quot;NFL Live&quot; news and information show, and she played a role in ESPN’s comprehensive coverage of the annual NFL Draft, hosting the Day 2 telecast from 2004 to 2006, and leading analysis segments on Day 1. For the 1999 through 2003 NFL seasons, Kolber hosted &quot;NFL Matchup&quot;. She also previously contributed “Backstage” segments to &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;.

During the NFL off-season, Kolber served as an anchor on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and as an on-site and studio host for ESPN&#x27;s tennis coverage at the French Open from 2004 to 2006) and Wimbledon from 2003 to 2006 and in 2009.

In 1996, 2000, and 2001, she hosted the Summer X Games and Winter X Games, and co-hosted the event again in Aspen in 2006. She hosted horse racing events, including all three legs of the Triple Crown for ESPN and ESPN2 studio programs.

===Fox Sports===
Kolber left ESPN for Fox Sports in November 1996, where she anchored &quot;Fox Sports News&quot; for Fox Sports Net and reported from NFL games. She was the lead reporter for the network&#x27;s coverage of the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot; teaming up with the network&#x27;s No. 1 announcer team of Pat Summerall and John Madden for one game in 1998. She also covered horse racing. She served as studio host for the network&#x27;s coverage of the &quot;NHL on Fox&quot;, including both the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals and the Playoffs.

In March 1999, Kolber co-hosted a Fox non-sports presentation with Maury Povich, &quot;Opening the Lost Tombs: Live From Egypt&quot;, an archaeological event that promised to &quot;unveil five-thousand year old mysteries.&quot; Fox&#x27;s TV cameras showed the first live excavation of Egypt&#x27;s ancient Giza plateau; Kolber reported live from the tomb. She returned to ESPN in August 1999.

===Return to ESPN===
Kolber returned to ESPN in August 1999 after originally joining the network in 1993 as co-host for ESPN2&#x27;s &quot;SportsNight&quot;, when the network debuted October 1 of that year. She later served as an anchor on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, a reporter on &quot;College GameDay&quot;, and co-host of the X Games in 1995 and 1996. Kolber also hosted ESPN2&#x27;s &quot;SportsFigures&quot;, which uses sports celebrities and analogies to teach math and physics.

While covering the 2011 NFL draft, Kolber came under fire for her interview with Mark Ingram II, who started to sob when Kolber read an e-mail from Ingram&#x27;s imprisoned father. The interview was perceived by some as being manipulative.

On September 13, 2011, ESPN2 debuted &quot;NFL32&quot;, co-hosted by Kolber and Chris Mortensen. With a backdrop similar to a sports bar, including wainscoting, sports memorabilia, and dark woodwork, the show focuses on &quot;dissect the biggest topics of the day from all 32 NFL teams,&quot; according to the network, and attributes much of its design to that of the &quot;Dan Patrick Show&quot;, a national radio and television show on DirecTV&#x27;s Audience network.

====The Namath incident====
On December 20, 2003, while Kolber was covering a New York Jets game, former New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath twice stated, in his televised sideline interview with Kolber, that he wanted to kiss her, and &quot;couldn&#x27;t care less about the team strugg-a-ling.&quot; Kolber responded, &quot;Thanks, Joe. I&#x27;ll take that as a huge compliment.&quot; Namath later apologized and blamed the incident on his intoxication.

Soon after, Namath entered an outpatient alcoholism treatment program. Namath chronicled the episode, including his battle with alcoholism in his book &quot;Namath&quot; and later said that remembering the embarrassment he felt after the interview aired helped him maintain a lasting sobriety.

====&quot;Monday Night Football&quot;====
Kolber joined ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; crew as a sideline reporter along with Michele Tafoya when the network took over the longtime football series from ABC Sports in 2006. After Tafoya left ESPN for NBC Sports at the end of the 2010 NFL season, ESPN used a rotating solo sideline reporter for the 2011 NFL season, with reporters Wendi Nix, Ed Werder, and Rachel Nichols stepping into the role each week, and Kolber used as a fill-in. Kolber requested to do more in-studio work so she didn&#x27;t have to be away from her child.

The show, &quot;NFL32&quot;, now calked &quot;NFL Insiders&quot;, was created as a result of this request. Lisa Salters was named the new full-time solo sideline reporter for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; starting with the 2012 NFL season, effectively ending Kolber&#x27;s tenure as sideline reporter for the show, although both Salters and Kolber continued to co-produce the show in some capacity.

====&quot;NASCAR Countdown&quot;====
In the two weeks prior to Kolber&#x27;s arrival in 2007, Brent Musburger was mysteriously absent from his position as lead host of &quot;NASCAR Countdown&quot; on the ABC/ESPN network. On the week of the race on May 19, ESPN gave no reason for his absence but announced Kolber as the new host of Nextel Cup and Busch Series studio programming. She was subsequently replaced by Allen Bestwick as host of &quot;NASCAR Countdown&quot;.

====&quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;====
After substituting for the then-ailing Stuart Scott during most of the 2014 NFL season, Kolber took over Scott&#x27;s role permanently as an on-site host of &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;, starting with the 2015 NFL season, after Scott died in January 2015.

====Termination====
Kolber was among 20 on-air employees ESPN laid off during cost cutting in June 2023.

===Endorsements===
Kolber&#x27;s football broadcast narrative is featured on Sega&#x27;s video game, &quot;ESPN NFL Football&quot; for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox and Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2.

Kolber is a national television spokesperson for Chevrolet and Pepsi-Cola commercials.

In 1995&#x27;s &quot;ESPN Extreme Games&quot; for PlayStation, she has multiple video sequences hyping up the player, introducing levels, and hinting at secret areas. The re-release of the game, &quot;1Xtreme&quot;, removed all of her videos, and any reference to ESPN.

<doc id="1247202" wikidata="Q1123967" url="?curid=1247202" title="Conching">
<text>Conching is a process used in the manufacture of chocolate whereby a surface scraping mixer and agitator, known as a conche, evenly distributes cocoa butter within chocolate and may act as a &quot;polisher&quot; of the s. It also promotes flavor development through frictional heat, release of volatiles and acids, and oxidation. The name arises from the shape of the vessels initially used which resembled conch shells.

When ingredients are mixed in this way, sometimes for up to 78 hours, chocolate can be produced with a mild, rich taste. Since the process is so important to the final texture and flavor of chocolate, manufacturers keep the details of their conching process proprietary.

The conching techique was introduced in Switzerland in the late 19th century. Conched chocolates were distinguished from ordinary chocolates with the French adjective &quot;fondant&quot; or &quot;crémant&quot;.

== History ==

Rodolphe Lindt invented the conche in Berne, in 1879. It produced chocolate with superior aroma and melting characteristics compared to other processes used at that time. The Lindt chocolate company states that Lindt (perhaps mistakenly) allowed a mixer containing chocolate to run over a weekend (or possibly overnight, according to other variants of the possibly apocryphal story). Upon returning to the device, Lindt recognised the final product to have a smoother texture and greater shine than conventionally processed chocolate of the time. Lindt&#x27;s invention made the mass-production of chocolate bars more practical, eventually replacing chocolate beverages as the primary means of mass chocolate consumption. The adoption of conching also generalized the use of additional cocoa butter in the chocolate production; until then, molded chocolate often simply consisted of cocoa mass and sugar.

The original machine used by Lindt was developed in the early 1800s by an Italian chocolatier named Bozelli. The Bozelli grinding process was based on ancient Mesoamerican practices of grinding cocoa beans on curved stones, which were called &quot;metates&quot;.

Lindt&#x27;s original conche consisted of a granite roller and granite trough; such a configuration is now called a &quot;long conche&quot; and can take more than a day to process a tonne of chocolate. The ends of the trough were shaped to allow the chocolate to be thrown back over the roller at the end of each stroke, increasing the surface area exposed to air. A modern rotary conche can process 3 to 10 tonnes of chocolate in less than 12 hours. Modern conches have cooled jacketed vessels containing long mixer shafts with radial arms that press the chocolate against vessel sides. A single machine can carry out all the steps of grinding, mixing, and conching required for small batches of chocolate.

The conching process remained mostly a trade secret until the end of the century. In the 1890s, Cailler launched a similar chocolate. A long conche was manufactured by J. M. Lehmann from 1899.

== Process ==
Conching redistributes the substances from the dry cocoa that create flavor into the fat phase. Air flowing through the conche removes some unwanted acetic, propionic, and butyric acids from the chocolate and reduces moisture. Even a small amount of moisture greatly increases the viscosity of the finished chocolate, so machinery is cleaned with cocoa butter instead of water. Some of the substances produced in the roasting of cocoa beans are oxidized in the conche, mellowing the flavor of the product.

The temperature of the conche is controlled and varies for different types of chocolate. Generally, higher temperature leads to a shorter required processing time. Temperature varies from around for milk chocolate to up to for dark chocolate. The elevated temperature leads to a partially caramelized flavor and in milk chocolate promotes the Maillard reaction.

The chocolate passes through three phases during conching. In the dry phase the material is in powdery form, and the mixing coats the particles with fat. Air movement through the conche removes some moisture and volatile substances, which may give an acidic note to the flavor. Moisture balance affects the flavor and texture of the finished product because, after the particles are coated with fat, moisture and volatile chemicals are less likely to escape.

In the pasty phase more of the particles are coated with the fats from the cocoa. The power required to turn the conche shafts increases at this step.

The final liquid phase allows minor adjustment to the viscosity of the finished product by addition of fats and emulsifiers, depending on the intended use of the chocolate.

While most conches are batch-process machines, continuous-flow conches separate the stages with , over which the product travels through separate parts of the machine. A continuous conche can reduce the conching time for milk chocolate to as little as four hours.

After conching is completed, the flavor continues to change as it tastes increasingly acidic.

==Plot==
Set in Edo period, Shiina Yuya, a bounty hunter, is searching for her brother&#x27;s murderer. However, Yuya quickly meets a medicine peddler named Mibu Kyoshiro, who turns out to be sharing a body with the feared samurai Demon Eyes Kyo. Kyo&#x27;s only stated wish is to regain his own body. Following this path leads Kyo, Yuya and a variety of fellow travelers into conflict with both the Tokugawa shogunate and the Mibu tribe, a race of violent superhumans who have run Japan from the shadows for millennia.

==Characters==
:
:He is known for his demonic blood-red eyes and is one of the most feared samurai in the world. He carries a legendary &quot;ōdachi&quot; called Tenro (Heavenly Wolf), made by mastersmith Muramasa. In the manga, he is depicted as a cold, unbeatable samurai. When he was young, he was shunned by all of the Mibu clan for his demonic red eyes except for the Sendai Aka no Ou (Former Crimson King). After killing Oda Nobunaga, he was thrown into the Mibu dungeons until Muramasa rescued him and trained him in Mumyo Jinpu Ryuu. Kyo is the last remaining True Mibu. Sendai Aka no Ou asked Kyo to seek out the outside world and one day stop the former King himself if he was to become evil and destroy the world.
:
:A remarkable and mysterious swordsman, depicted as the only rival to Demon Eyes Kyo. He wielded the &quot;Shibien&quot; (Black Sword), one of the Muramasa weapons. In the manga, he is depicted as one of the heirs to the Aka no Ou throne, the Red Eyes being proof of his Mibu lineage. He is a &quot;Red Cross Knight&quot;, created from the flesh of the Sendai Aka no Ou. Though he is able to control the Red Eyes, he is not a true Mibu, but merely a more powerful battle doll resembling the first generation of battle dolls created. It is depicted that he is stronger than Demon Eyes Kyo until near the end of the manga.
:
:A young woman who makes a living as a professional bounty hunter in order to track down her brother&#x27;s killer, the &quot;Man with the Scar on His Back&quot;. She uses a three barreled gun and small daggers as defensive weapons. Yuya is actually an orphan found by her &quot;brother&quot;, Nozomu, and raised by him as an adoptive sister. He was Sakuya&#x27;s biological brother. Unlike many of the characters, Yuya is a normal human without any powers, despite the former Crimson King suspecting she can see the future later in the story.
:
:Also known as , the heir to the throne of the Tokugawa clan. He is also known as &quot;The Shadow Master&quot; due to his ability to make multiple copies of himself. He first appeared in volume 2 of the manga, accompanying White Crow. He later challenges Kyoshiro, who he thought was Kyo, to a fight. Benitora loses and decides to join their group.
:He immediately takes a romantic interest in Shiina Yuya, although the feeling is not returned. Note: Benitora translates to &#x27;Red Tiger&#x27;.
:
:A famous general who lost the battle of Sekigahara and ultimately Japan. He escaped Kudoyama and planned the assassination of Tokugawa Ieyasu, though it was never carried out. Yukimura travels with Kyo in order to defeat the Mibu Clan and Oda Nobunaga. In doing so, this would free Japan from the Mibu Clan&#x27;s shadow governing and give Yukimura a chance at taking over Japan.
:Ruled by The Crimson King. Most of their members are humanoid in appearance but have very long lives compared to humans and have great strength and power. The lower ranked Mibu are sometimes in humanoid shape with abnormal bodies, i.e. three eyes or clawed hands. These were created by experiments on humans and animals to replenish the clan, because natural childbirth has stopped in the Mibu clan for unknown reasons. The Mibu clan are said to possess the most advanced knowledge in sciences and technology and have been manipulating the country&#x27;s history from the shadows by helping the Shoguns. They decide to rule the country directly when Ieyasu Tokugawa becomes the first shogun to ever rebel against their power.
:All of the current Mibu are battle dolls made by True Mibu, except for Demon Eyes Kyo, the last remaining True Mibu. But as generations passed, True Mibu started engaging in civil wars to seek greater power, which ended up in the destruction of their very clan with only battle dolls remaining. Present Mibu are dying off due to the Death Disease which is caused by their flaw as battle dolls created by True Mibu. Kyoshiro and Chinmei are also battle dolls, but a more powerful version created by the first generation battle doll, the former Aka no Ou. They are called &quot;sons of the God&quot;, and have limited power compared to what a True Mibu has. Eventually, they will also inherit Death Disease and die.

<text>Michael Peter Finnissy (born 17 March 1946) is an English composer, pianist, and pedagogue. An immensely prolific composer, his music is &quot;notable for its dramatic urgency and expressive immediacy&quot;.

Although he rejects the label, he is often regarded as the foremost composer of the New Complexity movement.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Michael Finnissy was born at 77 Claverdale Road in Tulse Hill, London at roughly two in the morning on 17 March 1946 to Rita Isolene (&quot;née&quot; Parsonson) and George Norman Finnissy. His father was employed at the London City Council.

When he was four, he received his first piano lessons from his great aunt Rose Louise (Rosie) Hopwood, soon after writing his first compositions,

He attended Hawes Down Infant and Junior schools, Bromley Technical High School, and Beckenham and Penge Grammar School, and excelled in graphic art, mathematics, and English literature.

=== Student years ===
Finnissy received the William Hurlstone composition prize at the Croydon Music Festival, a factor which assisted his parents&#x27; decision to let him apply to music college.

He was then awarded a Foundation Scholarship to study at the Royal College of Music where he then studied with Bernard Stevens and Humphrey Searle. Soon after, he received an Octavia travelling scholarship to study in Italy with Roman Vlad. Finnissy was then able to befriend Brian Ferneyhough.

In 1968, he wrote his first proper compositions.

=== Professional career ===
To earn money for his classes he took up a job as a répétiteur and freelanced at the London Contemporary Dance School and founded a department there, as well as working with numerous choreographers.

In 1972 he made his concert début in the Galerie Schwartzes Kloster in Freiburg im Breisgau. Meanwhile, he had been appearing around Europe.

Finnissy&#x27;s first job as a composition teacher was at Dartington Summer School where he taught along with his colleague Ferneyhough and signed contracts with numerous publishers, including Oxford University Press.

He had been a member of the ensemble &quot;Suoraan&quot; (founded by James Clarke and Richard Emsley) and then its artistic director since the early 1970s, then joining &quot;Ixion&quot; (founded and still directed by Andrew Toovey) in 1987 - in both of these groups he not only played the piano but also conducted concerts.

Finnissy was invited to join by Justin Connolly to join the International Society for Contemporary Music and was president from 1990 to 1996. He is currently an Honorary Member.

He has attached to C.O.M.A. (initially known as the East London Late Starters Orchestra) since its inception, and is composer-in-residence Victorian College of the Arts and to the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras in Sydney. He has taught at the Royal Academy of Music, the University of Sussex, and is professor of composition at the University of Southampton and composer-in-residence at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He won a competition to supply a violin solo test piece to the 1990 Carl Flesch International Violin Competition with &quot;Enek&quot;.

Finnissy completed his Verdi Transcriptions for piano (which he started in 1972) in 2005.

He is homosexual.

== Music ==
=== Works ===
=== Style ===
Finnissy is a profusely prolific composer, having written over 400 pieces for numerous ensembles, combinations, and instruments. His works for the piano are notable for their extreme demands on technique. They include his 36 &quot;Verdi Transcriptions&quot;, written between 1972 and 2005.

Finnissy is concerned with the political aspects of music, and he believes that all music is &#x27;programmatic&#x27; to some degree, that is, a composition exists in not just the composer&#x27;s mind, but inside a culture that reflects both the extra-musical and purely musical concerns of the composer. Music, far from being unable to express anything other than itself (as Stravinsky said) is a force for change. This engagement with political and social themes became more frequent as his career progressed. For example, the influence of homosexual themes and concerns began to enter his work; as in &quot;Shameful Vice&quot; in 1994, and more explicitly in &quot;Seventeen Immortal Homosexual Poets&quot; in 1997.

<text>Poison Elves is a black-and-white comic book by the late artist/writer Drew Hayes, concerning the life and times of an elf named Lusiphur.

==Origins and influences==
Drew Hayes&#x27; work was influenced by &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Elfquest&quot;, and &quot;Cerebus&quot;. Lusiphur was originally one of Hayes&#x27; Dungeons &amp; Dragons characters. The book version of the character was based on Lux Interior of The Cramps, Glenn Danzig of The Misfits, and Nivek Ogre of Skinny Puppy.

==Publication history==
Hayes originally self-published the series during the early 1990s, under his company Mulehide Graphics, under the title of &quot;I, Lusiphur&quot;. The title was changed to &quot;Poison Elves&quot; because the similarity of &quot;Lusiphur&quot; to Lucifer led to the misconception that the series was Satanic in nature. Hayes claimed in one of his &quot;Starting Notes&quot; that the name-change was prompted by a letter from a teenage fan whose mother had thrown out his comics after finding &quot;I, Lusiphur&quot; comics amongst his collection. Sales were reported to have increased significantly after the name change.

The first ten issues of the Mulehide series were published in a larger magazine-size format.

In 1995, Drew Hayes signed on with Sirius Entertainment, a move that increased his exposure, fan base, and publishing rate. Sirius published &quot;Poison Elves&quot; through issue #79 (Nov, 2007), collecting them in twelve trade paperbacks through issue #75. Hayes died in 2007, bringing the series to an abrupt end. A commemorative issue #80 was released to give fans a look at sketches and plans Drew Hayes had for the future of the series before his death.

Beginning in March 2014, a continuation of the original series, &quot;Drew Hayes Poison Elves&quot;, based on Hayes&#x27; outline for future issues, was published by Ape Entertainment. Written by Sirius publisher Robb Horan and illustrated by Osvaldo Pestana Montpeller, the story picks up almost precisely at the cliffhanger point at the end of the original issue #79. Only three issues were published before the series abruptly ended, which was possibly connected to Ape Entertainment CEO David Hedgecock leaving the company to join IDW Publishing. An unknown number of completed issues remain unpublished.

On July 20, 2023, Sirius Entertainment launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund the completion of the first volume of a series of five volumes to collect the entirety of Poison Elves in print and digital formats. A second successful Kickstarter campaign launched on June 8, 2024 to fund the second volume of the series.

== Background and setting ==
Amrahly&#x27;nn, the world of &quot;Poison Elves&quot;, is one where magic and technology meet. An example of this is Lusiphur&#x27;s magical semi-automatic handgun that never runs out of bullets. Hayes had described the world as &quot;...a mix of Tolkien&#x27;s Middle Earth and the Neo-Romantic world seen in the Adam and the Ants video for &#x27;Stand and Deliver&#x27;&quot;.

===Characters===

==== Lusiphur ====
Lusiphur, originally named Luis Amerillis Malaché, was found by a married elven couple in the Carpathian forest in 1380. He grew up in their inn in Port Sarnwog. However, his childhood was an unhappy one after a drunken patron set fire to their establishment leaving his adoptive parents desperate for money. His father sank into depression and was later killed in one of the city&#x27;s violent class wars. With nowhere left to turn, his mother was forced to enter into the only profession she could, prostitution.

In 1390, things took a turn for the worse when an abusive client battered Luse&#x27;s mother. She escaped without being beaten to death, but in her hurry, she stepped on a nail. The wound became infected and gangrene soon spread, crippling her and leaving her bedridden indefinitely. Her Elvin immune system prevented her from dying, prolonging her suffering until she begged a young Luse to end her suffering. With no money for a doctor or medicine, the young elf had little choice. He slit her wrists with a razor blade to set her free from the suffering. The image of her death would haunt Luse for the rest of his life.

The orphaned Luse learned to survive on the streets alone where he adopted a new identity which he uses today, Lusiphur Malaché. He spent his younger years working for a crime lord called The Nick, where he was involved in risky heists. During this tumultuous time in his life, he met and fell in love with the beautiful priestess Elf, Lirilith. However, he was unable to leave the gang and the continuing life of crime drove the young lovers apart. (This part of Lusiphur&#x27;s life is chronicled in the mini series, &quot;Lusiphur and Lirilith&quot; written by Drew Hayes and illustrated by Jason Shawn Alexander).

==Plot==
The beginning sees Lusiphur left to die in a desert. He makes use of a lamp, with the subsequent genie, that he received after trading the dead body of a Doppleganger to his ex-wife, Hyena. After a failed attempt to ask for a million wishes, he settles on three: A powerful Elven sword named Cinlach, super speed to get out of the desert, and the &quot;well of souls,&quot; an assassin tool.

Genie gives him the wishes. But to give them, she has to take them from somewhere. Cinlach comes from an Elven Warduke named Ailwon Sann Fenlach, who quickly notices it missing. He is a veteran of many long-ago wars against the Orcs even if age and time have worn down his fighting acumen. Sann Fenlach has his mage transport him to Lusiphur&#x27;s location in the desert where he challenges the elf to a duel for stealing his property. At first the Fenlach is winning, due in part to his mage immediately fixing any wounds Lusiphur can inflict.

The turning point comes when a magician named Tenth steps in. Tenth was quietly reading in his study when he felt a temporary shock. The genie drained his power to accommodate Lusiphur&#x27;s request for super speed. Tenth also pinpoints where Lusiphur is located and sees that he is currently fighting Sann Fenlach. He also sees the disparity in the fight. Lusiphur is a young but experienced assassin, having to fight for everything he ever had. The High Lord is sedentary, fighting his last significant battle hundreds of years ago. In the meantime he has been sitting on his throne recounting past battles. Tenth sees that he is relying too much on the magical connection and severs it.

After Lushiphur defeats the High Lord when the odds are more even, he starts burying the body. Tenth then arrives to take back the small sliver of power that Lusiphur took from him. Tenth wants it to be a fair contest however. Lusiphur could best Tenth in a physical contest and Tenth could destroy Lusiphur quickly if he chose. The wizard has not had a challenge in a while, and so decides to make a sport of it.

In &quot;Tenth&#x27;s Game,&quot; the Elf is given a fighting chance: Make it across 50 meters through an arch. If he does he will survive. His only weapon is a temporary power of shape-changing into animals given to him by Tenth. The wizard promises to only use his shape-changing powers in return.

The two play a cat-and-mouse game, Lusiphur at one point turning into panther-like creature to fend off Tenth who had become a hawk. Tenth turns to a fly, so Lusiphur turns to a rattle snake, but he cannot figure out how to move a rattlesnake. This was when Tenth turns to a Unicorn, causing Lusiphur to panic and he chose a Nightmare (A black batwinged unicorn that bleeds acid and breathes fire.) Tenth becomes a Drake, where as Lusiphur turns to a black Dragon, knocking Tenth into a mountain. After recovering Tenth becomes a gold dragon, the two fight. Lusiphur gets his teeth on Tenth&#x27;s throat. Up to this point in his existence Tenth has thoroughly beaten any competitor. Lusiphur has made the wizard fear for his life for the first time in many years. The dragon battle drags on, until Lusiphur disappears. Tenth assumes he is dead and scans the ground for his body. As Tenth searches for Lusiphur&#x27;s body, he tries to go through the gate as a dragon, but he finds he can&#x27;t fit. So Tenth becomes a Hell hound and goes through the gate, the moment he crosses it, Lusiphur appears out of nowhere and nearly carves Tenth&#x27;s heart out. Lusiphur had become a flea and let Tenth carry him through the gate.

<text>Emmanuel Babatunde Baiyewu (born 25 November 1968), better known as Tunde Baiyewu, is a British singer and songwriter of Nigerian descent, best known as the vocalist of Lighthouse Family. When the group went on hiatus in 2003, Baiyewu embarked on a solo career, releasing the albums &quot;Tunde&quot; (2004) and &quot;Diamond in a Rock&quot; (2013).

==Early life and career==
Tunde Baiyewu was born in London to a middle-class family of Nigerian descent. His father worked as an engineer but died of cancer when Baiyewu was five, after which the boy moved to Nigeria with his mother and younger sister in order for the family to be closer to relatives. Baiyewu learned to speak Yoruba after moving to Nigeria and attended a boarding school near the then-capital, Lagos. Ten years later, he returned to Britain, attending the University of Northumbria in Newcastle upon Tyne and obtained a degree in accounting. He subsequently met Paul Tucker, who was also at university in Newcastle and working in the bar scene. Their partnership began, and they formed Lighthouse Family.

Lighthouse Family released their debut album, &quot;Ocean Drive&quot;, with the lead single, &quot;Lifted&quot;, reaching the top five on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Ocean Drive&quot; was certified six-times Platinum by the end of 1997, selling more than 1.8 million copies in the UK alone and spending 154 weeks on the UK Albums Chart. Lighthouse Family’s follow-up album, &quot;Postcards from Heaven&quot;, achieved similar sales status in 1997, reaching six-times Platinum status, and &quot;Whatever Gets You Through the Day&quot; also received Platinum status. The duo has sold over fifteen million albums throughout their career.

In 2004, Baiyewu released his debut solo album, &quot;Tunde&quot;.

In 2005, he appeared on the BBC Television one-off special &quot;Strictly African Dancing&quot;, finishing last.

On 12 November 2006, Baiyewu appeared in an ITV documentary called &quot;Faith in Music&quot;. This documentary charted his life and music, from his roots in Africa, through Lighthouse Family and into his solo incarnation. It also showed him performing an acoustic set featuring tracks from his latest album.

In 2013, Baiyewu announced plans for a second solo album, titled &quot;Diamond in a Rock&quot;, which was released, together with the single &quot;Move&quot;, on 4 March 2013.

In October 2013, Baiyewu joined M People as a support act during their &quot;20th Anniversary Greatest Hits Tour&quot;.

In 2019, Lighthouse Family released a new album, &quot;Blue Sky in Your Head&quot;. The group&#x27;s first record in eighteen years, it was supported by two sell-out UK tours. The duo split in July 2022 and did not perform at the Mouth of the Tyne Festival, as they had agreed, despite the show selling out.

Since 2020, Baiyewu has been working on a new collection of recordings, inspired by the artists and the singer-songwriter era of the 1970s. Reunited with Lighthouse Family producer Mike Peden, he has recorded a selection of Troubadour-influenced songs, including compositing by Elton John, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, James Taylor, Leon Russell, Cat Stevens, Van Morrison, David Gates, Bill Withers, Todd Rundgren, and Barry White.

==Personal life==
After Baiyewu&#x27;s father&#x27;s death, his mother went on to marry former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo. She died in 2000.

In March 2007, Baiyewu married Tope Adeshina, a Nigerian model, in Lagos, Nigeria. They live in the UK.

<doc id="1247214" wikidata="Q1406356" url="?curid=1247214" title="List of state highways in Hawaii">
<text>The Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) maintains the smallest state-maintained system of state highways in the country. It consists of Interstates, state highways, and secondary state highways, totaling approximately .

The state&#x27;s four Interstates, all located on O‘ahu, are built to mainland standards unlike their counterparts in Alaska and Puerto Rico. The first three routes (H-1, H-2, and H-3) were approved in 1960, while an auxiliary route (H-201) was added in 1989.
==Primary and auxiliary interstates==



==Primary and secondary routes==
The current state (then territorial) highway numbering system was established in 1955. Route numbers are organized so that the initial digit corresponds to the island:
* Numbers beginning with 1 or 2: Hawaiʻi
* Numbers beginning with 3: Maui
* Numbers beginning with 4: Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi
* Numbers beginning with 5: Kauaʻi
* Numbers beginning with 6 to 9: Oʻahu

In general, two-digit numbers are primary highways, maintained by the state. Three-digit routes are typically secondary arterials or collectors, while four-digit routes are typically collectors and minor roads. For secondary routes, the first two digits generally relate to the associated primary route. Many secondary routes are county-maintained and unsigned, their route numbers being used merely by state agencies as an asset-tracking measure.

When referring to highways, Hawaiʻi residents usually refer to state highways by their names instead of their route numbers (e.g. &quot;Kamehameha Highway&quot; instead of Route 99). Note that one named highway may encompass several route numbers (e.g. Kamehameha Highway, which carries Routes 80, 83, 99, and 830 at various points along its length) and vice versa.
































































































































































































==Temporary Federal routes==
During World War II, a temporary Federal route numbering system was setup on the island of Oahu. They were used to assist military personnel not accustomed to the Hawaiian street names during the time of Martial law in the Territory of Hawaii from 1941 to 1945. Though marked with U.S. Route shields, they were never part of the United States Numbered Highway System.

<doc id="1247216" wikidata="Q6140342" url="?curid=1247216" title="Katsuhiko Oku">
<text>Katsuhiko Oku (奥 克彦 &quot;Oku Katsuhiko&quot;, 3 January 1958 – 29 November 2003) was a Japanese diplomat who played rugby for Oxford and Waseda University. In Britain he was known as &quot;Katsu&quot;.

== Character and life ==
A very popular and dynamic personality, he later became a diplomat and was sent from the Japanese embassy in London to Iraq where he was killed by unknown assailants with his colleague Masamori Inoue and their Iraqi driver when their car was ambushed on 29 November 2003 near Tikrit. He was promoted posthumously to ambassador in recognition of his work by the Japanese foreign ministry (Gaimusho).

Oku made a point of visiting many countries and finding out what the local people wanted. He saw it as the first duty of a diplomat.

Since 2004 an Oku Memorial Trophy has been contested annually in Richmond, London by the Kew Occasionals club (founded by Katsu Oku&#x27;s good friend Reg Clark), London Japanese RFC and some Japanese teams. (See RFU&#x27;s official newspaper &quot;Touchline&quot;, February 2007 issue).

== Charitable fund ==
A charitable fund has been set up in his name for the children of Iraq and a collection at the 2004 Oxford-Cambridge Varsity Match went towards that fund. Proceeds from the recent game in Japan between Waseda and Oxford (which Waseda won for the first time ever) also went to the fund, and the game was called the Katsuhiko Oku Memorial match. It was played on 20 September 2004 and Waseda won 25-9. The average weight of the forwards was Oxford 107 kg, Waseda 99 kg. The record now stands at one win, one draw and ten losses.

Katsuyuki Kiyomiya, the coach of Waseda&#x27;s highly successful rugby team 2001–2006, was a friend of Mr. Oku, and is a trustee of his memorial fund in Japan. Together they invented a slogan &quot;ULTIMATE CRUSH&quot;.

<doc id="1247217" wikidata="Q4046387" url="?curid=1247217" title="Pangbourne College">
<text>Pangbourne College is a coeducational public school (private boarding and day school), for pupils aged 13-18 years, located in the village of Pangbourne, in Berkshire, in the United Kingdom. It is set in 230 acres, on a hill south-west of the village, in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The college was founded by Sir Thomas Lane Devitt Bt. in 1917 as The Nautical College, Pangbourne with the purpose of training boys to become Merchant Navy officers. It became &quot;Pangbourne College&quot; in 1969 and while conforming to the general lines of a British independent boarding school, retains a distinctly nautical flavour; the pupils wear naval uniform.

==History==
The college was founded by Sir Thomas Lane Devitt, 1st Baronet, in 1917 as &quot;The Nautical College, Pangbourne&quot;, on the site originally occupied by Clayesmore School, now located in Dorset. The Nautical College&#x27;s purpose was to prepare boys to become officers in the Merchant Navy through his shipping company Devitt and Moore, although both he, and later his son, Sir Phillip Devitt, also wanted the boys to have a well-rounded education in case they later changed their minds about going to sea. At the time of founding the German campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare was at its height, and this was one reason for a nautical training school to be sited inland. Almost immediately after founding, the Admiralty took a keen interest, and naval uniform together with the status of cadet in the Royal Naval Reserve was awarded to every student, putting the college in line with similar schools at that time, such as HMS &quot;Worcester&quot; and HMS &quot;Conway&quot;. These last two institutions closed in 1968 and 1974 respectively as the number of young men seeking a career at sea declined, and in 1969 The Nautical College, Pangbourne became &quot;Pangbourne College&quot;. This also saw a shift in emphasis to a stronger academic programme, and with a civilian headmaster to replace the former post of captain superintendent. Directors of studies were replaced by the post of second master. The fourth, and current, headmaster, Thomas Garnier, served in the Royal Navy before switching to a career in teaching. He taught physics and was a housemaster before becoming headmaster in 2005.

In addition to normal academic subjects, the college&#x27;s curriculum included the teaching of seamanship and navigation, theoretical and practical, to O Level for all boys, and to Higher National Diploma (A Level equivalent) in Seamanship for cadets wishing to embark on a career in the Merchant Navy.

Originally catering to about 200 male &quot;cadets&quot; bound largely for service in the Merchant and Royal Navies, the school now has approximately 400 co-educational pupils, both day and boarding. It has a Christian ethos, takes a wide range of academic abilities and focuses on the development of the whole person, particularly including &quot;courtesy and self-discipline&quot;, &quot;supporting the success of others&quot; and &quot;aiming high&quot;.
For most of its history, the college numbered on average around 200 cadets in any given year. Recently numbers have expanded to an average complement of around 400, due in part to the college becoming co-educational in 1996 and opening a junior house.

A number of naval traditions are maintained. The college holds a parade seven times a year, culminating on &#x27;Founders Day&#x27; with the ceremony of &quot;beat the retreat&quot;. While the title of &quot;cadet&quot; for pupils has fallen into disuse, pupils continue to wear naval uniform on a daily basis, including the traditional rank slides of a Royal Navy cadet. College argot reflects the nautical traditions, with &quot;cabins&quot; instead of study bedrooms, &quot;gunrooms&quot; instead of pupil common rooms, &quot;galleys&quot; instead of kitchens, and so on. A focus on water-borne sports, including rowing and sailing, remains a legacy of a nautical past.

==Academic==
Pangbourne takes students with a range of academic abilities, the majority of whom enter via common entrance at 11 or 13 and a few at sixth form (16+). Subjects are taught at both GCSE and A-level.
&quot;The Good Schools Guide&quot; describes Pangbourne as &quot;A small, distinctive, grounded and family-oriented school that puts huge emphasis on self-discipline, teamwork and leadership. Caring and supportive, Pangbourne buzzes with activity and encourages every pupil to have a go.&quot; The college has a boarding culture with around forty per-cent of the pupils boarding on a full, weekly or part-week basis. An Independent Schools Inspectorate visit in November 2019 reported the college to be &quot;excellent&quot; in all nine of its categories.

==Divisions==
The boarding houses at Pangbourne are known as &quot;divisions&quot;.

&quot;*Pupils aged from 11–13 years belong to Dunbar.&quot;

All of the divisions are named after ships operated at various times by the Devitt and Moore Line, and all contain roughly 60 pupils. Every pupil at Pangbourne is allocated to a boarding house when applying to Pangbourne whether he or she is a boarder or day pupil. Pangbourne does not use the system whereby scholars live in their own separate house, but instead chooses to integrate them into regular divisions. The divisions constantly compete against each other in sports and extra-curricular activities, ranging from debating and singing to running and marching. The division which has performed best at the end of the year is presented with the coveted Headmaster&#x27;s Cup on Founder&#x27;s Day. Each division is staffed by a housemaster or housemistress, assistant housemaster or mistress, a matron, and a number of house tutors. In addition to these, each division has a chief, one or more deputy chiefs, and a new entry cadet officer drawn from among the senior pupils.

==Extracurricular activities==
===Sport===
Pangbourne offers students a range of sports with professional coaching. The performance of the Pangbourne College Boat Club is exceptional. The school has won the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup four times at the Henley Royal Regatta.

The college has a rugby club, with the first XV progressing to the latter stages of the Daily Mail Cup in recent years. (FTC) 
In 2013 &quot;The Red Wall&quot; became associated with the London Irish Rugby Club. This now gives team members access to professional training through the London Irish&#x27;s Academy. A number of Pangbournians have gone on to play at county, academy and national level, whilst still at the school.

=== Non-sporting activities ===
The college has a Combined Cadet Force contingent consisting of three sections: Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Army. In the year 2013-2014 13 pupils went to the Falkland Islands to complete their gold award expedition.

There is a marching band. Formed originally to provide fifes, drums and bugles to lead parades, it has now developed brass and wind sections as well, and performs outside the college for charity events. Each year it leads the Remembrance Sunday service parade through Pangbourne village.

The school has a new music centre. It has inaugurated the Pangbourne College piano festival, in which participating pupils come from all over the Home Counties and London to take part, using the pianos in its three recital halls. There is an annual Pangbourne College composers` competition.

==Leadership and prefects==
==Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel==

The Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel at the school was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 2000. It was built to commemorate the lives and sacrifice of all those who died during the Falklands War of 1982, and the courage of those who served with them to protect the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands. The shape of the building was designed to resemble a ship, reflecting the college&#x27;s naval history. It was largely due to this history that the college was chosen as the site for this national memorial chapel, together with the fact that 45 Old Pangbournians (OP) served in the Falklands conflict. More than a third of these OPs were either decorated or mentioned in despatches; most publicly known of the OPs taking part at the time were D.H. Scott-Masson (Pangbourne 1944–46) who was captain of &quot;Canberra&quot;, the P&amp;O liner converted to troop ship and hospital ship for the conflict; and Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ewen Southby-Tailyour RM (Pangbourne 1955–59), who was one of the first ashore with the retaking of the islands. A gifted yachtsman, he is also an author, and among other books, he had published a detailed sailing guide to the coasts around the islands called &quot;Falkland Island Shores&quot;, which was withdrawn by the Ministry of Defence at the outbreak of hostilities. The Queen returned to the college in 2007, together with the Duke of Edinburgh, the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the then-current Prime Minister Tony Blair, and service chiefs responsible for the conduct of that war, to mark the 25th anniversary of the Argentine surrender. Links between the Falkland Islands and the college were also recently highlighted by the visit this year to the chapel of the Falkland Islands Governor, Mr. Colin Roberts.

On the south side of the building, there is the World War II memorial window, commemorating more than 200 former cadets who lost their lives in that conflict. A number of medals and citations were won during this war by Old Pangbournians, including 2 George Crosses for service in the Merchant Navy: an Albert Medal won for saving life at sea in the Mediterranean, and converted to a George Cross in 1971; and a George Cross awarded in naval bomb disposal. A further 31 Distinguished Service Orders, 91 Distinguished Service Crosses, and 2 George Medals were awarded. The window denotes an airman, a Merchant Navy seaman, a commando and a naval officer. It was transferred from the college&#x27;s former St. Nicholas Chapel.

Pangbourne&#x27;s war effort was so significant that it prompted a special visit from King George VI and his daughter, the then Princess Elizabeth, for the Founder&#x27;s Day prize giving in 1943, at the height of the war. The college has had many other visits from members of the British Royal Family over the years, beginning with the Prince of Wales in 1927 for the college&#x27;s tenth anniversary - he later became Edward VIII; and continuing with visits from Princess Alice through to four further visits by the Queen; four from the Duke of Edinburgh; a visit from Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 1980; and visits from Earl Mountbatten, The Princess Royal and the Duke of York, who is also Patron of the chapel. 
The most recent visit by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh took place on May 9, 2017, with a service in the chapel, followed by a parade, to help mark the college&#x27;s centennial year.

Each seat has been donated by an organisation or individual, and under each seat is a kneeler with the name of one of the Falklands` casualties.

The chapel was the winner of &quot;Private Eye&#x27;s&quot; Sir Hugh Casson Award for the worst new building of the year in 2000, with the magazine&#x27;s architecture critic, &#x27;Piloti&#x27;, describing it as &quot;&quot;so very like the Ruskin Library that its &#x27;architects&#x27; are obviously shameless&quot;.

<text>Jesse Bowman Aikin (1808–1900) was a shape note &quot;singing master&quot;, and compiler of the shape note tunebook &quot;The Christian Minstrel&quot;. He was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania and lived on a farm in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. Aikin, a member of the Church of the Brethren, was the first to successfully produce a song book (&quot;The Christian Minstrel&quot;) with a seven-shape note system, in 1846. He vigorously defended his &quot;invention&quot; and his patent, which included the elimination of bass and treble clefs and the simplification of time signatures. After the influential Ruebush &amp; Kieffer Publishing Company began using his notehead shapes around 1876 (previously they used Funk&#x27;s shapes), the Aikin shapes eventually became the prevailing standard in shape note and gospel music publication, although few other compilers adopted his other innovations.

Aikin&#x27;s names for the notes were originally written: Doe Ray Mee Faw Sole Law See. All the note stems pointed downwards, and the stems for Doe, Ray, and See were placed centrally on the shape, rather than to the side. These conventions were discarded by later users of his system, so as not to deviate so much from standard notation. The name See was also changed to Ti (as used in the Tonic sol-fa system), so as not to be confused with a sharpened Sol.

Today Aikin&#x27;s system is still in use, though it is often referred to as the &quot;Aiken&quot; system, a spelling error introduced by George Pullen Jackson and perpetuated by the Sibelius music notation program.

<text>Peter Alan Stollery (born November 29, 1935) is a former Canadian politician and businessman.

==Background==
An old Yorkville family, the Stollerys owned a furnishings store named Stollery&#x27;s, which opened in 1901 in downtown Toronto. Peter Stollery, the founder’s grandson, worked on and off at the haberdashery for 24 years, first as a furnishings’ man and eventually as a manager from 1965 to 1968 after his father, Alan Stollery, died suddenly. His attachment to these roots explain his later designation in the Senate of Canada as Senator for &quot;Bloor and Yonge&quot;, the intersection at which the store was located.

Before entering public life, Stollery also worked as a teacher in Algeria and travel writer for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;. He is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and a Member of the National Liberal Club in London.

==Career in Parliament==
Stollery was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal candidate in the 1972 election for Spadina riding in Toronto defeating incumbent MP Perry Ryan who had left the Liberals and crossed the floor to the Progressive Conservatives. He was re-elected in the 1974, 1979 and 1980 elections. He served for a time as chairman of the Liberal Caucus (1976–1978), and as parliamentary secretary to the Secretary of State and to the Minister of Communications (1980–1981).

In 1981, Stollery was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the recommendation of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Trudeau wanted to open Stollery&#x27;s Spadina riding so his aide James Coutts could be elected to Parliament in a by-election. The voters rebelled, and in the subsequent by-election Coutts was defeated in what had been a safe Liberal seat by Dan Heap of the New Democratic Party. He retired from the Senate on November 29, 2010, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, at which point he had served in Parliament for over 38 years, including more than 29 years in the Senate.

In the Senate, Stollery served on several committees. He took part in numerous overseas delegations and assumed the position of Chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs (1999–2005). He continued to serve on the committee as Vice-Chair until his retirement from the Senate. He has been involved with the Canada-Europe Interparliamentary Union.

==Controversy==
On May 29, 2006, during a session of the Standing Senate Committee on National Security and Defence, Stollery criticized Hamid Karzai, then President of Afghanistan. Although Karzai was democratically elected, Stollery implied that Karzai&#x27;s ascent to power was due to US influence. He argued that Canadian troops could be better used to help “create a democratic society in Afghanistan”.

In September 2006, Stollery added that the limited presence of Canadian troops on the African continent was a result of military officials believing it was not as &quot;sexy&quot; as helping the U.S. by fighting in Afghanistan. He was subsequently criticized by Liberal Senator Roméo Dallaire, who called Stollery&#x27;s comments &quot;scandalous language.&quot; Dallaire stated that &quot;Nothing is sexy in war. The whole concept of war is perverse, and the reason we&#x27;re in one area and not another is because political decisions have been taken.&quot;

<doc id="1247233" wikidata="Q214042" url="?curid=1247233" title="Christa Winsloe">
<text>Christa Winsloe (23 December 1888 – 10 June 1944), formerly Baroness Christa von Hatvany-Deutsch, was a German-Hungarian novelist, playwright and sculptor, best known for her play &quot;Gestern und heute&quot; (known under several titles, see below), filmed in 1931 as &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; and the 1958 remake. Winsloe was the first to write a play on female homosexuality in the Weimar Republic, yet without a &quot;radical critique of the social discrimination of lesbian women.&quot;

== Early life ==
Christa Kate Winsloe was born in Darmstadt to the military officer Arthur Winsloe and his wife Katharina Elisabeth Scherz. Her mother died unexpectedly in 1900. Upon her death, Christa was sent to the Kaiserin-Augusta-Stift, a very strict boarding school in Potsdam. In this institution, the girls of the aristocracy were drilled to learn discipline and submission. The experience would inspire Winsloe&#x27;s later body of work: &quot;as an adult Winsloe had to write down this nightmare to get it off her chest.&quot;

In 1909, she studied sculpture in Munich (specifically, her interest was sculpting animals), against her family&#x27;s consent. Sculpture-making was considered an &quot;unfeminine&quot; profession at the time.

In 1913, she married Baron (1880–1961), a rich Hungarian writer and landowner. Thus, she became known as Baroness Christa von Hatvany-Deutsch. While married to Hatvany, Winsloe began to write &quot;Das Mädchen Manuela&quot; (&quot;The Child Manuela&quot;), a short novel based on her experiences at Kaiserin-Augusta but held off on publishing. Soon after, her marriage failed, but Hatvany made Winsloe a generous allowance after the divorce.

Winsloe was involved in a relationship with newspaper reporter Dorothy Thompson, probably before World War II when Thompson was reporting from Berlin.

== Career ==
In 1930, Winsloe wrote the play ‘Knight Nerestan’ which was produced in Leipzig and then Berlin under the title &quot;Gestern und heute&quot; (‘Yesterday and Today&#x27;). The play&#x27;s success led to a 1931 film version called &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot; (Girls in Uniform) with Winsloe as one of the screenwriters. The play ends differently from the film. In the play, the young student, Manuela, is destroyed because of rejection by her teacher, Fräulein Elizabeth von Bernburg, who did not dare to side with Manuela against the headmistress or oppose the brutal educational methods. Manuela commits suicide. The film is more ambiguous, with von Bernburg attempting to defend the student and herself. The film version was also a considerable success, both financially and critically. This was due to its ambitiously aesthetic form and the fact that only women performed in it. The lesbian aspect of the story was downplayed and depicted as an adolescent crush, even though Winsloe co-authored the script, and Leontine Sagan, who in the play had stressed the lesbian aspect, acted as director.

In response to the play and film&#x27;s downplaying of the lesbian themes, Winsloe completed and published her novel &quot;Das Mädchen Manuela&quot; (The Child Manuela) in 1933. It was a bolder novelized version of the screenplay that emphasized the lesbian storyline.

Winsloe did not publish anymore after &quot;Das Mädchen Manuela&quot; because she did not want to write under the rules and conditions of the German Literature Department. Soon enough, all of Winsloe&#x27;s books and articles were on the Nazi index of &quot;undesired literature&quot;. The author was considered as &quot;politically unreliable&quot;. During World War II, however, she wrote scripts for G.W. Pabst.

== Personal life and death ==
On the strength of &quot;Mädchen in Uniform&quot;&#x27;s acclaim, Winsloe moved to Berlin, where at the time there was a lesbian sub-culture. She had plenty of money (from her ex-husband&#x27;s allowance), worked as an animal sculptor, and had a wide circle of friends. She was a member of the SPD (the German Social Democrats, then largely reform Marxist in orientation), and was open about her sexuality.

Early in World War II, Winsloe fled the Nazis with her partner, Dorothy Thompson (Thompson had warned against Hitler early on, and was one of the first women who interviewed Hitler). They spent time in Italy and then Winsloe followed Thompson to the U.S., but Winsloe did not like it there. Her scripts were rejected from Hollywood producers and she did not want to write in English, so she left Thompson and returned to Europe in 1935. She spent the next years travelling between Italy, France, Hungary, Austria, and Germany.

In October 1939, Winsloe moved south and settled in Cagnes, where she met the Swiss author Simone Gentet. They stayed together during the following years and Gentet translated some of Winsloe&#x27;s works into French. The two women also offered temporary support and refuge for people fleeing the Nazis.

Following an immediate evacuation order on 10 June 1944, Winsloe and Gentet were falsely accused of being Nazi spies by four Frenchmen. They shot and killed the two women in a forest near the country town of Cluny.

<text>Thomas Haughey Brown Jr. (January 29, 1950 – August 16, 2024) was an American naturalist, tracker, survivalist, and author from New Jersey, where he ran the Tom Brown Jr. Tracker School.

==Early life==
Brown was born in Toms River, New Jersey on January 29, 1950. From the age of seven, as Brown wrote in his books, he and his childhood friend Rick were trained in tracking and wilderness survival by Rick&#x27;s grandfather, &quot;Stalking Wolf&quot; (who Brown stated was Lipan Apache). Brown wrote that Stalking Wolf died when Brown was 17, and that Rick was killed in an accident in Europe shortly thereafter.

==Career==
Brown spent the next ten years working odd jobs to support his wilderness adventures. He then set out to find other people in New Jersey who were interested in his experiences. Initially Brown met with little success, but was eventually called on to help locate a crime suspect. Though the case won him national attention, he and authorities in the Ramsey, New Jersey area were subsequently sued for 5 million dollars for charging the wrong person. Despite this controversy, he was able to build on this exposure to develop a profession as a full-time tracker, advertising his services for locating lost persons, dangerous animals, and fugitives from the law. According to &quot;People&quot; magazine, &quot;He stalks men and animals, mostly in New Jersey.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that he &quot;was considered the country&#x27;s foremost authority on wilderness survival&quot;.

===The Tracker School===
Tom Brown Jr.&#x27;s Tracker School is located in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Most classes offered by Tracker School are held in Primitive Camp or Joseph Citta Boy Scout Camp, both of which are located near Waretown, New Jersey. However, classes are also offered in California and Florida. Workshops involve Brown&#x27;s versions of Plains Indian ceremonies, including the sweat lodge and vision quest.

==Personal life and death==
In July 1977 Tom Brown Jr. married Judy Duck Ford, 33. At the time Judy had a daughter Kerry, 15, and a son Paul, 11, from a previous marriage. The two had one child, Tom Brown III, together. Brown later married Debbie Brown and had two children with her, Coty Tracker Brown and River Scout Brown. Later, Brown married his third wife, Celeste Brown.

Brown died in Neptune, New Jersey, on August 16, 2024, at the age of 74.

==Publications and media==
Brown has written 18 books. His first book &quot;The Tracker&quot;, in 1978, chronicled his coming of age. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; printed a condensed version of the story and provided information about Brown&#x27;s new Tracker School. Tom Brown&#x27;s books are published by Penguin Books:

<text>Davis Dam is a dam on the Colorado River about downstream from Hoover Dam. It stretches across the border between Arizona and Nevada. Originally called Bullhead Dam, Davis Dam was renamed after Arthur Powell Davis, who was the director of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation from 1914 to 1923. The United States Bureau of Reclamation owns and operates the dam, which was completed in 1951.

Davis Dam impounds the Colorado River and forms Lake Mohave.

==Description==

;Davis Dam
Davis Dam is a zoned earth-fill dam with a concrete spillway, in length at the crest, and high. The earth fill dam begins on the Nevada side, but it does not extend to the Arizona side on the east. Instead, there is an inlet formed by earth and concrete, that includes the spillway. The hydroelectric power plant is beside the inlet.

The dam&#x27;s purpose is to re-regulate releases from Hoover Dam upstream, and facilitate the delivery of Colorado River water to Mexico. Bullhead City, Arizona, and Laughlin, Nevada, are located just below the dam along the river. Davis Camp is also nearby, operated as a park by Mohave County. Bullhead City was originally a construction town for workers building the dam.

A road is located on the crest of the earth fill portion of the dam and a Forebay Bridge spans the Forebay. It was formerly part of Arizona State Route 68 to Nevada. In April 2004, the roadway was shut down to vehicle traffic. Pedestrian and bicycle traffic are permitted. The old roadway is now an extension of the Heritage Trail system. Barriers have been placed on the former road at each end of the earthen dam. The facility is heavily patrolled by security forces who strictly enforce parking regulations.

;Davis Dam Hydroelectric Power Plant
The Davis Dam Power Plant is a hydroelectric power plant located on the Arizona side of the dam, beside the inlet. The hydroelectric plant generates between 1 and 2 terawatt-hours of electricity annually. The plant has a capacity of and the tops of its five Francis turbines are visible from outside the plant. The plant&#x27;s head is .

<doc id="1247250" wikidata="Q17013601" url="?curid=1247250" title="Childhood development of fine motor skills">
<text>Fine motor skills are the coordination of small muscle movements which occur e.g., in the fingers, usually in coordination with the eyes. In application to motor skills of hands (and fingers) the term dexterity is commonly used. 
The abilities which involve the use of hands develop over time, starting with primitive gestures such as grabbing at objects to more precise activities that involve precise eye–hand coordination. Fine motor skills are skills that involve a refined use of the small muscles controlling the hand, fingers, and thumb. The development of these skills allows one to be able to complete tasks such as writing, drawing, and buttoning.

According to the results of a study conducted in the USA assessing the difference in foundational motor skills between males and females between the age of five and six years old, there was no significant difference between gender. However, the results displayed a difference in the ability to catch and aim between the six-year-old males and females. The study&#x27;s results proposed that these gender differences are not concrete when adding age as an observing factor.

Young children&#x27;s lives consistent with visual and performing arts that hold as much importance as language and play (Child Development Division, &amp; California Department of Education. 2011, p. 40). &quot;The arts build skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking; they bring parallel opportunities for the development of language/communication, mathematics, and the development of social and interpersonal skills. The following activities are often referred to as children&#x27;s play: scribbling with a crayon, pretending to be a pirate or a bird, humming bits of a tune, banging on a drum, or swaying to music&quot;.

==Self-care skills==
As children refine their motor skills, they are able to help themselves by completing daily activities independently. For example, children between the ages of 2 and 3 are able to put on and take off simplistic articles of clothing. They are able to manipulate clothing with zippers, use spoons, string together beads with large holes, and open doors with doorknobs. When children are between the ages of 3 and 4, they are able to manipulate clothing with larger buttons, use scissors to cut paper, and are able to copy simple lined shapes using a pencil. At 4 to 5 years of age, children are able to dress and undress themselves without assistance. They are also able to manipulate a fork, and have gained the dexterity to cut around shapes with a pair of scissors. By age 6, a child is able to cut softer foods with a knife and is able to tie their own shoes. Because all children develop at their own rate, these ages are not exact to when every child will develop these skills.

==Writing skills==
Parental involvement can influence the stage of writing within their child. Parents, who are more involved in their child&#x27;s learning process, will see significant improvements in their child&#x27;s accuracy and clarity. Those children who are exposed to the support of their parents will develop more proficient fine motor skills. This involvement in a child&#x27;s development is a first step towards the concept of parent engagement. Parent engagement is defined as &quot;...parents and teachers sharing a responsibility to help their children learn and meet educational goals. Parent engagement happens when teachers involve parents in school meetings or events, and parents volunteer their support at home and at school. In this way, they make a commitment. Parents commit to prioritizing their child&#x27;s educational goals, and teachers commit to listening and providing a space for collaboration with parents&quot;. According to &quot;... fifty different studies on parental engagement, educational researchers found a connection between family involvement and academic achievement&quot;.

Children who show a better grasp of fine motor skills are known to have better outcomes in academics. According to the results of a study conducted by Wolff, Gunnoe, and Cohen, observing the development of fine motor skills may provide us with an idea of the strength and capability a child obtains to achieve successful motor skills and academic proficiency. Basic fine motor skills that are associated with the predictability of the success of a child&#x27;s development and achievement in their academic and personal life are typically known as &quot;visual-motor integration, fine motor accuracy, visual-spatial perception, kinesthesia, and imitation of postures&quot;.

==Children&#x27;s drawings==
Children&#x27;s drawings also develop as a child ages and refines their fine motor skills. This has been widely studied, especially by Rhoda Kellogg (1898–1987), following children from 2 years to 8 years of age. Her research has found that the artistic gestures of children evolve from basic scribbles to consistent symbols. The first symbols that are formed by children are the circle, the upright cross, the diagonal cross, the rectangle, and other common forms. When the child is 3 years old, they begin to form face shapes and by age 4, humans. At 4 to 5 years old, the child draws a human form with arms and legs, and eventually the child adds a trunk and clothes. Children then evolve to include other pictorials in their art, such as houses, animals and boats, by the age of 5.

===Manipulative materials===
Toys that require a child to manipulate it with their fingers and hands can be categorized as a manipulative. Manipulatives involve coordinating the eye to what the hands are needed to do. They stimulate fine motor development because they require controlled use of hand and finger muscles. Some manipulative toys, such as puzzles, are self-correcting, fitting together in only one specific way. These types of toys only fit together one way and allow children to work until they achieve success. Play-Doh is a manipulative that can help strengthen a child&#x27;s fine motor skills. Dough can be rolled into balls, tooth picks can be used to create designs in the dough, and plastic knives can be used to cut the dough (with supervision).

===Eye-Coordination===

===Positioning===
Another way to assist a child who is having difficulties developing their fine motor skills is to provide the child with proper positioning of their hands and body to accomplish tasks.
As motor skills develop, children&#x27;s hand grip positioning changes as well. Their grip starts off with a palmar supinate grasp. This grasp involves wrapping the entire hand around the implement used in the shape of a fist with the palm facing upwards. Children then progress to a digital pronate grasp, in which they hold the implement with their palm facing downward. The pronate grasp involves using the middle finger and thumb. Children at this stage are able to use their thumb for tactile prehension. This stage can be mastered by the age of 2–4 years old. They then progress to a static tri-posture grasp and then to a dynamic tripod grasp as their fingers and thumb start to play more of a function. Over time, their hands will begin to move closer to the tip of the implement used, allowing for more precise control over movement technique. The refinement in the position in which they hold the writing utensil goes from holding it from the top to the bottom (closer to the tip).

<text>Altares is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo on the Portuguese island of Terceira in the archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 901, in an area of 28.22 km2.

==History==
Situated on relatively flat land with fertile soils, although situated far from major population centres, the region was settled early, sometime before the year 1480. Owing to the severity of the coast, access to this region was obtained from the port of Biscoitos, some east, and from the early settlement along the ravines of Quatro Ribeiras. The clearing and logging that proceeded along the territory, and from the agrarian structure and morphology of the land, settlement must have progressed from east to west, until the parish of Raminho (which was then known as Folhadais) was last to be settled.

Due to the island&#x27;s date of colonization and the progress of settlement along the north, the first occupation occurred around 1460, resulting in the foundation by the end of the 15th century. The fertility of the soils supported the establishment of agriculture and woad commerce (today remembered in the name of the &quot;Canada dos Engenhos&quot;) which helped establish the wealth of many of the Terceirense families. Referring to agriculture in Altares, Gaspar Frutuoso affirmed:
:&quot;Until the Church of São Roque the land is flat, almost half a league from the square, and weak, providing little wheat and much, thin woad, that which has the lowest price among all the others, to have mixed &quot;bagacina&quot;, almost like pumice; pastel costs little to do and less weeding for the land give little grass.&quot;

By the middle of the 15th century, the first important settlers arrived on the island, such as João Valadão, Gonçalo Álvares Pamplona (founder of Arrochela), Manuel Borges da Costa (descendant of João Borges &quot;The Older&quot;, one of the first inhabitants on the island) and João Álvares Homem (relative of Álvaro Martins Homem), founder of the city of Angra. One of João Valadão daughters married Martim Simão (later identified with the toponymy of the parish, for example &quot;Pico de Matias Simão&quot; or &quot;Pico de Martim Simão&quot;).

It is unclear when the settlement was elevated to the status of parish, but it may have occurred before 1480, associated with a reference to a parish priest. The limits of the parish were relatively undefined, but included the northwest of the island, from Fajã (today an uninhabited site below Mata da Serreta and territory in the parish of Serreta) to the locality of Ponta Negra, including a part of Arrochela (today part of Biscoitos).

The centre of the parish, dominated by parochial church, was founded on the margins of the &quot;Ribeira de São Roque&quot;, in the immediate confluence of the &quot;Ribeira das Lajinhas&quot;, an area covered in vegetation and dominated by a large, evergreen bog. The settlement was supported by ravines and natural springs that ran from the mountainous &quot;Serra de Santa Bárbara&quot;, some from the settlement.

==Geography==

The parish is located in the northwestern part of the island, about 19 kilometres from the city of Angra do Heroísmo. It is bounded on the east by the parish of Biscoitos, which belongs to the municipality of Praia da Vitória, on the west by the parish of Raminho, on the north by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the south and southwest by the caldera of the Santa Bárbara volcano and by the parish also called Santa Bárbara.

Altares is located along the northern flanks of the &quot;Serra de Santa Bárbara&quot; massif, extending from the northern and western edges of the caldera of Santa Barbara volcano to the seaside cliffs on the north coast of the island. Topographically, the civil parish is bounded on the east by the course of the &quot;Ribeira do Pamplona&quot; (&quot;Pamplona Ravine&quot;), which also serves as the border to the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo, and on the west by a line drawn from the summit of &quot;Pico Rachado&quot; to the sea. This line follows the course of the &quot;Ribeira dos Gatos&quot; (&quot;Ravine of the Cats&quot;), but then it diverts to the west to include the hamlet of &quot;Cerro da Ribeira dos Gatos&quot;, a ridge of hills and miscellaneous buildings.

The territory of the parish rises gradually from the coast, first as a relatively gentle slope, but at an increasingly rugged grade as one approaches the heights of the Serra de Santa Bárbara, where five streams have their sources: the &quot;Riberia dos Gatos&quot;, the &quot;Ribeira de São Roque&quot;, the &quot;Ribeira das Lajinhas&quot;, the &quot;Ribeira da Lapa&quot;, and the &quot;Ribeira do Pamplona&quot;. Although crossed by various river courses, the parish is actually poor in hydrographic resources, since surface water is intermittent. In fact, ravine water is primarily from intense precipitation in the foothills, lasting a short time normally. This was not the case during the period of early colonization, since the forest and tuber vegetation would regulate waterflow, resulting in light continuously flowing streams throughout the year. From east to west, the following ravines are the primarily affluent in the parish:
* &quot;Ribeira do Pamplona&quot;, apart from delimiting the parish, it is also the frontier of Angra do Heroísmo;
* &quot;Ribeira de Lapa&quot;, one of the more intensely flowing watercourses;
* &quot;Ribeira da Luz&quot;;
* &quot;Ribeira de São Roque&quot;, alongside the parochial church (in the centre of the parish), and to its left the &quot;Ribeira das Lajinhas&quot;;
* &quot;Ribeira dos Gatos&quot;

==Architecture==

===Religious===
For many years after settlement, small nuclei coalesced around the roadways parallel the coast dominated by chapels and hermitages, transforming into centre of the religious cults: the Hermitage of Santa Catarina of the Pamplona family (constructed in 1525) centre of the locality of Arrochela; the Hermitage of São Mateus situated in Outeiro de São Mateus and pilgrim church during the 16th century, a hermitage erected in 1530, by Margarida Valadão, daughter of João Valadão); the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Luz, situated in Achadas, along the margins of &quot;Ribeira da Luz&quot; (where today stands a Marian niche), that pertained to the Pereira family of Faial, who hand lands here; and the Hermitage of Mãe de Deus, in Folhadais, today the parochial Church of São Francisco Xavier of Raminho. Most of these hermitages have since been abandoned and disappeared from the landscape, although (in 1843), Jerónimo Emiliano de Andrade affirmed the existence of many of the hermitages.

Today these religious structures have been classified as national patrimony:
* Church of São Roque (), the parochial single-nave church, dedicated to Saint Roch, was completed in the 15th century, and is located on an elevated terrain occupied along with the parochial school, &quot;Museu Etnográfico dos Altares&quot;, with an important collection of instruments associated with agriculture and traditional Azorean activities (including exhibition of flora, fauna and ecologia of Terceira).
* Império of the Holy Spirit of Altares (), dating to the early 20th century, the single-room rectangular building is used the festivals associated the Cult of the Holy Spirit held annually by the Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit; it is a highly decorated facade with three gothic-style windows and door, and triangular frontispiece, but also includes annex when the events of the festivals extends.

<text>Lawrence Andrew &quot;Drew&quot; Hayes (July 20, 1969 – March 21, 2007) was a writer and comic book artist who is best known as the creator of the long-running independent comic book series &quot;Poison Elves&quot;.

== Biography ==
Hayes&#x27; early influences included &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Elfquest&quot;, and &quot;Cerebus&quot;.

Hayes began self-publishing &quot;I, Lusiphur&quot; under the Mulehide Graphics imprint in 1991. He changed the series title to &quot;Poison Elves&quot; with issue #8 (Feb 1993), and continued through issue #20 (Feb 1995). During this period, he was a prominent example of creators distributing their black-and-white comics to the direct market. 

In 1995, Hayes brought &quot;Poison Elves&quot; to Sirius Entertainment; and, in 2000, according to Sirius publisher Robb Horan, Hayes &quot;signed a long-term agreement for the property that was specifically intended to allow for an expanding universe and an unhindered continuation of the relationship under any circumstances.&quot; With Sirius, Hayes produced another 79 issues of &quot;Poison Elves&quot; and a color special, the last of which was published in September 2004. During this time, Hayes engaged in an ongoing mock &quot;feud&quot; with fellow comics creator Brian Bendis in the letters pages of their books. Sirius published twelve &quot;Poison Elves&quot; paperbacks, as well as a number of &quot;Poison Elves&quot; short series and one-shots, most of which were produced by other creative teams.

=== Death ===
Hayes suffered from health problems which hampered his ability to create comics. He was overweight, had suffered cardiac damage from sleep apnea, and had been hospitalized more than once. After undergoing treatment in the hospital and losing weight, he planned to resume creating new issues of &quot;Poison Elves&quot;, but died at the age of 37, of a heart attack while suffering from pneumonia.

<doc id="1247255" wikidata="Q2935197" url="?curid=1247255" title="Dazzle camouflage">
<text>Dazzle camouflage, also known as razzle dazzle (in the U.S.) or dazzle painting, is a type of ship camouflage that was used extensively in World War I, and to a lesser extent in World War II and afterwards. Credited to the British marine artist Norman Wilkinson, though with a rejected prior claim by the zoologist John Graham Kerr, it consisted of complex patterns of geometric shapes in contrasting colours interrupting and intersecting each other.

Unlike other forms of camouflage, the intention of dazzle is not to conceal but to make it difficult to estimate a target&#x27;s range, speed, and heading. Norman Wilkinson explained in 1919 that he had intended dazzle primarily to mislead the enemy about a ship&#x27;s course and so cause them to take up a poor firing position.

Dazzle was adopted by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy. Each ship&#x27;s dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships instantly recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was, at best, mixed. So many factors were involved that it was impossible to determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective. Experiments were carried out on aircraft in both World Wars with little success.

Dazzle attracted the notice of artists such as Picasso, who claimed that Cubists like himself had invented it. Edward Wadsworth, who supervised the camouflaging of over 2,000 ships during the First World War, painted a series of canvases of dazzle ships after the war, based on his wartime work. Arthur Lismer similarly painted a series of dazzle ship canvases.

==Intended purposes==
At first glance, dazzle seems an unlikely form of camouflage, drawing attention to the ship rather than hiding it. The approach was developed after Allied navies were unable to develop effective means to hide ships in all weather conditions. The British zoologist John Graham Kerr proposed the application of camouflage to British warships in the First World War, outlining what he believed to be the applicable principle, disruptive camouflage, in a letter to Winston Churchill in 1914 explaining the goal was to confuse, not to conceal, by disrupting a ship&#x27;s outline. Kerr compared the effect to that created by the patterns on a series of land animals, the giraffe, zebra and jaguar.

Taking up the zebra example, Kerr proposed that the vertical lines of ships&#x27; masts be disrupted with irregular white bands. Hiding these would make ships less conspicuous, and would &quot;greatly increase the difficulty of accurate range finding&quot;. However, in the same letter, Kerr also called for countershading, the use of paint to obliterate self-shading and thus to flatten out the appearance of solid, recognisable shapes. For example, he proposed painting ships&#x27; guns grey on top, grading to white below, so the guns would disappear against a grey background.

Similarly, he advised painting shaded parts of the ship white, and brightly lit parts in grey, again with smooth grading between them, making shapes and structures invisible. Kerr was thus hoping to achieve both a measure of invisibility and a degree of confusion for the enemy using a rangefinder. Whether through this mixing of goals, or the Admiralty&#x27;s scepticism about &quot;any theory based upon the analogy of animals&quot;, the Admiralty claimed in July 1915 to have conducted &quot;various trials&quot; and decided to paint its ships in monotone grey, not adopting any of Kerr&#x27;s suggestions. It had made up its mind, and all Kerr&#x27;s subsequent letters achieved nothing.

The American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer had developed a theory of camouflage based on countershading and disruptive coloration, which he had published in the controversial 1909 book &quot;Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom&quot;. Seeing the opportunity to put his theory into service, Thayer wrote to Churchill in February 1915, proposing to camouflage submarines by countershading them like fish such as mackerel, and advocating painting ships white to make them invisible. His ideas were considered by the Admiralty, but rejected along with Kerr&#x27;s proposals as being &quot;freak methods of painting ships ... of academic interest but not of practical advantage&quot;. 

The Admiralty noted that the required camouflage would vary depending on the light, the changing colours of sea and sky, the time of day, and the angle of the sun. Thayer made repeated and desperate efforts to persuade the authorities, and in November 1915 travelled to England where he gave demonstrations of his theory around the country. He had a warm welcome from Kerr in Glasgow, and was so enthused by this show of support that he avoided meeting the War Office, who he had been intending to win over, and instead sailed home, continuing to write ineffective letters to the British and American authorities.

The marine artist and Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle&#x27;s aim was confusion rather than concealment, but disagreed about the type of confusion to be sown in the enemy&#x27;s mind. What Wilkinson wanted to do was to make it difficult for an enemy to estimate a ship&#x27;s type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer&#x27;s position.

Wilkinson advocated &quot;masses of strongly contrasted colour&quot; to confuse the enemy about a ship&#x27;s heading. Thus, while dazzle, in some lighting conditions or at close ranges, might actually increase a ship&#x27;s visibility, the conspicuous patterns would obscure the outlines of the ship&#x27;s hull (though admittedly not the superstructure), disguising the ship&#x27;s correct heading and making it harder to hit.

Dazzle was created in response to an extreme need, and hosted by an organisation, the Admiralty, which had already rejected an approach supported by scientific theory: Kerr&#x27;s proposal to use &quot;parti-colouring&quot; based on the known camouflage methods of disruptive coloration and countershading. This was dropped in favour of an admittedly non-scientific approach, led by the socially well-connected Wilkinson. Kerr&#x27;s explanations of the principles were clear, logical, and based on years of study, while Wilkinson&#x27;s were simple and inspirational, based on an artist&#x27;s perception. The decision was likely because the Admiralty felt comfortable with Wilkinson, in sharp contrast to their awkward relationship with the stubborn and pedantic Kerr.

Wilkinson claimed not to have known of the zoological theories of camouflage of Kerr and Thayer, admitting only to having heard of the &quot;old invisibility-idea&quot; from Roman times.

==Possible mechanisms==
===Disrupting rangefinding===

In 1973, the naval museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) suggested a mechanism by which dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to make it difficult for an enemy to estimate the ship&#x27;s speed.

===Disguising heading and speed===
The historian Sam Willis argued that since Wilkinson knew it was impossible to make a ship invisible with paint, the &quot;extreme opposite&quot; was the answer, using conspicuous shapes and violent colour contrasts to confuse enemy submarine commanders. Willis pointed out, using the dazzle scheme as an example, that different mechanisms could have been at work. The contradictory patterns on the ship&#x27;s funnels could imply the ship was on a different heading (as Wilkinson had said). The curve on the hull below the front funnel could seem to be a false bow wave, creating a misleading impression of the ship&#x27;s speed; additionally, the striped patterns on the bow and stern could create confusion about which end of the ship was which.

That dazzle did indeed work along these lines is suggested by the testimony of a U-boat captain:

===Motion dazzle===

In 2011, the scientist Nicholas E. Scott-Samuel and colleagues presented evidence using moving patterns on a computer that human perception of speed is distorted by dazzle patterns. However, the speeds required for motion dazzle are much larger than were available to First World War ships: Scott-Samuel notes that the targets in the experiment would correspond to a dazzle-patterned Land Rover vehicle at a range of , travelling at . If such a dazzling target causes a 7% confusion in the observed speed, a rocket propelled grenade travelling that distance in half a second would strike from the intended aiming point, or 7% of the distance moved by the target. This might be enough to save lives in the dazzle-patterned vehicle, and perhaps to cause the missile to miss entirely.

==World War I==

===British Royal Navy===

In 1914, Kerr persuaded the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to adopt a form of military camouflage which he called &quot;parti-colouring&quot;. He argued both for countershading (following the American artist Abbott Thayer), and for disruptive coloration, both as used by animals. A general order to the British fleet issued on 10 November 1914 advocated use of Kerr&#x27;s approach. It was applied in various ways to British warships such as , where officers noted approvingly that the pattern &quot;increased difficulty of accurate range finding&quot;. However, following Churchill&#x27;s departure from the Admiralty, the Royal Navy reverted to plain grey paint schemes, informing Kerr in July 1915 that &quot;various trials had been undertaken and that the range of conditions of light and surroundings rendered it necessary to modify considerably any theory based upon the analogy of [the colours and patterns of] animals&quot;.


The British Army inaugurated its Camouflage Section for land use at the end of 1916. At sea in 1917, heavy losses of merchant ships to Germany&#x27;s unrestricted submarine warfare campaign led to new desire for camouflage. The marine painter Norman Wilkinson promoted a system of stripes and broken lines &quot;to distort the external shape by violent colour contrasts&quot; and confuse the enemy about the speed and dimensions of a ship. 

Wilkinson, then a lieutenant commander on Royal Navy patrol duty, implemented the precursor of &quot;dazzle&quot; beginning with the merchantman SS &quot;Industry&quot;. Wilkinson was put in charge of a camouflage unit which used the technique on large groups of merchant ships. Over 4000 British merchant ships were painted in what came to be known as &quot;dazzle camouflage&quot;; dazzle was also applied to some 400 naval vessels, starting in August 1917.

All British patterns were different, first tested on small wooden models viewed through a periscope in a studio. Most of the model designs were painted by women from London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Arts. A foreman then scaled up their designs for the real thing. Painters, however, were not alone in the project. Creative people including sculptors, artists, and set designers designed camouflage.

Wilkinson&#x27;s dazzle camouflage was accepted by the Admiralty, even without practical visual assessment protocols for improving performance by modifying designs and colours. The dazzle camouflage strategy was adopted by other navies. This led to more scientific studies of colour options which might enhance camouflage effectiveness.

After the war, starting on 27 October 1919, an Admiralty committee met to determine who had priority for the invention of dazzle. Kerr was asked whether he thought Wilkinson had personally benefited from anything that he, Kerr, had written. Kerr avoided the question, implying that he had not, and said &quot;I make no claim to have invented the principle of parti-colouring, this principle was, of course, invented by nature&quot;. He agreed also that he had not suggested anywhere in his letters that his system would &quot;create an illusion as to the course of the vessel painted&quot;. In October 1920 the Admiralty told Kerr that he was not seen as responsible for dazzle painting. In 1922 Wilkinson was awarded the sum of £2000 for the invention.

===Royal Flying Corps===
In the First World War, experiments were conducted on British aircraft such as the Royal Flying Corps&#x27; Sopwith Camels to make their angle and direction difficult to judge for an enemy gunner. Similarly the Royal Navy painted some of their Felixstowe flying boats with bold disrupting lines similar to those of their ship camouflage. The effect remained dubious, but was found to reduce the incidence of the planes being targeted by anti-aircraft gunners on their own side.

===Effectiveness===

Dazzle&#x27;s effectiveness was highly uncertain at the time of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. Dazzle ships had been attacked in 1.47% of sailings, compared to 1.12% for uncamouflaged ships, suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, dazzle was not attempting to make ships hard to see. Suggestively, of the ships that were struck by torpedoes, 43% of the dazzle ships sank, compared to 54% of the uncamouflaged.

Similarly, 41% of the dazzle ships were struck amidships, compared to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons could be taken to imply that submarine commanders had more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading and where to aim. Furthermore, the ships painted in dazzle were larger than the uncamouflaged ships, 38% of them being over 5000 tons compared to only 13% of uncamouflaged ships, making comparisons unreliable.

With hindsight, too many factors (choice of colour scheme; size and speed of ships; tactics used) had been varied for it to be possible to determine which factors were significant or which schemes worked best. Thayer did carry out an experiment on dazzle camouflage, but it failed to show any reliable advantage over plain paintwork.

The American data were analysed by Harold Van Buskirk in 1919. About 1,256 ships were painted in dazzle between 1 March 1918 and the end of the war on 11 November that year. Among American merchantmen 2,500 tons and over, 78 uncamouflaged ships were sunk, and only 18 camouflaged ships; out of these 18, 11 were sunk by torpedoes, 4 in collisions and 3 by mines. No US Navy ships (all camouflaged) were sunk in the period.

==World War II==

===Ships===

However effective dazzle camouflage may have been in World War I, it became less useful as rangefinders and especially aircraft became more advanced, and, by the time it was put to use again in World War II, radar further reduced its effectiveness. However, it may still have confounded enemy submarines.

In the Royal Navy, dazzle paint schemes reappeared in January 1940. These were unofficial, and competitions were often held between ships for the best camouflage patterns. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Camouflage Department came up with a scheme devised by a young naval officer, Peter Scott, a wildlife artist, which were developed into the &quot;Western Approaches Schemes&quot;. In 1942 the &quot;Admiralty Intermediate Disruptive Pattern&quot; came into use, followed in 1944 by the &quot;Admiralty Standard Schemes&quot;. Dazzle patterns were tested on small model ships at the Royal Navy&#x27;s Directorate of Camouflage in Leamington Spa; these were painted and then viewed in a shallow tank on the building&#x27;s roof.

The United States Navy implemented a camouflage painting program in World War II, and applied it to many ship classes, from patrol craft and auxiliaries to battleships and some s. The designs (known as Measures, each identified with a number) were not arbitrary, but were standardised in a process which involved a planning stage, then a review, and then fleet-wide implementation. 

Not all United States Navy measures involved dazzle patterns; some were simple or even totally unsophisticated, such as a false bow wave on traditional Haze Gray, or Deck Blue replacing grey over part or all of the ship (the latter to counter the kamikaze threat). Dazzle measures were used until 1945; in February 1945 the United States Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet decided to repaint its ships in non-dazzle measures against the kamikaze threat, while the Atlantic Fleet continued to use dazzle, ships being repainted if transferred to the Pacific.

Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; first used camouflage in the 1940 Norwegian campaign. A wide range of patterns were authorised, but most commonly black and white diagonal stripes were used. Most patterns were designed to hide ships in harbour or near the coast; they were often painted over with plain grey when operating in the Atlantic.

===Aircraft===
In 1940, the US Navy conducted experiments with dazzle-type camouflage for aircraft. The artist McClelland Barclay designed &quot;pattern camouflage&quot; schemes for US Navy aircraft such as the Douglas TBD Devastator and the Brewster F2A Buffalo to make it difficult for the enemy to gauge the shape and position of the aircraft. The camouflaged aircraft were flown in combat, but the effect was found not to be satisfactory.

==Since World War II==

=== Renewed naval use ===
In 2019, the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS &quot;Regina&quot; was painted in a 1944 pattern to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic; the pattern was described variously as &quot;dazzle&quot; and &quot;disruptive&quot;. In 2021, the Royal Navy painted HMS &quot;Tamar&quot;, a , in patches of black and four shades of grey. It described this as &quot;dazzle camouflage&quot;, making the ship the first Royal Navy vessel to have such a paint scheme since the Second World War. It stated that the scheme was &quot;more about supporting the unique identity of the squadron&quot; than for concealment. and most recently has been painted in this Dazzle Camouflage.

For concealment purposes, the United States Navy littoral combat ship USS &quot;Freedom&quot; used the &quot;Measure 32&quot; paint scheme during a deployment to Singapore in 2013. It was also reported that during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Navy painted &quot;dark stripes on its warships to make them look smaller and confuse Ukrainian drones&quot;.

=== Arts ===
The abstract patterns in dazzle camouflage inspired artists including Picasso. He claimed credit for camouflage experiments, which seemed to him a quintessentially Cubist technique. In a conversation with Gertrude Stein shortly after he first saw a painted cannon trundling through the streets of Paris he remarked, &quot;Yes it is we who made it, that is cubism&quot;. In Britain, Edward Wadsworth, who supervised dazzle camouflage painting in the war, created a series of canvases after the war based on his dazzle work on ships. His work later inspired Peter Saville&#x27;s cover and the title of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Dazzle Ships&quot;. In Canada, Arthur Lismer used dazzle ships in some of his wartime compositions. In America, Burnell Poole painted canvases of United States Navy ships in dazzle camouflage at sea. The historian of camouflage Peter Forbes comments that the ships had a Modernist look, their designs succeeding as avant-garde or Vorticist art.

In 2007, the art of camouflage, including the evolution of dazzle, was featured as the theme for a show at the Imperial War Museum. In 2009, the Fleet Library at the Rhode Island School of Design exhibited its rediscovered collection of lithographic printed plans for the camouflage of American World War I merchant ships, in an exhibition titled &quot;Bedazzled&quot;.

In 2013, Phil Coy was commissioned to design the facade of Lewisham&#x27;s Glass Mill leisure centre in South East London. His design &quot;Razzle Dazzle Boogie Woogie&quot; collapses the principles of Dazzle camouflage with those of Piet Mondrian&#x27;s seminal painting Broadway Boogie Woogie into a digital camouflage design that covers the buildings facade. 

In 2014, the Centenary Art Commission backed three dazzle camouflage installations in Britain: Carlos Cruz-Diez covered the pilot ship in Liverpool&#x27;s Canning Dock with bright multi-coloured dazzle artwork, as part of the city&#x27;s 2014 Liverpool Biennial art festival; and Tobias Rehberger painted , anchored since 1922 at Blackfriars Bridge in London, to commemorate the use of dazzle, a century on. Peter Blake was commissioned to design exterior paintwork for , a Mersey Ferry, which he called &quot;Everybody Razzle Dazzle&quot;, combining his trademark motifs (stars, targets etc.) with First World War dazzle designs.


===Other uses===

In civilian life, patterns reminiscent of dazzle camouflage are sometimes used to mask a test car during trials, to make determining its exterior design difficult. During the 2015 Formula 1 testing period, the Red Bull RB11 car was painted in a scheme intended to confound rival teams&#x27; ability to analyse its aerodynamics. 

The designer Adam Harvey has similarly proposed a form of camouflage reminiscent of dazzle for personal camouflage from face-detection technology, which he calls computer vision dazzle. Its intention is to block detection by facial recognition technologies such as DeepFace &quot;by creating an &#x27;anti-face. It uses occlusion, covering certain facial features; transformation, altering the shape or colour of parts of the face; and a combination of the two.

The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has used dazzle patterns on its fleet since 2009 for recognition rather than camouflage.

English football team Manchester United used a football kit during the 2020–21 season that resembled a dazzle design.

<text>Sender Zehlendorf or Zehlendorf (radio) transmission facility was a radio transmission facility which was in service since 1936, when a short wave transmitter was built on the occasion of the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics in Zehlendorf (a village near Oranienburg) as part of the establishment of permanent radio services. This Zehlendorf site, which until the end of World War II was referred to as the Rehmate Radio Transmission Centre (), had 26 different antennas at the time (that is, before and at the end of World War II).

In 2017 the last antenna at the site was demolished by controlled implosion, ending the era of the transmission towers in Zehlendorf.

==History==

In 1945, most of the Rehmate Radio Transmission Centre was dismantled by the Soviet occupying forces as reparation, who left only three wooden radio masts. Two of these wooden masts supplied the building material for a 100-metre-tall transmission tower built at Golm in 1948, which was used until 1979.

In 1952 it was decided to build at the location of the former radio transmission center Rehmate the central long wave transmitter of the GDR. For this between 1956 and 1958 a triangle plane aerial, which was hung up on three 150 metres high guyed masts of lattice steel, which were insulated against ground, was built. A second transmitting antenna, which would become the main antenna, was built between 1960 and 1962. It consisted of a , lattice steel framework mast, at which a conical cage aerial was mounted, making it the tallest structure in Europe between 1962 and 1964. With this antenna a transmitting power of 750 kilowatts in the long-wave range on a frequency, which was reduced in course of the time gradually for the reduction by interference from 185 kHz to 177 kHz, was possible. The maximum transmitting power, which was possible over the triangle plane aerial, was 500 kilowatts.

On 18 May 1978 the main mast collapsed after being struck by a Russian airplane of the type Mig-21. After the cause of the collapse was certain, the Soviet Union promised to supply a new mast and to rebuild the mast. In order not to stop the progress of the construction work by the stricter German safety regulations, for the duration of the construction work the area in the radius of 300 metres was explained as Soviet exclave. In August 1979 the new mast with a height of 359.7 metres was finished.

In 1990 the plant was taken over by the Deutsche Telekom AG. At first it was planned to shut down the facility: so the cage aerial at the main mast was dismantled and the transmitting power of the long wave transmitter was reduced occasionally to 100 kilowatts. In the second half of the 1990s a reorientation occurred. The long wave transmitter was modernized and the main antenna tower received a new cage aerial. Also the transmitting power of the long wave transmitter was increased again to 500 kW. In the year 2000 a , guyed, grounded mast of lattice steel carrying a cage aerial for medium wave was built. This took over the function of the former Transmitter Berlin-Koepenick and served apart from the spreading of the program of MEGARADIO also for transmitting of programs of the Voice of Russia, partly in the Simulcast mode.

The long wave transmitter changed over on 29 August 2005 as first German large transmitter to Digital Radio Mondiale. The long wave transmitter ceased operation on December 31, 2014 as part of the general shutdown in Germany of AM radio services to the public. The mast continued to support VHF radio antennas providing FM broadcast services.

The triangle plane antenna masts (3 of them, 150 meters high each) were demolished in 2007, with the antenna itself having been taken out of service in 2003.

In 2015, the 129-meter mast was demolished; transmission from it had ceased in 2014.

The last mast (the highest, main mast of 359.7 meters height) at the site was demolished in 2017, and radio operations at the site ended.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-9 (; USAF/DoD designation: Type 8) was an early jet fighter built in the Soviet Union shortly after World War II. The design began in 1944 and was intended to use Soviet-designed turbojet engines. The design was heavily influenced by captured German jet fighters and it was subsequently redesigned to use a Soviet copy of a German turbojet. The Su-9 was slower than competing Soviet aircraft and it was cancelled as a result. A modified version with different engines and a revised wing became the Su-11 (&quot;Samolyot KL&quot;), but this did not enter production either. The Su-13 (&quot;Samolyot KT&quot;) was a proposal to re-engine the aircraft with Soviet copies of the Rolls-Royce Derwent turbojet as well as to modify it for night fighting, but neither proposal was accepted.

==Design and development==
===Su-9===

In 1944, the Sukhoi design bureau (OKB) began designing a twin-engined fighter powered by two Lyulka TR-1 turbojets, known internally as the Samolyet or Izdeliye (item or product) K. The ultimate design was very probably influenced by a captured Messerschmitt Me 262, but the Su-9 was not a copy of the German aircraft. The Su-9 had an oval cross-section, all-metal stressed skin monocoque fuselage that housed a single cockpit. The pilot was protected by armor plates to his front, an armored seat back and a bulletproof windscreen for the bubble canopy. He was provided with an ejection seat, copied from that used in the Heinkel He 162. The aircraft carried a total of of fuel in two bladder tanks, one each ahead and behind the pilot. The low-mounted, straight wing had a single-spar and a slight dihedral of 4°20&#x27;. The outer flaps were split and could act as air brakes. The Su-9 was the first Soviet aircraft to use hydraulic-powered controls. A Soviet copy of the Junkers Jumo 004B turbojet, known as the RD-10, was hung under each wing in a streamlined nacelle. The aircraft had a tricycle undercarriage that retracted into the fuselage. The Su-9 was designed with a very high wing loading which increased the aircraft&#x27;s speed and reduced its dimensions. This consequently increased the take-off and landing speeds so it was equipped with a provision for two JATO bottles (11.27 kN (530 lbf) thrust for 8 seconds) mounted on the sides of the fuselage. These reduced the take-off distance by nearly 50 percent and a braking parachute was fitted to reduce the landing distance.

The nose housed the armament of one Nudelman N-37 autocannon and two Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon. The N-37 could be replaced by a Nudelman-Suranov NS-45. The aircraft carried 100 rounds for each NS-23 and 40 rounds for the N-37. Two FAB-250 high explosive bombs could be carried underneath the forward fuselage, but the N-37 had to be dismounted to do so.

As the TR-1 engines originally intended for the Su-9 were not yet ready for flight testing in late 1945, Pavel Sukhoi suggested substituting a pair of Jumo 004 engines and this was approved on 15 December. The full-scale mockup was found to be acceptable on 16 February 1946 and the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars issued an order on 26 February that the manufacturer&#x27;s flight testing was to begin on 1 November. This goal was not met because the OKB was heavily committed to other projects like the trainer version of the Tupolev Tu-2 bomber, inexperience with JATO units, and late delivery of RD-10 engines. The first prototype was completed in mid-October and made its first flight on 13 November. The test pilots found the aircraft easy to fly, but the control forces were very high at speed and it lacked enough directional stability. Enlarging the vertical stabilizer cured this last problem and hydraulic boosters were fitted for the control system.

The aircraft was revealed to the general public on 3 August 1947 at a flypast at Moscow&#x27;s Tushino Airfield and the aircraft began its state acceptance trials three days later. Flight testing was completed by 25 May 1948 after 136 flights had been completed. It demonstrated a top speed of at an altitude of and an endurance of one hour and 44 minutes. It had very docile handling qualities with one engine inoperative. The aircraft was recommended for production, but it was significantly slower than the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 and Yakovlev Yak-15. The government declined to do so and the program was terminated.

A two-seat trainer version, the Su-9UT, was planned during 1946, but it too was cancelled. The cockpit for the student would have been positioned ahead of the instructor&#x27;s cockpit and each would have had a separate canopy. The armament would have been reduced to a pair of Berezin B-20 autocannon, each with a hundred rounds of ammunition. The armor would have been removed to save weight.

===Su-11===

Another prototype was begun in 1946, but this aircraft was intended to use the Yakovlev-designed version of the afterburning RD-10F engine. However, wind tunnel testing of the Su-9 in September revealed that drag could be reduced if the engine nacelles were mounted in the wing rather than underneath it, and the wing tips were redesigned to use a different airfoil that significantly reduced Mach tuck. These changes required that the entire wing be redesigned; the wing spar was bent into an inverted U to accommodate the engines and slotted flaps replaced the simple flaps previously used. The tailplane was given a 5° dihedral to move it out of the engine exhaust. 

Before the prototype was finished, Sukhoi was ordered to use the Lyulka TR-1 turbojets originally intended for the Su-9. This aircraft was designated the Su-11 and was called Samolyet KL by the OKB. Each TR-1 developed only 12.7 kN (2,865 lbf) thrust each, rather than the 15 kN (3300 lbf) required. The aircraft made its first flight on 28 May 1947 and also participated in the flypast at Tushino in August. It had a maximum speed of at sea level, but flight testing revealed that it lacked longitudinal stability at high speeds. Modifications of the wing/nacelle fillets and lengthening the engine nacelles failed to cure these problems. Coupled with the unavailability of mature TR-1 engines, these problems caused the program to be cancelled.

===Su-13===
The Su-13, (&quot;Samolyet KT&quot;), was the final attempt to further increase performance of the basic Su-9 design, using wing sections reduced from 11% to 9% thickness/chord ratio and swept tailplanes. The aircraft was also fitted with a pair of Klimov RD-500 (unlicensed copies of the Rolls-Royce Derwent) engines with 15.6 kN (3,500 lbf) thrust each. The armament was changed to three 37 mm Nudelman N-37 cannon, while drop tanks could be fitted underneath the wingtips. A night fighter version with a &quot;Torii&quot; radar was also proposed, but this required major structural changes to accommodate the radar. Neither version made it off the drawing board.

<text>In mathematics (particularly multivariable calculus), a volume integral (∭) is an integral over a 3-dimensional domain; that is, it is a special case of multiple integrals. Volume integrals are especially important in physics for many applications, for example, to calculate flux densities, or to calculate mass from a corresponding density function.

==In coordinates==
It can also mean a triple integral within a region formula_1 of a function formula_2 and is usually written as:
formula_3

A volume integral in cylindrical coordinates is
formula_4
and a volume integral in spherical coordinates (using the ISO convention for angles with formula_5 as the azimuth and formula_6 measured from the polar axis (see more on conventions)) has the form
formula_7

== Example ==

Integrating the equation formula_8 over a unit cube yields the following result:
formula_9

So the volume of the unit cube is 1 as expected. This is rather trivial however, and a volume integral is far more powerful. For instance if we have a scalar density function on the unit cube then the volume integral will give the total mass of the cube. For example for density function:
formula_10 
the total mass of the cube is: 
formula_11

<text>John Terry Norum (born 23 February 1964) is a Norwegian-Swedish guitarist and one of the founders of the rock band Europe. Concurrent to his role with Europe, he also maintains a career as a solo artist.

==Biography==
As an infant, Norum moved with his parents to Upplands Väsby (a Stockholm suburb), where he grew up and has spent most of his life.

During his career in music, Norum has played with Eddie Meduza &amp; the Roaring Cadillacs, Dokken, Don Dokken&#x27;s solo band, as well as collaborated with other well-known artists on his solo albums, including Glenn Hughes, Kelly Keeling, Peter Baltes, Simon Wright and Göran Edman. His influences include Gary Moore, Michael Schenker, Frank Marino, John Sykes and Ritchie Blackmore.

In 1979, John Norum formed Force, which was Europe&#x27;s first name, with vocalist Joey Tempest. Europe participated in and won the &quot;Rock Sm&quot;, Swedish championship of rock, broadcast on television in 1982, with Norum being voted best guitarist and Joey best vocalist. The championship prize was the recording of a studio album by a small Swedish label.

The album &quot;Europe&quot; was released in February 1983, and became a hit in the band&#x27;s home country and in Japan. In February 1984 &quot;Wings of Tomorrow&quot;, the band&#x27;s next album was released, and the band started to become very popular on the Swedish scene, touring throughout the country, and also gaining recognition in Japan. The band signed to Epic Records in 1985 and recorded the album &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; at the end of the year. In May 1986, &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; was released, and quickly achieved success in several European countries, Japan, and United States. A series of disagreements between Norum and the band&#x27;s manager Thomas Erdtman began to occur even before the tour began, which led the guitarist to decide to leave the band in October 1986.

After having left Europe, Norum signed a solo contract for three studio albums with Europe&#x27;s label. His solo debut, &quot;Total Control&quot;, was released in October 1987. Norum sang on almost all of the songs, while Göran Edman sang on the other three. The album was successful in Sweden, getting to No. 4 in the Swedish charts and gaining platinum status (the single &quot;Let Me Love You&quot; also went to No. 4 in the Swedish charts; the ballad &quot;Back on the Streets&quot; to No. 34 &quot;Billboard&quot; US Rock). Norum won all the music awards of the year in the country in 1988. The band toured Sweden. Their last show took place at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, England in late 1988.

Norum&#x27;s talent, evident on albums with Europe and his first solo album, sparked the interest of vocalist Don Dokken of the American band Dokken, who split up in 1988. Norum was enlisted to contribute to the album &quot;Up from the Ashes&quot;, which came out as Don Dokken&#x27;s first solo album in 1990, and they went on tour in 1991. In 1990, Norum released a mini EP live, recorded in 1988, &quot;Live in Stockholm&quot;.

In 1992, the album &quot;Face the Truth&quot; was released. The album was a project with former Deep Purple frontman Glenn Hughes, with Hughes singing practically all of the songs. Joey Tempest also guested on the album.

In 1995, the album &quot;Another Destination&quot; was released, being his last release for Epic Records. He toured behind the album in Sweden with new vocalist, Kelly Keeling, who had also sung on the album. In December 1996, another album, &quot;Worlds Away&quot; released (again with Keeling singing), through a new record company, Mascot Records. The following year, a show in Japan was recorded (with new singer, Leif Sundin), which was released as the &quot;Face It Live&quot; album. At the end of 1997, John Norum performed 15 shows as part of Dokken in the United States, replacing George Lynch who had once again left the band.

In 1999, Norum released his last solo album before his return to Europe, &quot;Slipped into Tomorrow&quot;, with him on vocals. He went on tour in Scandinavia, with Thin Lizzy guitar player Brian Robertson playing songs of that band.

At the turn of the millennium, Norum participated in Europe&#x27;s inaugural concert for Swedish TV, playing with the band again after 14 years of absence. He again joined the band that same year, this time at the Hard Rock Cafe in Stockholm, to play &quot;Rock the Night&quot;.

In 2001, Norum joined Dokken as an official member. They toured the United States in 2001 and in 2002 released the &quot;Long Way Home&quot; album. During a tour of Europe, not satisfied with Don Dokken&#x27;s temperament, he decided to leave the band. In 2003, Europe announced its official reforming of the classic five-man lineup, with Norum officially returning to the band, having not been a member for 17 years. He refused an offer by UFO before rejoining Europe (Norum had already rejected an offer from UFO in 1996, plus Michael Schenker who had left, upon learning of the offer made to Norum, returned to the band).

Since 2004, Europe has released six further studio albums, while Norum released a further sixth and seventh solo album, &quot;Optimus&quot; in 2005, and &quot;Play Yard Blues&quot; in 2010, singing on both albums. His latest solo album &quot;Gone to Stay&quot; was released in 2022.

==Personal life==
Norum started and developed his musical career in Sweden, but has also lived in the United States for a few years, where he met and married Michelle Meldrum, founder and lead guitarist of the all-female hard rock band Phantom Blue and the Swedish metal band Meldrum, in 1995. The couple had one son, Jake Thomas, born on 22 September 2004. On 21 May 2008, Michelle died from a cystic growth in her brain. Another son, Jim Henry, was born on 16 April 2012, to him and his Swedish fiancée Camilla Wåhlander. The couple also had a daughter, Celine Margareta, born on 28 July 2014.

Norum is the older brother of singer Tone Norum. and his stepfather is Thomas Witt, a former record producer, Columbia executive and drummer for Eddie Meduza.

<text>Damoiseau is a lunar impact crater that is located just to the west of the Oceanus Procellarum, in the western part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It lies due east of the prominent crater Grimaldi, a walled plain with a distinctive dark floor. Due south of Damoiseau is the crater Sirsalis.

The low outer rim of Damoiseau is not quite circular, having an outward protrusion to the northeast and smaller bulges to the north and southeast. The interior floor is irregular and complex, with a series of fractures (similar to Vitello). The crater is concentric with a larger, older crater designated Damoiseau M that is approximately twice the diameter. This outer feature is missing a rim to the northeast where it intersects the lunar mare.

To the southeast is a rille system named the Rimae Grimaldi. This continues to the west and south, for a maximum dimension of 230 kilometers.

Damoiseau was formally named by the IAU in 1935. Its satellite craters were named in 2006.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Damoiseau.

<text>Adrian James &quot;A.J.&quot; Croce (born September 28, 1971) is an American singer-songwriter. His parents are Ingrid Croce and Jim Croce.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Croce was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, on September 28, 1971, the son of singers Jim Croce, who was from an Italian Roman Catholic family, and Ingrid Croce, who is Jewish. His father died in a plane crash in September 1973, at age 30, eight days before A.J.&#x27;s second birthday. Shortly before his father&#x27;s death, in the summer of 1973, the family moved to San Diego. When he was four years old, he was temporarily blinded as a result of a brain tumor syndrome. He was hospitalized for six months and was totally blind in both eyes for six years. Croce grew up listening to Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, a lot of soul music, early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, jazz, and blues. He learned how to play the piano, inspired by Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder. He later regained sight in one eye. For junior high, Croce attended Hebrew school. When he was 15, in 1987, the family&#x27;s house burned down.

===Career===
Croce&#x27;s first paying gig was at the age of 12, when he was paid $20 to perform 25–30 minutes of cover versions at a bar mitzvah party. Croce played music for a living from the age of 15. By the age of 16, Croce was performing regularly at San Diego nightclubs as a sideman and band leader.

When he was 17, while staying at the house of Arlo Guthrie, he met Mae Boren Axton, who invited him to Nashville to record with Jack Clement.

Ron Goldstein and Peter Baumann of Private Music signed Croce to his first recording contract, at age 19. He recorded two albums for Private Music: his self-titled debut, &quot;A. J. Croce&quot;, produced by T-Bone Burnett and John Simon; and &quot;That&#x27;s Me in the Bar&quot;, produced by Jim Keltner, and featuring Ry Cooder and David Hidalgo.

Croce&#x27;s third album, &quot;Fit to Serve&quot;, was recorded in 1998 in Memphis and produced by Jim Gaines, who produced Van Morrison, Carlos Santana, and the Steve Miller Band.

Songs on &quot;Transit&quot;, released in 2000, were compared to the works of The Beatles, Elvis Costello, and The Posies.

In 2003, Croce launched his own record label, Seedling Records.

Croce&#x27;s next three albums were self-produced. &quot;Adrian James Croce&quot;, Croce&#x27;s only pop-oriented album, was the only independently produced album of 2004 to chart in the Top 40 in the U.S. The album won Best Pop album at the 2004 San Diego Music Awards. His 2006 album, &quot;Cantos,&quot; on his own label, Seedling Records, features Ben Harper. In 2009, his album &quot;Cage of Muses&quot; was released on Seedling, garnering a 4-star review from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In 2012, he publicly performed an entire set of his father&#x27;s songs for the first time.

In 2013, Croce signed with Compass Records and released &quot;Twelve Tales.&quot; He recorded two songs with each of six producers in five U.S. cities over 12 months, releasing one song per month exclusively on iTunes in 2013. The full album was released in 2014. The album&#x27;s producers were Jack Clement, Allen Toussaint, Mitchell Froom, Kevin Killen, Tony Berg, and Greg Cohen. Croce co-wrote a few of the songs on &quot;Twelve Tales&quot;, including one song with Leon Russell.

In 2014, Croce spoke at TEDxLaJolla, an independently produced TED.

His 2017 album, &quot;Just Like Medicine&quot;, according to ABC News, &quot;sounds like it was crafted with the influence of greats like Van Morrison, Bob Dylan and Elvis Costello in mind&quot;.

==Personal life==
Croce lives in East Nashville, Tennessee. In 2018, his wife, Marlo Gordon Croce, died of a rare and sudden heart virus while he was in the midst of his own health scare. A.J. was left a single father to two children.

<text>Bream Head is a promontory on the east coast of Northland in the North Island of New Zealand. Located at the end of a 30 kilometre-long peninsula, the head juts into the Pacific Ocean to the southeast of Whangārei. The Te Whara Track in the Bream Head Scenic Reserve is at least 700 years old. The Hen and Chicken Islands are located off the headland at a distance of 12 kilometres. It forms the northern extremity of Bream Bay, and guards the entrance to Whangārei Harbour, a natural inlet extending to the northwest. The Marsden Point Oil Refinery is located on the opposing shore of the harbour five kilometres to the west.

To Bream Head&#x27;s immediate north is a long sandy beach called Ocean Beach.

==Biology==
It contains a scenic reserve, the Bream Head Scenic Reserve, which unlike Bream Head is an official name. This has a long history of Māori occupation, being now wāhi tapu, and is one of the most important coastal broadleaf forest reserves in Northland with its population of native flax snail – pūpūharakeke and Whirinaki skinks.

==Geology==
Bream Head features a prominent bluff usually known by the same name or Te Whara in height, and to its west Mount Lion at a height of , the remains of a Miocene andesitic volcano.

<doc id="1247283" wikidata="Q1110527" url="?curid=1247283" title="Priest Lake">
<text>Priest Lake is a lake in Idaho, United States, in the northernmost portion of the Idaho Panhandle, northeast of Spokane, Washington. The northern end of the lake extends to within of the Canada–United States border. The primary lake, lower Priest, is long and over deep. Upper Priest is connected by a thoroughfare to lower Priest.

==History==
The history of the lake dates back almost 10,000 years to the end of the last ice age. After the vast glaciers that had covered most of the area receded and vegetation started to regrow, humans started to resettle the area. That is evident from historical artifacts found in the area and ancient rock art along the lake.

In the early 19th century fur trappers established trade with the native Kalispel tribe. In the 1840s Jesuit priest Pierre-Jean DeSmet began working with the Kalispel tribe along the nearby Pend Oreille River. From the tribe&#x27;s information about Priest Lake, De Smet was able to create a map and named the lake Roothaan Lake for one of his superiors in Rome. The name would not stick though and in 1865 Captain John Mullan, a U.S. Army Captain who was traveling through the area under orders to build a road (later known as the &quot;Mullan Road&quot;) from Walla Walla, Washington to Fort Benton, Montana, after the discovery of silver in the central Idaho mountains along what today is the route of Interstate 90, would rename the lake Kaniksu. The lake was later named Priest Lake.

==Logging==
Since the 1890s, logging has played an important role at Priest Lake. Logs were floated down the lake, and eventually to the outlet where they would travel down the Priest River until they reached the mills on the Pend Oreille River. National concern over conservation of natural resources led to the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, under which the Priest River Forest Reserve was established in 1897. This forest reserve subsequently evolved into the Kaniksu National Forest – which has been recently incorporated into the Idaho Panhandle National Forests system. Most of the area on the east side of Priest Lake became school or endowment land for Idaho. In 1911, the state wanted to consolidate the three million acres of scattered parcels it received with statehood into a compact body to better manage timber sales effectively. It took 10 years of talks with the Secretary of Agriculture, a proclamation from President William Howard Taft, multiple court cases, much lobbying by timber interests, and an act of the U.S. Congress for Idaho to receive title to the Kaniksu National Forest&#x27;s eastside land in 1917. In 1950 these state lands to the east of Priest Lake were designated as Priest Lake State Forest. Later, in the 1980s, the State executed land exchanges with private companies that added nearly 13,000 acres (53 km2) to the state forest and resulted in its present boundaries.

==Wildlife==
Priest Lake has a pristine variety of wildlife both in and around the lake. The standard bear, deer, and moose population that can be seen throughout northern Washington and Idaho is present about the lake, as well as a small population of grizzly bears. Priest Lake also has a large population of fish, including cutthroat trout, Kokanee, lake trout, and Dolly Varden trout. The largest lake trout caught in the United States was caught at Priest Lake, by a Spokane Washington man, Lyle McClure, in 1971 and weighed 57 lbs. 8 oz. The average lake trout ranges weighs in between 4 and 10 pounds.

In 2006, Eurasian milfoil, an aquatic invasive species, was discovered in Priest Lake.

==Tourism==
Today, the lake&#x27;s biggest draw is tourism. There are several large private resorts on the lake including Cavanaugh&#x27;s Resort, Elkins Resort and Hill&#x27;s Resort. Popular campgrounds include Indian Creek and Lionhead run by the State of Idaho as well as Beaver Creek, Reeder Bay, Osprey, Outlet Bay, and Luby Bay, which are all located in and run by the Idaho Panhandle National Forest. Several hiking trails circle the lake, also connecting to the Upper Priest Lake. In the wintertime, the larger resorts cater to cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling. There is also a bed and breakfast - the historic Old Northern Inn, Coolin Motel, Nordman Resort (Nordman, Idaho), and three marinas, one located at the lake&#x27;s largest town, Coolin. The Priest Lake Public Library, located at the corner of Luby Bay Road and Highway 57, is open year-round. Housed in the historic Lamb Creek School, the library has wireless internet access and an extensive local history collection. The Priest Lake Museum, located in a 1935 USFS Guard Station on Luby Bay, hosts exhibits and programs on the area&#x27;s rich heritage. The area is known for its huckleberries which visitors are encouraged to hike in and pick.

==Weather==
Both summer and winter activities at the lake are made possible by a truly four-season climate. Summers are generally warm and sunny with high temperatures around 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius). Swimming and boating are very popular in the summer. Winters are cold and snowy, and although not as cold as east of the Rocky Mountains, the area does get much more snow. Sixty inches (1.5 m) precipitation falls in the mountains around the lake each year with almost half of that coming in the form of snow. Cross country skiing and snowmobiling are popular winter activities.

<doc id="1247285" wikidata="Q3307894" url="?curid=1247285" title="Hmong language">
<text>Hmong or Mong ( ; RPA: , CHV: &quot;Hmôngz&quot;, Nyiakeng Puachue: , Pahawh: , ) is a dialect continuum of the West Hmongic branch of the Hmongic languages spoken by the Hmong people of Southwestern China, northern Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos. There are an estimated 4.5 million speakers of varieties that are largely mutually intelligible, including over 280,000 Hmong Americans as of 2013. Over half of all Hmong speakers speak the various dialects in China, where the Dananshan dialect forms the basis of the standard language. However, Hmong Daw and Mong Leng are widely known only in Laos and the United States; Dananshan is more widely known in the native region of Hmong.

==Varieties==
Mong Leng () and Hmong Daw () are part of a dialect cluster known in China as (), called the &quot;Chuanqiandian &quot;cluster&quot;&quot; in English (or &quot;Miao cluster&quot; in other languages) since West Hmongic is also called . The variety spoken from Sichuan in China to Thailand and Laos is referred to in China as the &quot;First Local Variety&quot; () of the cluster. Mong Leng and Hmong Daw are just those varieties of the cluster that migrated to Laos. The names &quot;Mong Leng&quot;, &quot;Hmong Dleu/Der&quot;, and &quot;Hmong Daw&quot; are also used in China for various dialects of the cluster.

&quot;Ethnologue&quot; once distinguished only the Laotian varieties (Hmong Daw, Mong Leng), Sinicized Miao (Hmong Shua), and the Vietnamese varieties (Hmong Dô, Hmong Don). The Vietnamese varieties are very poorly known; population estimates are not even available. In 2007, Horned Miao, Small Flowery Miao, and the Chuanqiandian cluster of China were split off from Mong Leng [blu].

These varieties are as follows, along with some alternative names.
* Hmong/Mong/Chuanqiandian Miao macrolanguage (China, Laos, also spoken by minorities in Thailand and the United States), including:
** Hmong Daw (&quot;Hmong Der&quot;, , , , &#x27;White Hmong&#x27;; Chinese: , , &#x27;White Miao&#x27;),
** Mong Leng (, , , &#x27;Blue/Green Hmong&#x27;; Chinese: , , &#x27;Blue-Green Miao&#x27;),
** Hmong Shua (; &#x27;Sinicized Miao&#x27;),
** Hmo or A-Hmo (Chinese: , , &#x27;Horned Miao&#x27;),
** Small Flowery Miao,
** and the rest of the Chuanqiandian Miao cluster located in China.
* Hmong languages of Vietnam, not considered part of the China/Laos macrolanguage and possibly forming their own distinct macrolanguage — they are still not very well classified even if they are described by &quot;Ethnologue&quot; as having vigorous use (in Vietnam) but without population estimates; they have most probably been influenced by Vietnamese, as well as by French (in the former Indochina colonies) and later American English, and they may be confused with varieties spoken by minorities living today in the United States, Europe or elsewhere in Asia (where their varieties may have been assimilated locally, but separately in each area, with other Hmong varieties imported from Laos and China):
** Hmong Dô (Vietnam),
** Hmong Don (Vietnam, assumed).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated that the White and Leng dialects &quot;are said to be mutually intelligible to a well-trained ear, with pronunciation and vocabulary differences analogous to the differences between British and American English.&quot;

Several Chinese varieties may overlap with or be more distinct than the varieties listed above:
* Dananshan Miao (, ; called in Northern Hmong), the basis of the Chinese standard of the Chuanqiandian cluster
* Black Miao (subgroups: , /; Chinese: , )
* Southern Hmong (subgroups: , , , ; includes Mong Leng)
* Northern Hmong (subgroups: , /, )
* Western Sichuan Miao (Chinese: , )

In the 2007 request to establish an ISO code for the Chuanqiandian cluster, corresponding to the &quot;first local dialect&quot; () of the Chuanqiandian cluster in Chinese, the proposer made the following statement on mutual intelligibility:
===Varieties in Laos===
According to the CDC, &quot;although there is no official preference for one dialect over the other, White Hmong seems to be favored in many ways&quot;: the Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA) most closely reflects that of White Hmong (&quot;Hmong Daw&quot;); most educated Hmong speak White Hmong because White Hmong people lack the ability to understand Mong Leng; and most Hmong dictionaries only include the White Hmong dialect. Furthermore, younger generations of Hmong are more likely to speak White Hmong, and speakers of Mong Leng are more likely to understand White Hmong than speakers of White Hmong are.

===Varieties in the United States===
Most Hmong in the United States speak White Hmong (Hmoob Dawb) and Mong Leng (Moob Leeg), with around 60% speaking White Hmong and 40% Mong Leng. The CDC states that &quot;though some Hmong report difficulty understanding speakers of a dialect not their own, for the most part, Mong Leng seem to do better when understanding both dialects.&quot;

==Phonology==
The three dialects described here are Hmong Daw (also called White Miao or Hmong Der), Mong Leeg (also called Blue/Green Miao or Mong Leng), and Dananshan (Standard Chinese Miao). Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg are the two major dialects spoken by Hmong Americans. Although mutually intelligible, the dialects differ in both lexicon and certain aspects of phonology. For instance, Mong Leeg lacks the voiceless/aspirated of Hmong Daw (as exemplified by their names) and has a third nasalized vowel, ; Dananshan has a couple of extra diphthongs in native words, numerous Chinese loans, and an eighth tone.

===Vowels===
The vowel systems of Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg are as shown in the following charts. (Phonemes particular to Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg are color-coded and indicated by a dagger or double dagger respectively.)

# 1st Row: IPA, Hmong RPA
# 2nd Row: Nyiakeng Puachue
# 3rd Row: Pahawh

The Dananshan standard of China is similar. Phonemic differences from Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg are color-coded and marked as absent or added.
Dananshan occurs only after non-palatal affricates, and is written , much like Mandarin Chinese. is pronounced after palatal consonants. There is also a triphthong , as well as other i- and u-initial sequences in Chinese borrowings, such as .

===Consonants===
Hmong makes a number of phonemic contrasts unfamiliar to English speakers. All non-glottal stops and affricates distinguish aspirated and unaspirated forms, and most also distinguish prenasalization independently of this. The consonant inventory of Hmong is shown in the chart below. (Consonants particular to Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg are color-coded and indicated by a dagger or double dagger respectively.)

#1st Row: IPA, Hmong RPA
#2nd Row: Nyiakeng Puachue
#3rd Row: Pahawh
The Dananshan standard of China is similar. (Phonemic differences from Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg are color-coded and marked as absent or added. Minor differences, such as the voicing of prenasalized stops, or whether is an affricate or is velar, may be a matter of transcription.) Aspirates, voiceless fricatives, voiceless nasals, and glottal stop only occur with &quot;yin&quot; tones (1, 3, 5, 7). Standard orthography is added in angled brackets. The glottal stop is not written; it is not distinct from a zero initial. There is also a , which occurs only in foreign words.
 The status of the consonants described here as single phonemes with lateral release is controversial. A number of scholars instead analyze them as biphonemic clusters with as the second element. The difference in analysis (e.g., between and ) is not based on any disagreement in the sound or pronunciation of the consonants in question, but on differing theoretical grounds. Those in favor of a unit-phoneme analysis generally argue for this based on distributional evidence (i.e., if clusters, these would be the only clusters in the language, although see below) and dialect evidence (the laterally released dentals in Mong Leeg, e.g. , correspond to the voiced dentals of White Hmong), whereas those in favor of a cluster analysis tend to argue on the basis of general phonetic principles (other examples of labial phonemes with lateral release appear extremely rare or nonexistent).

 Some linguists prefer to analyze the prenasalized consonants as clusters whose first element is . However, this cluster analysis is not as common as the above one involving .

 Only used in Hmong RPA and not in Pahawh Hmong, since Hmong RPA uses Latin script and Pahawh Hmong does not. For example, in Hmong RPA, to write , the order Consonant + Vowel + Tone (CVT) must be followed, so it is &quot;k&quot; + &quot;ee&quot; + &quot;b&quot; = , but in Pahawh Hmong, it is just &quot;&quot; (3rd-Stage Version).

===Syllable structure===
Hmong syllables have simple structure: all syllables have an onset consonant (except in a few particles), nuclei may consist of a monophthong or diphthong, and the only coda consonants that occur are nasals. In Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg, nasal codas have become nasalized vowels, though they may be accompanied by weakly articulated . Similarly, a short may accompany the low-falling creaky tone.

Dananshan has a syllabic (written ) in Chinese loans, such as &#x27;two&#x27; and &#x27;child&#x27;.

===Tones===
Hmong is a tonal language and makes use of seven (Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg) or eight (Dananshan) distinct tones.
The Dananshan tones are transcribed as pure tone. However, given how similar several of them are, it is likely that there are also phonational differences as in Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg. Tones 4 and 6, for example, are said to make tenuis plosives breathy voiced (), suggesting they may be breathy/murmured like the Hmong &quot;g&quot;-tone. Tones 7 and 8 are used in early Chinese loans with entering tone, suggesting they may once have marked checked syllables.

Because voiceless consonants apart from tenuis plosives are restricted to appearing before certain tones (1, 3, 5, 7), those are placed first in the table:
So much information is conveyed by the tones that it is possible to speak intelligibly using musical tunes only; there is a tradition of young lovers communicating covertly playing a Jew&#x27;s harp to convey vowel sounds.

==Orthography==

Robert Cooper, an anthropologist, collected a Hmong folktale saying that the Hmong used to have a written language, and important information was written down in a treasured book. The folktale explains that cows and rats ate the book, so, in the words of Anne Fadiman, author of &quot;The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down&quot;, &quot;no text was equal to the task of representing a culture as rich as that of the Hmong.&quot; Therefore, the folktale states that the Hmong language was exclusively oral from that point onwards.

Natalie Jill Smith, author of &quot;Ethnicity, Reciprocity, Reputation and Punishment: An Ethnoexperimental Study of Cooperation among the Chaldeans and Hmong of Detroit (Michigan)&quot;, wrote that the Qing Dynasty had caused a previous Hmong writing system to die out when it stated that the death penalty would be imposed on those who wrote it down.

Since the end of the 19th century, linguists created over two dozen Hmong writing systems, including systems using Chinese characters, the Lao alphabet, the Cyrillic script, the Thai alphabet, and the Vietnamese alphabet. In addition, in 1959 Shong Lue Yang, a Hmong spiritual leader from Laos, created an 81 symbol writing system called Pahawh. Yang was not previously literate in any language. Chao Fa, an anti-Laotian government Hmong group, uses this writing system.

In the 1980s, Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong script was created by a Hmong Minister, Reverend Chervang Kong Vang, to be able to capture Hmong vocabulary clearly and also to remedy redundancies in the language as well as address semantic confusions that was lacking in other scripts. Nyiakeng Puachue Hmong script was mainly used by United Christians Liberty Evangelical Church, a church also founded by Vang, although the script have been found to be in use in Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, France, and Australia. The script bears strong resemblance to the Lao alphabet in structure and form and characters inspired from the Hebrew alphabets, although the characters themselves are different.

Other experiments by Hmong and non-Hmong orthographers have been undertaken using invented letters.

The Romanized Popular Alphabet (RPA), the most widely used script for Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg, was developed in Laos between 1951 and 1953 by three Western missionaries. In the United States Hmong do not use RPA for spelling of proper nouns, because they want their names to be easily pronounced by people unfamiliar with RPA. For instance Hmong in the U.S. spell &quot;Hmoob&quot; as &quot;Hmong,&quot; and &quot;Liab Lis&quot; is spelled as Lia Lee.

The Dananshan standard in China is written in a pinyin-based alphabet, with tone letters similar to those used in RPA.

===Correspondence between orthographies===
The following is a list of pairs of RPA and Dananshan segments having the same sound (or very similar sounds). Note however that RPA and the standard in China not only differ in orthographic rules, but are also used to write different languages. The list is ordered alphabetically by the RPA, apart from prenasalized stops and voiceless sonorants, which come after their oral and voiced homologues. There are three overriding patterns to the correspondences: RPA doubles a vowel for nasalization, whereas pinyin uses ; RPA uses for aspiration, whereas pinyin uses the voicing distinction of the Latin script; pinyin uses (and ) to derive the retroflex and uvular series from the dental and velar, whereas RPA uses sequences based on vs. for the same.

====Vowels====
====Consonants====
There is no simple correspondence between the tone letters. The historical connection between the tones is as follows. The Chinese names reflect the tones given to early Chinese loan words with those tones in Chinese.

Tones 4 and 7 merged in Hmoob Dawb, whereas tones 4 and 6 merged in Mong Leeg.

Example: &quot;lus Hmoob&quot; /̤ lṳ˧˩ m̥̥õ˦ / / (White Hmong) / &quot;lug Moob&quot; / / (Mong Leng) / &quot;lol Hmongb&quot; (Dananshan) / &quot;lus Hmôngz&quot; (Vietnamese) &quot;Hmong language&quot;.

==Grammar==
Hmong is an analytic SVO language in which adjectives and demonstratives follow the noun.

===Nouns===
Noun phrases can contain the following elements (parentheses indicate optional elements):

(possessive) + (quantifier) + (classifier) + noun + (adjective) + (demonstrative)

The Hmong pronominal system distinguishes between three grammatical persons and three numbers – singular, dual, and plural. They are not marked for case, that is, the same word is used to translate both &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;, &quot;she&quot; and &quot;her&quot;, and so forth. These are the personal pronouns of Hmong Daw and Mong Leeg:

#1st Row: IPA, Hmong RPA
#2nd Row: Vietnamese Hmong
#3rd Row: Pahawh Hmong
#4th Row: Nyiakeng Puachue

====Classifiers====
Classifiers are one of the features recurrently found in languages of Southeast Asia. In Hmong, the noun does not directly follow a numeral, and a classifier or an adjective is required to count objects. Here are examples from Mong Leeg (Green Hmong):

Also, classifiers may occur with a noun without any numerals for definite and/or specific reference in Hmong. The following examples are again from Green Hmong:



Moreover, nominal possessive phrases are expressed with a classifier; however, it may be omitted when the referent of the possessed noun is inalienable from the possessor as shown in the following Hmong Daw (White Hmong) phrases:

Relativization is also expressed with classifiers.

Although absent in Mandarin Chinese, definite reference by bare classifier constructions are found in Cantonese (Sinitic) and Zhuang (Kra-dai), which is the case for possessive classifier constructions as well.

===Verbs===
Hmong is an isolating language in which most morphemes are monosyllables. As a result, verbs are not overtly inflected. Tense, aspect, mood, person, number, gender, and case are indicated lexically.

====Serial verb construction====
Hmong verbs can be serialized, with two or more verbs combined in one clause. It is common for as many as five verbs to be strung together, sharing the same subject.

Here is an example from White Hmong:

====Tense====
Because the verb form in Hmong does not change to indicate tense, the simplest way to indicate the time of an event is to use temporal adverb phrases like &quot;last year,&quot; &quot;today,&quot; or &quot;next week.&quot;

Here is an example from White Hmong:

====Aspect====
Aspectual differences are indicated by a number of verbal modifiers. Here are the most common ones:

Progressive: (Mong Leeg) &quot;taab tom&quot; + verb, (White Hmong) &quot;tab tom&quot; + verb = situation in progress

{{interlinear|indent=2|glossing5=yes|c1=(Mong Leeg)
|Puab {taab tom} haus dlej.
|Puôz {tangz tov} hâus đrêx
|{{script|Hmng|𖬐𖬶𖬪𖬵}} {{{script|Hmng|𖬚𖬲𖬧𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬒𖬧𖬵}}} {{script|Hmng|𖬅𖬰𖬟}} {{script|Hmng|𖬈𖬲𖬭}}.
|{{script|Hmnp|𞄚𞄧𞄰𞄤}} {{{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄥𞄰}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄨𞄱}}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄄𞄤𞄴𞄨}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄏𞄪𞄲}}.
|they PROG drink water
|&#x27;They are drinking water.&#x27;}}

&quot;Taab/tab tom&quot; + verb can also be used to indicate a situation that is about to start. That is clearest when &quot;taab/tab&quot; tom occurs in conjunction with the irrealis marker &quot;yuav&quot;. Note that the &quot;taab tom&quot; construction is not used if it is clear from the context that a situation is ongoing or about to begin.

Perfective: sentence/clause + &quot;lawm&quot; = completed situation

{{interlinear|indent=2|glossing5=yes|c1=(Leeg and White Hmong)
|Kuv noj mov lawm.
|Cur nox mor lơưv
|{{script|Hmng|𖬆𖬲}} {{script|Hmng|𖬒𖬲𖬬}} {{script|Hmng|𖬒𖬶𖬦}} {{script|Hmng|𖬎𖬰𖬞}}.
|{{script|Hmnp|𞄎𞄧𞄳}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄅𞄨𞄲}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄀𞄨𞄳}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄉𞄤𞄱𞄬}}.
|I eat rice PERF
|&#x27;I am finished/I am done eating rice.&#x27; / &#x27;I have already eaten &quot;rice&quot;.&#x27;}}

&quot;Lawm&quot; at the end of a sentence can also indicate that an action is underway:

{{interlinear|indent=2|glossing4=yes|c1=(White Hmong)
|Tus tub tau rab hneev, nws thiaj mus {ua si} lawm.
|{{script|Hmng|𖬇𖬰𖬧𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬆𖬰𖬧𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬧𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬖𖬲𖬡}} {{script|Hmng|𖬀𖬲𖬩}}, {{script|Hmng|𖬙𖬲𖬬}} {{script|Hmng|𖬔𖬶𖬟𖬰}} {{script|Hmng|𖬇𖬰𖬦}} {{script|Hmng|𖬑𖬮𖬰 𖬃𖬤𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬎𖬰𖬞}}.
|{{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄧𞄴}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄧𞄰}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄤𞄨}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄖𞄤𞄰}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄅𞄄𞄳𞄫}}, {{script|Hmnp|𞄅𞄬𞄴}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄄𞄦𞄲𞄤}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄀𞄧𞄴}} {{{script|Hmnp|𞄧𞄤}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄊𞄦}}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄉𞄤𞄱𞄬}}.
|CLF boy get CLF crossbow he then go play PFV
|&#x27;The boy got the crossbow and went off to play.&#x27; / &#x27;The boy went off to play because he got the bow.&#x27;}}

Another common way to indicate the accomplishment of an action or attainment is by using &quot;tau&quot;, which, as a main verb, means &#x27;to get/obtain.&#x27; It takes on different connotations when it is combined with other verbs. When it occurs before the main verb (i.e. &quot;tau&quot; + verb), it conveys the attainment or fulfillment of a situation. Whether the situation took place in the past, the present, or the future is indicated at the discourse level rather than the sentence level. If the event took place in the past, &quot;tau&quot; + verb translates to the past tense in English.

{{interlinear|indent=2|glossing4=yes|c1=(White Hmong)
|Lawv tau noj nqaij nyug.
|{{script|Hmng|𖬎𖬶𖬞}} {{script|Hmng|𖬧𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬒𖬲𖬬}} {{script|Hmng|𖬊𖬶𖬬𖬰}} {{script|Hmng|𖬇𖬲𖬮𖬵}}.
|{{script|Hmnp|𞄉𞄤𞄳𞄬}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄤𞄨}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄅𞄨𞄲}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄙𞄤𞄲𞄦}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄐𞄧𞄵}}.
|they attain eat meat beef
|&#x27;They ate beef.&#x27;}}

&quot;Tau&quot; is optional if an explicit past time marker is present (e.g. &quot;nag hmo&quot;, last night). &quot;Tau&quot; can also mark the fulfillment of a situation in the future:

{{interlinear|indent=2|glossing4=yes|c1=(White Hmong)
|Thaum txog peb caug lawm {sawv daws} thiaj tau hnav {khaub ncaws} tshiab.
|{{script|Hmng|𖬄𖬟𖬰}} {{script|Hmng|𖬓𖬯𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬈𖬰𖬪𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬅𖬲𖬯}} {{script|Hmng|𖬎𖬰𖬞}} {{{script|Hmng|𖬎𖬶𖬤𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬏𖬰𖬞𖬰}}} {{script|Hmng|𖬔𖬶𖬟𖬰}} {{script|Hmng|𖬧𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬗𖬩}} {{{script|Hmng|𖬄𖬰𖬩𖬰}} {{script|Hmng|𖬏𖬰𖬤𖬰}}} {{script|Hmng|𖬔𖬪𖬰}}.
|{{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄄𞄤𞄱𞄨}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄔𞄨𞄵}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄚𞄪𞄰}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄈𞄤𞄵𞄨}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄉𞄤𞄱𞄬}} {{{script|Hmnp|𞄊𞄤𞄳𞄬}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄏𞄤𞄴𞄬}}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄄𞄦𞄲𞄤}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄤𞄨}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄅𞄄𞄳𞄤}} {{{script|Hmnp|𞄎𞄄𞄤𞄰𞄨}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄌𞄤𞄴𞄬}}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄁𞄄𞄦𞄰𞄤}}.
|when arrive New Year PFV everybody then attain wear clothes new
|&#x27;So when the New Year arrives, everybody gets to wear new clothes.&#x27;}}

When &quot;tau&quot; follows the main verb (i.e. verb + &quot;tau&quot;), it indicates the accomplishment of the purpose of an action.

{{interlinear|indent=2|glossing4=yes|c1=(Mong Leeg)
|Kuv xaav xaav {ib plag}, kuv xaav tau {tswv yim}.
|{{script|Hmng|𖬆𖬲 }} {{script|Hmng|𖬛𖬮}} {{script|Hmng|𖬛𖬮}} {{{script|Hmng|𖬂𖬲𖬮𖬰 }} {{script|Hmng|𖬗𖬶𖬟𖬵}}}, {{script|Hmng|𖬆𖬲}} {{script|Hmng|𖬛𖬮}} {{script|Hmng|𖬧𖬵}} {{script|Hmng|𖬙𖬝𖬰 𖬂𖬤}}.
|{{script|Hmnp|𞄎𞄧𞄳}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄆𞄥𞄳}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄆𞄥𞄳}} {{{script|Hmnp|𞄦𞄰}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄡𞄤𞄵}}}, {{script|Hmnp|𞄎𞄧𞄳}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄆𞄥𞄳}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄃𞄤𞄨}} {{{script|Hmnp|𞄁𞄬𞄳}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄘𞄦𞄱}}}.
|I think think awhile, I think get idea
|&#x27;I thought it over and got an idea.&#x27;}}

&quot;Tau&quot; is also common in serial verb constructions that are made up of a verb, followed by an accomplishment: (White Hmong) &quot;nrhiav tau&quot;, to look for; &quot;caum tau&quot;, to chase; &quot;yug tau&quot;, to give birth.

====Mood====
The grammatical marker {{lang|mww|yuav}} is analyzed by some scholars as a future tense marker{{sfn | Mottin | 1978}}{{sfn | Jaisser | 1984}} when it appears preceding a verb:
{{interlinear|indent=2|c1=(Mong Leeg)
|Kuv yuav moog.
|{{script|Hmng|𖬆𖬲}} {{script|Hmng|𖬐𖬲𖬤}} {{script|Hmng|𖬍𖬶𖬦}}.
|{{script|Hmnp|𞄎𞄧𞄳}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄘𞄧𞄳𞄤}} {{script|Hmnp|𞄀𞄩𞄵}}.
|&#x27;I will be going.&#x27;}}

{{lang|mww|Yuav}} can also be analyzed as a marker of irrealis mood, for situations that are unfulfilled or unrealized.{{sfn | White | 2014 | pp=80-81}} That includes hypothetical or non-occurring situations with past, present, or future time references:

==Vocabulary==
=== Overview ===
Hmong vocabulary comes from several sources: native Hmongic words, Chinese borrowings, and Tibeto-Burman borrowings,{{sfn | Ratliff | 2010 | p=242}} as well as additional borrowings from the national languages where Hmong communities live outside China, including borrowings from Thai/Lao and English.{{sfn | White | 2021 | p=164}}

==== Colors ====
Many Hmong and non-Hmong people who are learning the Hmong language tend to use the word {{lang|mww|xim}} (a borrowing from Thai/Lao) as the word for &#x27;color&#x27;, while the native Hmong word for &#x27;color&#x27; is {{lang|mww|kob}}. For example, {{lang|mww|xim}} appears in the sentence {{lang|mww|Liab yog xim ntawm kev phom sij}} with the meaning &quot;Red is the color of danger / The red color is of danger&quot;.

List of colors:

The following color terms are given as in Hmong Daw (White Hmong) and Hmong Leeg (Green Hmong).

{{Clear}}

Several of the Hmong terms for colors are native roots that date back to at least the Proto-Hmongic period, such as {{lang|mww|dub}} &#x27;black&#x27;, {{lang|mww|dawb}} &#x27;white&#x27;, and {{lang|mww|liab}} &#x27;red&#x27;, while {{lang|mww|daj}} &#x27;yellow&#x27; was a very early borrowing from Chinese.{{sfn | Ratliff | 2010 | p=243}} Several other terms are more recent innovations.

==== Numbers ====

The number 57023 would be written as {{script|Hmng|𖭕𖭗𖭐𖭒𖭓}}.

==== Days of the week ====

A sentence like &quot;Today is Monday&quot;, using only non-borrowed, non-calqued terms, would be said {{lang|mww|Hnub no yog zwj hli}}, rather than {{lang|mww|Hnub no yog hnub ib/Monday}} in Hmong. However, Hmong speakers in English-speaking countries sometimes use Thai/Lao loanwords or English terms for the days of the week instead, as in Mong Leng {{lang|hnj|ua ntej nub Saturday}} &#x27;before Saturday&#x27;.{{sfn | White | 2021 | p=167}}

==== Months of the year ====
==Worldwide usage==
===Presence in community and education===
The Hmong language has found a significant presence in the United States, particularly in Minnesota. The Hmong people first arrived in Minnesota in late 1975 following the communist seizure of power in Indochina. Many educated Hmong elites with leadership experience and English-language skills were among the first to be welcomed by Minnesotans. These elites worked to solidify the social services targeted to refugees, attracting others to migrate to the region. The first Hmong family arrived in Minnesota on 5 November 1975.

The Hmong language program in the Department of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Minnesota is one of the first programs in the United States to teach language-accredited Hmong classes.

===Translation===
In February 2012, Microsoft released &quot;Hmong Daw&quot; as an option in Bing Translator. In May 2013, Google Translate introduced support for Hmong Daw (referred to only as &quot;Hmong&quot;).

Research in nursing shows that when translating from English to Hmong, the translator must take into account that Hmong comes from an oral tradition and equivalent concepts may not exist. For example, the word and concept for &quot;prostate&quot; does not exist.

== In popular culture ==

The decision to cast Hmong actors received a positive reception in Hmong communities. The film also gained recognition and collected awards such as the Ten Best Films of 2008 from the American Film Institute and a César Award in France for Best Foreign Film.

==Notes==
{{note label|PopulationEthnologue|a}}Ethnologue uses the term &quot;Hmong&quot; as a &quot;macrolanguage&quot;, i.e., along the lines of the Chinese 苗语 &quot;Miáoyǔ&quot; &quot;Miao language&quot;, to handle the fact that some mainland Chinese academic sources lump many individual languages together into single &quot;language&quot; categories, while international sources almost universally keep these languages distinct. As the current article is focused on the Hmong language proper as found in international published sources, the population figure here reflects this. Ethnologue (17th edition) lists the population of the larger macrolanguage at 8.1 million.

<text>The Fabric of the Cosmos: Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality (2004) is the second book on theoretical physics, cosmology, and string theory written by Brian Greene, professor and co-director of Columbia&#x27;s Institute for Strings, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics (ISCAP).

==Introduction==
Greene begins with the key question: &quot;what is reality?&quot;, or more specifically, &quot;what is spacetime?&quot; He sets out to describe the features he finds both exciting and essential to forming a full picture of the reality painted by modern science. In almost every chapter, Greene introduces basic concepts and then slowly builds to a climax, usually a scientific breakthrough. Greene then attempts to connect with his reader by posing simple analogies to help explain the meaning of a scientific concept without oversimplifying the theory behind it.

In the preface, Greene acknowledges that some parts of the book are controversial among scientists. He discusses the leading viewpoints in the main text and points of contention in the endnotes. The endnotes contain more complete explanations of points that are simplified in the main text.

== Summary ==

===Part I: Reality&#x27;s Arena===
The main focus of Part I is space and time.

Chapter 1, &quot;Roads to Reality&quot;, Introduces what is to come later in the book, such as discussions revolving around classical physics, quantum mechanics, and cosmological physics.

Chapter 2, &quot;The Universe and the Bucket&quot;, features space as its key point. The question posed by Greene is this: &quot;Is space a human abstraction, or is it a physical entity?&quot; The key thought experiment is a spinning bucket of water, designed to make one think about what creates the force felt inside the bucket when it is spinning. The ideas of Isaac Newton, Ernst Mach, and Gottfried Leibniz on this thought experiment are discussed in detail.

Chapter 3, &quot;Relativity and the Absolute&quot;, focuses on spacetime. The question now becomes: &quot;Is spacetime an Einsteinian abstraction or a physical entity?&quot; In this chapter, concepts of both special relativity and general relativity are discussed, as well as their importance to the meaning of spacetime.

In chapter 4, &quot;Entangling Space&quot;, Greene explores the revolution of the quantum mechanical era, focusing on what it means for objects to be separate and distinct in a universe dictated by quantum laws. This chapter studies quantum mechanics, including the concepts of probability waves and interference patterns, particle spin, the photon double slit experiment, and Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle. The reader is also informed of challenges posed to quantum mechanics by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen.

===Part II: Time and Experience===
Part II begins by addressing the issue that time is a very familiar concept, yet it is one of humanity&#x27;s least understood concepts.

Chapter 5, &quot;The Frozen River&quot;, deals with the question, &quot;Does time flow?&quot; One key point in this chapter deals with special relativity. Observers moving relative to each other have different conceptions of what exists at a given moment, and hence they have different conceptions of reality. The conclusion is that time does not flow, as all things simultaneously exist at the same time.

Chapter 6, &quot;Chance and the Arrow&quot;, asks, &quot;Does time have an arrow?&quot; The reader discovers that the laws of physics apply moving both forward in time and backward in time. Such a law is called time-reversal symmetry. One of the major subjects of this chapter is entropy. Various analogies are given to illustrate how entropy works and its apparent paradoxes. The climax of the chapter is the co-relation between entropy and gravity, and that the beginning of the Universe must be the state of minimum entropy.

In Chapters 5 and 6, time has been explained only in terms of pre-modern physics. Chapter 7, &quot;Time and the Quantum&quot;, gives insights into time&#x27;s nature in the quantum mechanics. Probability plays a major role in this chapter because it is an inescapable part of quantum mechanics. The double slit experiment is revisited to reveal things about the past. Many other experiments are presented in this chapter, such as the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment. Other major issues are brought to the reader&#x27;s attention, such as quantum mechanics and experience, as well as quantum mechanics and the measurement problem. Finally, this chapter addresses the important subject of decoherence and its relevance towards the macroscopic world.

===Part III: Spacetime and Cosmology===
Part III deals with the macroscopic realm of the cosmos.

Chapter 8, &quot;Of Snowflakes and Spacetime&quot;, tells the reader that the history of the universe is in fact the history of symmetry. Symmetry and its importance to cosmic evolution becomes the focus of this chapter. Again, general relativity is addressed as a stretching fabric of spacetime. Cosmology, symmetry, and the shape of space are put together in a new way.

Chapter 9, &quot;Vaporizing the Vacuum&quot;, introduces the theoretical idea of the Higgs boson. This chapter focuses on the critical first fraction of a second after the Big Bang, when the amount of symmetry in the universe was thought to have changed abruptly by a process known as symmetry breaking. This chapter also brings into play the theory of grand unification and entropy is also revisited.

Chapter 10, &quot;Deconstructing the Bang&quot;, makes inflationary cosmology the main point. General relativity and the discovery of dark energy (repulsive gravity) are taken into account, as well as the cosmological constant. Certain problems that arise due to the standard Big Bang theory are addressed, and new answers are given using inflationary cosmology. Such problems include the horizon problem and the flatness problem. Matter distribution throughout the cosmos is also discussed, including the concepts of dark matter and dark energy.

Chapter 11, &quot;Quanta in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, continues with the topic of inflation, and the arrow of time is also discussed again. The chapter addresses three main developments: the formation of structures such as galaxies, the amount of energy required to spawn the universe we now see, and the origin of time&#x27;s arrow.

===Part IV: Origins and Unification===
Part IV deals with new theoretical aspects of physics, particularly in the author&#x27;s field.

Chapter 12, &quot;The World on a String&quot;, informs the reader of the structure of the fabric of space according to string theory. New concepts are introduced, including the Planck length and the Planck time, and ideas from &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; are revisited. The reader will learn how string theory could fill the gaps between general relativity and quantum mechanics.

Chapter 13, &quot;The Universe on a Brane&quot;, expands on ideas from chapter 12, particularly on M-theory, of which string theory is a branch. This chapter is devoted to speculations on space and time. The insights of a number of physicists, including Edward Witten and Paul Dirac, are presented. The focus of the chapter becomes gravity and its involvement with extra dimensions. Near the end of the chapter, a brief section is devoted to the cyclic model.

===Part V: Reality and Imagination===
Part V deals with many theoretical concepts, including space and time travel.

Chapter 14, &quot;Up in the Heavens and Down on the Earth&quot;, is about various experiments with space and time. Previous theories are brought back from previous chapters, such as Higgs theory, supersymmetry, and string theory. Future planned experiments are described in an attempt to verify many of the theoretical concepts discussed, including the constituents of dark matter and dark energy, the existence of the Higgs boson, and the verification of extra spatial dimensions.

Chapter 15, &quot;Teleporters and Time Machines&quot;, is about traveling through space and time using intriguing methods. Quantum mechanics is brought back into the picture when the reader comes across teleportation. Puzzles of time travel are posed, such as the idea of time travel to the past being a possibility. The end of the chapter focuses on wormholes and the theory behind them.

Chapter 16, &quot;The Future of an Allusion&quot;, focuses on black holes and their relationship to entropy. The main idea of this chapter is that spacetime may not be the fundamental makeup of the universe&#x27;s fabric.

==Reception==
&quot;The Fabric of the Cosmos&quot; became the most popular science book among Amazon.com customers in 2005 and was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list—from its publication on February 10, 2004, it appeared 10 times in the Non-Fiction top 15, peaking at number 3 on April 4, before dropping off the list on May 9. With a first printing of 125,000 and as a main selection of the Book of the Month Club, Knopf expected it to do well.

==Adaptation==
NOVA made a documentary sequel to the popular &quot;Elegant Universe&quot; adaptation based on this book &quot;The Fabric of the Cosmos&quot; and with the same name. The series is hosted by Greene and includes commentary by numerous other renowned physicists, such as Max Tegmark and others.

This documentary series is composed of 4 episodes (5–8 of season 39, 2011–2012) of the Nova television series:
# The Fabric of the Cosmos: What is Space?
# The Fabric of the Cosmos: The Illusion of Time
# The Fabric of the Cosmos: Quantum Leap
# The Fabric of the Cosmos: Universe or Multiverse?
Lynn Elber of &quot;Associated Press&quot; called it, &quot;Mind-blowing TV.&quot;

<text>Azure Ray is an American dream pop duo, consisting of musicians Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor. Formed in Athens, Georgia, in 2001, they later moved to Omaha, Nebraska, and became part of the Saddle Creek Records music scene, which also included Bright Eyes, The Faint, and Cursive. Azure Ray&#x27;s music has often been featured in film and television, including &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, and &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. They have released five albums and several EPs. 

==Biography==
===Formation===
The pair met while attending the Alabama School of Fine Arts in Birmingham. They fronted a band called Little Red Rocket, which released two albums, &quot;Who Did You Pay&quot; (1997, Tim/Kerr) and &quot;It&#x27;s in the Sound&quot; (2000, Monolyth Record Group), which earned them frequent comparisons to Veruca Salt. For the first album, the duo co-wrote with the band&#x27;s drummer Louis Schefano who would become a frequent collaborator.

After the band broke up, Fink and Taylor moved to Athens, Georgia, and eventually formed Azure Ray. &quot;My boyfriend had just died and we had written all of these songs that were helping us cope with everything. We had a night where all of our friends and family got together. We played those songs, which later would turn into the songs on our first Azure Ray record...&quot; said Taylor.

===&quot;Azure Ray&quot; (2001)===
The pair signed to the Warm Electronic Recordings label and released their self-titled debut in 2001, produced by Eric Bachmann (Crooked Fingers and Archers of Loaf). Pitchfork praised the album, giving it a 7 out of 10, describing it as a collection of &quot;maudlin but beautiful, expertly crafted pop songs&quot;. The song &quot;Sleep&quot; was later featured in the 2006 Academy Award-nominated movie &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. In February 2015, Taylor Swift included &quot;Sleep&quot; on a six-song &quot;breakup playlist&quot; made for a fan via her official Tumblr. DJ Paul Kalkbrenner also sampled &quot;Rise&quot; in his 2008 song &quot;Azure&quot;.

===&quot;Burn and Shiver&quot; and &quot;November&quot; EP (2002)===
Azure Ray&#x27;s second album, &quot;Burn and Shiver&quot;, was released in 2002, again produced by Bachmann. With &quot;Burn and Shiver&quot;, Pitchfork said the duo had &quot;come closer than ever to wielding an emotional potency like master Cohen&#x27;s&quot;. After meeting Fink and Taylor in Athens, Bright Eyes frontman Conor Oberst invited the band on tour and introduced them to the people at Saddle Creek, the label to which he was signed. They relocated to Omaha, Nebraska, and joined the music scene there. The &quot;November&quot; EP was released on January 22, 2002, and was the band&#x27;s first for Saddle Creek.

The duo collaborated with Moby and co-wrote the songs &quot;Great Escape&quot; (on his album &quot;18&quot;) and &quot;Landing&quot; (which appeared on the &quot;XXX&quot; soundtrack), and afterwards joined him on tour.

===&quot;Hold On Love&quot; (2003), &quot;New Resolution&quot; EP (2004) and hiatus===
&quot;Hold On Love&quot; was the band&#x27;s third full-length, released October 7, 2003, on Saddle Creek. Pitchfork called it a departure from their previous records, with &quot;newly arresting manipulations of electronic elements interlock[ing] with the duo&#x27;s traditional organic fare, as well as bolder and sharper production&quot;. The first single from this album, &quot;New Resolution&quot;, was released as an EP/Single by Saddle Creek on January 20, 2004. Azure Ray went on hiatus in 2004, leaving Fink and Taylor to work on solo albums and other collaborative projects, including a stint in Now It&#x27;s Overhead.

===Reunion and &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; (2010)===
Fink and Taylor reformed the band for a one-off show in Los Angeles at the iconic Troubadour on November 30, 2008, accompanied by Andy LeMaster of Now It&#x27;s Overhead and Nick White of Tilly and the Wall. In 2009, Taylor announced on KCRW&#x27;s &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot; that the duo had reformed on a semi-permanent basis, with the intention of playing &quot;five or six&quot; shows before working on a new Azure Ray album. Their fourth album, &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot;, was released in September 2010. On August 4, 2010, Stereogum premiered the first song from the album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave My Mind&quot;; they later premiered the video, directed by Ryan Berg, on September 30. Pitchfork said the new album &quot;sounds warmly familiar, a reminder of why we missed them in the first place&quot;, while a reviewer for the BBC called it &quot;a warming blanket of an album, here for you to wrap up in&quot;. On January 25, 2011, Azure Ray released a new single from the recording sessions, titled &quot;Silverlake&quot;, recorded with Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse.

===&quot;As Above, So Below&quot; EP (2012)===
Azure Ray&#x27;s next release, a six-song EP entitled &quot;As Above So Below&quot;, came out on Saddle Creek on September 5, 2012. After a two-year hiatus following the release of &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot;, Fink and a pregnant Taylor entered the studio to record six news songs with a more &quot;hypnotic&quot; &quot;electronica&quot; influence in collaboration with Andy LeMaster and Todd Fink. On July 17, Stereogum premiered &quot;Scattered Like Leaves&quot;, calling it a &quot;starry, shivering cut&quot;, while NPR premiered &quot;Red Balloon&quot; on August 9, describing it as a &quot;long, slow summer swoon&quot; with &quot;devastating melancholy&quot;. Rolling Stone premiered the full EP stream on August 28.

===Reunion and &quot;Waves&quot; EP (2018)===
In October 2017, after another hiatus, it was announced that Azure Ray&#x27;s self-titled debut and &quot;Burn and Shiver&quot; were now newly available through Taylor&#x27;s own label, Flower Moon Records. The next month, the duo announced they would once again reunite for a one-off show in Los Angeles at the Lodge Room on January 20, 2018.

On September 26, 2018, &quot;Stereogum&quot; announced the first new Azure Ray record in six years, an EP titled &quot;Waves&quot;, and premiered a new single, &quot;Palindrome&quot;, praising it as a &quot;mournful string-driven ballad which offers the best of the band&#x27;s spectral harmonies, woodsy storytelling and aching wisdom&quot;. Billboard premiered the video for &quot;Palindrome&quot;, directed by Alan Tanner, on October 19, along with a new recording of &quot;Hold On Love&quot; (from their 2003 record of the same name), which the band said &quot;reflects the live version that we came to love playing through the years&quot;. KCRW premiered the video for the &quot;hauntingly beautiful&quot; &quot;Last Summer in Omaha&quot; on October 25, the day before the EP was released on Flower Moon.

2021 saw the release of &quot;Remedy&quot;, their first new album in 11 years. Recently, the band has begun to re-release their backcatelogue via their own label Flower Moon.

==Other projects==
Fink and Taylor have both recorded and released numerous solo albums, and have performed as part of Now It&#x27;s Overhead. They have also appeared together on numerous Bright Eyes records, as well as others by Moby, Cursive, Two Gallants, and Georgie James. Fink is also a member of Art in Manila, O+S, Harouki Zombi, Closeness, and High Up, and has played with or appeared as a guest on records by The Faint, Pete Yorn, Old Canes, and others. Taylor has recorded or performed with Ben Lee, Joshua Radin, Nik Freitas, and others.

<text>Hedin is a lunar impact crater of the dimension traditionally termed a walled plain. It lies due south of the crater pair Olbers and Glushko, and northwest of the similarly dimensioned walled plain Riccioli. To the east is another walled plain, Hevelius.

This crater has a deteriorated outer rim that has been worn down and reshaped through impact erosion. Several small craters lie along or near the rim, including Hedin F to the northeast and Hedin H to the southeast.

The interior floor has been scored by the impact event that created the Mare Orientale to the southeast. But these features are cross-hatched by a pair of linear rilles that follow a path towards the southeast. Only a section of the floor along the northwest rim is relatively level, retaining the low albedo of ground that has been resurfaced by lava.

This crater is sometimes referred to as &quot;Sven Hedin&quot; in older publications.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hedin.

<text>The Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (NCN; ; formerly the Nelson House First Nation) is a Cree First Nations community centered in Nelson House, Manitoba, Canada. Its main reserve is Nelson House 170.

Nelson House is located about west of Thompson and is accessible via the mixed paved and gravel Provincial Road 391. The Cree name &quot;Nisichawayasihk&quot; means, &quot;“Where three rivers meet”&quot;. The largest community, business and government centre is located at Nelson House on the north shore of Footprint Lake at the convergence of the Burntwood, Footprint, and Rat Rivers. Smaller areas of development occur at &quot;Dog Point&quot;, &quot;R.C&quot;, &quot;Mission Point&#x27;&quot; and the &quot;New Area&quot;.

==History==
The people of Nisichawayasihk are largely ancestral descendants of indigenous Cree peoples who have populated the Canadian Shield region of northern and central Canada since the retreat of the glaciers about 10,000 years ago.

The people of Nisichawayasihk refer to themselves as the &quot;Nisichawayasi Nehethowak&quot; (Cree from where three rivers meet). The term Rocky Cree (&quot;Asiniskaw Ithiniwak&quot;- People from where there is an abundance of rocks) is also used to refer to the people of Nisichawayasihk.

During the peak of the Fur trade The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company operated a trading post in Nelson House between 1800 and 1827. Many of the Rocky Cree started travelling to the trading post selling furs and other goods.

The Nelson House outpost (&quot;also referred to at the time to as Fort Nelson&quot;), was established in 1800 on the Churchill River. Men from South Indian Lake were sent to establish a post in Nelson House and construction had begun in 1800. In 1809, the original Nelson House was abandoned and moved to an island three miles west of the old house.

In 1814, the Nelson River District &quot;(originally known as the New Churchill District)&quot; was established with Nelson House as its headquarters. It acted as such until 1819 when South Indian Lake became its headquarters. Nelson House acted as its headquarters once again in 1824. In 1827, the Nelson House Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post was closed due to poor fur returns. This caused many to have to travel to South Indian Lake in order to exchange goods with the traders.

Largely left alone by the Government of Canada during initial colonization and settlement of Western Canada. In the mid-1870s, the Indigenous peoples of the Lake Winnipeg area were interested in making a treaty with the Government of Canada. They had heard about the concessions offered to the Indigenous nations of Treaties 1 to 4, and subsequently demanded the government provide similar economic assistance, provisions of tools and protection against the encroachment of outsiders (such as surveyors and settlers) on their territories. Treaty 5 was the response from the government that ensure the homelands of the Cree were protected for their use. Treaty 5, a document which established that Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation members and their descendants were guaranteed certain rights and benefits.

==Governance and population==
Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation is governed by an elected chief and council. Elections are held pursuant to NCN&#x27;s own democratic election code.

About 3,000 members of the NCN live in Nelson House and the remaining 2,100 off the reserve lands. Until 2005, the community of South Indian Lake on the shores of Southern Indian Lake was also part of the NCN. In December 2005, this community of about 1,100 persons separated from the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation to form the O-Pipon-Na-Piwin Cree Nation.

With a population of approximately 5,200, the NCN is a large and widespread community. Nelson House consists of eleven areas, which are known to the residents as Westwood, School Road, Hillside, Dogpoint, R.C. Point &quot;(Named after the Roman Catholic church in the area)&quot;, Little R.C. Point, New Area, Hart&#x27;s Point, Michelle Point, Bay Road and Moore&#x27;s Bay.

Drinking water is drawn from Footprint Lake, treated, and delivered by pipe to about 50% of the community (primarily those who live closer to the main community) with the remainder of residents serviced by five water trucks.
The nursing station, elementary school, teacherages and the Three Rivers Store use water delivery trucks and a piped system to obtain treated water.

==Hydroelectric development and impacts==
During the 1960s and 1970s, the Government of Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro began the Nelson River Hydroelectric Project, centered on the Churchill and Nelson rivers. The project included the Churchill River Diversion, which directly affected Nisichawayasihk members living at Nelson House and at South Indian Lake. Consequently, large areas of traditional hunting, fishing and trapping lands were flooded. The people of South Indian Lake were forcibly relocated to their current location.

The Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (NCN) is a signatory to the Northern Flood Agreement (NFA) between Canada (the federal government), Manitoba Hydro, the province of Manitoba and several First Nations Communities. In 1996, NCN signed an NFA Implementation Agreement. Using settlement proceeds paid pursuant to this implementation agreement, NCN purchased the Mystery Lake Motor Hotel in the nearby city of Thompson. In 2006, the NCN signed a Project Development Agreement with Manitoba Hydro regarding the Wuskwatim hydroelectric project on the Burntwood River, about 30 km from Nelson House. Wuskwatim generates about 200 MW of electricity. The NCN was involved in the construction of the project and, as a partner in the project, will receive a share of the future revenues. This arrangement is the first of its kind in Manitoba.

In 2006, the Atoskiwin Training and Employment Centre (ATEC) opened its doors in Nelson House. ATEC is also a Manitoba first. It trains NCN members and other aboriginals for northern hydro projects and other job opportunities.

==Reserve lands==
Nelson House consists of four NCN reserves, totalling in size:

* Nelson House 170 — located on the north shore of Footprint Lake; totalling in size
* Nelson House 170A — located south of the west end of Footprint Lake; totalling in size
* Nelson House 170B — located south of the central part of Footprint Lake; totalling in size
* Nelson House 170C — located on the north-east shore of Footprint Lake; totalling in size

===Urban reserve===
In early February 2004, the nearby city of Thompson, Manitoba, announced its approval to the NCN to convert a parcel of property to reserve land. This was possible due to shortages in land area controlled by NCN under the &quot;Treaty Land Entitlement&quot; agreement in the mid-1990s. This event marked one of the few transitions from privately owned land, purchased by a First Nations community, to an urban reserve.

This plan was quietly discussed between city and band administration since the narrowly-lost plebiscite held in Thompson on 18 September 2001. With a 45% voter turnout for the plebiscite, and amid allegations of inappropriate voter disqualifications, the &quot;no&quot; side won by a margin of 250 votes. During the three years following the plebiscite, the majority of Thompson City Councillors publicly stated that the results of the vote were not binding upon city council, as the council was elected to act in the best interests of the citizens of Thompson.

Thompson City Council approved NCN&#x27;s plan for the urban reserve on 7 February 2005.

In April 2016, the reserve received an additional of land.

<text>Frederic Bancroft (October 30, 1860, in Galesburg, Illinois – February 22, 1945) was an American historian, author, and librarian. The Bancroft Prize, one of the most distinguished academic awards in the field of history, was established at Columbia University in his memory and that of his brother, Edgar Bancroft.

==Biography==
Bancroft was born in Galesburg, Illinois, and graduated with an A.B. from Amherst College and a PhD from Columbia University. He was a lecturer for one year at Columbia, and served as librarian of the State Department from 1888 to 1892.

Bancroft was an active member of the American Historical Association, and was the unofficial leader of a group from 1913–1915 that called for the reform of the organization&#x27;s election procedures, ultimately securing such reforms at the 1915 meeting although failing to topple what he viewed as the oligarchy led by J. Franklin Jameson.

Bancroft was the author of two well-regarded books on the South, &quot;Slave Trading in the Old South&quot; in 1931 and &quot;A Sketch of the Negro in Politics, Especially in South Carolina and Mississippi&quot; in 1885. In 1900, he also wrote a biography of William H. Seward.

Through his bequest, in 1948 the Bancroft Prize was established at Columbia University in his memory and that of his brother, diplomat and attorney Edgar Bancroft. It is considered one of the most distinguished academic awards in the field of history.

<doc id="1247302" wikidata="Q6517846" url="?curid=1247302" title="List of legendary rulers of Cornwall">
<text>&quot;Duke of Cornwall&quot; appears as a title in pseudo-historical authors such as Geoffrey of Monmouth. The list is patchy and not every succession was unbroken. Indeed, Geoffrey repeatedly introduces Dukes of Cornwall only to promote them to the Kingship of the Britons and thus put an end to their line as (merely) dukes. As adjuncts or supporting roles to the kings of the Britons, the legendary dukes of Cornwall are considered part of the vast Matter of Britain, and can also be found in other stories, such as &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, &quot;Havelok the Dane&quot;, and &quot;Gesta Herewardi&quot;. Antiquaries such as Richard Carew (&quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot;, 1602) and John Williams (the &quot;Book of Baglan&quot;, 1600–1607) also provide lists of legendary rulers of Cornwall, often combining the above with other sources.

As a result, these lists are more often thought of as a conglomeration of various Celtic rulers, Celtic warlords, and mythical heroes. If the lists of kings of Britain are legendary, then the list of dukes must be considered still more a genealogical and historical legend with no solid basis in the view of most historians. The titles given for the rulers also vary, even within sources; Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;History&quot;, has the title fluctuating between &quot;duke&quot; (&quot;dux Cornubiae&quot;) and &quot;king&quot; (&quot;rex Cornubiae&quot;), and Carew wrote that before the Norman Conquest &quot;these titles of honour carry a kinde of confusednes, and rather betokened a successive office, then an established dignity. The following ages received a more distinct forme, and left us a certeyner notice.&quot;

==Pre-Arthurian==
==Arthurian==
Sources diverge leading up to the time of King Arthur, with Caradoc placed either during the time of Arthur (as in the Welsh Triads, and later tradition), soon before Gorlois (Carew&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot;), or before his brother Dionotus as Caradocus in the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, while the &quot;Book of Baglan&quot; only keeps Gorlois, but gives him an entirely different set of ancestors. Gorlois is sometimes given other names, such as Ricca in &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;, Tador in William Worcester&#x27;s &quot;Itineraries&quot;, and Hoel in the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot;. In some sources Gorlois is not ruler of Cornwall, and is replaced in this role by Mark in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, Ydiers in the Prose &quot;Merlin&quot;, and the unnamed King Cornwall in &quot;King Arthur and King Cornwall&quot;.

<doc id="1247306" wikidata="Q5440118" url="?curid=1247306" title="Federal Correctional Institution, Florence">
<text>The Federal Correctional Institution, Florence (FCI Florence) is a medium-security United States federal prison for male inmates in Colorado. Part of the Florence Federal Correctional Complex (FCC Florence), it is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, a division of the United States Department of Justice.

FCI Florence is located in an unincorporated area in Fremont County, outside the city of Florence, Colorado, south of Denver, south of Colorado Springs, and west of Pueblo.

==Notable incidents==
 On the morning hours of December 29, 2008, correction officers at FCI Florence found inmate Pablo Zúñiga-García, 33, dead in his cell. Zúñiga-García (95492-198), who was serving a 54-month sentence for an illegal-immigration conviction, had suffered numerous blunt-force injuries to his head. A subsequent FBI investigation found that inmates José Augustín Pluma, Juan Martín Ruelas, Mark Rosález, and Justin Hernández, all inmates at FCI Florence and members of the Sureños gang, orchestrated the assault.

Prior to the fatal assault, Hernández, a Sureños leader, ordered several other inmates to physically assault Zúñiga-García. Hernández&#x27;s lieutenant, Rosález, asked another inmate to act as a lookout during the assault and prevent Zúñiga-García from escaping. During the early hours of December 29, 2008, Pluma and three of the unnamed co-conspirators entered the cell with their makeshift weapons, padlocks attached to belts, and began a 15-minute beating of Zúñiga-García while Ruelas and another unnamed co-conspirator took their places as lookouts. Three other participants pleaded to lesser charges and agreed to testify against the four men.

<text>Mee is a lunar impact crater in the southwestern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. Overlying the northwestern rim and intruding one-third the distance across the interior floor is Hainzel, a merged triple-crater formation. To the south is the highly elongated crater Schiller. Mee is 132 kilometers in diameter and 2.7 kilometers deep. It is from the Pre-Nectarian period, 4.55 to 3.92 billion years ago.

This is an old crater formation with an outer rim that has been heavily eroded by subsequent impacts, leaving an irregular impression of the crater rim. The inner wall is notched an indented by multiple small craters, with the most recent being Mee F along the northwestern side. Portions of the interior are relatively level, and there is a palimpsest, Mee E, in the northwestern part of the floor. A tiny crater with a high albedo halo is located in the eastern part of the floor.

The crater is named after the 19th-century Scottish astronomer Arthur Butler Phillips Mee.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Mee.

<text>Lindley Miller Garrison (November 28, 1864 – October 19, 1932) was an American lawyer from New Jersey who served as Secretary of War under U.S. President Woodrow Wilson between 1913 and 1916.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Lindley Miller Garrison was born in Camden, New Jersey, the son of the Reverend Joseph Fithian Garrison (1823–1892) and Elizabeth Vanarsdale (Grant) Garrison (1829–1903). His brother was Charles G. Garrison, an associate justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court He attended public schools and the Protestant Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He studied at Phillips Exeter Academy for one year before attending Harvard University as a special student from 1884 to 1885. He studied law in the office of Redding, Jones &amp; Carson of Philadelphia, received a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania, and was admitted to the bar in 1886. He practiced law in Camden from 1888 to 1898 and became a partner in the firm of Garrison, McManus &amp; Enright in Jersey City in 1899. He married Margaret Hildeburn in Jersey City on 30 June 1899. Garrison served as vice-chancellor of New Jersey from 1904 to 1913, where he came to Governor Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s notice.

===Secretary of War===
From March 5, 1913 to February 10, 1916, Garrison served as Secretary of War in the Wilson administration. Garrison and Wilson never fit well together. Garrison was much more willing to intervene militarily overseas than was the President. This was especially evident in regard to Mexico. Garrison urged American intervention into the Mexican revolution to restore order. During the Preparedness campaign of 1916, when Wilson was trying to convince Congress to raise military spending, Garrison supported a plan for expanding the US military with what he called the Continental Army Plan. Garrison&#x27;s proposal would establish a standing army of 140,000 and a national, volunteer reserve force of 400,000 men. Wilson initially gave the plan tepid support, but Garrison ran into opposition from both those who felt his plan went too far in creating a large standing army, as well as from those who felt it did not go far enough. Wilson was convinced by allies in Congress to back an alternative plan which emphasized not Garrison&#x27;s national volunteer force, but a continued role for the states&#x27; National Guard. Garrison resigned in February 1916 over these differences.

===Later years===

After leaving Wilson&#x27;s administration Garrison returned to the practice of law in the firm of Hornblower, Miller &amp; Garrison (now Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP). He was appointed receiver of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company in December 1918 and served until June 1923. His wife Margaret died in Manhattan in 1926. He died on October 19, 1932, at his home in Sea Bright, New Jersey.

<text>The parakeet auklet (Aethia psittacula) is a small seabird of the North Pacific. Parakeet Auklets used to be placed on its own in the genus &quot;Cyclorrhynchus&quot; (Kaup, 1829) but recent morphological and genetic evidence suggest it should be placed in the genus &quot;Aethia&quot;, making them closely related to crested auklets and least auklets. It is associated with the boreal waters of Alaska, Kamchatka and Siberia. It breeds on the cliffs, slopes and boulder fields of offshore islands, generally moving south during the winter.

==Description==
The parakeet auklet is a small (23 cm) auk with a short orange bill that is upturned to give the bird its curious fixed expression. The upward bend of the beak has been observed to provide advantages in picking up small food pieces from the sea bottom as well as in assisting in the disintegration of larger food objects. The bird&#x27;s plumage is dark above and white below. with a single white plume projecting back from the eye. There is a small amount of variation between breeding and winter plumage.

The parakeet auklet is a highly vocal species at the nest, calling once it arrives at the nest and then duetting once its mate arrives. It makes a series of rhythmic hoarse calls (like that of the Cassin&#x27;s auklet) and a quavering squeal. The function of these are unknown, but could be associated with defending its burrow from intruders and strengthening the bond with its mate.

== Taxonomy ==
The Parakeet Auklet was formerly included in the genus Cyclorrhynchus, avians with a nearly circular profile of the bill. But following recent phylogenetic study, this species could be closer to the Crested Auklet, Least Auklet and Whiskered Auklet.

==Behaviour and breeding==

The parakeet auklet&#x27;s food varies with season, during the breeding season it takes mostly small planktonic crustaceans such as euphausiids, copepods and amphipods. Recent research shows it also preys on jellyfish in some areas. It often feeds at a considerable distance from the colony, diving up to 30 m to reach its prey.

Breeding begins in April and May in colonies that are often shared with other auk species. Their eggs are laid in the crevices of the cliff, often several feet in and by a crooked path so that it is impossible to reach them. The pair lay one egg, which is incubated for just over a month, the chick is then fed 4 times a day for around 35 days. The chick fledges at night, flying out to sea alone.

== Relationship with humans ==
The parakeet auklet has little contact with humans despite its large population, this is largely due to their remote breeding and wintering. However, the parakeet auklet still faces issues caused by marine pollution and ingestion of small plastics.

== Status and conservation ==

The parakeet auklet is not considered threatened, there are estimated to be over a million individuals in the North Pacific. It is not thought to have declined recently, but may be threatened in the future by introduced predators and oil spills.

<text>Kamehameha Highway is one of the main highways serving suburban and rural O‘ahu in the U.S. state of Hawai‘i. Informally known as Kam Highway, it begins at Nimitz Highway near Pearl Harbor and Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu, serves the island&#x27;s older western suburbs, and turns north across the O‘ahu Central Valley to the North Shore. At the North Shore, Kamehameha Highway heads northeast around the northern tip of O‘ahu, then southeast to and just beyond Kāne‘ohe Bay on the windward coast. The road was named after King Kamehameha I.

A short detached segment of the Kamehameha Highway exists for a few blocks in the Honolulu neighborhood of Kalihi. This segment runs as a short extension of Dillingham Boulevard from Pu‘uhale Road (near the O‘ahu Community Correctional Center) to exit 18B on Interstate H-1. This section was contiguous with the rest of the highway before the construction of the H-1 viaduct.

==Route description==

===Route 99 (Honolulu to Hale‘iwa)===

As Route 99, Kamehameha Highway begins at its southern terminus at the Pearl Harbor interchange of Interstate H-1 near Pearl Harbor and Hickam Air Force Base. The highway runs north past the Pearl Harbor historic sites such as the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial and the , the Admiral Clarey Bridge to Ford Island leading to the , and Aloha Stadium. The highway then turns west through the suburbs of ‘Aiea and Pearl City, passing Pearlridge Center, the state&#x27;s second largest shopping mall.

After passing Pearl City and the interchange with Interstate H-2 near Waipahu, Route 99 turns north through the central O‘ahu suburbs of Waipi‘o and Mililani. South of Wahiawā near Wheeler Army Airfield, the named Kamehameha Highway continues through Wahiawā as Route 80, while Route 99 (as Wilikina Drive and Kamananui Road) bypasses Wahiawā on the west, rejoining Kamehameha Highway north of Whitmore Village. It then continues north through pineapple fields and former sugar cane fields to the junction with Route 83 near Hale‘iwa.

===Route 80 (Wahiawā)===
As Route 80, Kamehameha Highway begins at the interchange with Interstate H-2 and Route 99 and passes through central Wahiawā and passing Whitmore Village before rejoining Route 99 north of Wahiawā.

===Route 83 (Hale‘iwa to Kāne‘ohe)===

Originally, Kamehameha Highway continued as Route 83 at the junction with Route 99 at Weed Junction in Hale‘iwa, passing through Hale‘iwa up the North Shore. Since 1995, Route 83 begins inland from Weed Junction as the Joseph P. Leong Highway and bypasses Hale‘iwa town on the inland side, rejoining Kamehameha Highway north of Hale‘iwa.

From Hale‘iwa, Kamehameha Highway passes Waimea Bay, Sunset Beach, and the Turtle Bay Resort at the northern tip of O‘ahu before heading down the Windward Coast communities of Lā‘ie, Hau‘ula, Punalu‘u, and Ka‘a‘awa.

At Kahalu‘u, Kamehameha Highway follows the coastline through He‘eia and the main commercial district of Kāne‘ohe (this segment was formerly Route 836), while Route 83 continues as Kahekili Highway bypassing Kāne‘ohe town to the west before reaching the junction with Likelike Highway (Route 63). Route 83 rejoins Kamehameha Highway in Kāne‘ohe and continues south to the interchange with Interstate H-3 and the eastern terminus at Route 61.

===Route 830===

Hawaii Route 830 is a north–south route on the island of O‘ahu, Hawai‘i. Its northern terminus is with Route 83, near Kahalu‘u. It then continues southward along the shore of the Kāne‘ohe Bay, until its southern terminus with Routes 63 and 83, only 1.5 miles away from Interstate H-3.

<text>There are fifteen universities based in Scotland, the Open University, and three other institutions of higher education.

The first university in Scotland was St John&#x27;s College, St Andrews, founded in 1418. St Salvator&#x27;s College was added to St. Andrews in 1450. The other great bishoprics followed, with the University of Glasgow being founded in 1451 and King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen in 1495. St Leonard&#x27;s College was founded in Aberdeen in 1511 and St John&#x27;s College was re-founded in 1538 as St Mary&#x27;s College, St Andrews. Public lectures that were established in Edinburgh in the 1540s would eventually become the University of Edinburgh in 1582. A university briefly existed in Fraserburgh between 1592 and 1605. In 1641, the two colleges at Aberdeen were united by decree of Charles I (r. 1625–49), to form the ‘King Charles University of Aberdeen’. They were demerged after the Restoration in 1661. In 1747 St Leonard&#x27;s College in St Andrews was merged into St Salvator&#x27;s College to form the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard. A new college of St Andrews was opened in Dundee in 1883, though initially an independent institution. The two colleges at Aberdeen were considered too small to be viable and they were restructured as the University of Aberdeen in 1860. Marischal College was rebuilt in the Gothic style from 1900. The University of Edinburgh was taken out of the care of the city and established on a similar basis to the other ancient universities.

After the Robbins Report of 1963 there was a rapid expansion in higher education in Scotland. By the end of the decade the number of Scottish Universities had doubled. New universities included the University of Dundee, Strathclyde, Heriot-Watt, and Stirling. From the 1970s the government preferred to expand higher education in the non-university sector and by the late 1980s roughly half of students in higher education were in colleges. In 1992, the distinction between universities and polytechnic colleges/Central institutions was removed. This created new universities at Abertay, Glasgow Caledonian, Napier, Paisley and Robert Gordon. in 2001 the University of the Highlands and Islands was created by a federation of 13 colleges and research institutions in the Highlands and Islands and gained full university status in 2011.

<doc id="1247329" wikidata="Q2750139" url="?curid=1247329" title="Skinner's Sense of Snow">
<text>&quot;Skinner&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; is the eighth episode of the twelfth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on Fox in the United States on December 17, 2000.

&quot;Skinner&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; was written by Tim Long and directed by Lance Kramer. While the episode&#x27;s premise is based on an occurrence in Long&#x27;s childhood, the setpiece came from staff writer Matt Selman. Because the episode takes place in winter, Kramer found it difficult to animate. It features references to &quot;Smilla&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot;, &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; and Kristi Yamaguchi, among other things.

In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 8.8 million viewers, finishing in 33rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following the home video release, the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
While the Simpson family attends a French Canadian circus called &quot;Cirque de Purée&quot;, a violent thunderstorm strikes Springfield and forces an early end to the performance. The storm turns into a snow squall overnight, leading to the closure of nearly every local school and business. Springfield Elementary School remains open, but only a few students and faculty members show up since it is the day before Christmas break. To pass the time, Principal Skinner plays a long, low-budget, poor-quality Christmas film for the children. When class lets out at the end of the day, they discover that they are now trapped in the building by the snow blocking the doors and windows.

With the school&#x27;s telephone service knocked out by the storm, Skinner tries to keep control over the children and begins to ration the available food. Skinner says the Pink Floyd reference from Another Brick In The Wall “If you don’t eat your relish, you’re not getting any mayonnaise!” Relish and mayonnaise is a parody of meat and pudding. After Nelson tries and fails to escape, Skinner looks through his footlocker of memorabilia from his United States Army service and remembers when he was able to command respect from his subordinates. Hanging Nelson by his vest on a coat hook, Skinner threatens to do the same to the other children and briefly frightens them into submission. However, Bart defies Skinner and tries to tunnel his way out; Skinner stops him, but ends up half-buried in snow when the tunnel caves in. The children take Skinner captive and begin to run amok throughout the school.

Meanwhile, Homer and Ned decide to rescue the children, clearing the roads with an improvised snowplow built by attaching a section of Ned&#x27;s roof to the front end of his car. The car skids out of control and crashes into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes it in place. Homer attempts to break them loose by gunning the engine, with no success, and the car fills with carbon monoxide that causes both men to hallucinate wildly. After enduring so much humiliation from the children, Skinner sends out a call for help by slipping a note inside the exercise ball of the school hamster, Nibbles, and pushing the animal out a window. Nibbles finds his way to Homer and Ned, jolting them back to reality and alerting them to the situation. They break the car free of the frozen hydrant and speed toward the school, but again lose control and crash into a silo filled with salt on the grounds of a cracker factory. The salt spills out and melts the snow around the school, freeing Skinner and the children. Superintendent Chalmers arrives unexpectedly, ready to fire Skinner over the crisis, but is mollified by a remorseful Bart&#x27;s claim that there is a good explanation for it and does not ask for any details; Skinner thanks Bart for saving his job after the mess they were in. The episode closes with Lisa turning into a camel - the product of a fresh round of Homer&#x27;s hallucinations - and wishing the viewer a merry Christmas.

==Production==

&quot;Skinner&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; was written by Tim Long and directed by Lance Kramer. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on December 17, 2000. The idea for the episode came from Long. One winter during his childhood, Exeter, Ontario, where Long lived, was hit by a blizzard. Much to his dismay, Long found out that all schools except Exeter Public School, which he went to, got closed (in the U.S., schools are closed entirely at the county or district level, so the real-life situation did not apply here, as it was shown Principal Skinner had the authority to open the school and even to have Otto work his usual bus route). Eventually, Long and his classmates were snowed in with the school&#x27;s staff. &quot;It was hellish, but then became a sweet thing&quot;, he said. &quot;A couple of the dads braved the cold and brought us food on snowmobiles. So it was sweet.&quot; Two years after Long pitched the premise, staff writer Matt Selman pitched the episode&#x27;s setpiece, which revolves around the Simpsons&#x27; visit to Cirque du Purée. &quot;I pitched [the setpiece] to Tim [Long] when we were pitching around ideas&quot;, Selman said in the episode&#x27;s DVD commentary. &quot;And I said, &#x27;What about a Cirque du Soleil parody?&#x27;&quot; The staff then decided to combine the two stories, and production on &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; ensued.

In order to make a faithful rendition of the circus, director Kramer asked the animators to watch a showing of Cirque du Soleil in Santa Monica, but they declined the offer. Regardless, executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully found that the animators did an &quot;amazing&quot; job animating the setpiece. Because the episode takes place in winter, the animators faced some challenges that they would not have with any other episode. &quot;It just adds another element&quot;, Kramer said about episodes taking place in winter, &quot;People&#x27;s clothes have to get tugged in the wind if it&#x27;s windy. And you have to make sure the snow is consistent because [...] It&#x27;s like a character. If it&#x27;s a big snowflake in one scene and then tiny ones where it&#x27;s snowing too hard in the next scene... It&#x27;s not gonna work.&quot; The scratches and bad quality of &quot;The Christmas That Almost Wasn&#x27;t, But Then Was&quot; were added in by the Post-Production Department, led by Alex Duke. &quot;Our Post-Production Department never gets enough credit,&quot; Scully said, &quot;But they&#x27;ll take a film like [&#x27;The Christmas That Almost Wasn&#x27;t, But Then Was&#x27;] and make it all scratchy and make it look really old. They always do a great job.&quot; The woman in &quot;The Christmas That Almost Wasn&#x27;t, But Then Was&quot; was portrayed by Tress MacNeille, while the clown in the Cirque du Purée was voiced by Hank Azaria. The song that plays when Homer and Ned are driving to the school is &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot; by English rock band Bad Company, which Homer claims to have written &quot;as a tribute to Princess Di and Dodi&quot;. Originally, the series&#x27; staff wanted to use &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; by American rock band Kiss, but they failed to obtain the rights to use it.

==Cultural references==
Although the episode&#x27;s title is a reference to the Danish mystery novel &quot;Smilla&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot;, there are no other allusions to the book in the episode. In the episode&#x27;s set piece, the Simpsons visit a circus called Cirque du Purée. The circus is a reference to the Canadian entertainment company Cirque du Soleil. The film the students watch, &quot;The Christmas That Almost Wasn&#x27;t, But Then Was&quot; (the title of which is a reference to the 1966 film &quot;The Christmas That Almost Wasn&#x27;t&quot;), is a reference to B-Grade 50s and 60s themed Christmas movies such as &quot;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians&quot;. Within the film, one of the hobgoblins has a similar singing voice as American singer Nelson Eddy. Having just found out that they are trapped in the school, Skinner says, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re Kristi Yamaguchi - no one leaves the building&quot;. According to Long, the line was written by either Dana Gould or George Meyer, both of whom are former staff writers. While wreaking havoc in the school, Milhouse can be seen doodling mustaches on pictures of Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding, the 28th and 29th Presidents of the United States, respectively. Milhouse was also about to draw a moustache on 27th President William Howard Taft until noticing that he already had a moustache. While ordering Skinner to humiliate himself, Bart says &quot;Di, di, mau&quot;. This is a reference to the 1978 drama film &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;, in which the Vietcong says the line to their captives. One of the books that the children burn in the school&#x27;s library is the 1944 children&#x27;s novel &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; by Esther Forbes.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast on December 17, 2000, &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; received an 8.7 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 8.8 million viewers. The episode finished in 33rd place in the ratings for the week of December 11-17, 2000, tying with an episode of the ABC sitcom &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;.

Since its broadcast, the episode has been released twice on home video. On November 2, 2004, it was released along with &quot;Homer vs. Dignity&quot;, &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Ranch?&quot; and &#x27;Tis the Fifteenth Season&quot; as part of a DVD set entitled &quot;The Simpsons - Christmas 2&quot;. On August 18, 2009, the episode was again released as part of a DVD set called &quot;The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season&quot;. Matt Groening, Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Tim Long, Matt Selman, David Mirkin, Max Pross and Lance Kramer participated in the audio commentary for the episode.

Following its home video release, &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics.

In his review of &quot;The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season&quot;, DVD Verdict&#x27;s Mac McEntire wrote that, while he prefers &quot;down-to-Earth&quot; episodes, the more &quot;outrageous&quot; episodes like &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; are the ones that are &quot;standouts&quot;. He added that the episode &quot;provides a lot of solid &#x27;cool kids versus dorky adults&#x27; comedy&quot;, and that the setpiece was the best part of the episode.

Matt Haigh of Den of Geek described the episode as &quot;gold&quot;, and considers it to be one of the season&#x27;s best episodes.

The staff of &quot;The Journal&quot;, while reviewing &quot;The Simpsons - Christmas 2&quot; DVD set, described the episode as &quot;memorable&quot;, and John McMurtrie of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; cited it as &quot;great&quot;.

Elizabeth Skipper, another reviewer for DVD Verdict, wrote that most episodes that center around Skinner are &quot;a sure thing&quot;, and that &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; is no exception.

Both Aaron Beierle and Jason Bailey of DVD Talk argued that &quot;Skinner&#x27;s Sense of Snow&quot; is one of the best episodes of the season.

However, giving the episode a mixed review, Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide described the episode as &quot;mediocre&quot;. Although he found the children&#x27;s revolt against Skinner amusing, he argued that the premise was not used to its full potential. He concluded his review by calling it &quot;a fairly average program&quot;.

<text>Sikorsky is a crater on the far side of the Moon. It is situated behind the southeastern limb of the Moon, just out of sight from the Earth. It lies to the northwest of the huge walled plain Schrödinger. To the northwest is the smaller crater Moulton.

In 1967 the Lunar Orbiter 4 photographed this region in high resolution, discovering a 310-km-long gouge cutting through the middle of Sikorsky. This linear formation is radial to Schrödinger and has since been named the Vallis Schrödinger.

This is a heavily eroded crater formation with a rim that has been worn and rounded by a long history of lesser impacts. In addition to the wide valley mentioned above, there is a lesser cleft that cuts into the eastern rim from the south-southeast. There are also small craterlets along the rim to the east, northeast, and northwest.

Discounting the valley that bisects the floor, the interior surface is relatively level and featureless, with only a few tiny craterlets to mark the surface. At nearly the exact midpoint of the floor, and intruding into the western side of the Vallis Schrödinger, is the almost perfectly bowl-shaped satellite crater Sikorsky Q.

The crater is named after Igor Sikorsky, a Russian-American aviation pioneer.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Sikorsky.

<doc id="1247334" wikidata="Q6398218" url="?curid=1247334" title="Brassard">
<text>A brassard or armlet is an armband or piece of cloth or other material worn around the upper arm; the term typically refers to an item of uniform worn as part of military uniform or by police or other uniformed persons. Unit, role, rank badges or other insignia are carried on it instead of being stitched into the actual clothing. The brassard, when spread out, may be roughly rectangular in shape, where it is worn merely around the arm; it may also be a roughly triangular shape, in which case the brassard is also attached to a shoulder strap. The term is originally French, deriving from &quot;bras&quot; meaning &quot;arm&quot;.

Brassards are also used with the uniforms of organizations which are not military, but which are influenced by and styled upon the military, such as police, emergency services, volunteer services, or militaristic societies and political parties.

== Use ==
A brassard is often used:
* to temporarily attach insignia, such as rank, to clothing not normally bearing insignia (such as civilian clothing or a military mechanic&#x27;s coveralls); For example, when French police officers work in plainclothes or are off-duty and carrying a firearm, they must wear a red &#x27;Police&#x27; brassard.
* to temporarily attach insignia to a uniform for a limited time, such as the insignia for an &quot;officer of the day&quot; or &quot;duty officer&quot;; or for uniforms expected to have a high turnover of either wearer or insignia borne, such as those of cadets or members of other youth organizations. Brassards worn by Red Cross personnel fall under this category. Brassards are often used in this manner by military police, the brassard being both a badge of authority and identification.

Brassard (also &quot;brassart&quot; or &quot;brasset&quot;) is also used to refer to pieces of armour worn to cover the entire arm (encompassing vambrace, rerebrace, and possibly a couter).

<text>Crüger is a lunar impact crater that is located in the western part of the Moon, to the northeast of the much larger walled plain Darwin.

The most distinctive feature about this crater is very dark interior floor that is one of the lowest albedo features on the Moon. The surface has been covered in basaltic lava and has only been exposed to a minimal amount of deposition from impact ejecta. The floor is nearly featureless, with crater of 2.5 km diameter near the center and few other even more diminutive impacts. The outer rim is low and nearly circular, and has not been significantly reshaped by impacts.

Crüger is a crater of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Crüger.

<doc id="1247347" wikidata="Q7295373" url="?curid=1247347" title="Rat-catcher">
<text>A rat-catcher is a person who kills or captures rats as a professional form of pest control. Keeping the rat population under control was practiced in Europe to prevent the spread of diseases, most notoriously the Black Death, and to prevent damage to food supplies. In modern developed countries, such a professional is otherwise known as a pest control operative or pest exterminator.

==Anecdotal history==

A famous rat-catcher from Victorian England was Jack Black, who is known through Henry Mayhew&#x27;s interview for &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot;.

== Techniques ==
Rat-catchers may attempt to capture rats themselves, or release &quot;&quot;, animals trained or naturally skilled at catching them. They may also set a rat trap or other traps.

Modern methods of rat control include traps, poisoned bait, introducing predators, reducing litter, smoke machines, and clearing of current or potential nest sites.

===Ratters===
A &quot;ratter&quot; usually refers to a dog used for catching or killing rats. This includes specially-bred terriers for vermin-hunting, which may be known as rat terriers, although the latter may refer to a breed that was historically developed in rat-baiting.

===Conditions and risks===
Rats are rarely seen in the open, preferring to hide in holes, haystacks and dark locations. A rat-catcher&#x27;s risk of being bitten is high, as is the risk of acquiring a disease from a rat bite.

==Gallery==
==In popular culture==
===Folklore===
* A famous fictional rat-catcher was the Pied Piper of Hamelin; different versions of his story have been adapted into a variety of media works.

===Comic books===
* In the DC Comics Universe, one of Batman&#x27;s enemies is the Rat Catcher, alias Otis Flannegan, who was employed as a real rat-catcher for Gotham City. The Rat Catcher occasionally orchestrates rat plagues using his uncanny ability to control rats.

===Film===
* Rat catchers make a major appearance in Dario Argento&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1998 film).
* &quot;Ratcatcher&quot; (1999), written and directed by Lynne Ramsay, is her debut feature film.

===Television===
* Colin &quot;Chopper&quot; Mozart, rat-catcher, was featured in an episode of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;
* The character Charlie Kelly from &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; was responsible for catching and exterminating rats at Paddy’s Pub.

===Literature===
* Rat-catchers appear in George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; (1860).
* British author Roald Dahl&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Ratcatcher&quot;, was collected in &quot;Someone Like You&quot; (1953).
* Serafina, the Chief Rat Catcher of the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, N.C. Serafina is a fictional character created by author Robert Beatty and was first introduced in &quot;Serafina and the Black Cloak&quot;, a spooky, historical fiction novel. Serafina&#x27;s mysterious adventures grew into a trilogy (&quot;Book 2: Serafina and the Twisted Staff&quot;, &quot;Book 3: Serafina and the Splintered Heart&quot;) and the fourth book in the series is due for release in summer 2019.

===Music===
* The humorous ballad &quot;The Famous Rat-Catcher&quot; (c. 1615)--sometimes referenced by the first line, &quot;There was a rare rat-catcher&quot;—evokes both the material culture of contemporary ratting and the verminous conduct of a particular practitioner. A fellow rat-catcher also carries treatments for venereal disease; it is not clear from either the song or the editor&#x27;s commentary whether this was a common part of the rat-catching trade.

<text>The J. Geils Band is the self-titled debut studio album by American rock band The J. Geils Band. The album was released on November 16, 1970, by Atlantic Records.

==Critical reception==
The band had once been known as the J. Geils Blues Band, but its debut album revealed the stylistic range it had long developed. In an effusive contemporary review, a journalist for rock magazine &quot;Creem&quot; praised the diversity and wrote: &quot;It could be called blues, it could be called R&amp;B, it could be called rock and roll; I prefer to call it good energetic music and leave it at that. They spent their formative years absorbing the best of all these musics and the sound they have distilled is truly their own.&quot;

==Track listing==

Juke Joint Jimmy is a pseudonym used by The J. Geils Band for group compositions.

==Personnel==
===The J. Geils Band===
* Peter Wolf – lead vocals
* J. Geils – guitar
* Magic Dick – harmonica
* Seth Justman – piano, organ

<text>South is a large lunar impact crater that is located in the northwest part of the Moon. Most of the southern wall of this crater is joined to the Sinus Roris bay of the Oceanus Procellarum, with the southeast rim facing Mare Frigoris. Attached to the northwest of the formation is the larger walled plain Babbage. Just to the northeast is the crater Robinson, and farther to the northeast is another walled plain, J. Herschel.

Little remains of South&#x27;s original rim, which is now just a disintegrated ring of low ridges. The most prominent surviving section lies to the northwest, while the southern half of the rim barely exists as low rises in the surface.

The interior floor of South has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, and is relatively level with no prominent features. The floor is pock-marked by many tiny craterlets, especially in the southern half. Several small craterlets lie along the remnant of the southern and southwestern rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to South.

<text>The Uniform Law Commission (ULC), also called the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, is a non-profit, American unincorporated association. Established in 1892, the ULC aims to provide U.S. states (plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) with well-researched and drafted model acts to bring clarity and stability to critical areas of statutory law across jurisdictions. The ULC promotes enactment of uniform acts in areas of state law where uniformity is desirable and practical. The ULC headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois.

The ULC is best known for its work on the landmark Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), drafted in conjunction with the American Law Institute.

Since the ULC first convened in 1892, it has produced more than 450 uniform acts. These acts focus on commercial law, family and domestic relations law, estates, probate and trusts, real estate, alternate dispute resolution, and many other areas of the law. Among the ULC&#x27;s most widely adopted acts are the Uniform Commercial Code, the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, and the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act.

== Commission ==
The ULC consists of approximately 350 commissioners, each appointed by the government of a U.S. state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands. Every ULC commissioner must be an attorney. Commissioners often concurrently serve as legislators, judges, or legal scholars. 

Each jurisdiction determines the method of appointment and its number of commissioners. In most states, the governor appoints the state&#x27;s commissioners to serve a specified term. In a few states, ULC commissioners serve at the will of the appointing authority and have no specific term. ULC commissioners are volunteers who do not receive salaries or other compensation for their public service.

The current ULC President is Timothy Berg of Phoenix, Arizona, the Chair of the ULC&#x27;s Executive Committee is Lisa Jacobs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the Chair of the Scope and Program Committee is Steven Willborn of Lincoln, Nebraska. Daniel Robbins of Sherman Oaks, California, is the Immediate Past President.

==History==

The uniform law movement began in the latter half of the 19th century. The Alabama State Bar Association recognized as early as 1881 that wide variations in law between separate states often created confusion. In 1889, the New York Bar Association appointed a special committee on uniformity of laws. In 1890 the New York Legislature authorized the then-Governor of New York, Roswell Flower, to appoint three commissioners &quot;to examine certain subjects of national importance that seemed to show conflict among the laws of the several commonwealths, to ascertain the best means to effect an assimilation or uniformity in the laws of the states and territories, and especially whether it would be advisable for the State of New York to invite the other states of the Union to send representatives to a convention to draft uniform laws to be submitted for approval and adoption by the several states.&quot; The American Bar Association held its 12th Annual Meeting the same year and adopted a resolution recommending each state provide for commissioners to confer with the commissioners of other states on the uniformity of legislation on certain subjects.

In August 1892, the first session of the organization that became the Uniform Law Commission was held at the Grand Union Hotel in Saratoga Springs, New York. The gathering took place before the annual summer meeting of the American Bar Association, a tradition that continues. The gathering brought together delegates from seven states: Delaware, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. They titled themselves the &quot;Conference of the State Boards of Commissioners on Promoting Uniformity of Law in the U.S.&quot; By 1912, every state was participating in the Commission. The United States Virgin Islands was the last jurisdiction to join, appointing its first commissioner in 1988.

In each year of service, the ULC has steadily increased its contribution to state and territorial law. It quickly became known as a distinguished body of lawyers. In 1901, Woodrow Wilson became a member. Several commissioners later became Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States: Louis Brandeis, Wiley Blount Rutledge, and William H. Rehnquist. Several noted legal scholars have also been members, e.g. John Wigmore, Samuel Williston, Roscoe Pound, and John Bogart. The distinguished membership of the ULC has helped to ensure the quality of its work and made it enormously influential.

In 1940, the ULC moved to dispel confusion in U.S. commercial law with a comprehensive solution. This project led the ULC to partner with the American Law Institute to create the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The Code took ten years to complete. After another 14 years, it had been enacted in every state. It remains the signature product of the Commission.

Since its organization, the ULC has drafted more than 450 uniform laws on numerous subjects and in various fields of law, setting patterns for uniformity across the nation. Today, the Commission is recognized primarily for its work in commercial law, family law, real property law, the law of probate and estates, the law of business organizations, health law, and conflicts of law; it rarely drafts regulatory law. Uniform acts include the Uniform Collaborative Law Act, Uniform Probate Code, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, the Uniform Partnership Act, the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, the Uniform Limited Partnership Act, and the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act.

The ULC has also experienced its share of spectacular failures. In the 1970s, the ULC dedicated an enormous amount of time and effort to the cause of comprehensive reform of U.S. real property law, which then and now varies dramatically from one state to the next. The ULC&#x27;s generous and well-intended efforts were utterly futile; most of its Uniform Acts on the subject were never enacted in any state, and only bits and pieces were enacted in a handful of states. However, the Uniform Partition of Heirs Property Act (UPHPA), which addresses one of the most pernicious causes of land loss in low-income communities, has been enacted in 24 states as of 2024, and the Farm Bill passed in 2018 changed the law such that farmers in states that enact the UPHPA have increased access to federal loans and federally funded legal assistance.

The ULC is called both the Uniform Law Commission and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (still the legal name ); the acronym &quot;NCCUSL&quot; was also formerly often used, but the organization itself now uses the acronym &quot;ULC&quot; instead.

==Procedure for drafting and promulgating proposed uniform laws==
&quot;It must be emphasized that the [ULC] can only propose—no uniform law is effective until a state legislature adopts it.&quot; Frequently, a state will make substantial variations when adopting a uniform act.

Proposals for a new uniform act or model act are considered by the Committee on Scope and Program, which welcomes suggestions from the organized bar, state government entities, private interest groups, uniform law commissioners and private individuals. It may assign a suggested topic to a Study Committee, which reviews and researches the proposal and reports back to the Scope and Program Committee. Scope and Program sends its recommendations to the Executive Committee. If a recommendation to create or amend an act is approved, a Drafting Committee is selected and a reporter/drafter – an expert in the field – is hired. Advisors and participating observers are solicited to assist every Drafting Committee.

Draft acts are submitted for initial debate of the entire Commission at the ULC&#x27;s Annual Meeting. Each act must be considered section by section at no less than two annual meetings by all commissioners sitting as a Committee of the Whole. The commissioners may offer amendments and corrections to the proposed act.

Once the Committee of the Whole approves an act, it is presented for a vote by the states. Each of the 53 state and territory delegations caucuses its members and casts one vote. The proposed act must be approved (1) by no fewer than 20 jurisdictions; and, (2) by a majority of the states and territories present before it is officially approved as a uniform or model act.

At this point, the act is officially promulgated for consideration by the states and territories. Legislatures are urged to adopt uniform acts exactly as written to &quot;promote uniformity in the law among the jurisdictions adopting the act.&quot; Model acts are designed to serve as a guideline for legislation that states and territories can borrow from or adapt to suit their individual needs and conditions.

Once an act is adopted by the ULC, it is usually presented to the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association for its endorsement. Upon its endorsement, the ULC Legislative Council advocates adoption of the act in the various states and territories.

The work of the ULC simplifies the legal life of businesses and individuals by providing rules and procedures that are consistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Representing both state and territorial government and the legal profession, it has sought to bring uniformity to the divergent legal traditions of 53 sovereign jurisdictions, and has done so with significant success.

==Financial support==

The major portion of the ULC&#x27;s financial support comes from state and territorial government appropriations. Expenses are apportioned among the member jurisdictions by means of an annual assessment based on population. The ULC budget is supplemented by publishing royalties and by grants to support specific projects from foundations or the federal government.

The ULC&#x27;s minimal budget is sufficient because most of its legal expertise is donated by the commissioners. Commissioners devote thousands of hours—amounting in some cases to millions of dollars worth of time—to the development of uniform and model acts.

<text>Peter Ewart (14 May 1767 – 15 September 1842) was a British engineer who was influential in developing the technologies of turbines and theories of thermodynamics.

==Biography==
He was son of the Church of Scotland minister of Troqueer near Dumfries, and was one of eleven children. His brother Joseph Ewart became British ambassador to Prussia; John, a doctor, became Chief Inspector of East India Company hospitals in India; and William, father of William Ewart, was business partner of Sir John Gladstone, father of William Ewart Gladstone, whose godfather he was and whom he was named after.

Following graduation from the University of Edinburgh, he was apprenticed to millwright John Rennie. His work with water wheels led him to work with Matthew Boulton and James Watt for whom by 1790 he was agent in Manchester. At the same time as acting as agent he was also trading on his own account as a millwright, enabling him to provide the complementary shafts, gears and other necessities to harness the power of the Boulton &amp; Watt steam engines.

In 1792, frustrated in administering the immature and, as yet, unreliable machinery, he left Boulton and Watt to work in partnership with Samuel Oldknow in a cotton bleaching and calico printing venture. He anticipated this being a profitable concern but the partnership was dissolved within a year and he returned to engineering. In 1798 he went into partnership with Samuel Greg, installing an innovative water wheel at Greg&#x27;s Quarry Bank Mill on the River Bollin in Cheshire. As a standby, he installed a Watt steam engine.

By 1811, Ewart had abandoned the venture with Greg to concentrate on his own manufacturing business but also his scientific work. He became, along with John Dalton, a vice-president of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and became active in the contemporary controversies about heat, work and energy. Motivated by a paper of John Playfair and encouraged by Dalton, in 1813 he published &quot;On the measure of moving force&quot; in which he defended the nascent ideas of the conservation of energy championed by John Smeaton. The paper was strongly to influence Dalton&#x27;s pupil James Prescott Joule. A vocal advocate of the application of scientific knowledge in engineering, he was one of the founders of the Manchester Mechanics&#x27; Institute.

Ewart took up the post of Chief Engineer and Chief Inspector of Machinery with the Admiralty in 1835 and died on 15 September 1842 at Woolwich Dockyard when a chain snapped as he was supervising the removal of a boiler.

<text>The Camillus Cutlery Company is one of the oldest knife manufacturers in the United States. The company was founded in 1876 and produced millions of knives until it filed for bankruptcy in 2007. Its brand name and intellectual property rights were purchased by Acme United Corporation, which re-launched the Camillus brand in May 2009 using modern materials.

==History==

===Adolph Kastor===

The 14-year-old Adolph Kastor (1856–1946), is a son of a Jewish family from Wattenheim, Germany, immigrated to New York in 1870 where he started to work for his uncle Aaron Kastor in his hardware supply business, &quot;Bodenheim, Meyer &amp; Company&quot;. He started off in charge of cow chains but gradually promoted to the firearms and cutlery department.

In 1873, Bodenheim, Meyer &amp; Company lost one of its founders and restructured as &quot;Meyer &amp; Kastor&quot;. Due to poor sales figures, Meyer &amp; Kastor had to close its doors in September 1876. Only a few weeks later, Adolph Kastor started his own company, &quot;Adolph Kastor &amp; Bros.&quot; on Canal Street in New York City, where he imported and distributed German-made knives.

In 1897, when the Dingley Tariff was enacted, the knives became too expensive to import. The only solution Kastor saw was to manufacture knives domestically. Eventually, his search led him to Charles Sherwood and his small knife manufacturing business in Camillus.

===1902–1913===

With Adolph Kastor in charge, the company started to expand. They bought new machinery, such as steam-driven drop forge hammers and fly presses and they adopted new techniques, like using alumina grinding wheels. By 1910, the Camillus Cutlery Company was producing close to a million knives a year and had about 200 employees, many of them German immigrants. The company even built a dormitory to house its German workers.

===1914–1945===

During World War I, Camillus shifted production to support the Allied forces. The company also manufactured marlinspikes, surgical scalpels, and a folding knife/spoon combination for the Red Cross in those years.

In the 1920s, the knife manufacturer introduced stainless steel to its production, and started making collectible character knives, which honoured famous people such as George Washington, Babe Ruth, and Buck Rogers. It also began manufacturing private label products for Sears, Craftsman, Woolworth and many others.
During World War II, Camillus shipped more than 13 million knives of various styles to the Allied troops. In 1942, U.S. Marine Corps officers Colonel John M. Davis and Major Howard E. America working in conjunction with cutlery technicians at Camillus developed the KA-BAR Fighting Utility Knife. After extensive trials, the KA-BAR prototype was recommended for adoption, and Camillus was awarded the first contract to produce the KA-BAR for the Marine Corps. Camillus made more KA-BARs than any other knife manufacturer producing the model during World War II. During the war, Camillus also made the M3 fighting knives, the M4 bayonets and many other utility knives for U.S. forces, including machetes, multi-blade utility knives, TL-29 Signal Corps pocket knives for signalmen, electrician&#x27;s mates, and linesmen, and combination knife/marlinspike pocket knives for use by the U.S. Navy in cutting and splicing lines.

===1946–1959===

After World War II, Camillus was quick to shift back to civilian production. It introduced many new products, and in 1947, Camillus began manufacturing a full line of official folding knives for the Boy Scouts of America (BSA).

During the Vietnam War, Camillus again manufactured a large number of knives for the armed forces, for instance a pilot survival knife, a USMC KA-BAR combat knife and a four bladed utility knife. After the Vietnam War (1975), the company continued its growth by adding more new pieces to their already wide product range.

==1960-2005==
In the 1960s, Camillus was sold to the Baer family of New York City.

Camillus began using Delrin a synthetic bone from circa late 1960&#x27;s through at least the 80&#x27;s.

Camillus produced the Hand Made #89 Rancher Indian Delrin Stag Stockman 3 Triple Blade Pocket Knife with Sword Brand Blades in the 1970s. Highly collectible today. |Knife image provided by Darren Spitzenberger|

In 1991, Camillus acquired Western Cutlery Company. This Boulder, Colorado company had been making knives since 1896.

In 2001, Camillus collaborated with custom Knifemaker Jerry Fisk, the only Knifemaker to be declared a Living National Treasure, to produce a Bowie knife. That same year, Camillus began a partnership with custom Knifemaker Darryl Ralph to produce a line of titanium framed tactical folding knives.

==Bankruptcy==

Since the turn of the century, Camillus Cutlery saw its revenue decline due to stiff overseas competition and allegedly poor management practices. As a result, employees implemented a four-day workweek after the normal factory shutdown at Christmas 2005. A few months later, Camillus’ management proposed large wage and benefit cuts. Workers didn&#x27;t agree and the company was subject to a months long strike. In response, management locked the workers out for several months. In November 2006, the striking employees ultimately accepted the original contract offer but the company only retained 15 of the 78 union members and laid off the rest.

The lock out ultimately took its toll on Camillus as customers dried up and the company subsequently filed for bankruptcy and closed on February 28, 2007. On September 18, 2007, the product brand names and intellectual property of the company were acquired by Acme United Corporation in a bankruptcy auction for $200,000.

After the bankruptcy, the original Camillus factory remained empty until it was partly destroyed by fire on February 11, 2013. The former Camillus Cutlery headquarters have since been turned into apartments and retail space.

==Camillus as Acme United brand==

In May 2009, Acme United re-launched Camillus at the 2009 National Hardware Show in Las Vegas. The traditional Camillus knives were almost entirely replaced by new modern knives with durable handles and titanium carbonitride bonded blades.

In December 2011, Acme United signed an agreement with Les Stroud to build and sell Camillus survival knives and tools, co-designed and promoted by the outdoor adventurer, known from the TV series Survivorman. Next to Les Stroud, Camillus joined forces with several other so-called Pro Staffers. The Pro Staff team consists of former Green Berets, expert hunters, Special Forces, adventurers, firemen and survival experts. Amongst them is Grady Powell, a former U.S. Army Green Beret who is now the host of Discovery Channel’s Dual Survival. Also part of the Pro Staff is Jared Ogden, a former Navy SEAL who was the star of the National Geographic Television program Ultimate Survival Alaska.

In 2013, Camillus re-launched its knives in Europe. Today, Camillus is being distributed in twelve European countries, as well as in Australia, South Africa and the Philippines.

Since the relaunch, the brand annually introduces new knives. In 2017, for example, Camillus brought a new collection of hunting knives to the market, as well as a new tactical knife family, which was created in collaboration with Camillus Pro Staff members, Jared Ogden and Grady Powell.

In November 2023, Acme United sold the Camillus brand and product line to GSM Holdings Inc, which, under its GSM Outdoors umbrella, comprises over 40 hunting, shooting sports, rugged outdoors and fishing labels.

<text>Jerome Michael Trupiano (born in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American radio sportscaster, best known for his former role as a play-by-play announcer for the Boston Red Sox. Trupiano is a graduate of Saint Louis University, where he began his broadcasting career as a disc jockey on the college radio station.

==Career==
Trupiano hosted a talk show for fourteen years in Houston and called games for MLB&#x27;s Houston Astros (-86), the Montreal Expos (-90), the World Hockey Association&#x27;s Houston Aeros (1974–78), the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Houston Rockets (1978–80), the National Football League&#x27;s Houston Oilers (1980–89), Southwest Conference Football (1978–88), World League of American Football games for TSN (1992) and called games on the CBS Radio Game of the Week in before joining Joe Castiglione in the Red Sox&#x27; radio booth in .

Trupiano called the Red Sox&#x27; 2004 World Series-winning game at Busch Stadium. The Red Sox radio team was forced to an auxiliary press box due to all of the media coverage and Trupiano called the game from the booth he had used for practice broadcasts decades earlier.

===Departure from Red Sox===
On September 27, 2006, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reported that Trupiano&#x27;s contract would not be renewed and noted that Trupiano might end up with the St. Louis Cardinals. Trupiano denied that any talks with the Cardinals had taken place.

===Later activities===
On May 16, 2007, Trupiano was joined by his son Brian to call a game between the Brockton Rox and the Oil Can Boyd&#x27;s Traveling All-Stars. The All-Star team featured retired major-league players Dennis &quot;Oil Can&quot; Boyd, Bill Lee, Marquis Grissom, Delino DeShields and Ken Ryan. The game was broadcast on a taped delay by two local public-access television stations.

Trupiano also worked as on Westwood One&#x27;s broadcasts of the NCAA Men&#x27;s College World Series finals in 2007 and 2008.

In August 2009, Trupiano returned to the air on a regular weekend sports call-in show on 98.5 The Sports Hub Radio (WBZ-FM) in Boston.

Trupiano is also the main sports anchor for Lexy.com, an audio social media startup in San Francisco. His responsibilities include coverage of the major college and sports leagues, as well as his own commentary feeds such as &quot;View From the Booth&quot; and &quot;Dugout Daily.&quot;

In 2010, Trupiano signed on with Fox Sports to become the play-by-play voice of the Ivy League on Fox College Sports.

He is also an instructor at Young Broadcasters of America in Natick, Massachusetts.

==Family==
Trupiano lives in Franklin, Massachusetts, with his wife, Donna, and two children. In 2006, his son Brian played for the Brockton Rox, then a team in the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball.

<text>Clan na Gael (CnG) (, ; &quot;family of the Gaels&quot;) is an Irish republican organization, founded in the United States in the late 19th and 20th centuries, successor to the Fenian Brotherhood and a sister organization to the Irish Republican Brotherhood.

==Background==
As Irish immigration to the United States of America began to increase in the 18th century many Irish organizations were formed. One of the earliest was formed under the name of the Irish Charitable Society and was founded in Boston, Massachusetts in 1737. These new organizations went by varying names, most notably the Ancient and Most Benevolent Order of the Friendly Brothers of Saint Patrick, founded in New York in 1767, the Society of the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick for the Relief of Emigrants in Philadelphia in 1771, and the Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick also formed in New York in 1784.

In the later part of the 1780s, a strong Irish patriot (rather than Catholic) character began to grow in these organizations and amongst recently arrived Irish immigrants. The usage of Celtic symbolism helped solidify this sense of nationalism and was most noticeably found in the use of the name &quot;Hibernian.&quot; (Hibernia is the Latin name for Ireland.)

In 1858, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) had been founded in Dublin by James Stephens. The initial decision to create this organization came about after Stephens consulted, through special emissary Joseph Denieffe, with John O&#x27;Mahony and Michael Doheny, members of a precursor group called the Emmet Monument Association.

In response to the establishment of the IRB in Dublin, a sister organization was founded in New York City, the Fenian Brotherhood, led by O&#x27;Mahony. This arm of Fenian activity in America produced a surge in radicalism among groups of Irish immigrants, many of whom had recently emigrated from Ireland during and after the Great Hunger. In October, 1865, the Fenian Philadelphia Congress met and appointed the Irish Republican Government in the US. But in 1865, in Ireland, the IRB newspaper &quot;The Irish People&quot; had been raided by the police and the IRB leadership was imprisoned. Another abortive uprising would occur in 1867, but the British remained in control.

After the 1865 crackdown in Ireland, the American organization began to fracture over what to do next. Made up of veterans of the American Civil War, a Fenian army had been formed. While O&#x27;Mahony and his supporters wanted to remain focused on supporting rebellions in Ireland a competing faction, called the Roberts, or senate wing, wanted this Fenian Army to attack British bases in Canada. The resulting Fenian Raids strained US–British relations. The level of American support for the Fenian cause began to diminish as the Fenians were seen as a threat to stability in the region.

The Irish were still seen as a foreign people within the borders of the American state by anti-Catholic Americans such as members of the Know-Nothing Party; their existence within America was seen primarily as temporary camps of immigrants who planned to stay in America only as long as the British stayed in Ireland. Upon the British withdrawal from Irish soil, it was believed, the Irish immigrants would return to their native land. The Fenian Raids were seen as an astonishing example of immigrant activity in US history and Irish nationalism has itself become something of an exception among the American melting pot. Very few US immigrants concerned themselves with their mother country as did the Irish; in March 1868, 100,000 Fenian supporters held an anti-British demonstration in New York.

== Creation ==
After 1867, the Irish Republican Brotherhood headquarters in Manchester chose to support neither of the existing feuding factions, but instead promoted a renewed Irish republican organization in America, to be named Clan na Gael. According to John Devoy in 1924, Jerome J. Collins founded what was then called the Napper Tandy Club in New York on 20 June 1867 – Wolfe Tone&#x27;s birthday. This club expanded into others and at one point at a picnic in 1870 was named the Clan na Gael by Sam Cavanagh. This was the same Cavanagh who killed the informer George Clark, who had exposed a Fenian pike-making operation in Dublin to the police.

Collins, who died in 1881 on the disastrous &quot;Jeannette&quot; expedition to the North Pole, was a science editor for the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, who had left England in 1866 when a plot he was involved in to free the Fenian prisoners at Pentonville Prison was uncovered by the police. Collins believed at the time of the founding in 1867 that the two feuding Fenians branches should patch things up.

== Catalpa rescue ==

After arriving in America in 1871 John Devoy indicated he joined the Clan na Gael early on and attempted several times at Clan conventions to get the Clan to adopt a plan to free the military prisoners held by the British in Fremantle Australia. In 1874 John Devoy, with some oratorical help from Thomas Francis Bourke, was elected chairman of the executive board of the Clan and was also chosen to execute the rescue of the prisoners. Bourke warned Devoy that there would be &quot;kickers&quot; and he would have to have a heavy hand to control the Clan na Gael and succeed in the project. John Devoy devoted all his time to this project and oversaw the purchase of the bark &quot;Catalpa&quot; and the outfitting of this ship as a whaler. The Clan hired American George S. Anthony as its ship captain along with a New Bedford-based whaling crew. John received considerable help in running the Clan from Dr. William Carroll who was elected Executive Board Chairman in 1875 and between them they controlled Clan activity until 1882. Carroll was of Ulster Protestant stock and brought in others to the Clan from the upper middle class such as Simon Barclay Conover, senator from Florida. Devoy&#x27;s nemesis during the fund raising for the enterprise was John Goff, an aspiring Clan member who later became a New York Supreme Court Judge and who, perhaps, resented the influence of Bourke and Devoy in the Clan. Devoy did in fact take a strong hand and began tossing out Clan members for malfeasance in office and violation of Clan rules as is shown in &quot;General Circular No. 2&quot; dated 15 January 1875. The success of the rescue in 1876 resulted in the Clan na Gael replacing for all practical purposes the Fenian Brotherhood as the spokesman of Irish-American nationalism.

Under the leadership of John Devoy, Clan na Gael would eventually be successful in educating Americans about the movement.

==New Departure 1879==

In 1879, Devoy promoted a &quot;New Departure&quot; in Irish republican thinking, by which the &quot;physical force party&quot; allied itself with the Irish Parliamentary Party under the political leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, MP; the political plans of the Fenians were thus combined with the agrarian revolution inaugurated by the Irish National Land League. The arrangement was cemented at the first Irish Race Convention held in Chicago in 1881.

By 1880, more aggressive men within the Clan na Gael were chafing at the slow pace of Devoy and Carroll and these men were able to take control of the organization in 1882 when two &quot;action men&quot;, Alexander Sullivan and Michael Boland took over the reins and ran the clan as a dictatorship along with an inactive Mr. Feeley. The new leadership ignored the Revolutionary Council set up by Carroll to coordinate between the IRB and the Clan and began to operate in total secrecy from even the membership of the Clan. These three men called themselves the &quot;Triangle&quot; and began making bombing runs into England in what was called the &quot;Dynamite War&quot;. This infuriated the IRB in Ireland which cut ties with the Irish-Americans. Michael Boland was later pointed out as a British spy which might have explained why the majority of the bombers were caught and jailed before they could strike.

The 1880s saw the solidification, at least within America, of Irish ideological orientations, with most nationalist sentiment finding its home within Clan na Gael, rather than organizations such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians. The more agrarian-minded found their ideological brethren within the Irish Federation of America. The third ideological strand was connected to the union and socialist movement and found support with the Knights of Labor. In the late 1880s a financial scandal in the Chicago branch of the Clan led to a successful conspiracy to murder whistle-blower Dr. Patrick Henry Cronin. John Devoy, who worked with Cronin, also began carrying a gun and expected to be assassinated by Alexander Sullivan&#x27;s henchmen. The Cronin case, prosecuted by State&#x27;s Attorney Joel Minnick Longenecker achieved international attention. Neither the prosecution nor the defense were concerned with the Clan&#x27;s ties to the Fenians, trying the case simply as a conspiracy to commit murder. The Clan na Gael had split into pro and anti Sullivan/Boland branches, but was re-united by John Devoy around 1900.

In Ireland the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) achieved electoral success in the 1880s, and was supported by the British prime minister William Gladstone who introduced the unsuccessful Government of Ireland Bill 1886. Gladstone&#x27;s party then divided over home rule, and the IPP also divided for a decade over Parnell&#x27;s marriage to Mrs. O&#x27;Shea.

In 1891, a moderate offshoot of the Clan na Gael broke away and formed an organization under the name of Irish National Federation of America with T. Emmet as president. The federation supported the National Party in Ireland, a splinter group of Parnell&#x27;s Home Rule Party. Rising to prominence within the Clan from the 1890s were Daniel Cohalan (later to be a judge of the New York Supreme Court) and Joseph McGarrity.

==In the 20th century==

The objective of Clan na Gael was to secure an independent Ireland and to assist the Irish Republican Brotherhood in achieving this aim. To this end, the Clan was prepared to enter into alliances with any nation allied against the British; with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, the Clan found its greatest ally in Imperial Germany. A delegation led by Devoy met with the German ambassador in the US Count Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and his aide Franz von Papen in 1914. This was followed by an emissary John Kenny, sent on a mission to Berlin to discuss how the German war effort and Irish Nationalism could cooperate. Roger Casement wrote a petition to the Kaiser asking that freedom for Ireland be included in the declared war aims of the Central Powers. A controversial pro-German and Irish lecture was given in December 1914 to Clan na Gael on Long Island by the Celtologist Kuno Meyer. Devoy, along with Roger Casement and Joseph McGarrity, was able to bring together both Irish-American and German support in the years prior to the Easter Rising. However the German munitions never reached Ireland as the ship &quot;Aud&quot; carrying them was scuttled after being intercepted by the Royal Navy.

Clan na Gael became the largest single financier of both the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence. Imperial Germany aided Clan na Gael by selling those guns and munitions to be used in the uprising of 1916. Germany had hoped that by distracting Britain with an Irish uprising they would be able to garner the upper hand in the war and effect a German victory on the Western Front. However, they failed to follow through with more support. Clan na Gael was also involved via McGarrity and Casement in the abortive attempt to raise an &quot;Irish Brigade&quot; to fight against the British.

Some Sikhs held talks with Clan Na Gael, which led to authorities in Great Britain and India fearing Irish-Americans and Sikhs uniting against the British Empire. Clan Na Gael supported the primarily Sikh Ghadar Party, and played a supportive role in the Hindu German Conspiracy in the United States during World War I, which led to the Hindu German Conspiracy Trial in San Francisco in 1917–18.

Clan Na Gael largely controlled the Irish Race Conventions from 1916, and its affiliated group the Friends of Irish Freedom. The Irish War of Independence led to a split in Clan na Gael which was precipitated in June 1920 by Éamon de Valera, who as President of the Irish Republic became involved in a dispute with Devoy and Judge Cohalan over lobbying US presidential candidates on the issue of American recognition for the Irish Republic. To punish Woodrow Wilson for his apparent lack of support, the Clan backed Harding in the 1920 United States presidential election. In October, 1920, Harry Boland stated that the IRB in Ireland had terminated connections between the Clan and the parent body in Ireland until the will of Dáil Éireann was mirrored in Clan na Gael. Devoy and Cohalan refused to accept this but McGarrity disagreed, believing that without IRB support, the Clan was not legitimate, which led to a split. McGarrity, whose faction went by the name Reorganized Clan na Gael, supported the Anti-Treaty forces during the Civil War while Devoy and Cohalan supported the Free State. After 1924, when the IRB and the Devoy-Cohalan Clan na Gael both voted to disband, McGarrity&#x27;s faction became the sole Clan na Gael. In 1926, the Clan na Gael formally associated with the reorganized Irish Republican Army in the same fashion as it had with the IRB.

McGarrity continued to provide support and aid to the IRA after it was outlawed in Ireland by de Valera in 1936 but became less active in the 1940s and 1950s following McGarrity&#x27;s death in 1940. The organization grew in the 1970s and played a key part in NORAID, which was a prominent source of finance and weapons for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) during the Troubles in Northern Ireland in 1969–1998. However, it provided only a tiny portion of the PIRA&#x27;s total income and dried up because of the steep decline of sympathy among Irish Americans due to PIRA atrocities, and the investigation and prosecution by U.S. authorities of IRA supporters of gunrunning.

The Clan na Gael still exists today, much changed from the days of the &quot;Catalpa&quot; rescue and as recently as 1997 another internal split occurred as a result of the IRA shift away from using physical force as a result of the 1998 Good Friday peace accords.

==Presidents of the Clan na Gael==

From its founding in 1869, although heavily influenced by founder John Devoy over the years, the organization was nominally under the control of an executive committee headed by a national Executive Board Chairman. This executive committee was elected at yearly, later ever other year, conventions. At the convention held in Chicago during 1881, the committee was reduced to five members making it easier to control. The committee then came under the domination of Michael Boland, D. S. Freely and national executive chairman Alexander Sullivan who together were known as &quot;the Triangle&quot;.

The first Chairman perhaps should be Jerome Collins as the man who founded the first Club (D1) of what would later be called the Clan na Gael (these clubs later were called &quot;Camps&quot;). The club was named Napper Tandy after an Irish patriot. From the beginning, according to John Devoy in the Gaelic American, the secretary of Napper Tandy and later of the Clan na Gael was William James Nicholson. He was secretary from 1867 to 1874 when he was dismissed for loaning Camp Funds which were not repaid. According to a descendant of the John Haltigan the foreman printer of the Irish People, James Haltigan son of John Haltigan was Executive Board Chairman in 1871.

In 1873 James Ryan was Executive Board Chairman.
In 1874 John Devoy was chosen Executive Board Chairman at the Baltimore Convention.
From 1875 until he resigned in 1879, John Devoy&#x27;s trusted friend and ardent nationalist Dr. William Carroll of Philadelphia was Executive Board Chairman. James Reynolds of Connecticut temporarily held the post from Carroll&#x27;s resignation until 1881 (there was no convention in 1880) when the Triangle of Sullivan, Feeley and Boland assumed command. Although Devoy supporters Reynolds and Treacy remained on the executive board, they were left out of the decision-making process by the Triangle. The Triangle&#x27;s bombing campaign split the organization into two factions in the mid-1880s. After the murder of Cronin, the Clan na Gael united once again under John Devoy in 1900. John Kenny served as president of the Napper Tandy branch in 1883 and again in 1914.

<text>The Dave Brockie Experience or DBX was a rock band formed of three of the then-current members of Heavy metal band Gwar. The band was composed of David &quot;Oderus Urungus&quot; Brockie (vocals/bass), Brad &quot;Jizmak Da Gusha&quot; Roberts (drums), and Mike &quot;Balsac the Jaws of Death&quot; Derks (guitar). 

The DBX was a pet project of Gwar and showed some of their earlier punk roots from the &quot;Death Piggy&quot; era. At their shows they played some original DBX songs as well as some tunes from Death Piggy, Gwar, and X-Cops. The band enjoyed a following mostly made up of Gwar fans. Brockie hinted at the possibility of the band&#x27;s breakup in the past due to the exhausting nature of lower-budget touring. 

In February 2008, several sources reported that the band would be touring as an opening act for the reunited Green Jellÿ. Dave Brockie stated on his website that this was not the case and there were no official discussions concerning the tour. DBX played two reunion shows in August 2009.

Brockie died of a heroin overdose on March 23, 2014.

<text>Bernice Thurman Hunter, (November 3, 1922 – May 29, 2002) was a Canadian children&#x27;s author.

==Life and career==
Born in Toronto, Hunter spent her adult years as an Eaton&#x27;s employee, and did not publish her first book, &quot;That Scatterbrain Booky&quot; (1981), until she was a grandmother. Her stories are recalled fondly by her fans for showing an accurate and enjoyable portrayal of Toronto through the Depression and War years. She maintained a connection with her roots, and frequently returned to the areas she wrote about to give public readings of her works.

Hunter experienced a multitude of health challenges in her later years, however she continued writing. In 2001, she was made a Member of the Order of Canada. While the honour was awarded posthumously, she was informed of the award shortly before her death.

Her first series of books has been adapted into a film called &quot;Booky Makes Her Mark&quot;.

<doc id="1247406" wikidata="Q667725" url="?curid=1247406" title="Christian Social Party (Switzerland)">
<text>The Christian Social Party (CSP) (, ) is a political party in Switzerland of the Christian left. The CSP is more aligned with social democracy than the other major Christian party, the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland (CVP), which is more economically liberal. With the moderate Christian left as its background, the CSP commits itself to social-democratic and environmentalist political solutions. The core principles of the CSP contain, among others, &quot;solidarity with the socially and economically disadvantaged and the preservation of the environment.&quot;

== Electoral power==
As of 2016, the CSP does not hold any seats in the National Council of Switzerland.

A seat in the lower house was once held for decades by Hugo Fasel representing the canton of Fribourg.

On a cantonal level, the CSP has many elected members, mainly in the Roman Catholic cantons of Valais, Fribourg, Obwalden and Jura. In the latter, the CSP had until late 2010 one elected member in the Executive body, the Conseil d&#x27;Etat of the Republic of Jura (where it operates as the &quot;Independent Christian Social Party&quot;).

== Positions ==
A member of the Christian left, the CSP is a centre-left political party overall and has strong environmentalist views. It also has social values and aims to tax richer people. On a societal point of view, it has more progressive views and acts in favour of abortion rights, same-sex relationships and euthanasia, which differs strongly with other common Christian political parties, which are traditionally socially conservative.

<text>Joseph John Castiglione (born March 2, 1947) is an American retired radio announcer, best known for his 42 seasons announcing games of the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball. He has also been a college lecturer, and author. Castiglione was the recipient of the 2024 Ford C. Frick Award, presented by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, and is an inductee of the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame.

==Early life and career==
Castiglione was born in Hamden, Connecticut, and graduated from Colgate University with a BA in Liberal Arts. He was the radio voice of Colgate football and baseball while a student. He then received an MA in radio/TV from Syracuse University&#x27;s S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications in 1970. He also worked on the WAER-FM staff at SU. While at Syracuse, he worked a variety of on-air jobs for WSYR-TV (now WSTM-TV). He began his career in Youngstown, Ohio, broadcasting football games for $15 a game, and as sports reporter for WFMJ-TV in 1972.

Castiglione states that he was a New York Yankees fan as a kid, then closely followed the Pittsburgh Pirates because they were the closest to Youngstown, and likewise became an Indians fan after moving to Cleveland. His first major job as a sportscaster was in Cleveland, at WKYC-TV in 1978. In 1979, he called Cleveland Indians and Cleveland Cavaliers games, and continued sports reporting for WKYC-TV. He also called a handful of Milwaukee Brewers games for pay-cable channel SelecTV in 1981.

==Career with the Red Sox==
Castiglione joined the Red Sox broadcast team in 1983, teamed with Ken Coleman. He admitted to not being in the booth when the ball rolled through Bill Buckner&#x27;s legs in the 1986 World Series, as he was in the clubhouse covering Red Sox&#x27; seemingly impending victory celebration. After Coleman&#x27;s retirement in 1989, Bob Starr became the lead announcer for the Red Sox. After Starr&#x27;s departure at the end of the 1992 season, Castiglione became the team&#x27;s lead radio announcer along with Jerry Trupiano. Castiglione became nationally known when the team won the 2004 World Series, with his broadcast of the end of the game. His jubilant &quot;Can you believe it?&quot; after the final out became a catchphrase. His call, “Swing and a ground ball, stabbed by Foulke. He has it, he underhands to first and the Boston Red Sox are the world champions. For the first time in 86 years, the Red Sox have won baseball’s world championship. Can you believe it?” is considered to be far superior to Joe Buck’s call &quot;Back to Foulke. Red Sox fans have longed to hear it: The Boston Red Sox are World Champions!&quot;

During the 2007 season, Castiglione shared announcing duties with a rotating duo of Dave O&#x27;Brien and Glenn Geffner. With Geffner leaving for the Florida Marlins broadcast booth, Castiglione shared the booth with Dave O&#x27;Brien, Dale Arnold or Jon Rish in 2008. Dave O&#x27;Brien and Jon Rish were his partners from 2009 through April 2013. In 2011, Dale Arnold returned to be the primary fill in on Wednesday games. Starting in May 2013, Rob Bradford, Lou Merloni and O&#x27;Brien were his partners after John Ryder replaced Rish, with Merloni and Bradford stepping in for fill-in play by play duties. In 2011, O&#x27;Brien became the lead announcer with Castiglione moving back to the secondary announcing role. Castiglione handled play-by-play in innings 3–4 and 6–7 with O&#x27;Brien, and all innings when working with Bradford and Merloni.

In 2016, with O&#x27;Brien moving to New England Sports Network (NESN), the Red Sox television network, Castiglione began working with former Pittsburgh Pirates broadcaster Tim Neverett and once again was the primary game announcer calling innings 1–2, 5 and 8–9 on WEEI. In 2017, Castiglione and Neverett rotated games as the primary and secondary announcers.

On September 20, 2018, as part of a promotion called &quot;A Rivalry in the Booth&quot;, Castiglione switched places with New York Yankees radio broadcaster John Sterling in the fourth inning. During the 2018 American League Championship Series (ALCS), Castiglione reacted to a catch made by Andrew Benintendi made in the ninth inning of Game 4. Castiglione fell out of his chair, and proceeded to finish the commentary with co-commentator Neverett after the incident.

For the 2023 season, Castiglione began working a reduced role, only calling 81 games as the primary announcer in order to spend more time with his family. He worked with Will Flemming and Sean McDonough as secondary announcers, along with former player Lou Merloni.

On September 15, 2024, Castiglione announced his retirement from the Red Sox&#x27; broadcast booth following the 2024 season. He stated that he would continue in an ambassador-type role for the team. Castiglione was honored by the Red Sox on September 29 with a pregame ceremony, as various players whom he covered over his 42 year stint showed up to pay their respects to his career. Pedro Martinez joined Castiglione in the radio booth, as he recalled the longevity of his career, and NESN honored Castiglione by simulcasting his WEEI broadcast on television during the top of the ninth inning. Castiglione ended his broadcast as he traditionally did at the close of each season since 1989, reciting a passage by Bart Giamatti from the essay &quot;The Green Fields of the Mind&quot;.

“[Baseball] breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall all alone. You count on it, rely on it to buffer the passage of time, to keep the memory of sunshine and high skies alive, and then just when the days are all twilight, when you need it most, it stops.&quot;
==Awards and honors==
In August 2014, Castiglione was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame, along with former players Roger Clemens, Pedro Martínez, and Nomar Garciaparra.

On July 28, 2022, Castiglione was honored in a pregame ceremony at Fenway Park for his 40 years of broadcasting the Red Sox; the ceremony included Roger Clemens presenting Castiglione with a plaque. 

On October 22, 2023, the Baseball Hall of Fame announced that Castiglione was one of 10 finalists for the 2024 Ford C. Frick Award, presented annually by the Hall of Fame for excellence in broadcasting. Castilgione had also been nominated as one of the ten finalists in 2023, but the award was presented to Chicago Cubs broadcaster Pat Hughes. On December 6, 2023, Castiglione was named as the 2024 recipient of the award, and later accepted the award during the Hall of Fame induction weekend in July 2024.

==Other work==
Castiglione has occasionally called college football and college basketball, most notably including games of Lafayette College and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, where he worked alongside his oldest son, Duke, who has worked as a sportscaster with WCVB in Boston.

Castiglione has worked as a lecturer in the department of Communication Studies at Northeastern University, teaching a course on sports broadcasting. Play-by-play announcers Don Orsillo and Uri Berenguer were among his students and broadcast booth interns. Castiglione has also taught at Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire.

==Books==
In 2004, Castiglione published a book called &quot;Broadcast Rites and Sites: I Saw It on the Radio with the Boston Red Sox&quot;. The book is a collection of stories from his days covering the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox. It was updated in 2006 to include material on the 2004 World Series. In 2012, Castiglione returned to writing with a second book entitled &quot;Can You Believe It? 30 Years of Insider Stories with the Boston Red Sox&quot;. In this book, he takes the reader back to the 2004 ALCS with the Yankees and that year&#x27;s World Series as well as the team&#x27;s return to glory in 2007. However, much of the book is about the 30 years that Castiglione spent in the broadcast booth and the personal relationships he built up over that time, woven into the ups and downs in Red Sox history.

<doc id="1247422" wikidata="Q6929175" url="?curid=1247422" title="Mr Sheen">
<text>Mr Sheen is the brand name of a range of cleaning materials, mainly floor and furniture polish, created in Australia in the 1950s by Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd. An aerosol, the product uses a combination of silicones, waxes and solvents and is currently manufactured by Reckitt. Alongside Australia, Mr Sheen is also available in Jamaica, Kenya, Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as in Zimbabwe, Zambia and South Africa where it is called Mr Min and in Argentina where it is known as Mr Frend. The Mr Sheen character and branding, despite numerous revamps, has a high level of recognition amongst consumers, so much so that the company has been able to go for periods of time without even advertising the product, such as in the early 1990s.

== History ==
In the 1950s, the Australian cleaning product market lacked any aerosol-based products, hence the development of Mr Sheen by Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd, it was the first such product to be offered in the Australian market. The popularity of Mr Sheen received a large boost when the advertising agency Hansen Rubensohn developed both a jingle and a character for the product in the late 1950s. The Australian character (supposedly modeled on one of Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd&#x27;s employees at the time) was created by Vic Nicholson and Brian Henderson as a smiling, rosy-cheeked, short bald man with spectacles in a black suit (voiced by Ross Higgins); a jingle based on &quot;Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean&quot; was created at the same time by Bob Gibson and Jimmy White. Both the character and jingle have proved effective branding agents in Australia, where 95% of the populace are capable of recognising the character and jingle as belonging to the Mr Sheen product range. In 1969, British multinational consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser (then called Reckitt &amp; Colman) acquired Samuel Taylor Pty Ltd; the new owners expanded the range of the product out to the United Kingdom and South Africa. The British version of the character is a cartoon caricature of a First World War biplane pilot (originally voiced by Willie Rushton in the television advertisements) who flies around the house on a dusting cloth cleaning tables, banisters and television sets, using the slogan &quot;Mr Sheen shines umpteen things clean&quot;.

<text>Cador () is a legendary Duke of Cornwall, known chiefly through Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; and previous manuscript sources such as the &quot;Life of Carantoc&quot;. In Welsh genealogical records, he appears as Cado (), the son of Cornish king Geraint. Early sources present him as a relative of King Arthur, though the details of their kinship are usually left unspecified.

==Historicity==
Many stories involving Arthurian figures were told orally, leading to many interpretations and versions of the people, events, and characters. Scholars question the historical accuracy of these tales and most have been discredited, so the people associated with him could conceivably have been added by later storytellers.

One such figure was Arthur&#x27;s close associate Cador, successor to Geraint ab Erbin. Cador Duke of Cornwall was summoned to Arthur&#x27;s court and may have been a real historical figure, but the diversity of interpretations and stories that include him make it difficult to understand his true context. The book &quot;King Arthur: The Truth Behind the Legend&quot; explains how Arthurian events mix fact and fiction, stating that while many people and events could not have been real,

The factuality of many details is debatable. Arthur gave his crown to Constantine, son of Cador Duke of Cornwall, as he died May 21, 542 AD, which sets the time period in which Cador could have lived.

Cador is described as the son of a Dumnonian king named Gerrens, whom he succeeded as monarch. Traditionally, he was Arthur&#x27;s good friend and even shared his throne in the &quot;Vita Sanctus Carantoci&quot; (Life of St. Carantoc). He seemed to have a good relationship with King Caradoc of Gwent.

Four hillforts all named &quot;Cadbury&quot;—one near Clevedon, one in Congresbury, one in Sparkford in Somerset, and one by the Exe in Devon north of Crediton—may have been named after Cador since the name may mean &quot;Cado&#x27;s fort&quot;. Similarly, Cadson Bury hillfort lies just outside Callington and is also known as &quot;Celliwig&quot; in Cornwall.

==Name==
The name &quot;Cador&quot; does not match any early Welsh sources, so the name itself stems from a misinterpretation of either the name &quot;Catgur&quot; in the Harley genealogy, or the British &quot;Catigern&quot;. These names are similarly interpreted: &quot;Cador&quot; means &#x27;battle notable&#x27; or &#x27;fighter&#x27; since &quot;cat&quot; means &#x27;battle&#x27; and &quot;gur&quot; means &#x27;man&#x27; or &#x27;warrior&#x27;, and &quot;Tigern&quot; means &#x27;leader&#x27;. While the name is not found in early Welsh sources, letters could easily have dropped out of &quot;Catgur&quot; or &quot;Catigern&quot;, leaving the name &quot;Cador&quot;.

Cador, mainly mentioned by Geoffrey of Monmouth, has also been called by two other names, Cado and Cadwy, in the &quot;Myvyrian&quot; and &quot;Life of S. Carannog&quot; and in early fifteenth century pedigrees. The Duke of Cornwall title took different forms over time because Cornwall was once a part of the Roman civitas of Dumnonia, giving Cador the often-seen title &quot;King of Dumnonia&quot;.

==Cador’s battles==
Cador&#x27;s battles are not recorded in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; Arthurian battle list but are mentioned in many different works.

He battled and defeated an invading force of Saxons on their way to York, then took York himself. The Saxons surrendered, pledged peace, and retreated. Later, they broke that pledge, which led to another battle between Arthur and the Saxons in which Cador killed the Saxon leader Chelric. Thereafter, following a few small altercations (like the Roman War), Cador&#x27;s next big battle was at Camblan, after which he was found dead with some of his troops.

Some scholars speculate that Cador&#x27;s battles can be seen through the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; presumably written by Alfred the Great. Since it names only one British commander, Vortigern, scholars have aligned the timelines in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; to assess the legitimacy of Cador. Many similarities between the battles can be noted, starting with an encounter in York, or along the Canterbury–London road with 3,000 to 4,000 British soldiers. Arthur and the British retreat to London in both versions. Cador&#x27;s supposed next battle was in Thanet, which is noted in both texts. The unnamed British commander in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; has been posited to be the Cador of &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; because of their similarities.

==Arthurian pseudohistory and legend==
Cador, Duke of Cornwall, appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (ca. 1135). He is a man of power, referred to as both a duke () and a king (). He is best known for his heroism in the battles of York and Isle of Thanet, recounted in the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. The historicity of Cador&#x27;s involvement in these wars is still questioned by scholars. He won both battles, easily defeating the army in York and also killing Chelric, the leader of the Saxons, on the Isle of Thanet. Arthur&#x27;s most successful siege, the Battle of Badon, precedes the battle at the Isle of Thanet, which seems strangely illogical given the timeline. Because no Saxon or British historians note any battle in that region before the sixth century, this battle could plausibly have been completely fabricated for literary purposes.

Cador was reputedly the son of Geraint (; ), King of Dumnonia and a historic hero who died quite early, leaving his crown to Hoel because Cador was not of age. He was known to have children himself: Constantine (), Peredur, and Cadoc. He shared a lineage with King Arthur as a great-grandson of Arthur&#x27;s duke, based on the equivalency of Custennyn&#x27;s and Constantine&#x27;s genealogies.

Cador also had three brothers named Cyngar, Iestyn, and Selyf, all saints of Llancarfan; they are mentioned as related to Cador in the &quot;Myvyrian&quot;. In addition to his brothers, he had a sister named Gurguint who married Caradoc Vreichfas, a legend of Welsh prehistory who lived at same time period as Arthur. Many historians believe Caradoc Vreichfas was Cerdic of Wessex, Anglo-Saxon founder of the House of Wessex and the first king of Saxon Wessex (reign 519–534). According to Geoffrey, Cador married a woman named Ygerna (Igraine), who was courted and seduced by Arthur&#x27;s father Uther Pendragon while Cador was away at war.

Cador is thought to be related to Arthur because in different texts he is addressed as such. Layamon, an English poet, wrote that Arthur said, &quot;Cador, thou art mine own kin.&quot; However, some works say that Cador&#x27;s son Constantine was Arthur&#x27;s cousin, making Cador possibly an in-law rather than a blood relative.

In Geoffrey&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; and elsewhere, Arthur&#x27;s future queen Guinevere is said to have been raised as Cador&#x27;s ward. Cador is also said to be of Roman stock. His son Constantine was given the kingship of Britain by Arthur as he lay ailing on the field of Camlann. In the &quot;Brut Tysilio&quot;, the translator adds that Cador was the son of Gorlois, presumably by Igraine, which would make him Arthur&#x27;s maternal half-brother. The same text also gives Cador a son, Mayric, who dies fighting the Romans. This story appears in Richard Hardyng&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; which refers to Cador as Arthur&#x27;s brother &quot;of his mother&#x27;s syde.&quot; In Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;, Cador appears as a leader who takes charge of Uther&#x27;s host when it is attacked by Gorlois as Uther secretly lies with Igraine in Tintagel. Most of the later works, such as the English &quot;Alliterative Morte Arthure&quot; and Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, however, refer to Cador as Arthur&#x27;s cousin, though in the &quot;Alliterative&quot; text, Arthur calls him his sister&#x27;s son.

William Worcester travelled to Cornwall in 1478 and recorded in his &quot;Itineraries&quot; that &quot;Tador Duke of Cornwall, husband of the mother of Arthur was slain&quot; at Castle an Dinas. This is sometimes interpreted directly as Cador, and is generally interpreted as a conflation of Cador with Gorlois (the husband of Igraine in &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;), but likely reflects a local tradition, as the &quot;Historia&quot; is the only authority for Gorlois as Igraine&#x27;s husband.

In &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;, a medieval romance associated with the &quot;Mabinogion,&quot; Cador is &quot;Cadwr Earl of Cornwall, the man whose task it is to arm the king on the day of battle and conflict&quot; – i.e. at the Battle of Badon Hill, which the writer situates close to the upper River Severn.

<doc id="1247439" wikidata="Q390105" url="?curid=1247439" title="Municipality of Ashfield">
<text>The Municipality of Ashfield was a local government area in the Inner West of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is about west of the Sydney central business district. The municipality was proclaimed on 28 December 1871 as the &quot;Borough of Ashfield&quot;, which changed to the &quot;Municipality of Ashfield&quot; in 1906. On 12 May 2016, Ashfield merged with Marrickville Council and the Municipality of Leichhardt to form the Inner West Council.

The last mayor of the municipality was councillor Lucille McKenna, a member of the Australian Labor Party.

In December 2021, a majority of voters in Inner West Council voted in favour of reversing the 2016 merger and separating the three pre-existing councils of Ashfield, Leichhardt and Marrickville.

== Suburbs ==
The municipality comprised the following suburbs and localities:
* Ashfield
* Dobroyd Point
* Haberfield
* Summer Hill

It also included parts of:
* Ashbury (shared with City of Canterbury)
* Croydon (shared with Municipality of Burwood)
* Hurlstone Park (shared with City of Canterbury)
* Croydon Park (shared with City of Canterbury and the Municipality of Burwood)

==Council history==
The &quot;Borough of Ashfield&quot; was proclaimed in the New South Wales Government Gazette on 28 December 1871 and was originally divided into two wards, North Ward and South Ward.
Local issues in the area, before the forced merge into Inner West Council, included the redevelopment of Ashfield Mall and concerns about overdevelopment in general; construction of the M4 East tunnel because it might lead to increased traffic and pollution; and the general state of the commercial area, which one councillor labelled &#x27;Trashfield&#x27;. Also contentious was Ashfield Council itself. In 2003, it was described by the Daily Telegraph as one of the worst councils in Sydney after one councillor took out a restraining order against another. By 2008, another councillor was sacked for not being a bona fide resident of the municipality while other councillors had made outspoken comments on issues such as the Iraq War, bird flu, the Monarchy and 30 km/h speed limits within residential areas. In 2009, Councillor Nick Adams was given a six-month suspension from the Liberal Party of Australia for conduct deemed likely to &quot;embarrass or cause damage to&quot; the Party during an altercation with a journalist.

A 2015 review of local government boundaries recommended that the Municipality of Ashfield merge with the Municipality of Leichhardt and the Marrickville Council to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately . On 12 May 2016, Ashfield merged with Marrickville Council and the Municipality of Leichhardt to form the Inner West Council.

== Demographics ==
At the 2011 Census, there were 41,214 people in the Ashfield local government area, of these 48.6% were male and 51.4% were female. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 0.6% of the population. The median age of people in the Municipality of Ashfield was 37 years. Children aged 0 – 14 years made up 15.1% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 14.4% of the population. Of people in the area aged 15 years and over, 45.1% were married and 10.0% were either divorced or separated.

Population growth in The Municipality of Ashfield between the 2001 Census and the 2006 Census was 1.76%; while in the subsequent five years to the 2011 Census, population growth was 3.90%. When compared with total population growth of Australia for the same periods, being 5.78% and 8.32% respectively, population growth in Ashfield local government area was significantly less than the national average. The median weekly income for residents within the Municipality of Ashfield of was generally on par with the national average.

At the 2011 Census, the proportion of residents in Ashfield local government area who stated their ancestry as Chinese was in excess of four times the state and national averages; and the proportion of households where an Asian language was spoken at home was about six times higher than the national average.

== Council ==

===Final composition and election method===
The former Ashfield Municipal Council was generally considered a safe Labor area. As the attached table shows, Labor outpolled all other parties in the area at the final federal, state and council elections before the merge. However, the Liberals and Greens had strong voices in the area with the Council electing a member of the Greens Party as mayor and the northern part of Ashfield was represented by a Liberal Party member in the NSW Parliament. Prior to the 1970s, the area was more conservative, generally returning members who were Free Trade, Nationalist, UAP or Liberal although it wasn&#x27;t unheard of for Labor members to get elected during this period.

The final council was composed of four Labor councillors, four independents and four Liberals. The last mayor was Lucille McKenna, the Council&#x27;s first woman mayor. 

Ashfield Municipal Council was composed of twelve councillors elected proportionally as four separate wards, each electing three Councillors. All Councillors were elected for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor and deputy mayor were elected for a one-year term by the councillors at the first meeting of the council in September. The last election was held on 13 September 2012, and the makeup of the council for the term 2012–16, in order of election by ward, was as follows:

===Logo===
Ashfield Council launched a new logo and branding in August 2008, described as an &quot;urban map&quot; of various images representing various buildings and forms in the local area. This branding remained in use (with the arms retained for the most formal uses) until the council&#x27;s amalgamation.

<text>Big Boy Restaurant Group, LLC, doing business as Big Boy, is an American casual dining restaurant chain headquartered in Southfield, Michigan. The Big Boy name, design aesthetic, and menu were previously licensed to a number of regional franchisees.

Big Boy began as Bob&#x27;s Pantry in 1936 by Bob Wian in Glendale, California. The restaurants became known as &quot;Bob&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s Drive-Ins&quot;, &quot;Bob&#x27;s, Home of the Big Boy Hamburger&quot;, and (commonly as) Bob&#x27;s Big Boy. It became a local chain under that name and nationally under the Big Boy name, franchised by Robert C. Wian Enterprises; Wian only required franchisees to use &quot;Big Boy&quot; and not include his name &quot;Bob&#x27;s&quot;. Marriott Corporation bought Big Boy in 1967. One of the larger franchise operators, Elias Brothers, purchased the chain from Marriott in 1987, moved the headquarters of the company to Warren, Michigan, and operated it until bankruptcy was declared in 2000. During the bankruptcy, the chain was sold to investor Robert Liggett Jr., who took over as chairman, renamed the company Big Boy Restaurants International and maintained the headquarters in Warren. In 2018, Big Boy was sold to a group of Michigan investors and renamed Big Boy Restaurant Group, with David Crawford as chairman, CEO, and co-owner of the new company. In January 2020, Tamer Afr replaced Crawford as chairman, CEO, and co-owner. As of April 2024, the company operates 55 total locations in the United States: 51 &quot;Big Boy&quot; branded restaurants in Michigan, Nevada, North Dakota, and Ohio; and four additional locations in California branded as &quot;Bob&#x27;s Big Boy&quot;. One Big Boy location also operates in Thailand.

Immediately after Liggett&#x27;s purchase, Big Boy Restaurants International—then known as Liggett Restaurant Enterprises—negotiated an agreement with the other large franchise operator, Frisch&#x27;s Restaurants. The Big Boy trademarks in Kentucky, Indiana, and most of Ohio and Tennessee transferred to Frisch&#x27;s ownership; all other Frisch&#x27;s territories transferred to Liggett. Thus Frisch&#x27;s is no longer a franchisee; instead, Big Boy Restaurant Group and Frisch&#x27;s are now independent co-registrants of the Big Boy name and trademark. Frisch&#x27;s operates about 27 Big Boy restaurants in the United States, of which 9 are franchised.

Big Boy Japan, also independent of Big Boy Restaurant Group, operates 274 restaurants in Japan.

==Origin==
===Creation by Bob Wian===
In 1936, Bob Wian opened his first hamburger stand in Glendale, California, called Bob&#x27;s Pantry. There, he assembled his special double-decker hamburger. Created as a joke for a customer wanting something different, the novel hamburger began drawing business. The &quot;snappy&quot; name given to the popular sandwich provided a new name for his restaurant: Bob&#x27;s Big Boy.

In the late 1940s, Wian licensed two operators in the East to sell his Big Boy hamburger, Frisch&#x27;s Big Boy in Cincinnati and Eat&#x27;n Park Big Boy in Pittsburgh; this served Wian&#x27;s goal to procure and maintain a national trademark. In 1951, the third licensee Alex Schoenbaum of Shoney&#x27;s Big Boy sold Wian on a formal franchising system, and with the popularity of the drive-in restaurant, a series of franchising and subfranchising Big Boy followed in the 1950s. The franchisees were required to sell the Big Boy hamburger and use their own name with Big Boy, not Bob&#x27;s.

===The Big Boy mascot===

The chain is best known for its trademark chubby boy with a pompadour hairstyle wearing red-and-white checkered overalls holding a Big Boy sandwich (double-decker cheeseburger). The inspiration for Big Boy&#x27;s name, as well as the model for its mascot, was Richard Woodruff of Glendale, California. When he was six years old, Woodruff walked into the diner Bob&#x27;s Pantry as Bob Wian was attempting to name his new hamburger. Wian said, &quot;Hello, Big Boy&quot; to Woodruff, and the name stuck. Warner Bros. animation artist Ben Washam sketched Richard&#x27;s caricature, which became the character seen on the company trademark.

In 1955, Bob Wian hired Manfred Bernhard, son of graphic designer Lucian Bernhard, to create a new public image for Big Boy. Bernhard was not impressed with Washam&#x27;s mascot, saying it was sloppy and had a moronic expression. The &quot;West Coast Big Boy&quot; mascot was revised, fiberglass statues molded, schemes created for menus and building designs, and a comic book for children launched.

In 1951, Bob Wian&#x27;s original franchisee Dave Frisch developed a slightly different Big Boy character. He was slimmer, wore a side cap, saddle shoes and striped overalls. Having reddish or blonde hair, he was portrayed in a running pose. Known as the &quot;East Coast Big Boy&quot;, he was copyrighted by Frisch&#x27;s and used for statues and comic books for Frisch&#x27;s, and its subfranchisees Manners and Azar&#x27;s. Before 1954, Parkette (Shoney&#x27;s) used both versions, though never together. Since 1956, the Wian &quot;West Coast Big Boy&quot; design was used exclusively by all franchisees other than Frisch&#x27;s, Manners and Azar&#x27;s. In the late 1960s, both characters were redrawn to appear similar, incorporating the checkered outfit, pompadour and hamburger above the raised arm from the West Coast design, and the running pose and direction of the East Coast design. In the 1980s, the hamburger was removed from the West Coast design; representing a de-emphasis of the hamburger in North American Big Boy restaurants, it also accommodated the Japanese Big Boy restaurants, which do not serve hamburgers on a bun.

===Big Boy statues===

Early versions of the West Coast Big Boy statues were gigantic, measuring up to tall with later versions as short as . The early statues always included the Big Boy hamburger above the mascot&#x27;s raised right arm; much later versions eliminated the hamburger with both arms clutching the suspenders instead. The hamburger remained a part of the Frisch&#x27;s East Coast statues, though the slingshot was eliminated from the figure&#x27;s back pocket. Although still used by that chain, some Frisch&#x27;s restaurants currently display the West Coast statue instead.

Occasionally Big Boy statues have come into conflict with local zoning ordinances. In 2002, Tony Matar, a Big Boy franchisee in Canton, Michigan, was cited in violation of local sign ordinances. The town claimed the statue was a prohibited second sign; Matar asserted that the statue was a sculpture, not a sign. A 2004 compromise allows the existing statue to remain with the words &quot;Big Boy&quot; removed from the figure&#x27;s bib. When a Brighton, Michigan, franchise closed in early 2015 for financial reasons, zoning codes caused the entire signtopped with a rotating Big Boy statueto be taken down before the restaurant could be reopened. In contrast, the planning commission in Norco, California — known as &quot;Horsetown USA&quot; — was concerned that the statue was not Western enough. In response, the restaurant&#x27;s Big Boy statue is now outfitted wearing a cowboy hat and boots.

A few other modified statues are in official use. In Cincinnati&#x27;s Great American Ball Park, a Frisch&#x27;s statue is painted wearing a 1970s Reds baseball uniform with a Reds ballcap added. Frisch&#x27;s Big Boy hamburgers are sold at two of the park&#x27;s concession booths. Rather than modifying a typical statue, the Big Boy restaurants in Manistique and St. Ignace, Michigan, display full scale moose statues dressed in checkered overalls with &quot;Big Boy&quot; printed across the chest. To conform with Gaylord, Michigan&#x27;s, Alpine theme, the local restaurant&#x27;s statue previously wore a green Tyrolean hat. (The restaurant was rebuilt in 2016, and no longer displays the modified statue.)

In March 2017, Frisch&#x27;s unveiled a restyled statue. The new statue resembles the West Coast design but wears striped overalls like the original East Coast Big Boy. The debut statue wearing a Reds uniform is placed near the existing statue at Great American Ball Park; another is planned for an unnamed Frisch&#x27;s restaurant. Frisch&#x27;s will gradually swap the new statues for existing restaurant statues in need of repair.

Because of the closing or separation of former Big Boy restaurants, many West Coast statues were acquired by private individuals, and often traded through eBay. Smaller versions of the statues are sold as coin banks and bobblehead figures. The three-dimensional Big Boy figure was also used on early ashtrays, salt and pepper shakers, wooden counter displays and as small unpainted pewter models.

Gigantic air inflatable Big Boy figures are available and typically used for restaurant openings and special promotions.

===&quot;Adventures of the Big Boy&quot; comic book===


&quot;Adventures of the Big Boy&quot; (initially &quot;The Adventures of Big Boy&quot;) was a promotional comic book given free to children visiting the restaurants. Intended to &quot;give the kids something to do while they waited for their food&quot;, the book involves the escapades of Big Boy, his girlfriend Dolly and dog Nugget. From the comic books, children could also join the Big Boy Club, a kids&#x27; club offering them free Big Boy hamburgers, decoder cards, pin-back buttons and other premiums. The serial – sometimes called &quot;King of the Giveaways&quot; – once had distribution estimated at three million copies.

Manfred Bernhard commissioned Timely Comics to produce the book. In the first year, &quot;Adventures of the Big Boy&quot; was managed by Sol Brodsky, written by Stan Lee and drawn by Bill Everett, Brodsky, and Dan DeCarlo. DeCarlo continued drawing in the second year and Lee writing the series through 1961. For 17 years, starting in the mid-1970s, Manny Stallman drew the (Marriott) series, followed by Bob Bindig who drew the series until 1995.

====Variations====
Because of the distinct East and West Coast Big Boy mascots, dual versions of &quot;Adventures&quot; were produced, identical except for the detail of the Big Boy figure. In July 1969, the versions merged, and a fluffy brown haired Big Boy appeared. In 1976, Shoney&#x27;s began publishing their own series instead. Contracted to Paragon Products, this version featured an older, leaner Big Boy, with his siblings Katie and Tripp replacing Dolly and Nugget, and was adopted by the JB&#x27;s and Azar&#x27;s Big Boy franchises. After 75 issues, it became &quot;Shoney&#x27;s Fun and Adventure Magazine&quot; introducing a Shoney&#x27;s mascot (&quot;Uncle Ed&quot; bear) in place of Big Boy, allowing it to serve Shoney&#x27;s non-Big Boy restaurants.

====Cancellation====
In 1996, after 39 years and 466 issues, Big Boy cancelled the comic book and hired Craig Yoe&#x27;s Yoe! Studio to revamp the characters and produce a magazine-styled replacement. After 63 issues, the &quot;Big Boy Magazine&quot; was itself cancelled in 2008.

==Food==
===The Big Boy hamburger===
The signature Big Boy hamburger is the original double-deck hamburger.

The novel hamburger started as a joke. In February 1937, some local big band musicians, who were regular customers of Bob&#x27;s Pantry, visited the restaurant. When ordering, bass player Stewie Strange asked, &quot;How about something different, something &quot;special&quot;?&quot; [emphasis added]. Bob Wian improvised, creating the first (then unnamed) Big Boy, intending the thing &quot;look ridiculous, like a leaning tower&quot;. Demand for &quot;the special&quot; soared but Wian sought a &quot;snappy&quot; name, which became Big Boy. In 1938, the Big Boy hamburger cost 15¢ (). In 2018, the Big Boy cost $6.49 in Michigan.
Several slogans were used from the 1950s through the 1970s to promote the Big Boy hamburger, such as, &quot;A Meal in One on a Double–Deck Bun&quot; and &quot;Twice as Big, Twice as Good&quot;. On menus from that period, it was called, &quot;...the Nationally Famous, Original Double–Deck Hamburger...&quot;.

The Big Boy hamburger inspired and was the model for other double deck hamburgers. This includes McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac, Burger Chef&#x27;s Big Shef and Burger King&#x27;s Big King.

The Big Boy consists of two thin beef patties placed on a three-layer bun with lettuce, a single slice of American cheese, and either mayonnaise and red relish (a combination of sweet pickle relish, ketchup and chili sauce), Big Boy special sauce (often called thousand island dressing) or (at Frisch&#x27;s, Manners and Azar&#x27;s) tartar sauce on one or more layers of bun. (Regardless, the Big Boy condiment used was often simply referred to as &quot;special sauce&quot; on menus chainwide.) Wian used a sesame seed bun while Frisch&#x27;s used a plain bun and included pickles. The Big Boy hamburger originally called for a quarter pound (4 ounces) of fresh ground beef, but later, franchisees were permitted to use frozen beef patties, and the minimum content reduced to a fifth of a pound to offset increasing food costs. Other specifications were exacting, such as the bun&#x27;s bottom section being 1½  inches high and the center section ¾ inches, and 1½  ounces of shredded lettuce used.

Originally, the Big Boy hamburger was the only common menu item &quot;required&quot; of all Big Boy franchisees.

===Other core menu items===
Just as Bob Wian&#x27;s Big Boy hamburger was served by all franchises, the early franchises also contributed signature menu items. Frisch&#x27;s provided the &quot;Brawny Lad&quot; and &quot;Swiss Miss&quot; hamburgers, Shoney&#x27;s contributed the &quot;Slim Jim&quot; sandwich and Hot Fudge Ice Cream Cake, while Strawberry Pie was introduced by Eat&#x27;n Park. Hot Fudge Cake and Strawberry Pie remain popular dessert items chainwide but other items were not necessarily offered by all franchises, and franchises would sometimes change the item&#x27;s name: The &quot;Slim Jim&quot; became the &quot;Buddie Boy&quot; at Frisch&#x27;s, and Elby&#x27;s renamed the &quot;Swiss Miss&quot; as the &quot;Brawny Swiss&quot;. Similarly, when franchisees left Big Boy, they would typically rebrand the Big Boy hamburger: it became the &quot;Superburger&quot; (Eat&#x27;n Park), the &quot;Buddy Boy&quot; (Lendy&#x27;s), the &quot;Big Ben&quot; (Franklin&#x27;s), and the &quot;Elby Double Deck hamburger&quot; (Elby&#x27;s). Shoney&#x27;s reintroduced the &quot;Classic Double Decker&quot;, somewhat different than the Big Boy, about a decade after leaving.

Big Boy offers breakfast, burgers and sandwiches, salads, dinner combinations, and various desserts.

==Philosophy and practices==

Bob Wian developed rules and philosophies about how Big Boy should operate. Besides the Big Boy hamburger and its construction, he attributed most of his success and that of his franchisees to following these rules. His fundamental restaurant principles were: &quot;serve the best quality food, at moderate prices, in spotless surroundings, with courtesy and hospitality.&quot; He believed &quot;the customer is always right&quot; and instructed employees that, &quot;if any food item is not satisfactory, return it cheerfully and apologize for the error&quot;. Wian said he had five basic rules for building his business: &quot;be a good place to work for, sell to, buy from, and invest in. And be a good neighbor in the community.&quot; He also attributed the growth to, &quot;capable management and a conservative policy of not trying to seat more people than can be served or opening more restaurants than can be serviced.&quot; If some disruption occurred at a restaurant, such as a new manager or renovation, Wian would postpone advertising until operations would return to his standards.

Typical of Big Boy restaurants, Elby&#x27;s Big Boy used a nine-step process for waiting on dining room customers:
# Greet customers within one minute of being seated, serving water and taking beverage orders.
# Serve beverages and take meal orders.
# Call in meal orders to kitchen.
# Place setups (e.g., silverware) and condiments, serve salad items.
# Watch kitchen (number panel) for completed order and promptly serve meals to table.(The kitchen should complete orders within 8 minutes, 10 minutes for steaks.)
# Check back with customers within a few minutes: &quot;Is everything OK?&quot;
# Return and place check on the table: &quot;I&#x27;ll return shortly.&quot;
# Suggest dessert and take dessert orders.
# Serve desserts or deliver final check, remove empty dishes.

Bob Wian was discerning of employees, hiring wait staff—which he considered a profession—by appearance, intelligence and enthusiasm. He preferred employees with little or no restaurant experience which afforded training in the Big Boy tradition. Wian said that he &quot;conned [employees] into believing in themselves ... I put my cooks in chef&#x27;s outfits, even though they couldn&#x27;t boil an egg&quot;. Other than wait staff, employees typically started as dishwashers and busboys, and advanced to short-order cooks, and then possibly to management. Bob&#x27;s Big Boy was one of the first restaurant chains to offer health insurance and profit-sharing to employees.

Bob Wian excelled at franchise relations. He led 20-person training crews to open new Big Boy restaurants, made periodic nationwide tours of the franchises, was available for consultations and claimed to know every manager&#x27;s name. He also assembled the principal franchisees as board members of the National Big Boy Association to participate in leadership. After Wian left, some Big Boy operators began to question the value of their franchise.

==Regional franchises==

===Operation and history===
In addition to the Big Boy name, the &quot;Big Boy&quot; concept, menu, and mascot were originally licensed to a wide number of regional franchise holders (listed in the next section). Because many of the early franchisees were already in the restaurant business when joining Big Boy, &quot;Big Boy&quot; was added to the franchisee name just as the Big Boy hamburger was added to the franchisee&#x27;s menu. In this sense, it is confusing when referring to a chain, as each named franchisee was itself a chain and Big Boy could be considered a chain of chains. People tend to know Big Boy not simply as Big Boy but as the franchise from where they lived such as Bob&#x27;s Big Boy in California, Shoney&#x27;s Big Boy in the south or Frisch&#x27;s Big Boy in much of Ohio, Marc&#x27;s Big Boy in the Upper Midwest, Elias Brothers&#x27; Big Boy (or sometimes just Elias Brothers&#x27;) in Michigan, among many others.

Each regional franchisee typically operated a central commissary which prepared or processed foods and sauces to be shipped fresh to their restaurants. However, some items might be prepared at the restaurants daily, such as soups and breading of seafood and onion rings.

Through the 1950s and 1960s, the emphasis changed from drive-in restaurant to coffee shop and family restaurant. New franchisees without existing restaurants signed on. A larger standard menu was developed. Most adopted a common graphic design of menus and promotional items, offered by Big Boy but personalized to the franchise. Stock plans of restaurant designs were provided by Los Angeles architects Armet and Davis or Chicago architectural designer Robert O. Burton, and modified as needed.

In the 1960s, Big Boy and other drive-in restaurants could not compete with the spreading fast food restaurants such as McDonald&#x27;s and Burger King. Big Boy built its last drive-in in 1964 and, by 1976, only 5 of the chain&#x27;s 930 restaurants offered curb service. Big Boy redefined itself as a full service restaurant in contrast to fast food. Nonetheless, in the late 1960s and 1970s, Bob&#x27;s, Shoney&#x27;s and JB&#x27;s also opened Big Boy Jr. stores, designed as fast food operations which offered a limited menu. Sometimes called drive-ins, these junior stores did not use carhops. In 1993, Marc&#x27;s Big Boy similarly developed Big Boy Express stores using dual drive-thrus and no interior dining area. Two Express stores were built, offered for sale a year later and closed in 1995.

Several franchises also held Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises and sold that chicken in their Big Boy restaurants; these included Marc&#x27;s, McDowell&#x27;s, Lendy&#x27;s and one or more Shoney&#x27;s subfranchises. The practice was discouraged and Big Boy eventually provided a similar scheme of selling buckets of take out chicken, marketed as Country Style or Country Cousin Chicken. Franchises who resisted the change were forced to remove Kentucky Fried Chicken menu items and physically relocate those operations. However, Marriott sold &quot;Pappy Parker Fried Chicken&quot; in Bob&#x27;s Big Boys; the Marriott owned brand was also sold in the company&#x27;s Hot Shoppes and Roy Rogers Restaurants, and later Marriott Hotel Restaurants.

Big Boy&#x27;s origins as a drive-in restaurant required a much smaller investment to open and much lower costs to operate: a small building having no dining room or limited counter space. Thus persons of modest assets could become Big Boy operators. It was the profits from these operations which allowed not only additional drive-ins, but allowed operators to build modern restaurants with large pleasant dining rooms. Many of the early successful franchisees would probably not have assets (converted to present value) sufficient to join Big Boy today.

By 1979, there were more than a thousand Big Boy restaurants in the U.S. and Canada, and about 20 franchisees. Shoney&#x27;s, Elias Brothers and Frisch&#x27;s—charter franchisees—controlled the vast majority. These mega franchisees paid practically no fees, e.g., Frisch paid $1 per year for its core four state territory. After Bob&#x27;s, the four original franchisees (in order) were Frisch&#x27;s, Eat&#x27;n Park, Shoney&#x27;s (originally called &quot;Parkette&quot;) and Elias Brothers, all clustered near the state of Ohio. All, including Bob&#x27;s, remain in operation today, albeit Elias Brothers is simply known as Big Boy, and Eat&#x27;n Park and Shoney&#x27;s dropped Big Boy affiliation in the 1970s and 1980s.

Big Boy developed named franchisees in several ways. Very quickly the Big Boy name and even the Big Boy character were being widely used without permission. Bob Wian, needing Big Boy restaurants operating in multiple states to maintain national (U.S.) trademark protection, offered very generous franchise agreements to Frisch&#x27;s, Eat&#x27;n Park and Parkette (Shoney&#x27;s). In 1952, Wian instituted a formal franchise process and Elias Brothers became the first such &quot;official&quot; franchisee paying Wian 1% of sales. Bob Wian also settled trademark infringements allowing the rogue operator to become a licensed franchisee, such as McDowell&#x27;s Big Boy in North Dakota. Franchisees were permitted to subfranchise; these early subfranchisees often used their own name and operated independently: Frisch&#x27;s licensed Azar&#x27;s, and Manners; Shoney&#x27;s licensed Adler&#x27;s, Arnold&#x27;s, Becker&#x27;s, Elby&#x27;s, Lendy&#x27;s, Shap&#x27;s, Tune&#x27;s, and Yoda&#x27;s. (An eastern Pennsylvania Elby&#x27;s franchisee briefly operated as Franklin&#x27;s Big Boy before dropping Big Boy.)

Acquisitions and mergers also occurred. In the early 1970s, Frisch&#x27;s acquired Kip&#x27;s Big Boy; JB&#x27;s acquired Vip&#x27;s, Kebo&#x27;s, Leo&#x27;s and Bud&#x27;s which were rebranded JB&#x27;s. Shoney&#x27;s acquired the Missouri territory previously assigned to Tote&#x27;s. After buying Big Boy, Elias Brothers bought Elby&#x27;s and TJ&#x27;s. Elby&#x27;s was unique in leaving and rejoining the Big Boy system. When Marriott purchased Big Boy (Wian Enterprises) in 1967, this included Bob&#x27;s Big Boy. The name &quot;Bob&#x27;s&quot; would be used by all Marriott owned Big Boys and became common in parts of the eastern U.S. and elsewhere, far away from Bob&#x27;s historic territory.

Frisch&#x27;s now owns the &quot;Big Boy&quot; name in a defined four-state region and its franchisee Azar&#x27;s closed in 2020. Bob&#x27;s is licensed Big Boy Restaurant Group. Many of the other former franchise owners (Shoney&#x27;s, particularly) have expanded into the former territories of other franchise holders.

After buying the Big Boy system from Marriott, Elias Brothers planned to phase out franchise names, only generally realized by Big Boy Restaurants International after 2000. This was intended to strengthen the trademark but also prevent defections, such as happened with Shoney&#x27;s Big Boy retaining identity as Shoney&#x27;s. The same occurred with Eat&#x27;n Park, Elby&#x27;s, Lendy&#x27;s, JB&#x27;s, and Abdow&#x27;s who kept their names after leaving Big Boy. Big Boy now permits operators to informally identify by location such as &quot;Tawas Bay Big Boy&quot; in East Tawas, Michigan.

Unlike most modern franchises, the historic Big Boy franchisees differed somewhat from one another in pricing and menus. After purchasing Big Boy in 1987, Elias Brothers intended to standardize the name and menu, but Bob&#x27;s, Frisch&#x27;s and McDowell&#x27;s (now known as Bismarck Big Boy) continue to offer distinctions from the standard Big Boy menu.

===Franchising costs today===
Big Boy Restaurant Group and Frisch&#x27;s Big Boy Restaurants both continue to offer franchises in their exclusive territories, each having 20 year terms. As of 2023, Big Boy Restaurant Group charged a $50,000 franchise fee and an ongoing 4% royalty and up to 3% advertising fees based on weekly gross revenue. (In most of Michigan, the franchisee pays a 2% advertising fee and must spend an additional 1% on local advertising. Franchisees in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan or outside of Michigan pay a ½% advertising fee and must spend 1½% on local advertising.) As of 2020, Frisch&#x27;s Big Boy charges a $40,000–$45,000 franchise fee, and an ongoing 4% royalty and 2½% advertising fees on gross revenue. The majority of Big Boy Restaurant Group units are franchised while the majority of Frisch&#x27;s units are currently company owned. Big Boy Restaurant Group franchise agreements are not renewable but new agreements are required.

===Roster of named franchisees===
Big Boy restaurants were cobranded with at least 34 different names representing various franchisees. These franchisees are listed below with territories, time span, founders, comic book code (in brackets) and additional notes, as known:
*Abdow&#x27;s (Western and Central Massachusetts, Connecticut, 19631994, founded by George and Ron Abdow and their sister Phyllis Abdow-LaVallee) Abdow&#x27;s opened as a Hi-Boy franchisee in 1959, bought a Big Boy franchise in 1963 and changed the corporate name to Abdow&#x27;s Big Boy in 1965. Abdow&#x27;s left Big Boy in 1994 over menu conflicts with Elias Brothers and value served for the franchise fees, removing 18 restaurants from the national chain. Now defunct, many converted to Elxsi Corporations&#x27;s Bickfords Family Restaurants or remain vacant. [N]
*Adler&#x27;s (Lynchburg, Virginia, 1958–1960, founded by Abe Adler) Became a Lendy&#x27;s Big Boy, when Adler sold the business to Leonard Goldstein of Lendy&#x27;s.
*Arnold&#x27;s (Folsom, Pennsylvania, 1955–?, founders unknown) Arnold&#x27;s and Tune&#x27;s operated in the Philadelphia area.
*Azar&#x27;s (Northern Indiana, Colorado, 1953–2020, founded by brothers Alex, David and George Azar) Opened in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, as a Frisch&#x27;s subfranchise and in 1967 expanded to the Denver, Colorado, market. Operated 26 units in 1984. Alex Azar&#x27;s son, George Azar, became CEO. After closing during the COVID-19 pandemic, the last Azar&#x27;s Big Boy closed permanently. Alex Azar became a member of the Big Boy Board of Directors. [T]
*Becker&#x27;s (Rochester and Buffalo, New York, 19561965, founded by Abe Becker) Shoney&#x27;s opened a restaurant in Rochester in the mid-1950s which may have become Becker&#x27;s Big Boy. By 1957, Becker&#x27;s was operating four Big Boy restaurants in Greater Rochester. Trying to expand too quickly created a financial crisis and the end of the franchise.

*Bob&#x27;s (California, Arizona, Nevada, Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Vermont; and Indiana, Ohio, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania toll roads and airport locations operated in several states by the Marriott Corp. or others, 1936+, founded by Robert C. &quot;Bob&quot; Wian) The original Big Boy chain, which in Wian&#x27;s time was confined to Southern California, Arizona and Nevada. Because Marriott developed and acquired Big Boy restaurants elsewhere, principally the northeastern U.S., Bob&#x27;s developed a more diverse territory and identity. Bob&#x27;s in Nevada and Arizona were purchased by JB&#x27;s Big Boy. Currently, Bob&#x27;s operates only five restaurants – all in Southern California. Bob&#x27;s units are the only operators under the domain of the Big Boy Restaurant Group now permitted to use a franchise name for public identity. Wian was the original chairman of the Big Boy Board of Directors. [A]
*Bud&#x27;s (Montana, Wyoming, 1966197?) Operated two units. Acquired by JBs in the 1970s.
*Chez Chap (Westmount, a suburb of Montreal, Quebec, 1978?, founded by Chapman Baehler) Baehler was Bob Wian&#x27;s stepson.
*Don&#x27;s (Burlington, Vermont, 1984, founded by Donald Allard) One of several chain restaurants operated by Allard. Restaurant was rebranded as Bob&#x27;s Big Boy about 1986, and closed, with plans to construct a Red Lobster Restaurant on the site in 1991. As of 2020, there has been an Olive Garden on that site for some years.
*Eat&#x27;n Park (metro Pittsburgh, 19491975, founded by Larry Hatch and William Peters) Hatch and Peters were supervisors at Isaly&#x27;s in Pittsburgh. On Isaly&#x27;s business in Cincinnati, Hatch saw the success of the Frisch&#x27;s Big Boy Drive-In prompting contact with founder Bob Wian, who needed national exposure to gain national trademark protection. Within a year Eat&#x27;n Park opened as the second Big Boy franchisee. When the 25 year franchise agreement expired Eat&#x27;n Park dropped Big Boy, attributed to the loss of drive-in popularity but primarily motivated by the end of the $1 per year license fee the franchise had enjoyed. Pittsburgh area Big Boy rights were reassigned to Elby&#x27;s in 1977. [D]
*Elby&#x27;s (Northern West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Eastern Ohio, Maryland, 19561984, 19882000, founded by brothers George, Ellis and Michael Boury) Named after a brand of flavoring syrup sold by the Bourys&#x27; restaurant supply business. Originally acquired the Big Boy rights to northern West Virginia through Shoney&#x27;s. In 1960 Elby&#x27;s expanded into Ohio, licensed through Frisch&#x27;s. Six years later, Bob Wian awarded Elby&#x27;s franchisor rights to Pennsylvania, excluding the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia areas; Pittsburgh was awarded Elby&#x27;s in 1977. When Frisch&#x27;s refused existing terms on a fourth Ohio unit in 1971, Elby&#x27;s withdrew from Big Boy affiliation in Ohio, leading to a long running trademark battle by Frisch&#x27;s. In August 1984 Elby&#x27;s paid $500 thousand to buy out its Big Boy franchise, four months after Shoney&#x27;s—franchisor for Elby&#x27;s West Virginia stores—broke affiliation. Opened units in Maryland after leaving Big Boy. The Elby&#x27;s name and most company restaurants were sold to Elias Brothers in 1988 becoming Big Boys again. (George and Michael Boury retained nine Ohio units that could not become Big Boys because of nearby Frisch&#x27;s operations; they were rebranded as Shoney&#x27;s restaurants until placed for sale in 1993.) Although officially stripped of the Elby&#x27;s name, identity was so strong that the Elby&#x27;s name continued in print advertisements. The last remaining Elby&#x27;s closed in 2000 in response to the Elias Brothers financial crisis. [E]
*Elias Brothers (Michigan, Northeastern Ohio, Ontario, Canada, 19522000, founded by Fred, John and Louis Elias) In 1938 the brothers opened Fred&#x27;s Chili Bowl in Detroit and later the Dixie Drive-In in Hazel Park, which would become the first Elias Brothers Big Boy. Considered the &quot;first official franchisee&quot; because they were the first to formally apply to Bob Wian. They worked with Wian, Schoenbaum and Manfred Bernhard to create the 1956 Big Boy character design and launch the comic book. Owned the Big Boy system from 1987 through 2000 when the bankrupt company was sold to Robert Liggett. Many Michigan units continue operations stripped of the Elias Brothers name and these are the vast majority (90%) of Big Boy Restaurant Group&#x27;s Big Boy stores. Fred Elias became a member of the Big Boy Board of Directors. [F]
*Franklin&#x27;s (Eastern Pennsylvania, 19661976, founded by Marvin and Joseph Franklin) Subfranchised by and originally operated as Elby&#x27;s. Sued Elby&#x27;s in 1975 for receiving commissions from approved vendors. inflating prices of supplies, and using continued franchising as an incentive. Elby&#x27;s denied the charges, which were settled out of court in 1978. Franklin discontinued use of the Elby&#x27;s name in 1976, but initially continued to operate as Big Boy Restaurants. Elby&#x27;s sued Franklin&#x27;s. In August 1978, a federal court cancelled Franklin&#x27;s contracts with Elby&#x27;s, awarded Elby&#x27;s an undisclosed cash settlement and enjoined Franklin&#x27;s from use of the &quot;Elby&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Big Boy&quot; names, food items, recipes and other materials. Nonetheless, Franklin&#x27;s renamed the &quot;Big Boy&quot; the &quot;Big Ben&quot; and adopted a Benjamin Franklin theme. Elby&#x27;s subsequently built new restaurants adjacent to several Franklin&#x27;s units. The 12 unit chain was sold to Hershey&#x27;s Foods and Friendly&#x27;s Restaurants in 1985.
*Frejlach&#x27;s (Illinois, 1954196?, founded by Irvin Frejlach) Added Big Boy to their established chain of ice cream shops. Unlike other franchisees, the stores did not directly use the Big Boy name; they remained Frejlach&#x27;s Ice Cream Shoppes not Frejlach&#x27;s Big Boy. The company also owned rights to McDonald&#x27;s restaurants in Cook County (Chicago), Illinois which were sold back to Ray Kroc in 1956. Irvin&#x27;s brother Lucian &quot;Lou&quot; Frejlach became a member of the Big Boy Board of Directors.
*Frisch&#x27;s (Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee; Florida until the early 1990s, 1947+, founded by David Frisch) The Cincinnati restaurant chain and first franchisee, began serving Big Boy hamburgers in 1946, but opened their first Big Boy Drive-In restaurant in 1948; Frisch&#x27;s now operates 96 Big Boys and franchises 25 Big Boys to others. Frisch&#x27;s subfranchised to Azar&#x27;s and Manners, which used the Frisch&#x27;s styled Big Boy, to Milton and David Bennett in 1955, who operate as Frisch&#x27;s in northwest Ohio and also licensed Elby&#x27;s to operate three Big Boy units in the upper Ohio Valley until 1971. In 2001 Frisch&#x27;s became the perpetual owner of the Big Boy trademark in most of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and Tennessee, and received $1.2 million to relinquish all other Big Boy territories to Big Boy Restaurants International, to whom Frisch&#x27;s is no longer a franchisee or licensee. On August 24, 2015, Frisch&#x27;s was sold to an Atlanta-based private equity fund, ending family ownership and control of the chain. [X]
*JB&#x27;s (Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming, Washington, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Nebraska, Kansas, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut; 19611988, founded by Jack M. Broberg.) The first JB&#x27;s Big Boy opened in 1961 in Provo, Utah. In the 1970s JB&#x27;s expanded by acquiring neighboring Big Boy franchisees: Vip&#x27;s, Leo&#x27;s, Kebo&#x27;s and Bud&#x27;s. After Marriott refused granting additional territory, in 1984, JB&#x27;s sued to leave Big Boy. The parties settled, JB&#x27;s paying $7 million in exchange for additional territory, including central and northern California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Arizona where it operated as Bob&#x27;s Big Boy; JB&#x27;s also purchased 29 existing Bob&#x27;s Big Boy restaurants from Marriott. Citing a lack of benefit except use of the Big Boy symbol for its over $1 million annual franchise fees, in 1988 JB&#x27;s allowed its Big Boy franchise to expire, removing 110 units from the Big Boy system. As of December 2016, fifteen JB&#x27;s Restaurants operate in five states. [H]
*JB&#x27;s (Canada - Ontario, Alberta and Quebec, 19691979, founded by John Bitove Sr.) Bitove, a well-known Canadian businessman, was the franchisee for Canada generally, along with Roy Rogers Restaurants, both Marriott owned brands. JB&#x27;s of Canada grew to 32 Big Boy restaurants before selling to Elias Brothers.
*Kebo&#x27;s (Seattle and Tacoma, Washington area before JB&#x27;s dba Bob&#x27;s, ?1974, founded by W. Keith Grant.) &quot;Kebo&quot; came from the owners, Keith, Ed and Bob. Two units were sold to JB&#x27;s in 1974.
*Ken&#x27;s (Maryland, Washington DC, 1963?, founded by Bill Bemis) named in honor of Bill Bemis&#x27; father Ken Bemis, who founded the White Log Coffee Shop chain. Three Maryland &quot;Ken&#x27;s Big Boys&quot; operated in 1969. &quot;Ken&#x27;s&quot; became &quot;Bob&#x27;s&quot; in the early 1970s. [K]
*Kip&#x27;s (Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, 19581991, founded Fred Bell, Thomas W. Holman and James Reed) Bell owned and operated Kip&#x27;s of Texas, while Holman and Reed owned and operated Kip&#x27;s of Oklahoma and Kansas. Acquired by Frisch&#x27;s in 1972. Kip&#x27;s territory was transferred to Big Boy Restaurants International in 2001. Bell became an original member of the Big Boy Board of Directors. [B]
*Lendy&#x27;s (Western Virginia, 19551964, founded by Leonard Goldstein) Owned by Goldstein but operated as Shoney&#x27;s 1955–1959. Territory proximity to Yoda&#x27;s angered Goldstein and concurrent franchise with Kentucky Fried Chicken antagonized franchisor Alex Schoenbaum, prompting Lendy&#x27;s to leave Big Boy. Renamed the &quot;Big Boy&quot; hamburger as the &quot;Buddy Boy&quot; and created a Buddy Boy mascot similar to Frisch&#x27;s Big Boy character. Goldstein replaced the Big Boy statues with statues of Buddy Boy.
*Leo&#x27;s (Spokane, Washington, Montana, 19661971, founded by Leo A. Hansen Jr.) The first Leo&#x27;s Big Boy opened in Great Falls, Montana in 1966. Grew to four units before being acquired by and renamed JB&#x27;s in 1971, Hansen becoming a vice-president of JB&#x27;s Big Boy.
*Manners (Northeastern Ohio (Cleveland TV market), 19541979, founded by Robert L. and Ramona Manners) Franchisee through Frisch&#x27;s, used the Frisch styled mascot design. Like Frisch&#x27;s, Manners was already established having opened Manners Drive-In in 1939, 15 years before becoming a Big Boy franchisee. Paid Frisch&#x27;s $10 per month for each location. In 1968 Manners Big Boy was sold to Consolidated Foods (now known as Sara Lee Corporation). Marriott purchased the 39 units in 1974 and five years later dropped the name &quot;Manners&quot;. Marriott sold 26 remaining restaurants to Elias Brothers in 1985. [W]
*Marc&#x27;s (Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, 19581995, founded by Ben Marcus and Gene Kilburg) Owned by the Marcus Corporation, Marc&#x27;s Big Boy debuted in Milwaukee in November 1958. The chain grew to 4 units by 1962, 22 units by 1970, doubling this number within 4 years and eventually operated as many as 64 Big Boys over a 4 state territory. Among these, acquiring Illinois Top&#x27;s Big Boy restaurants by 1974—rebranding those in Chicago suburbs Marc&#x27;s. In 1989, Marc&#x27;s Big Boy Corporation was renamed Marc&#x27;s Restaurants and a two-year experiment launched completely removing Big Boy at two of its stores, the test demonstrating no effect on business. In 1992, the Marc&#x27;s format was upscaled and renamed &quot;Marc&#x27;s Big Boy Cafe&quot;s; in 1993 13 Big Boy Cafes were converted to &quot;Marc&#x27;s Cafe and Coffee Mill&quot;s, and the company launched 2 &quot;Big Boy Express&quot; drive-thru stores. The following year, the 13 Cafe and Coffee Mill restaurants were sold to a group of employees, with 3 remaining Big Boys and 2 Big Boy Express units offered for sale. In 1995, the company closed its last Big Boy operation. Some former units later operated as Annie&#x27;s American Cafe and as Perkins Restaurants. However, in 2017 the Marcus Corporation sold Big Boy hamburgers at the Kil@wat restaurant in its downtown Milwaukee hotel; in March 2017, the sandwich is priced at $11 on the lunch menu and $12 on the dinner menu both served with fries. [J] Now known as Aria Café and Bar at Saint Kate hotel, as of 2024 the Big Boy goes for $18. [J]
*Mark&#x27;s (Hyattsville, Maryland, 19601962?) A single unit existed at 3050 East-West Parkway, Hyattsville, which was a Ken&#x27;s Big Boy in 1964.
*McDowell&#x27;s (North Dakota, 19541960 independently as &quot;Big Boy Drive-Inn&quot;, 1960+ as franchise, founded by Harley McDowell) A trademark infringement suit against McDowell was filed by Wian in 1959 ultimately resulting in a franchise agreement. Operates exclusively as a drive through. McDowell&#x27;s name was dropped and the remaining store is now called the Bismarck Big Boy. Along with Big Boy hamburgers, the single restaurant sells flying pizza-burgers and french fries by the pound with chicken gravy. [L]
*Mr. B&#x27;s (New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, 19631969, founded by Manfred Bernhard) Operated a restaurant in Keene, New Hampshire and Brattleboro, Vermont.
* Shap&#x27;s (Chattanooga, Tennessee, 19591964?, founded by I. Shapiro, Pem Cooley, and E. D. Latimer) Franchised by Shoney&#x27;s. Shap&#x27;s was abbreviated for Shapiro&#x27;s. Operated two small units in Chattanooga. Latimer bought out the other partners and changed the name to its franchisor&#x27;s, Shoney&#x27;s.
* Shoney&#x27;s/Parkette (Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, West Virginia, Maryland, Missouri, New York, Philadelphia, PA, 19521984, founded by Alex Schoenbaum), Originally called the Parkette, in 1952 it became Parkette Big Boy Shoppes. An unrelated &quot;Parkette Drive-In&quot; had opened in Kentucky so in 1954, a public contest for a new name resulted in Parkette becoming Shoney&#x27;s, which was also a reference to founder Alex &quot;Shoney&quot; Schoenbaum. Shoney&#x27;s also subfranchised to Arnold&#x27;s, Becker&#x27;s, Elby&#x27;s, Lendy&#x27;s, Shap&#x27;s, Tune&#x27;s, and Yoda&#x27;s., and many using the Shoney&#x27;s name. Ray Danner, the Nashville Shoney&#x27;s franchisee purchased the company in 1971 and five years later dropped Big Boy from the company name. In April 1984 Shoney&#x27;s—by then the largest Big Boy franchisee with 392 units—paid $13 million to break its contract with Big Boy, allowing expansion into Frisch&#x27;s and other franchisees&#x27; Big Boy territories. Schoenbaum became a member of the Big Boy Board of Directors. [M][P]
*Ted&#x27;s (Rhode Island, 1964–?, founded by Edmund D. Fuller III)
*TJ&#x27;s (Rochester, Batavia and Syracuse, New York, 1972?, founded by Anthony T. Kolinski, John Gazda and John Giamartino) Grew to 9 stores by 1986. TJ&#x27;s was purchased by Big Boy (Elias Brothers). Elias closed 4 stores in 1992 and sold one Syracuse store to a local investor. It closed 3 more Syracuse restaurants in 1994.
*Tops (Illinois, 19561993, founded by Lucian Frejlach) Operated primarily in the suburbs of Chicago. By 1974, the Chicago area stores became Marc&#x27;s Big Boys, while the central Illinois units remained Tops. [Q]
*Tote&#x27;s (Missouri, 1964–197?, founded by Edward R. Todtenbier) Todtenbier was a Frisch&#x27;s franchisee in Anderson, Indiana, and planned to open 33 Tote&#x27;s Big Boys in Missouri, 9 in the St. Louis area. In 1972 the Missouri Big Boy territory was reassigned to Shoney&#x27;s. [U]
*Tune&#x27;s (Philadelphia and Levittown, Pennsylvania, 1956–1963, founded by Jack Engel) In the mid to late 1950s Alex Schoenbaum seeded various franchises including Tune&#x27;s. Two drive-in restaurants opened. By the early 1960s, the Levittown unit closed and the other was rebranded as Shoney&#x27;s.
*Vip&#x27;s (New Mexico, Texas, Wyoming, 19621982. founded by Daniel T. Hogan and James O&#x27;Conner) Vip&#x27;s refers to two distinct restaurant chains. The Big Boy franchisee relevant here, &quot;Vip&#x27;s Big Boy of New Mexico&quot;, was acquired by JB&#x27;s Big Boy in 1972 but continued using the Vip&#x27;s name until rebranded in 1982. The other, Vip&#x27;s Restaurants of Salem, Oregon, was &quot;not&quot; a Big Boy franchisee but sold units to JB&#x27;s Big Boy, which operated them as Bob&#x27;s Big Boy. The non-Big Boy, Salem-based chain had 53 locations at its peak, all sold and rebranded, including 35 to Denny&#x27;s in 1982 and 16 to JB&#x27;s in 1984. [R]
*Yoda&#x27;s (Western Virginia, founded by Jack Young and Bill Schroeder) Young was Leonard Goldstein&#x27;s (Lendy&#x27;s) brother-in-law. Merged with Lendy&#x27;s.

===Outside the United States===
Mady&#x27;s Big Boy of Windsor, Ontario, was &quot;not&quot; a franchisee, though sometimes identified as one and using a similar looking mascot. In 1965 Bob Wian sued Mady&#x27;s for trademark infringement but failed because (his) Big Boy was judged not widely known in Canada. The case is considered important in Canadian and international trademark law. In 1973 Elias Brothers bought Mady&#x27;s and established an Elias Big Boy on Mady&#x27;s original site. John Bitove Sr. owned the rights to Big Boy for the remainder of Canada, which he sold to Elias Brothers in 1979. During the mid to late 1980&#x27;s there was one in Nassau, Bahamas.

Big Boy also operated (or planned to open) restaurants in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Brazil, the Philippines and Thailand.

====Japan====
Outside of North America, Big Boy Japan owns and operates 274 Big Boy Hamburger Steak &amp; Grill Restaurants in Japan. Founded in 1977, Big Boy Japan now also operates 45 Victoria Station restaurants in Japan and is a subsidiary of Zénsho Holdings Co., Ltd. The Japanese Big Boy Restaurants do not offer the Big Boy hamburger or most other American Big Boy menu items, offering a distinct menu instead. They also offer beer and wine. Zensho had purchased Big Boy Japan from the ailing Daiei in 2002 for 8.65 billion yen. Like Frisch, Big Boy Japan operates independently of the Big Boy Restaurant Group.

====Southeast Asia and Western Pacific====
In 2019, Singapore-based Destination Eats signed a franchise agreement with the Big Boy Restaurant Group to initially open restaurants in Thailand, and later in Australia, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore, and the Philippines. In May 2020, the first Thai Big Boy restaurant opened in Bangkok, operated as a delivery only service due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A second restaurant was opened in Pattaya in October 2020. The company is obligated to open 70 restaurants in its overall territory.

A previous franchise briefly operated at the beginning of the 21st century with three Big Boy restaurants in Bangkok and one in the southern beach town of Pattaya, but the business ultimately failed because the native Thai customers did not understand nor appreciate American-style food at that time. The restaurants adapted the menu to local tastes. Some Thai customers regarded the Big Boy statues as religious icons or had superstitions about them.

=== Big Boy Restaurants International ===
The previous Michigan-based owner of the Big Boy chain, which chiefly franchised previous Elias Brothers Big Boy restaurants in Michigan, has suffered a gradual loss of franchised restaurants. About 175 Big Boys existed in July 2006, compared to 76 in July 2019.

On April 16, 2017, the last Big Boy restaurant in the city of Detroit closed. The Big Boy in Fenton, Michigan, was expected to close in 2017. Both properties have been sold to developers. Likewise, in 2016, the Jackson, Michigan, Big Boy closed after the site was purchased by a developer.

Other franchisees simply left the Big Boy chain. In April 2017, the Danville Big Boy, the only unit in Illinois, dropped Big Boy and rebranded as the Border Cafe. In 2016 both the Ann Arbor, Michigan, restaurant (on North Zeeb Road) and the restaurant in Houghton Lake, Michigan, continued to operate but not as Big Boy restaurants. The Tecumseh and Alma, Michigan restaurants announced they will allow their franchise agreements to expire on November 1, 2017, and early 2018, respectively, and both will continue to operate independently. The Marine City, Michigan, Big Boy closed in February 2018, to reopen independently by a new owner. However, in the same month, Big Boy added a new franchisee, an existing restaurant reopening as a Big Boy, in Woodhaven, Michigan. In April 2018, the Coldwater, Michigan, location closed, media sources noting multiple health code violations and poor customer reviews.

Company-owned restaurants have also closed for under-performance.

===Big Boy Restaurant Group===
In 2018, Big Boy was sold to a group of Michigan investors and renamed Big Boy Restaurant Group. The company moved its headquarters from Warren to nearby Southfield in 2020.

In August 2020, a partnership was announced with Terrible Herbst to expand into Southern Nevada. On November 8, 2020, the first Big Boy restaurant opened in Indian Springs, Nevada. A second Big Boy opened in May 2022 in the Centennial Hills neighborhood of Las Vegas; called Big Boy Tavern, it includes a bar and small casino area. In June 2021, it was reported that a Big Boy restaurant will open on July 14, 2021, in Germantown, Wisconsin, a Milwaukee suburb. The franchisees will also operate two Big Boy food trucks and plan to open additional Big Boy restaurants in southeastern Wisconsin over a three-year period. The grand opening was pushed back to July 21 due to equipment shipping delays.

Big Boy Restaurants International tried a new fast casual concept known as Big Boy&#x27;s Burgers and Shakes. The restaurant opened in 2016 in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, operated in strip mall instead of a larger traditional stand-alone building. The restaurant was closed by January 2020.

In November 2020, the Big Boy restaurant in Sandusky, Michigan, was stripped of its franchise when it refused to comply with Michigan&#x27;s COVID-19 restrictions. It now operates as Sandusky Family Diner.

In June 2023, Big Boy began to open restaurants with no table service and a fast-food menu and, harkening to their origin, called them Bob&#x27;s Big Boy. The first two locations announced are in Michigan in the Detroit suburb of Farmington and Lansing.

On February 14th, 2025, the owners of Frisch’s Big Boy, known as “New Frisch’s” sued Big Boy Restaurant Group for allegedly negotiating with NNN REIT to reopen formerly closed locations as “Big Boy”, which violates the agreement settled with the parent organization in 2001.

<text>The annual Simulated Emergency Test (SET) is a training exercise involving the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) and the National Traffic System (NTS), a message-handling service of amateur radio. The American Radio Relay League is a prime mover in this event, which is organized somewhat like a contest. Its primary purposes are to evaluate strengths and weaknesses in emergency preparedness and communications, and to demonstrate amateur radio to the public.

During the first full weekend of October of every year in the United States, a nationwide radio communications network is set up that links every major city and most of the geography of the country. This technological infrastructure is set up from scratch within a few hours at locations that vary from state and local government Emergency Operations Centers to isolated areas without utilities of any kind. Every mode of radio communications is utilized including analog, digital, voice, data, simplex, duplex, satellites and even automated relay stations launched on aircraft and with weather balloons. For no more than 48 continuous hours, this nationwide radio communications network is exercised with the primary objective of proving the system&#x27;s readiness and capabilities. Then as quickly as it was set up, the system is dismantled and stored in preparation for when it is needed. The system has demonstrated its value time after time during earthquakes, hurricanes, forest fires, terrorist attacks and other disasters. All of this capability is provided by volunteers who continuously hone their technical skills and acquire, build, and maintain their own equipment. These radio engineers and operators, along with their equipment, combine into an important resource for emergency communications.

In India, Vigyan Prasar (an apex body for science popularization under the Department of Science and Technology coordinates simulated disaster communication exercises and also organizes trainings to help people getting ham radio licenses in areas which are vulnerable to natural calamities.

<text>Life is a breakfast cereal produced by the Quaker Oats Company. Introduced in 1961, the cereal has a brown, checked square pattern and mainly consists of oat flour, corn flour, added sugar, and whole-wheat flour. , because of the numerous varieties the cereal has, the original cereal is now marketed as &quot;Life Original Multigrain Cereal&quot;.

== Ingredients ==
The cereal itself contains whole grain oat flour, corn flour, sugar, whole wheat flour, calcium carbonate, salt, baking soda, tocopherols (for artificial preservation), and B vitamins. It formerly contained the artificial preservative BHT; this was removed in late 2021.

== Advertising ==
When the cereal was first introduced in the 1960s, the original slogan was &quot;The most useful protein ever in a ready-to-eat cereal&quot;. The original mascots (in commercials narrated by Paul Frees) were munchkin-like characters.

Life was popularized during the 1970s by an advertising campaign featuring &quot;Little Mikey&quot;, a hard-to-please four-year-old boy portrayed by John Gilchrist. The commercials featured the slogan &quot;He likes it! Hey, Mikey!&quot; said in surprise after his brothers see Mikey enjoying the cereal.

The ad campaign was created by ad firm Doyle Dane and Bernbach. The campaign ran from 1972 to 1986, becoming one of the longest-running television advertisements in history. A subsequent commercial repeated the scenario with the same dialog but used lumberjacks instead of children. 

== Varieties ==

In 1978, Cinnamon Life, developed by Ed Heaton, was introduced by the Quaker Oats Company and was followed shortly thereafter by Raisin Life. Today, Cinnamon Life accounts for one-third of total Life sales. The Raisin Life variant sold poorly and was discontinued in the mid-1980s.

In 2002, a version of the cereal called Baked Apple Life was released. Honey Graham Life was introduced in early 2004, Life Vanilla Yogurt Crunch in late 2005, and Life Chocolate Oat Crunch, in 2006. All three were discontinued by 2008.

In 2008, Quaker introduced Maple &amp; Brown Sugar Life. In the fall of 2016, Vanilla Life cereal was released. As of March 2023, there are four varieties of Life cereal: Cinnamon, Vanilla, Chocolate, and Original.

Original Life has had its recipe changed several times since its introduction.

<doc id="1247455" wikidata="Q942604" url="?curid=1247455" title="Mexican jay">
<text>The Mexican jay (Aphelocoma wollweberi) formerly known as the gray-breasted jay, is a New World jay native to the Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre Occidental, and Central Plateau of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. In May 2011, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union voted to split the Mexican jay into two species, one retaining the common name Mexican jay and one called the Transvolcanic jay. The Mexican jay is a medium-sized jay with blue upper parts and pale gray underparts. It resembles the Woodhouse&#x27;s scrub-jay, but has an unstreaked throat and breast. It feeds largely on acorns and pine nuts, but includes many other plant and animal foods in its diet. It has a cooperative breeding system where the parents are assisted by other birds to raise their young. This is a common species with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==
A recent decision by the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union Check-list Committee elevated some populations of the Mexican jay to a separate species, called the Transvolcanic jay (&quot;A. ultramarina&quot;), based on diagnosable phenotypic differences in plumage and morphology, millions of years of genetic divergence and no evidence for interbreeding with Mexican jays. The Transvolcanic jay inhabits montane forest in the Transvolcanic Belt of central Mexico. Populations to the north retained the common name Mexican jay, but the Latin name changed to &quot;A. wollweberi&quot;. This was because the type specimen was a Transvolcanic jay, meaning that this species had precedent for the original Latin name &quot;A. ultramarina&quot;.

Thus, as of this decision, there are now five described subspecies of the Mexican jay that are divided into three divergent groups (see below). Marked differences in size, color, vocalizations, and genetics have led some authors to consider at least two of these groups as separate species (Eastern and Western; Navarro-Sigüenza and Peterson 2004). The three groups inhabit three distinct mountainous regions in northern and central Mexico. Genetic breaks in mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA occur abruptly between the groups, indicating some barriers to genetic exchange (McCormack et al. 2008). Size variation among the groups does not always follow Bergmann&#x27;s rule, with more southerly populations in the Sierra Madre Oriental being larger than populations to the north. Mexican jays do not seem to follow Gloger&#x27;s rule either, as populations in arid habitat in southwestern Texas are very blue. On the other hand, Mexican jays in Arizona - also arid habitat - have a washed-out appearance, in accordance with Gloger&#x27;s rule.

Western group
Sierra Madre Occidental in northern [Jalisco] north to central Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. Southern and eastern limits in Jalisco deserve further study. Juveniles have a pink/pale base to the otherwise black bill for up to two years. Eggs are pale green-blue and unspeckled, unlike Eastern group where speckled eggs are common.

*&quot;Aphelocoma wollweberi gracilis&quot;

:Eastern Nayarit and northern Jalisco
:Smallest of the Western subspecies with a distinct, high-pitched vocalization.

*&quot;Aphelocoma wollweberi wollweberi&quot;

:Durango and Zacatecas
:Intermediate in size.

*&quot;Aphelocoma wollweberi arizonae&quot;

:Sonora and Chihuahua north to Arizona and New Mexico, United States
:Largest and palest of all the subspecies.

Eastern group
Sierra Madre Oriental in Nuevo León and western Tamaulipas north to Texas (Chisos Mountains). Juveniles have an all-black exterior to the bill after fledging, but roof of inner upper mandible can remain partially white for up to two years. Reports of less social behavior compared to other groups are over-stated and credible accounts of cooperative breeding (Ligon and Husar 1974) and large flock sizes (Bhagabati and Horvath 2006) exist. Plain, speckled, and even white eggs have been observed in a single study area (McCormack and Berg 2010).

*&quot;Aphelocoma wollweberi couchii&quot;

:Smaller than preceding. Population of the latter subspecies distinguishable by more contrasting markings and ecological preferences (lowland birds). Egg color may range from plain blue to Nile blue with pale brownish speckling, most heavy on blunt half. Gives rattle call similar to &quot;Cyanocitta&quot; and other &quot;Aphelocoma&quot; jays.

Central Plateau group
Central Plateau in Queretaro, Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi, and eastern Jalisco. Similar to Eastern group but larger in most features. Distinguishable in morphology and plumage in ~80% of specimens. There is an area of apparent hybridization in San Luis Potosi that deserves study. 

*&quot;Aphelocoma wollweberi potosina&quot;

==Description==
The Mexican jay is a medium-large (~120 g) passerine similar in size to most other jays, with a blue head, blue-gray mantle, blue wings and tail, and pale gray breast and underparts. The sexes are morphologically similar, and juveniles differ only in having less blue coloration and, in some populations, a pink/pale (instead of black) bill that progressively becomes more black with age (Brown and Horvath 1989). Some field guides misreport this color as yellow because the pale bill becomes yellow in museum study skins. The iris is brown and legs are black. It is most readily distinguished from the similar Woodhouse&#x27;s scrub-jay by the plain (unstreaked) throat and breast, and the mantle contrasting less with the head and wings. Its range somewhat overlaps with the Woodhouse&#x27;s scrub-jay, but, where they co-occur, the two species seem to show ecological and morphological character displacement (Curry &quot;et al.&quot; 2002).

==Distribution and habitat==
It is native to the Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre Occidental, and Central Plateau of Mexico as well as eastern Arizona, western New Mexico and western Texas in the United States. Its preferred habitat is montane pine-oak forest.

==Ecology==
In the winter, the Mexican jay&#x27;s diet consists mainly of acorns and pine nuts, which are stored in the autumn. However, they are omnivorous in all seasons and their diet includes a wide variety of plant and animal matter, including invertebrates, small amphibians and reptiles, and birds&#x27; eggs and nestlings (McCormack and Brown 2008).

It has a cooperative breeding system similar to that of the related Florida scrub-jay, with several birds helping at a nest; these &quot;helpers&quot; are usually immature offspring of the dominant pair from the previous 1–2 years, but also include apparently unrelated flock members.

<text>STIKFAS are 3.25-inch (8cm) model assembly figures or toys made by Stikfas Pte. Ltd., a company based in Singapore. Once assembled, they can be customized with stickers (packaged as Stickers) and parts from other sets. STIKFAS are designed so that all of the joints are moveable ball/sockets, making the figurines poseable and interchangeable.

STIKFAS are sold in kits that include accessories such as Stickers, and sometimes additional models such as a dragon, dog, or bicycle, keeping with the theme of the kit. Stikfas also have small square notches on their bodies, allowing rare earth magnets to be inserted. These notches are found on the upper legs, feet, and body sections. The curved U-shaped hands are also the same diameter as the notches. Once inserted into any of these areas, the magnets allow STIKFAS to be posed while adhering to a magnetic surface, preventing them from falling over. STIKFAS have been used by the webcomic and stop motion animation community.
==Stikfas Company History==
STIKFAS debuted in 2001 through a co-branding collaboration with the computer game publisher Electronic Arts. This collaboration provided proof of concept and STIKFAS Pte. Ltd. was incorporated in August. Work began on the first mass-production model of the STIKFAS Action Figure Kit, which was made available to the public in December 2001, through online sales at www.stikfas.com.

From 2002 to 2004, STIKFAS was licensed to Hasbro Inc. This move saw an increase in its product range, distribution network, and market recognition. During this period, STIKFAS was awarded the title of &quot;Best Original Concept&quot; in &quot;Best of the Best 2002&quot; by Wizard&#x27;s Toyfare magazine, the industry&#x27;s leading publication. That year, STIKFAS came in second for &quot;Most Fun and Innovative Toy&quot; in Toyshop Magazine&#x27;s consumer poll.

STIKFAS debuted in Japan in the fall of 2003 under the distribution of Tomy Direct Co., Ltd. In February 2005, the first comprehensive fan book about STIKFAS, its products, and the people in the company was published by Hobby Japan, the nation&#x27;s leading hobby magazine since 1969. This publication reinforced the cult status that STIKFAS has in Japan.

<text>Virgil Oliver Stamps (1892–1940) was a shape note promoter, singer, composer, and singing school teacher.

V. O. Stamps was born in and raised in the Stamps Community in Upshur County, Texas, and was a key individual in early gospel music publishing. As a youth, he worked with his father in a sawmill, and used his earnings to purchase every gospel songbook he could find. In 1907 he attended the singing school of Richard M. Morgan. Sometime after that, his father bought a small store and V. O. worked there while teaching singing schools until 1914.

In 1914 he became a field representative for the James D. Vaughan Music Company of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. Stamps worked for the Tennessee Music Company, Samuel Beazley and J. D. Vaughan from 1914–24, including singing in a quartet representing the Vaughan company. Around 1915 he composed his first song, entitled &quot;The Man Behind the Plow&quot;.

In 1924 he founded the V. O. Stamps Music Company in Jacksonville, Texas. In that year the first session of the &quot;V. O. Stamps School of Music&quot; was held, with a faculty that included Thomas Benton, C. C. Stafford, R. B. Vaughan, and Otis Deaton. In 1924 or 1925 he published &quot;Harbor Bells&quot; - his first song book. In 1927, with J. R. Baxter, Stamps formed the Stamps-Baxter Music Company, based in Dallas, Texas. Stamps organized a gospel quartet in which he sang bass. He was a pioneer is the use of radio for promoting Southern gospel music and quartet singing. Radio station KRLD gave the quartet a daily show in 1936, after a large response from their radio performance at the Texas Centennial Exposition.

==Work==
Virgil Stamps wrote the music and melody for the famous gospel song &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot;, in 1937, while Luther G. Presley wrote the lyrics.

Among the songs written by V. O. Stamps are &quot;Love Is the Key,&quot; &quot;Singing on My Way,&quot; and &quot;I Am Going.&quot;
V. O. Stamps was inducted into the Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1997.

<text>A travelers&#x27; information station (TIS), also called highway advisory radio (HAR) by the United States Department of Transportation, is a licensed low-powered non-commercial radio station, used to broadcast information to the general public, including for motorists regarding travel, destinations of interest, and situations of imminent danger and emergencies. They are commonly operated by transportation departments, national and local parks departments and historic sites, airport authorities, local governments, federal agencies, colleges and universities, hospitals and health agencies, and for special events and destinations. 
==United States==
===Current regulations and applications===
In the United States, most Travelers Information Stations (TIS) are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), although stations operated by U.S. national parks and others under U.S. federal government jurisdiction are licensed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Programming normally consists of continuously repeated pre-recorded messages. Permissible station content is defined by the FCC as:
Most TIS/HAR licenses in the U.S are held by governmental entities, in addition to quasi-governmental agencies and authorities as well as health and emergency service providers working in conjunction with the government. Stations may be licensed to operate on any AM band frequency from 530–1700 kHz. (In a single case—WQFG689, licensed to the County of Hudson, New Jersey—a station has been authorized to transmit on 1710 kHz. 1710 kHz is also in use by a number of federally licensed stations.)
A majority of TIS stations operate on 530 kHz, which is reserved exclusively for use by this service, and on the AM expanded band frequencies of 1610–1700 kHz, which is the least congested portion of the AM broadcast band. On 1610 kHz TIS service stations have a co-priority status with broadcasting stations, while on the remaining standard AM broadcasting frequencies, 540 kHz-1600 kHz and 1620–1700 kHz, TIS stations are considered a secondary service, with priority held by standard broadcasting station assignments.

Although initially envisioned as providing general information to motorists and travelers, TIS stations have also been developed for supporting emergency public safety communication, and the FCC currently licenses the stations through its Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB). During a crisis mobile phone networks are often overloaded, and TIS stations can be used to broadcast emergency instructions. Also, during a widespread electrical outage stations equipped with reserve battery or generator power can continue operating, for reception by battery-operated radios. In 2008 the American Association of Information Radio Operators (AAIRO) was formed to represent station operators, and at the time of its formation the group emphasized the ability of TIS stations to broadcast live local updates to affected communities during emergencies.

Two forms of transmitting antennas are employed. Most commonly used are standard non-directional vertical antennas. However, an alternate implementation, called &quot;leaky cable&quot;, is a form of carrier current transmission, which employs long horizontal conductors, commonly run alongside roadways. Stations using a standard antenna are generally limited to a coverage radius of , with an antenna height of no more than , and a maximum power of 10 watts, although special events and critical evacuation systems, such as those in the Florida Keys and near chemical and nuclear facilities, have been granted waivers to exceed that limit, typically for up to 100 watts.
Individual &quot;leaky cable&quot; installations are limited to a length of , although &quot;ribbon systems&quot; consisting of installations sequentially located along a travel route are permitted. Because cable installations are less effective radiators, they are permitted to use up to 50 watts order to achieve a maximum of 2 mV/m at from the cable.

In order to limit potential interference to stations operating on adjacent frequencies, TIS transmitters are required to employ a low-pass filter to reduce the transmission of audio frequencies higher than 5 kHz.

===TIS service history===
The TIS service was first authorized by the FCC in 1977 following two years of study. At this time the standard AM broadcast band ran from 540 kHz to 1600 kHz, and the new TIS service was initially assigned exclusive use of the two adjoining frequencies of 530 kHz and 1610 kHz. However, on June 8, 1988 an International Telecommunication Union conference held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil adopted provisions, effective July 1, 1990, to extend the upper end of the AM broadcast band in the Americas, by adding ten frequencies which spanned from 1610 kHz to 1700 kHz.
By this time 1610 kHz had been assigned for use by hundreds of Travelers Information Stations in the United States. Moreover, the licensing authority was shared between the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), so coordination between these two agencies was required. It was concluded that, for operation on 1610 kHz, TIS and broadcasting stations were considered &quot;co-primary&quot; services, thus existing TIS stations were protected from having to move to new frequencies. (This has effectively made it impossible to assign any standard broadcasting stations to 1610 kHz in the United States.) It was also informally suggested that, once most radios could tune to the higher frequencies, all of the TIS stations on 1610 kHz could be moved as a group to 1710 kHz, however this was never implemented.

On July 18, 2013, in response to petitions submitted from Highway Information Systems, Inc. (HIS), the American Association of Information Radio Operators (AAIRO), and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the FCC adopted Report and Order 13-98 updating and clarifying the regulations applying to TIS stations. The Report and Order, as summarized by a May 2014 Compliance Guide (DA-14-651), approved the establishment of &quot;ribbons&quot; of sequentially located roadside transmitters so long as content remained pertinent at all points. This also clarified that programming content must relate to travel, emergencies or situations of imminent danger to the public, and that it is at the discretion of station operators, based on their knowledge of the area and its population, of what situations present an imminent danger.

A subsequent Rule Making procedure, instituted at the request of the AAIRO, resulted in the loosening of the audio frequency limit from 3 kHz to 5 kHz, after it was determined that the improved frequency response would increase intelligibility without increasing interference to stations operating on adjacent frequencies. Although the original proposal suggested completely eliminating the filtering, the 5 kHz standard was adopted as a compromise after the National Association of Broadcasters noted that &quot;full-power AM radio stations routinely use 5 kHz filters to address and prevent interference among AM stations, with few significant problems&quot;.

===Low-power FM stations===
In 2000 the FCC began authorizing non-commercial Low Power FM (LPFM) stations, which are not formally a part of the TIS/HAR service, although in a few cases stations have been adapted to serve a similar function. LPFM stations operate with up to 100 watts and generally have somewhat larger service areas than TIS stations on the AM band, and also avoid the increased nighttime interference from distant stations which affects AM band stations. However, in contrast to the TIS service, there are only limited &quot;filing window&quot; periods to apply for permission to build an LPFM station, and these stations are required to produce up to 8 hours of new programming each day, and also in certain instances to share airtime with other licensees.

LPFM examples include WTUS-LP in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, originally operated by the Tuscaloosa Tourism and Sports Commission before being transferred in 2016 to the Tuscaloosa City Board of Education, and WGEO-LP in Georgetown, South Carolina, which is operated by the Georgetown City Fire Department. State and local governments may also create state-wide networks to provide non-commercial public safety information via radio using LPFM stations. Colorado has a statewide network of LPFMs used in this manner, while many other state, county, or local governments use one or more stations.

==Europe==

In France information is provided on 107.7 MHz FM along selected autoroutes. In Italy most highways are covered by RAI&#x27;s Isoradio network, broadcasting in most areas on 103.3 MHz. In Germany and the former Yugoslavia, highways and motorways are provided with traffic information by radio, although the original systems have been largely replaced.

Newer RDS-based systems interrupt a station&#x27;s regular programming to give travelers current information about the highway, updated traffic and weather reports, public service announcements by various governmental and public organizations, railway information and news bulletins. These radio systems are most commonly used in Slovenia, Croatia and partly in Serbia. Highways served with traffic radio information include: 
* European route E61: Villach–Kranj–Ljubljana
* European route E70: Ljubljana–Zagreb–Sisak–Slavonski Brod–Belgrade.

==Japan==
In Japan Highway Radio broadcasts on 1620 and 1629 kHz AM along stretches of major expressways.

==Canada==
TIS stations operate in Canada (on both AM and FM bands).

==Brazil==
TIS stations in Brazil are known as &quot;Radiovias&quot; ou &quot;Rádio-estradas&quot;. Currently, Brazil has only a single TIS station in operation, called &quot;CCR FM&quot;. The radio station operates on low-power antennas along Presidente Dutra Highway, between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, on 107.5 MHz, and airs information about traffic and news. Between 2004 and 2018, &quot;Radiovia Freeway FM&quot;, a TIS station operated on 88.3 MHz, was also on the air along the BR-290, between Porto Alegre and the northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul.

The service of TIS stations is not provided for by the Brazilian broadcasting law, however, Folha de S. Paulo has reported in July 2019 that the Brazilian Ministry of Communications wants to include in its agenda the regularization of TIS stations. In May 2021, the Brazilian government launched the project to implement TIS stations on the country&#x27;s federal highways, authorizing concessionaires to operate radio stations with coverage on the roads. These stations were exempt from the &quot;A Voz do Brazil&quot; airing requirements.

==Australia==
In some areas of Australia stations operate on 87.6–88 MHz FM.

==Nigeria==
TIS stations operate in some areas of Nigeria.

<text>A portable audio player is a personal mobile device that allows the user to listen to recorded audio while mobile. Sometimes a distinction is made between a &quot;portable&quot; player, battery-powered and with one or more small loudspeakers, and a &quot;personal&quot; player, listened to with earphones.

==History==
Portable battery-operated reel-to-reel tape recorders were introduced in the 1950s, initially tending to be high-priced units for reporters, produced by Uher and Nagra. Lower-priced units became available later. In the mid-1960s Philips introduced the battery-operated compact cassette recorder, originally used for recording speech. At about the same time the 8-track player was introduced. It was very successful at the time, though bulky and inconvenient to use. There was a pause at the end of each track as the program changed. 
The compact cassette, although physically much smaller than the 8-track cartridge, became capable of good sound quality as the technology developed, and longer cassette tapes became available. Cassette decks (not portable) were introduced for home use, and this encouraged the production of pre-recorded music cassettes.

==Personal stereo==

The first portable audio player available to the general public, the Sony Walkman, was introduced in 1979 and sold very well. It was much smaller than an 8-track player or the earlier cassette recorders, and was listened to with stereophonic headphones, unlike previous equipment which used small loudspeakers. Unlike small loudspeakers, headphones were capable of very good sound quality. All previous compact cassette devices could record as well as play back; Walkmans and similar devices often had no recording facility, but took advantage of the pre-recorded cassettes that had become widely available.

==Disk players==

Early personal CD players can play commercial CDs; later models can play recordable CD-R and CDRW media either copied from a pressed CD or containing MP3 and similar files.

==Media players== 
In 1998, digital audio players (DAPs) based on flash memory or hard disk storage became available (The Rio PMP300 from Diamond Multimedia is widely considered to be the first mass market DAP). Files are usually compressed using lossy compression; this reduces file size at the cost of some loss of quality. The trade-off between degree of compression and file size can be varied, although this is not an option for existing compressed files. The advantage of solid-state DAPs over hard disks and CDs is resistance to vibration, small size and weight, and low battery usage. Early solid-state DAPs had capacities of a few tens of kilobytes; capacities of many gigabytes are available.

<text>Gilbert A. Santos (April 19, 1938 – April 19, 2018) was an American radio play-by-play announcer based in the Boston area. He called games for the New England Patriots of the National Football League and the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association, served as the morning sports reporter for WBZ radio in Boston. He was an inductee of the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame.

He retired from WBZ radio in January 2009, and was inducted into the WBZ Radio Hall of Fame on July 9, 2009. The Patriots 2012 season was his final season of radio play-by-play.

==Early years==
Santos was born in Acushnet, Massachusetts, and grew up in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. He graduated from Fairhaven High School in 1956. He attended the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and later graduated from the New England Broadcast School. From 1959 through 1971, Santos worked on radio at WBSM and WNBH in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and WSAR and WALE in Fall River, Massachusetts.

==Career==
Santos first began his work on Patriots games as the color commentator working with play-by-play announcer Bob Starr from 1966 through 1970 on WBZ 1030. After Starr&#x27;s departure from the Boston market following the 1970 NFL season, Santos took over as play-by-play announcer and handled that assignment for nine years. From 1980 through 1990, the Patriots&#x27; broadcast rights shifted—first to WEEI 590, then to WHDH 850—and Santos spent 11 seasons out of the team&#x27;s radio booth, with John Carlson, Curt Gowdy and Dale Arnold serving as play-by-play announcers for those flagship stations. Santos returned as the Patriots&#x27; radio voice in 1991 when WBZ radio regained the team&#x27;s broadcast rights.

From 1972 through 1978 and from 1990 through 2011, his partner in the booth was former Patriots kicker Gino Cappelletti, except for the opening eight games of the 2001 Patriots season when Cappelletti was hospitalized with an illness and former Patriots player Peter Brock substituted for Cappelletti. Cappelletti retired from his position prior to the 2012 season and was replaced by former Patriots quarterback Scott Zolak.

In addition to his work at WBZ, Santos commentated games for the Boston Celtics, Boston Breakers, Providence Friars basketball, Penn State Nittany Lions football, and Boston College Eagles football. On January 10, 2009, Santos announced his retirement from WBZ radio, effective at the end of that month. He continued as Patriots play-by-play announcer when the team&#x27;s network switched from WBCN to the new WBZ-FM, branded as &quot;The Sports Hub&quot;.

In April 2012, Santos suffered a bout with pneumonia and was briefly hospitalized, calling into question his future as Patriots play-by-play announcer. He nonetheless announced he would return for one final season as Patriots broadcaster, retiring after the 2012 NFL season. In April 2013, Bob Socci was announced as Santos&#x27; replacement.

Santos&#x27; 36 years of service made him the longest-serving announcer in the NFL, tied with Merrill Reese of the Philadelphia Eagles; he was also the final announcer who remained from the American Football League era.

===Milestones===
On September 26, 2010, the Patriots defeated the Buffalo Bills 38–30; it marked the 700th Patriots game, encompassing preseason, regular season, playoffs, and the Super Bowl, that Santos broadcast. His 750th broadcast took place on November 11, 2012, a dramatic 37–31 Patriots win, also against the Bills. He commentated 15 of the club&#x27;s 19 playoff runs and six Super Bowls.

On December 30, 2012, Santos was rejoined by Gino Cappelletti for the first quarter of New England&#x27;s 28–0 shutout of the Dolphins, his final regular season broadcast. CBS Sports also simulcast part of Santos&#x27; play-by-play during the game&#x27;s first quarter. Prior to the game, during a ceremony honoring the contributions of Santos and Cappelletti, Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft announced that Santos would be inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2013.

The last game Santos commentated was in January 2013, the Patriots&#x27; AFC Championship Game loss to the Ravens, his 759th broadcast. Santos was inducted to the Patriots Hall of Fame on July 22, 2013, alongside fellow honoree Tedy Bruschi.

==Personal life==
Santos served in the Massachusetts Army National Guard with the 1st Howitzer Battalion, 211 Field Artillery, and attained the rank of staff sergeant. He and his wife, Roberta, were married in 1961 and had two children. They lived in Raynham, Massachusetts.

Santos died on April 19, 2018, his 80th birthday and 57th wedding anniversary. A public visitation was held on April 24 in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. His funeral was held on April 25 in Raynham, where he was buried with military honors.

<text>Dominic James Miller (born 21 March 1960) is a British guitarist. He has worked most of his career as a sideman and guitarist for, among others, Julia Fordham, Eddi Reader and notably Sting. He has also released several solo albums.

==Career==
Miller was born in Hurlingham, Argentina, to an Irish mother and an American father who worked for Johnson Wax. When he was ten, his family moved to Racine, Wisconsin, where the Johnson headquarters was located, and moved to London two years later. Returning to Racine, at fifteen, he performed publicly for the first time at a club in Racine as the only white person in a soul music band. He moved to London and studied at Guildhall School of Music, then returned to the U.S. and took a summer course at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. He also took lessons from Brazilian guitarist Sebastião Tapajós.

In the 1980s, Miller toured as a guitarist for World Party and King Swamp. As a session musician he recorded with the Pretenders, Phil Collins, Paul Young, and Level 42. Since 1990, he has recorded and toured with Sting. He co-wrote the hit song &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot; with Sting. He released his debut solo album, &quot;First Touch&quot;, in 1995, followed by &quot;Second Nature&quot; and &quot;Third World&quot;.

In 2003 he released the classical album &quot;Shapes&quot;, with interpretations of Bach, Beethoven, Edward Elgar, and Tomaso Albinoni.

His son Rufus (b. June 1985 in Hammersmith) is also a guitarist performs with him. His daughter Misty Miller is a singer-song writer who has released the album &quot;The Whole Family Is Worried&quot;. 

Currently, Miller lives in the south of France.

<doc id="1247521" wikidata="Q889628" url="?curid=1247521" title="John Farmer Jr.">
<text>John J. Farmer Jr. (born June 24, 1957) is an American author, lawyer, politician, and jurist. He was the director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics, where he also led the Miller Center for Community Protection and Resilience (CPR). He served as acting governor of New Jersey for 90 minutes on January 8, 2002, by virtue of his status as New Jersey Attorney General.

==Early life and education==
Farmer was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1957. He attended Georgetown University, where he received a B.A. degree in 1979 and a J.D. degree in 1986.

==Career==
After law school, he worked as a clerk for New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Alan B. Handler. From 1988 to 1990, he was an associate in the law firm of Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland &amp; Perretti in Morristown. From 1990 to 1994, he was an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.

===Whitman administration===
In 1997, Governor Christine Todd Whitman appointed Farmer as chief counsel, after having served as deputy chief counsel and assistant counsel to the governor.

Farmer was nominated to be New Jersey Attorney General on March 15, 1999, and was sworn in the following June after being confirmed unanimously by the New Jersey Senate. He continued to serve under Donald DiFrancesco after Whitman&#x27;s resignation.

===Acting governor===
Farmer served as Acting Governor for 90 minutes on January 8, 2002. Following Governor Christine Todd Whitman&#x27;s resignation the previous year to become head of the EPA, Farmer was one of four people to serve as acting governor for the one-year period between Whitman&#x27;s resignation and Jim McGreevey&#x27;s inauguration, along with three different senate presidents, Donald DiFrancesco, John O. Bennett, and Richard Codey. DiFrancesco served as acting governor for all but the last week of this period, when his term as senate president ended with the mandate of the outgoing senate on January 8, 2002, while newly elected governor Jim McGreevey would not be inaugurated before January 15, 2002.

The state did not have the position of lieutenant governor until 2010, and succession rules specified that the next in line for governor after the Senate President and the Speaker of the Assembly, which both became vacant on January 8, would be the Attorney General until the next Senate President could be sworn in or until an Acting Senate President could be elected. This automatically made Farmer Acting Governor. Farmer served as Acting Governor for 90 minutes until Republican Senator John O. Bennett and Democratic Senator Richard Codey were duly elected and sworn in as co-presidents of the senate, as the Senate had been evenly split between the two parties. They agreed to evenly divide the remaining week in the gubernatorial term, with Bennett serving from January 8, 2002 to January 12, 2002; and Codey serving from January 12, 2002, to January 15, 2002.

As a result, the state had five different people serving as governor during a period of eight days: DiFrancesco, Farmer, Bennett, Codey, and McGreevey. In 2018, political journalist David Wildstein speculated that, as Robert E. Littell served as acting president of the senate until Bennett and Codey assumed the role, it&#x27;s possible that &quot;maybe&quot; Littell assumed the governorship for &quot;a few minutes&quot; as well. However, Littell is not included on a list of governors of the state published by the National Governors Association.

===9/11 Commission senior counsel===
Farmer subsequently acted as senior counsel to the 9/11 Commission, chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean.

Farmer&#x27;s book, &quot;The Ground Truth: The Untold Story of America Under Attack On 9/11&quot;, was released days before the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. In &quot;The Ground Truth,&quot; Farmer made the following controversial statement: &quot;At some level of government,&quot; says Dean Farmer, &quot;at some point in time, a decision was made not to tell the truth about the national response to the attacks on the morning of 9/11. We owe the truth to the families of the victims of 9/11. We owe it to the American public as well, because only by understanding what has gone wrong in the past can we assure our nation&#x27;s safety in the future.&quot;

On January 21, 2010, he appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;.

In July 2011, he was appointed the 13th (and tie-breaking) member of New Jersey&#x27;s Congressional Redistricting Commission by both its Democratic and Republican members. New Jersey lost one Congressional seat in redistricting and the panel redrew the congressional districts, determining which seat was lost.

===Rutgers University===
Farmer has served as dean of Rutgers School of Law–Newark. In his tenure, In conjunction with &quot;Rutgers Law Review&quot;, Farmer planned a multi-day symposium to address the many legal uncertainties in national security policies and practices following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The symposium featured Thomas Kean, Michael Chertoff, John Joseph Gibbons, and others. Two United States Supreme Court justices, Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito, also have spoken at the law school. Prior to his deanship, Farmer practiced law as a partner in a North Jersey firm he founded, and was an adjunct professor of law at the Rutgers School of Law–Newark. He also regularly contributes to &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and other publications.

On April 11, 2013, he was appointed as the senior vice president and general counsel at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.

On August 19, 2019, Farmer was appointed by Chancellor Christopher J. Molloy to succeed Ruth B. Mandel as the director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.

<text>Rush&#x27;n Attack, also known as in Japan and Europe, is a run-and-gun and hack-and-slash video game developed and released by Konami for arcades in 1985, and later converted to the Nintendo Entertainment System and home computers. Its North American title is a play on the phrase &quot;Russian attack&quot; due to its Cold War setting. It was ported to home systems and became a critical and commercial success for arcades and home computers.

==Gameplay==
The players assume the roles of the United States special operations Green Berets (named Steve and Ben on the Japanese Famicom ad poster) who are infiltrating an enemy military base to save POWs from execution by firing squad. There are four stages, each ending with a special group of ambushers:
#Marshalling Area, ends with a truckload of jump-kicking enemies
#Harbor, ends with a pack of German Shepherds
#Air Base, ends with three autogyros
#Siberian Camp, ends with three flame thrower operators
The Soviet Armed Forces that attack throughout every stage are Soldiers, Gunners, Supply Runners, Combat Specialists, Jetpack Soldiers, German Shepherds, Parachute Gunners, Gyrocopters, and Flame Throwers.

The omnipresent combat knife can be supplemented with captured arms. By eliminating certain Russian militants, the players can obtain a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades. When the mission is accomplished, the four rescued POWs salute and the player repeats the game from the first stage on the next difficulty level. An invisible time limit kills the player.

Extra lives are given at 30,000 and 70,000, and per 70,000 up to 980,000, and survival of the fittest mode thereafter.

==Ports==

In 1986, Ocean Software released home versions as &quot;Green Beret&quot; on their Imagine label for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore Plus/4, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, Atari 8-bit computers, MSX, and BBC Micro.

The Commodore 64 port was programmed by David Collier, with graphics by Steve Wahid and music by Martin Galway. The Spectrum version was programmed by Jonathan Smith.

It was released in North America in December 1986 and an unrelated IBM PC version was released by Konami for the North American market with the &quot;Rush&#x27;n Attack&quot; name in 1989.

===Famicom Disk System and NES===
A Family Computer Disk System version of &quot;Green Beret&quot; was released in Japan on April 10, 1987, along with a corresponding version for the Nintendo Entertainment System (as &quot;Rush&#x27;n Attack&quot;) released that month in North America, and 1989 in Europe.

The objective in the NES version was changed from rescuing prisoners to destroying a secret weapon being developed in the enemy&#x27;s headquarters. A two-player simultaneous cooperative mode was introduced. The gameplay mechanics are essentially identical to the arcade version, but the Flamethrower is removed (only the Rocket Launcher and Grenades remain) and two new power-up items are introduced: a Star mark which grants invincibility and a pistol with unlimited ammo, both which are only usable for a limited period. The NES version features two additional stages that are not in the arcade game: an airport set between the Missile Base and the Harbor, where the player faces a group of rocket soldiers at the end; and a new final stage set inside the enemy&#x27;s base that ends with the player using rocket launchers dropped by enemy soldiers to disarm a nuclear missile. The flamethrower corps at the end of the Warehouse stage was replaced by a paratrooper unit. The Famicom version has a few cosmetic differences with higher difficulty compared to its NES counterpart, along with underground areas in three of the levels, which are accessed via destroying specific mines that reveal ladders to the floors below.

===Game Boy Advance===
A conversion of the arcade version of &quot;Rush&#x27;n Attack&quot; is included in the 2002 compilation &quot;Konami Collector&#x27;s Series: Arcade Advanced&quot; for the Game Boy Advance. The game features the same four stages as in the arcade version, and two extra stages unlocked via the Konami Code. A two-player versus mode has been added, which utilizes the Game Link Cable. The A button jumps instead of the D-pad.

===Nintendo DS===
A second portable version is included in the 2007 compilation &quot;Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits&quot; for the Nintendo DS. Unlike the GBA version, the DS version is a direct port of the original arcade game, but includes various bonus features such as scans of the instruction cards and leaflet, as well as tips.

===Xbox 360===
&quot;Rush&#x27;n Attack&quot; was released on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 in May 2007. This version is another direct port of the arcade game, but features an optional game mode with improved graphics and a remixed soundtrack. It was developed by Digital Eclipse.

===Konami Net DX===
&quot;Green Beret&quot; was released for smartphones in Japan in 2006. The mobile version is a direct port of the Famicom version with a new health bar. The mobile port was re-released in China for Java phones in December 2008.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Green Beret&quot; in its November 15, 1985, issue as the third-most successful table arcade unit of the month. In Europe, &quot;Green Beret&quot; was considered one &quot;of the first military shoot &#x27;em ups&quot; on the market and became a major hit in arcades. The home computer conversions topped the UK Gallup sales charts in June 1986, becoming one of the top four best-selling games of 1986 in the UK, and one of the year&#x27;s top three best-selling Commodore 64 games. Its budget re-release later topped the UK budget sales chart in July 1989.

&quot;Green Beret&quot; was well-received by critics. Mike Roberts and Eric Doyle of &quot;Computer Gamer&quot; magazine gave the arcade game a positive review, comparing it favorably with the action film &quot;&quot; (1985) while calling it an &quot;incredibly violent game&quot; that is &quot;brilliant to play&quot;. &quot;Commodore User&quot; said the arcade version is &quot;a kind of rightwards scrolling &quot;Commando&quot; [but] much better&quot; while praising &quot;brilliant&quot; graphics and sound.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions, calling the game &quot;Konami&#x27;s answer&quot; to Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Commando&quot; (1985) and comparing it favorably with the &quot;Rambo&quot; film series. The review said it is fast, &quot;furious&quot; and &quot;terribly addictive&quot;.

The MS-DOS version of &quot;Rush&#x27;n Attack&quot; was reviewed in 1989 in &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine by Patricia Hartley and Kirk Lesser, giving 3 out of 5 stars. &quot;ACE&quot; reviewed the budget re-release of &quot;Green Beret&quot; for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC in 1989, calling it an &quot;intelligently thought out shoot &#x27;em up with excellent graphics&quot;. The NES version ranked 99 on IGN&#x27;s top 100 NES games list.

<text>William Omar Landrón Rivera (born February 10, 1978), known professionally as Don Omar, is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and actor. He is also known as the &quot;King of Reggaeton&quot; by music critics and fans alike. The artist was recognized by &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one reggaeton legend. He is often cited as an influence by other Hispanic urban performers.

Landrón was born in Santurce, a neighborhood of San Juan, Puerto Rico. He is one of the artists credited with presenting reggaeton to audiences around the world and having turned the musical genre into a global phenomenon. He jumped to stardom with the release of his first studio album, &quot;The Last Don&quot;, released in 2003. The album sold 411,000 units in the US and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Since then, he has sold around 15 million records, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists. On September 1, 2017, after a long musical career he announced that he would retire after a series of concerts at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum in Puerto Rico, scheduled to be held on December 15, 16 and 17. However, he returned to music on April 20, 2019 with his song single &quot;Ramayama&quot; featuring Farruko.

During his career, Don Omar earned numerous accolades, including three Latin Grammy Awards, one &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, 17 &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards, three Lo Nuestro Awards, eight Viña del Mar International Song Festival Awards, among others.

Don Omar has also portrayed Rico Santos in four films in the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise. He first played the character in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; and then returned for &quot;Fast Five&quot; (2011), &quot;The Fate of the Furious&quot; (2017) and &quot;F9&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Don Omar was born in Santurce, a neighborhood of San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he was raised, the oldest son of William Landrón and Luz Antonia Rivera. From an early age, he showed interest in the music of Vico C and Brewley MC. During his youth, he became an active member of a Protestant church, Iglesia Evangélica Restauración en Cristo in Bayamón where he occasionally offered sermons. However, after four years, he left the church to dedicate himself to singing.

==Career==
His first public performance in a night club was accompanied by disc jockey Eliel Lind Osorio. Afterwards, he appeared regularly on compilation albums from popular DJs and producers including Luny Tunes, Noriega, and DJ Eric. He also worked as a backup singer for the duo Héctor &amp; Tito. One of the members, Héctor el Father, helped him produce his first solo album.

Omar&#x27;s career rose to stardom with the release of his first studio album, &quot;The Last Don&quot; with Frankie Needles. Both the studio version and its live edition have been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Worldwide, &quot;The Last Don: Live [CD &amp; DVD]&quot; has sold over one million copies, according to his official website. He earned awards for Latin Pop Album of the Year and New Artist &amp; Latin Rap/Hip-Hop Album of the Year by the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Awards in 2003. &quot;The Last Don: Live [CD &amp; DVD]&quot; was also nominated for Urban Music Album at the 2005 Latin Grammy Awards.

In 2005, Don Omar featured on rapper Cuban Link&#x27;s hit single &quot;Scandalous&quot; which peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart. The song was released as the second single to Cuban&#x27;s second and official debut album Chain Reaction.

Omar&#x27;s May 2006 album &quot;King of Kings&quot;, became history&#x27;s highest ranking reggaeton LP in the top 10 US charts, with its debut at #1 on the Latin sales charts and the #1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Rhythm Radio Chart with his single &quot;Angelito&quot;. Omar was also able to beat the in-store appearance sales record at Disney World&#x27;s Virgin Megastore previously set by pop star Britney Spears.
With the highest charting debut by a reggaeton artist, Omar&#x27;s &quot;King of Kings&quot; entered at No. 7 with 74,000 beating. In April 2007, Don Omar received the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Award for Reggaeton Album of the Year for &quot;King of Kings&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; recognized that &quot;King of Kings&quot; was the most successful album of the decade in Latin America, besides being the most successful in the history of the genre of reggaeton. &quot;Billboard&quot; estimated that the album sold over 4.1 million copies by the end of 2009.

Omar participated in Gilberto Santa Rosa&#x27;s presentation in an event titled &quot;Concierto del Amor&quot;, presented in the Madison Square Garden on February 9, 2008. He closed the event and performed reggaeton themes with Frankie Needles.

Omar&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;iDon&quot;, was released on April 28, 2009. This album is of Sold over 2.5 million. &quot;Virtual Diva&quot; became the most requested song on Latin radio stations. The second official single, titled &quot;Sexy Robótica&quot;, was released on July 6, 2009.

The album &quot;Don Omar Presents: Meet the Orphans&quot; was released on November 16, 2010. The album features the artists under Don Omar&#x27;s Orfanato Music Group label and other reggaeton artists. The album includes the promotional single &quot;Hasta Abajo&quot; and the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Danza Kuduro&quot; featuring Portuguese-French singer Lucenzo, as well as collaborations from Orfanato Music Group artists including Kendo Kaponi, Syko, Plan B, Zion &amp; Lennox, Yaga &amp; Mackie and Danny Fornaris. &quot;Danza Kuduro&quot; appears on the &quot;Fast Five&quot; soundtrack and is the song played at the conclusion of the movie. He is signed to VI Music and Machete Music through Universal Music Latino. The album sold over 3 million.

The album &quot;Don Omar Presents MTO²: New Generation&quot; was released on May 1, 2012. The album features newly signed to Orfanato Music Group Natti Natasha as well as many other signed artists and other reggaeton artists like Zion &amp; Lennox. The album includes the singles &quot;&quot;, which won the award for Best Urban Song at the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards, and &quot;Dutty Love&quot; featuring Natti Natasha, which was also nominated. The album also features collaborations with Juan Magán, Mims, Syko, Vinny el Vendito, and Yunel Cruz. The album has been well received as it won the award for Best Urban Music Album at the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards.

After a decade-long rivalry feud with fellow artist Daddy Yankee for the &quot;King of Reggaeton&quot; title, in early 2016 Daddy Yankee and Don Omar announced in a &quot;Billboard&quot; press conference that they would perform together on stage in a concert series called &quot;The Kingdom Tour&quot;. The tour announcement left many fans in disbelief, while selling out in minutes in cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, Los Angeles, New York. Discussing the tour and his rivalry with Daddy Yankee, Don Omar said &quot;Let me clarify: I am not his best friend, and he is not my best friend, but we respect each other. That desire to be the best is what has pushed us to be better.&quot;

In September 2021, Omar signed a multi-year partnership with Saban Music Group. In February 2022, Omar was announced as a headliner of the 2022 Los Della Festival in San Bernardino, California.

==Personal life==
In 2003, Omar had his first son, Nicolás Valle Gómez. Omar married forecaster/journalist Jackie Guerrido on April 19, 2008. In March 2011, it was revealed they had divorced.

On June 17, 2024, Omar posted on his Instagram a picture of his arm with an Orlando Health wristband on, stating in the caption that he has cancer. He ended off the caption with the words &quot;See you soon,&quot; then the hashtag &quot;#fuckcancer.&quot; 

Just a day after the post regarding his cancer diagnosis, Omar announced he was cancer free. &quot;Today I woke up cancer free and grateful,&quot; said Omar.

==Legal issues==
On September 18, 2007, Omar was briefly detained in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia due to a legal dispute. A Bolivian concert promoter sued him and some of his management after he canceled a concert scheduled for earlier that year in La Paz as part of the international tour Up Close. The organization claimed that he had defrauded US$70,000 due to the cancellation. Omar responded that he canceled the concert because the company did not provide air tickets in time. After the case was presented before a local judge, both parties reached an agreement. Omar was allowed to leave the country in order to comply with a previously scheduled appearance in Buenos Aires on Argentine television and returned the next day to hold his concert in Santa Cruz&#x27;s Tahuichi Aguilera football stadium.

<text>Let&#x27;s Stay Together is the fourth studio album by soul singer Al Green. Released on January 31, 1972, as the follow-up to his moderate success, &quot;Al Green Gets Next to You&quot;, it was recorded at Royal Recording Studio in Memphis, Tennessee. A commercial success, it peaked at number eight on the pop albums chart and became the first of six consecutive Green albums to peak at number one on the soul album chart, where it held the position for ten straight weeks.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; is best-known for its title track, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot;, which became Green&#x27;s signature song and his only number-one pop hit single. The third Green album produced by Willie Mitchell; &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; marked the beginning of Green&#x27;s classic period of critically acclaimed albums.

==Critical reaction==

The album&#x27;s appeal was widespread among critics; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted, &quot;Green&#x27;s voice is something to marvel at. He can croon, shout, scat, rise to the smoothest falsetto, and throw in the funkiest growls ... &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; is, like its predecessor, an indispensable treat.&quot;

In 1999, &quot;Q&quot; magazine wrote that the album &quot;shows him as the authentic voice of love&#x27;s pain and purity on such wonders as &#x27;How Can You Mend A Broken Heart?&#x27;&quot; and that &quot;[H]is cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; [song] took the soul ballad to new levels of artistry and refinement.&quot;

<text>Lieutenant General Raymond Stallings McLain (April 4, 1890 – December 14, 1954) was a senior United States Army officer. From October 1944, through the end of World War II, McLain commanded XIX Corps (United States).

In the words of General George C. Marshall, Raymond S. McLain &quot;gave great distinction to the term &#x27;citizen soldier. His service to his state and nation spanned more than forty years.

==Early life and military career==
Raymond McLain was born in Washington County, Kentucky, as a son of Thomas A. and Lucetta (Stallings) McLain. He graduated from Hill&#x27;s Business College in Oklahoma City in 1909 and subsequently worked as a clerk in real estate office and then worked as an abstractor. Simultaneously, he entered in the Oklahoma Army National Guard in 1912, where he attained the rank of sergeant.

In December 1914, during World War I (although the United States was still neutral at this stage), he was commissioned as an officer, with the rank of second lieutenant in the Oklahoma Army National Guard after he attended the School of Musketry at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He was promoted again next year to the rank of first lieutenant. Following the Pancho Villa Expedition in 1916, he served on the Mexican border.

The American entry into World War I came on April 6, 1917. During the war, Raymond served as a machine gun company commander with the 36th Division on the Western Front with the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) under General John Pershing until 1919. After return home, he continued his service with the Oklahoma Army National Guard and subsequently returned to his career in business.

==Between the wars==
In 1938, while pursuing a career in business, McLain, rose to the rank of brigadier general in the Oklahoma National Guard and attended the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. After graduating he was posted to the 45th Infantry Division, an Oklahoma Army National Guard formation, as an assistant chief of staff.

In September 1940, he was recalled to the active duty and was appointed as the artillery commander of the 45th Infantry Division.

==World War II==
During World War II, he commanded the divisional artillery. He led the artillery overseas during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July – August 1943, where he earned the first of two Distinguished Service Crosses. He continued to lead the artillery in the Allied invasion of Italy in September, and in the early stages of the Italian campaign, before eventually being sent to England. His performance in these campaigns gained the respect of many of his Regular Army colleagues, such as Omar Bradley, Mark W. Clark, John P. Lucas, Troy H. Middleton, and even George S. Patton, who was normally very critical of many of his fellow senior officers. Lucas wrote about McLain, &quot;He is an exceptionally capable field artilleryman and a very gallant soldier.&quot;

During the Battle of Normandy in August 1944, McLain briefly took command of the 90th Infantry Division, which was having numerous command problems. McLain transformed the 90th into a first-class fighting formation, and led it across France in the Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine and in many numerous battles on the Western Front. In October he then assumed command of the XIX Corps, remaining its commander for the rest of the war. He was the only National Guardsman to command a corps in combat during World War II.

==Postwar==
McClain was promoted to temporary lieutenant general on 6 June 1945 and was also to brigadier general in the Regular Army. He served as Chief of Information for the US Army from 1948 to 1949. In 1949 he became the Comptroller of the United States Army, and was appointed as the Army&#x27;s first statutory comptroller general. 

In 1952 he retired from the Army after 40 years of service. At the time of his death in 1954, he was serving on President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s National Security Training Commission.

He died at Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington, D.C., on December 14, 1954, at the age of 64.

==Honors==
;Tulsa Public High School Named is his honor.
For the service and performance exhibited by McLain in his military career, the Tulsa Public Schools built and honored General McLain, by opening McLain High School, in September, 1959. In the years that followed its opening, many relatives, friends and descendants of General McLain attended school assemblies and honored him. After almost 50 years of graduating many young adults who have achieved similar excellence in their own lives from McLain, today McLain High School now serves the community in an occupational job program role.

On May 22 and 23, 2009, the McLain High School graduates of the first three classes came together for a joint class reunion and honored General McLain and the schools&#x27; 50th birthday.

==Decorations==

Lieutenant General McLain&#x27;s decorations include: Distinguished Service Cross with Oak leaf Cluster (Sicily, 1943 and France, 1944), Army Distinguished Service Medal with Oak leaf Cluster (France, 1944 and Germany, 1945), Silver Star (Italy, 1943), Legion of Merit, Bronze Star with Oak leaf Cluster (Italy, 1944 and Germany, 1945), Mexican Border Service Medal, World War I Victory Medal with two battle clasps, American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with one silver and three bronze service stars and Arrowhead device, World War II Victory Medal, Army of Occupation Medal, Chevalier of the Legion of Honor, French Croix de Guerre 1939–1945, Grand officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau with swords, Commander of the Order of Leopold II and Belgian Croix de Guerre.

<text>&quot;Live&quot; Full House is the first live album by American rock band The J. Geils Band, released in 1972.

The album peaked at #54 on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States. The tracks &quot;Looking for a Love&quot; and &quot;Serves You Right to Suffer&quot; enjoyed considerable radio airplay, thus setting up the breakthrough success of the band&#x27;s next album, 1973&#x27;s &quot;Bloodshot&quot;. The album was cited as one of the top five live rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll albums of all time by Walter de Paduwa.

The album&#x27;s cover depicts a poker hand, but the hand shown is not a &quot;full house&quot; as defined by the rules of the game (this is intentional; the Queen in the poker hand is winking). The title is also a play on words, referring to a packed concert venue or &quot;full house&quot; by concert promoters.

==Recording==
This was the first of three live albums recorded by the J. Geils Band. The others were &quot;Blow Your Face Out&quot; in 1976 and &quot;Showtime!&quot; in 1982.

Although living in Boston, the band had always considered Detroit their second home because of their enormous popularity there. Two of their three live albums were recorded in Detroit at various venues. The third live album was recorded in Detroit and Boston.
