<text>George McCready Price (26 August 1870 – 24 January 1963) was a Canadian creationist. He produced several anti-evolution and creationist works, particularly on the subject of flood geology. His views did not become common among creationists until after his death, particularly with the modern creation science movement starting in the 1960s.

== Personal life ==
Price was the father of Ernest Edward Price and grandfather of actor John Shelton, who named one of his sons Darwin to &quot;balance everything out&quot;. He is also the great great grandfather of Lake Street Dive vocalist Rachael Price.

== Biography ==
Price was born in Havelock, New Brunswick, Canada. His father died in 1882, and his mother joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Price attended Battle Creek College (now Andrews University) between 1891 and 1893. In 1896, he enrolled in a one-year teacher training course at the Provincial Normal School of New Brunswick (now the University of New Brunswick), where he took some elementary courses in some of the natural sciences, including some mineralogy.

Price taught at a series of small-town schools from 1897 onwards, including at a high school in Tracadie between 1899 and 1902. While there, socially, he met Alfred Corbett Smith (head of the medical department at a local leprosarium) who loaned him scientific literature. Believing the Earth was young, Price concluded that geologists had misinterpreted their data. In 1902, Price completed the manuscript &quot;Outlines of Modern Christianity and Modern Science&quot; before leaving Tracadie to serve brief stints as an Adventist evangelist on Prince Edward Island and the head of a new Adventist boarding academy in Nova Scotia. He briefly returned to book-selling in 1904, and then moved to New York City in an attempt to become a magazine and newspaper writer.

In a response to a plea from his wife, the Adventist church first employed Price as a construction worker in Maryland. He then was principal of a small Adventist school in Oakland, California, before becoming a construction worker and handyman at a newly purchased Adventist sanitarium in Loma Linda, California, where he published &quot;Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory&quot; in 1906. In &quot;Illogical Geology&quot;, Price offered $1000 &quot;to any one who will, in the face of the facts here presented, show me how to prove that one kind of fossil is older than another.&quot;

From 1907 to 1912, Price taught at the Seventh-day Adventist-run College of Medical Evangelists, now known as Loma Linda University, which awarded him a B.A., based partially on his authorship and independent study. From 1912 to 1914, he taught at the San Fernando Academy in San Fernando, California, and from 1914 to 1916 at Lodi Academy, Lodi, California.

Beginning in 1920, Price taught at Pacific Union College, Angwin, California, where he was awarded an M.A. (described by Ronald L. Numbers as a &quot;gift&quot;). From 1924 to 1928, Price taught at Stanborough Missionary College in Watford, England, where he served as president from 1927 to 1928. He then taught at Emmanual Missionary College (now Andrews University) in Berrien Springs, Michigan from 1929 to 1933, and Walla Walla College near Walla Walla, Washington from 1933 to 1938.

While Price claimed that his book-selling travels gave him invaluable &quot;firsthand knowledge of field geology&quot;, his &quot;familiarity with the outside world&quot; remained rudimentary, with even his own students noting that he could &quot;barely tell one fossil from another&quot; on a field trip shortly before he retired.

In 1943, he moved to Loma Linda, California, where he died 20 years later at the age of 92.

== Reception ==
In 1906 David Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University, and a leading American expert on fossil fishes, wrote a review of Price&#x27;s &quot;Illogical Geology&quot;, in which he stated that Price should not expect &quot;any geologist to take [his work] seriously.&quot; This led to a correspondence over the next twenty years in which Price once promised &quot;to become an evolutionist within twenty-four hours&quot; if &quot;the foremost ichthyologist in the world&quot; could prove that one fossil was older than another, and Jordan attempted to enlighten Price that his views were:

Jordan also unsuccessfully urged Price to &quot;undertake some constructive work in Paleontology in the field and in laboratories.&quot;

Numbers says that Seventh-day Adventism is grounded on the Sabbath doctrine of a literal Creation week. To Price, the Sabbath doctrine is what saved Adventists from evolutionism. He adopted Ellen G. White&#x27;s position on creationism as his own and he sought to persuade the world that a recent creation was required by the Bible and science.

Price criticized the &#x27;geologic ages&#x27; and strict Lyellian uniformitarianism on which he thought they were based. As an alternative explanation of the geology of the earth, he re-invented Flood geology. He pondered ways to reinterpret the apparent order of the fossils that seemingly implied ancient bygone eras. After studying a wide variety of geologic literature, Price deduced that the &quot;facts of the rocks and fossils, stripped of mere theories, splendidly refute this evolutionary theory of the invariable order of the fossils, which is the very backbone of the evolutionary doctrine.&quot; He had read of strata containing fossils of a young era lying conformably on strata containing fossils of very old eras. The geologist who described these lithically identical layers said that &quot;one would naturally suppose that a single formation was being dealt with, were it not for fossil evidence.&quot; To Price, that, and the lack of any evidence of erosion between the strata, implied that little time could have occurred between the two layers of rock. Price also discovered in the literature examples of similar conformable strata, but in the reverse order, the old rocks on top and the young strata below according to interpretation of the fossils. Although appearing &quot;to succeed one another conformably&quot; the Canadian Geologic Survey contended for over-thrusting principally based on the fossil content. Price&#x27;s interpretation of the evidence was that &quot;the geological record does not prove succession of ages, but rather shows a &quot;taxonomic&quot; series representing different but contemporaneous zones of antediluvian life.&quot;

So, in Price&#x27;s 1913 book, &quot;The Fundamentals of Geology&quot;, an expanded version of &quot;Illogical Geology&quot;, he presented the &quot;Law of Conformable Stratigraphic Sequences&quot; which states &quot;any kind of fossiliferous rock may occur conformably on any other kind of fossiliferous rock, old or young.&quot; To Price this law was &quot;by all odds the most important law ever formulated with reference to the order in which the strata occur.&quot;

Yale geologist Schuchert&#x27;s review of &quot;The New Geology&quot; for the magazine &quot;Science&quot; stated that Price was &quot;harboring a geological nightmare&quot;. However, the creationists welcomed the new book. Harry Rimmer claimed that it was &quot;a masterpiece of REAL science [that] explodes in a convincing manner some of the ancient fallacies of science &#x27;falsely so called&#x27;&quot;. Within a couple of years, Price appeared prominently in several conservative religious periodicals. A &quot;Science&quot; editor described him as &quot;the principal scientific authority of the Fundamentalists&quot;.

Price, concerned about scientific methodology, had read Whithead and other philosophers and understood that facts were always subject to interpretation. While Price was confident that &quot;inductive geology&quot; inferred a recent Creation, he acknowledged that debate between creationism and naturalism lay outside of science, &quot;across the boundary-line in the domain of philosophy and theology.&quot; He claimed that naturalists regarded facts &quot;through the colored spectacles of Darwin and Lyell&quot; while Creationists used the Bible to interpret the natural world. He said that the Creationist account of origins could never have been developed as a hypothesis from the study of nature alone, rather it was &quot;suggested by our religion.&quot; In choosing between &quot;the two alternatives now before the world,&quot; naturalistic geology versus world-catastrophe, there was but one suitable inquiry: &quot;Will it give the most rational account nature&#x27;s evidence?&quot;

Price&#x27;s defense of creation science (and attacks on evolution) first achieved wide notability in 1925 when his theories and arguments were utilized heavily by William Jennings Bryan in the famous Scopes Trial. Bryan had appealed to Price for assistance, but Price was busy teaching in England. Price advised Bryan to avoid science during the trial if possible. During the trial, defense counsel Clarence Darrow, sneered &quot;You mentioned Price because he is the only human being in the world so far as you know that signs his name as a geologist that believes like you do . . . every scientist in this country knows [he] is a mountebank and a pretender and not a geologist at all.&quot;

Price&#x27;s ideas were borrowed again in the early 1960s by Henry M. Morris and John Whitcomb in their book &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot;, a work that skeptic Martin Gardner calls &quot;the most significant attack on evolution...since the Scopes trial&quot;. Morris, in his 1984 book &quot;History of Modern Creationism&quot;, spoke glowingly of Price&#x27;s logic and writing style, and referred to reading &quot;The New Geology&quot; as &quot;a life-changing experience for me&quot;.

== Comments about Old Earth creationists ==
Price was more conservative in his views than Old Earth creationists such as William Jennings Bryan, Harry Rimmer or William Bell Riley. Contrary to Bryan, Rimmer and Riley, Price rejected the idea of a local flood and insisted on a pure literal 6-day creation consisting of six 24-hour days. He felt that Riley&#x27;s day-age creationist views were &quot;the devil&#x27;s counterfeit&quot;. Price was equally dismissive of Rimmer, and his gap creationism for most of his career.

<doc id="1263786" wikidata="Q3222449" url="?curid=1263786" title="Le Droit">
<text>Le Droit is a Canadian French-language digital weekly newspaper, published in Gatineau, Quebec. Initially established and owned by the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the paper was published by Martin Cauchon and his company, Capitales Médias, from 2015 - 2019, when a cooperative was formed by the employees to continue publishing the paper.

Formerly published in Ottawa, Ontario, for much of its history, it was the only francophone daily newspaper published in Ontario for the Franco-Ontarian community. Amid the context of the media profitability crunch of the late 2010s, it closed its Ottawa offices in 2019, moving across the river to Gatineau in order to qualify for special tax credits being offered by the government of Quebec to preserve endangered media outlets, although the newspaper reiterated that it would continue to cover Ottawa-related news.

The newspaper switched from daily to weekly publication in 2020, and dropped print issues to become digital-only at the end of 2023.

==History==
The newspaper was launched on March 27, 1913 as a tool to condemn Regulation 17, an Ontario law that restricted education in French at that time. Today, it defends federalism in Canada as well as provincial jurisdictions. It is still involved in the protection of francophone rights in Ontario, notably advocating for the survival of the Montfort Hospital during the government of Ontario premier Mike Harris.

In the 1960s, &quot;Le Droit&quot; tried to extend its market into Northeastern Ontario, including the North Bay, Timmins and Sudbury areas, all of which have large francophone populations. However, it quickly abandoned the project due to high costs. Originally published as a broadsheet, it switched to tabloid format in 1988, following an 11-week strike by the pressmen. The newspaper also had a previous strike in 1982.

In 2001, Gesca, a subsidiary of Power Corporation owned by Franco-Ontarian Paul Desmarais acquired the paper from Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger, who owned it between 1987 and 2001. In the eighties, it belonged to Montreal-based Jacques Francoeur, the founder of Sunday weekly &quot;Dimanche-Matin&quot;, who built the Unimedia chain which included &quot;Le Soleil&quot; (Quebec City) and &quot;Le Quotidien&quot; (Chicoutimi, now Saguenay). He acquired &quot;Le Droit&quot; from the Oblates.

In 2015, Gesca sold six of its francophone titles, including &quot;Le Droit,&quot; to Martin Cauchon, a former minister in the Jean Chrétien government. Terms were not disclosed.

In 2020, the paper switched from printing six times a week to once a week on Saturdays. Three years later the last print edition of the newspaper was published on December 30, 2023. Moving forward the publication will be entirely digital.

The publisher since 2007 is Jacques Pronovost. Before him, it was led by Claude Gagnon (2002–2007), Pierre Bergeron (1993–2002), Gilbert Lacasse (1987–1993) and Jean-Robert Bélanger ( – 1987). Managing editors have included Jean Gagnon (?), André Larocque (2006–2010), Michel Gauthier (2001–2006), François Roy (1994–2001), Claude Beauregard (1994), Gilbert Lavoie (1991–1994), and André Préfontaine (1989–1991).

==Today==
It is also read by the Franco-Ontarian community and was the fourth all-time francophone newspaper (the previous three existed in the 19th century). Its articles can also be read on the internet in the Cyberpresse network, which also includes &quot;La Presse&quot; in Montreal, &quot;Le Soleil&quot; in Quebec City, &quot;Le Nouvelliste&quot; in Trois-Rivières, &quot;La Tribune&quot; in Sherbrooke, &quot;La Voix de l&#x27;Est&quot; in Granby and &quot;Le Quotidien&quot; in Saguenay.

Its main offices were located near the ByWard Market, with a second office located at Les Promenades Gatineau in Gatineau, until the move to Gatineau. It currently has about 150 employees.

==Controversy==

In 2008, Sudbury&#x27;s francophone community newspaper &quot;Le Voyageur&quot; published an editorial criticizing the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission for its handling of Le5 Communications&#x27; application to acquire two francophone radio stations, CHYC-FM in Sudbury and CHYK-FM in Timmins. The paper took issue with the fact that the CRTC&#x27;s original notice of hearing was published only in &quot;Le Droit&quot;, and not in any of the region&#x27;s local media—thereby giving the francophone community in Northeastern Ontario little notice of either the pending transaction or the deadlines for reviewing and submitting comments regarding the application.

<text>The Gunboat War (, , Swedish: &quot;Kanonbåtskriget&quot;; 1807–1814) was a naval conflict between Denmark–Norway and Great Britain supported by Sweden during the Napoleonic Wars. The war&#x27;s name is derived from the Danish tactic of employing small gunboats against the materially superior Royal Navy. In Scandinavia it is seen as the later stage of the English Wars, whose commencement is accounted as the First Battle of Copenhagen in 1801.

==Background==
The naval conflict between Britain and Denmark-Norway commenced with the First Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 when Horatio Nelson&#x27;s squadron of Admiral Hyde Parker&#x27;s fleet attacked the Danish capital. This came as a basis of Denmark-Norway&#x27;s policy of armed neutrality during the latter stages of the French Revolutionary Wars, where Denmark used its naval forces to protect trade flowing within, into and out of the Danish-Norwegian waters. Hostilities between Denmark-Norway and the United Kingdom broke out again by the Second Battle of Copenhagen in 1807, when the British attacked the Danish capital to ensure that the Danish-Norwegian fleet did not fall into the hands of Napoleon.

==Danish boat design==
As a result of the British capture or scuttling of large parts of the Danish-Norwegian fleet during the assault on Copenhagen, the Dano-Norwegian government decided to build gunboats in large numbers to compensate for the loss. The gunboats were originally designed by a Swede, Fredrik Henrik af Chapman, and the strategic advantage of gunboats lay in the fact that they could be produced rapidly and inexpensively throughout the kingdoms. The tactical advantages were that they were highly manoeuvrable, especially in still and shallow waters and presented small targets. On the other hand, the boats were vulnerable and likely to sink from a single hit. They therefore could not be used in rough seas, and they were less effective against large warships. Still, the Danish-Norwegian government produced more than 200 gunboats in two models: the shallop gunboat which had a crew of 76 men, with an 18- or 24-pounder cannon in the bow and another in the stern, and the smaller barge type that had a total crew of 24 men, armed with a single 24-pounder.
The Danish Commodore (later, Admiral) Steen Andersen Bille (1751–1833) is credited with being the driving force behind the post-1807 Dano-Norwegian strategy of gunboat warfare. Below is a description of each of the four classes of gunboats according to Junior Lieutenant Hans Georg Garde, himself a commander of one of the larger types of gunboats. 
*Kanonchaluppen: These were the larger type of gunboat. Each was armed with two 24-pounder cannon and four 4-pounder howitzers and had a wartime establishment of 69 – 79 men.
*Kanonjollen: These were the smaller type of gunboat. Each was armed with one 24-pounder cannon and two 4-pounder howitzers, and had wartime establishment of 41 men.
*Morterchaluppen: These were the larger, mortar-armed gunboats. Each was armed with one 100-pounder mortar and two 4-pounder howitzers, and had a wartime establishment of 40 men.
*Morterbarkasserne: These were smaller, mortar-armed gunboats. Each was armed with one mortar and had a wartime establishment of 19 men. They were little more than ordinary ships&#x27; boats into which a mortar had been set. They had a tendency to leak badly after 5 – 7 mortar shells had been fired. Their crews then had to bring them back into harbour, remove the mortar, and recaulk their vessels.

Reserve crew who could not be accommodated on board were quartered in buildings on land or in the frigate &quot;Triton&quot; which was in ordinary. Battle-ready gunboats had their crews on board.

Defences on the Norwegian coast in 1808 are listed at Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy order of battle in Norway (1808). Ten schooner-rigged gunboats capable of operating in the rougher Norwegian Sea were built in Bergen and Trondheim in the years 1808 to 1811.

==War==
In the first three years of the Gunboat War, these boats were on several occasions able to seize enemy cargo ships from their convoys and to capture British brigs, though they were not strong enough to overcome larger frigates and ships of the line. The British had control of Danish waters during the whole of the 1807–1814 war, and when the season was suited to navigation they were regularly able to escort large merchant convoys out through the Sound and the Great Belt. Although the discussion below focuses on armed encounters involving an exchange of fire, one must keep in mind that the British also captured numerous Danish privateers without firing a shot, and regularly seized Danish merchant vessels as prizes. The British also conducted amphibious landings on several Danish islands, many populated but lacking garrisons. British warships frequently landed to replenish their stocks of firewood, fresh water and livestock, which were purchased or seized to augment their provisions.

The war overlapped, in time, the Anglo-Russian War. As a result, the British expanded their trade embargo to Russian waters and the British navy conducted forays northwards into the Barents Sea. The British navy conducted successful raids on Hasvik and Hammerfest and disrupted the Pomor trade, the Norwegian trade with Russia.

===1807–08===
On 12 August 1807, even before the war had been declared, the British sixth-rate took part in a one-sided single-ship action when she captured the 32-gun Danish frigate (&quot;fregat&quot;) &quot;Friderichsværn&quot;. In the engagement the British suffered only one man wounded; the Danes lost 12 men while 20 were wounded, some mortally. &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s List&quot; described the Danish vessel as a &quot;Danish Frigate, of 32 Guns, late Guardship&quot;, and reported that the action, near Elsinor, had been short. The Royal Navy took &quot;Frederiksværn&quot; into service as .

On 23 August, the British fired Congreve rockets from her decks against a Danish gunboat flotilla, but the attack had little effect. The British were instead more successful on 11 September when brought to the British Admiralty the despatches from Admiral Thomas McNamara Russell announcing the capitulation of the small island of Heligoland to the British. Heligoland later also became a centre for smuggling and for espionage against Napoleon.
In the East Indies, troops from the 14th Regiment of Foot landed from on the Coromandel Coast on 13 February 1808 and took over the Danish possessions at Tranquebar. On 14 March, the 14-gun and the Danish 20-gun sloop HDMS &quot;Lougen&quot; engaged in an inconclusive single-ship action. &quot;Childers&quot; lost two men killed and nine wounded before she could escape and return to Leith. On 22 March the British ships of the line HMS &quot;Nassau&quot; and destroyed the last Danish ship of the line, HDMS &quot;Prinds Christian Frederik&quot;, commanded by Captain C.W. Jessen, in the Battle of Zealand Point. &quot;Nassau&quot; was herself a former Danish warship. &quot;Nassau&quot; had one man killed and 16 men wounded, while &quot;Stately&quot; had four killed and 27 wounded. The Danes lost 55 men killed and 88 wounded.

Boats from and , supported by the brig , drove ashore a Dano-Norwegian convoy at Flodstrand, near The Skaw on 22 April. The convoy was taking supplies to Norway as a result of supply shortages that had occurred there after the British had begun their naval blockade between Denmark and Norway in 1807. The British went in under heavy fire from the shore and a castle there and brought out five brigs, three galliots, a schooner, and a sloop (totalling some 870 tons burthen), for the loss of five men wounded. The British frigate also approached Bergen under Dutch colours on 15 May in order to attack the Dutch frigate &quot;Guelderland&quot;, which had been undergoing repairs there. Unfortunately for the British the &quot;Guelderland&quot; had already sailed, so during the night the British sent in boats in an attempt to capture Danish shipping in the harbour. When the boats came under heavy fire, &quot;Tartar&quot; came in to cover them, only to come under attack by the schooner &quot;Odin&quot; and five gunboats. During the Battle of Alvøen &quot;Tartar″&quot;s captain and another seaman were killed and twelve men were wounded before &quot;Tartar&quot; was able to make her escape.
The hired armed cutter &quot;Swan&quot; found herself in action off the island of Bornholm with a Danish 8-gun cutter-rigged vessel on 24 May. &quot;Swan&quot; had been carrying despatches when she had spotted the Danish vessel and lured her out. The engagement ended with the Danish vessel exploding, while &quot;Swan&quot; suffered no casualties despite coming under fire both from the Danish vessel and batteries on Bornholm. The fire from the batteries and the sighting of more Danish vessels forced &quot;Swan&quot; to withdraw after the battle without being able to make efforts to rescue survivors.

On 4 June four Danish gunboats attacked and captured her after a four-hour fight. &quot;Tickler&quot; had lost her captain and 14 other men killed, and 22 other officers and men killed and wounded out of her crew of 50 men; the Danes had one man wounded. The Danes would later use &quot;Tickler&quot; as a cadet training ship.

The Danes were also victorious on 19 June, when the brig pursued and caught up with the Danish brig HDMS &quot;Lougen&quot;, which was armed with eighteen short 18-pounder guns and two long 6-pounder guns. About 20 minutes into the engagement six Danish gunboats arrived from behind some rocks and in two divisions of three each took up positions on &quot;Seagull″&quot;s quarter and fired on her with their 24-pounder guns while &quot;Lougen&quot; fired on her larboard bow. Within half an hour the Danish fire had badly damaged &quot;Seagull″&quot;s rigging and dismounted five of her guns. Eventually &quot;Seagull&quot; struck, having lost eight men killed and 20 wounded, including her captain, R.B. Cathcart. &quot;Seagull&quot; sank soon after the Danes captured her, drowning several of her captors who were aboard. The Danes later recovered &quot;Seagull&quot; and added her to their navy.
The Danes also captured . Sixteen Danish gunboats captured her off Langeland in the Great Belt on 2 August. In the engagement &quot;Tigress&quot; lost two men killed and eight wounded.

Immobilized by a dead calm, , under Captain John Barrett, barely survived an attack by 25 Danish gunboats and seven armed launches under the command of Commodore J.C. Krieger in an action in the Øresund on 20 October 1808. &quot;Africa&quot; lost nine men killed and 51 wounded; had night not descended the Danes might well have captured her. The British, however, were less fortunate on 5 December, when the bomb vessel was wrecked on Anholt Reef while caught in the ice. The reason that the vessel sank in that area was because the Danes had closed the lighthouse on the island of Anholt, in the Kattegat early during the war, and the Admiralty had ordered her to station herself off the island on 9 November to carry a light for the safety of passing convoys. All her crew was however saved.

===1809–10===
The British 64-gun third rate , under Captain Aiskew Paffard Hollis, and the 18-pounder 36-gun frigate captured the island of Anholt on 18 May 1809. A party of seamen and marines under the command of Captain William Selby of &quot;Owen Glendower&quot;, with the assistance of Captain Edward Nicolls of the &quot;Standard&quot;″s marines, landed. The Danish garrison of 170 men put up a sharp, but ineffectual resistance that killed one British marine and wounded two before the garrison then surrendered and the British took immediate possession of the island. The principal objective of the mission was to restore the lighthouse on Anholt to its pre-war state to facilitate the movement of British men of war and merchantmen navigating the dangerous seas there.

On 9 June a Danish and Norwegian flotilla of twenty-one gunboats and seven mortar boats attacked a British convoy of 70 merchant ships off the island of Saltholm in Øresund Strait near Copenhagen. The Dano-Norwegian flotilla was able to capture 12 or 13 merchant vessels, plus , one of the escorts. The Danes also captured HMS &quot;Allart&quot; during the Battle of Saltholm on 10 August. During the battle HMS &quot;Allart&quot;, a former Danish Navy brig, chased &quot;Lougen&quot; and &quot;Seagull&quot; into Fredriksvern only to find herself pursued by 15 Danish gunboats, arrayed in three divisions. After a three-hour chase the gunboats closed with &quot;Allart&quot; and an engagement began. After two hours &quot;Allart&quot; struck, having had her rigging shot away and having lost one man killed and three wounded.

On 12 August, Commander John Willoughby Marshall and were in the company of the gun-brig , Lieutenant Thomas Fitzgerald, when they discovered three Danish luggers off the Danish coast. The water was too shallow for &quot;Lynx&quot;, so Marshall sent &quot;Monkey&quot; and boats from &quot;Lynx&quot; in to cut them out. The largest of the luggers, which had four guns and four howitzers, opened fire on &quot;Monkey&quot; before all three luggers ran ashore once &quot;Monkey&quot; and the launch&#x27;s 18-pounder carronade returned fire. The British refloated the luggers and brought them out the next day, having taken no casualties. In their haste to escape the vessel, the Danes failed to fire the fuse on a cask of gunpowder they had left by the fireplace on the largest lugger. Marshall thought the Danes&#x27; behaviour in leaving the explosive device disgraceful.

The Danish-Norwegian navy managed to capture another British vessel on 2 September, when a Danish gunboat flotilla from Fladstrand, North Jutland, under the command of Lieutenant Nicolai H. Tuxen, captured the gun-brig . The engagement cost &quot;Minx&quot; two dead and nine wounded. The British Royal Navy had stationed her off the Skaw Reef to show a warning light. reported the loss to the Admiralty.

Early in 1810, the Danes ceased sending provisioning ships to Norway because of British naval activity in Øresund and withdrew the naval officers that were so involved to Zealand. Meanwhile, there were difficulties in transporting grain from Vordingborg, in the south of Denmark, past Møn to Copenhagen. This was overcome by using gunboats to convoy the merchant vessels, as the gunboats were much more maneuverable in the shallow coastal waters, and restricting the cargo vessels to those which could pass inside of Møn. Larger seagoing ships which would have to go outside, i.e. east of Møn, were too liable to be caught by the British. These actions, together with a good form of coastal signalling, resulted in a steady supply of grain to the Danish capital.

On 13 April 1810, four Danish gunboats, under the command of First Lieutenant Peter Nicolay Skibsted, captured the British gunboat off the Djursland peninsula near Grenå. &quot;Grinder&quot; was armed with one 24-pounder gun and one 24-pounder carronade. She was under the command of Master&#x27;s Mate Thomas Hester and had over-wintered at Anholt. Of her crew of 34 men, two were killed and two wounded in the action.

On 23 May, seven Danish gunboats engaged the , , and His Majesty&#x27;s hired armed cutter , off the Skaw. The engagement cost the Danes the loss of one gunboat, which blew up, and heavy damage to the rest.

The Battle of Silda was fought on 23 July near the Norwegian island of Silda. The British frigates and attacked the pilot&#x27;s station on the island and defeated the three gun schooners , and and the gun barge , which were stationed there.

On 12 September, six Danish gunboats captured a becalmed &quot;Alban&quot; after a four-hour battle during which she lost her captain and one man killed and three men wounded. The Danes then took her into service as &quot;The Alban&quot;.

===1811–14===
Danish gunboats manned by nearly 1,000 men, including infantry forces attempted to recapture Anholt on 27 February 1811. The Battle of Anholt resulted in a Danish withdrawal to Jutland, with heavy losses. The Danes did however emerge victorious on 23 April when &quot;Swan&quot; encountered three Danish gunboats in Sunningesund. A shot from one of the gunboats damaged &quot;Swan&quot; and resulted in the wetting of her powder magazine, forcing her surrender. The Danes boarded her but were able to retrieve little before &quot;Swan&quot; sank off Uddevalla, on the Swedish coast north of Gothenburg. The fight cost &quot;Swan&quot; two men killed, as the same battle apparently also resulted in the damaging of the hired armed cutter &quot;Hero&quot;. On 11 May, recaptured &quot;Alban&quot; from the Danes. The capture occurred after a 12-hour chase near Shetland. At the time of her capture &quot;Alban&quot; was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 58 men, all under the command of a lieutenant of the Danish navy. She was three days out of Farsund in Norway and had taken no prizes.
On 31 July 1811, and were cruising together in Long Sound, Norway, when they encountered and engaged three Danish brigs: the 20-gun &quot;Langeland&quot;, the 18-gun &quot;Lügum&quot;, and the 16-gun &quot;Kiel&quot;. Outnumbered and outgunned, the British vessels took flight. The next day &quot;Brev Drageren&quot; unsuccessfully re-engaged first one and then two of the brigs. In the inconclusive engagement each British vessel sustained one man killed, and &quot;Brev Drageren&quot; also had three wounded. On 17 August sailed from Sheerness with a convoy for the Baltic. On 2 September, while she was cruising off Arendal on the Norwegian coast in the company of , three Danish 18-gun-brigs (&quot;Alsen&quot;, &quot;Lolland&quot;, and &quot;Samsø&quot;) engaged them. &quot;Lolland&quot; engaged &quot;Manly&quot; while the other two chased &quot;Chanticleer&quot; but she maintained a course away from the action and made good her escape. In the engagement with &quot;Lolland&quot;, &quot;Manly&quot; had her spars and rigging cut to pieces. With only six guns left, and having lost one man killed and three wounded, &quot;Manly&quot; was forced to strike.
The last major fight between Danish-Norwegian and British warships took place on 6 July 1812 during the Battle of Lyngør, when a small squadron of British warships met a small squadron of Norwegian warships at Lyngør on the Norwegian coast. The British withdrew after destroying the Norwegian frigate &quot;Najaden&quot;. On 2 August the same year, boats of , which was under the command of Captain Lord George Stuart, captured two Danish vessels, under the command of Lieutenant Hans Buderhof, and their prize, an American vessel of about 400 tons burthen (bm). The two Danish vessels were schooner No. 114 (of six 6-pounders and 30 men), and cutter No. 97 (of four 6-pounders and 22 men). In the action the British lost nine men killed and 16 wounded, of whom two died of their wounds; the Danes lost ten men killed and 13 wounded.

== Peace ==
As a result of the Swedish invasion of Holstein in December 1813 during the War of the Sixth Coalition, Denmark-Norway was forced to seek peace, and the Treaty of Kiel ended the war on 14 January 1814. Denmark-Norway had to cede Heligoland to Britain and the Kingdom of Norway (except for Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands) to the King of Sweden, while Denmark did get back the island of Anholt and was compensated for the loss of Norway with the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg. However, this treaty was not accepted by the Norwegian people, who refused to be simply a bargaining chip, and a war between Norway and Sweden broke out on 26 July.

<text>The Battle of Sehested was fought on 10 December 1813 during the Dano-Swedish War of 1813–1814 between a Danish army under Prince Frederik of Hesse and a Coalition force led by Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn. Near Sehested, Holstein, Frederik&#x27;s troops defeated the Coalition army, inflicting over 1,100 casualties on von Wallmoden-Gimborn&#x27;s force while suffering only 500. However, this victory did not prevent the Coalition from emerging victorious in the conflict in 1814. 

==Background==

Denmark-Norway found itself involved in the Napoleonic Wars following the Battle of Copenhagen in 1807. To prevent the Dano-Norwegian navy from falling into French hands, British forces attacked and briefly occupied Copenhagen, capturing most of the Dano-Norwegian fleet at anchor. Denmark-Norway, which up till then maintained its neutrality in the conflict, thereafter sided openly with France. While keeping faith with this alliance, Frederick VI of Denmark tried to keep the country out of military campaigns as much as possible, and Danish troops did not go beyond a generic employment as occupational troops in the northern regions of Germany.

Following the French defeat in the Russian Campaign, at the beginning of 1813, Denmark-Norway formally declared a state of neutrality. The country was bankrupt and more than ever needed a return to peace to restore its disastrous economy. The negotiations initiated by Frederick IV with the powers of the sixth anti-French coalition, however, were unsuccessful. The Coalition favored Sweden&#x27;s claims for an annexation of Norway, and in March 1813, the king decided to renew his treaty of alliance with France; a Danish expeditionary force, 13,000 strong under the orders of Prince Frederik of Hesse (brother-in-law of the monarch) was then deployed in the Schleswig-Holstein region and supported the forces of Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout in his campaigns in the Hamburg area against the multinational troops of the Russian general Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn.

Shortly after Napoleon’s defeat at Leipzig on 19 October 1813, Davout received orders to defend against the advancing Coalition armies. Davout successfully prepared the defense of Hamburg and made the decision to establish a defensive line behind the Stecknitz River. French infantry divisions were placed to defend the southern portion of the line while the Danish Auxiliary Corps (DAC) under the command of Prince Frederik was ordered to defend the northern part of the line, from Travemünde to an area north of Mölln. 

Wallmoden commanded the Coalition army given the responsibility to commence offensive operations against the French. The Coalition plan called for the French divisions to be surrounded and besieged in Hamburg. Once the French had been surrounded in Hamburg the offensive would advance north to isolate and destroy the DAC opening Denmark for invasion. The defeat or surrender of the Danish army would then allow Sweden to take possession of Norway. As a part of this plan, Wallmoden&#x27;s army was reinforced with a Swedish corps and placed under the overall command of Prince Karl Johan of Sweden.

In late November, Davout realized that a major enemy offensive was forthcoming. He instantly began drawing up plans for the French withdrawal to Hamburg. This left the defence of Holstein in the hands of the DAC. On 30 November, Davout withdrew his French divisions to Hamburg. On 9 December, Coalition forces crossed the Alster River, severed the passage way between Hamburg and Holstein, and isolated the Danes. A short time later, Prince Frederik learned that the French corps was surrounded in Hamburg.

With no means to reach Hamburg, the Danish army left their defensive position in Lübeck and withdrew north toward Bornhöved. At the same time, Coalition forces under the command of Wallmoden moved north in an attempt to block the Danish line of retreat. The Danish crossed the Eider Canal and took positions near Gettorf and Lindau. Elements of Wallmoden&#x27;s corps by that time had reached Sehested. The Danish army knew that Wallmoden was on their heels and had two alternatives. If they continued to march north, they feared that their slow convoy would be attacked by a Swedish cavalry division now located in Wittensee. If they marched west in an attempt to reach a defensive position at Rendsborg, they would likely cross paths and be forced to confront Wallmoden’s infantry. On 10 December, Prince Frederik made his decision and issued orders to march west toward Sehested.

==Battle==
===Holtsee and Haby===
As the head of the Danish force was reaching the town of Holtsee, an enemy force could be seen in occupation. French General Lallemand&#x27;s Advanced Guard deployed into battle formation, and the Danish vanguard halted to allow them to clear the enemy from the village. Major Baumberg, commanding the Coalition forces holding Holtsee, spotted the Danish army, but had no intention of engaging an entire corps with only three battalions. As such, he slowly began to withdraw west to the town of Haby, facing southeast.

When the main Danish the Polish Cavalry Regiment to observe Baumberg&#x27;s movements east of Haby. At the same time, he also sent two battalions of the Holstein Regiment, the battalion of the Queen&#x27;s Regiment, and a hussar squadron to cover the area to the northeast of Holtsee.

Baumberg&#x27;s slow withdrawal had given time for Wallmoden to bring up the rest of his troops from Sehested. However as the Danish troops continued to advance, he allowed himself to be pushed back towards the village. When Danish troops passed the southern end of the causeway leading through Haby, a detachment under Major Berger was left to prevent Baumberg from descending on the rear of the convoy. This was just in time as, within a few minutes, Baumberg&#x27;s force attempted to storm the vanguard. This task was virtually impossible, as they could only form up in a column eight men wide, and the attack was beaten off with such heavy casualties, that Baumberg was effectively cut out of the action. The units left to track him east of Haby, were now joined by the four squadrons of cavalry from Holtsee, and as a consequence of this disastrous attack, these units were now free to begin to march towards the Sehested road and the rear of the vanguard.

===Danish attack on Sehested===
Wallmoden then pulled back to Sehested, where he turned to face the Danish army, forming up at the north of the long, straggling town, just south of the point where the Rendsborg road took a sharp right turn, with his left just north of the marsh which ran along the western side of the town on the river Eider. A &quot;Jäger&quot; battalion from Mecklenburg-Schwerin was sent across the river in the direction of Holtsee, to see if they could harass the Danish vanguard with long range musketry. Seeing their enemy taking up this position, the Danish once again halted, and prepared for battle. The 1st and 4th battalions of the Oldenburg regiments formed into columns, and supported by the fire of Gonner&#x27;s and Koye&#x27;s batteries, attacked Sehested, screened by a musketeer company of the 1st battalion and the &quot;Jäger&quot; company of the 4th. The 6th and 7th battalions of the Russian–German Legion immediately counterattacked, and supported by the 5th battalion, threw the Danish army back to its previous position.

Prince Frederik renewed the attack and pushed the Coalition forces back to the northern part of Sehested. The 6th and 7th battalions of the Russian-German Legion prepared a new defense, but were soon overrun. By 10 o’clock, Sehested was entirely in Danish hands. The Danish army formed a line alongside the southern edge of the town and a detachment under Major Bie, consisting of the 1st battalion of the Funen Infantry Regiment and the Friis battery, were sent to cover the ground between Sehested and Hohenfelde, which the Coalition left wing had retreated across. Wallmoden now ordered the Sehested to be retaken and the 5th and 6th battalions of the Legion and the Anhalt-Dessau battalion, under covering fire from a horse artillery battery of the British Army&#x27;s King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL) and a Hanoverian foot artillery battery, returned to the fray, attacking in columns.

===Wallmoden&#x27;s counterattack and retreat===

The leading column of the 5th battalion of the Legion was charged by the Funen Dragoon Regiment, but despite the attempt, was unable to form an infantry square in time. The survivors were taken prisoner, as were the crew of the KGL artillery battery and one of the Hanoverian guns. The other two battalions broke and routed back to safety, whilst the captured artillery pieces were dragged back into the Danish lines. The Coalition forces withdrew 500 metres down the Osterrode road, and took up a new position, with their left resting on Hohenfelde, and their right on the Eider. On their left, a fierce engagement developed between the 1st and 2nd battalions of the Russian-German Legion and Bie&#x27;s force, with the outnumbered Danish getting the worst of it. After realizing his men had run out of ammunition, Bie was forced back about halfway to the Rendborg road, alongside the vanguard. Fortunately for the Danish army, the Holstein Cavalry Regiment and the Polish Cavalry Regiment from Haby, arrived and pushed the Coalition left wing back to its main body.

In a desperate attempt to break the Danish line, Wallmoden ordered Mecklenburg-Schwerin mounted &quot;Jägers&quot; to charge the southern part of Sehested. They were eventually routed by musketfire from the 2nd battalion of the Funen Regiment and the 1st battalion of the Schleswig Regiment. Realising that he could no longer hope to hold his position, Wallmoden ordered a retreat over the Eider to a position on the low heights around Osterrode. Prince Frederik ordered the Holstein Cavalry Regiment forward to try and convert this retreat into a rout, but their attack were beaten off by overwhelming Coalition musketfire and they fell back to the northern bank of the Eider. From there, they began an artillery bombardment on Wallmoden&#x27;s position, as well as scouting on Vegesack&#x27;s division, which had just arrived and was now occupying a position between Wakendorf and Bovenau to the west of the canal. Under heavy bombardment, Wallmoden now began to withdraw across the Cluvensieck bridge, taking up a defensive position facing back across the canal.

===End of battle===
Charles XIV John had now arrived on the scene, and after a short discussion with Wallmoden and Vegesack, sent a messenger to Prince Frederik suggesting a twenty-four hour ceasefire, in order to collect the wounded and bury the dead, to which Frederik agreed. The Danish troops marched after the vanguard, while a rearguard was kept on the left of the Mühlenerg, to prevent any attempt at pursuit. The battle was over. For the Danish army, they had achieved their objective of clearing the road to Rendsburg, whilst the Coalition suffered an unhoped defeat. The Coalition lost 1,100 men in total, while the Danish lost approximately 500 men.

==Aftermath==
The Danish army reached Rendsburg without further incident, where it established a defensive position along the course of the Eider; with Napoleon beaten and fleeing to France, however, King Frederick IV realized the futility of any further resistance and immediately signed an armistice with the Coalition powers in order to start peace negotiations. The negotiations eventually led to the signing, on January 14, 1814, of the Treaty of Kiel, which ended the participation of Denmark-Norway in the Napoleonic Wars.

<doc id="1263819" wikidata="Q7872584" url="?curid=1263819" title="USS PC-1264">
<text>USS &quot;PC-1264&quot; was a built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was one of only two U.S. Navy ships to have a predominantly African-American enlisted complement during the war, the other being the .

&quot;PC-1264&quot; was in service for less than two years, but the performance of her crew—and of USS &quot;Mason&quot;″s—led the U.S. Navy to reevaluate its perception of African Americans as members of the fleet. Although sold for scrapping, the ship remains at the Donjon Marine Yard in Rossville, Staten Island, New York.

==Career==
USS &quot;PC-1264&quot; was laid down at Consolidated Shipbuilding Company in Morris Heights, Bronx, New York, on 7 October 1943 and launched on 28 November 1943. &quot;PC-1264&quot; was a United States Navy . This patrol class of submarine chaser was intended to intercept and destroy German U-boats stationed off the coast of the United States. Less expensive and faster to build than destroyers or even destroyer escorts, and requiring smaller crews, they quickly filled an important need for coastal convoy protection and anti-submarine warfare.

&quot;PC-1264&quot; was commissioned in April 1944 and decommissioned in February 1946, serving a little less than 22 months as a U.S. Navy fighting ship.

===Segregated ships===

On 9 December 1941, the NAACP sent a telegram to Frank Knox, U.S. Secretary of the Navy, asking that African Americans be accepted into the navy in other than the messman branch. This request was refused. A 17 December letter from the NAACP to President Roosevelt resulted in the president turning the matter over to Mark Ethridge, chairman of the Fair Employment Practices Committee. This committee also received a negative response from the Navy Department. The president then sent a note to Secretary Knox stating:

I think that with all the Navy activities, BUNAV might find something that colored enlistees could do in addition to the rating of messman.

The navy&#x27;s General Board, the group charged with the formulation of navy policy, countered with a suggestion that African Americans either be enlisted as messmen, or, &quot;...if this proved not feasible,&quot; for general service. The problem was that the navy believed that integrated units would disrupt discipline aboard ships, entirely ignoring the fact that integrated crews had worked successfully aboard U.S. Navy ships during the American Civil War. The president responded, agreeing that &quot;...to go the whole way in one fell swoop would seriously impair the general average efficiency of the Navy,&quot; but still felt that something could be worked out. On 27 March 1942, the Board replied, &quot;The General Board fully recognizes, and appreciates the social and economic problems involved, and has striven to reconcile these requirements with what it feels must be paramount at any consideration, namely the maintenance at the highest level of the fighting efficiency of the Navy...&quot;, adding that &quot;...if so ordered..&quot; Negro units could be used &quot;...with least disadvantage...&quot; in shore establishments, local defense vessels, construction units and selected Coast Guard cutters.

On 7 April, the president &#x27;so ordered,&#x27; and the navy announced that—beginning on 1 June—Negroes could enlist for the general service. As a result, the groundwork was laid for establishing African-American crews on USS &quot;Mason&quot; and USS &quot;PC-1264&quot;.

===Commanding officers and POs===

White officer Lieutenant Eric S. Purdon served as &quot;PC-1264&quot;″s commanding officer from her commissioning on 25 April 1944 until 17 September 1945. He was replaced by his engineering officer, Lieutenant (jg) Ernest V. Hardman, who served as skipper until 31 October 1945. The third commanding officer was Lieutenant (jg) Jack W. Sutherland who came aboard on 31 October and helped decommission &quot;PC-1264&quot; on 7 February 1946.

From that point, until &quot;PC-1264&quot; was out of service, she was in the charge of African American Ensign Samuel L. Gravely, Jr. Ensign Gravely had first reported aboard on 2 May 1945, and, at the time of the ship&#x27;s decommissioning, was serving as her executive officer. &quot;PC-1264&quot; was the first sailing assignment of future Admiral Gravely, the first African American to attain that rank.

In addition to the all-white officer complement, until the day Ensign Gravely reported aboard, eight white navy Petty Officers (PO), one in each specialty required on &quot;PC-1264&quot;, were also assigned to the ship. Their job was to train the African-American crew until Lt. Purdon considered some of the men expert enough in their specialty to rate promotion to petty officer. Months later, when eight African-American crewmen were promoted in their specialties, the white petty officers were transferred. This made &quot;PC-1264&quot; the only U.S. Navy ship with a completely African-American crew, as USS &quot;Mason&quot; never replaced its white petty officers with African Americans.

===Training incidents===

On 30 April 1944, after four days of intensive drills, &quot;PC-1264&quot; went up the Hudson River to Iona Island to load ammunition for her guns for the first time. After loading, Lt. Purdon expected to moor there for the night, but was not allowed due to the danger from the large amount of ammunition stored there. Looking for a berth for the night, he called the duty office of the nearby U.S. Military Academy at West Point to ask if his ship could tie up at its pier. There was some confusion, as no Navy ship had tied up there in recent history. However, &quot;PC-1264&quot;, with its mostly African-American crew was made welcome, and numerous visitors walked along the dock inspecting her. In addition, the U.S. Army provided two buses, and many of the enlisted crewmen were taken on a tour of the academy under the guidance of knowledgeable sergeants.

Unfortunately for &quot;PC-1264&quot;, a number of other U.S. Navy bases and towns where the ship moored during its tour of duty did not extend the same hospitality as West Point. Especially in the southern United States, &quot;PC-1264&quot;″s crew experienced various degrees of racial intolerance. For example, although most U.S. Navy seamen from nearby training facilities took their swimming tests off a pier at the municipal public beach at Miami Beach, on the day the crew of &quot;PC-1264&quot; was supposed to qualify, the city of Miami Beach refused the use of its public beach for the training of Negroes.

At the Submarine Chaser Training Center in Miami, the civilian guards at the gate often took a long time inspecting the crew&#x27;s ID cards and passes when the men were entering and leaving the base, far longer than the time spent inspecting white seamen. Then one day, this suddenly stopped. It took some time before the officers of &quot;PC-1264&quot; were able to discover why. At a local bar, white seamen of another anti-submarine patrol craft had overheard civilians talking about going down to the base to shoot up the &quot;nigger ship.&quot; These seamen returned to base, armed themselves with rifles and pistols without authorization and went to the gate to wait. When the nervous civilian guards asked what they were doing, the white seamen explained. After that the officers and crew of &quot;PC-1264&quot; noticed that racial harassment at this base decreased significantly.

===Shakedown cruise===

After loading ammunition at Iona Island and leaving West Point, the ship sailed to Fort Lafayette to load depth charges. Then it reported to the United States Naval Frontier Base at Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, which became the &quot;PC-1264&quot;″s home port. This base cared for the escort ships that accompanied convoys to many destinations. Once at Tompkinsville, the ship&#x27;s crew continued training and calibrating their equipment, especially the ship&#x27;s radio direction finder. Besides checking the structural strength of the hull and target practice on the range at Sandy Hook, the ship went through many other tests before going to sea for the first time. Finally, &quot;PC-1264&quot; was ready for its shakedown cruise to the Submarine Chaser Training Center in Miami, Florida.

Upon arrival at Miami, the shakedown inspectors gave the ship and crew a rough going over for several days. However, the crew was jubilant when the ship received a glowing report. Leaving soon after on its first independent cruise, at about 10:35 am the ship encountered engine trouble and was stopped dead in the water far from land. After some delay, a naval tug returned the ship to post after midnight.

On 2 July 1944, the ship&#x27;s shakedown cruise and post-inspection was completed. &quot;PC-1264&quot; was then ordered to a three and a half-days&#x27; exercise at the Fleet Sound School in Key West. However, as far as the Submarine Chaser Training Center was concerned, &quot;PC-1264&quot; was ready. Fifteen members of the crew also received the ship&#x27;s first promotions.

===Escort duty===

After completing Fleet Sound School, &quot;PC-1264&quot; returned to New York and reported for duty on 10 July 1944. She was assigned to Task Unit 02.9, a surface escort group based at the Naval Frontier Base, Staten Island. In the months ahead, &quot;PC-1264&quot; would escort convoys from New York to Cuba or Key West and back again, or from Charleston, South Carolina to New York. She escorted the from New York to Key West so that U.S. air and sea anti-submarine forces would not confuse &quot;Argo&quot; with a German submarine. &quot;PC-1264&quot; would also serve in the role of an &quot;enemy destroyer&quot; to provide submarines with anti-escort training, which also gave additional anti-submarine training to &quot;PC-1264&quot;″s crew.

Its first convoy duty was Convoy NG-448, from New York to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On 21 July sonar indicated a large unidentified object nearby and, acting on standard anti-submarine procedures, &quot;PC-1264&quot; engaged the contact for three hours before leaving to rejoin the convoy, which was now safely out of range. Afterwards, she regularly escorted convoys from New York to Key West and back again.

In September 1944, the engineering section discovered a series of cracks between the engine mounts and bedplates (girders supporting the engines) that were welded to the ship&#x27;s hull. These bedplates distributed the engine&#x27;s weight along the hull. Base engineering confirmed that poor welding during construction was responsible for the cracks. The base engineer also stated that a heavy sea could shift the engines off their supports and sink the ship. As a result, &quot;PC-1264&quot; was relieved from duty and towed to the Navy Yard Annex, at Bayonne, New Jersey. This may have saved the lives of the crew, as the convoy they were preparing to escort later encountered a hurricane with heavy seas. In all probability, &quot;PC-1264&quot; would have been lost.

After the ship was repaired and passed sea trials, &quot;PC-1264&quot; reported again to its Tompkinsville base. It was there, during the first week of November, that the eight white Petty Officers received orders detaching them from &quot;PC-1264&quot;, and their places were taken by eight, newly promoted, black Petty Officers.

===Independent anti-submarine duty===

In early January 1945, as &quot;PC-1264&quot; and other escort ships were sailing with a convoy to Key West, the command vessel received a radio message from Eastern Sea Frontier headquarters detaching three of the ships, including &quot;PC-1264&quot;, and ordering their return to New York. While &quot;PC-1264&quot; would escort one more convoy during the war, her primary mission now was anti-submarine duty. The capture of German spies landed by during November 1944, and the statement by one of the spies that the Germans were preparing to launch V-1 and V-2 rockets by submarines against major U.S. ports, forced the U.S. Navy to respond by increasing its active anti-submarine forces. &quot;PC-1264&quot; was part of that increase and began patrolling areas from Long Island south to Cape Charles, the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay.

On 17 January, &quot;PC-1264&quot; unloaded her ammunition, then proceeded to the Luders Marine Construction Company in Stamford, Connecticut, to have her bottom cleaned and receive a new coat of paint on her underwater hull. She arrived on 18 January and was in drydock for three days. For the next three months, &quot;PC-1264&quot; patrolled a line running north by east for from Buoy &quot;Able,&quot; the farthest seaward buoy marking the mine-swept channel into New York, away. Despite the monotony and the winter weather, the duty was pleasant, as &quot;PC-1264&quot; spent seven days at sea and then five days in port.

On 28 February, while engaged in a practice &quot;anti-submarine&#x27; run against Buoy Able, &quot;PC-1264&quot; may have flushed a German submarine that was using Buoy Able as cover against sonar from patrolling vessels. As the ship neared the end of the practice run against the buoy, the sonar operator reported &quot;Target bearing left rapidly.&quot; Lt. Purdon quickly realized what had probably happened and &quot;PC-1264&quot; actively engaged the target with Mark 22 Antisubmarine Projectiles. This continued for several hours, and, at one point, two crewmen claimed to have seen a submarine conning tower rise briefly then sink back into the turbulence. Eventually the signal disappeared. While Eastern Sea Frontier headquarters believed that the ship had engaged a false signal, the crew always believed that they had flushed &quot;U-866&quot;, a damaged submarine sunk two weeks later off Sable Island, east of Nova Scotia.

On 23 April, &quot;PC-1264&quot; left Tompkinsville on her last patrol. On 25 April, while at sea, the ship received new orders. &quot;PC-1264&quot; was ordered to proceed to Charleston, South Carolina and assume command of the escort ships for Convoy KN-382. Although &quot;PC-1264&quot; had participated in escorting many convoys, this was the first time she was to be in command of the escort group. This was an indication of the confidence Eastern Sea Frontier headquarters now had in &quot;PC-1264&quot;. On 27 April, &quot;PC-1264&quot;, accompanied by &quot;PC-1149&quot; and &quot;PC-1547&quot;, led 30 merchant ships out of Charleston harbor. The convoy was to sail eastward to rendezvous with a smaller convoy heading north from Key West. The next morning, the 30-ship convoy met the northbound convoy of nine merchantmen escorted by three frigates and three subchasers. was in command of this convoy and &quot;PC-1264&quot; reported in, turned over command of the 30 merchantmen, and assumed position on the starboard beam of the joining convoys. With the arrival of the three subchasers from Charleston, two of the smaller subchasers were detached for other duties. The next afternoon, two of the frigates also left.

On 29 April, the convoy encountered &quot;U-879&quot;, which was attacked by USS &quot;Natchez&quot;. The convoy and the other escorts, including &quot;PC-1264&quot;, continued on course with USS &quot;Natchez&quot; to deal with &quot;U-879&quot;. Later that night the convoy encountered Task Group 02.10, a Hunter-Killer Group, which passed down the port side of the convoy on its way assist USS &quot;Natchez&quot;. Two of the destroyer escorts in this group participated in the sinking of &quot;U-879&quot;, one of the last anti-submarine actions of the war in the Atlantic.

===Battle of the Atlantic ends===

Convoy NK-686 started from New York with 28 cargo ships and tankers with &quot;PC-1264&quot; as one of the convoy&#x27;s five escort ships. While the war in Europe had officially ended the day before, the Commander of Eastern Sea Frontier was not taking any chances that individual German submarines might continue the battle. As the convoy headed south toward Key West, 15 ships joined when it passed the Chesapeake Bay, while others left it for the ports of Charleston, Savannah and Jacksonville. Then, on 15 May, Eastern Sea Frontier headquarters was convinced the danger was over, and the merchantmen were dispersed to head for their destinations alone. The escort ships, Task Unit 02.9.10, were ordered to Key West for a week&#x27;s training before returning to New York. On the return trip to Tompkinsville, New York, where Task Unit 02.9.10 arrived on 25 May, the crews&#x27; concern was where they were headed next, as there was still a war in the Pacific.

As &quot;PC-1264&quot; remained in a crowded anchorage filled with numerous other escort vessels, the crew watched as many other submarine chasers had their K-guns, that fired the depth charges, removed and their 20 mm guns replaced by twin-barreled guns of the same caliber. These ships were headed for the Pacific where men-of-war needed heavy anti-aircraft defenses against Japanese suicide planes. Finally the word came down:

From Chief of Naval Operations. To USS PC1264. When in all respects ready for sea, and when directed by Commander Eastern Sea Frontier, you will proceed to Norfolk, Virginia, and report to Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet, for training. Upon completion of refresher training, you will proceed via Canal Zone and report to Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet.

&quot;PC-1264&quot; soon had her K-guns removed from the afterdeck, and on 31 July she left for Norfolk. After an inspection by base personnel, &quot;PC-1264&quot; left for Miami and arrived at the Submarine Chaser Training Center on 5 August. &quot;PC-1264&quot; was due to remain at the center for ten days training, but an incident cut that time short.

One night, at a club that served African Americans, a small fight resulted in the club owner calling the Shore Patrol. When the three white members of the Shore Patrol arrived—a Navy Chief, another enlisted sailor, and an army MP—the chief stayed with the vehicle while the other two entered the club. There, they spotted a black sailor in an officer&#x27;s uniform. Since impersonating an officer is a Federal offense, the MP went over to that man. The man suspected of &quot;impersonating an officer&quot; was actually Ensign Sam Gravely. When the MP told Ensign Gravely that the chief wanted to see him, Gravely replied, &quot;If the Chief wants to see me, tell him to come here.&quot;—following correct naval protocol for an enlisted man to come to an officer. The MP then grabbed Ensign Gravely out of his chair. &quot;Take it easy,&quot; Ensign Gravely shouted to the other men in the club who were visibly upset; then added, &quot;This is only a mistake.&quot; Then to the MP, he said, &quot;Let&#x27;s go.&quot; However, the word spread quickly that Ensign Gravely was being arrested. Black sailors converged on the MP and the Shore Patrol chief radioed for reinforcements. Two more Shore Patrol vehicles with more men soon arrived, to find Ensign Gravely trying to calm the men and explain the mistake to the Shore Patrol. However, Shore Patrol personnel in the two vehicles quickly emerged and forced a number of &quot;PC-1264&quot;″s crew into the trucks. Ensign Gravely got into the chief&#x27;s vehicle, and all proceeded to Shore Patrol Headquarters.

One of &quot;PC-1264&quot;″s crew ran for the ship to tell the captain what had happened. When Lieutenant Purdon arrived at Shore Patrol headquarters he found the Shore Patrol officer on duty apologizing to Ensign Gravely as the Ensign had explained the MP&#x27;s mistake. However, the men who had moved against the Shore Patrol, seeking to defend Ensign Gravely, were charged with &quot;Refusal to Obey Orders of Shore Patrol,&quot; &quot;Interference with Shore Patrol,&quot; two charges of &quot;Drunk and Disorderly,&quot; and one charge of &quot;Drunk.&quot; The next morning at base headquarters, Lieutenant Purdon was informed that the admiral commanding the naval district wanted Lieutenant Purdon to &quot;institute general count martial proceedings against that ensign for &#x27;conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman&#x27;&quot;. Lieutenant Purdon, as the commanding officer of &quot;PC-1264&quot;, refused, citing &quot;Navy Regulations&quot; that a commandant of a naval district could not order a ship&#x27;s captain to bring charges against any officer under that ship captain&#x27;s command. The base adjutant, hearing and understanding the facts behind the incident, advised Lieutenant Purdon to restrict his men to the ship and, therefore, out of reach of the Shore Patrol and the admiral, which Lieutenant Purdon did. &quot;PC-1264&quot; spent four more days in training and left Miami for Key West.

===End of the war===

Key West was as far west as &quot;PC-1264&quot; ever sailed. The day after her arrival, President Truman announced that an atomic bomb had been dropped on Japan. With her orders canceled, &quot;PC-1264&quot; waited at Key West for three weeks. Eventually, the Bureau of Naval Personnel issued plans for demobilization. Lieutenant Purdon requested to be released from active duty and recommended that Lieutenant (jg) Ernest Hardmann, his executive officer, be given command. On 5 September, orders arrived for &quot;PC-1264&quot; to proceed to Norfolk, where Lieutenant Purdon would turn over command to Lt. Hardmann. &quot;PC-1264&quot; arrived at Norfolk on 10 September, and the change of command ceremony took place on 17 September. Before this ceremony, members of the crews already were being released from active duty or transferred to other stations. Also, the crew presented Lieutenant Purdon with a desk lamp with the inscription &quot;USS PC 1264 We Will Never Fail.&quot; Afterwards, the ship stayed at Norfolk for six more weeks, then moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, just up the Elizabeth River.

In early October, &quot;PC-1264&quot; was honored by being selected as one of forty-seven representative warships for a review of the fleet by President Truman on Navy Day, 27 October. On 24 October, she sailed from Norfolk to New York, where the review was to be held. Soon after &quot;PC-1264&quot; left Norfolk, her new commanding officer, Lieutenant (jg) Jack Sutherland, arrived—after traveling there from New York. He was sent back to New York and arrived there soon after his new command. However, he would not take command until after Navy Day. &quot;PC-1264&quot;, as the smallest vessel, was at the tail end of the Fleet review. However, President Truman, on board the destroyer , circled &quot;PC-1264&quot; and waved to the crew.

Both before and after the fleet review, &quot;PC-1264&quot; held &quot;open house&quot; for families and friends of the crew and other interested persons, especially from the African-American community which had great pride in the ship&#x27;s accomplishments. On 31 October, Lieutenant (jg) Sutherland assumed command. On 4 November, the ship sailed for New London, Connecticut, where it spent all of November and half of December assisting in the training of submarine officers, as a target ship for them to practice submarine runs on. On 15 December, &quot;PC-1264&quot; returned to Tompkinsville for Christmas leave. While on leave, Ensign Ben Shanker, the executive officer, received orders to the Pacific and did not return to the ship. When the crew returned, Ensign Sam Gravely was the new executive officer. Soon after, &quot;PC-1264&quot; returned to New London for its submarine training duty. However, &quot;PC-1264&quot; then received orders to return to New York &quot;for disposal.&quot; On 7 February 1946, five officers and twenty-eight enlisted men stood at attention as &quot;PC-1264&quot; was officially decommissioned.

The war records of the submarine chaser &quot;PC-1264&quot; and the destroyer escort USS &quot;Mason&quot; considerably contributed to opening up billets for African Americans in the post-war navy. As a final honor for &quot;PC-1264&quot;, the officer-in-charge of the final inspection party remarked, &quot;This ship has done a better job of decommissioning—is in better shape—than any other ship, at least, here in New York.&quot; Because of her condition, &quot;PC-1264&quot; became the subchaser used as a showcase for prospective civilian purchasers.

==After the war==

After &quot;PC-1264&quot; was decommissioned, she was transferred to the United States Maritime Commission for final disposition. , she was extant—albeit in poor repair—at the former Donjon Marine Yard in New York. Two 1990-era photographs show her heavily rusted, but still afloat amid other hulks.

Like many officers, Lieutenant Purdon left the U.S. Navy after the war but remained in the Naval Reserve. He worked as an intelligence analyst for the Central Intelligence Group until 1948, when he was recalled to active duty. He retired in 1963 with the rank of commander. Eric Purdon then held civilian jobs with the Commerce Department, Office of Economic Opportunity and the Job Corps, and was also an author. He died in 1989.

<doc id="1263827" wikidata="Q334711" url="?curid=1263827" title="Inca Garcilaso de la Vega">
<text>Inca Garcilaso de la Vega (12 April 1539 – 23 April 1616), born Gómez Suárez de Figueroa and known as El Inca, was a chronicler and writer born in the Viceroyalty of Peru. Sailing to Spain at 21, he was educated informally there, where he lived and worked the rest of his life. The natural son of a Spanish conquistador and an Inca noblewoman born in the early years of the conquest, he is known primarily for his chronicles of Inca history, culture, and society. His work was widely read in Europe, influential and well received. It was the first literature by an author born in the Americas to enter the western canon.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1559, Vega moved to Spain in 1561, seeking official acknowledgement as his father&#x27;s son. His paternal uncle became a protector, and he lived in Spain for the rest of his life, where he wrote his histories of the Inca culture and Spanish conquest, as well as an account of De Soto&#x27;s expedition in Florida.

==Early life==

Born Gómez Suárez de Figueroa in Cuzco, Peru, in 1539, he was the natural son of a Spanish conqueror and &quot;encomendero&quot; and a royal Inca mother. He was born during the early years of the Spanish conquest. His father was Spanish captain and &quot;conquistador&quot; Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega y Vargas (d. 1559). His mother was an elite Inca woman, Palla Chimpu Ocllo, who was baptized after the fall of Cuzco as Isabel Suárez Chimpu Ocllo. She was descended from Inca nobility, a daughter of Túpac Huallpa and a granddaughter (not a niece) of the powerful Inca Tupac Yupanqui. Because his parents were not married in the Catholic Church, he was considered illegitimate and the boy was given only his mother&#x27;s surname. Under the Spanish system of caste that developed, he would have been classified as a mestizo (for his mixed parents).

When Gómez was young, his father abandoned his mother and married a much younger Spanish noblewoman, &quot;doña&quot; Luisa Martel, who was only four years older than Gómez. As such, Gómez lived with his mother, her husband Juan de Pedroche, her Inca family and her two daughters, De la Vega&#x27;s half-sisters Ana Ruíz, who went on to marry Martín de Bustinza, and Luisa de Herrera, who married Pedro Márquez de Galeoto (one of their children was Alonso Márquez de Figueroa). His first language was Quechua, but he also learned Spanish from early boyhood. He lived with his mother&#x27;s family for the first ten years of his life before his father took the boy into his household and gave him an education. Garcilaso received an inheritance when his father died in 1559. The next year, at the age of 21, he left Peru for Spain.

==Travel to Spain==
Suárez de Figueroa reached Spain in 1561 while there was still fighting in his native country under the conquest. He may have studied Latin in Seville under the tutelage of Pedro Sánchez de Herrera. The Spanish did not achieve their final victory until 1572. He traveled to Montilla, where he met his father&#x27;s brother, Alonso de Vargas, who acted as the young man&#x27;s protector and helped him make his way. The younger man soon traveled to Madrid to seek official acknowledgement as his father&#x27;s son from the Crown, and he was allowed to take the name of Garcilaso de la Vega. Also referred to as &quot;El Inca&quot; or &quot;Inca Garcilaso de la Vega&quot;, he received an informal education in Spain. Together with his uncle&#x27;s support, gaining his father&#x27;s name helped him integrate into Spanish society.

==Later life==
He remained in Spain and did not return to Peru. As warfare continued in the conquest, he was at political and even physical risk there because of his royal Inca lineage. It is recorded that he died in Córdoba on 23 April 1616, but it could have been up to two days earlier because of the inaccuracy of the existing documents.

==Personal life==
He had at least two sons, born of relationships with different servants. One son was recorded as being born in 1570; he might have died at a very young age. With another servant, Garcilaso had a second son, Diego de Vargas, born in 1590, who helped his father copy the &quot;Royal Commentaries&quot; and survived him until at least 1651.

It is possible that his eldest son was the &#x27;Admiral&#x27; Lope de Vega, who commanded a ship in the fleet of Álvaro de Mendaña, on his 1595 expedition to the Solomon Islands. Lope de Vega was lost at sea when his ship parted from Mendaña&#x27;s fleet in a fog.

==Military service==
De la Vega entered Spanish military service in 1570 and fought in the Alpujarras against the Moors after the Morisco Revolt. He received the rank of captain for his services to the Crown.

==Writings==
He received a first-rate but informal European education in Spain after he moved there at age 21. His works are considered to have great literary value and are not simple historical chronicles. He wrote from an important perspective, as his maternal family were the ruling Inca. He portrays the Inca as benevolent rulers who governed a country where everybody was well-fed and happy before the Spanish came. Having learned first-hand about daily Inca life from his maternal relatives, he was able to convey that in his writings. As an adult, he also gained the perspective to describe accurately the political system of tribute and labor enforced by the Incas from the subsidiary tribes in their empire.

Baptized and reared as Roman Catholic, he portrayed Incan religion and the expansion of its empire from a viewpoint influenced by his upbringing. He did not acknowledge or discuss the human sacrifices that are now known to have been part of Inca practice. It is unknown whether that was an effort to portray his Inca ancestors in a more positive light to a Spanish audience or his ignorance of the practice having lived most of his life in Spain.

===&quot;Historia de la Florida&quot;===
De la Vega&#x27;s first work was &quot;La Florida del Inca&quot;, an account of Hernando de Soto&#x27;s expedition and journey in Florida. The work was published in Lisbon in 1605 and became popular. It describes the expedition according to its own records and information Garcilaso gathered during the years. He defended the legitimacy of imposing the Spanish sovereignty in conquered territories and submitting them to Catholic jurisdiction. At the same time, he expresses and defends the dignity, the courage, and the rationality of the Native Americans. It was translated and published in English in 1951.

Historians have identified problems with using &quot;La Florida&quot; as an historical account. Jerald T. Milanich and Charles M. Hudson warn against relying on Garcilaso, noting serious problems with the sequence of events and location of towns in his narrative. They say that &quot;some historians regard Garcilaso&#x27;s &quot;La Florida&quot; to be more a work of literature than a work of history.&quot; Lankford characterizes Garcilaso&#x27;s &quot;La Florida&quot; as a collection of &quot;legend narratives,&quot; derived from a much-retold oral tradition of the survivors of the expedition.

===&quot;Comentarios Reales de los Incas&quot;===
While in Spain, Garcilaso wrote his best-known work, &quot;Comentarios Reales de los Incas&quot;, published in Lisbon in 1609. It was based mostly on stories and oral histories told him by his Inca relatives when he was a child in Cusco, but also on the remnants of the history by Blas Valera which was mostly destroyed in the sacking of Cadiz in 1596. The &quot;Comentarios&quot; have two sections and volumes. The first was primarily about Inca life. The second, about the conquest of Peru, was published in 1617. It was first published in English in London in 1685, translated by Sir Paul Rycaut and titled &quot;The Royal Commentaries of Peru.&quot; 
More than a century and a half after its initial publication, in the 1780s, as the uprising against colonial oppression led by Tupac Amaru II was gaining momentum, Charles III of Spain banned the &quot;Comentarios&quot; from being published in the Quechua language in Lima or distributed there on account of its &quot;dangerous&quot; content.

The book was not printed again in the Americas until 1918, but copies continued to be circulated secretly. It was translated and printed in English in 1961 in the United States as &quot;The Incas,&quot; and in another edition in 1965 as &quot;Royal Commentaries of the Incas&quot;. (See below)

==Honors==
*Cusco&#x27;s main stadium, Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega, is named after him.
*In 1965, Inca Garcilaso de la Vega University, in Lima, Peru, was named in his honor.
* In Rome, Italy, near Villa Borghese, there is a statue dedicated to Inca Garcilaso de la Vega which was erected in 1967. A similar statue, dated 1973, stands in the Plaza República del Perú in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

<doc id="1263832" wikidata="Q2662600" url="?curid=1263832" title="Federico Domínguez (footballer, born 1976)">
<text>Federico Hernán Domínguez (born 13 August 1976 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is an Argentine former footballer who last played for the Uruguayan side Montevideo Wanderers.

== Career==
Domínguez began his professional career with Vélez Sarsfield, where he won the Copa Libertadores in 1994. He played the 1998/1999 season with Spanish Espanyol, but returned to Vélez to play until 2002. That year he moved to Independiente.

Domínguez joined Mexican Santos Laguna after playing the first half of the 2003/2004 season with Spanish Second Division Leganés. Joining Santos for the 2004 Clausura, Domínguez immediately became an important player, starting 15 of 19 games for the club and scoring one goal. He repeated his performance in the Apertura of that year, appearing in 13 games and scoring twice.

Between 2004 and 2007 Domínguez played for River Plate and he played for Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata between 2007 and 2008.

In 2008, he joined Cypriot side Apollon Limassol, where he played 3 matches before leaving citing personal reasons. He returned to South America to join Nacional of Uruguay.

In 2009, he was signed by new Argentinos Juniors manager Claudio Borghi and became an important member of the Argentinos Juniors team that won the Clausura 2010 championship. He played in 15 of the club&#x27;s 19 games during their championship winning campaign and was one of the few players in the team to have any previous championship winning experience.

<doc id="1263835" wikidata="Q4849080" url="?curid=1263835" title="Baker's Supermarkets">
<text>Baker&#x27;s is a supermarket chain operating primarily in the metro area of Omaha, Nebraska. It is owned by Kroger. Baker&#x27;s supermarket has an annual revenue of $325,000,000.

== History ==
Abraham Baker opened his first grocery store in Walnut, Iowa in 1927. His first Omaha-area store opened in Bellevue, Nebraska in 1947, and his first in Omaha itself at 73rd and Maple Streets opened in 1957.

In 1971, Abraham&#x27;s two sons, Jack and Bob, took on more management responsibility. In 1972, The Jewel Companies, Inc. made a deal with Baker&#x27;s to open a Turn Style/Baker&#x27;s Family Center in Omaha. As revenues began to decline, The Baker family sold the chain to food wholesaler Fleming Companies, Inc in 1992. The Kroger Company purchased the Baker&#x27;s stores from Fleming in 2001 (after winning a bidding war with Albertsons), after Fleming ran into financial problems.

In 2004, three former Albertsons supermarkets in Omaha were purchased and turned into Baker&#x27;s stores after Albertsons withdrew from the Omaha market. Baker&#x27;s today is run under the Dillons division, which includes Baker&#x27;s, Dillons, and Gerbes.

<text>CBLFT-DT (channel 25) is an Ici Radio-Canada Télé station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which broadcasts programming to the province&#x27;s Franco-Ontarian population. It is part of a twinstick with CBC Television flagship CBLT-DT (channel 5). The two stations share studios at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre on Front Street West in downtown Toronto; CBLFT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located atop the CN Tower.

The station provides French-language programming to the Greater Toronto Area and most of Ontario, including the Southwestern, Central and Northeastern regions of the province.

==History==
CBLFT was originally licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in 1972 as a standalone station; the station first signed on the air on March 23, 1973. Until CBLFT signed on, CBC O&amp;O CBLT aired French-language programming from Radio-Canada on Sunday mornings. The station originally transmitted from the CBC&#x27;s Jarvis Street transmitter site, but as with almost all other radio and television stations in Toronto, approval was given by the CRTC to move the transmitter site to the CN Tower on December 14, 1973. Several transmitters in Northern Ontario which were already in operation as rebroadcasters of CBOFT in Ottawa were reassigned to CBLFT&#x27;s license, and various additional rebroadcasters were added throughout Ontario in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the early 1990s due to budget cutbacks at the CBC, all Radio-Canada transmitters in Ontario (except those in the northwest part of the province, which was served by CBWFT in Winnipeg) were reassigned to the license of CBOFT as rebroadcasters. All of the transmitters that were formerly part of CBLFT&#x27;s license continued to broadcast a separate local early evening newscast, which was produced in Ottawa, but was only seen in that city via a late night rebroadcast, similar to the split broadcast used at CBC Radio One station CBLA-FM (99.1 FM) for its morning programs.

On April 28, 2010, the CRTC granted a license request by the CBC to relaunch CBLFT as a separate station which would once again produce a distinct local newscast from CBOFT. Most of the network&#x27;s transmitters in Ontario, except for those in the Ottawa area, were again reassigned to CBLFT&#x27;s license, and newscast production later returned to Toronto.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CBLFT shut down its analogue signal, over UHF channel 25, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 24 to post-transition (and former analogue) channel 25.

Transmitters in mandatory markets were required to switch to digital or shut down by the transition deadline of August 31, 2011. Radio-Canada requested to temporarily broadcast in analogue in these markets beyond 2011, as programming for Radio-Canada is not produced in these markets. The following CBLFT rebroadcasters are in mandatory markets:
* CBLFT-8 Kitchener
* CBLFT-9 London
* CBLFT-18 Thunder Bay
* CBEFT Windsor

However, on August 16, 2011, the CRTC granted the CBC permission to continue operating 22 repeaters in mandatory markets, including the above, in analogue until August 31, 2012, in which by then they must either convert to digital or close down. This was pending the corporation&#x27;s licence renewal process, which will include an evaluation of its transition plans.

At some point before June 20, 2012, CBLFT had begun airing a Mobile DTV simulcast of CBLT-DT on virtual channel 5.2, encoded in the H.264 and HE-AAC formats.

===Transmitters===

CBLFT operated almost 30 analog television rebroadcasters throughout the province of Ontario and included communities such as London, Kitchener and Sudbury. Additionally, several Radio-Canada transmitters in eastern Ontario, such as Kingston and Belleville, were part of the CBLFT license even though they served cities that were closer to Ottawa than Toronto.

Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analog transmitters on July 31, 2012. (A transmitter serving Barrie, CBLFT-11, closed down the previous year, in August 2011.) None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s television rebroadcasters were converted to digital, leaving rural Canadians and U.S. border regions with no free over-the-air CBC/Radio-Canada coverage. Some affected viewers could get the signal back for a price by subscribing to cable or satellite.

CBLFT is not carried on cable or satellite in the United States.

In many communities, TVOntario transmitted from Radio-Canada sites and therefore permanently left the air the same day. Former rebroadcast transmitters, all now defunct, included:
On December 17, 1985, the CRTC approved the CBC&#x27;s application to add a transmitter at Thorne/Eldee on channel 16 with 13 watts to rebroadcast the programs of CBLFT Toronto, through CBLFT-1 (channel 7) Sturgeon Falls. Its unknown if the transmitter at Thorne/Eldee was ever launched.

<text>Rubén Angel Sierra García (born October 6, 1965) is a Puerto Rican former Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder. Over 20 seasons, Sierra played for the Texas Rangers (1986–92, 2000–01, 2003), Oakland Athletics (1992–95), New York Yankees (1995–96, 2003–05), Detroit Tigers (1996), Cincinnati Reds (1997), Toronto Blue Jays (1997), Chicago White Sox (1998), Seattle Mariners (2002) and Minnesota Twins (2006). Sierra also signed with the Cleveland Indians at the end of 1999, but was released towards the end of spring training in March 2000. During his playing career, Sierra was known as &#x27;El Indio&#x27; or &#x27;El Caballo&#x27; (The Horse).

==Early life==
Sierra graduated from Liceo Interamericano Castro High School in Puerto Rico in 1983, where he played baseball, basketball and volleyball.

==MLB career==
In November 1982, the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball (MLB) signed 17-year-old Sierra as a free agent. Sierra made his major league debut on June 1, 1986, as an outfielder and hit a home run in his second MLB at bat. Sierra hit .264 with 16 home runs and 55 runs batted in (RBIs) in his rookie year.

In 1989, Sierra hit 29 home runs and led the league in RBIs (119), triples (14), slugging percentage (.543), total bases (344) and extra base hits (78), and finished second in MVP voting to Robin Yount. He had three seasons with over 100 RBIs with the Rangers. In August 1992, the Rangers traded Sierra, Jeff Russell, and Bobby Witt to the Oakland Athletics for José Canseco.

In 1995, the Athletics traded Sierra and Jason Beverlin to the New York Yankees for Danny Tartabull. After helping the Yankees reach the playoffs for the first time in 14 years in 1995, Sierra was traded to the Detroit Tigers with Matt Drews for Cecil Fielder. After the 1997 season, the Tigers traded Sierra to the Cincinnati Reds for minor leaguers Decomba Conner and Ben Bailey.

Sierra won the AL Comeback Player of the Year Award with the Rangers in 2001. He played for the Mariners in 2002 and began the 2003 season with the Rangers. On June 6, 2003, the Rangers traded Sierra to the Yankees for Marcus Thames. Sierra was an important part of the 2004 Yankees, a team that hit over 240 home runs, hitting 17 of them as the usual designated hitter, playing in 56 games at the position.

In Game 4 of the 2004 American League Division Series, with the Yankees down to the Minnesota Twins 5–2, Sierra hit a three-run home run to tie the game at 5–5 off of reliever Juan Rincón. His clutch home run helped the Yankees rally to win the game and the series. However, he was the final out of Game 7 of the 2004 American League Championship Series, hitting a ground ball to Pokey Reese, which secured the dramatic comeback victory of the Boston Red Sox. Sierra had an injury-plagued 2005 season and was let go by the Yankees after hitting just 4 home runs in 61 games. In 2006, Sierra signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins, but was released on July 10. In August, Sierra was offered a chance to sign on with the New York Mets for the September run and playoffs. However, due to an illness to his mother, he opted not to play again in 2006.

In January 2007, Sierra signed a minor league contract with the Mets, who invited him to spring training. However, on March 20, he requested and was granted his release by the team after being reassigned the previous Thursday.

<text>CBOFT-DT (channel 9) is an Ici Radio-Canada Télé station in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, serving the National Capital Region. It is part of a twinstick with CBC Television station CBOT-DT (channel 4). The two stations share studios at the CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre on Queen Street (across from the Confederation Line light rail station) in Downtown Ottawa, alongside the main corporate offices of the CBC; CBOFT-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located on the Ryan Tower at Camp Fortune in Chelsea, Quebec, north of Gatineau.

==History==
CBOFT first signed on the air on June 24, 1955, as the first French-language television station in Ontario. Previously, CBOT aired both CBC and Radio-Canada programs.

For a brief time during 1977 and 1978, until CHOT opened, CBOFT also carried some TVA programs, after Ottawa&#x27;s first TVA affiliate, CFVO-TV (whose channel 30 frequency is now occupied by CIVO) went bankrupt.

Due to cost-cutting measures at the CBC in the early 1990s, local programming on Toronto&#x27;s CBLFT and its rebroadcasters, as well as CBLFT semi-satellite CBEFT in Windsor was discontinued in 1991. All Radio-Canada transmitters in Ontario (except the northwest, which was served by CBWFT in Winnipeg) were reclassified as rebroadcasters of CBOFT, under the name &quot;. The station produced two distinct newscasts through the 1990s and 2000s, one for the Ottawa region and one for the remainder of Ontario.

In 2010, the CBC applied to the CRTC to have CBLFT relicensed as a separate station, which would again produce a separate newscast for broadcast in most of the province outside of CBOFT&#x27;s market. The application was approved on April 28, 2010, leading to CBLFT resuming newscast production from Toronto, and most of the network&#x27;s transmitters in Ontario were reassigned to CBLFT&#x27;s license. Following this split in the network, CBOFT and its Quebec transmitters became &quot;, while most other Ontario transmitters became &quot;&quot;.

Prior to the arrival of the Ottawa Senators NHL team, the station would broadcast the Montreal Canadiens games on Saturday nights, while the English counterpart, CBOT, would carry the Toronto Maple Leafs games during the Saturday &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; slot.

===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from UHF channel 22 to VHF channel 9. Due to reception issues on channel 9, the station was granted permission to move to UHF channel 33.

===Transmitters/Former rebroadcasters of CBOFT===

CBOFT operated three analog television rebroadcasters all located in Quebec in the following communities:

Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC&#x27;s and Radio-Canada&#x27;s remaining analog transmitters on July 31, 2012. None of CBC or Radio-Canada&#x27;s rebroadcasters were converted to digital.

<text>The term Harbin Russians or Russian Harbinites (, ) refers to several generations of Russians who lived in the city of Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. Russian settlers were responsible for turning Harbin into a Russian city with the majority of the population being from Russian ethnic groups, from approximately 1898 to the mid-1960s. Harbin, a major junction city on the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), came successively under the control of the Qing dynasty, under Russia&#x27;s sphere of influence, the Republic of China, Japanese puppet state Manchukuo and the People&#x27;s Republic of China in this period.

The people in the Soviet Union used the terms &quot;KVZhDist&quot; (, &quot;person of the China Eastern Railway&quot; ) and &quot;Harbinets&quot; (Харбинец, &quot;Harbinite/person from Harbin&quot;) to refer to a person with any type of ties to the China Eastern Railway.

== History ==
=== Settlement ===
The first generation of Harbin Russians were mostly the builders and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway. They moved to Harbin in order to work on the railroad. At the time Harbin was not an established city. The city was built almost entirely from scratch by the builders and early settlers. Houses were constructed, furniture and personal items were brought in from Russia. After the Russo-Japanese War, while many Russians left Harbin, a lot of long-time residents decided to stay. By 1913, Harbin had become an established Russian colony for the construction and maintenance work on the China Eastern Railway. A record shows Harbin had a total of 68,549 people, most of Russian and Chinese descent. There were a total of 53 different nationalities. Along with Russian and Chinese, there were 45 spoken languages used in Harbin at the time. Only 11.5% of all residents were born in Harbin. There were also lively religious activities, by the Russians (Saint Sophia Cathedral in Harbin), Ukrainians (Church of the Intercession in Harbin), Poles (Sacred Heart Cathedral of Harbin), Germans (Harbin Nangang Christian Church), Danish (Danish Lutheran Church), Russian &quot;Molokane&quot;, and others.
A few kilometers from Harbin, around the railway station of Asheng (Ashihé), there was, until 1955, a settlement of hundreds of White Russians. A large community, it had an orthodox church, independent college, library and social club. The common language was Russian, with some Siberian variations. Many Czarist Imperial officers amongst &quot;old believers&quot; contributed to maintain strong links to Russian culture, literature and music. Almost the entire population of Asheng emigrated to Australia and Brazil.

=== World War I and the Russian Revolution ===
In the decade from 1913 to 1923, Russia went through World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the Russian Civil War. In the 1920s Harbin was flooded with 100,000 to 200,000 White émigrés fleeing from Russia. They were mostly officers and soldiers involved in the White movement, members of the White governments in Siberia and Russian Far East. There were both the &quot;intelligentsia&quot; and ordinary people. While many fleeing the Russian Revolution and Civil War stayed in Harbin, large numbers merely used Harbin as a way point to other destinations across the Pacific. Harbin held the largest Russian population outside of the state of Russia.

=== Under Chinese control ===

On September 8, 1920, the Republic of China announced that it would no longer recognize the Russian consulates in China. On September 23, China ceased relations with representatives of the Russian Empire and deprived Russians of extraterritorial rights. Overnight, Russians in China found themselves stateless. Shortly afterward, the Chinese government took over control of institutions in Harbin such as courts, police, prison, post office, and some research and educational institutions.
In 1924, an agreement was signed in Beijing regarding the control of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The agreement stated that only Soviet and Chinese citizens could be employed by the CER. This meant the Harbin Russians had to choose not only their nationality, but also their political identity. Many Harbin Russians took Soviet citizenship for patriotic reasons or a genuine support for communism. However, there were also Harbin Russians who remained stateless who were eventually let go from CER. Gradually, the national and the political identity of the Harbin Russians split the group into opposing sides. This eventually led to a strongly pro-Soviet sentiment in Harbin.

In 1929, the Congregation of Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception opened the Lyceum St. Nicholas, which educated the Christian male elite until 1949.

=== Japanese occupation ===

In the 1930s, the Japanese occupied Manchuria, and turned it into the puppet state of Manchukuo. In 1935, the Soviet Union sold its share of the China Eastern Railway to Japan via Manchukuo. In the spring and summer of 1935, thousands of Harbin Russians went on trains with their passports and belongings, and left for the Soviet Union.

Many Harbin Russians returned to the Soviet Union after 1935. After the return most of them were arrested, accused of anti-Soviet activities and a large number of them were executed.
Some Harbin Russians moved to other cities, such as Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao, and eventually left China. By the 1930s, Shanghai&#x27;s Russian community had grown to 25,000.

The anti-Communist Harbin Russians formed the Russian Fascist Party (RFP). The RFP was anti-semitic and harassed the Jewish Harbin Russians with, among other things, kidnappings, and many Russian Jews therefore left Harbin. In 1934, the Japanese formed the , (BREM} who were nominally under the control of RFP; the BREM provided identification papers necessary to live, work and travel in Manchukuo. White General Vladimir Kislitsin acted as BREM&#x27;s chairman between 1938 and 1942. Ataman Grigory Semyonov, himself much in favor with the Japanese, replaced him from 1943 to 1945.
The Harbin Russians were left to choose between a Soviet citizenship or to remain stateless by support of the BREM. The stateless Russians were officially favored by the regime, but in reality, they were not trusted and exposed to a great risk of being arrested as spies for the Soviet Union. They were also often enlisted in the army for work along the border to the Soviet Union. After the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 they were in an even more sensitive situation. To separate the anti-Soviet Russians from the Soviet Russians, the former were ordered to wear a badge with the colors of the Czar — later, a white numbered disk of aluminum.

The Soviet Russians were excluded from the Russian schools and their property was often confiscated, but they were under the protection of the Soviet Embassy.

=== After World War II ===

In 1945, after the Soviet Army occupied Harbin, the Soviets held a series of trials for all the Harbin Russians they identified as White Guardists and those who had collaborated with the Japanese authorities; many were sentenced to labour camps. 

In 1949, following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China—some Harbin Russians migrated to Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia.

After 1952, the Soviet Union initiated a second wave of repatriation of Harbin Russians. By the mid-1960s virtually all Harbin Russians had left Harbin, most of them immigrating to the USSR. There were several Russian connections in Australia resulting from refugees leaving Harbin. A good portion of the Russian Old Believers went to South America.

<doc id="1263926" wikidata="Q571986" url="?curid=1263926" title="Piasecki X-49 SpeedHawk">
<text>The Piasecki X-49 &quot;SpeedHawk&quot; is an American four-bladed, twin-engined experimental high-speed compound helicopter developed by Piasecki Aircraft. The X-49A is based on the airframe of a Sikorsky YSH-60F Seahawk, but utilizes Piasecki&#x27;s proprietary vectored thrust ducted propeller (VTDP) design and includes the addition of lifting wings. The concept of the experimental program was to apply the VTDP technology to a production military helicopter to determine any benefit gained through increases in performance or useful load.

&quot;SpeedHawk&quot; is a concept aircraft based on applying X-49A compounding concepts to a production UH-60 Black Hawk offering better performance, range, and increases in useful load. The &quot;SpeedHawk&quot; aircraft includes an SPU (third engine), high forward-swept wing concept, a 45-inch &quot;fuselage plug&quot; cabin extension, and several other drag reducing and performance-oriented improvements, including a rotor hub fairing, landing gear streamlining, and a fly-by-wire flight control system.

==Development==
The U.S. Navy-sponsored project, worth US$26.1 million when announced in 2003 ($ million today), consisted of a Sikorsky YSH-60F helicopter modified by Piasecki as a testbed to validate the &quot;Vectored Thrust Ducted Propeller&quot; (VTDP) system. One YSH-60F, powered by two General Electric T700-GE-701C engines, was converted to test the feasibility of VTDP.

The demonstration contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command to Piasecki Aircraft. In addition to the VTDP, Piasecki installed a lifting wing with flaperons on the YSH-60F.

The compound helicopter technology installed by Piasecki had been first demonstrated in trials of the Piasecki 16H-1 and 16H-1A “Pathfinder” in the early 1960s, when the helicopters were flown at speeds up to 225 mph (360 km/h). The success of the Pathfinder inspired others to experiment with compounding, resulting in programs such as the AH-56 Cheyenne.

In May 2003, the YSH-60F/VTDP demonstrator was redesignated the &quot;X-49A&quot;. During 2004, the X-49A VTDP program was transitioned from the U.S. Navy to the U.S. Army.

In 2013, it was reported that Piasecki Aviation had made plans to use the VTDP design of the X-49 for their entry in the Future Vertical Lift program, but were not chosen when that project moved into its Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD) phase.

==Design==
The X-49A flight demonstrator was developed with funding from the U.S. Army&#x27;s Aviation Applied Technology Directorate to demonstrate the ability to increase the speed of existing helicopters to 200 kt (360 km/h) or more. The flight demonstrator was updated with a lifting wing taken from an Aerostar FJ-100 business jet. A ring tail was added and the helicopter drive train modified to accommodate VTDP. Piasecki conducted integrated tests of the modified drivetrain at the Navy&#x27;s helicopter transmission test facility. The wings were intended to produce lift to offload the rotor so the rotor could be slowed and produce less drag, allowing for higher speed.

The cockpit controls were modified with the addition of a manual propeller pitch override on the collective lever for the ring tail. This is the only visible change to the aircraft&#x27;s existing mechanical controls in the cockpit. The other controls needed to operate the compound helicopter&#x27;s systems were integrated into the aircraft&#x27;s existing mechanical controls to reduce pilot workload. The weight added to the X-49A demonstrator aircraft is estimated at due to the requirement to not modify the existing mechanical control system.

==Operational history==
The X-49A made its first flight on June 29, 2007 for 15 minutes at Boeing&#x27;s New Castle County (KILG) flight test center. This flight included hovering, pedal turns, and slow forward and sideways flight using the VTDP for anti-torque, directional and trim control. The X-49A project has been silent since completing its initial testing phase in 2008, with over 80 flight events and more than 80 total hours logged.

<doc id="1263929" wikidata="Q1377716" url="?curid=1263929" title="Belgians">
<text>Belgians ( ; ; ) are people identified with the Kingdom of Belgium, a federal state in Western Europe. As Belgium is a multinational state, this connection may be residential, legal, historical, or cultural rather than ethnic. The majority of Belgians, however, belong to two distinct linguistic groups or &quot;communities&quot; (; ) native to the country, i.e. its historical regions: Flemings in Flanders, who speak Dutch, West Flemish and Limburgish; and Walloons in Wallonia, who speak French or Walloon. There is also a substantial Belgian diaspora, which has settled primarily in the United States, Canada, France, and the Netherlands.

==Etymology==
The 1830 revolution led to the establishment of an independent country under a provisional government and a national congress. The name &quot;Belgium&quot; was adopted for the country, the word being derived from &quot;Gallia Belgica&quot;, a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul that, before Roman invasion in 100 BC, was inhabited by the &quot;Belgae&quot;, a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples.

The Latin name was revived in 1790 by the short-lived United Belgian States which was created after a revolution against Austrian rule took place in 1789. Since no adjective equivalent to &quot;Belgian&quot; existed at the time, the French noun &quot;Belgique&quot; (or &quot;Belgium&quot;) was adopted as both noun and adjective; a phenomenon borrowed from Latin which was still commonly used during the period. From the sixteenth century, the Low Countries&quot; or &quot;Netherlands&quot;, were referred to as &#x27;Belgica&#x27; in Latin, as was the Dutch Republic.

==Relations between Belgian linguistic communities==
Belgians are primarily a nationality or citizen group, by &quot;jus soli&quot; (Latin: right of the soil), also known as birthright citizenship, and are not a homogeneous ethnic group. Belgians are made up of two main linguistic and ethnic groups; the Dutch-speakers (called the Flemish) and the French-speakers (mostly Walloons), as well as a third tiny but constitutionally recognized group from two small German-speaking areas. These sometimes competing ethnic and linguistic priorities are governed by constitutionally designated &quot;regions or communities&quot;, depending on the constitutional realm of the topic, a complex and uniquely Belgian political construct. Since many Belgians are at least bilingual, or even trilingual, it is common for business, social and family networks to include members of the various ethnic groups composing Belgium.

The Brussels-Capital Region occupies a unique political and cultural position since geographically and linguistically it is a bilingual enclave within the unilingual Flemish Region. Since the founding of the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830, the city of Brussels was francized, as it was transformed from an almost entirely Dutch-speaking into a multilingual city with French as the majority language and &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

Since the independence of Belgium in 1830, the constitutional title of the Belgian head of state is the &quot;King of the Belgians&quot; rather than the &quot;King of Belgium&quot;.

===Flemish (Dutch-speaking)===
Within Belgium the Flemish, about 60% of the population, form a clearly distinguishable group, set apart by their language and customs. However, when compared to the Netherlands most of these cultural and linguistic boundaries quickly fade, as the Flemish share the same language, similar or identical customs and (though only with the southern part of today&#x27;s Netherlands) traditional religion with the Dutch.

However, the popular perception of being a single polity varies greatly, depending on subject matter, locality and personal background. Generally, Flemings will seldom identify themselves as being Dutch and vice versa, especially on a national level.

===Walloon (French-speaking)===


Walloons are a French-speaking people who live in Belgium, principally in Wallonia. Walloons are a distinctive community within Belgium, important historical and anthropological criteria (religion, language, traditions, folklore) bind Walloons to the French people. More generally, the term also refers to the inhabitants of the Walloon Region. They may speak regional languages such as &quot;Walloon&quot; (with &quot;Picard&quot; in the West and &quot;Gaumais&quot; in the South).

Though roughly three-quarters of Belgium&#x27;s French speakers live in Wallonia, French-speaking residents of Brussels tend not to identify as Walloons.

===German-speaking community===

The German-speaking Community of Belgium is one of the three constitutionally recognized federal communities of Belgium. Covering an area of less than 1,000 km2 within the province of Liège in Wallonia, it includes nine of the eleven municipalities of the so-called East Cantons and the local population numbers over 73,000 – less than 1% of the national total. Bordering the Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg, the area has its own parliament and government at Eupen.

The German-speaking community is composed of the German-speaking parts of the lands that were annexed in 1920 from Germany. In addition, in contemporary Belgium there are also some other German-speaking areas that belonged to Belgium even before 1920, but they are not currently considered officially part of the German-speaking community in Belgium: Bleiberg-Welkenraat-Baelen in Northeastern province of Liège and Arelerland (city of Arlon and some of its nearby villages in Southeastern province of Belgian Luxembourg). However, in these localities, the German language is highly endangered due to the adoption of French.

==Religion==

Roman Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium&#x27;s majority religion, with approximately 65% of the Belgians declaring themselves to be Catholics. However, by 2004, nationwide Sunday church attendance was only about 4 to 8% (9% for Flanders only). A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, long considered more religious than the Brussels or Wallonia regions in Belgium, showed 55% of its inhabitants calling themselves religious, while 36% said that they believed that God created the world.

==Demographics==
Belgium had a population of 10,839,905 people on 1 January 2010, an increase of 601,000 in comparison to 2000 (10,239,085 inhabitants). Between 1990 (9,947,782 inhabitants) and 2000 the increase was only 291,000. The population of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels on 1 January 2010 was 6,251,983 (57.7%), 3,498,384 (32.3%) and 1,089,538 (10.1%), respectively.

<doc id="1263934" wikidata="Q744967" url="?curid=1263934" title="Submarine chaser">
<text>A submarine chaser or subchaser is a type of small naval vessel that is specifically intended for anti-submarine warfare. They encompass designs that are now largely obsolete, but which played an important role in the wars of the first half of the 20th century. Many of the American submarine chasers used in World War I found their way to Allied nations by way of Lend-Lease in World War II.

==Submarine chaser variants==
U.S. Navy submarine chasers were designed specifically to destroy German submarines in World War I, and Japanese and German submarines in World War II. The small SC-1-class submarine chasers of the design used in World War I carried the hull designator SC (for Submarine Chaser). Their main weapon was the depth charge. They also carried machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. The similar-sized SC-497-class was built for World War II. Also in World War II, larger PC-461-class submarine chasers used the PC hull classification symbol (for Patrol, Coastal).

Class relationships:

* 438 (98t, wooden hull)
* 343 (450t, steel hull)
* 68 (850t, steel hull)
** used in similar role as the submarine chasers
* 123 
** design basis for the &quot;PCE-842&quot; class
**equipped with substantial anti-submarine capabilities and used as escorts
*95 (890t, steel hull)
**predecessor design to the &quot;Admirable&quot; class
*481 (270t, wooden hull)

In early 1915, the British Admiralty selected the US Electric Launch Company (Elco) for the production of 50 motor launches for anti-submarine work, British industry being at maximum capacity. This order was eventually increased by a further 530. The whole order was completed by November 1916, and the vessels entered Royal Navy service. The vessels were in length and capable of . They were armed with a 3-pounder gun, towed paravanes to attack submarines and, later, depth charges. Additional motor launches of the Fairmile A, Fairmile B and other classes were built for World War II.

===War service===
The British sub chasers were operated around the coast in defence. However, they were uncomfortable, wet and not suited to British sea conditions. Although used during the First World War, they were sold when the war ended.

Submarine chasers were used mostly by the United States Coast Guard in World War II for destroying German U-boats that were stationed off the coast of the United States that were trying to sink merchant convoys as they departed American ports. In the Pacific Theatre, submarine chasers were used for amphibious landings, courier and escort duty.

Eight British Fairmile B motor launches were transferred from Canada to the US in World War II, and included the SC-1466 class of sub-chasers.

The Imperial Japanese Navy had around 250 submarine chasers in World War II, principally about 200 of the No.1-class auxiliary submarine chasers. Some of these survived to serve in the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force (JMSDF) after the war.

During Project Hula, the United States secretly transferred 32 U.S. Navy submarine chasers to the Soviet Union between 26 May and 2 September 1945, and some of these saw action in the Soviet Navy during Soviet military operations against the Japanese between 9 August and 2 September 1945. The transfer of 24 more was canceled when transfers halted on 5 September 1945, three days after the Japanese surrender. Between 1954 and 1960 all 32 transferred submarine chasers were scrapped by the Soviet Union or destroyed off its coast by mutual agreement between the two countries.

===Post-war===
In the decade immediately after World War II, the Soviet Union built 227 Kronshtadt-class submarine chasers, some of which remained in active service until the 1990s. Rapid developments in submarine technologies since World War II mean that submarine chasers are now obsolete, having been replaced by corvettes, frigates, and destroyers.

===Survivors===
The only remaining submarine chaser with intact World War II armament is the Royal Norwegian Navy&#x27;s HNoMS &quot;Hitra&quot;, which is a touring museum today. A World War II type submarine chaser built in 1953, originally &quot;PC1610&quot;, is being restored in the Netherlands as &quot;Le Fougueux&quot;.

<doc id="1263943" wikidata="Q979049" url="?curid=1263943" title="Erythema marginatum">
<text>Erythema marginatum (also known as chicken wire erythema) is an acquired skin condition which primarily affects the arms, trunk, and legs. It is a type of erythema (redness of the skin or mucous membranes) characterised by bright pink or red circular lesions which have sharply-defined borders and faint central clearing. The lesions typically range from 3 to 10 cm in size, and are distributed symmetrically over the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs and extensor surfaces. The lesions last between one and four weeks but have been known to be present on patients for as long as several months. 

The condition was first reported in 1816 by Jean Cruveilhier and is thought to be linked to other skin conditions such as urticaria and systemic lupus erythematosus.

An association with bradykinin has been proposed in the case of hereditary angioedema.

==Presentation==
The rings are barely raised and are non-itchy. The face is generally spared.

The condition is characterised by circular, non-pruritic, erythematous rashes which form on the trunk and extremities of the body. The rash has a known serpiginous edge, and often appears and disappears spontaneously over time. Histological examination of the rash identifies infiltration of mononuclear cells and neutrophils in the papillary and upper half of the reticular dermis layer.

===Associated conditions===
It occurs in less than 10% of patients with acute rheumatic fever (ARF), but is considered a major Jones criterion when it does occur. The four other major criteria include carditis, polyarthritis, Sydenham&#x27;s chorea, and subcutaneous nodules. In this case, it is often associated with Group A streptococcal infection, otherwise known as &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; infection, which can be detected with an ASO titer.

It is an early feature of acute rheumatic fever though not pathognomonic of it. It some cases it may be associated with mild myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle). 

The condition is also seen as a precursor to or accompany an attack of angioedema, and is seen in conditions like allergic drug reactions, sepsis and glomerulonephritis.

It often occurs as a harbinger of attacks in hereditary angioedema. In this case it may occur several hours or up to a day before an attack.

==Diagnosis==
===Types===
Some sources distinguish between the following:
* &quot;Erythema marginatum rheumaticum&quot;
* &quot;Erythema marginatum perstans&quot;
The diagnosis of erythema marginatum can be made during examination of skin appearance. A skin biopsy may be performed if needed, to confirm the diagnosis. Medical history and family history may also be taken into account.

==Treatment==

Erythema marginatum can be treated with hydrocortisone and adrenocorticotropc hormone (ACTH).

In cases where the condition is associated with ARF and severe carditis, corticosteroids are indicated alongside the classic treatment protocol for ARF which is a 10-day course of oral Penicillin. Alternatively, one dosage of Penicillin G benzathine may be injected intramuscularly followed with a daily course of oral Amoxicillin for a total of 10 days. In cases of Penicillin allergy, a Cephalosporin or Macrolide may be considered. To avoid recurrences of ARF, secondary prevention is called for. This may include a period of antibiotic prophylaxis determined by the presence of carditis and the amount of remaining heart damage.

<text>Ferdinand-Jean Darier (; 26 April 1856 – 1938) was a French physician, pathologist and dermatologist called the &quot;father of modern dermatology in France&quot;.

== Career ==
===Medical===
Born in Pest, Hungary to French parents, Darier studied with Louis-Antoine Ranvier (1835–1922) at the Collège de France.

Darier discovered several diseases, most notably Darier&#x27;s disease, a peculiar figurate erythema, which he identified in 1889 as &quot;psorodermose folliculaire végétante&quot;. The other diseases were a follicular keratosis (Darier-White syndrome), dermatofibrosarcoma (Darier-Ferrand disease), erythema annularis, subcutaneous sarcoidosis (Darier-Roussy sarcoid), and a sign, Darier&#x27;s sign observed in mastocytosis.

From 1909 to 1922, Darier was head of the clinical department at the Hôpital Saint-Louis. He was one of the &quot;big five&quot; of the Paris School of Dermatology, along with Ernest Henri Besnier (1831–1909), Louis-Anne-Jean Brocq (1856–1928), Raymond Sabouraud (1864–1938) and Jean Alfred Fournier (1832–1915).

Darier wrote the dermatology textbook &quot;Précis de dermatologie&quot;, which was published in 1909 and translated into Spanish, German and English. He was also the editor of the dermatological encyclopedia &quot;Nouvelle Pratique Dermatologique&quot;, which was published in eight volumes, beginning in 1936.

===Political===
Besides his medical activities, Darier was the mayor of the town Longpont-sur-Orge from 1925 to 1935.

== List of works ==
* &quot;De l&#x27;artérite syphilitique&quot; (1904)
* &quot;Précis de dermatologie&quot; (1909)

<doc id="1263951" wikidata="Q5214096" url="?curid=1263951" title="Dan Newman">
<text>Dan Newman (born January 16, 1963) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2003, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

==Background==
Newman was educated at University College at the University of Toronto, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1987. From 1985 to 1995, he worked as manager of the Toronto Sun Publishing Corporation. Many would later accuse the Sun, a center right forum, of being uncritically supportive of the Mike Harris government. Newman also served as President of the Scarborough PC Association in 1992–93.

==Politics==
Newman was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Mary Anne Plimbett and incumbent New Democrat Steve Owens in the riding of Scarborough Centre. The Tories won a majority government and Newman served as a backbench supporter of Mike Harris&#x27;s government.

He was re-elected in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal candidate Adrian Heaps and New Democrat Michael Yorke in the re-distributed riding of Scarborough Southwest.

On March 3, 2000, Newman was appointed to cabinet as Minister of the Environment. This appointment occurred just before a serious outbreak of E. coli poisoning in Walkerton, Ontario, in which several people died following the contamination of the town&#x27;s water supply. Many blamed the Harris government&#x27;s privatization of water inspection for the tragedy.

Newman, as Environment Minister, bore the brunt of this criticism and was forced to defend his government&#x27;s policies before an increasingly skeptical public. In the aftermath of the tragedy, he announced a public investigation and stricter standards for municipal water treatment.

On February 8, 2001, Newman was appointed as Minister of Northern Development and Mines. When Ernie Eves replaced Harris as Premier on April 15, 2002, he named Newman as Associate Minister of Health and Long-Term Care.

Newman was defeated in the 2003 provincial election, losing to Liberal Lorenzo Berardinetti by almost 6,000 votes.

==Background and early career==
Diallo, a member of the Fula ethnic group, was born in Labé. He studied at the University of Conakry and the Center for Financial, Economic and Banking Studies in Paris, and in 1976 he became an inspector of trade. He began working at the Bank of Foreign Trade of Guinea in 1982, and from 1985 to 1995 he worked at the Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea.

After briefly working at the Administration and Control of Great Projects (&quot;l’Administration et Contrôle des Grands Projets&quot;, ACGP), Diallo joined the government in July 1996 as Minister of Transport, Telecommunications and Tourism. He was subsequently moved to the position of Minister of Infrastructure in October 1997, where he remained until he was appointed as Minister of Public Works and Transport on 12 March 1999. After UTA Flight 141, a flight from Guinea, crashed in Cotonou, Benin in December 2003, Diallo said that there was no proof that his ministry had been neglectful of safety and that he would not resign. Diallo served for five years as Minister of Public Works and Transport before being moved to the position of Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture on 23 February 2004.

==Prime minister==

On 9 December 2004, Diallo was appointed as prime minister by President Lansana Conté. The position of prime minister had previously been vacant since April 2004 due to the resignation of François Lonseny Fall. Diallo took office as prime minister on 13 December.

Diallo—who speaks English in addition to French—played a role in the Conté regime. However, allegations of corruption coupled with disagreements with Conté&#x27;s top associates, particularly Fodé Bangoura, the Secretary-General of the Presidency, and Mamadou Sylla, a wealthy businessman, culminated in Diallo&#x27;s removal from his prime minister post.

On 4 April 2006, changes to the government which would have greatly increased Diallo&#x27;s power were announced. These changes would have replaced a number of ministers with Diallo&#x27;s own allies and would have placed Diallo personally in charge of several portfolios, including those of economy, finance, international cooperation, and planning. The decree approving the changes was said to be signed by President Conté, but it was later speculated that Conté might not have realized the significance of what he was signing at the time. A radio broadcast announcing the changes was interrupted by soldiers, which was said to be because Fodé Bangoura had not been notified in advance. On the next day, it was announced that Diallo&#x27;s changes were reversed, and a few hours later it was announced that Diallo had been dismissed as prime minister &quot;for serious misconduct&quot;.

Although there were subsequently reports that Diallo had been placed under house arrest, he denied this in an interview with IRIN and thanked Conté for maintaining confidence in him during his time in the government.

==Opposition leader==
On 8 November 2007, an opposition political party, the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG), announced that it had appointed Diallo as its president, succeeding Mamadou Boye Bah. After he took office as the group&#x27;s leader, Diallo said on 15 November that he believed that Conté would not run in the 2010 presidential election; he also said that he &quot;always maintained good relations with General Lansana Conté and his family&quot;.

Following the appointment of Ahmed Tidiane Souaré as prime minister, Diallo was present, along with other former ministers, when Souaré gave a press conference on 22 May 2008. On 28 May, he was one of the party leaders who met with Souaré to discuss the formation of a national unity government.

Conté died in December 2008 and soldiers immediately seized power in a military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. About 20 soldiers searched Diallo&#x27;s home on 1 January 2009, while holding Diallo and his family at gunpoint. According to Diallo, the search was based on suspicions that Diallo might have weapons and mercenaries as part of a coup plot, but he said that the soldiers did not take anything from his home. A junta delegation met with Diallo on 2 January and condemned the search, saying that &quot;uncontrollable elements out to hurt the junta&quot; were to blame and that the junta had nothing to do with it.

Diallo tried to hold a meeting in Kerouane in June 2009, but the junta did not allow him to do so; it also would not let him stay overnight in Kankan. After junta leader Moussa Dadis Camara suggested in August 2009 that he might stand as a presidential candidate in the planned 2010 election, Diallo urged him not to do so, saying that the election&#x27;s &quot;transparency and reliability ... require[d] the administration&#x27;s neutrality and impartiality&quot;. After spending time in France and Senegal, he returned to Conakry on 13 September 2009 and was greeted at the airport by about 60,000 supporters.

On 28 September 2009, Diallo participated in a massive opposition protest in Conakry, which was directed against Camara&#x27;s suspected aspirations to run for president in 2010. He was injured at the protest, in which soldiers opened fire on the protesters and allegedly killed 157 people; three of his ribs were reportedly broken. Subsequently, he was barred from leaving the country for medical treatment on 30 September, but soon afterwards he was transported to Dakar aboard the Senegalese presidential plane, and from there he was flown to Paris for treatment.

Diallo placed first in the first round of the 2010 presidential election, but he was defeated by Alpha Condé in the second round.

On 25 July 2015, Diallo was named as the UFDG&#x27;s candidate for the 2015 presidential election at a party congress; he was also re-elected to lead the party for another five years.

The UFDG nominated Diallo as president in the 2020 Guinean presidential election. Diallo received only 33% of the vote but declared himself the victor. This prompted riots which led to over 30 deaths as well as barricades around Diallo&#x27;s home and the UFDG&#x27;s headquarters. Ten days after the election, Diallo&#x27;s house arrest was lifted.

In September 2021, Cellou Dalein Diallo supported the putschists who carried out the 2021 coup.

<doc id="1263962" wikidata="Q4700653" url="?curid=1263962" title="Akershus University Hospital">
<text>Akershus University Hospital (, abbreviated Ahus) is a Norwegian public university hospital in the Greater Oslo Region. It is located in the Lørenskog municipality in Akershus county, northeast of the Norwegian capital Oslo. It is a teaching hospital and one of two university hospitals affiliated with the University of Oslo, alongside the larger Oslo University Hospital. The hospital has around 10,000 employees and a capacity of around 950 beds. In 2018, there were approximately 2,600 health, medical, and nursing students in placements or internships within the hospital.

==History==
Akershus University Hospital was officially opened on 15 May 1961 as the Akershus Central Hospital (SIA). The area on which it was built, Nordbyhagen in Lørenskog eventually became developed with more homes and apartments, nursery schools, convenience stores, and several buildings associated with hospital functions. In 1978, the hospital began its second major phase, and it has since built a series of individual buildings and minor additions to the hospital.

The Norwegian Parliament (the &quot;Storting&quot;) decided in 1999 that the then Central Hospital of Akershus (SIA) would be a teaching hospital. The first teaching program started in 2001 and was expanded to cover the full study period soon after. Today the &quot;faculty division&quot; is one of the ten departments affiliated with the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Oslo.

===The new hospital===
In 2003 the Norwegian parliament gave the go-ahead for a new University Hospital in Akershus to be built. On 18 December 2003, the executive board at the Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority determined that construction work would start in March 2004. It was to be designed by the Danish architects from the firm C.F Møller and was estimated to cost around $1.7bn. On 1 March 2004 Health Minister Dagfinn Høybråten turned the sod. In October 2008, the new hospital building designed by Danish architects Arkitektfirmaet C. F. Møller opened. Setting new standards for hospital architecture in Norway, at the time of its construction, it was claimed to be the most modern in Europe.

==The research center==
After Akershus University Hospital became a teaching hospital in 2000, a separate Center for Research () was established. Since then, the research center has taken an increasingly central place in the hospital. The hospital houses 26 separate research groups working on somatic and psychiatric topics.

The Hospital aims to ensure that both the research and teaching at the hospital maintain a high professional level and that the foundation of research activity must center on the hospital&#x27;s own patients. The research aims to improve both diagnosis and treatment methodologies, using progressive, modern technology while maintaining cost-effectiveness.

Research is undertaken in all departments of the hospital. The research center is responsible for approximately 250 scientific publications per year, in some of the world&#x27;s leading journals. In 2012, an article featuring research on fear during childbirth received international attention.

==Arts and decorations==
Akershus University Hospital was constructed alongside a special art project. Research has shown that experiencing art has positive health effects and helps treat illnesses such as hypertension, and the hope was that the art would open patients to different cognitive and sensory experiences. The art collection currently includes twelve major works, which were designed specifically for their unique space. They are found both inside the &quot;glass street&quot; (the main hallway/atrium) or outdoors around the campus. The art collection now includes unrelated works, such as drawings, paintings, and photographs, as well as a new exhibition of a selection of photos from the old hospital building. The artists desired for their work to be read and experienced as art, even if it is integrated into the building&#x27;s architecture.

Many of the original works are of renowned artists including; Troels Wörsel, Tony Cragg, Julie Nord, Per Sundberg, Ernst Billgren and Vesa Honkonen.

<doc id="1263963" wikidata="Q354954" url="?curid=1263963" title="Jeff Wayne">
<text>Jeffry Wayne (born 1 July 1943) is an American composer, musician and lyricist. In 1978, he released &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot;, his musical adaptation of H. G. Wells&#x27; science-fiction novel &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Wayne wrote approximately 3,000 advertising jingles in the 1970s which appeared on television in the United Kingdom, including a Gordon&#x27;s Gin commercial which was covered by the Human League. Wayne also composed numerous television themes, including &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; (TV-am), ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Big Match&quot; and &quot;World of Sport&quot;, and the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot;.

Wayne wrote feature film and documentary film scores and was musical director for various artists. Wayne published a book called &quot;The Book of Tennis&quot; and created, produced and scored eight thirty-minute episodes of &quot;The Book of Tennis Chronicles&quot; that was distributed by Fox Sports in approximately twenty countries, and was broadcast in the US on the Tennis Channel between 2005 and 2008.

== Early life ==
Jeff Wayne was born on 1 July 1943, in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, United States. His father, Jerry Wayne &quot;(né&quot; Jerome Marvin Krauth; 1916–1996), was an American actor, singer, and theatre producer. Jeff Wayne spent four years of his childhood in the UK when his father played romantic gambler Sky Masterson in the original West End musical production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

Four years later they returned to New York. Wayne graduated from Stephen Halsey Jr. High and attended Forest Hills High School for one year, and played for its tennis team, before moving to California. Wayne graduated from Grant High School, then from Los Angeles Valley College with a journalism degree. He played keyboards in local bands and coached tennis to support himself. After completing his journalism degree he switched to music, playing keyboards briefly with the Sandpipers.

== Musical career ==
In 1966, Wayne composed the score for his father&#x27;s West End musical &quot;Two Cities&quot; based on Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; which ran at London&#x27;s Palace Theatre. The musical was successful, winning for Edward Woodward the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award for Best Male Performance in a Musical for 1968–69. Returning to the UK, Wayne became a record producer. In 1970 or 1971, he made a single, &quot;The Bittermen Theme&quot;, featuring Chris Spedding on guitar, a version of which was used in a television commercial for Ansells bitter. Wayne helped produce David Essex&#x27;s album &quot;Rock On&quot;. Essex was subsequently a voice actor in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, playing the part of the Artilleryman. Wayne also provided the score for the 1977 action thriller &quot;Golden Rendezvous&quot;, which starred Richard Harris.

=== &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; ===
In 1978, &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot; was released, achieving international success. Wayne&#x27;s two-disc composition sold millions of copies around the world and was the 40th best selling album of all time in the UK by 2009. It included worldwide hit singles &quot;The Eve of the War&quot; and &quot;Forever Autumn&quot;, both sung by Justin Hayward, and included narration throughout by Richard Burton. It won two Ivor Novello Awards and &quot;The Best Recording in Science Fiction and Fantasy&quot; (the judges included Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Alfred Hitchcock). &quot;The Eve of the War&quot; was used by the offshore radio station Radio Delmare as its theme tune. The album was re-released on Super Audio CD in 2005; five tracks were remastered and placed on the second disc (mostly without Wayne&#x27;s input). A Limited Edition 7-disc Collector&#x27;s Edition CD and DVD box set, which included remixes, outtakes, and documentary, was issued in 2005.

Wayne announced a new &quot;Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot; album to be released in June 2012 titled &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds – The New Generation&quot;. The album was released in November 2012.

=== Later work ===
After &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, Wayne continued to compose and produce music, such as the music for the 1979 television film &quot;The Knowledge&quot; and the Who&#x27;s movie &quot;McVicar&quot; released in 1980. Wayne composed music for the Fry&#x27;s Turkish Delight advertisement in 1981, the theme for &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; in 1982 on TV-am, and music for the 1984 album &quot;Beyond the Planets&quot;, Kevin Peek and Rick Wakeman&#x27;s progressive rock recording of Holst&#x27;s orchestral suite.

In 1992 Wayne released &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of Spartacus&quot;, his first major release since &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. Its cast included Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and Marillion&#x27;s Fish. It featured a libretto by Gary Osborne and a story combining powerful themes of oppression, desperation, love and death.

Wayne was involved in producing &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s The War of the Worlds&quot; in 1998, a computer game that included 45 minutes of music from his &quot;Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot;, re-scored and remixed in an electronica style with techno beats. The game also featured computer-generated visualisations of numerous scenes from the album – an idea Wayne would later revisit. In 1999, a related game, also titled &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s The War of the Worlds&quot;, was released for the Sony PlayStation.

&quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; was re-released in the summer of 2005. It spent ten consecutive weeks in the Top 10 of the UK Album charts. Including this re-release, the album achieved sales to 3 million in the UK, and approximately 14 million worldwide. Also in 2005, it was announced that the musical would be going on a UK tour in April 2006. The live show was taken to Australia and New Zealand and returned the UK during December 2007. The show, produced by Damian Collier, used a ten-piece band and a 48-piece string orchestra, voice actors, screen-projected images and animatronics. Universal Pictures released a DVD of the show, filmed at Wembley Arena using 23 high definition cameras and directed by David Mallet. In 2022, the UK Arena tour relaunched following the Covid-19 outbreak. The tour premiered at Nottingham&#x27;s Motorpoint Arena on 23 March and once again starred Justin Hayward as the sung thoughts of The Journalist. Other notable cast for this tour include Claire Richards (Steps) as Beth, Duncan James (Blue) as Parson Nathaniel and Kevin Clifton (Strictly Come Dancing) as the Artilleryman. The show also featured a holographic version of Liam Neeson as the Journalist.

Wayne&#x27;s first television series, &quot;The Book of Tennis Chronicles&quot;, was broadcast worldwide in 2005 and distributed by Fox Sports. It features well-known tennis players and events, set against events in world history from 1877 to 2005. Wayne created and produced eight half-hour episodes and scored its music. The series&#x27; executive producer was Damian Collier.

A keen player and follower of tennis throughout his life, Wayne remains involved with the sport; he has won the British National Indoor Veterans singles and doubles titles, and the National Clay Court doubles. In 1992 he partnered former Great Britain No. 1 and Davis Cup captain Roger Taylor at the European Veteran Championships. In 1999, Wayne represented Great Britain in the Austria Cup in Spain, and achieved an ITF world ranking in his age group. In 2008 Wayne was elected into the International Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain. Wayne has also played in numerous fundraising pro-am tournaments, including for Muscular dystrophy and Save the Children.

<text>Intamin Amusement Rides is a design and manufacturing company in Schaan, Liechtenstein, best-known for designing and constructing thrill rides and roller coasters at dozens of international theme parks, amusement parks and other establishments. The Intamin brand name is a syllabic abbreviation for &quot;international amusement installations&quot;. The company has corporate offices across the world, including three in Europe, three in Asia, and two in the United States.

==Products and technologies==
Intamin&#x27;s product range spans two broad categories: rides and transportation.

===Amusement rides===
====Roller coasters====
Intamin created the first hydraulic launch system (known as the Accelerator Coaster), which catapults roller coaster trains from standstill to speeds upwards of in a few seconds before climbing to immense heights. Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure, for instance, was North America&#x27;s tallest and fastest coaster, launching riders from 0– in 3.5 seconds.

Intamin uses computerized and industrialized engineering and manufacturing methods for its wooden coasters, rather than traditional on-site fabrication. Coasters such as Colossos at Heide Park, Balder at Liseberg and El Toro at Six Flags Great Adventure utilized this manufacturing technique. Unlike other traditional wood coasters, these rides use prefabricated track sections made of a high-strength wooden laminate that can be secured on-site when the superstructure is completed. This design enables the coaster to reach speeds and navigate course elements smoothly, like a steel roller coaster, while retaining the look and some of the traditional feel of common wooden coasters.

====Ferris wheels====


Intamin brokered a number of rides that were manufactured by Waagner-Biro. These included a series of rides for Marriott Corporation, each comprising a vertical column supporting multiple horizontal arms, with each arm supporting a Ferris wheel. The first was Giant Wheel which operated at Hersheypark in Hershey, Pennsylvania, from 1973 until 2004. Similar Intamin supplied Waagner-Biro wheels included Zodiac (Kings Island, Mason, Ohio) and Scorpion (Parque de la Ciudad, Buenos Aires, Argentina). All are now defunct.

Sky Whirl, the world&#x27;s first triple Ferris wheel, which debuted at both Marriott&#x27;s Great America parks (now Six Flags Great America, Gurnee, Illinois, and California&#x27;s Great America, Santa Clara) in 1976, was also manufactured by Waagner-Biro and brokered by Intamin. Also known as a triple Ferris wheel, Triple Giant Wheel, or Triple Tree Wheel, it was in height. The Santa Clara ride, renamed Triple Wheel in post-Marriott years, closed on 1 September 1997. The Gurnee ride closed in 2000.

The Orlando Eye, which opened in April 2015, was designed and built by Intamin.

===Transportation===
Outside the amusement realm, Intamin supplies monorail transportation systems which are used in both public transport networks and at tourist attractions across the world. Intamin was responsible for the design and building of the Moscow Monorail (), which is long and is located in the North-Eastern Administrative Okrug of Moscow, Russia, running from the Timiryazevskaya metro station to Sergeya Eisensteina street. Planning of the monorail started in 1998. It has six stations.

In 2016, two monorails using Intamin equipment were opened: the Ashgabat Monorail in Turkmenistan; and the Calabar Monorail in the Cross River State, Nigeria, which connects the Calabar International Convention Centre to the Tinapa Resort.

In 2020, the Marconi Express Monorail opened as a shuttle between the Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport and the Bologna Centrale railway station.

Intamin has also constructed monorails at amusement parks in Xi&#x27;an and Ningbo in China, and the Asia Park Monorail in Da Nang in Vietnam.

==Incidents==
Intamin has been in the news for a number of safety-related incidents.
* In 1984, three passengers riding The Edge at Six Flags Great America were injured and briefly hospitalized. The ride experienced a malfunction that caused it to fall backward down the wrong shaft.
* On June 9, 1991, 32-year-old Candy Taylor of Toledo, Ohio, fell to her death from Flight Commander, an Intamin Flight Trainer, located at Kings Island. Investigators determined that a design flaw in the seat divider could allow a rider to slide into an unoccupied seat and become free from the restraint. A coroner&#x27;s report later revealed that the victim had a blood-alcohol level of 0.30 which may have also contributed. Speculation suggests the rider lost consciousness during the ride and slid out from the restraints.
* On May 16, 1999, a guest was unable to close his lap bar on Ride of Steel at Six Flags Darien Lake. As a result, he was ejected, fell approximately 9 feet as the ride went over a camel hump hill, and suffered serious injuries. He sued the park and the ride manufacturer for negligence and was awarded US$3.95 million.
* In August 1999, a 12-year-old mentally disabled boy fell from the 207-foot (63 m) high Drop Tower: Scream Zone, at California&#x27;s Great America, and died. The victim&#x27;s family claimed his harness was not locked properly. An investigation was inconclusive and no charges were filed.
* In September 2001, a 40-year-old woman fell from Perilous Plunge (Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm) into the water, was hit by the boat, and died. An investigation showed that the woman had loosened the safety restraints, so she could fit more comfortably into the ride.
* On April 16, 2004, a 16-year-old girl from Pontypool was killed after falling approximately 30 m (100 ft) into shallow water from the top of Hydro (now called Drenched) at Oakwood Leisure Park, Narberth, Pembrokeshire, United Kingdom. During a lawsuit brought by the victim&#x27;s family against Oakwood, a jury returned a narrative verdict stating that the victim had fallen out due to being improperly restrained.
* The second incident of 2004 was on one of Intamin&#x27;s mega coasters, , at Six Flags New England in Massachusetts. The ride, again with lap bar restraints, was dispatched with a rider who had cerebral palsy in the front seat; this passenger subsequently died after being ejected from his seat. According to an investigation, the ride operators were primarily to blame, for not ensuring the rider was properly secured. Intamin was also partially blamed, as the ride&#x27;s safety system allowed the train to be dispatched without all of the restraints properly secured.
* The third incident of 2004 happened on July 14, on Cedar Point&#x27;s Top Thrill Dragster. During the initial launch, in which the train accelerates from 0 to in 4 seconds, the riders were struck by metal debris that sheared off from the coaster&#x27;s launch cable. The majority of guests waiting in the queue line would be standing no more than 10 to 15 feet from the track, at closest range. They were treated at the park&#x27;s first aid station. Two were further treated at Firelands Regional Medical Center.
* In June 2007, a 13-year-old girl lost both feet at the ankles on Superman: Tower of Power, at Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom, when a ride malfunction and improper maintenance caused a cable to snap. She was brought to the hospital in critical condition, but survived, with doctors being able to re-attach her right foot. The park was later fined $1,000 for not properly maintaining the ride; an undisclosed settlement was later reached with Six Flags, which will provide for her for the remainder of her life.
* On September 16, 2009, two guests were injured when the launch cable snapped on Xcelerator at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm. The train launches riders from 0 to 80 miles per hour in a matter of seconds, ascends a vertical top-hat, and descends down the other side. The 12-year-old victim had lacerations on his leg, while the adult victim complained of back injuries.
* On April 29, 2010, a ride train on Expedition GeForce partially derailed from the track, fully occupied with passengers. Riders were stranded 20m in the air, with eight of them complaining of nausea and bruising.
* On July 8, 2011, a 29-year-old guest was killed when he was ejected from Superman: Ride of Steel. The rider, an Iraq War veteran whose legs had been amputated, was on the front row of the roller coaster when he was thrown from the train during the course of the ride. Park officials stated that the ride was in proper mechanical order and that the various safety restraints were also working normally at the time of the incident, but that the attraction would remain closed pending an investigation. It was determined that ride operators at the time should not have permitted the man to get on the ride, due to his status as a double amputee. 
* On February 24, 2012, a 14-year-old girl died in an accident at Hopi Hari, Vinhedo, São Paulo State, Brazil. She fell from the La Tour Eiffel drop tower ride, suffered cranial trauma, and died on the way to hospital. Initial investigations suggested the possibility of mechanical failure in a restraint latch.
* On July 24, 2012, the launch cable of the accelerator coaster Rita at Alton Towers, Staffordshire, UK, snapped during a morning test run. There were no passengers aboard at the time and no injuries occurred.
* On July 19, 2013, a boat on the Shoot the Rapids log flume (at Cedar Point) rolled back down the ride&#x27;s lift hill and flipped over, injuring seven, and was said to leave them stranded under water for a few minutes before guests and park employees could get them out. Six were cleared by park medical staff, and one was examined at a local hospital before being released. The ride closed during the investigation. Cedar Point reopened the ride in May 2014 but it would close in 2015.
* On July 7, 2014, a teenager was killed after his harness sprung open on Inferno, a ZacSpin fourth-dimension roller coaster at Terra Mítica in Benidorm, Spain.
* On May 9, 2017, an 11-year-old girl, Evha Jannath, died from her injuries after she fell from the Splash Canyon ride and into the water at Drayton Manor Theme Park in England. The water ride has remained closed for the foreseeable future, following the HSE safety examination.
*On July 3, 2021, an 11-year-old boy died and five others were injured on the Raging River at Adventureland Park in Altoona, Iowa when their raft flipped over. The raft was found to be under inflated by the park staff, and the ride&#x27;s emergency drainage system failed due to lack of maintenance.

*On August 15, 2021, a female guest was seriously injured while standing in line at Cedar Point when a metal object dislodged from Top Thrill Dragster and struck her in the head. The ride was shut down following the incident, and remained standing but not operating until Cedar Point announced its retirement in 2022. In 2024, the ride would reopen as Top Thrill 2, following significant modifications.
*On April 7, 2023, two female guests were injured at Futuroscope, a French theme park, when a lithium battery on a train car caught fire. The guests suffered burns and were hospitalized. Park employees exposed to lithium fumes were treated on premises. The ride has reopened in June without the spinning feature.

<text>For military personnel, a tour of duty is usually a period of time spent in combat or in a hostile environment. In an army, for instance, soldiers on active duty serve 24 hours a day, seven days a week for the length of their service commitment. Soldiers in World War II were deployed for the entire war and could be in active service for 4–5 years.

==Air force==

In World War II, Royal Air Force doctors had started to notice symptoms of battle fatigue in their pilots. Before 1942, there was no official limit for an operational tour. Some pilots had been flying over 200 missions with only a short break. The Senior Medical Officer of the RAF station Biggin Hill intervened, after learning that a flight sergeant had flown 200 missions over two years. A tour system was then adopted; the length of it varied, depending on the period, theatre, and operational requirements of the time. In Western Europe, it was set at 200 hours operational flying. In 1944 in South East Asia, the day fighter pilot&#x27;s tour was 300 hours or 12 months. In Bomber Command, the tour length was exceptionally based on the number of successful combat sorties (missions). The first tour was 30 sorties, and the second was 20 sorties. In Coastal Command, the maximum length of a tour depended on tasks and varied from 200 hours for fighter and strike squadrons to 800 hours for flying boats and four-engine land-plane crews.

The tour of duty for B-52 crewmen is four to six months.

During WWII in the USAAF bomber command, a tour of duty was 25 missions, and the first bomber B-17 crew to achieve this is that of the &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;. The first B-24 crew to achieve this was &quot;Hot Stuff,&quot; but they ended up flying five more missions before returning to the USA to sell war bonds.

==Navy==

In navies, a tour of duty is a period of time spent performing operational duties at sea, including combat, performing patrol or fleet duties, or assigned to service in a foreign country; a tour of duty is part of a rotation, where the ship may spend a six-month tour of duty, then spend one month in home port for maintenance, then a period of time on exercises, then return to her tour of duty. In 2018, most overseas tours for military personnel in the US Navy have been capped at two or three years. For US Navy sailors assigned to Japan, tour lengths might increase to four years. This would also include tours to Guam and Spain. Sailors extending their tours by at least 12 months will receive preferential consideration for announced billets.

In the Royal Navy (UK), operational tours last approximately nine months, although with the Royal Navy Reserves, the duration is only six months. A junior doctor may be on board a ship for a seven-month stint.

==Army==
A general tour of duty for soldiers comprises service that can last from half a year to four years. Generally, duties that last longer than two years are eligible to receive medals of merit related to their service. Tours of duty can also be extended involuntarily for service members, such as in September 2006, when the tour of duty was extended for 4,000 US military personnel in Iraq. They were increased up to 15 months for tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. As of 2018, typical tours are 6-9 or even 12 months&#x27; deployment depending upon the needs of the military and branch of service. Soldiers are eligible for two weeks of leave after six months of deployment.

In the UK, tours of duty are usually 6 months. In 2014, British Army tours in Afghanistan were extended to 8 months. Army doctors accompany their regiments on tours of duty for up to six months every two to three years.

<doc id="1263998" wikidata="Q74941" url="?curid=1263998" title="Slow loris">
<text>Slow lorises are a group of several species of nocturnal strepsirrhine primates that make up the genus Nycticebus. Found in Southeast Asia and nearby areas, they range from Bangladesh and Northeast India in the west to the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines in the east, and from Yunnan province in China in the north to the island of Java in the south. 

Although many previous classifications recognized as few as a single all-inclusive species, there are now at least eight that are considered valid: the Sunda slow loris (&quot;N. coucang&quot;), Bengal slow loris (&quot;N. bengalensis&quot;), Javan slow loris (&quot;N. javanicus&quot;), Philippine slow loris (&quot;N. menagensis&quot;), Bangka slow loris (&quot;N. bancanus&quot;), Bornean slow loris (&quot;N. borneanus&quot;), Kayan River slow loris (&quot;N. kayan&quot;) and Sumatran slow loris (&quot;N. hilleri&quot;). A ninth species, the pygmy slow loris (&quot;X. pygmaeus&quot;), was recently moved to the new genus &quot;Xanthonycticebus&quot;. After the pygmy slow loris, the group&#x27;s closest relatives are the slender lorises of southern India and Sri Lanka. Their next closest relatives are the African lorisids, the pottos, false pottos, and angwantibos. They are less closely related to the remaining lorisoids (the various types of galago), and more distantly to the lemurs of Madagascar. Their evolutionary history is uncertain since their fossil record is patchy and molecular clock studies have given inconsistent results.

Slow lorises have a round head, a narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration patterns that are species-dependent. Their arms and legs are nearly equal in length, and their torso is long and flexible, allowing them to twist and extend to nearby branches. The hands and feet of slow lorises have several adaptations that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time. Slow lorises have a toxic bite, a trait rare among mammals and unique among the primates. The toxin is obtained by licking a sweat gland on their arm, and the secretion is activated by mixing with saliva. Their toxic bite, once thought to be primarily a deterrent to predators, has been discovered to be primarily used in disputes within the species.

The secretion from the arm contains a chemical related to cat allergen, but may be augmented by secondary toxins from the diet in wild individuals. Slow lorises move slowly and deliberately, making little or no noise, and when threatened, they stop moving and remain motionless. Their only documented predators—apart from humans—include snakes, changeable hawk-eagles and orangutans, although cats, viverrids and sun bears are suspected. Little is known about their social structure, but they are known to communicate by scent marking. Males are highly territorial. Slow lorises reproduce slowly, and the infants are initially parked on branches or carried by either parent. They are omnivores, eating small animals, fruit, tree gum, and other vegetation.

Each of the slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 is listed as either &quot;Vulnerable&quot; or &quot;Endangered&quot; on the IUCN Red List. The three newest species are yet to be evaluated, but they arise from (and further reduce the ranks of) what was thought to be a single &quot;vulnerable&quot; species. All four of these are expected to be listed with at least the same, if not a higher-risk, conservation status. All slow lorises are threatened by the wildlife trade and habitat loss. Their habitat is rapidly disappearing and becoming fragmented, making it nearly impossible for slow lorises to disperse between forest fragments; unsustainable demand from the exotic pet trade and from traditional medicine has been the greatest cause for their decline.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Although many previous classifications recognized as few as a single all-inclusive species, there are now at least eight that are considered valid: 



Other than the pygmy slow loris in sister genus &quot;Xanthonycticebus&quot;, the group&#x27;s closest relatives are the slender lorises of southern India and Sri Lanka. Their next closest relatives are the African lorisids, the pottos, false pottos, and angwantibos. They are less closely related to the remaining lorisoids (the various types of galago), and more distantly to the lemurs of Madagascar. Their evolutionary history is uncertain since their fossil record is patchy and molecular clock studies have given inconsistent results.

===Evolutionary history===
Slow lorises (genus &quot;Nycticebus&quot;) are strepsirrhine primates and are related to other living lorisoids, such as the pygmy slow loris (&quot;Xanthonycticebus&quot;), slender lorises (&quot;Loris&quot;), pottos (&quot;Perodicticus&quot;), false pottos (&quot;Pseudopotto&quot;), angwantibos (&quot;Arctocebus&quot;), and galagos (family Galagidae), and to the lemurs of Madagascar. They are most closely related to the pygmy slow loris, followed by the slender lorises of South Asia, the angwantibos, pottos and false pottos of Central and West Africa. Lorisoids are thought to have evolved in Africa, where most living species occur; later, one group may have migrated to Asia and evolved into the slender and slow lorises of today.

Lorises first appear in the Asian fossil record in the Miocene, with records in Thailand around 18 million years ago (mya) and in Pakistan 16 mya. The Thai record is based on a single tooth that most closely resembles living slow lorises and that is tentatively classified as a species of &quot;Nycticebus&quot;. The species is named ? &quot;Nycticebus linglom&quot;, using open nomenclature (the preceding &quot;?&quot; indicates the tentative nature of the assignment).

Several lorises are found in the Siwalik deposits of Pakistan, dating to 16 to 8 mya, including &quot;Nycticeboides&quot; and &quot;Microloris&quot;. Most are small, but an unnamed form dating to 15–16 mya is comparable in size to the largest living slow lorises. Molecular clock analysis suggests that slow lorises may have started evolving into distinct species about 10 mya. They are thought to have reached the islands of Sundaland when the Sunda Shelf was exposed at times of low sea level, creating a land bridge between the mainland and islands off the coast of Southeast Asia.

====Discovery and taxonomy====

The earliest known mention of a slow loris in scientific literature is from 1770, when Dutchman Arnout Vosmaer (1720–1799) described a specimen of what we know today as &quot;N. bengalensis&quot; that he had received two years earlier. The French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, later questioned Vosmaer&#x27;s decision to affiliate the animal with sloths, arguing that it was more closely aligned with the lorises of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Bengal. The word &quot;loris&quot; was first used in 1765 by Buffon as a close equivalent to a Dutch name, &quot;loeris&quot;. This etymology was later supported by the physician William Baird in the 1820s, who noted that the Dutch word &quot;loeris&quot; signified &quot;a clown&quot;.

In 1785, the Dutch physician and naturalist Pieter Boddaert was the first to officially describe a species of slow loris using the name &quot;Tardigradus coucang&quot;. This species was based on the &quot;tailless maucauco&quot; described by Thomas Pennant in 1781, which is thought to have been based on a Sunda slow loris, and on Vosmaer&#x27;s description of a Bengal slow loris. Consequently, there has been some disagreement over the identity of &quot;Tardigradus coucang&quot;; currently the name is given to the Sunda slow loris. The next slow loris species to be described was &quot;Lori bengalensis&quot; (currently &quot;Nycticebus bengalensis&quot;), named by Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1800.

In 1812, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire named the genus &quot;Nycticebus&quot;, naming it for its nocturnal behavior. The name derives from the , genitive form of (, &quot;night&quot;), and (, &quot;monkey&quot;). Geoffroy also named &quot;Nycticebus javanicus&quot; in this work. Later 19th-century authors also called the slow lorises &quot;Nycticebus&quot;, but most used the species name &quot;tardigradus&quot; (given by Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturæ&quot;) for slow lorises, until mammalogists Witmer Stone and James A. G. Rehn clarified in 1902 that Linnaeus&#x27;s name actually referred to a slender loris.

Several more species were named around 1900, including &quot;Nycticebus menagensis&quot; (originally &quot;Lemur menagensis&quot;) by Richard Lydekker in 1893 and &quot;Nycticebus pygmaeus&quot; by John James Lewis Bonhote in 1907. However, in 1939 Reginald Innes Pocock consolidated all slow lorises into a single species, &quot;N. coucang&quot;, and in his influential 1953 book &quot;Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy&quot;, primatologist William Charles Osman Hill also followed this course. In 1971 Colin Groves recognized the pygmy slow loris (&quot;N. pygmaeus&quot;) as a separate species, and divided &quot;N. coucang&quot; into four subspecies, while in 2001 Groves opined there were three species (&quot;N. coucang&quot;, &quot;N. pygmaeus&quot;, and &quot;N. bengalensis&quot;), and that &quot;N. coucang&quot; had three subspecies (&quot;Nycticebus coucang coucang&quot;, &quot;N. c. menagensis&quot;, and &quot;N. c. javanicus&quot;).
In 2006, the Bornean slow loris was elevated to the species level (as &quot;Nycticebus menagensis&quot;) based on molecular analysis of DNA sequences of the D-loop and the cytochrome &quot;b&quot; gene. In 2008, Groves and Ibnu Maryanto confirmed the promotion of the fifth species, the Javan slow loris, to species status, a move that had been suggested in previous studies from 2000. They based their decision on an analysis of cranial morphology and characteristics of pelage. Species differentiation was based largely on differences in morphology, such as size, fur color, and head markings.

To help clarify species and subspecies boundaries, and to establish whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus &quot;Nycticebus&quot; were investigated by Chen and colleagues using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D-loop and cytochrome &quot;b&quot;. Previous molecular analyses using karyotypes, restriction enzymes, and DNA sequences were focused on understanding the relationships between a few species, not the phylogeny of the entire genus. The analyses published in 2006 by Chen and colleagues&#x27; proved inconclusive, although one test suggested that &quot;N. coucang&quot; and &quot;N. bengalensis&quot; apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with members of their own species, possibly due to introgressive hybridization since the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand. This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between &quot;N. bengalensis&quot; and &quot;N. coucang&quot;, and suggested that there has been gene flow between the two species.

In 2012, two taxonomic synonyms (formerly recognized as subspecies) of &quot;N. menagensis&quot;—&quot;N. bancanus&quot; and &quot;N. borneanus&quot;—were elevated to species status, and a new species—&quot;N. kayan&quot;—was also distinguished from the same. Rachel Munds, Anna Nekaris and Susan Ford based these taxonomic revisions on distinguishable facial markings. With that, the &quot;N. menagensis&quot; species complex that had been collectively known as the Bornean slow loris became four species: the Philippine slow loris (&quot;N. menagensis&quot;), the Bornean slow loris (&quot;N. borneanus&quot;), the Bangka slow loris (&quot;N. bancanus&quot;), and the Kayan River slow loris (&quot;N. kayan&quot;).

Nekaris and Nijman (2022) combined morphological, behavioural, karyotypical and genetic data and suggested that the pygmy slow loris is best placed in its own genus, &quot;Xanthonycticebus.&quot;
==Anatomy and physiology==

Slow lorises have a round head because their skull is shorter than in other living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, their snout does not taper towards the front of the face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared with the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital distance is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.
The ears are small, sparsely covered in hair, and hidden in the fur. Similar to the slender lorises, the fur around and directly above the eyes is dark. Unlike the slender lorises, however, the white stripe that separates the eye rings broadens both on the tip of the nose and on the forehead while also fading out on the forehead. Like other strepsirrhine primates, the nose and lip are covered by a moist skin called the rhinarium (&quot;wet nose&quot;), which is a sense organ.

The eyes of slow lorises are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes are large and possess a reflective layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene that would allow them to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.

The dental formula of slow lorises is , meaning that on each side of the mouth there are two upper (maxillary) and lower (mandibular) incisors, one upper and lower canine tooth, three upper and lower premolars, and three upper and lower molars, giving a total of 36 permanent teeth. As in all other crown strepsirrhines, their lower incisors and canine are procumbent (lie down and face outwards), forming a toothcomb, which is used for personal and social grooming and feeding. The toothcomb is kept clean by the sublingua or &quot;under-tongue&quot;, a specialized structure that acts like a toothbrush to remove hair and other debris. The sublingua extends below the tip of the tongue and is tipped with keratinized, serrated points that rake between the front teeth.

Slow lorises have relatively large maxillary canine teeth, their inner (mesial) maxillary incisors are larger than the outer (distal) maxillary incisors, and they have a diastema (gap) between the canine and the first premolar. The first mandibular premolar is elongated, and the last molar has three cusps on the crown, the shortest of which is near the back. The bony palate (roof of the mouth) only goes as far back as the second molar.

Slow lorises range in weight from the Bornean slow loris at to as much as for the Bengal slow loris. Slow lorises have stout bodies, and their tails are only stubs and hidden beneath the dense fur. Their combined head and body lengths vary by species, but range from between all species. The trunk is longer than in other living strepsirrhines because they have 15–16 thoracic vertebrae, compared to 12–14 in other living strepsirrhines. This gives them greater mobility when twisting and extending towards nearby branches. Their other vertebrae include seven cervical vertebrae, six or seven lumbar vertebrae, six or seven sacral vertebrae, and seven to eleven caudal vertebrae.
Unlike galagos, which have longer legs than arms, slow lorises have arms and legs of nearly equal length. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, indicating that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs. As with the slender lorises, their arms are slightly longer than their body, but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout.

Slow lorises have a powerful grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° from the rest of the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs.

The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.

Slow lorises have an unusually low basal metabolic rate, about 40% of the typical value for placental mammals of their size, comparable to that of sloths. Since they consume a relatively high-calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on &quot;Gluta&quot; bark, which may be fatal to humans.

==Distribution and diversity==
Slow lorises are found in South and Southeast Asia. Their collective range stretches from Northeast India through Indochina, east to the Sulu Archipelago (the small, southern islands of the Philippines), and south to the island of Java (including Borneo, Sumatra, and many small nearby islands). They are found in India (Northeastern states), China (Yunnan province), Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, and Singapore.

There are currently seven recognized species. The Bornean slow loris (&quot;N. menagensis&quot;), found on Borneo and nearby islands, including the Sulu Archipelago, and in 2012 was split into four distinct species (adding &quot;N. bancanus&quot;, &quot;N. borneanus&quot;, and &quot;N. kayan&quot;). The Javan slow loris (&quot;N. javanicus&quot;) is only found on the island of Java in Indonesia. The Sunda slow loris (&quot;N. coucang&quot;) occurs on Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, including Singapore and southern Thailand (the Isthmus of Kra). The Bengal slow loris (&quot;N. bengalensis&quot;) has the largest distribution of all the slow lorises and can be found in Bangladesh, Cambodia, southern China, Northeast India, Laos, Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Slow lorises range across tropical and subtropical regions and are found in primary and secondary rainforests, as well as bamboo groves and mangrove forests. They prefer forests with high, dense canopies, although some species have also been found in disturbed habitats, such as cacao plantations and mixed-crop home gardens. Due largely to their nocturnal behavior and the subsequent difficulties in accurately quantifying abundance, data about the population size or distribution patterns of slow lorises is limited. In general, encounter rates are low; a combined analysis of several field studies involving transect surveys conducted in South and Southeast Asia determined encounter rates ranging from as high as 0.74 lorises per kilometer for &quot;N. coucang&quot; to as low as 0.1 lorises per kilometer for &quot;N. bengalensis&quot;.

==Behavior and ecology==

Little is known about the social structure of slow lorises, but they generally spend most of the night foraging alone. Individuals sleep during the day, usually alone but occasionally with other slow lorises. Home ranges of adults may significantly overlap, and those of males are generally larger than those of females. In the absence of direct studies of the genus, primatologist Simon Bearder speculated that slow loris social behavior is similar to that of the potto, another nocturnal primate.

Such a social system is distinguished by a lack of matriarchy and by factors that allow the slow loris to remain inconspicuous and minimize energy expenditure. Vocal exchanges and alarm calls are limited; scent marking with urine is the dominant form of communication. Adult males are highly territorial and are aggressive towards other males. Vocalizations include an affiliative (friendly) call &quot;krik&quot;, and a louder call resembling a crow&#x27;s caw. When disturbed, slow lorises can also produce a low buzzing hiss or growl. To make contact with other individuals, they emit a single high-pitched rising tone, and females use a high whistle when in estrus.
Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers, and often hold on to branches with three of their four limbs. To move between trees, they carefully grip the terminal branches of the neighboring tree and pull themselves across the small gap. They will also grip branches with only their hind feet, lift themselves upright, and quickly launch forward with their hands to catch prey.

Due to their slow movement, all lorises, including the slow lorises, have a specially adapted mechanism for defense against predation. Their slow, deliberate movement hardly disturbs the vegetation and is almost completely silent. Once disturbed, they immediately stop moving and remain motionless. In Indonesia, slow lorises are called &quot;malu malu&quot; or &quot;shy one&quot; because they freeze and cover their face when spotted.

If cornered, they may adopt a defensive posture by curling up and lunging at the predator. The Acehnese name, &quot;buah angin&quot; (&quot;wind monkey&quot;), refers to their ability to &quot;fleetingly but silently escape&quot;. Little is known about the predation of slow lorises. Documented predators include snakes, the changeable hawk-eagle (&quot;Nisaetus cirrhatus&quot;), and Sumatran orangutans (&quot;Pongo abelii&quot;). Other potential predators include cats, sun bears (&quot;Helarctos malayanus&quot;), binturongs (&quot;Arctictis binturong&quot;), and Asian palm civets.

Slow lorises produce a secretion from their brachial gland (a scent gland on the upper arm near the axilla) that is licked and mixed with their saliva. In tests, three predators—binturongs, clouded leopards (&quot;Neofelis nebulosa&quot;), and sun bears—retreated or showed other signs of displeasure when presented with cotton swabs anointed with a mixture of the toxic secretion and the saliva, whereas the toxic secretion alone generated mild interest. Before stashing their offspring in a secure location, female slow lorises will lick their brachial glands, and then groom their young with their toothcomb, depositing the toxin on their fur. When threatened, slow lorises may also lick their brachial glands and bite their aggressors, delivering the toxin into the wounds. Slow lorises can be reluctant to release their bite, which is likely to maximize the transfer of toxins. This toxic bite is a rare trait among mammals and unique to lorisid primates. It may also be used for defense against other slow lorises and parasites. According to Nekaris, this adaptation—along with vocalizations, movement, and coloration patterns similar to those of true cobras—may have evolved through Müllerian mimicry to protect slow lorises when they need to move across the ground due to breaks in the canopy.

The secretion from the brachial gland of captive slow lorises is similar to the allergen in cat dander, hence the secretions may merely elicit an allergic reaction, not toxicosis. Loris bites cause a painful swelling, and the single case of human death reported in the scientific literature was believed to have resulted from anaphylactic shock.

To protect itself, the Slow loris has also been observed to rub the venom on its fur to chemically defend itself from predators.
Studies suggest that slow lorises are polygynandrous. Infants are either parked on branches while their parents find food or else are carried by one of the parents. Due to their long gestations (about six months), small litter sizes, low birth weights, long weaning times (three to six months), and long gaps between births, slow loris populations have one of the slowest growth rates among mammals of similar size. Pygmy slow lorises are likely to give birth to twins—from 50% to 100% of births, depending on the study; in contrast, this phenomenon is rare (3% occurrence) in Bengal slow lorises. A seven-year study of captive-bred pygmy slow lorises showed a skewed sex distribution, with 1.68 males born for every 1 female.

Breeding may be continuous throughout the year. Copulation often occurs while suspended with the hands and feet clinging to horizontal branches for support. In captive Sunda slow lorises, mating primarily occurs between June and mid-September, with the estrus cycle lasting 29 to 45 days and estrus lasting one to five days. Likewise, gestation lasts 185 to 197 days, and the young weigh between at birth. Females reach sexual maturity at 18 to 24 months, while males are capable of reproducing at 17 months. However, the fathers become hostile towards their male offspring after 12 to 14 months and will chase them away. In captivity, they can live 20 or more years.

===Diet===
Slow lorises are omnivores, eating insects and other arthropods, small birds and reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, nectar and miscellaneous vegetation. A 1984 study of the Sunda slow loris indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and other animal prey. A more detailed study of another Sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions, consisting of 43.3% gum, 31.7% nectar, 22.5% fruit, and just 2.5% arthropods and other animal prey. The most common dietary item was nectar from flowers of the Bertram palm (&quot;Eugeissona tristis&quot;). The Sunda slow loris eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell.

Preliminary results of studies on the pygmy slow loris indicate that its diet consists primarily of gums and nectar (especially nectar from &quot;Saraca dives&quot; flowers), and that animal prey makes up 30–40% of its diet. However, one 2002 analysis of pygmy slow loris feces indicated that it contained 98% insect remains and just 2% plant remains. The pygmy slow loris often returns to the same gum feeding sites and leaves conspicuous gouges on tree trunks when inducing the flow of exudates. Slow lorises have been reported gouging for exudates at heights ranging from to as much as ; the gouging process, whereby the loris repetitively bangs its toothcomb into the hard bark, may be loud enough to be heard up to away. The marks remaining after gouging can be used by field workers to assess loris presence in an area.

Captive pygmy slow lorises also make characteristic gouge marks in wooden substrates, such as branches. It is not known how the sympatric pygmy and Bengal slow lorises partition their feeding niches. The plant gums, obtained typically from species in the family Fabaceae (peas), are high in carbohydrates and lipids, and can serve as a year-around source of food, or an emergency reserve when other preferred food items are scarce. Several anatomical adaptations present in slow lorises may enhance their ability to feed on exudates: a long narrow tongue to make it easier to reach gum stashed in cracks and crevices, a large cecum to help the animal digest complex carbohydrates, and a short duodenum to help quickly pass potentially toxic exudates. Slow lorises can use both hands to eat while hanging upside down from a branch. They spend about 20% of their nightly activities feeding.

==In culture==
Beliefs about slow lorises and their use in traditional practices are deep-rooted and go back at least 300 years, if not earlier based on oral traditions. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was reported that the people from the interior of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil. The following passage from an early textbook about primates is indicative of the superstitions associated with slow lorises: Many strange powers are attributed to this animal by the natives of the countries it inhabits; there is hardly an event in life to man, woman or child, or even domestic animals, that may not be influenced for better or worse by the Slow Loris, alive or dead, or by any separate part of it, and apparently one cannot usually tell at the time, that one is under supernatural power. Thus a Malay may commit a crime he did not premeditate, and then find that an enemy had buried a particular part of a Loris under his threshold, which had, unknown to him, compelled him to act to his own disadvantage. ... [a slow loris&#x27;s] life is not a happy one, for it is continually seeing ghosts; that is why it hides its face in its hands.

In the Mondulkiri Province of Cambodia, hunters believe that lorises can heal their own broken bones immediately after falling from a branch so that they can climb back up the tree. They also believe that slow lorises have medicinal powers because they require more than one hit with a stick to die. In the province of North Sumatra, the slow loris is thought to bring good luck if it is buried under a house or a road. In the same province, slow loris body parts were used to place curses on enemies. In Java, it was thought that putting a piece of its skull in a water jug would make a husband more docile and submissive, just like a slow loris in the daytime. More recently, researchers have documented the belief that the consumption of loris meat was an aphrodisiac that improves &quot;male power&quot;. The gall bladder of the Bengal slow loris has historically been used to make ink for tattoos by the village elders in Pursat and Koh Kong Provinces of Cambodia. Loris wine is a traditional Cambodian medicine supposed to alleviate the pain of childbirth, made from a mixture of loris bodies and rice wine.

==Conservation==
The two greatest threats to slow lorises are deforestation and the wildlife trade. Slow lorises have lost a significant amount of habitat, with habitat fragmentation isolating small populations and obstructing biological dispersal. However, despite the lost habitat, their decline is most closely associated with unsustainable trade, either as exotic pets or for traditional medicine.

Each of the slow loris species that had been identified prior to 2012 are currently listed as either &quot;Vulnerable&quot; or &quot;Endangered&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on their Red List. When they were all considered a single species, imprecise population data together with their regular occurrence in Southeast Asian animal markets combined to incorrectly suggest that slow lorises were common. This manifested as incorrect Red List assessments of &quot;Least Concern&quot; as recently as 2000. The three newest species are yet to be evaluated by the IUCN, although each was once thought to be subpopulations of the Bornean slow loris—which was evaluated as &quot;Vulnerable&quot; in 2008. With this division of its range and population, the Bornean slow loris and the three new species face a higher risk of extinction than before.

Since 2007, all slow loris species have been protected from commercial international trade under Appendix I of CITES. Furthermore, local trade is illegal because every nation in which they occur naturally has laws protecting them. Despite their CITES Appendix I status and local legal protection, slow lorises are still threatened by both local and international trade due to problems with enforcement. Surveys are needed to determine existing population densities and habitat viability for all species of slow loris. Connectivity between protected areas is important for slow lorises because they are not adapted to dispersing across the ground over large distances.

Populations of Bengal and Sunda slow lorises are not faring well in zoos. Of the 29 captive specimens in North American zoos in 2008, several are hybrids that cannot breed, while most are past their reproductive years. The last captive birth for these species in North America was in 2001 in San Diego. Pygmy slow lorises are doing better in North American zoos; from the late 1980s (when they were imported) to 2008, the population grew to 74 animals, with most of them born at the San Diego Zoo.

===Wildlife trade===

Until the 1960s, the hunting of slow lorises was sustainable, but due to growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife, slow lorises have been overexploited and are in decline. With the use of modern technology, such as battery-powered searchlights, slow lorises have become easier to hunt because of their eyeshine. Traditional medicine made from loris parts is thought to cure many diseases, and the demand for this medicine from wealthy urban areas has replaced the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris and colleagues (2010) showed that these belief systems were so strong that the majority of respondents expressed reluctance to consider alternatives to loris-based medicines.

Slow lorises are sold locally at street markets but are also sold internationally over the Internet and in pet stores. They are especially popular or trendy in Japan, particularly among women. The reasons for their popularity, according to the Japan Wildlife Conservation Society, are that &quot;they&#x27;re easy to keep, they don&#x27;t cry, they&#x27;re small, and just very cute.&quot;

=== Common misconceptions ===
Because of their &quot;cuteness&quot;, videos of pet slow lorises are some of the most frequently watched animal-related viral videos on YouTube. By March 2011, a newly posted video of a slow loris holding a cocktail umbrella had been viewed more than two million times, while an older video of a slow loris being tickled had been viewed more than six million times. According to Nekaris, these videos are misunderstood by most people who watch them, since most do not realize that it is illegal in most countries to own them as pets and that the slow lorises in the videos are only docile because that is their passive defensive reaction to threatening situations.

Despite frequent advertisements by pet shops in Japan, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre reported that only a few dozen slow lorises were legally imported in 2006, suggesting frequent smuggling. Slow lorises are also smuggled to China, Taiwan, Europe, Russia, the United States, and Saudi Arabia for use as pets.
Within their countries of origin, slow lorises are very popular pets, particularly in Indonesia. They are seen as a &quot;living toy&quot; for children by local people or are bought out of pity by Western tourists or expatriates. Neither local nor foreign buyers usually know anything about these primates, their endangered status, or that the trade is illegal. According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;, slow lorises are protected by both local laws in southern Asia and by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Furthermore, few know about their strong odor or their painful bite, which may lead to anaphylaxis in some cases. According to data compiled from monthly surveys and interviews with local traders, nearly a thousand locally-sourced slow lorises exchanged hands in the Medan bird market in North Sumatra during the late first decade of the 21st century.

International trade usually involves a high mortality rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems due to both local and international trade. In order to give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or cut them off with nail clippers. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death.

Dental infection is common and is fatal in 90% of cases. Without their teeth, the animals can no longer fend for themselves in the wild and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.

As part of the trade, infants are pulled prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin secretions from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises are also stress-sensitive and do not thrive in captivity. Common health problems seen in pet slow lorises include undernourishment, tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are usually asleep when the nocturnal pet is awake.

<text>Several articles in several parts of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany govern elections and establish constitutional requirements such as the secret ballot, and the requirement that all elections be conducted in a free and fair manner. The Basic Law also requires that the federal legislature enact detailed federal laws to govern elections; electoral law(s). One such article is Article 38, regarding the election of deputies in the federal Bundestag. Article 38.2 of the Basic Law establishes universal suffrage: &quot;Any person who has attained the age of eighteen shall be entitled to vote; any person who has attained the age of majority may be elected.&quot;

German federal elections are for all members of the Bundestag, which in turn determines who is the chancellor of Germany. The most recent federal election was held in 2025.

==German elections from 1871 to 1945==

After the unification of Germany under Emperor Wilhelm I in 1871, elections were held to the German Reichstag or Imperial Assembly, which supplanted its namesake, the Reichstag of the North German Confederation. The Reichstag could be dissolved by the emperor or, after the abdication of Wilhelm II in 1918, the president of Germany. With the Weimar Republic&#x27;s Constitution of 1919, the voting system changed from single-member constituencies to proportional representation. The election age was reduced from 25 to 20 years of age. Women&#x27;s suffrage had already been established by a new electoral law in 1918 following the November Revolution of that year.

Following the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, another national election was held on 5 March. This was the last competitive election before World War II, although it was neither free nor fair. Violence and intimidation by the , and had been underway for months against trade-unionists, communists, social democrats, and even centre-right Catholics. On 27 February, just prior to the election, the Reichstag Fire Decree suspended freedom of the press and most civil liberties. Mass arrests followed, including all Communist and several Social Democrat delegates to the Reichstag. 50000 members of the (auxiliary Nazi police) &quot;monitored&quot; polling places on election day to further intimidate voters. While the Nazi Party performed better than it had in the elections of November 1932, it still won only 33% of the vote. By placing their rivals in jail and intimidating others not to take their seats, the Nazis went from a plurality to the majority. Just two weeks after the election, the Enabling Act of 1933 effectively gave Hitler dictatorial power. Three more elections were held in Nazi Germany before the war. They all took the form of a one-question referendum, asking voters to approve a predetermined list of candidates composed exclusively of Nazis and nominally independent &quot;guests&quot; of the party.

==German elections since 1949==

===Federal Republic of Germany===

====Election system====
Federal elections (so called „&quot;Bundestagswahlen&quot;“) are conducted approximately every four years, resulting from the constitutional requirement for elections to be held 46 to 48 months after the assembly of the Bundestag. Elections can be held earlier in exceptional constitutional circumstances: for example, were the Chancellor to lose a vote of confidence in the Bundestag, then, during a grace period before the Bundestag can vote in a replacement Chancellor, the Chancellor could request the Federal President to dissolve the Bundestag and hold elections. Should the Bundestag be dismissed before the four-year period has ended, elections must be held within 100 days. The exact date of the election is chosen by the President and must be a Sunday or public holiday.

German nationals over the age of 18 who have resided in Germany for at least three months are eligible to vote. Eligibility for candidacy is essentially the same.

The federal legislature in Germany has a one chamber parliament—the Bundestag (Federal Diet); the Bundesrat (Federal Council) represents the States (in particular the state Governments) and is not considered a chamber as its members are not elected. The Bundestag is elected using a mixed member proportional system. The Bundestag has 598 nominal members, elected for a four-year term. Half, 299 members, are elected in single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting, while a further 299 members are allocated from party lists to achieve a proportional distribution in the legislature, conducted according to a form of proportional representation called the Mixed member proportional representation system (MMP). Voters vote once for a constituency representative, and a second time for a party, and the lists are used to make the party balances match the distribution of second votes. Overhang seats may add to the nominal number of 598 members: for example, in the 2009 federal election there were 24 overhang seats, giving a total of 622 seats. This is caused by larger parties winning additional single-member constituencies above the totals determined by their proportional party vote.

Germany has a multi-party system with two historically strong political parties and some other third parties also represented in the Bundestag. Since 1990, and including the results of the most recent federal election in 2021, just six main political parties have managed to secure representation in the Bundestag (counting the CDU and CSU as one, and excluding recognised minority group parties such as the SSW which are exempted in federal law from the 5% threshold that is normally required to be breached in order to win party-list seats).

In 2008, some modifications to the electoral system were required under an order of the Federal Constitutional Court. The court had found that a provision in the Federal Election Law made it possible for a party to experience a negative vote weight, thus &quot;losing&quot; seats due to &quot;more&quot; votes, and found that this violated the constitutional guarantee of the electoral system being equal and direct.

The court allowed three years to amend the law. Accordingly, the 2009 federal election was allowed to proceed under the previous system. The changes were due by 30 June 2011, but appropriate legislation was not completed by that deadline. A new electoral law was enacted in late 2011, but declared unconstitutional once again by the Federal Constitutional Court upon lawsuits from the opposition parties and a group of some 4,000 private citizens.

Finally, four of the five factions in the Bundestag agreed on an electoral reform whereby the number of seats in the Bundestag will be increased as much as necessary to ensure that any overhang seats are compensated through apportioned leveling seats, to ensure full proportionality according to the political party&#x27;s share of party votes at the national level. The Bundestag approved and enacted the new electoral reform in February 2013.

=== European elections ===
Every 5 years, Germany, as a founding member of the European Union, votes to select their delegates to the European Parliament. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are elected through a proportional party list system, which, unlike federal elections, do not require a minimum threshold to win seats or constituency seats. The voting age is set at 16.

=== Presidential elections ===
Germans do not directly vote for their President. Instead the President is elected every 5 years by the Federal Convention. All members of Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates elected by the state or &#x27;Länder&#x27; parliaments specifically for this purpose, proportional to their population, comprise the voters of the convention.

===State elections in the Federal Republic of Germany===
State elections are conducted under various rules set by the Länder (states). In general they are conducted according to some form of party-list proportional representation, either the same as the federal system or some simplified version. The election period is generally four to five years, and the dates of elections vary from state to state.

===German Democratic Republic===
In the German Democratic Republic, elections to the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; were effectively controlled by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and state hierarchy, even though multiple &quot;pro forma&quot; parties existed. The 18 March 1990 election were the first free ones held in the GDR, producing a government whose major mandate was to negotiate an end to itself and its state.

Prior to the Fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany did not have free elections. Polling places were under surveillance by the state security apparatuses and the ruling party, the SED, presented voters with a slate of proposed candidates. Voters could optionally enter a booth to strike any candidates the voter did not want; a voter who agreed with the SED&#x27;s full list simply folded the unmarked ballot in half and placed it into the ballot box. Entering a voting booth was considered suspicious and was noted by the state security apparatuses, which could lead to consequences later for the voter. East German voters commonly referred to the act of voting as &quot;folding&quot; (). Election outcomes prior to 1990 commonly saw 99% of voters in favor of the suggested slate of candidates. On top of this, the government engaged in electoral fraud and commonly falsified both results and voter turnout percentages, even as late as the May 1989 municipal elections.

===Local elections===
Local elections in Germany () include elections for most regional and local subdivisions, unless their representatives are appointed or elected by another assembly or office. Such local elections are conducted for representatives in districts, cities, towns, villages and various other administrative regional organizations. In cities and towns local elections usually include voting for a lord mayor or mayor. Smaller villages and settlements may elect a representative () with limited administrative power. Local elections are also often combined with polls about important local matters and questions of general public interest (i.e. the construction of local roads or other infrastructure facilities). While such polls are not legally binding in most cases, their results have considerable influence on local political decisions.

After the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 to strengthen the European integration, Germany and other EU member states implemented legislative changes to grant foreigners of other EU countries the right to vote in local elections in their host country. Foreign EU citizens can vote in elections on district and municipal level in Germany, after the German states adapted their regulations between 1995 and 1998.

<text>Waldomiro Freitas Autran Dourado (1926 – September 30, 2012) was a Brazilian novelist.

Dourado was born in Patos de Minas, state of Minas Gerais. Going against current trends in Brazilian literature, Dourado&#x27;s works display much concern with literary form, with many obscure words and expressions. Minas Gerais is the setting for most of Dourado&#x27;s books, resembling the early to mid-20th century regionalist trend in Brazilian literature. Most literary critics consider Dourado&#x27;s work to have similarities to Baroque literature.

In 1982, Dourado won the Jabuti Prize.

In 2000, Dourado won the Camões Prize, the most important literary prize in the Portuguese language.

In 2001, Brazilian filmmaker Suzana Amaral released the film &quot;Uma Vida em Segredo&quot;. It was based on the novel of same title by Autran Dourado.

Dourado died of stomach bleeding on September 30, 2012, in Rio de Janeiro. He was 86 years old.

<doc id="1264016" wikidata="Q2309250" url="?curid=1264016" title="Meeussen's rule">
<text>Meeussen&#x27;s rule is a special case of tone reduction. It was first described in Bantu languages, but occurs in analyses of other languages as well, such as Papuan languages. The tonal alternation that it describes is the lowering, in some contexts, of the last tone of a pattern of two adjacent high tones (HH), resulting in the pattern HL. The phenomenon is named after its first observer, the Belgian Bantu specialist A. E. Meeussen (1912–1978). In phonological terms, the phenomenon can be seen as a special case of the obligatory contour principle.

The term &quot;Meeussen&#x27;s Rule&quot; (the spelling with a capital &quot;R&quot; is more common) first appeared in a paper by John Goldsmith in 1981. It is based on an observation made by Meeussen in his 1963 article on the Tonga verb stating that &quot;in a sequence of determinants, only the first is treated as a determinant&quot;. John Goldsmith reformulated that as the rule HH &gt; HL (or, as he expressed it, H → L / H     ), which later became well known as Meeussen&#x27;s rule.

Meeussen&#x27;s rule is one of a number of processes in Bantu languages by which a series of consecutive high tones is avoided. The processes result in a less tonal, more accentual character in Bantu tone systems and causes a situation in which there tends to be only one tone per word or morpheme.

==Examples== 
Here are some illustrations of the phenomenon in Kirundi, a Bantu language of Burundi (examples adapted from Philippson 1998).

===In verb forms===
* na-rá-zi-báriira   (I--them.10-to sew)   &#x27;I was sewing them&#x27; (&quot;them&quot; refers to a class 10 plural)
* na-rá-bariira   (I--to sew)   &#x27;I was sewing&#x27;
In the first sentence, both the tense marker &quot;rá&quot; and the verb form &quot;báriira&quot; (to sew) carry a high tone, signified by the acute accent. They are separated by the pronominal marker &quot;zi&quot;. In the second sentence, the pronominal marker &quot;zi&quot; is left out, resulting in two adjacent high tones. The phenomenon described by Meeussen&#x27;s rule causes the second high tone to change into a low tone.

===In noun forms===
* bukéeye &gt; umuɲábukéeye
* mwáaro &gt; umuɲámwaaro
The examples show a way of deriving from place names nouns with the meaning &#x27;a person originating from&#x27;. In the first example, the place name &quot;bukéeye&quot; has a high tone on the second syllable. The junction with &quot;umuɲá&quot; (&#x27;person from&#x27;) has no influence on this tone. In the second example, a place name with a High tone on the first syllable is used. Like above, the second high tone of the resulting pattern of two adjacent high tones is changed into a low tone because of the phenomenon described by Meeussen&#x27;s rule.

===HHH &gt; HLL===
Just as HH (high tone + high tone) can become HL (high tone + low tone) by Meeussen&#x27;s rule, HHH also often becomes HLL, and HHHH becomes HLLL. Thus in Luganda, a Bantu language of Uganda, the word &quot;*bá-lí-lába&quot; &#x27;they will see&#x27;, which theoretically has three High tones, is actually pronounced &quot;bálilabá&quot; with only one. (The tone on the last syllable is an automatically generated phrasal tone; see Luganda tones.)

This process does not operate in the same way in every language, however. For example, in Shona, a Bantu language of Zimbabwe]], the similar verb *á-chá-téngá &#x27;he will buy&#x27; transforms to á-cha-téngá, where only one syllable is lowered by Meeussen&#x27;s rule.

==Exceptions==
Spreading of a tone across two or more syllables is quite common in Bantu languages. Tones that derive from spreading (or from plateauing, the spreading of high pitch from one high tone to another) are not affected by Meeussen&#x27;s rule. Thus, in the Chewa language of Malawi, for example, when the word &quot;kuphíka&quot; &#x27;to cook&#x27; is followed by a direct object such as &quot;nyama&quot; &#x27;meat&#x27;, the tone on the penultimate syllable will spread: &quot;kuphíká nyama&quot; &#x27;to cook meat&#x27;.

There are many other exceptions to Meeussen&#x27;s rule. For example, Shona verbs, in certain circumstances, may have two high tones in adjacent syllables. In the subjunctive &quot;tí-téngésé&quot; &#x27;we should sell&#x27;, both &quot;tí&quot; and &quot;té-&quot; have underlying high tones (the high tones of &quot;-ngésé&quot; arise from tone spreading), yet the tone of &quot;té-&quot; is not deleted. Likewise, in the Chewa verb &quot;a-ná-ká-fótokoza&quot; &#x27;he went and explained&#x27;, the tone of &quot;ká&quot; &#x27;go and&#x27; does not get lowered although it follows the high-toned tense-marker &quot;ná&quot;.

<text>The Order of Suvorov () is a military decoration of the Russian Federation named in honor of Russian Generalissimo Prince Alexander Suvorov (1729–1800).

== History ==
The Order of Suvorov was originally a Soviet award established on July 29, 1942 (during World War II) by decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. It was created to reward senior army personnel for exceptional leadership in combat operations. The Order of Suvorov was divided into three classes: 1st class, 2nd class, and 3rd class. Georgi Zhukov became the first recipient of the Order of Suvorov 1st class on January 28, 1943.

The Order 1st class was awarded to army commanders for exceptional leadership of combat operations. The Order 2nd class was awarded to corps, division, and brigade commanders for a decisive victory over a numerically superior enemy. The Order 3rd class was awarded to regimental commanders, their chiefs of staff, and battalion and company commanders for outstanding leadership leading to a combat victory. Despite its official award criteria, both the first and second classes of the Order were sometimes awarded to defense industry executives, as well as to designers of various weapons and military equipment. Only a dozen non-Russians have received the Order 1st class, including World War II military leaders United States Army Generals George C. Marshall and Dwight D. Eisenhower, British Army Field Marshal Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke and Royal Navy Admiral Sir Robert Burnett.

Following the 1991 dissolution of the USSR, the Order of Suvorov was retained unchanged by Decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation 2557-I of March 20, 1992 but it was not awarded in this form. The all encompassing Presidential Decree 1099 of September 7, 2010 that modernised and reorganised the entire Russian awards system away from its Soviet past changed the statute of the Order to a single-class medal.

In November 2015 all recipient formations in the Armed Forces of Ukraine were stripped of their Order of Suvorov honors as part of the removal of Soviet-era awards under decommunization.

== Award statute ==

The Order of Suvorov is awarded in a single class to formation commanders, their deputies, heads of operational management, of operational departments, chiefs of the army and of special forces of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation: for skilful organization of the operations and management of groups of troops (forces), formations and military units, who managed, despite the stubborn resistance of the enemy, its numerical superiority, better technical equipment and a more favourable location in the theatre of operations to achieve the goals of the operation to keep key areas of its territory (or territory of allied countries), to create conditions for seizing the initiative and conduct further operations with offensive purposes; for skilful organization and management of units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation during events of strategic deterrence, to ensure that no escalation, aggression (conflict) against the Russian Federation and (or) its allies occurs.

May also be awarded for conducting operations on land or in the air, during which, despite the numerical superiority of the enemy, the objectives of the operations were carried out while retaining the full operational capability of military units. May be awarded to foreign citizens – soldiers of allied forces from among the senior officers involved alongside the soldiers of the Russian Federation for organizing and conducting a successful combined operation of allied troops (forces). The Order may be awarded posthumously.

== Award description ==
The Order of Suvorov is a gold-plated cross pattée with silver rays protruding from the center outwards between the arms of the cross to form a square. The distance from the tip of the silver rays to the tip of the opposite rays is 35 mm. The obverse center has a circular convex medallion bearing the gilded bust of Alexander Suvorov, in profile, facing left. Just below the bust of Suvorov, on the medallion lower edge, crossed branches of oak and laurel. At the upper part of the medallion, following its circumference, the inscription in red-enamelled embossed letters &quot;ALEXANDER SUVOROV&quot; (in Russian: АЛЕКСАНДР СУВОРОВ). The reverse is bare except for the award serial number.

The Order is suspended by a ring through the award&#x27;s suspension loop to a standard Russian pentagonal mount covered by a green silk moiré ribbon with a orange central stripe.

The Russian Federation order of precedence dictates that the Order of Suvorov is to be worn on the left side of the chest, and in the presence of other orders of the Russian Federation, is to be located immediately after the Order of Alexander Nevsky.

<doc id="1264020" wikidata="Q5367972" url="?curid=1264020" title="Elva (album)">
<text>Elva is the fourth studio album by the San Diego–based punk rock band Unwritten Law, released in 2002 by Interscope Records. With it the band moved away from their previously established skate punk style, and towards a more accessible alternative rock sound. The band found success with the song &quot;Seein&#x27; Red&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the US Modern Rock Tracks charts. This is the band&#x27;s last studio album to feature founding drummer Wade Youman until their 2022 album, &quot;The Hum&quot;.

==Production==
After touring in support of their Self-Titled Album, the band took time off the road and began working on new material. In an interview with MTV, Ex-Guitarist, Rob Brewer had stated:&quot;It&#x27;s definitely a little different, I can&#x27;t really explain how; it&#x27;s just more of a rock record and there&#x27;s more material. The album will have more complex instrumentation and a more mature vibe than the group&#x27;s past work, We&#x27;re stoked on it, we didn&#x27;t go into the recording studio thinking we need to write another &quot;Cailin&quot;, we believe we have songs that are radio-friendly—we just play what we like and hope everyone else likes it, too&quot;. 

The band had rented a house in Los Angeles where they could hang out and write songs, though according to Brewer, nothing got done:We never went to bed while we were in L.A. the whole time, and there were people partying at our house all the time. It was pretty crazy. We had something like a $15,000 bill from trash and damages. 

They began recording the new album in the summer of 2000 with producer John Shanks, Brewer further explained:&quot;We talked with a bunch of other guys who had done much bigger albums,&quot; &quot;but they didn&#x27;t really take the time to listen to the demos and had no solid input on what they liked or didn&#x27;t like. John was totally different; he really listened to the songs and had some solid ideas. 

The band wrote about 30 songs with only 14 making the cut, two songs that didn’t make the album, &quot;Dark Side&quot; and &quot;Baby, Come On&quot; would end up as b-sides on the &quot;Up All Night&quot; single.

The album was finished, but upon listening to what they had, the band decided to scrap the recordings, go back into the studio, and redo the album with new producers Josh Abraham and Michael Happoldt.

In a 2014 interview, Happoldt recalled the sessions:&quot;Now that was a hybrid because they were on Interscope and there was a lot of pressure and they were used to doing certain things a certain way. So some lines were drawn a little bit there [haha]. But still, I got a lot of soul out of those boys for the condition it was recorded in. You know, huge studios, a lot of pressure from Interscope, but we had a number 1 hit out of that with &quot;Seeing Red&quot;.

&quot;Elva&quot; features guest appearances by Tony Kanal of No Doubt, Josh Freese of The Vandals, and Neville Staple of The Specials. The two &quot;Raleigh Soliloquy&quot; tracks are recordings of the rants of Raleigh Theodore Sakers. Previous recordings of his rants numbered soliloquies I-III had appeared on the Sublime album &quot;Robbin&#x27; the Hood&quot;. After the closing track &quot;Evolution&quot; there is a phone message to singer Scott Russo from Blink-182 singer/guitarist Tom DeLonge, a close friend of the band who had grown up with them in their home town of Poway.

<doc id="1264023" wikidata="Q723373" url="?curid=1264023" title="Alfredo Moreno">
<text>Alfredo David Moreno (12 January 1980 – 8 December 2021) was an Argentine footballer who played as a forward.

==Club career==
Moreno began his career with Boca Juniors, making his debut for the team September 26, 1999. He had a brief but successful stint with the team, scoring 5 goals in the Copa Libertadores 2000 match against Bolivian side Blooming.

At the age of 21, Alfredo Moreno joined Club Necaxa (on loan with the option to buy the player in a definite purchase) for the Verano 2001 season. Moreno&#x27;s debut in Mexico was on January 21, 2001, against Puebla FC. On his third game, he managed to score his first goal on Mexican soil by the virtue of penalty kick. However, in that same game against Club Celaya he was also booked twice and sent off. He scored 6 goals in 472 played for an average of one goal every 78 minutes in a season in which Necaxa failed to qualify for the post-season. The next six months were sort of a drought, for he only scored three goals. Moreno and Necaxa did not make the purchase valid and Moreno was back in Argentina playing for Boca Juniors where he stayed for a year and a half, helping the team to win the 2003 Copa Libertadores de América.

After he left Necaxa, however, Boca Juniors sent Alfredo on loan to China&#x27;s Shandong FC where he had difficulty not only with his football abilities, but also the culture and communication. While in Asia, Moreno said that in training the coach would yell out some indications and someone would have to translate to Spanish. To make things worse, the coach was Russian, so the indications started out in Russian, then Chinese and finally into Spanish. Later on, he joined Lokomotiv of the Russian League where he was for a brief period of one month.

Once again, Moreno would have a second stay with &quot;Los Rayos&quot; for the newly renamed 2003 Apertura where his presence was immediately noticed. In his third game on August 16, 2003, Moreno scored twice to win the game 2–0 against Atlante F.C. In what would be his best season with Necaxa, Alfredo scored 10 times in 20 games (13 starts), but the team slumped in the quarter-finals against the champion Pachuca 4–3 in an aggregate score (Club Necaxa lost 1–3 at home and won 2–1 away). For the next years (Apertura 2004, 2005 and Clausura 2004, 2005 and 2006) Moreno scored 29 goals.
In 2006, he played the Copa Libertadores again, this time with UANL Tigres alongside fellow Necaxa striker Ariel Lopez &quot;El Chupa&quot;. However, both failed to score in two goalless draws against Libertad of Paraguay where Tigres lost in penalty kicks.

As a striker, Moreno ended in Necaxa&#x27;s top ten all-time goal scorers with 49 goals in 136 games player. In the years he has been with Necaxa, they have reached the Liguilla (or postseason) four times, being eliminated by Cruz Azul (Invierno 2001), Pachuca (Apertura 2003 and Apertura 2005) and Tecos UAG (Clausura 2005) and Moreno still couldn&#x27;t find the net in those eight games played.

After much speculation, after three bad seasons and after defending the Rayos jersey for more than five years, Moreno parted ways with Necaxa. On June 11, 2006, Alfredo was transferred alongside Mario Perez to San Luis F.C. during the 2007 Draft. In exchange, Rayos received Angel Reyna and Leonel Olmedo.

In the Apertura tournament of 2007, Moreno was the best goal scorer. In the Apertura 2008 tournament, Moreno was sent to play for Club America. However, after an inconsistent tournament with America scoring 4 goals, he was sent back to Necaxa for the Clausura 2009 tournament where he saw the relegation after he was the only player who sacrificed to maintain Necaxa in the primera division. For the Apertura 2009 and Clausura 2010, Moreno played for San Luis where he showed his level was still intact. For the Apertura 2010, Moreno signed for Atlas de Guadalajara.

==Personal life==
On 30 November 2021, Moreno underwent urgent surgery. Doctors removed an obstruction from his gallbladder and discovered a malignant tumor which spread to his intestines.

Moreno died from intestinal cancer on 8 December 2021, at the age of 41.

<text>South Woodford is a London Underground station in the suburb of South Woodford in east London. It is on the Central line between Snaresbrook and Woodford stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 4.

==History==

The station opened on 22 August 1856 as part of the Eastern Counties Railway branch to Loughton which opened that day. Originally named &quot;George Lane&quot;, the station was renamed twice: &quot;South Woodford (George Lane)&quot; on 5 July 1937; and &quot;South Woodford&quot; on 14 December 1947. The station formed part of the Great Eastern Railway&#x27;s system until that company amalgamated with other railways to create the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. On 5 July 1937 the station was renamed &quot;South Woodford (George Lane)&quot;.

The station was subsequently transferred to form part of London Underground&#x27;s Central line on 14 December 1947 when Central line services were extended from Leytonstone to Woodford. This formed a part of the long planned, and delayed, Eastern Extension of the Central line that was part of the London Passenger Transport Board&#x27;s &quot;New Works Programme&quot; of 1935 – 1940. After transferring to London Underground the &quot;(George Lane)&quot; suffix fell out of use, though it remains on some roundel signs.

During the planning of the Victoria line, route options included a continuation of the line from Walthamstow Central to Woodford or South Woodford stations. However, in 1961, the decision was taken to build only as far as Walthamstow Central.
==The station today==
The station has two entrances, one on each side of the line. George Lane originally crossed the railway tracks with a level crossing immediately to the north of the station, but this was closed and the road split into two when the line was electrified. The footbridge can be used without a ticket as, unusually for stations on the Epping branch, the footbridge is outside the ticket gateline. For some years the station had step-free access to and from the eastbound platform only. The ramp to the westbound platform was installed and opened in March 2019, making the station fully step-free.

==Station improvements==
The station underwent considerable renovations in 2006, 150 years after it opened. Five new CCTV cameras were installed in the station underpass with the intention of improving security as, in addition to the multimillion-pound station refurbishment work being undertaken, crime statistics showed South Woodford station had the highest record of violent crime in Redbridge and the underpass was seen as a security risk, particularly after dark. The rebuilding of the section of westbound platform damaged by fire was also completed and the paint scheme was a mix of white, blue and orange. However, the footbridge over the tracks at the east end was not repainted.

==Services and connections==
South Woodford station is on the Central line between Snaresbrook to the west and Woodford to the east. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3–7 minutes between 07:03 and 22:39 eastbound and between 06:22 and 22:19 westbound.

London Bus routes 179, W12, W13 and W14, and night route N55 serve the station.

<text>&quot;Man Overboard&quot; is a song by the American rock band Blink-182. It was first released on September 2, 2000, through MCA Records as the lead single from the band&#x27;s live album &quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!)&quot; (2000). It is the sole studio recording on the release, and was recorded as a bonus track to help promote its release. The song&#x27;s lyrics, credited to bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge, are about losing their original drummer Scott Raynor to alcohol abuse. In the song, Hoppus repeats the refrain &quot;so sorry it&#x27;s over,&quot; and goes on to highlight occasions in which a friend was too intoxicated to be dependable.

The song was originally written during sessions for the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Enema of the State&quot;. Musically, the song is led by a distinctive bass line, accompanied by melodic guitar riffs and straightforward rock drums. Its songwriting was slow to develop, with the group unable to complete its lyrics in time for placement on the album. At then-label MCA&#x27;s suggestion, the trio re-approached the track for inclusion on the live album. Though the band has never officially confirmed its basis, &quot;Man Overboard&quot; has widely been regarded as a reference to former drummer Raynor, who co-founded Blink-182 and had struggled with alcohol dependency in his last years behind the kit, before being dismissed from the band midway through a 1998 tour.

The single received positive notices from music critics, many of whom have listed it among the band&#x27;s best songs. Its music video—a number-one hit on MTV—was directed by Marcos Siega, and parodies the group&#x27;s past clips with dwarfs in place of the band members. The song was a success on rock charts in North America; it peaked at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, and within the top 20 on Canada&#x27;s rock charts compiled by &quot;RPM&quot;. The song was later included on the band&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. The song is the namesake of the pop punk act Man Overboard.

==Background==
Though officially unconfirmed, &quot;Man Overboard&quot; is generally believed to be written about the group&#x27;s original drummer Scott Raynor, who performed and recorded with the trio between 1992 and 1998. Raynor and guitarist Tom DeLonge first met in school, and later met bassist Mark Hoppus to form Blink-182. In the interim years, the band recorded independent albums and toured frequently, attracting a following at the peak of punk rock&#x27;s mainstream popularity. Though the band was growing successful, tensions between DeLonge/Hoppus and Raynor began to grow evident. Raynor frequently spoke of his desire to return to school, and disagreed with their decision to sign to major-label MCA. He began to struggle with alcohol abuse, which started to affect his performance live. Raynor, interviewed by journalist Joe Shooman for an unofficial band biography, admitted that his behavior in this era was &quot;irresponsible [...] I was drinking way too much.&quot; In one instance, Raynor broke both of his heels in an episode while inebriated, and was forced to record the band&#x27;s major-label debut, &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; (1997), while on crutches. Eventually, DeLonge and Hoppus phoned Raynor, issuing an ultimatum that he agree to attend an in-patient rehabilitation facility, or be removed from the band. Raynor agreed to do so, but was still dismissed from the group. He later conceded to Shooman that the duo were &quot;right to fire him,&quot; though it caused him great grief at the time.

The band would minimize the impact of the situation in future interviews and as of 2023, still remain vague regarding his departure. Blink-182 resumed with new drummer Travis Barker, formerly of the Aquabats, at the helm. &quot;Man Overboard&quot;—named for the exclamation made when a passenger falls from a ship—was first demoed for the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Enema of the State&quot;. It was written by Hoppus, and credited to both he and DeLonge. Barker contributed on drums, though was at this point in their career considered a touring musician and did not receive songwriting credit. Its songwriting process went unfinished, as the group had issues with its lyrics and harmonies. After completing &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, they simply decided to return to the idea another time. The following year, the band&#x27;s label, MCA Records, requested they record a new song as a bonus track and single to promote their forthcoming live album, &quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!)&quot;. The trio found it natural to re-approach &quot;Man Overboard&quot;, which was completed in mid-2000 with producer Jerry Finn. It was recorded at Signature Sound in the band&#x27;s hometown of San Diego, California, with Sean O&#x27;Dwyer serving as recording engineer. Lastly, it was mixed by Tom Lord-Alge and mastered by Brian Gardner at his studio in Hollywood.

==Composition==

The song opens with a distinctive solo ostinato on bass guitar performed by Hoppus, preceding a refrain that repeats the phrase &quot;so sorry it&#x27;s over.&quot; As the song begins, Tom DeLonge contributes melodic guitar lines while Barker energetically drums. According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, &quot;Man Overboard&quot; is written in common time with a fast tempo of 192 beats per minute. Set in the key of G major, it follows the chord progression of G–G5–A–C5 for the intro, a series of G–Em–C in the verses, and G5–E5–C5–G5 progression for the choruses. Hoppus and DeLonge&#x27;s vocal parts span from F4 to G5.

Stereogum contributor Pranav Trewn observes that the song lyrically presents a &quot;conflicted account out of two unambiguous narratives.&quot; Throughout the song, Hoppus alludes to the loss of a friend to alcoholism, recalling their tendency to down &quot;shots without a chaser,&quot; and decrying them as &quot;out of line, and rarely sober.&quot; Trewn writes that Hoppus switches between &quot;remorseful affection and cold bitterness&quot; toward the song&#x27;s subject, suggesting that while he commiserates with this friend, DeLonge is more outwardly disdainful. DeLonge&#x27;s portions, serving as backup vocals, claim &quot;there&#x27;s so much more&quot; the duo wanted from the subject. The song concludes with the understanding that Hoppus fails to miss this person&#x27;s presence, demanding this friend &quot;hand in [their] resignation.&quot;

==Music video==

The music video was directed by Marcos Siega. The band first met Siega coming up in the punk rock scene, and their similar ethos led them to hire him in the past for the music videos for &quot;All the Small Things&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot;. In the &quot;Man Overboard&quot; clip, the trio—sleeping in a tour van speeding overnight—each have nightmares that take place in their past music videos (&quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; for Hoppus, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Song&quot; for DeLonge and &quot;All the Small Things&quot; for Barker), in which persons of short stature play their parts. These shots are intercut with clips of the band performing live, filmed at the Belly-Up Tavern in Solana Beach, California. The band had previously utilized a cast of little people for its performance at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards on September 7, 2000. The band was subsequently touring in Europe when Barker suggested they employ the same actors for their next video. Hoppus proposed it would be humorous if the actors replicate the band&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; music video, in which the three ran naked through the streets of Los Angeles. This was parlayed into a full-on parody of their past music videos, starring little people in the roles of the bandmembers, who themselves played extras in the video. The band phoned Siega, who liked the idea and wrote its treatment. They also hired an artist to re-create DeLonge and Barker&#x27;s tattoos on the actors.

Despite the song&#x27;s more serious subject matter, the band hoped to provide an entertaining video, in line with their humorous personas. The video was shot between September 18–24, 2000 in Los Angeles and San Diego. Hoppus&#x27;s mother makes a cameo in the concert pit at the Belly-Up. It was first added to MTV rotation for the week ending October 8, 2000, and to the playlist of the Box and Canadian channel MuchMusic the following weeks. It became MTV&#x27;s most-played clip for the week ending October 22, surpassing videos by acts such as the Backstreet Boys and Christina Aguilera. Aiding in the clip&#x27;s popularity was a half-hour special taking viewers behind the scenes of its production. This special, &quot;Making the Video: Man Overboard&quot;, first premiered on October 18, 2000.

==Commercial performance==
The song debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks ranking at number 31 in the issue dated September 30, 2000. &quot;Billboard&quot; designated it with the signifier &quot;Airpower&quot; in the following issue, denoting heavy airplay rotation. It rose steadily over the following weeks to reach a peak of number two on November 18, 2000, its eighth week on the chart. It was held out of the top spot by &quot;Hemorrhage (In My Hands)&quot;, a single by fellow American rockers Fuel. It last appeared on the ranking in the issue dated February 24, 2001, after which it fell out of the top 40. In Canada, it peaked at number 19 in its third week on the Top 30 Rock Report, a listing compiled by the magazine &quot;RPM&quot;. Outside of North America, &quot;Man Overboard&quot; charted in two locations. In Australia, the song reached number 40 on its national ARIA Charts, while in New Zealand, the song ranked number 49.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Man Overboard&quot; was first alluded to in an August 2000 article on MTV.com, which reported the band were back in the studio to record a studio track accompanying its new live album, &quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!)&quot;. The song debuted online, streaming exclusively on MTV.com, the website for L.A.-based radio station KROQ-FM and the band&#x27;s official site on September 2, 2000. The song was later serviced to radio on September 18 of that year. A maxi CD single for the song was issued on December 5, 2000. Its release prompted fans to speculate about whether or not it was referring to Raynor. Raynor, in the Shooman interview, claims to have never listened to the song. A live version of the song was initially slated as a bonus track for the band&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation, but was left off.

Original reviews of the song were positive. An uncredited &quot;Billboard&quot; writer, reviewing the single, complimented the song&#x27;s &quot;infectious&quot; guitar riff and Barker&#x27;s &quot;aggressive&quot; percussion, suggesting its potential to crossover between multiple radio formats. Natalie Nichols of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; characterized it as a &quot;brash-yet-pretty heartbreak anthem.&quot; Stereogum contributor Pranav Trewn extolled it as among the band&#x27;s best songs, commenting that its structure is &quot;composed solely of hooks. There&#x27;s not a single section that couldn&#x27;t function as the song&#x27;s center, with one of Hoppus&#x27; all-time best bass lines reigning most identifiable as a chorus.&quot; Consequence of Sound, in a 2015 top 10 of the band&#x27;s best songs, ranked it as number three, with writer Randall Colburn calling it &quot;triumphant&quot;: &quot;Such straight-faced commentary on friendship was fairly uncharted territory for Blink at the time, and that &quot;Man Overboard&quot; transcends the band&#x27;s relationship with Raynor speaks to the strength of the songwriting. It&#x27;s also one of the finest displays of one of Blink&#x27;s more indelible musical touches: Hoppus&#x27; bass.&quot;

<doc id="1264043" wikidata="Q1836186" url="?curid=1264043" title="The Triumphs of Oriana">
<text>The Triumphs of Oriana is a book of English madrigals, compiled and published in 1601 by Thomas Morley, which first edition has 25 pieces by 23 composers (Thomas Morley and Ellis Gibbons have two madrigals) for 5 and 6 voices. The first 14 madrigals are for 5vv, the last 11 for 6vv. It was said to have been made to honour Queen Elizabeth I. Every madrigal in the collection contains the following couplet at the end: “Then sang the shepherds and nymphs of Diana: long live fair Oriana” (the word &quot;Oriana&quot; often being used to refer to Queen Elizabeth) though some of the composers wrote variants of this refrain.

It is based on Il Trionfo di Dori by Italian composer Angelo Gardano.

Recently, the attribution of &quot;Oriana&quot; to Elizabeth has come into question. Evidence has been presented that &quot;Oriana&quot; actually refers to Anne of Denmark, who would become Queen of England alongside James VI of Scotland (later James I of England) in an apparently failed early attempt to remove Elizabeth in order to restore England to Catholicism. In his book &#x27;The English Madrigalists&#x27;, Edmund Fellowes, the most prolific of madrigal editors of the earlier 20th century, disapproved of the theory.

==&quot;Choral Songs in Honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria&quot; (1899)==

In 1899, at the instigation of Sir Walter Parratt, Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music, 13 British composers contributed songs to a collection modeled on &quot;The Triumphs of Oriana&quot;, entitled &quot;Choral Songs in Honour of Her Majesty Queen Victoria&quot;, published on the occasion of Victoria&#x27;s 80th birthday.

==&quot;A Garland for the Queen&quot; (1953)==
A Garland for the Queen, a compilation along similar lines, containing pieces by ten composers, was published to mark the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

<text>Brad Clark (born 1960) is a Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. Clark served as the Ward 9 Hamilton City Councillor from December 2006 to December 2014 and again from December 2018 onward. Prior to this, he was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2003, and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.

==Background==
Clark was educated at Mohawk College in Hamilton, receiving a diploma in radio broadcasting. He owned and operated a small business after his graduation, and also served as executive director of the Songwriters Association of Canada. In June 2004, Clark began co-hosting a weekly program on aging on CHML radio.

==Politics==
In the provincial election of 1999, he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the suburban Hamilton riding of Stoney Creek. He defeated Liberal candidate Chris Phillips by about 2,500 votes. On February 8, 2001, he was appointed as the province&#x27;s Minister of Transportation. When Ernie Eves succeeded Mike Harris as Premier on April 15, 2002, he named Clark as his Minister of Labour.

Clark was initially favoured for re-election in the provincial election of 2003 against Liberal candidate Tony Magnini. Magnini was forced to resign in mid-campaign amid allegations of fraud, however, and the Liberals were able to convince Jennifer Mossop, a popular local journalist, to take his place. She defeated Clark by over 5,000 votes. In 2004, he endorsed Frank Klees&#x27;s bid to lead the Ontario Progressive Conservatives.

On November 13, 2006, Clark beat out incumbent city councillor Phil Bruckler by a narrow margin for a seat on the Hamilton City Council to represent Ward 9, which includes the mountain and heritage areas of Stoney Creek. In the federal election of 2011 Clark ran against and was defeated by NDP incumbent Wayne Marston in the riding of Hamilton East—Stoney Creek. He did not step down from council when running for this political position.

In the Hamilton Municipal Election of 2014, Clark ran for the mayoralty of the city. He placed second, being defeated by former Hamilton Mayor Fred Eisenberger. This ended his term as a city councillor when the new council was sworn in late in December 2014.

Clark was returned to the office of Ward 9 city councillor in 2018 and re-elected in 2022.

<text>Music in High Places is a live album by the San Diego–based rock band Unwritten Law, released in 2003 by Earth Escapes. It was recorded live for the VH1 program &quot;Music in High Places&quot; and features the band performing acoustic renditions of their songs in various natural settings in Yellowstone National Park (with the exception of &quot;Shallow,&quot; which was recorded acoustically in the studio). The version of &quot;Rest of My Life&quot; from this recording was released as a music video and reached No. 16 on US modern rock charts. The album peaked at No. 134 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Most of the songs performed are from the band&#x27;s preceding two albums, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Unwritten Law&quot; and 2002&#x27;s &quot;Elva&quot;. It would be the band&#x27;s final recording with founding drummer Wade Youman, who was ejected from the band shortly after, due to personal and professional issues, until he was reinstated in 2013 though he eventually quit the band again in 2019.

<doc id="1264057" wikidata="Q572430" url="?curid=1264057" title="Capella University">
<text>Capella University is a private for-profit, online university headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The school is owned by the publicly traded Strategic Education, Inc. and delivers most of its education online.

Capella has 47 degree programs with over 1,600 online courses. Approximately 41,401 students are enrolled from all 50 states and 51 other countries, with 18 percent enrolled in doctoral programs, 45 percent enrolled in master&#x27;s programs, and 35 percent enrolled in bachelor&#x27;s programs.

==History==
Capella University was originally established as The Graduate School of America by Dr. Harold Abel and Stephen Shank in 1993. Shank was the former CEO of Tonka. Abel, formerly the president of Castleton State College, Central Michigan University, and Walden University, became the first president of the institution.

In 1997, Capella University received regional accreditation. Two years later the parent company and university were renamed Capella Education Company and Capella University, respectively. In 2000, Capella began to offer bachelor&#x27;s degree programs.

In 2005, Capella Education Company announced its intention to go public with an initial public offering. In 2006, they became a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: CPLA), raising $80 million with the offering.

In 2007, Capella was named one of 86 higher education institutions in the United States to have received the National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) designation by the National Security Agency (NSA). The designation was valid for the academic years 2007 through 2012.

In March 2008, Capella Education Company, longtime occupant of the 225 South Sixth skyscraper in downtown Minneapolis, signed a new lease that expanded its office and renamed the building Capella Tower. The building houses all of the company&#x27;s 1,150 downtown Minneapolis administrative staff.

In 2009, The Project Management Institute (PMI) Global Accreditation Center for Project Management (GAC) accredited two Capella University online degree programs: the MS in Information Technology with a specialization in Project Management; and the BS in Information Technology with a specialization in Project Management. It also launched its School of Public Service Leadership.

In 2010, Capella, along with three other schools, was awarded the CHEA Award for Outstanding Institutional Practice in Student Learning Outcomes by The Council for Higher Education Accreditation.

In August 2018, Capella University&#x27;s parent company Capella Education merged with Strayer Education Inc. to form Strategic Education, Inc.

In 2019, Capella added learning sites in Atlanta, Georgia and Orlando, Florida.

Capella began a partnership with Optum in August 2023 to launch an educational program for nursing. In September 2023, Constance St. Germain was appointed to be President of Capella University.

==Academics==

According to College Navigator, Capella&#x27;s faculty comprises 207 full-time instructors and 1,321 part-time instructors.

Undergraduate applicants who do not have any credits eligible for transfer must complete a university-approved examination to be considered for admission.

Capella&#x27;s enrollment is composed mainly of graduate students, including 45 percent MS/MBA students and 18 percent PhD/PsyD doctoral students. The undergraduate population of Capella makes up 35 percent of the student body. Less than one percent are working on certificate programs. The average age of a Capella student is 37. Ninety-five percent of students are enrolled part-time, 86 percent are female, and 53 percent are ethnic minorities.

Capella allows a limited number of credits to be earned through a prior learning assessment program, which can provide college credit for past experiences.

===Accreditation===
Capella University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Baccalaureate and graduate level teacher education programs are accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education. The graduate level counseling program is accredited by The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). Baccalaureate and graduate level nursing programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. Baccalaureate and graduate level business programs have been accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs since 2014. Baccalaureate level information technology programs have been accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc (ABET). In 2024, the American Psychological Association (APA) accredited Capella’s online MS Clinical Psychology program. 

==Controversies==
===U.S. Department of Education compliance audit===
In 2006, the United States Department of Education, Office of the Inspector General (OIG) began a compliance audit of Capella. OIG focused on the university&#x27;s policies and procedures concerning the return of Title IV funds as required by Federal Law for students who failed to give official notice that they were withdrawing from the school. The OIG found that Capella made accounting mistakes in how it calculated student eligibility for government-subsidized loans, including failing to return all funds disbursed on behalf of students who dropped out before their first day of class. Capella, in a response to the audit, says it recognizes some past shortcomings in its accounting practices and has made changes to ensure that such errors are not repeated.
===Criticism of marketing expenses and executive compensation===
In 2012, Capella received criticism for its expenditures on marketing, profit, and CEO pay rather than instruction, and its use of aggressive recruiting practices. According to a report issued by former U.S. Senator Tom Harkin for the Senate Education Committee, approximately 79% of the institution&#x27;s cash flow comes from US government Title IV payments, including Pell grants. The report concluded that Capella&#x27;s recruiting and student services were better managed than most other for-profit competitors, especially among graduate degree students. The high withdrawal rate among Bachelor&#x27;s student hopefuls, the over-reliance on part-time instructors, and the high relative marketing budget were cited as potential causes for concern.

===Class-action lawsuit===
In 2018, a lawsuit was filed against Capella in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging that the school &quot;violated doctoral students&#x27; rights by creating a process intended to ensure that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for students to timely complete, or complete at all, their doctoral programs.&quot; The school rejected the lawsuit&#x27;s claims, stating that the court had thrown out the majority of the legal claims. In 2022, the class action was resolved through private mediation with terms not disclosed.

===Alleged fraud regarding student loans===
Capella University was one of 153 institutions in student loan cancellation due to alleged fraud. The class action was brought by a group of more than 200,000 student borrowers, assisted by the Project on Predatory Student Lending, part of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School. A settlement was approved in August 2022, stating that the schools on the list included &quot;substantial misconduct by the listed schools, whether credibly alleged or in some instances proven.&quot; In April 2023, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the settlement and allowed to proceed the debt cancellation due to alleged fraud.

<doc id="1264072" wikidata="Q12970" url="?curid=1264072" title="Capella">
<text>Capella is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Auriga. It has the Bayer designation α Aurigae, which is Latinised to Alpha Aurigae and abbreviated Alpha Aur or α Aur. Capella is the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, and the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere after Arcturus and Vega. A prominent object in the northern winter sky, it is circumpolar to observers north of 44°N. Its name meaning &quot;little goat&quot; in Latin, Capella depicted the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus in classical mythology. Capella is relatively close, at from the Sun. It is one of the brightest X-ray sources in the sky, thought to come primarily from the corona of Capella Aa.

Although it appears to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is actually a quadruple star system organized in two binary pairs, made up of the stars Capella Aa, Capella Ab, Capella H and Capella L. The primary pair, Capella Aa and Capella Ab, are two bright-yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. The secondary pair, Capella H and Capella L, are around 10,000 astronomical units (AU) from the first and are two faint, small and relatively cool red dwarfs.

Capella Aa and Capella Ab have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and expanded, moving off the main sequence. They are in a very tight circular orbit about 0.74 AU apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun&#x27;s luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius. An aging red clump star, it is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core. Capella Ab is slightly smaller and hotter and of spectral class G1III; it is 72.7 ± 3.6 times as luminous as the Sun and 8.83 ± 0.33 times its radius. It is in the Hertzsprung gap, corresponding to a brief subgiant evolutionary phase as it expands and cools to become a red giant. Several other stars in the same visual field have been catalogued as companions but are physically unrelated.

==Nomenclature==

&quot;α Aurigae&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Aurigae&quot;) is the star system&#x27;s Bayer designation. It also has the Flamsteed designation 13 Aurigae. It is listed in several multiple star catalogues as ADS 3841, CCDM J05168+4559, and WDS J05167+4600. As a relatively nearby star system, Capella is listed in the Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue with designations GJ 194 for the bright pair of giants and GJ 195 for the faint pair of red dwarfs.

The traditional name &quot;Capella&quot; is Latin for &quot;(small) female goat&quot;; the alternative name &quot;Capra&quot; was more commonly used in classical times. It is the translation of the Greek star name Aἴξ (aix) meaning &quot;the Goat&quot;. As the sound of the Greek term for the goat (aἴξ) is similar to the sound of the name for the Aegaean Sea, this star has been used for weather rules and determining the seasonal wind direction. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Capella&quot; for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. The catalogue of star names lists &quot;Capella&quot; as applying to the star α Aurigae Aa.

==Observational history==
Capella was the brightest star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude. At −1.1, Aldebaran was brightest before this period; it and Capella were situated rather close to each other in the sky and approximated boreal pole stars at the time.
Capella is thought to be mentioned in an Akkadian inscription dating to the 20th century BC. Its goat-associated symbolism dates back to Mesopotamia as a constellation called &quot;GAM&quot;, &quot;Gamlum&quot; or &quot;MUL.GAM&quot; in the 7th-century BC document MUL.APIN. GAM represented a scimitar or crook and may have represented the star alone or the constellation of Auriga as a whole. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. It is sometimes called the &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Star&quot; in English literature. Capella was seen as a portent of rain in classical times.

Building J of the pre-Columbian site Monte Albán in Oaxaca state in Mexico was built around 275 BC, at a different orientation to other structures in the complex. Its steps are aligned perpendicular to the rising of Capella at that time, so that a person looking out a doorway on the building would have faced it directly. Capella is significant as its heliacal rising took place within a day of the Sun passing directly overhead over Monte Albán.

===Multiple status===
Professor William Wallace Campbell of the Lick Observatory announced that Capella was binary in 1899, based on spectroscopic observations—he noted on photographic plates taken from August 1896 to February 1897 that a second spectrum appeared superimposed over the first, and that there was a doppler shift to violet in September and October and to red in November and February—showing that the components were moving toward and away from the Earth (and hence orbiting each other). Almost simultaneously, British astronomer Hugh Newall had observed its composite spectrum with a four prism spectroscope attached to a telescope at Cambridge in July 1899, concluding that it was a binary star system.

Many observers tried to discern the component stars without success. Known as &quot;The Interferometrist&#x27;s Friend&quot;, it was first resolved interferometrically in 1919 by John Anderson and Francis Pease at Mount Wilson Observatory, who published an orbit in 1920 based on their observations. This was the first interferometric measurement of any object outside the Solar System. A high-precision orbit was published in 1994 based on observations by the Mark III Stellar Interferometer, again at Mount Wilson Observatory. Capella also became the first astronomical object to be imaged by a separate element optical interferometer when it was imaged by the Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope in September 1995.

In 1914, Finnish astronomer Ragnar Furuhjelm observed that the spectroscopic binary had a faint companion star, which, as its proper motion was similar to that of the spectroscopic binary, was probably physically bound to it. In February 1936, Carl L. Stearns observed that this companion appeared to be double itself; this was confirmed in September that year by Gerard Kuiper. This pair are designated Capella H and L.

===X-ray source===
Two Aerobee-Hi rocket flights on September 20, 1962, and March 15, 1963, detected and confirmed an X-ray source in Auriga at RA Dec , identified as Capella. A major milestone in stellar X-ray astronomy happened on April 5, 1974, with the detection of the strongest emission of X-rays up to that time from Capella, measured at more than 10,000 times the x-ray luminosity of the Sun. A rocket flight on that date briefly calibrated its attitude control system when a star sensor pointed the payload axis at Capella. During this period, X-rays in the range 0.2–1.6 keV were detected by an X-ray reflector system co-aligned with the star sensor.

The X-ray luminosity (&quot;L&quot;x) of ~1024 W (1031 erg s−1) is four orders of magnitude above the Sun&#x27;s X-ray luminosity. Capella&#x27;s X-rays are thought to be primarily from the corona of the most massive star. Capella is ROSAT X-ray source 1RXS J051642.2+460001. The high temperature of Capella&#x27;s corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 would require magnetic confinement, unless it is a free-flowing coronal wind.

==Observation==

With an average apparent magnitude of +0.08, Capella is the brightest object in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest visible to the naked eye from the latitude 40°N. It appears to be a rich yellowish-white colour, although the yellow colour is more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky.

Capella is closer to the north celestial pole than any other first-magnitude star. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom and Canada (except for part of Southern Ontario), most of Europe, and the northernmost fringes of the contiguous United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are on opposite sides of the pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between Orion&#x27;s Belt and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the northern winter sky.

A few degrees to the southwest of Capella lie three stars, Epsilon Aurigae, Zeta Aurigae and Eta Aurigae, the latter two of which are known as &quot;The Kids&quot;, or Haedi. The four form a familiar pattern, or asterism, in the sky.

==Distance==
Based on an annual parallax shift of 76.20 milliarcseconds (with a margin of error of 0.46 milliarcseconds) as measured by the Hipparcos satellite, this system is estimated to be from Earth, with a margin of error of 0.3 light-year (0.09 parsec). An alternative method to determine the distance is via the orbital parallax, which gives a distance of with a margin of error of only 0.1%. Capella is estimated to have been a little closer to the Solar System in the past, passing within 29 light-years distant around 237,000 years ago. At this range, it would have shone at apparent magnitude −0.82, comparable to Canopus today.

In a 1960 paper, American astronomer Olin J. Eggen concluded that Capella was a member of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster, after analysing its proper motion and parallax. Members of the group are of a similar age, and those that are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the main sequence after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and are expanding and cooling into red giants.

==Stellar system==

There are several stars within a few arcminutes of Capella and some have been listed as companions in various multiple star catalogues. The Washington Double Star Catalog lists components A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and R, with A being the naked-eye star. Most are only line-of-sight companions, but the close pair of red dwarfs H and L are at the same distance as the bright component A and moving through space along with it. Capella A is itself a spectroscopic binary with components Aa and Ab, both giant stars. The pair of giants is separated from the pair of red dwarfs by 723&quot;.

American astronomer Robert Burnham Jr. described a scale model of the system where Capella A was represented by spheres 13 and 7 inches across, separated by ten feet. The red dwarfs were then each 0.7 inch across and they were separated by 420 feet. At this scale, the two pairs are 21 miles apart.

===Capella A===

Capella A consists of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104.02128 ± 0.00016 days, with a semimajor axis of 111.11 ± 0.10 million km (0.74272 ± 0.00069 AU), roughly the distance between Venus and the Sun. The pair is not an eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes in front of the other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.

Modern convention designates the more luminous cooler star as component Aa and its spectral type has been usually measured between G2 and K0. The hotter secondary Ab has been given various spectral types of late (cooler) F or early (warmer) G. The MK spectral types of the two stars have been measured a number of times, and they are both consistently assigned a luminosity class of III indicating a giant star. The composite spectrum appears to be dominated by the primary star due to its sharper absorption lines; the lines from the secondary are broadened and blurred by its rapid rotation. The composite spectral class is given as approximately G3III, but with a specific mention of features due to a cooler component. The most recent specific published types are K0III and G1III, although older values are still widely quoted such as G5IIIe + G0III from the Bright Star Catalogue or G8III + G0III by Eggen. Where the context is clear, these two components have been referred to as A and B.

The individual apparent magnitudes of the two component stars cannot be directly measured, but their relative brightness has been measured at various wavelengths. They have very nearly equal brightness in the visible light spectrum, with the hotter secondary component generally being found to be a few tenths of a magnitude brighter. A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.

The physical properties of the two stars can be determined with high accuracy. The masses are derived directly from the orbital solution, with Aa being and Ab being . Their angular radii have been directly measured; in combination with the very accurate distance, this gives and for Aa and Ab, respectively. Their surface temperatures can be calculated by comparison of observed and synthetic spectra, direct measurement of their angular diameters and brightnesses, calibration against their observed colour indices, and disentangling of high resolution spectra. Weighted averages of these four methods give 4,970 ± 50 K for Aa and 5,730 ± 60 for Ab. Their bolometric luminosities are most accurately derived from their apparent magnitudes and bolometric corrections, but are confirmed by calculation from the temperatures and radii of the stars. Aa is 78.7 ± 4.2 times as luminous as the Sun and Ab 72.7 ± 3.6 times as luminous, so the star defined as the primary component is the more luminous when all wavelengths are considered but very slightly less bright at visual wavelengths.

Estimated to be 590 to 650 million years old, the stars were probably at the hot end of spectral class A during their main-sequence lifetime, similar to Vega. They have now exhausted their core hydrogen and evolved off the main sequence, their outer layers expanding and cooling. Despite the giant luminosity class, the secondary component is very clearly within the Hertzsprung gap on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, still expanding and cooling towards the red giant branch, making it a subgiant in evolutionary terms. The more massive primary has already passed through this stage, when it reached a maximum radius of 36 to 38 times that of the Sun. It is now a red clump star which is fusing helium to carbon and oxygen in its core, a process that has not yet begun for the less massive star. Detailed analysis shows that it is nearing the end of this stage and starting to expand again which will lead it to the asymptotic giant branch. Isotope abundances and spin rates confirm this evolutionary difference between the two stars. Heavy element abundances are broadly comparable to those of the Sun and the overall metallicity is slightly less than the Sun&#x27;s.

The rotational period of each star can be measured by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a standard measure and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1 ± 0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0 ± 0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.

Capella has long been suspected to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than Rigel, Betelgeuse and Vega, which are also variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, but it is still only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.

The active atmospheres and closeness of these stars means that they are among the brightest X-ray sources in the sky. However the X-ray emission is due to stable coronal structures and not eruptive flaring activity. Coronal loops larger than the Sun and with temperatures of several million kelvin are likely to be responsible for the majority of the X-rays.

===Capella HL===
The seventh companion published for Capella, component H, is physically associated with the bright primary star. It is a red dwarf separated from the pair of G-type giants by a distance of around . It has its own close companion, an even fainter red dwarf that was 1.8″ away when it was discovered in 1935. It is component L in double star catalogues. In 2015 the separation had increased to 3.5″, which was sufficient to allow &quot;tentative&quot; orbital parameters to be derived, 80 years after its discovery. The Gliese-Jahreiss Catalogue of nearby stars designates the binary system as GJ 195. The two components are then referred to individually as GJ 195 A and B.

The two stars are reported to have a 3.5-visual-magnitude difference (2.3 mag in the passband of the &quot;Gaia&quot; spacecraft) although the difference is much smaller at infrared wavelengths. This is unexpected and may indicate further unseen companions.

The mass of the stars can, in principle, be determined from the orbital motion, but uncertainties in the orbit have led to widely varying results. In 1975, an eccentric 388-year orbit gave masses of and . A smaller near-circular orbit published in 2015 had a 300-year orbit, benefitting from mass constraints of and , respectively, for GJ 195 A and B, based on their infrared magnitudes.

===Visual companions===
Six visual companions to Capella were discovered before Capella H and are generally known only as Capella B through G. None are thought to be physically associated with Capella, although all appear closer in the sky than the HL pair.




Component F is also known as TYC  3358-3142-1. It is listed with a spectral type of K although it is included in a catalogue of OB stars as a distant luminous star.

Component G is BD+45 1076, with a spectral type of F0, at a distance of . It is identified as a variable member of the Guide Star Catalogue from Chandra observations although it is not known what type of variability. It is known to be an X-ray source with an active corona.

Several other stars have also been catalogued as companions to Capella. Components I, Q and R are 13th-magnitude stars at distances of 92″, 133″ and 134″. V538 Aurigae and its close companion HD 233153 are red dwarfs ten degrees away from Capella; they have very similar space motions but the small difference makes it possible that this is just a coincidence. Two faint stars have been discovered by speckle imaging in the Capella HL field, around 10″ distant from that pair. These have been catalogued as Capella O and P. It is not known whether they are physically associated with the red dwarf binary.

==Etymology and culture==
Capella traditionally marks the left shoulder of the constellation&#x27;s eponymous charioteer, or, according to the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, the goat that the charioteer is carrying. In Bayer&#x27;s 1603 work &quot;Uranometria&quot;, Capella marks the charioteer&#x27;s back. The three &quot;Haedi&quot; had been identified as a separate constellation by Pliny the Elder and Manilius, and were called &quot;Capra&quot;, &quot;Caper&quot;, or &quot;Hircus&quot;, all of which relate to its status as the &quot;goat star&quot;. Ptolemy merged the Charioteer and the Goats in the 2nd-century &quot;Almagest&quot;.

In Greek mythology, the star represented the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus. It was this goat whose horn, after accidentally being broken off by Zeus, was transformed into the cornucopia, or &quot;horn of plenty&quot;, which would be filled with whatever its owner desired. Though most often associated with Amalthea, Capella has sometimes been associated with Amalthea&#x27;s owner, a nymph. The myth of the nymph says that the goat&#x27;s hideous appearance, resembling a Gorgon, was partially responsible for the Titans&#x27; defeat, after Zeus skinned the goat and wore it as his aegis.

In medieval accounts, it bore the uncommon name &quot;Alhajoth&quot; (also spelled &quot;Alhaior&quot;, &quot;Althaiot&quot;, &quot;Alhaiset&quot;, &quot;Alhatod&quot;, &quot;Alhojet&quot;, &quot;Alanac&quot;, &quot;Alanat&quot;, &quot;Alioc&quot;), which (especially the last) may be a corruption of its Arabic name, , &quot;al-cayyūq.&quot; &quot;cAyyūq&quot; has no clear significance in Arabic, but may be an Arabized form of the Greek αίξ &quot;aiks&quot; &quot;goat&quot;; cf. the modern Greek Αίγα &quot;Aiga&quot;, the feminine of goat. To the Bedouin of the Negev and Sinai, Capella &quot;al-&#x27;Ayyūq ath-Thurayyā&quot; &quot;Capella of the Pleiades&quot;, from its role as pointing out the position of that asterism. Another name in Arabic was &quot;Al-Rākib&quot; &quot;the driver&quot;, a translation of the Greek.

To the ancient Balts, Capella was known as &quot;Perkūno Ožka&quot; &quot;Thunder&#x27;s Goat&quot;, or &quot;Tikutis&quot;. Conversely in Slavic Macedonian folklore, Capella was &quot;Jastreb&quot; &quot;the hawk&quot;, flying high above and ready to pounce on Mother Hen (the Pleiades) and the Rooster (Nath).

Astrologically, Capella portends civic and military honors and wealth. In the Middle Ages, it was considered a Behenian fixed star, with the stone sapphire and the plants horehound, mint, mugwort and mandrake as attributes. Cornelius Agrippa listed its kabbalistic sign with the name &quot;Hircus&quot; (Latin for &quot;goat&quot;).

In Hindu mythology, Capella was seen as the heart of Brahma, &quot;Brahma Hṛdaya&quot;. In traditional Chinese astronomy, Capella was part of the asterism (; English: &quot;Five Chariots&quot;), which consisted of Capella together with Beta Aurigae, Theta Aurigae and Iota Aurigae, as well as Beta Tauri. Since it was the second star in this asterism, it has the Chinese name (; English: &quot;Second of the Five Chariots&quot;).

In Quechua it was known as &quot;Colça&quot;; the Incas held the star in high regard. The Hawaiians saw Capella as part of an asterism &quot;Ke ka o Makali&#x27;i&quot; (&quot;The canoe bailer of Makali&#x27;i&quot;) that helped them navigate at sea. Called &quot;Hoku-lei&quot; &quot;star wreath&quot;, it formed this asterism with Procyon, Sirius, Castor and Pollux. In Tahitian folklore, Capella was &quot;Tahi-ari&#x27;i&quot;, the wife of &quot;Fa&#x27;a-nui&quot; (Auriga) and mother of prince &quot;Ta&#x27;urua&quot; (Venus) who sails his canoe across the sky. In Inuit astronomy, Capella, along with Menkalinan (Beta Aurigae), Pollux (Beta Geminorum) and Castor (Alpha Geminorum), formed a constellation Quturjuuk, &quot;collar-bones&quot;, the two pairs of stars denoting a bone each. Used for navigation and time-keeping at night, the constellation was recognised from Alaska to western Greenland. The Gwich&#x27;in saw Capella and Menkalinan has forming &quot;shreets&#x27;ą įį vidzee&quot;, the right ear of the large circumpolar constellation &quot;Yahdii&quot;, which covered much of the night sky, and whose orientation facilitated navigation and timekeeping.

In Australian Aboriginal mythology for the Boorong people of Victoria, Capella was &quot;Purra&quot;, the kangaroo, pursued and killed by the nearby Gemini twins, &quot;Yurree&quot; (Castor) and &quot;Wanjel&quot; (Pollux). The Wardaman people of northern Australia knew the star as &quot;Yagalal&quot;, a ceremonial fish scale, related to Guwamba the barramundi (Aldebaran).

<text>The Hot Gates is the title of a collection of essays by William Golding, author of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. The collection is divided into four sections: &quot;People and Places&quot;, &quot;Books&quot;, &quot;Westward Look&quot; and &quot;Caught in a Bush&quot;. Published in 1965, it includes pieces that Golding had written over the previous ten years. &quot;Caught in a Bush&quot; contains his childhood recollections &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; and &quot;The Ladder and the Tree&quot;, and his essay &quot;Fable&quot;, which answered questions about &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; appears in &quot;Books&quot;. &quot;Fable&quot; is based on lectures Golding gave at UCLA in California and he hoped it would answer &quot;some of the standard questions which students were asking&quot;. The book starts out with an essay on the Battle of Thermopylae, which can be translated from ancient Greek to English as &quot;hot gates&quot;, thus giving it the title. The Hot Gates are famous for being the place where Leonidas I made his last stand against the Persian army under Xerxes I.

<text>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the stem cells that give rise to other blood cells. This process is called haematopoiesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birbrair n/a–n/a&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In vertebrates, the first definitive HSCs arise from the ventral endothelial wall of the embryonic aorta within the (midgestational) aorta-gonad-mesonephros region, through a process known as endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. In adults, haematopoiesis occurs in the red bone marrow, in the core of most bones. The red bone marrow is derived from the layer of the embryo called the mesoderm.

Haematopoiesis is the process by which all mature blood cells are produced. It must balance enormous production needs (the average person produces more than 500 billion blood cells every day) with the need to regulate the number of each blood cell type in the circulation. In vertebrates, the vast majority of hematopoiesis occurs in the bone marrow and is derived from a limited number of hematopoietic stem cells that are multipotent and capable of extensive self-renewal.

Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to different types of blood cells, in lines called myeloid and lymphoid. Myeloid and lymphoid lineages both are involved in dendritic cell formation. Myeloid cells include monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes, and megakaryocytes to platelets. Lymphoid cells include T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and innate lymphoid cells.

The definition of hematopoietic stem cell has developed since they were first discovered in 1961. The hematopoietic tissue contains cells with long-term and short-term regeneration capacities and committed multipotent, oligopotent, and unipotent progenitors. Hematopoietic stem cells constitute 1:10,000 of cells in myeloid tissue.

HSC transplants are used in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders due to their regenerative properties.

== Structure ==
They are round, non-adherent, with a rounded nucleus and low cytoplasm-to-nucleus ratio. In shape, hematopoietic stem cells resemble lymphocytes.

===Location===
The very first hematopoietic stem cells during (mouse and human) embryonic development are found in aorta-gonad-mesonephros region and the vitelline and umbilical arteries. Slightly later, HSCs are also found in the placenta, yolk sac, embryonic head, and fetal liver.

Stem and progenitor cells can be taken from the pelvis, at the iliac crest, using a needle and syringe. The cells can be removed as liquid (to perform a smear to look at the cell morphology) or they can be removed via a core biopsy (to maintain the architecture or relationship of the cells to each other and to the bone).

===Subtypes===
A colony-forming unit is a subtype of HSC. (This sense of the term is different from colony-forming units of microbes, which is a cell counting unit.) There are various kinds of HSC colony-forming units:
* Colony-forming unit–granulocyte-erythrocyte-monocyte-megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM)
* Colony-forming unit–lymphocyte (CFU-L)
* Colony-forming unit–erythrocyte (CFU-E)
* Colony-forming unit–granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM)
* Colony-forming unit–megakaryocyte (CFU-Meg)
* Colony-forming unit–basophil (CFU-Baso)
* Colony-forming unit–eosinophil (CFU-Eos)

The above CFUs are based on the lineage. Another CFU, the colony-forming unit–spleen (CFU-S), was the basis of an &quot;in vivo&quot; clonal colony formation, which depends on the ability of infused bone marrow cells to give rise to clones of maturing hematopoietic cells in the spleens of irradiated mice after 8 to 12 days. It was used extensively in early studies, but is now considered to measure more mature progenitor or transit-amplifying cells rather than stem cells.

===Isolating stem cells===

Since hematopoietic stem cells cannot be isolated as a pure population, it is not possible to identify them in a microscope. Hematopoietic stem cells can be identified or isolated by the use of flow cytometry where the combination of several different cell surface markers (particularly CD34) are used to separate the rare hematopoietic stem cells from the surrounding blood cells. Hematopoietic stem cells lack expression of mature blood cell markers and are thus called Lin-. Lack of expression of lineage markers is used in combination with detection of several positive cell-surface markers to isolate hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, hematopoietic stem cells are characterised by their small size and low staining with vital dyes such as rhodamine 123 (rhodamine lo) or Hoechst 33342 (side population).

== Function ==
=== Haematopoiesis ===
Hematopoietic stem cells are essential to haematopoiesis, the formation of the cells within blood. Hematopoietic stem cells can replenish all blood cell types (i.e., are multipotent) and self-renew. A small number of hematopoietic stem cells can expand to generate a very large number of daughter hematopoietic stem cells. This phenomenon is used in bone marrow transplantation, when a small number of hematopoietic stem cells reconstitute the hematopoietic system. This process indicates that, subsequent to bone marrow transplantation, symmetrical cell divisions into two daughter hematopoietic stem cells must occur.

Stem cell self-renewal is thought to occur in the stem cell niche in the bone marrow, and it is reasonable to assume that key signals present in this niche will be important in self-renewal. There is much interest in the environmental and molecular requirements for HSC self-renewal, as understanding the ability of HSC to replenish themselves will eventually allow the generation of expanded populations of HSC &quot;in vitro&quot; that can be used therapeutically.

=== Quiescence ===
Hematopoietic stem cells, like all adult stem cells, mostly exist in a state of quiescence, or reversible growth arrest. The altered metabolism of quiescent HSCs helps the cells survive for extended periods of time in the hypoxic bone marrow environment. When provoked by cell death or damage, Hematopoietic stem cells exit quiescence and begin actively dividing again. The transition from dormancy to propagation and back is regulated by the MEK/ERK pathway and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Dysregulation of these transitions can lead to stem cell exhaustion, or the gradual loss of active Hematopoietic stem cells in the blood system.

===Mobility===
Hematopoietic stem cells have a higher potential than other immature blood cells to pass the bone marrow barrier, and, thus, may travel in the blood from the bone marrow in one bone to another bone. If they settle in the thymus, they may develop into T cells. In the case of fetuses and other extramedullary hematopoiesis. Hematopoietic stem cells may also settle in the liver or spleen and develop.

This enables Hematopoietic stem cells to be harvested directly from the blood.

==Clinical significance==
===Transplant===

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the transplantation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood. It may be autologous (the patient&#x27;s own stem cells are used), allogeneic (the stem cells come from a donor) or syngeneic (from an identical twin).

It is most often performed for patients with certain cancers of the blood or bone marrow, such as multiple myeloma or leukemia. In these cases, the recipient&#x27;s immune system is usually destroyed with radiation or chemotherapy before the transplantation. Infection and graft-versus-host disease are major complications of allogeneic HSCT.

In order to harvest stem cells from the circulating peripheral blood, blood donors are injected with a cytokine, such as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), that induces cells to leave the bone marrow and circulate in the blood vessels.
In mammalian embryology, the first definitive Hematopoietic stem cells are detected in the AGM (aorta-gonad-mesonephros), and then massively expanded in the fetal liver prior to colonising the bone marrow before birth.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains a dangerous procedure with many possible complications; it is reserved for patients with life-threatening diseases. As survival following the procedure has increased, its use has expanded beyond cancer to autoimmune diseases and hereditary skeletal dysplasias; notably malignant infantile osteopetrosis and mucopolysaccharidosis.

Stem cells can be used to regenerate different types of tissues. HCT is an established as therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphatic leukemia, aplastic anemia, and hemoglobinopathies, in addition to acute myeloid leukemia and primary immune deficiencies. Hematopoietic system regeneration is typically achieved within 2–4 weeks post-chemo- or irradiation therapy and HCT. HSCs are being clinically tested for their use in non-hematopoietic tissue regeneration.

=== Aging of hematopoietic stem cells ===
====DNA damage====
DNA strand breaks accumulate in long term hematopoietic stem cells during aging. This accumulation is associated with a broad attenuation of DNA repair and response pathways that depends on HSC quiescence. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs double-strand breaks in DNA. NHEJ is referred to as &quot;non-homologous&quot; because the break ends are directly ligated without the need for a homologous template. The NHEJ pathway depends on several proteins including ligase 4, DNA polymerase mu and NHEJ factor 1 (NHEJ1, also known as Cernunnos or XLF).

DNA ligase 4 (Lig4) has a highly specific role in the repair of double-strand breaks by NHEJ. Lig4 deficiency in the mouse causes a progressive loss of hematopoietic stem cells during aging. Deficiency of lig4 in pluripotent stem cells results in accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks and enhanced apoptosis.

In polymerase mu mutant mice, hematopoietic cell development is defective in several peripheral and bone marrow cell populations with about a 40% decrease in bone marrow cell number that includes several hematopoietic lineages. Expansion potential of hematopoietic progenitor cells is also reduced. These characteristics correlate with reduced ability to repair double-strand breaks in hematopoietic tissue.

Deficiency of NHEJ factor 1 in mice leads to premature aging of hematopoietic stem cells as indicated by several lines of evidence including evidence that long-term repopulation is defective and worsens over time. Using a human induced pluripotent stem cell model of NHEJ1 deficiency, it was shown that NHEJ1 has an important role in promoting survival of the primitive hematopoietic progenitors. These NHEJ1 deficient cells possess a weak NHEJ1-mediated repair capacity that is apparently incapable of coping with DNA damages induced by physiological stress, normal metabolism, and ionizing radiation.

The sensitivity of hematopoietic stem cells to Lig4, DNA polymerase mu and NHEJ1 deficiency suggests that NHEJ is a key determinant of the ability of stem cells to maintain themselves against physiological stress over time. Rossi et al. found that endogenous DNA damage accumulates with age even in wild type Hematopoietic stem cells, and suggested that DNA damage accrual may be an important physiological mechanism of stem cell aging.

====Loss of clonal diversity====
A study shows the clonal diversity of hematopoietic stem cells gets drastically reduced around age 70 , substantiating a novel theory of ageing which could enable healthy aging. Of note, the shift in clonal diversity during aging was previously reported in 2008 for the murine system by the Christa Muller-Sieburg laboratory in San Diego, California.

==Research==

===Behavior in culture===
A &quot;cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC)&quot; assay is a cell culture-based empirical assay. When plated onto a confluent culture of stromal feeder layer, a fraction of hematopoietic stem cells creep between the gaps (even though the stromal cells are touching each other) and eventually settle between the stromal cells and the substratum (here the dish surface) or trapped in the cellular processes between the stromal cells. Emperipolesis is the &quot;in vivo&quot; phenomenon in which one cell is completely engulfed into another (e.g. thymocytes into thymic nurse cells); on the other hand, when &quot;in vitro&quot;, lymphoid lineage cells creep beneath nurse-like cells, the process is called pseudoemperipolesis. This similar phenomenon is more commonly known in the HSC field by the cell culture terminology &quot;cobble stone area-forming cells (CAFC)&quot;, which means areas or clusters of cells look dull cobblestone-like under phase contrast microscopy, compared to the other hematopoietic stem cells, which are refractile. This happens because the cells that are floating loosely on top of the stromal cells are spherical and thus refractile. However, the cells that creep beneath the stromal cells are flattened and, thus, not refractile. The mechanism of pseudoemperipolesis is only recently coming to light. It may be mediated by interaction through CXCR4 (CD184) the receptor for CXC Chemokines (e.g., SDF1) and α4β1 integrins.

=== Repopulation kinetics ===
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) cannot be easily observed directly, and, therefore, their behaviors need to be inferred indirectly. Clonal studies are likely the closest technique for single cell in vivo studies of HSC. Here, sophisticated experimental and statistical methods are used to ascertain that, with a high probability, a single HSC is contained in a transplant administered to a lethally irradiated host. The clonal expansion of this stem cell can then be observed over time by monitoring the percent donor-type cells in blood as the host is reconstituted. The resulting time series is defined as the repopulation kinetic of the HSC.

The reconstitution kinetics are very heterogeneous. However, using symbolic dynamics, one can show that they fall into a limited number of classes. To prove this, several hundred experimental repopulation kinetics from clonal Thy-1lo SCA-1+ lin−(B220, CD4, CD8, Gr-1, Mac-1 and Ter-119) c-kit+ HSC were translated into symbolic sequences by assigning the symbols &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;~&quot; whenever two successive measurements of the percent donor-type cells have a positive, negative, or unchanged slope, respectively. By using the Hamming distance, the repopulation patterns were subjected to cluster analysis yielding 16 distinct groups of kinetics. To finish the empirical proof, the Laplace add-one approach was used to determine that the probability of finding kinetics not contained in these 16 groups is very small. By corollary, this result shows that the hematopoietic stem cell compartment is also heterogeneous by dynamical criteria.

It was originally believed that all hematopoietic stem cells were alike in their self-renewal and differentiation abilities. This view was first challenged by the 2002 discovery by the Muller-Sieburg group in San Diego, who illustrated that different stem cells can show distinct repopulation patterns that are epigenetically predetermined intrinsic properties of clonal Thy-1lo Sca-1+ lin− c-kit+ HSC. The results of these clonal studies led to the notion of lineage bias. Using the ratio formula_1 of lymphoid (L) to myeloid (M) cells in blood as a quantitative marker, the stem cell compartment can be split into three categories of HSC. Balanced (Bala) hematopoietic stem cells repopulate peripheral white blood cells in the same ratio of myeloid to lymphoid cells as seen in unmanipulated mice (on average about 15% myeloid and 85% lymphoid cells, or 3 ≤ ρ ≤ 10). Myeloid-biased (My-bi) hematopoietic stem cells give rise to very few lymphocytes resulting in ratios 0 &lt; ρ &lt; 3, while lymphoid-biased (Ly-bi) hematopoietic stem cells generate very few myeloid cells, which results in lymphoid-to-myeloid ratios of ρ &gt; 10. All three types are normal types of HSC, and they do not represent stages of differentiation. Rather, these are three classes of HSC, each with an epigenetically fixed differentiation program. These studies also showed that lineage bias is not stochastically regulated or dependent on differences in environmental influence. My-bi HSC self-renew longer than balanced or Ly-bi HSC. The myeloid bias results from reduced responsiveness to the lymphopoetin interleukin 7 (IL-7).

Subsequently, other groups confirmed and highlighted the original findings. For example, the Eaves group confirmed in 2007 that repopulation kinetics, long-term self-renewal capacity, and My-bi and Ly-bi are stably inherited intrinsic HSC properties. In 2010, the Goodell group provided additional insights about the molecular basis of lineage bias in side population (SP) SCA-1+ lin− c-kit+ HSC. As previously shown for IL-7 signaling, it was found that a member of the transforming growth factor family (TGF-beta) induces and inhibits the proliferation of My-bi and Ly-bi HSC, respectively.

==Etymology==
From Greek &quot;haimato-&quot;, combining form of &quot;haima&quot; &#x27;blood&#x27;, and from the Latinized form of Greek &quot;poietikos&quot; &#x27;capable of making, creative, productive&#x27;, from &quot;poiein&quot; &#x27;to make, create&#x27;.

<doc id="1264090" wikidata="Q1152840" url="?curid=1264090" title="João Cabral de Melo Neto">
<text>João Cabral de Melo Neto (January 6, 1920 – October 9, 1999) was a Brazilian poet and diplomat, and one of the most influential writers in late Brazilian modernism. He was awarded the 1990 Camões Prize and the 1992 Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the only Brazilian poet to receive such award to date. He was considered until his death a perennial competitor for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Melo Neto&#x27;s works are noted for the rigorous, yet inventive attention they pay to the formal aspects of poetry. He derives his characteristic sound from a traditional verse of five or seven syllables (called ‘’redondilha’’) and from the constant use of oblique rhymes. His style ranges from the surrealist tendency which marked his early poetry to the use of regional elements of his native northeastern Brazil. In many works, including the famed auto &quot;Morte e Vida Severina&quot;, Melo Neto&#x27;s addresses the life of those affected by the poverty and inequality in Pernambuco.

== Life and career ==
Melo Neto was born in Recife, Pernambuco, and spent most of his youth in his family&#x27;s sugar-cane mills in the interior of the state. He was a cousin of distinguished poet Manuel Bandeira and sociologist Gilberto Freyre. In 1940, his family moved to Rio de Janeiro.

Two years later, Melo Neto published his first book of poems, &quot;Pedra do Sono&quot;, at his own expense, with a circulation of 340 copies. In 1945, he applied to the post of diplomat, a position he would hold for most of his life. The following year, he married Stella Maria Barbosa de Oliveira, with whom he had five children.

After passing through several different countries, he became consul of Brazil in Porto in 1984, only returning to Rio de Janeiro three years later. He worked for many years in Spain, and his experiences in Seville would leave palpable influences in his poetry.

In 1956, Melo Neto published his most famous work, &quot;Morte e Vida Severina&quot;, and, in 1968, he was elected to the 37th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.

In 1986, he married Marly de Oliveira and, two years later, he retired, resigning from his office as ambassador. Melo Neto died in 1999, in Rio de Janeiro. In a career spanning more than fifty years, Melo Neto published 18 books of poetry and two plays.

==Poetry==
The image of an engineer designing a building, an epithet Melo Neto himself adopted, is often used to describe his poetry. From the start, his poetry was extraordinarily rich in imagery. Commenting &quot;Pedra do Sono&quot;, his first book, Antonio Candido, who noted his debt to cubism and surrealism, observed how his poems were composed from the accumulation of concrete and sensory images, using words in an almost pictorial manner.

Quickly, however, he proved highly attentive to the social reality of his state. In &quot;O cão sem plumas&quot; (“A Dog without Feathers”)’, his first long poem, dated from 1950, he portrayed the lives of the destitute classes, who depended on the Capibaribe River, and described the toiling of the sugar-cane mill. Three years later, in &quot;O Rio&quot; (“The River”) he assumed the voice of the river, narrating in first-person its course and the villages and landscapes it crossed.

Clarifying his debts to Melo Neto, Augusto de Campos has said: “One might say that he has no antecedents in Brazilian poetry, but his work has consequences. It is Concrete poetry that will sustain, continue, expand and broaden this poetic language that is not sentimental, but objective, a poetry of concretude, a critical poetry, as João&#x27;s poetry is.”

<doc id="1264097" wikidata="Q1631829" url="?curid=1264097" title="Theodorus of Gadara">
<text>Theodorus of Gadara () was a Greek rhetorician of the 1st century BC from Gadara (present-day Um Qais, Jordan) who founded a rhetorical school in his native city. According to the &quot;Suda,&quot; he taught future Roman emperor Tiberius the art of rhetoric. Suetonius (c. 69 – after 122 AD) wrote of Tiberius that:

Theodorus was one of the two most famous rhetoric teachers of his time, the other being Apollodorus of Pergamon. Students of Apollodorus were commonly referred to as &quot;Apollodoreans&quot;, while students of Theodorus were known as &quot;Theodoreans&quot;.

He participated in sophistic contests with Potamo of Mytilene and Antipater in Rome. The Suda claims that he had a son, Antonius, who became a senator under Emperor Hadrian.

==Works==
According to the Suda, Theodorus wrote the following books, among others: 
*&quot;On Questions in Pronunciation&quot; (Περὶ τῶν ἐν φωναῖς ζητουμένων, in 3 books)
*&quot;On History&quot; (Περὶ ἱστορίας, 1 book)
*&quot;On Thesis&quot; (Περὶ θέσεως, 1 book)
*&quot;On the Similarity of Dialects and its Demonstration&quot; (Περὶ διαλέκτων ὁμοιότητος καὶ ἀποδείξεως, 2 books)
*&quot;On the Constitution&quot; (Περὶ πολιτείας, 2 books)
*&quot;On Coele Syria&quot; (Περὶ Κοίλης Συρίας, 1 book)
*&quot;On the Capacity of the Orator&quot; (Περὶ ῥήτορος δυνάμεως, 1 book)

<doc id="1264106" wikidata="Q4929809" url="?curid=1264106" title="Blue Room (Unwritten Law album)">
<text>Blue Room is the debut album by American punk rock band Unwritten Law. It was released in 1994 by Red Eye Records. It was the band&#x27;s first full-length album and established their presence in the prolific San Diego music scene of the early 1990s. The album attracted the attention of Epic Records, who re-released it a year after its original release.

The album&#x27;s title is a reference to the single-room apartment that singer Scott Russo lived in during the band&#x27;s early years and where most of the album was written (the room was painted entirely blue). The song title &quot;C.P.K.&quot; stands for &quot;Crazy Poway Kids&quot; and is a reference to the band&#x27;s hometown of Poway, California (a suburb of San Diego). &quot;Blurred (Part 2)&quot; is a reference to a song on the band&#x27;s debut EP &quot;Blurr&quot;. The songs &quot;Shallow&quot; and &quot;Suzanne&quot; would be re-recorded for their second album &quot;Oz Factor&quot;.

<text>The IIHF Women&#x27;s World Championship is the premier international women&#x27;s tournament in ice hockey. It is governed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).

The official world competition was first held in 1990, with four more championships held in the 90s. From 1989 to 1996, and in years that there was no world tournament held, there were European Championships and in 1995 and 1996 a Pacific Rim Championship. From the first Olympic Women&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament in 1998 onward, the Olympic tournament was played instead of the IIHF Championships. Afterwards, the IIHF decided to hold Women&#x27;s Championships in Olympic years, starting in 2014, but not at the top level. In September 2021, it was announced that the top division will also play during Olympic years and in August–September.

Canada and the United States have dominated the Championship since its inception. Canada won gold at the first eight consecutive tournaments and the United States has won gold at ten of the last fifteen tournaments. Both national teams placed either first or second every tournament until Canada&#x27;s streak was broken at the 2019 Championship. Finland is the third most successful World Championship team, having won fourteen bronze medals and one silver medal – achieved after breaking the Canadian gold-silver streak. Four other teams have medalled at a Women&#x27;s World Championship: Russia, winning three bronze medals; Czech Republic and Sweden, each winning two; and Switzerland, winning one.

==Structure and qualification==
The women&#x27;s tournament began as an eight-team tournament featuring Canada, the US, the top five from the 1989 European Championships, and one Asian qualifier. The same formula was used for 1992, 1994, and 1997, but changed following the first Olympic women&#x27;s ice hockey tournament at the 1998 Nagano Olympics. The top five teams from the Olympic tournament qualified for the 1999 World Championship, followed by the best three from final Olympic qualification rounds. Beginning in 1999, the championship became an annual tournament and the first divisional tournaments below the Top Division were played. Along with the creation of the lower divisions, a system of promotion and relegation was introduced, allowing for movement between all divisions.

After the 2017 tournament, it was announced that tournament would expand to 10 teams for 2019, having been played with 8 teams since the first tournament in 1990, except in 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2009, where 9 teams played. The 2004 edition featured 9 teams when Japan was promoted from Division II but no team was relegated from the Top Division in 2003, due to the cancellation of the top division tournament in China because of the outbreak of the SARS disease. Two teams were relegated from the Top Division in 2004, going back to 8 teams for 2005, but due to the success of the 9-team pool in 2004, IIHF decided to expand again to 9 teams for 2007. IIHF reverted to 8 teams after the 2009 tournament, and play continued in this format until the expansion of 2019.

===Championship format===
Initially, the tournament was an eight-team tournament divided into two groups, which played round-robin. The top two from each group played off for the gold, and beginning in 1999 the bottom two played off to determine placement and relegation. In 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2009 the tournament was played with nine nations, using three groups of three playing round-robin. In this format first place from each group continued on to play for gold, second place from each group played for placement and an opportunity to still play for bronze, and the third place teams played off to determine relegation. Beginning in 2011, the tournament changed the format to encourage more equal games. The top four seed nations played in Group A, where the top two teams got a bye to the semifinals, the bottom two go to the quarter-finals to face the top two finishers from Group B. The bottom two from Group B then play each other in a best of three to determine relegation. Beginning in 2019 the tournament was expanded to ten teams, bringing with it a new format. The ten teams are divided into two groups of five and play round-robin. In this format, the five teams in Group A and the top three teams from Group B move into the Quarterfinals, seeded A1vsB3, A2vsB2, A3vsB1, and A4vsA5. The bottom two from Group B now play only one 9th place game and both get relegated. As of 2021, the four teams that lose their quarterfinal games enter into a knockout tournament to determine 5th place with the winner earning a spot in Group A for the next tournament, though the 2024 tournament will not include these games. From 2025 on, the ten teams will be put into two groups of five, with the top four teams advancing to the knockout stage while the last-placed teams will play out the relegated team.

===Lower divisions===
Outside of the Top Division tournament, participating nations play in groups of no more than six teams. , there are six group tiers across three divisions below the Top Division.

Introduced in 1999 as a Division I tournament and Division I qualification tournament, the number of lower divisions rapidly expanded as more national teams gained admittance. By 2003 the lower tiers were formalized into tiered groups of six teams each, called Division I, Division II, and Division III, with promotion for the top team in each and relegation for the bottom team. By 2009 it had grown up to Division V, but in 2012 the titles were changed to match the men&#x27;s tournaments; Division I became IA, Division II became IB, Division III became IIA, Division IV became IIB, and Division V became IIB Qualification. Promotion and relegation remained the same after the title changes.

==Rules and eligibility==

The rules of play are essentially the same as used for the men&#x27;s tournaments, with one key difference: body checking is not permitted in the women&#x27;s tournaments. Body checking was allowed at the first championship in 1990 but has been assessed as a minor penalty at all subsequent tournaments.

In order to be eligible to compete in IIHF events, players must be under the jurisdiction of the governing body they are representing and must be a citizen of that country. Additionally, the player must be eighteen years old, or sixteen with a medical waiver, in the season the tournament takes place.

==Awards==
At most IIHF events, the tournament directorate awards the Best Forward, Best Defenceman, Best Goalkeeper and Most Valuable Player (MVP). At the Women&#x27;s World Championship, these honours have been awarded in some combination since the first tournament, with the exception of 1997 and the cancelled tournaments in 2003 and 2020.

<doc id="1264116" wikidata="Q4667224" url="?curid=1264116" title="Aberystwyth Cliff Railway">
<text>The Aberystwyth Cliff Railway () opened on 1 August 1896. It is a long funicular railway in Aberystwyth and is the second longest funicular railway in the British Isles, after the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway. Since November 1987, the Aberystwyth Cliff Railway has been a Grade II listed structure.

The Cliff Railway was developed as an element of Constitution Hill, a Victorian business venture by the Aberystwyth Improvement Company in the 1890s. The funicular took visitors to the top of the hill, where attractions such as a camera obscura were established. The cliff railway was originally a water balance system, but it was electrified during 1921. Passengers numbers were high during its initial decades, but dropped after the outbreak of the Second World War and stayed depressed for decades. The cliff railway is now owned and run by Constitution Hill Ltd, a registered charity. It is open to passengers during the summer months, typically operating between April and October, with a reduced timetable during the rest of the year.

==Location==
The Aberystwyth Cliff Railway was part of the Constitution Hill development built by the Aberystwyth Improvement Company, established in 1895. It was an early theme park, consisting of arcades and restaurant at the foot of the hill, and a camera obscura and park at the top. The funicular railway was developed to transport people between the areas. Constitution Hill was designed and engineered by George Croydon Marks who also designed the pavilion for the Aberystwyth Royal Pier, and a meandering footpath as an alternative to the Cliff Railway. Around 12,000 tonnes of rock was excavated for the middle section of the footpath to accommodate a footbridge over the cliff railway. The area is surrounded by the gardens and pleasure grounds of Constitution Hill.

==Design==

The cliff railway was originally a cable-drawn balanced system moving a pair of cars, with a maximum capacity of 30 passengers, permanently connected via a continuous cable. When opened, it operated using a water balance system, which used a Worthington Corporation compound steam engine water pump housed in the lower station to move water to the upper station. Each passenger car had a tank in their chassis that could hold 4 tonnes of water. Water was added to the tank of the top car, which descended under gravity, hauling the lighter lower car on the parallel track to the top station.

The railway is straight, ascending about over a horizontal distance of , a maximum gradient of more than 1:2 (50 per cent). The gauge is , slightly narrower than standard gauge, and laid on timber sleepers.

In 1921, the railway was electrified using a 41 kW Morley DC motor. In 1934, after changes to the town’s electricity supply, a mercury arc rectifier and transformer were installed in the lower station to provide a 440V DC power output. The cars are moved using a high-tensile steel cable attached to both vehicles. It passes around a drum, mounted on a vertical axis between the tracks at the top. The motor drives the drum controlled by an automated cut-off which stops the motor and the cars when required.

Its twin carriages are named &quot;Lord Geraint&quot; and &quot;Lord Marks.&quot;

==Operations==
The cliff railway opened to the public in 1896; and was credited with stimulating the development of Constitution Hill as a popular leisure area.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the cliff railway was popular with visitors but during and after the Second World War, passenger numbers declined significantly. In 1948, seeking to revive its fortunes, the Aberystwyth Pier Company bought it and carried out repairs and upgrades. The new owners were unable to increase passenger numbers.

In 1976, the railway was closed briefly on account of a fault in its braking system. During the late 1970s, a local mining company acquired a majority stake and formed the Aberystwyth Cliff Railway Company to operate it. In 1978 a new electrical system was installed which is used to the present day. It takes its power from and returns surplus energy to the National Grid.

In November 1987, the cliff railway was recognised as a Grade II listed structure. In 1998, it was purchased by Constitution Hill Ltd, a registered charity, the trustees are volunteers; all profits generated support the railway&#x27;s maintenance and restoration activities. The cliff railway has received some external funding, including grants from European Union funds.

The railway is operated under a light railway order. The line is open to passengers during the summer months, typically operating between April and October, while transitioning to a limited timetable during the colder months.

The upper station was refurbished with a café and gift shop during 2005 and roof repairs were made in 2014. Ramps and other adaptations make the service accessible to wheelchair users. The ticket office at the lower station has been converted into a holiday apartment. Of the four original timber bridges constructed to carry hillside paths over the railway, three remain at the northern half of the route for foot traffic.

<text>Here&#x27;s to the Mourning is the fifth studio album by American rock band Unwritten Law, released in 2005 by Lava Records. Much of the lyrics on the album were co-written by singer/songwriter Aimee Allen. She and singer Scott Russo soon began a romantic relationship and formed the side project Scott &amp; Aimee. Allen and Linda Perry contributed to the writing of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Save Me (Wake Up Call),&quot; which reached #5 on US modern rock charts. Overall the album reached #51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the highest-ranking album of the band&#x27;s career. Songs featured in racing games include “Celebration Song”, which is featured on &quot;MX vs. ATV Unleashed&quot; and &quot;Need for Speed: Underground 2&quot;. and &quot;F.I.G.H.T&quot; which is featured on &quot;Burnout Revenge&quot; and &quot;Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition&quot;.

==Production==
The band spent about eight months recording the album. When they began to record the album they were without a drummer (founding drummer Wade Youman had been expelled from the band). They were joined in the studio by Adrian Young of No Doubt and Tony Palermo of Pulley who filled in on drums for the recording, as singer Scott Russo stated in a 2005 interview: &quot;They can both play drums really well, on top of their drumming skills, they brought really good energy to the record&quot;.

The band got along so well with Palermo that by the time of the album&#x27;s release he had joined as their permanent drummer. 

In a February 2005 interview on Super Request, Russo mentioned that the band started recording the album with producer Josh Abraham, but they felt that the songs were sounding dated, like their previous works, Abraham was fired after a few songs, according to Russo, they wanted the album to sound like a modern day version of Closer, the band tried to get Trent Reznor to produce, but he wasn’t available, so they ended up getting Sean Beavan, who had worked with Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson, and No Doubt.

The album was also the band&#x27;s last one with rhythm guitarist Rob Brewer, who was ejected from the group in March 2005.

In a 2011 interview, former guitarist Steve Morris had recalled working on the album:&quot;Here&#x27;s To The Mourning was written when the band had a lot of interpersonal turmoil going on. None of (us) were really friends let alone a functioning professional band. We fired our original drummer during the writing process do to his personal issues with drugs and other things. And we could barely get into the studio with each other&quot;.

<doc id="1264155" wikidata="Q132481" url="?curid=1264155" title="Anserimimus">
<text>Anserimimus ( ; &quot;goose mimic&quot;) is a genus of ornithomimid theropod dinosaur, from the Late Cretaceous Period of what is now Mongolia. It was a lanky, fast-running animal, possibly an omnivore. From what fossils are known, it probably closely resembled other ornithomimids, except for its more powerful forelimbs.

==Discovery==
&quot;Anserimimus&quot; was found in the Mongolian aimag, or province, of Bayankhongor during a joint Soviet-Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert, in the late 1970s. 
Mongolian paleontologist Rinchen Barsbold named &quot;Anserimimus&quot; in 1988, combining the Latin &quot;anser&quot; meaning &#x27;goose&#x27; with the Greek &quot;mimos&quot; meaning &#x27;mimic&#x27;. &quot;Anser&quot; is the generic name of several species of geese. Although &quot;Anserimimus&quot; does not specifically resemble a goose, ornithomimosaurs have traditionally been named after different types of birds, such as &quot;Struthiomimus&quot; (&#x27;ostrich mimic&#x27;), &quot;Gallimimus&quot; (&#x27;rooster mimic&#x27;), and &quot;Pelecanimimus&quot; (&#x27;pelican mimic&#x27;). The one named species of &quot;Anserimimus&quot; is called &quot;Anserimimus planinychus&quot;. The specific name is derived from the Latin &quot;planus&quot; meaning &#x27;flat&#x27;, and the Ancient Greek ὄνυξ, &quot;onyx&quot;, meaning &#x27;claw&#x27;, in reference to the peculiar flattened claws which characterize the genus.
There is only a single specimen of &quot;Anserimimus&quot;, its holotype IGM 100/300. It consists of a rather complete and articulated skeleton lacking the skull and lower jaws. Limited information has been published on the anatomy of &quot;Anserimimus&quot;, as Barsbold did not describe most of these bones, instead focusing on only those with features that set &quot;Anserimimus&quot; apart from other ornithomimids. In an unpublished thesis Robert Bronowicz in 2005 gave a detailed description of the species, also referring to additional material to it, among which a second partial skeleton, specimen ZPAL MgD-I/65. However, in 2010 Bronowicz concluded this other find, though most closely related to &quot;Anserimimus planinychus&quot;, probably represented a separate taxon.

==Description==
&quot;Anserimimus&quot; was a medium-sized ornithomimosaurian. Gregory S. Paul in 2010 estimated its length at , and its weight at . Other studies suggested that the holotype was heavier, weighing up to . The thighbone is 435 millimetres long.

There are several key differences between it and related species, though most of these are shared with ZPAL MgD-I/65. The claws on the hand are long, low at the back, and rather straight, only slightly curved, with the lower surface nearly flat. The forelimb is long and also built more powerfully than that of other ornithomimids, with large crests on the scapulocoracoid of the shoulder and humerus (upper arm bone), which provided attachment points for large arm muscles like the biceps. The metacarpus of the hand is fused, adding to the strength. The foot is strongly arctometatarsalian, with the third metatarsal excluded from the front surface of the metatarsus over 40% of its upper length.

==Phylogeny==

&quot;Anserimimus&quot; was by Barsbold assigned to the Ornithomimidae, a group of derived Ornithomimosauria. This has been confirmed by modern cladistic analysis. Its closest relative may be &quot;Gallimimus&quot; from the same formation albeit from a different area (Kobayashi &amp; Lu, 2003; Kobayashi &amp; Barsbold, 2005). Other studies have been unable specifically to determine its relationships or those of any other ornithomimids (Ji &quot;et al.&quot;, 2003; Makovicky &quot;et al.&quot;, 2004).

The following cladogram is based on Xu &quot;et al.&quot;, 2011:

==Paleobiology==
The function of the powerful arm, with its straightened claws, remains unknown. It may indicate a different diet of food-gathering strategy than other ornithomimids, although its diet is difficult to determine, since the animal&#x27;s skull is unknown. Scientists have long hypothesized that ornithomimids, descended from carnivorous theropod ancestors, were actually omnivores or even herbivores.

==Paleoecology==
&quot;Anserimimus&quot; was recovered from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia. The Nemegt is thought to represent alluvial plains containing meandering rivers. The layer &quot;Anserimimus&quot; was found, is dated from the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, or about 70 million years ago.

Aside from &quot;Gallimimus&quot;, other theropods found in the Nemegt Formation include the gigantic &quot;Tarbosaurus&quot; and &quot;Deinocheirus&quot;, as well as smaller dromaeosaurids, oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and birds. Herbivores are represented by the hadrosaurids &quot;Barsboldia&quot; and &quot;Saurolophus&quot;, the ankylosaurid &quot;Tarchia&quot; and several titanosaurian sauropods and pachycephalosaurians. The rock facies of this formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Sediments also indicate that there existed a rich habitat, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain massive Cretaceous dinosaurs.

<text>Tina R. Molinari (born October 25, 1956) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2003, serving as an associate minister and member of the Cabinet in the government of Ernie Eves. As of 2007, she works as a Justice of the Peace.

==School trustee==
Molinari served as president of a local Parent Teacher Association, and was elected to the York Catholic District School Board in 1988. She served as chair of the board from 1994 to 1998, and was also given a Catholic School Trustees Association Trustee Award of Merit in 1998.

==Provincial politics==
Molinari was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Liberal candidate Dan Ronen in the riding of Thornhill. Molinari&#x27;s bid for election was almost derailed early in the campaign when one of her pollsters asked constituents how they felt about being represented by a candidate who was the son of a Holocaust survivor (Ronen&#x27;s father had survived internment at Auschwitz, and Thornhill has a large Orthodox Jewish population). She overcame this controversy, however, and defeated Ronen by 343 votes.

Ernie Eves replaced Mike Harris as Premier of Ontario on April 15, 2002, and he appointed Molinari as an Associate Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing with responsibility for urban affairs.

There were some who believed that Molinari would be re-elected in the provincial election of 2003, because of her party&#x27;s support for a tax credit to parents who send their children to private or denominational schools. This issue was important to some members of Toronto&#x27;s Jewish community, and Dan Ronen even chose to endorse Molinari for re-election because of her party&#x27;s stand on this single issue.

While she polled better than most other Tories in the Greater Toronto Area, Molinari was not able to overcome a provincial shift to the Liberals and lost to local councillor Mario Racco by 796 votes.

==Later life==
In 2004, Molinari was appointed to a post in Catholic Missions in Canada. Some regarded this appointment as controversial, given Molinari&#x27;s pro-choice views on abortion. She has organized and hosted an annual fundraiser to raise funds for Catholic Missions within Canada.

Molinari campaigned for the Ward Four council seat in the 2006 Vaughan municipal election, and lost to Sandra Yeung Racco, the wife of the former Thornhill MPP who unseated Molinari in 2003.

On May 18, 2007, Ontario&#x27;s Attorney General Michael Bryant announced Molinari&#x27;s appointment as a justice of the peace.

<doc id="1264173" wikidata="Q6795349" url="?curid=1264173" title="Max Wall">
<text>Maxwell George Lorimer (12 March 1908 – 21 May 1990), known professionally as Max Wall, was an English actor and comedian whose performing career covered music hall, films, television and theatre.

==Early years==
Wall was born Maxwell George Lorimer, son of the successful music hall entertainer Jack (Jock) Lorimer, a Scottish comedy actor from Forfar, known for his songs and dancing, and his wife Stella (born Maud Clara Mitchison). He was born near the Oval, at 37 Glenshaw Mansions, Brixton Road, Lambeth, London SW9. In 1916, during a World War I air raid, Max and his elder brother Alex were saved from death by a cast-iron bed frame, but his younger brother Bunty and their Aunt Betty, who was looking after them, were killed by a bomb dropped from a German Zeppelin which also destroyed their house.

Max and Alex went to live with their father and his family, whilst their mother went to live with Harry Wallace, whom she had met on tour. When their father died of tuberculosis in 1920, aged 37, their mother married Harry Wallace, and they all moved to a pub in Essex.

==Career==

===Early career===
Wall auditioned for a part with a touring theatre company, and made his stage début at the age of 14 as Jack in &quot;Mother Goose&quot; with a travelling pantomime company in Devon and Cornwall featuring George Lacey. In 1925 he was a speciality dancer in the London Revue at the Lyceum. He became determined not to rely on his father&#x27;s name, so abbreviated Maxwell to Max, and his stepfather&#x27;s name Wallace, to Wall.

He is best remembered for his ludicrously attired and hilariously strutting &quot;Professor Wallofski&quot;. John Cleese has acknowledged Wall&#x27;s influence on his own &quot;Ministry of Silly Walks&quot; sketch for &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. After appearing in many musicals and stage comedies in the 1930s, Wall&#x27;s career went into decline, and he was reduced to working in obscure nightclubs. He then joined the Royal Air Force during World War II and served for three years until he was invalided out in 1943.

Wall married dancer Marion Pola and the couple had five children. In an interview with the family in the mid-1950s, &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;The kind of private jokes you find in all the nicest families flourish with the Walls. After Max and his wife, Marion, had their first son, Michael, it seemed kind of natural to make a corner in names beginning with &#x27;M&#x27;, and there are now Melvyn (aged nine), Martin (nearly five) and the four-month-old twins Meredith and Maxine. ... In the same way, because the Walls, like other couples married during the war, were eventually thrilled when they found a house with four walls of their own, they decided to call it just that, only Martin arrived and made it &#x27;Five Walls&#x27;.&quot;

In a rare outing to the musical stage he played Hines in the original London production of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, which opened at the London Coliseum in October 1955 and ran for 588 performances. In that year he began an affair with Jennifer Chimes, the 1955 Miss Great Britain. He divorced his wife and married Jennifer in 1956. The relationship attracted widespread press condemnation. In 1957 Wall experienced mental health issues that affected his work. Jennifer and Max divorced in 1962.

===Re-emergence===
In 1966, he appeared as Père Ubu in Jarry&#x27;s &quot;Ubu Roi&quot;, and in 1972 he toured with Mott the Hoople on their &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Circus Tour&quot;, gaining a new audience. Wall re-emerged during the 1970s when producers and directors rediscovered his comic talents, along with the expressive power of his tragic clown face and the distinctive sad falling cadences of his voice. He secured television appearances and, having attracted Samuel Beckett&#x27;s attention, he won parts in &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in 1979 and &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; in 1984. His straight acting gained him this review in 1974: &quot;Max Wall makes Olivier look like an amateur in &quot;The Entertainer&quot; at Greenwich Theatre...&quot;.

He also appeared in &quot;Crossroads&quot; (as Walter Soper, 1982 to 1983), &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (as Harry Payne, 1978) and what was then &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; (as Arthur Braithwaite, 1978). He played ex-con Ernie Dodds in &quot;Minder&quot; in 1982, with George Cole.

===Later work===
Wall played one of the inventors in the 1968 film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; and in 1977 he was seen as King Bruno the Questionable in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s film &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;. In the 1970s and 80s, Wall occasionally performed a one-man stage show, &quot;Aspects of Max Wall&quot;, in which he recaptured the humour of old-time music hall theatre.

On 1 April 1977, Wall&#x27;s version of Ian Dury&#x27;s song &quot;England&#x27;s Glory&quot; (which featured in Dury&#x27;s stage show &quot;Apples&quot;) was issued on Stiff Records (BUY 12), backed with &quot;Dream Tobacco&quot; and given away with the album &quot;Hits Greatest Stiffs&quot;. Wall also appeared onstage with Dury at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1978, but was poorly received, and said &quot;They only want the walk&quot;.

In 1981, Wall played &quot;Ernie&quot;, a central character in the &quot;&quot;Minder&quot;&quot; TV series episode &quot;The Birdman of Wormwood Scrubs&quot;.

Between 1982 and 1984 he appeared as Tombs in the BBC Two adaptation of &quot;Jane&quot; based on the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; comic-strip character and filmed with similar &quot;comic-strip frames&quot;. In the second series his place in the castlist was upgraded to second, after Glynis Barber.
He also appeared in Thames Television&#x27;s 1978 twelve-part series &quot;Born and Bred&quot; as retired music hall legend Tommy Tonsley, trying with various degrees of success, to keep his huge south London family in line.

His last film appearance was in 1989 in the 12-minute film &quot;A Fear of Silence&quot;, a dark tale of a man who drives a stranger to a confession of murder by answering only &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to his questions; those two words, repeated, were his only dialogue. The film won a gold award in the New York Film and TV Festival.

==Death==

On the afternoon of 20 May 1990 Wall fell at Simpson&#x27;s-in-the-Strand in central London, fracturing his skull. He was conveyed by ambulance to Westminster Hospital in an unconscious state, but never regained consciousness, and died there early in the next morning, at the age of 82. His body was buried at Highgate Cemetery.

Wall had four sons and a daughter.

==Legacy==
There is a Max Wall Society, which aims to perpetuate his memory. In 2006 the Society placed an unofficial blue plaque on Wall&#x27;s birthplace in South London.

<doc id="1264174" wikidata="Q7569250" url="?curid=1264174" title="Southcote, Berkshire">
<text>Southcote () is a suburb of Reading in the English county of Berkshire. Located to the south-west of Reading town centre, Southcote has a population of about 8,500 (as of 2011). The settlement lies primarily between the London-to-Bath road and the River Kennet.

The area was sparsely populated until after the Second World War, though excavations have revealed evidence of Paleolithic and Iron Age activity in Southcote, as well as Roman and Saxon habitation. By the time William the Conqueror undertook the Domesday Survey in 1086, Southcote was sufficiently established to warrant a Lord of the Manor, who at that time was William de Braose. From the 16th century onwards, Southcote Manor was owned by the Blagrave family, who sold the manor house in the 1920s. The area was subsequently developed into housing: much of the land changed from agricultural to residential. A large proportion of the land in Southcote not used for housing is classified as flood-meadow, providing flood plains between urbanisation and the River Kennet.

Southcote forms an electoral ward in Reading. The area is seen as a safe seat for Labour, as the Conservatives have not held a seat on the council since the 1980s.

Residents of Southcote generally self-classify as Christian. The male life expectancy in the area is lower than the national estimate, although the female expectancy is slightly higher. Claimants of out-of-work benefits (such as Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance) are more prevalent in Southcote than in surrounding areas. Attainment in education in Southcote is lower than the Reading average, as is residents&#x27; self-evaluation of health.

Near to the settlement is Southcote Junction, where the Great Western Main Line diverges into the Reading to Taunton line and the Reading to Basingstoke line. The railways were preceded by the Kennet and Avon Canal, which passes south of the settlement. Southcote lends its name to the 104th lock on the canal.

== History ==

=== Toponymy ===
Recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Sudcote&quot;, Southcote has also been referred to as &quot;Sutcot&quot;, &quot;Sudcot&quot;, &quot;Sukote&quot;, &quot;Suthcot&quot;, &quot;Suthcote&quot;, &quot;Suthcotes&quot;, and &quot;Southcoat&quot;, with the present spelling entering usage in the 15th century. Alternative spellings of &quot;Southcot&quot; and &quot;Southcott&quot; have also been used.

The name &quot;Southcote&quot;, comparable to that of neighbouring Norcot, originates from the Old English &quot;suth cote&quot;, meaning &quot;south[ern] cottage&quot;. It is likely that Circuit Lane, one of the primary roads into Southcote, derives its name from &quot;Circourt Lane&quot;, a corruption of &quot;Southcote Lane&quot;. A similar development of names occurred at Circourt Manor near Denchworth, Oxfordshire.

=== Early history ===
Lower Paleolithic and Palaeolithic materials have been recovered in various excavations in the Southcote area. An Iron Age occupation was located when houses were constructed in the 20th century.
A Saxon urn was found in Southcote in 1924. The urn contained ashes and bone fragments, and was given to the Museum of Reading. A polished stone celt was also found in Southcote in 1926.
An excavation of Southcote Manor in the 1960s uncovered many Roman, Romano-British and medieval artefacts such as sherds and pottery; a sample of the latter was discovered to have originated in Oxford in the 2nd century. Similarly, a Pannonian brooch and samian ware have been found in the area, and Roman pottery was found in the vicinity of the clay pits at Prospect Park Brick Works.
Later inhabitation of Southcote was discovered at Anslow&#x27;s Cottages south of the Kennet, where excavation suggests that a Bronze Age waterfront was made on a branch of the river. A 1991 report by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England—now known as English Heritage—detailed the discovery of fragments of twined basketry at Anslow&#x27;s Cottages, showing that eel or fish traps were used on the river near Southcote. Archaeological findings of timber structures adjacent to the trap suggest that it dated from the eight or ninth century. Later discoveries, made in the 1980s during gravel extraction in the area, also uncovered evidence of a landing stage or jetty on the river channel.

=== 11th–15th century ===
The settlement of Southcote grew largely around the medieval house at Southcote Manor. Before the Norman Conquest, Southcote was held by Brictward—a Saxon landowner and priest—under Edward the Confessor. The settlement was documented in the Domesday Book as &quot;Sudcote&quot; with a total population of 13 households, consisting of five villagers and eight smallholders, though a manor house is not mentioned. At this time Southcote was mostly ploughlands, but had a mill and a fishery, and was valued at £5. The Lord of the Manor at the time was William de Braose, 1st Lord of Bramber. In the early 1200s a house was built and Southcote was owned by Henry Belet. This house had two moats, supplied with water by a channel from the nearby Holy Brook. Upon Henry&#x27;s death the estate was inherited by his son Michael, who was cup-bearer to Henry II. In 1337, a grant of free warren was made to the Belet family for the manor.

In 1365 the manor and 13th-century moated house passed into the Restwold family, and it passed through marriage to the Drew family of Seagry, Wiltshire, then the Sambourne family. Margaret Sambourne, the heir to the manor, died in 1494 and an inquisition the following year suggested that she held the manor (then valued at £20) as a trustee on behalf of Hugh Kenepy. Around this time a brick house was built to replace the earlier dwelling. After the death of Sambourne&#x27;s son, Drew, an inquisition reported in contradiction that the manor was held by the Abbot of Reading; in their work on the Berkshire section of &quot;Victoria County History&quot;, Peter Ditchfield and William Henry Page write that at this point &quot;the correct tenure had evidently been lost&quot;. Through Drew Sambourne&#x27;s granddaughter, Margaret, the manor passed through marriage to William Windsor, 2nd Baron Windsor. William&#x27;s grandson, Henry (5th Baron Windsor), sold the manor to Anthony Blagrave by the early 16th century.

=== 16th–19th century ===
The Blagrave family were wealthy landowners around Reading, and the manor passed down through the family (which included mathematician John Blagrave, who built a new house at Southcote); a lease document dated from 1596 suggests that the manor was divided between three Blagrave brothers. Daniel Blagrave, a cousin of John, inherited the manor on the latter&#x27;s death in 1611. At the time of the English Civil War, during the siege of Reading in 1643, the Blagraves allowed Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex to use the manor as his headquarters. The Blagrave family, who were sympathetic to the Roundheads, are said to have hosted Oliver Cromwell, John Hampden and Robert Blake for a council of war in one of the house&#x27;s oak panelled rooms. In January 1649, Daniel was one of the signatories of Charles I&#x27;s death warrant.

In 1665 Elias Ashmole wrote to Mervyn Tuchet, 4th Earl of Castlehaven at &quot;Southcote neere Redding&quot;. At some point that century the manor house was largely rebuilt and modernised; the existing 15th century guardhouse and vaulted well were retained.
Come the Restoration in 1660 after the end of the war, Daniel fled from England and died in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1668.
Southcote saw development with the opening of the Kennet Navigation in the 1720s, where the River Kennet was made navigable by vessels as far upstream as Newbury; industrialisation along the canal continued for the next century.

Throughout the 18th century the manor continued to pass through the Blagrave family, including John Blagrave MP. In 1778, Frances Blagrave married John Blagrave of Watchfield (Ditchfield and Page suggest that the couple were not related before marriage). In 1813, Daniel and Samuel Lysons wrote that the manor and mansion house were unoccupied but remained the property of the Blagrave family, who at that point resided at nearby Calcot Park. The same year, Calvespit House (near Calvespit Farm to the west of Southcote Manor) was renamed Southcott Lodge and incorporated into the estate. Between 1828 and 1850 the house was let to Charles and Frances Lutyens, whose son Charles was born at the house and who later fathered the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.

Southcote was mentioned in Samuel Lewis&#x27;s 1835 &quot;Topographical Dictionary of England&quot;. It was described as a tything within the parish of St Mary&#x27;s, Reading, and had a population of 84.

In 1847, the Reading to Taunton branch of the Great Western Main Line was built through Southcote. The following year the Reading to Basingstoke line opened to the east of Southcote; the railways diverging at Southcote Junction. Two years later, in 1850, a water pumping station was built alongside the Kennet and Avon Canal at Southcote Lock. The facility, owned by the Reading Corporation, was connected to the Bath Road Reservoir ( north-east) and provided Reading with a source of water that originated upstream of any pollutants from the town.

In 1860 the occupant was Louisa Mundy, widow of Lieutenant Governor of Jersey Godfrey Mundy. Louisa was the niece of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon, and lived at Southcote with her sons Herbert and Cyril. By this time, Southcote had expanded to a population of 87, with 14 houses. In his &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot;, John Marius Wilson stated that the real property of Southcote was valued at £608.

After the Mundys&#x27; tenure, Southcote Manor was let to the Brisco (or Briscoe) family, who had made their money in slave trading and plantation ownership. The family were relatives of Hastings MP Musgrave Brisco and inheritors of the Pryce baronetcy. Along with one of his labourers, James Wastel Brisco was taken to court in Reading in 1874, charged with the &quot;assault with intent to ravish&quot; a 13-year-old servant girl. During the trial, the &quot;Reading Observer&quot; reported that &quot;several rumours were in circulation that a person connected with the case had committed suicide&quot;. Brisco supposedly used his wealth and social status to dissuade witnesses from testifying and the case was apparently abandoned.

Brisco was eccentric and wealthy, and added a ballroom to the building in 1891, replacing a timber chapel. He also began construction of the house&#x27;s distinctive tower the same year but died before it was complete and building work was abandoned.

=== 20th century ===

The manor of Southcote remained in the Blagrave family until the early 20th century, when it was owned by Henry Barry Blagrave. Henry died in 1927, though the manor house was demolished in 1921 after lying empty following the death of Wastel Brisco and his wife Sarah in 1891 and 1901 respectively. In 1920 the house had been purchased by a contractor with intentions to demolish the site, though the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a committee to attempt to raise money to save the house. &quot;The Sphere&quot; reported that the bricks and oak panelling were in demand and were likely removed for re-use before the building&#x27;s demolition.

In 1908 Reading Central Goods railway station was opened on the Coley branch line diverting at Southcote Junction. During the first few decades of the 20th century, however, most of Southcote remained rural and undeveloped. An Ordnance Survey map of 1914 shows the majority of land as agricultural (farms and nurseries) with a number of gravel pits and smithies. The 1930s saw the construction of the Southcote Park Estate, a housing estate built on land inherited after the death of William Berkeley Monck of Coley Park. An Ordnance Survey map of 1938 shows greater provision for the population (as opposed to industry); some of the gravel pits no longer existed and Presentation College, a boys&#x27; school, had opened in two large Victorian buildings—Rotherfield Grange and Oakland Hall, the latter a suburban villa built in the 1870s. By the advent of World War II, Southcote had begun to experience urban sprawl from Reading and the land bordering the Great Western Railway had begun to be used for housing. Following the war, Denton&#x27;s Field on the Bath Road in Southcote was used for celebratory events; Battle of Britain commemorative fêtes were held in September 1949 and 1950, and featured a performance by three Alsatians—Rocky, Lindy and Irma—to recognise their work in the war. Denton&#x27;s Field gained reputation as a location for outdoor community events, and was comparable to places such as Caversham Park and Palmer Park.

In the 1950s, a huge building project centred around Coronation Square (named for the 1953 Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II) with hundreds of council houses built to satisfy post-war demand. The residents of many of these had moved from houses in central and east Reading that fell short of sanitation requirements of the Public Health Act 1875, were compulsorily purchased and later demolished.

The gatehouse at Southcote Manor stood until the 1960s, when a fire broke out. It was demolished by 1964 to make way for housing. Reading Central Goods station was closed in 1983, and with it the branch line from Southcote ceased to operate. Two years later the track bed and sleepers were removed.

The same decade a campaign was started to raise £1 million to save the decaying mansion in Prospect Park; in 1986 the building was described as &quot;crumbling&quot; and &quot;likely to be demolished&quot;, though plans existed to convert the building into offices. In the 1990s, however, the building was renovated and re-opened as a restaurant.

In 2004, Presentation College went into administration. It was taken over by the Society of Licensed Victuallers and renamed The Elvian School. The school closed in 2010. Following its closure, Taylor Wimpey applied to build 193 new homes on the site, competing with a proposal by a community group (the West Reading Education Network) to reopen the site as a free school known as the WREN. The housing plan was rejected, but Taylor Wimpey then appealed to Reading Borough Council and submitted a revised plan for 120 homes, which left room for the school. The appeal was taken to the High Court, which ruled that the site should be used solely for education; the school opened for Year Seven pupils on 7 September 2015.

== Government ==

=== Local elections ===
Southcote forms an electoral ward of the Reading Central constituency, and has three seats on Reading Borough Council. It is seen as a safe seat for the Labour Party; the Conservative Party last won a council seat in Southcote in 1987. The current three councillors are Debs Edwards, John Ennis and Matt Lawrence. The most recent election was held in 2016, which saw Edwards re-elected. The ward has seen three by-elections: in 2006, in 2014 when Lawrence was elected following Pete Ruhemann&#x27;s death, and in 2016 when Lawrence resigned from councillorship. The seat, which was contested by candidates from Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and the Conservatives, was held by the Labour party who gained 63.7% of votes.

Like all wards in Reading, the boundaries of Southcote ward were redrawn in 2004. The ward holds elections by thirds—three seats are available, and in three years in every four, one seat comes up for election.

==== Elected councillors ====
Incumbent councillors are listed in bold.

=== Community government ===
Southcote has a number of action groups, including the Southcote Residents&#x27; Association (for general residents&#x27; interests), the Southcote Neighbourhood Action Group (for a police and council relations), and Southcote Globe (for environmental issues). Southcote Park Estate, a large area of semi-detached housing on unadopted roads built in 1933, has an elected volunteer committee.

== Geography ==
Southcote, as a ward, is bounded to the north by Norcot, to the north-east by Battle, to the east by Coley and to the south-east by Whitley. To the south, south-west and west Southcote forms the boundary between the Reading and West Berkshire. The boundaries of Southcote are formed by Calcot Park to the north-west, the northern edge of Prospect Park to the north, the Reading to Basingstoke railway line to the east and by channels of the River Kennet to the south. The western boundary runs through housing in the Fords Farm area.
Beyond the south-west and western boundaries, in West Berkshire, are the wards of Burghfield and Calcot.

Less formally, Southcote is bordered by the settlements of Horncastle and Fords Farm to the west, Tilehurst to the north, West Reading to the north east, Coley to the east, Whitley to the south-east and Pingewood to the south.

=== Topography ===
Southcote is bordered to the south by the Holy Brook and the River Kennet; as such much of the land in the south of the area is floodplain. The proximity of Southcote to the river has led to flooding of roads and residences, particularly during the 2013–2014 United Kingdom winter floods. Flooding is exacerbated by the routes of the Holy Brook and railway line; the railway crosses the stream by bridges and culverts and in some locations the embankment acts as a bund, inhibiting the dissipation of floodwater. Similarly, a report by West Berkshire Council found that during the 2013–14 floods the single track road between the Holy Brook and the Kennet at Southcote Mill &quot;acted as a barrier until the rising waters backing up in the flood plain fields finally breached&quot;.
Network Rail&#x27;s plans for electrification of the Great Western Main Line include provision for flood defences where the line is in proximity to the Holy Brook.

The elevation of Southcote ranges from almost in the north-west extreme of the ward (SRTM data records this as , Ordnance Survey as ) to approximately in the floodplains north and south of the Kennet.

=== Geology ===
The geology of Southcote includes the Reading Formation—rock strata in the Lambeth Group consisting of clay, silt and sand formed in the Palaeogene period. Bedrock in Southcote is also formed of chalk, with geological surveys also finding flint samples. A map produced by the Geological Survey of Great Britain in 1860 identifies the area as being predominantly Plastic Clay (now known as the Lambeth Group) and chalk north of the river, with flint and gravel samples typical of the Bagshot Formation south of the Kennet. More specifically, the 2000 survey showed different types of gravel, including Winter Hill (variably clayey and sandy), Lynch Hill (sand and gravel with lenses of silt, clay or peat), and head (a polymict deposit usually formed by periglacial solifluction or gelifluction). The survey also identified that much of the land south of the Kennet is &quot;infilled&quot; or &quot;worked&quot; ground; this area was formerly gravel pits and now used for leisure. The British Geological Survey defines infilled ground as &quot;areas where the ground has been cut away then wholly or partially backfilled&quot; and worked ground as &quot;areas where the ground has been cut away such as quarries and road cuttings&quot;.

=== Built environment ===

The settlement is concentrated to the south of the Bath Road (A4). Southcote consists substantially of planned post-war housing, much of which is Wates-constructed prefabricated housing. The majority of dwellings are semi-detached, which account for 37.7% of all residences. 29.1% of dwellings are flats, and 23.5% are terraces. Reading&#x27;s first high-rise dwellings—three eight-storey tower blocks—were built in Southcote in the late 1950s. Home ownership in Southcote is 58.3%, which is average for the Reading area. Use of social housing is above the local average at 29.2%.

Southcote&#x27;s main thoroughfare is Southcote Lane which runs east–west through the area, connecting Southcote to Fords Farm (to the west) and Coley (to the east). Southcote is centred around Coronation Square, an area of open grassland surrounded by community facilities and commercial premises.
To the north of the Bath Road is Prospect Park, a large urban park surrounding the Mansion House. Development to the south of Southcote is restricted by the Holy Brook and the Great Western Main Line, and although the land is used for recreation, proposals are occasionally put forward to build housing on the floodplains. The land south of the railway line is subject to a Tree Preservation Order (TPO). This land is defined by Reading Borough Council as Southcote Meadows, and stretches from the Burghfield Road (near to the western boundary of Southcote) to Milkmaid&#x27;s Bridge at the foot of Southcote Lock. Other parts of Southcote are subject to similar restrictions, including areas adjacent to (but north of) the railway embankment, trees lining the Kennet and Avon Canal west of Southcote Lock, and various individual sites.

=== Parks and open spaces ===
Prospect Park, one of the largest open spaces in Reading, is in Southcote Ward. Smaller parks such as Linear Park and Southcote Farm Lane playground are in the community. Coronation Square is a designated green space in the centre of Southcote.

Bordering Prospect Park is Devil&#x27;s Dip, a former gravel and clay pit. The site is recognised by Reading Borough Council as an area of wildlife and historical interest, and examples of elm, walnut, ash, horse chestnut and sycamore trees grow there. Other flora found at the site include nettle, bramble and elder, with flowers such as lesser celandine, bluebells and Queen Anne&#x27;s lace appearing in the spring. Peacock butterflies and various species of woodland bird are prevalent in the area.

== Demography ==
According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, the population of the Southcote area was 8,548, of which 48% were male and 52% female. This is an increase of 58 residents compared to the 2001 census. Censuses before this cannot be compared, as the ward boundaries (and therefore population) changed after the 1991 census.

The majority of residents of Southcote Ward (58.6%) identify as Christian, with people specifying &quot;no religion&quot; counting for 24.9% of the population. The second most prevalent religion in Southcote is Islam, with 6% of people identifying as Muslim. The vast majority of Southcote residents (73.4%) are White British; the Reading average is 65%. Almost one in twenty (4.3%) of residents identify as Black African, 4% of mixed heritage, 3% Pakistani, 3% Indian and 2% Black Caribbean. 82.9% of the population in Southcote were born in the UK, and 91.3% speak English as their first language. 1.5% of residents do not speak English well.

The life expectancy in Southcote is 77.5 years for males—lower than the national estimate of 78.3—and the expectancy for females (82.6 years) is slightly higher than the national estimate (82.3 years).

The census counted Southcote in Reading&#x27;s labour market, where 75.6% of the population is deemed as economically active. 71.9% of the population are engaged in employment, and 6.5% are classified as unemployed. Out-of-work benefit payments (such as Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance, incapacity, lone parent, disability and carer benefits) in Southcote are higher than the Reading average.

80.2% of Southcote&#x27;s residence evaluate their health as &quot;good&quot;, although this is lower than the Reading average of 85.5%.

== Economy ==
Historically the land at Southcote was used for farming and gravel extraction. Farms such as Calvespit Farm (), Honey End Farm (), Southcote Manor Farm (), and Southcote Farm () were in the area. The 1888 Kelly&#x27;s Directory lists some residents of Southcote Lane as being employed as coachmen, butlers, gardeners, labourers, florists, dairy farmers, thatchers and s. One resident was a member of the county police, and Major-General C J Addington resided at Southcote Lodge. An Ordnance Survey map surveyed in the 1870s also identifies a vinery and kennels.

The farming and gravel industries declined with the expansion of Reading after the Second World War, though the existence of the anti-extraction groups &quot;Save Southcote Meadows&quot; and &quot;Residents Against Gravel Extraction&quot; (RAGE) in the 1980s suggests the demand for such industry in the area remained. By the mid-1980s, the Tarmac Group reportedly owned land near the site of Southcote Manor with the intent of extracting gravel there.

There are two primary centres of economic activity in Southcote—Coronation Square and Southcote Farm Lane. Coronation Square is home to a number of commercial and community premises, including a post office, takeaway food outlets, newsagents, healthcare businesses and a pet shop; as well as a community centre and library. The square also featured a public house until its demolition in 2011; the land was subsequently used for affordable housing.
Southcote Farm Lane has a small parade of shops and businesses including a convenience store and hairdressers.
On the border of Southcote and Tilehurst is the Meadway Precinct, which includes a supermarket, pharmacy, as well as other smaller shops. The precinct opened in 1967, and a survey in 2012 revealed that the public thought the site had become run-down and required modernisation. In 2015 a planning application was submitted to Reading Borough Council by a developer who plans to renovate the site.

== Culture and community ==
In the years following the Second World War, Southcote hosted a number of community events on Denton&#x27;s Field. Many of these fêtes included grasstrack motorcycle racing events, which were held in 1947, 1948 and 1949. Speedway stars Bill Kitchen and George Wilks raced at Southcote in 1949 for a Conservative Party fête. The field was also used in 1949 for a gymkhana and a church fundraising fête.

Southcote holds an annual May fayre in Coronation Square; the 2015 event was organised by community groups from local churches and community centres. The event focuses on cuisine, live music and children&#x27;s entertainment.

The Reading branch of the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust meet at Southcote for talks and meetings, and undertake maintenance work on the canal through the Southcote area.

=== Public services ===
Southcote is within Thames Valley Police&#x27;s catchment, and is grouped as a neighbourhood with Norcot. Residents identified nuisance and illegal parking and excessive speed as of concern in the area, as well as the antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath. Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, signs were installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way.

The majority of reported crime in Southcote is categorised as either violent or sexual attacks, where 46 incidents of this nature were reported in June 2015 within a radius of Coronation Square. The highest concentration of crime occurs near the service station on the A4 road. Neighbourhood liaison sessions (known as &quot;Have Your Say&quot; meetings) are held in Coronation Square.

A surgery, operated by the Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, is located at the junction of Circuit Lane and Southcote Lane. In late 2014 the practice was the subject of significant local media coverage when all five of the surgery&#x27;s general practitioners resigned. Other NHS facilities in Southcote include Prospect Park Hospital (catering for in-patient mental health and psychiatric intensive care) and the Dutchess of Kent Hospice, which is also part of the Sue Ryder group. The NHS&#x27;s North and West Reading Clinical Commissioning Group&#x27;s headquarters is located in Southcote on the Bath Road.

Southcote has a number of council-funded community facilities, including a library, a community centre, and a children&#x27;s centre. A number of community organisations, such as an elderly residents&#x27; social club, litter picking groups, and allotments are in existence in the area. Reading&#x27;s RESCUE (Rivers and Environmental Spaces Clean-Up Event), a rural litter-picking initiative, operates periodically in the parks and along the tracks and towpaths in Southcote.

== Transport ==

Southcote is situated north of the M4 Motorway, approximately halfway between junctions 11 (Reading central) and 12 (Reading west).

The Reading to Taunton branch of the Great Western Mainline railway bisects Southcote laterally. At the eastern boundary of the settlement is Southcote Junction, where the Reading to Taunton and Reading to Basingstoke Lines diverge. A third line—the Coley branch line—ran from the junction until its closure in the 1980s. There are a number of Brunel-designed brick arch bridges along the Reading to Taunton line through Southcote, two of which have been described as &quot;notably well preserved examples&quot; and are designated &quot;heritage assets&quot; by Network Rail. A third bridge, which carries the main Burghfield to Reading road, may have originally been timber before being replaced with a steel deck by the Great Western Railway company.

Southcote is linked to Reading by a number of Reading Buses services along the A4 Bath Road, with some services stopping within Southcote itself. One service, named &quot;Jet Black&quot;, links Reading to Newbury via Southcote.

The Kennet and Avon Canal at Southcote is still used for pleasure boating; moorings for narrowboats are located between Southcote Lock and Burghfield Bridge. The canal is accessible from footpaths near Burghfield Bridge, Southcote Mill and Fobney Lock, and the towpath through Southcote is a designated portion of National Cycle Route 4.

During the First World War, an aerodrome was established near to Southcote at Coley Park. Aviator Henri Salmet based himself at Woodley Aerodrome, from which he gave &quot;joyrides&quot; in his Blériot Aéronautique aeroplane, but also gave flights in a Blériot XI from the Kennet meadows in Southcote.
In 1915 a Farman aeroplane crash-landed at Southcote Farm next to Southcote Junction. The pilot was able to jump from the plane before it crashed, and ran alongside it until it collided with a hedge near the railway embankment.

== Education ==
Three primary schools are situated in Southcote—Manor Primary School, Holy Brook Special Educational Needs School, and Southcote Primary School. In each of their most recent Ofsted inspections, the schools achieved a &quot;good&quot; rating.

Three secondary schools are in operation in Southcote. King&#x27;s Academy Prospect is a specialist sport and ICT school run under the academy system. In its latest Ofsted report, the school was judged to require improvement.
The other secondary school in Southcote is The Blessed Hugh Faringdon Catholic School, a Catholic school named after the Reading abbot Hugh Cook alias Faringdon. The school was deemed to be &quot;good&quot; in its latest Ofsted inspection. In September 2015, the third school —The Wren School— opened on the site of the former Elvian School. This operates as a free school, and was envisaged by a volunteer network after Reading Borough Council identified a shortfall in school capacity in 2012.

Educational attainment in Southcote is lower than the Reading and national average. 47% of students at GCSE (or equivalent) attain five or more A* to C passes, compared to the Reading figure of 57% and 61% nationally. The number of students achieving Level 2 writing at Key Stage 1 is 83%—the same as in the wider Reading area—though the national percentage is higher at 85%. Overall, the proportion of Southcote residents with no qualifications is higher than Reading.

Based at Stoneham Court, within the grounds of Prospect School, is the headquarters (and central Berkshire base) of the Berkshire Maestros music school.

== Religious sites ==

Southcote is in the Reading Deanery of the Diocese of Oxford. Southcote&#x27;s Anglican church is dedicated to St Matthew. A United Reformed Church was built in 1958, shortly after the Southcote housing estate became occupied, and a Christian Mission was established in Southcote in 1965. The Catholic Church of English Martyrs is situated adjacent to Prospect Park at the northernmost boundary of Southcote ward.
The Kennet Valley Free Church is just beyond the Southcote—Fords Farm boundary.

Provision for other faiths is found closer to Reading town centre and in East Reading.

== Sport ==
Southcote&#x27;s main football club is Southcote Colts. The under-13 team won the 2014–15 East Berkshire Third Division without being beaten.
The under-14 and under-16 teams both currently play in their respective Premier Division of the Peter Houseman Youth League. The under-15 team is currently in the &quot;A&quot; league of the Oxford Mail Youth Football League.

<text>Coley is an inner-town district near the centre of the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire. It is often referred to as Old Coley, to distinguish it from the adjacent, and much more recent, suburb of Coley Park.

The district has no formal boundaries, but the historically the name referred to the area roughly bounded by Castle Street, Castle Hill and the Bath Road to the north, Berkeley Avenue to the south and west, and the River Kennet and Bridge Street to the east. Coley is bordered to its south and west by Coley Park, to its north by West Reading, and to its east by Katesgrove and the Inner Distribution Road.

The district lies entirely within the borough of Reading, within Coley, Abbey and Katesgrove wards. It is within the Central Reading Parliamentary Constituency. 

Coley is split between the Church of England parishes of All Saints Church and St Giles&#x27; Church, although neither church is actually within the district.

The Berkshire Record Office is located in Coley Avenue near to the junction with Bath Road.

Along with Coley Park it was formerly land owned by the Vachell family from about 1300 to its sale in 1727. The estate then passed to the Thompson family until 1791, and then William Chamberlayne until 1809. Chamberlayne was responsible for selling off the land then known as Pinkney&#x27;s Mead, close to the town centre. This was obtained piecemeal by small local developers who built tiny, densely packed cottages on the site for the growing population of Reading. 

Coley formerly had a railway goods yard, the Reading Central Goods station, which was connected to the main line at Southcote Junction by the Coley branch line.

Phoebe Cusden, a notable socialist, peace campaigner and Mayor of Reading, lived all her life in Coley. In 1977 she published &quot;Coley: Portrait of an Urban Village&quot;, a history of the suburb.

Old Coley housed one of Reading&#x27;s largest slum communities, built in the area between Wolseley St and Castle St. Centred around the Coley Steps, courts and back-to-back housing accommodated a population of about 1,500. The slums were eventually cleared in the 1930s, with residents rehoused in the new council estates of Whitley and Norcot. In 1989 the Coley Local History Group recorded the memories of its residents in two publications &quot;Talking of Coley&quot; (, 1990) and &quot;More Talking of Coley&quot; (1991). These were combined, extended and reissued in 2021 as &quot;Coley Talking&quot; (ISBN 9781909747883) (Two Rivers Press)

<doc id="1264185" wikidata="Q8021139" url="?curid=1264185" title="Williamsbridge, Bronx">
<text>Williamsbridge is a neighborhood geographically located in the north-central portion of the Bronx in New York City. Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise are East 222nd Street to the north, Boston Road to the east, East Gun Hill Road to the south, and the Bronx River to the west. White Plains Road is the primary thoroughfare through Williamsbridge.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 12 and its ZIP Codes include 10466, 10467, and 10469. The area is patrolled by the 47th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 8 at 2794 Randall Avenue in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx.

== History ==
According to the New York City Parks Department, Williamsbridge was named for 18th Century farmer John Williams, who had a farm on the east bank of the Bronx River in the vicinity of Gun Hill Road and White Plains Road, and was credited with building the first bridge over the Bronx River. It incorporated as a village on November 23, 1888.

Olinville, named for Methodist Episcopal minister Stephen Olin, is a disused neighborhood name for the area around Olinville Avenue in Williamsbridge. However, the name &quot;Olinville&quot; survives in four telephone exchanges — OLinville 2, 3, 4, and 5 — which can still be found in the neighborhood (as 652, 653, 654 and 655).

=== Planned zoning changes ===
The New York City Department of City Planning has proposed zoning map changes for 36 blocks in the Williamsbridge/Olinville area. The proposed zoning would preserve the area&#x27;s lower density residential character and promote new development in keeping with the scale of the surrounding neighborhood. In addition, the DCP is proposing a zoning text amendment establishing a new citywide R5A district to address the unique detached housing stock found within this neighborhood.

The area&#x27;s development patterns, although varied, are characterized by distinct enclaves of detached, semi-detached, and attached residential buildings, as well as a smaller number of mid and high-rise apartment buildings. However, the height and density of existing housing is generally lower than is permitted under the current zoning. Clusters of one- and two-family homes are prevalent in many parts of Williamsbridge and few buildings are higher than 70 feet, even in the more densely developed portions of the neighborhood. The proposed rezonings aim to address this zoning mismatch by ensuring that new development is of a density and scale compatible with the low-rise/low-density character of this community.

==Demographics==

<doc id="1264189" wikidata="Q3265728" url="?curid=1264189" title="Tower Records">
<text>Tower Records is an international retail franchise and online music store that was formerly based in Sacramento, California, United States. From 1960 until 2006, Tower operated retail stores in the United States, which closed when Tower Records filed for bankruptcy and liquidation. Tower Records was purchased by a separate entity and was not affected by the retail store closings.

On November 13, 2020, Tower Records announced that it had returned as an online retailer with plans to open future physical locations.

==History==
===Inception, expansion, and description===
In 1960, Russell Solomon opened the first Tower Records store on Broadway, in Sacramento, California. He named it after his father&#x27;s drugstore, which shared a building and name with the Tower Theatre, where Solomon first started selling records. The first stand-alone Tower Records store was located at 2514 Watt Ave in the Arden Arcade area of Sacramento. By 1976, Solomon had opened Tower Books, Posters, and Plants at 1600 Broadway, next door to another Sacramento Tower Records location. In 1995, Tower.com opened, making the enterprise one of the first retailers to move online.

Seven years after its founding, Tower Records expanded to San Francisco, opening a store in what was originally a grocery store at Bay Street and Columbus Avenue. In 1979, Tower Records in Japan started its business as the Japan Branch of MTS Incorporated. The following year, Sapporo Store, the first in Japan and internationally, opened. The chain eventually expanded internationally to include stores in the United Kingdom, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Ireland, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Argentina. The Tower Records stores in Japan split off from the main chain and are now independent. 

Arguably the most famous Tower Records outlet was the purpose-built building that company staff general-contracted, with many personally contributing their labor, which opened in 1971 on the northwest corner of Sunset Boulevard and Horn Avenue in West Hollywood.

In New York City, Tower Records operated a suite of stores on and near lower Broadway in Greenwich Village. The main store was located at the southeast corner of East 4th Street and Broadway. The Tower Records Annex was in the same building, located at the southwest corner of East 4th and Lafayette Street. The third store, Tower Video, was located on the southeast corner of East 4th and Lafayette Street, and specialized in video and the second floor of this location also sold books. Their location on the Upper West Side, near Lincoln Center on 66th Street and Broadway, was a magnet for those working in the field of musical theatre. There was also a location in the basement of Trump Tower, and a small clearance annex on 86th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

The Nashville location on West End Avenue (across from Vanderbilt University) was in a former Packard dealership. The old showroom floor in front was devoted to CDs, cassettes and vinyl. The area in the back housed videocassette sales and rentals, PC and console games and music paraphernalia. The strip mall next door contained a separate Tower Books. The location was famous for their late-night Monday events that culminated at midnight on Tuesday when staff started ringing up sales of new releases. Because of the store&#x27;s proximity to Music Row, country music stars could occasionally be seen performing or shopping there.
As part of a 2002 settlement with 41 states over CD price fixing Tower Records, along with retailers Musicland and Trans World Entertainment, agreed to pay a $3 million (~$ in ) fine. It is estimated that between 1995 and 2000 customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album.

In 2005, the company began using &quot;scan and listen&quot; stations in its stores. These stations allowed customers to listen to audio samples from CDs and to search for particular songs, albums and artists. In the years that followed, this model of listening station was still used at the Arizona-based chain Zia Records.

In 2006, the company introduced the Tower Insider program. The program was free of charge and allowed a customer to receive a membership card that could be scanned with each purchase, allowing the customer to receive coupons and notification of special deals via e-mail.

In addition to compact discs and cassette tapes, the stores sold DVDs, electronic gadgets like mp3 players, video games, accessories, and toys, and a few Tower Records locations sold books as well, such as those in Fremont, Brea, Mountain View, and Sacramento, California, as well as stores in Austin, Boston, Massachusetts, Nashville, New York City, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle and Bellevue, Washington.

=== &quot;Pulse!&quot; magazine===
In 1983, the company began publishing a music magazine, &quot;Pulse!&quot;, which contained record reviews, interviews, and advertising. Initially, it was given away free in their stores to promote their record sales. After nine years, in 1992, the magazine began national distribution with a cover price of $2.95, (~$ in ) but it was canceled when the company discontinued U.S. operations. From 1983 until December 2002 Tower Records published it monthly, 222 issues in all.

===Bankruptcy===
Tower Records entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the first time in 2004. Factors cited were the heavy debt incurred during its aggressive expansion in the 1990s, growing competition from mass discounters and Internet piracy. Mismanagement, managerial incompetence, and crippling restrictions from the first bankruptcy deal also contributed to Tower&#x27;s demise.

Some observers took a pragmatic view. As Robert Moog, inventor of the Moog synthesizer, has stated: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry if Tower Records&#x27; and Blockbuster&#x27;s sales plummet. On the other hand, it wasn&#x27;t that long ago that those megastore chains drove a lot of neighborhood record stores out of business.&quot;

In February 2004, the debt was estimated to be between $80 million and $100 million, and assets totaled just over $100 million.

On August 20, 2006, Tower Records filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time, in order to facilitate a purchase of the company prior to the holiday shopping season.

===Liquidation===
On October 6, 2006, Great American Group won an auction of the company&#x27;s assets and commenced liquidation proceedings the following day. This included going-out-of-business sales at all U.S. Tower Records locations, the last of which closed on December 22, 2006. The Tower Records website was sold separately to Caiman Inc.

The managers of f.y.e., a music store chain based in shopping malls, had negotiated a deal to acquire the two historic Tower locations in the latter&#x27;s home base of Sacramento. f.y.e. later backed out, stating that the &quot;leases aren&#x27;t what we thought they were&quot;. f.y.e. did acquire the lease of the West End Avenue store in Nashville, which eventually closed in 2011. f.y.e. also took over Tower Records in Torrance, which continued to operate until early 2016.

Rasputin Music, a new and used music and video store based in the San Francisco Bay Area, expanded in the Central Valley of California by acquiring the leases for the former Tower Records stores in Fresno and Stockton.

== Other stores ==

The Landmark Plaza Tower Records Store in Alexandria, Virginia was permanently closed on December 18, 2006, and the Tysons Corner, Virginia, store permanently closed on December 21, 2006. The noted 24-year-old store in Washington, D.C. (Foggy Bottom) closed down the next day, as did the store in Atlanta, Georgia.

On Friday, December 22, 2006 – 40 years after Solomon had opened the first Tower Records store in Sacramento – the last Tower Records store in New York City, located at 1961 Broadway, one block north of Lincoln Center, on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side, closed permanently along with all of the other remaining Tower Records stores in the United States. The final Tower Records store (in the Pacific Time Zone) to be closed was the one in Mountain View, which closed at 5:00 p.m. 

One building in Sacramento had been a Tower Records store for 40 years, and the lot across the street had been the location where Solomon began selling records in 1941.

R5 Records closed on June 4, 2010, and was sold to rival Dimple Records, which reopened the store in mid-July 2010. Dimple Records closed all of its locations in 2019.

The Tower Records building in Boston, located at the intersection of Newbury Street and Massachusetts Avenue, was instrumental in the conversion of the former street&#x27;s commercial value. The eight-story building, renovated by Frank Gehry in the late 80s, is prominently visible from the eastbound Massachusetts Turnpike. The store (which occupied the first five stories) featured gold stars of Boston artists (including Gang Starr, New Kids on the Block, and Yo-Yo Ma) embedded in the front landing. Virgin Megastore took over the store from 2002 to 2007. The space was later a Best Buy store and, after being vacant for some time, in 2016 was opened as a T.J. Maxx store.

===Online return===
Online merchant Caiman, Inc., reopened the website from Montreal, Quebec, on June 1, 2007. This company also announced plans to reopen the stores themselves—opening stores in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco within the next nine months, however this never came to fruition. They hired former Tower buyer Kevin Hawkins to assist with the re-opening (Hawkins, along with former Tower employee George Scarlett, then left Caiman). In 2009, Richard Flynn was hired as President. The website remained based in Montreal, but the relaunch of the brand never moved forward.

As of November 2020, Tower Records re-opened their online store with a new website, once again selling vinyl records among other merchandise, which also features an online version of &quot;Pulse&quot; that is updated regularly.

===Tower Labs===
In October 2022, Tower Labs was opened in Brooklyn, New York, marking the first physical iteration of the brand since 2006. &quot;The intention of Tower Labs is for artists and bands to host personal gatherings with their community, similar to a backstage experience,&quot; says Tower Records&#x27; new president, Danny Zeijdel. &quot;In an increasingly digital world, it is imperative for artists to have a physical space where they can connect and create.&quot; Tower Labs is a creative space, as the brand continues to explore the potential reopening of a flagship retail location.

== International stores ==
=== Argentina ===
Tower Records operated nine stores in Argentina in Buenos Aires, Pilar, San Isidro, Puerto Madryn, Córdoba, and La Plata. It opened its first store in 1997 and closed its last in 2006.

=== Canada ===
Tower Records operated in Canada in the mid-1990s with a flagship store at the Toronto Eaton Centre at the corner of Queen and Yonge which opened in December 1995 and closed in 2001. Tower Records opened a second location in Toronto in the late nineties at Empress Walk in North York, also on Yonge Street, but it was closed just prior to the flagship store closing.

=== Hong Kong ===
Tower Records opened stores in Hong Kong in the 1990s. There were two stores, one located on the seventh floor of Times Square at Causeway Bay, the other at Diamond Hill.

=== Ireland ===
Tower Records is operated in Ireland by Record &amp; Discs Ltd. (owned by Eclective) under a licensed franchise of MTS Incorporated (USA). , two stores still operate in Ireland both located in Dublin, one on Dawson Street and the other on O&#x27;Connell Street upstairs in Easons.

=== Israel ===
Tower Records Israel opened in 1993; a joint venture between Tower Records USA (MTS INC of W. Sacramento, CA) and two local businessmen. The Founding Director was Joel Abramson, who had previously managed Tower&#x27;s flagship Sunset Strip location in Los Angeles. The first three locations were in Tel Aviv (the Opera Tower), Haifa (Hutzot HaMifratz, opened in early 1995) and Jerusalem (1995). The Tel Aviv location, with its beachfront location, was a popular shopping spot for Israeli pop stars like David Broza, Meir Ariel, Aviv Gefen, Riki Gal and others. TRI closed its final location in Ra&#x27;anana in November 2015.

=== Japan ===

In 1979, Tower Records in Japan started its business as the Japan Branch of MTS Incorporated. The following year, Sapporo Store, the first in Japan, opened. In 1981, Japanese subsidiary Tower Records Japan Inc. (TRJ) was established. 

In October 2002, TRJ went independent from the international chain by management buyout. The bankruptcy of Tower Records in the U.S. in 2006 did not affect TRJ because it had been completely independent (as of 2015, NTT DoCoMo and Seven &amp; I Holdings are the main stakeholders). As of October 1, 2014, TRJ maintains 85 directly operated store locations throughout Japan, including 10 Tower Mini Stores and the Shibuya Store in Tokyo (moved to the current location in March 1995), which is said to be one of the biggest music retail outlets in the world, occupying selling space of 5,000 m² (9 floors). TRJ also publishes the free magazines &quot;Tower&quot;, &quot;bounce&quot;, and &quot;intoxicate&quot; directly and through its subsidiary NMNL. In 2014, Tower Records launched the music review website Mikiki, which also posts content from the previously mentioned magazines.

In addition to being the leading CD retailer in Japan, TRJ was the majority stakeholder in Napster Japan, a joint venture between TRJ and Napster LLC. On March 1, 2010, Napster Japan and TRJ announced that Napster Japan would terminate all of its services on May 31, 2010, due to the difficulty in covering the costs of maintaining the required systems to continue the services.

Tower Records Japan has a subsidiary record label called T-Palette Records, which specializes in idol performers.

=== Mexico ===
The first Tower Records store in Mexico opened in the mid-1990s in the Zona Rosa area featuring 3 floors and a live DJ. After international bankruptcy, the stores were acquired by Promotora Musical, a retail company owned by Grupo Carso, the same owner of Mixup record stores. There were Tower Records stores in Mexico City (Gran Sur, Altavista and Mundo E), and Monterrey (Paseo San Pedro). , but eventually closed. The store in Puebla (Las Animas) currently operates.

=== Philippines ===
Tower Records opened three stores in the Philippines in the 1990s. The first branch was located in Glorietta 3 Ayala Center Makati City which opened in 1998. The second store was in Alabang Town Center Muntinlupa City which opened in 1999. The third store was in Robinson&#x27;s Place Manila, all of which are in the National Capital Region. As of 2018, all these branches have closed.

In 2020, Tower Records Philippines has been re-launched and re-opened because of Filipino girl group Baby Blue, a sub-unit of idol girl group MNL48.

=== Singapore ===
Tower Records opened stores in Singapore in the 1990s. Singapore had two Tower Records outlets, one at Pacific Plaza that opened in 1993 and the other at Suntec City. Tower Records Pacific Plaza moved out in 2001 and the latter closed its doors in 2006 when Tower Records filed for bankruptcy globally and eventually folded.

=== South Korea ===
Tower Records opened stores in South Korea in the 1990s, with stores in Seoul and Busan. The Seoul branch became part of Synnara Record (now Media Synnara) and is now part of M2U Record, while the Busan branch has closed.

The Seoul branch was used as one of the main filming locations for Seoul Broadcasting System&#x27;s 2001 drama &quot;Beautiful Days&quot;, starring Lee Byung-hun, Choi Ji-woo, Ryu Si-won, Shin Min-a, Lee Jung-hyun and Lee Yoo-jin.

=== Taiwan ===
Tower Records opened three megastores in Taipei, Taiwan in the 1990s. All stores were located in popular areas of Taipei, and became centers of fashion and music during their existence. The stores closed in December 2003.

=== Thailand ===
Tower Records opened stores in Thailand in the 1990s, introducing comprehensive music CD stocking into Thailand for the first time with revolutionary effects on the retail music business. There were several stores in Bangkok, including three megastores inside popular malls. One of the biggest megastores was located on the top floor of CentralWorld mall in central Bangkok. In the 2000s as business declined due to piracy and the downloading revolution, the stores were progressively closed and the remaining ones were eventually sold to another dealer.

=== United Kingdom ===
Tower Records in the UK was originally a London-based concern, with a first store in Kensington High Street in 1984 being followed the next year by a flagship outlet at 9 Piccadilly Circus and later two more smaller outlets at Whiteleys in Bayswater, and Kingston. However, by the start of the 1990s the chain had grown to encompass a number of other stores, with large entertainment stores also selling movies, books, magazines and games in Birmingham and Glasgow, as well as a number of smaller stores that had been purchased from rival American retailer Sam Goody when it had left the UK marketplace (an example of this express format was in Weston-super-Mare).

However, with tough trading conditions in the UK market, as well as the company&#x27;s trouble in the States, the firm followed Sam Goody in retreating from the UK market. The London stores in Piccadilly and Kensington were sold to Virgin Group in 2003, who for a while traded under the Tower brand at the former site until the store could be fully refurbished, while the other stores were closed. The store was subsequently renamed Zavvi in September 2007 after a management buyout of the Virgin Megastores. Zavvi entered administration in late 2008 and administrators closed the Piccadilly store on Wednesday, January 14, 2009.

==Documentaries==
The 2015 documentary &quot;All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records&quot; by filmmaker Colin Hanks chronicles the rise and fall of Tower Records, using archival footage and exclusive interviews with former staff, especially Russell Solomon and former COO Stan Goman, as well as celebrity customers Bruce Springsteen, Elton John and Dave Grohl.

Another documentary called &quot;Art Gods&quot; (2013) is an oral history of the development of an influential in-store display design ethic at Tower, originating from the Berkeley location.

<text>A swather (North America), or windrower (Australia and rest of world), is a farm implement that cuts hay or small grain crops and forms them into a windrow for drying.


They may be self-propelled with an engine, or drawn by a tractor and power take-off powered. A swather uses a reciprocating sickle bar or rotating discs to sever the crop stems. The reel helps cut crop fall neatly onto a canvas or auger conveyor which deposits it into a windrow with stems aligned and supported above the ground by the stubble.

A swather does the same task for hay crops as hand scything, cradling and swathing, or mowing and raking. Horizontal rollers behind the cutters may be used to crimp or condition the stems of hay crops to decrease drying time.

For grains, as combines replaced threshing machines, the swather introduced an optional step in the harvesting process to provide for the drying time that binding formerly afforded. Swathing is still more common in the northern United States and Canada than regions with longer growing seasons where standing grain crops can be harvested directly by combines. Some modern crop varieties capable of rapid maturity have reduced the need for swathing grains even in the north.

As well as accelerating drying of the ripe grain, windrowing the whole of the growing crop provides for a consistent ripening and dehydration of stalk and green weeds to assist in effective post threshing winnowing and separation of the grain and other material. Alternatively, chemical desiccation of weedy or irregularly ripe standing crops with glyphosate, paraquat or diquat has been used to enable direct combining.

A swather is the mascot of sports teams at Hesston High School in Hesston, Kansas. Hesston is home to AGCO Corporation swather and combine harvester manufacturing plants.

<doc id="1264202" wikidata="Q7015235" url="?curid=1264202" title="New Zealand Barbarians">
<text>The New Zealand Barbarian Rugby Club Inc., nicknamed the &quot;Barbarians&quot;, or &quot;Baa-Baas&quot;, is a rugby union club headquartered in Kingsland, Auckland. The idea came from the concept of the Barbarian F.C. The Barbarians played their home matches at Eden Park.

They have been a part of New Zealand Rugby since the team was founded in 1937 by two ex-All Blacks, Ronald Bush and Hubert McLean, who captained their first game (against Auckland) in 1938.

== Tours ==
=== Jubilee Tour Party 1987 ===
To mark the club&#x27;s 50th Jubilee, an unbeaten five-match tour to the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland was undertaken in March 1987, two months before the inaugural World Cup, where they recorded wins against Leicester (33-3), Wanderers (Dublin) (34-3), Ballymena (29-4), Cornwall (63-9). They also produced a devastating performance in Cardiff, beating the Barbarians 68-16. There were thirteen All Blacks in the party of 22 and a further six future caps, with Wayne Smith being drafted in from Italy as a replacement for one game. New Zealand were emerging from a turbulent 1986, the year of the rebel Cavaliers tour to South Africa and the &quot;Baby Blacks&quot; tests, the subsequent reintegration of the Cavaliers into the Bledisloe Cup games, and the infamous Battle of Nantes. Eight players who had survived November in Nantes toured, as did four Cavaliers.

* Management staff was: Peter Murdoch (Coach), Kevin Barry (Team Manager), D.E.Kirk (Auckland) Captain, Clive Murdoch (Masseur)
* Back Threes: G.J.L. Cooper (Auckland), C.I.Green (Canterbury), C, D.J.Halligan (Waikato), J.J.Kirwan (Auckland)
* Centres: B.J. McCahill (Auckland), N.J.Schuster (Wellington), J.T.Stanley (Auckland) 
* Half backs: S.J.Bachop (Otago), I.B.Deans (Canterbury), W.R. Smith (Canterbury) 
* Front rows: J.A.S.Buchan (Canterbury), W.G.Bunn (Taranaki), B.T.Fitzpatrick (Auckland), S.C.McDowall (Auckland), B.McGrattan (Wellington)
* Locks: B.L.Anderson (Wairapa-Bush), M.Weedon (Bay of Plenty), G.W.Whetton (Auckland) 
* Back rows: M.R.Brewer (Otago), M.N.Jones (Auckland), A.J.Whetton (Auckland), D.A.Williams (Wellington)

Subsequent NZ Barbarian trips to the UK were undertaken in 1996 and 2003.

=== 1996 tour ===
The November 1996 matches were part of the ERFU&#x27;s 125th celebrations with a warm-up fixture against the North Of England played in the snow at Huddersfield ahead of a &quot;test&quot; against England the week after.John Hart&#x27;s 24-man squad, captained by Sean Fitzpatrick featured 19 All Blacks and four future All Blacks and won both fixtures, an 86-0 win against the North of England for whom twelve first choice selections had withdrawn from the team on the preceding Wednesday and a 34-19 victory against England at Twickenham Stadium.

* Back three: J.T Lomu (Counties), C.M.Cullen (Manawatu), G.M. Osborne (North Harbour), J.Vidiri (Counties)
* Centres: N.A.Ieremia (Wellington)*, M.R.Ranby (Manawatu)F, L.Stensness (Auckland)*
* Half-backs: J.W.Marshall (Canterbury), A.P Mehrtens (Canterbury), C.J Spencer (Auckland), M.D. Robinson (North Harbour)
* Front Row: M.R. Allen (Taranaki), O.M.Brown (Auckland), M.Collins (Waikato), S.B.T. Fitzpatrick (Capt.) (Auckland)* A.D.Oliver (Otago)
* Locks: R.M. Brooke (Auckland), I.D. Jones (Auckland), G.L.Taylor (Northland)
* Back Row: A.F.Blowers (Auckland), C.S.Davis (Manawatu), M.N.Jones (Auckland), D.G.Mika (Auckland), T.C.Randell (Otago)

=== 2003 tour ===
The 2003 match played at Twickenham was viewed at the time as something of a festival affair to celebrate the home country&#x27;s recent RWC success. Falling as it did during the British, Irish and European club championships, both sides struggled to assemble &quot;full strength squads&quot; indeed the England XV featured only five RUWC cup winners.Contractual difficulties with clubs releasing players resulted in the NZ Barbarians side being deemed - in comparison to previous touring parties - as at best only &quot;competitive&quot; and the England XV side ran out very comfortable winners, 42-17.

* Back three: G.P.&quot;Jorrie&quot; Muller (Lions &amp; South Africa), R.L Gear (North Harbour), E.Taione (Newcastle Falcons &amp; Tonga), Diego Albanese (Leeds Tykes &amp; Argentina)
* Centres: D.L Gibson (Leicester &amp; NZ), K.R.Lowren (Waikato), T.A. Vili (Border Reivers &amp; Samoa)
* Half backs: D.D. Lee (Otago), G.W. Jackson (Bay of Plenty), B.Willis (Harlequins)
* Front rows: A.K.Hore (Taranaki), M.R.Hurter (Newcastle Falcons &amp; South Africa), D.T Manu (Waikato), S.A.A.&quot;Ace&quot; Tiatia (Harlequins &amp; Samoa), T.D.Woodcock (North Harbour)
* Locks: T.V.Flavell (North Harbour), T.S. Mailing (Otago), N.M.C. Maxwell (Canterbury)
* Back row: J.Blackie (Otago), S.Harding (Otago), T.C. Randell (Saracens &amp; NZ) (Capt), X.J.Rush (Auckland)

The New Zealand Barbarians were also selected for the All Blacks trial replacing the &#x27;Possibles XV&#x27; and in 2009 a New Zealand Barbarians under 85 kg Team toured Australia winning both of their games. The team played against the Māori All Blacks in 2010 at Okara Park, losing 31 – 37 before a crowd of 9,000. A Middleweight Barbarian side was also selected in 2011 to play four games. In 2015, the New Zealand Barbarians won over the Māori All Blacks 17–34.

<doc id="1264203" wikidata="Q697167" url="?curid=1264203" title="2002 German federal election">
<text>Federal elections were held in Germany on 22 September 2002 to elect the members of the 15th Bundestag. Incumbent Chancellor Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s centre-left &quot;red-green&quot; governing coalition retained a narrow majority, and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) retained their status as the largest party in the Bundestag by three seats.

==Issues and campaign==

Several issues dominated the campaign, with the opposition CDU/CSU attacking the government&#x27;s performance on the economy which fell back into recession due to the Telecoms crash and the introduction of the euro, as well as campaigning on family values and against taxes (particularly on fuel).

In the run up to the election, the CSU/CDU held a huge lead in the opinion polls and Christian Social Union (CSU) leader Edmund Stoiber famously remarked that &quot;...this election is like a football match where it&#x27;s the second half and my team is ahead by 2–0.&quot;

However, event soon overtook Stoiber and the CDU/CSU campaign. The SPD and the Greens were helped by broad support for its opposition to an invasion of Iraq, continued media attention on the CDU funding scandal and by Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s personal popularity relative to the opposition&#x27;s candidate for chancellor, Stoiber.

The SPD was also boosted by Schröder&#x27;s swift response to the August floods in eastern Germany, as compared to Stoiber, who was on vacation and responded late to the events.

With Guido Westerwelle, leader of the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the FDP presented a chancellor candidate for the first time, usually a title reserved for the main election leaders of the SPD and CDU/CSU. This was met with general derision and Westerwelle was excluded from the chancellor television debate, the first one, against which he unsuccessfully sued.

== Contesting parties ==
The table below lists parties represented in the 14th Bundestag:
==Opinion polls==
After a brief honeymoon period, the CDU/CSU overtook the SPD in opinion polling in early 1999. This dramatically reversed after the CDU donations scandal, and the SPD established a strong lead which it held throughout 2000 and 2001. The CDU/CSU retook first place at the beginning of election year, and combined with a strong FDP, the opposition held a clear lead over the SPD–Green incumbents through mid-August. Schröder&#x27;s response to the floods that month buoyed the SPD&#x27;s numbers, and put the CDU/CSU, FDP, and PDS on a downward trend. Polling during the final week of the campaign gave a narrow edge of the SPD, but also indicated the FDP would finish ahead of the Greens. Meanwhile, it was unclear if the PDS would win proportional seats, leaving the final outcome on a knife&#x27;s edge.

== Results ==
Although most opposition parties gained seats, and the result was in doubt for most of the election night, the governing coalition retained a narrow majority. In particular, the SPD was able to partially offset declines in their vote share in the West with an increase in the East, with the PDS falling below both the 5% threshold and the 3-seat threshold, either of which is required to qualify a party for top-up seats. Consequently, the PDS held only two directly elected seats.

===Results by state===
Second vote (&quot;Zweitstimme&quot;, or votes for party list)

==Post-election==
The coalition between the SPD and the Greens continued in government, with Schröder as chancellor. However, due to the slim majority in the Bundestag, the governing coalition was not stable.

<text>The International Meteor Organization (IMO) was formally founded in 1988 from predecessor gatherings over many years. IMO has several hundred members and was created in response to an ever-growing need for international cooperation on amateur and professional meteor work. The collection of meteor observations by several methods from all around the world ensures the comprehensive study of meteor showers and their relation to comets and interplanetary dust.

IMO publishes a bimonthly journal called &quot;WGN&quot; and holds an annual International Meteor Conference (IMC) in September.
