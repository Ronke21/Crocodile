<text>Sir Kenneth Adam (born Klaus Hugo George Fritz Adam; 5 February 1921 – 10 March 2016) was a German-British movie production designer, best known for his set designs for the James Bond films of the 1960s and 1970s, as well as for &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Salon Kitty&quot;.

Adam won two Academy Awards for Best Art Direction. Born in Berlin, he relocated to England with his Jewish family at the age of 13 soon after the Nazis came to power. Together with his younger brother, Denis Adam, he was one of only three German-born pilots to serve in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

==Early life==
Adam was born in 1921 in Berlin to an upper-middle-class secular Jewish family, the third child of Lilli () and Fritz Adam, a former Prussian cavalry officer who had served with the Zieten Hussars. Fritz had been awarded the Iron Cross Second Class and the Iron Cross First Class for his service in the First World War.

Fritz co-owned a well-known high-fashion clothing and sporting goods store called S. Adam (Berlin, Leipziger Straße/Friedrichstraße) together with his three brothers, George, Siegfried and Otto Adam.
The company had been established in 1863 by Saul Adam. Klaus (Ken) had two older siblings, Peter, Loni and a younger brother Dieter (1 February 1924 – 17 October 2018).

The family lived an almost idyllic, privileged existence until the Nazi Party came to power.

His older brother Peter was good friends with Gottfried Reinhardt the son of theatre and film director Max Reinhardt and they would often take the young Klaus out with them. As a result, he got to know Max Reinhardt and many other people in the German theatre. Gottfried Reinhardt later became a film director and producer.

===England===
The combination of his brother Dieter at the age of nine having a fight with a playground bully wearing a Hitler Youth uniform and the increasing discrimination against Jews convinced their parents to send Klaus and Dieter to Craigend Park boarding school in Edinburgh. Upon arrival Klaus anglicised his name to Kenneth and eventually Ken while his brother Dieter changed his to Denis. Their oldest brother Peter was at the time studying law at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France and decided to move to England and complete his studies there.

The rest of the Adam family stayed in Germany as Adam&#x27;s father felt that the Nazis were only a temporary aberration and they would wait it out. Things however continued to deteriorate with Jewish stores being boycotted and targeted for attacks in April 1933.

During the summer of 1933, Max Reich, a senior employee of the family business, and then Fritz Adam were arrested. Reich was a member of the SS and leader of the business&#x27;s Nazi cell. Reich was eventually released and Fritz Adam was released and put under house arrest for three days. Inquiries determined that a former employee who had been dismissed for dishonesty had accused the two men of unfair dismissal and conspiring to maintain undeclared funds in Switzerland. It took two weeks to disprove both allegations and no charges were laid against either man.
Reluctantly coming to the conclusion that Jews had no future in Germany, Fritz, Lilli and Loni, as well as some of Ken&#x27;s aunts and uncles, fled to England in the summer of 1934. The family eventually settled in the Hampstead area of London the following year.

The family were declared refugees on their arrival to England and identified as &quot;friendly aliens&quot; with the exception of Denis who was too young to be classified. The family arrived in England with nothing other than some gold coins Lilli had smuggled out. His mother who had never previously worked in her life used the little money they had to establish and run a boarding house. His father struggled with his change in status and starting over in a new country. His father started an import-export business selling gloves but his health deteriorated and he died in 1936 when he was 56 years old.

Adam left the boarding school in Edinburgh to rejoin his parents in London and continued his education at St. Paul&#x27;s School in London. At his mother&#x27;s boarding house Adam became increasingly interested in cinema after coming into contact with a number of artists among the Jewish refugees who were boarding there. He was introduced to Vincent Korda, a Hungarian art director, when he was working on &quot;Knight Without Armour&quot; at Denham Film Studios. Korda not only nurtured Adam&#x27;s passion for films, but encouraged him to train as an architect if he was interested in becoming a production designer. Leaving school he became an apprentice at the firm of CW Glover &amp; Partners (which specialized in making bomb shelters) and he signed up for evening classes at the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London. Among his tutors was a part-time teacher who had been an assistant of famed German architect Erich Mendelsohn from whom Adam learned valuable architectural drawing techniques.

==World War II==
When World War II began, Adam was working on designs for air-raid shelters and illustrated books on air-raid protection and gas masks. As German citizens, the Adam family could have been interned as enemy aliens, but in October 1940 Adam was able to join the Pioneer Corps, a support unit of the British Army open to citizens of Axis countries resident in the UK and other Commonwealth countries, provided they were not considered a risk to security. Adam was seconded to design bomb shelters.

After eight months service in the Pioneer Corps, Adam&#x27;s application to join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a pilot was accepted. After initial flight training on de Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes in Scotland, he was sent to Canada and the United States for additional training. Among his instructors was British actor Michael Rennie.

Flight Lieutenant Adam joined No. 609 Squadron at RAF Lympne on 1 October 1943. He was nicknamed &quot;Heinie the tank-buster&quot; by his comrades for his daring exploits. The squadron flew the Hawker Typhoon, initially in support of USAAF long-range bombing missions over Europe. Later they were employed in support of ground troops, including at the battle of the Falaise Gap, in Normandy after D-Day. In 1944, his brother Denis joined No. 183 Squadron, joining Adam in No. 123 Wing. There were four squadrons in the wing: 164, 183, 198 and 609.

Together with his brother Denis, Adam was one of three German-born pilots to serve in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, the third being Peter Stevens. As such, if they had been captured by the Germans, they were liable to execution as traitors rather than being treated as prisoners of war.

Following the end of the war Adam was the Allied officer in charge of German labour rebuilding Wunstorf Air Base. Adam naturalised as a British subject on 27 December 1946 and left the RAF upon his demobilisation in 1947.

==Film career==
Adam entered the film industry as a draughtsman on &quot;This Was a Woman&quot; (1948) at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. His first major screen credit was as production designer on the British thriller &quot;Soho Incident&quot; (1956). Working in 1952 for art director Paul Sheriff on the Burt Lancaster film &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot;, Adam designed an 18th-century hot-air balloon, a flame-throwing tank, and a rowing boat that transformed into a submarine.

In the mid-1950s, he worked (uncredited) on the epics &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (also 1956) and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), directed by William Wyler.

In 1956 he assisted art director Edward Carrere with the sets for &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;.

His first major credit was for the horror film &quot;Night of the Demon&quot; (1957), directed by Jacques Tourneur, and he was also the production designer on several films directed by Robert Aldrich.
The first public knowledge of his expertise came when he won an award for the sets of &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot; at the Moscow Film Festival in 1960.

He was hired for the first James Bond film, &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962). Adam did not work on the second James Bond film, &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963), because he was working on Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964). His work on this film was described by the British Film Institute (BFI) as &quot;gleaming and sinister&quot;. Steven Spielberg even called it &quot;the best set that&#x27;s ever been designed&quot;. He turned down the opportunity to work on Kubrick&#x27;s next project, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), after he found out that Kubrick had been working with NASA for a year on space exploration, and that it would put him at a disadvantage in developing his art.

This enabled Adam to make his name with his innovative, semi-futuristic sets for further James Bond films, such as &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965), &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967), and &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971). The supertanker set for &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) was constructed in the largest soundstage in the world at the time. Adam claims it was lit by Stanley Kubrick in secret. His last Bond film was &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979). Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2005, journalist Johnny Dee claimed: &quot;His sets for the seven Bond films he worked on [...] are as iconic as the movies themselves and set the benchmark for every blockbuster&quot;.

Adam&#x27;s other film credits include &quot;The Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot; (1960), the Michael Caine espionage thriller &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; (1965) and its sequel &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot; (1966), the Peter O&#x27;Toole version of &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969), &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1972), &quot;Salon Kitty&quot; (1976), &quot;Agnes of God&quot; (1985), &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994). He was also a visual consultant on the film version of &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; (1981), adapted from Dennis Potter&#x27;s television serial.

Adam returned to work with Kubrick on &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975), for which he won his first Oscar. The BFI noted the film&#x27;s &quot;contrastingly mellow Technicolor beauties&quot; in its depiction of the 18th century. He also designed the famous car for the film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), which was produced by the same team as the James Bond film series. During the late 1970s, he worked on storyboards and concept art for &quot;Star Trek: Planet of the Titans&quot;, then in pre-production. The film was eventually shelved by Paramount Pictures.

Adam was a jury member at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival and the 49th Berlin International Film Festival. In 1999, during the Victoria and Albert Museum exhibition &quot;Ken Adam – Designing the Cold War&quot;, Adam spoke on his role in the design of film sets associated with the 1960s through the 1980s.

==Death==
Adam died on 10 March 2016 at his home in London, following a short illness. He was 95 years old.

==Personal life==
He met his wife Maria-Letizia Moauro while filming &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot; on location on the Italian island of Ischia and they married on 16 August 1952.

==Legacy==
In September 2012, Adam handed over his entire body of work to the Deutsche Kinemathek. The Ken Adam collection comprises approximately 4,000 sketches for films from all periods, photo albums to individual films, storyboards of his employees, memorabilia, military medals, and identity documents, as well as all cinematic awards, including Adam&#x27;s two Academy Awards.

The Ken Adam Building, a large lot at Pinewood Studios&#x27;s Buckingham location, bears Adam&#x27;s name and houses multiple theatres and businesses as well as the Kodak Film Lab and an office of the trade union Bectu.

==Honours==
Adam was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1996 New Year Honours for services to the film industry and Knight Bachelor in the 2003 Birthday Honours for services to film production design and to UK–German relations. Adam was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 2009.

<text>Ronald Yeats (15 November 1937 – 6 September 2024) was a Scottish footballer.

He started his professional career with Dundee United in 1957 before joining Liverpool in 1961. He became club captain and won six trophies—two league titles, one FA Cup and three Charity Shields—over the following ten years. In 1971, he joined Tranmere Rovers, where he spent three years as player-manager before serving in the same role at Barrow and Santa Barbara Condors.

He also won two caps for the Scotland national team.

==Career==
Yeats was an Under-15 schoolboy international who played for Aberdeen Lads&#x27; Club, a Junior club in his home city of Aberdeen. In 1956, following a leg break, Yeats had a trial with Elgin City, then a Highland League club, but was not offered a contract. 

===Dundee United===
In 1957 he was signed by Dundee United, then a part-time club of Scottish Division Two. Previous to signing for the club, he worked in a slaughterhouse in Aberdeen. 

Yeats&#x27;s career took an upward turn following Jerry Kerr&#x27;s appointment: Kerr regarded Yeats as so vital to the fortunes of the team he sought his release to play each Saturday from the military authorities while Yeats served his National Service. In 1959–60, Kerr&#x27;s first full season in charge, St Johnstone finished as Division Two champions. United&#x27;s challengers for the second promotion spot were Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South. Hamilton were beaten 5–1 at Tannadice with seven games to go before a crowd of over 11,000, putting Hamilton firmly in United&#x27;s rear view. United went to Palmerston Park to play the Ivor Broadis inspired Queen of the South with three games to go. United returned home with a 4–4 draw to maintain their one-point advantage over QoS. Promotion was clinched with a last game of the season 1–0 home win against Berwick Rangers before a crowd of near 17,000. This brought top division football back to Tannadice Park for the first time since they had been relegated in 1932.

In the following 1960–61 season, United retained their top division place, finishing in ninth. Other players to flourish like Yeats were the forward pair Dennis Gillespie and Jim Irvine. Yeats played 118 matches (95 in the league) for Dundee United. 

===Liverpool===
Yeats, a stockily built 6 ft 2 in central defender, was bought by manager Bill Shankly in 1961 from United for a fee of around £20,000 and was immediately installed as captain. When Yeats was signed, Shankly was so impressed with the physical presence of his new player that he told waiting journalists &quot;The man is a mountain, go into the dressing room and walk around him&quot;. Shankly later described Yeats&#x27;s arrival, along with that of striker Ian St John also in the 1961 close season, as the &quot;turning point&quot; as Liverpool began their quest to compete with — and beat — the best in England and in Europe. Yeats made his debut in a 2–0 league victory over Bristol Rovers at Eastville on 19 August 1961. After Yeats&#x27;s first season, Liverpool gained promotion from the Second Division with a runaway eight-point margin over their nearest rivals (two points for a win) after eight seasons away from English football&#x27;s top flight. His first goal came on 23 November 1963 in the 75th minute of the 1–0 First Division victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Yeats lived up to the reputation and the nickname (&quot;The Colossus&quot;) his huge frame gave him, playing at the heart of Liverpool&#x27;s defence for a decade and winning the club&#x27;s first major honours in nearly 20 years.

Liverpool were the 1963–64 Football League champions. The next season, they won the 1964–65 FA Cup beating Leeds United 2–1 after extra time in the final at Wembley Stadium. This was the club&#x27;s first ever FA Cup trophy. However Liverpool lost in the European Cup semi-final to Inter Milan that season. The next season Yeats skippered Liverpool to the 1965–66 Football League title. In Europe Liverpool reached the 1966 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final at Hampden Park in Yeats native Scotland. However Liverpool lost out after extra time to Borussia Dortmund.

In the 1966–67 European Cup second round, Yeats and co were given a torrid time by a Johan Cruyff inspired Ajax, who won 5–1 in Amsterdam and 7–3 on aggregate. The success of Liverpool then dried up, and he was one of the high-profile victims of a massive cull of the older players which Shankly ruthlessly undertook in 1970 in an effort to rebuild the side for a new decade. After 454 games, Yeats left in 1971. He had played a record 417 games as captain for Liverpool, which was later surpassed by Steven Gerrard.

Yeats won both his full caps for Scotland during the three seasons when the Liverpool team of the 1960s were at their peak. The first came on 3 October 1964 in a 3–2 defeat to Wales at Ninian Park, Cardiff. His second was a year later in December 1965 in a World Cup qualification decider away to Italy. The Scots had beaten the Italians 1–0 at Hampden Park. However Jock Stein&#x27;s side missing the absent Denis Law went out when losing 3–0 in Naples.

===Later years and retirement===
Yeats served Tranmere Rovers for three years as player-manager.

Yeats had a short spell playing for Stalybridge Celtic. He then served Barrow as player manager. 

In 1976 at age 38, Yeats joined the Los Angeles Skyhawks of the American Soccer League at the request of Skyhawk coach Ron Newman. In his only season there, he played sweeper and anchored the defence of the A.S.L. champion Skyhawks. In 1977, Yeats became the player coach of the American Soccer League&#x27;s Santa Barbara Condors expansion team. 

Returning to Liverpool, he had a short spell at the start of the 1977–78 season playing for Formby before moving to Rhyl in November 1977. In 1986 Yeats returned to Anfield as the club&#x27;s chief scout responsible for delegating duties to the club&#x27;s talent spotters. He remained in that role until his retirement in May 2006. 

==Death==
In January 2024, it was announced that Yeats was living with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He died from complications of the disease on 6 September 2024, at the age of 86.

==Legacy==
Yeats was voted 29th in the official Liverpool website poll &quot;100 Players Who Shook The Kop&quot;. 

In April 2009, Yeats was made an &quot;Honorary Scouser&quot; by the Lord Mayor of Liverpool.

He is referenced in the Everton song &quot;Royal Blue Mersey&quot; in the line &quot;We hate Bill Shankly, and we hate St. John, but most of all we hate Big Ron.&quot;

<doc id="1231102" wikidata="Q337000" url="?curid=1231102" title="Alexander Henderson (theologian)">
<text>Alexander Henderson (19 August 1646) was a Scottish theologian, and an important ecclesiastical statesman of his period. He is considered the second founder of the Reformed Church in Scotland. He was one of the most eminent ministers of the Church of Scotland in the most important period of her history, namely, previous to the middle of the seventeenth century.

Alexander Henderson was born in 1583, and studied at the University of St. Andrews. He was, through the influence of Archbishop Gladstanes, presented to the church living of Leuchars, Fifeshire, and was in 1615 inducted forcibly into the charge. He was then a supporter of episcopacy; he subsequently changed his views and became a zealous upholder of Presbyterianism. He opposed the adoption of the Five Articles of Perth in 1618, and resisted the use of the Scottish Prayer Book in 1637.

He drafted both the National Covenant of 1638 with Archibald Johnston, Lord Warriston, and the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. He preached in the Greyfriars church on 28 February 1638, when the National Covenant was signed, and presided as Moderator of the memorable General Assembly held at Glasgow in the following November. On two subsequent occasions he was chosen Moderator of Assembly. He was Rector of Edinburgh University, and instituted a Professorship of Oriental Languages in that seat of learning. With a view to conciliate the Presbyterians, Charles I appointed him his chaplain on his visit to Scotland in 1641.

Henderson was entrusted with various important missions; he was one of the commissioners who represented the Scottish Church at the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, and he was honoured with several interviews by Charles I when he endeavoured, though unsuccessfully, to bring the king over to Presbyterianism. He died at Edinburgh on 19 August 1646. At the Restoration the inscriptions on his tombstone were obliterated; they were restored at the Glorious Revolution.

==Early life==

Alexander Henderson was born at Guthrie, in the Fife parish of Creich, in 1583. Of his parentage and family history hardly anything is known. Tradition, following from Wodrow, says he was the son of a feuar, and a cadet of the Hendersons of Fordel. In support of the latter statement, his remains lie in the burying-ground of that family in Greyfriars Churchyard, and a contemporary portrait of him is still in possession of a representative of that house. His birthplace was between the villages of Luthrie and Branton. To the maintenance of a school at Luthrie he left two thousand marks Scots in his will. On 19 December 1599, at the age of sixteen, he matriculated at St Salvator&#x27;s College, St Andrews, and took his degree of M.A. in 1603. From 1603 to 1611 he was a Regent of Philosophy, and during that period he completed his course in divinity.

==Early career==
He adopted strong prelatic principles, and was a staunch upholder of Archbishop Gledstanes, who afterwards became his patron, and presented him to the parish of Leuchars. His settlement was so unpopular that on the day of his ordination, probably in January 1614, the church doors were found securely nailed up, and he and his friends were obliged to enter by the window. Mr. Henderson at first showed but little concern for the spiritual interests of his people; but his sentiments and character soon underwent a complete change. 

A Communion sermon preached in a neighbouring parish by Robert Bruce of Kinnaird, was the means of changing Henderson&#x27;s spiritual outlook. Attracted by the fame of the preacher, he slipped (so goes the story) into the darkest corner of the church, hoping to steal out again unrecognised. Bruce chose for his text the words: &quot;He that entereth not by the door,&quot; etc. This passage, so applicable to his situation, and the sermon which followed, made such an impression on his mind as led to an entire change in his views and conduct. Bruce, nevertheless, seems to have been aware of his presence; or, if not, there was a singular coincidence in the applicability of the text which he chose, to the remarkable circumstances which attended Henderson&#x27;s induction to his charge. 

Robert Bruce&#x27;s sermon made such a powerful impression upon him that it effected an entire change in his religious conduct and sentiments; and from being a careless and indifferent pastor over his flock, and an upholder of a system odious in the highest degree to the people, he became a watchful and earnest minister, and a resolute champion in the cause of Presbyterianism. He now became thoroughly convinced that the proceedings of the prelatical party were injurious to the interests of religion, and he resolved at once to take part with the Presbyterians. His first appearance in that connection was at the Perth Assembly of 1618, when he strenuously opposed the Five Articles, notwithstanding the threats of the Government.

Henderson stood among the foremost of those who opposed, though unsuccessfully, the obnoxious measure; and this too, in defiance of the king&#x27;s utmost wrath, with which all who resisted the adoption of the Five articles were threatened. &quot;In case of your refusal,&quot; said the archbishop of St Andrews, addressing the assembled clergymen, &quot;the whole order and estate of your church will be overthrown, some ministers will be banished, others will be deprived of their stipends and office, and all will be brought under the wrath of authority.&quot; 

In August 1619 he appeared before the Court of High Commission charged with the publication of a pamphlet denouncing the Perth Assembly. On their appearance, Mr. Henderson answered the accusation with so much eloquence and truth, that the bishops could gain no advantage over him and his friends, and were obliged to dismiss them with threatenings, and Henderson returned to his parish. Of the next eighteen years we know little or nothing.

==The National Covenant - Contending against Episcopacy==

With the memorable year 1637 Henderson reappears on the scene, a keen opponent of the Scottish Prayer Book, also known as &quot;Laud&#x27;s Liturgy,&quot; which King Charles was determined to foist on the Church.

In common with other ministers, he had been charged to purchase two copies of the liturgy for the use of his parish within fifteen days, under the pain of rebellion. He immediately went to Edinburgh, and, 23 August, presented a petition to the privy council, representing that the service book had not received the sanction of the General Assembly, nor was recognised by an act of parliament, and praying a suspension of the charge. To this remonstrance the council returned a favourable answer, and the reading of the liturgy was ordered to be suspended until the king&#x27;s farther pleasure should be known.

Charles, however, only the more peremptorily insisted that the service book should be received; and from this time forward Mr. Henderson took a prominent share in all the proceedings of the nonconformists. A great number of the nobility, gentry, clergymen, and representatives of burghs, with others, had assembled in Edinburgh from all parts of the country; and after another supplication had been presented to the privy council, praying them to bring the matter again before the king, a proclamation from his majesty was made, requiring all persons to depart to their homes within twenty-four hours, on pain of being denounced rebels. Instead of dispersing, the leaders of the popular party, after some farther ineffectual petitions to the king, resolved to appeal to the people, and the result was the renewal of the National Covenant of 1580 and 1581, with only some slight changes adapted to the circumstances of the times. It was prepared by Mr. Henderson, assisted by Lord Warrison, Archibald Johnston, an advocate in whom, we are told, the suppliants chiefly confided, and was sworn and subscribed in the Greyfriars&#x27; church of Edinburgh, on 28 February 1638, by thousands of the nobility, gentry, ministers of the gospel, burgesses, and others. Mr. Henderson addressed the vast multitude assembled with great fervour and eloquence, aud the enthusiasm of the people knew no bounds. He was subsequently sent with several noblemen, and Messrs. Cant and Dickson, to Aberdeen, to prevail on the inhabitants of that city to take the Covenant, and, after urging upon them the strongest arguments in favour of the document, no less than 500 persons subscribed it, many of them being of the highest respectability. 

Mainly through Henderson&#x27;s influence the National League and Covenant was signed, 21 February 1638, and he was Moderator of the Assembly which met at Glasgow, 21 November of the same year.

On 1 March 1638 the public signing of the National Covenant began in Greyfriars Kirk, Edinburgh. Henderson was mainly responsible for the final form of this document, which consisted of:

# a recital of the acts of parliament against superstitious and papistical rites
# an elaborate oath to maintain the true reformed religion.

Owing to the skill shown on this occasion he seems to have been applied to when any manifesto of unusual ability was required. In July of the same year he proceeded to the north to debate on the Covenant with the famous Aberdeen doctors but he was not well received. Robert Baillie wrote: &quot;The Voyd church was made fast, and the keys kept by the magistrate&quot;.

Henderson&#x27;s next public opportunity was in the famous Assembly which met in Glasgow on 21 November 1638. He was chosen moderator by acclamation, being, as Baillie says, incomparable the ablest man of us all for all things. James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, was the king&#x27;s commissioner; and when the Assembly insisted on proceeding with the trial of the bishops, he formally dissolved the meeting under pain of treason. Acting on the constitutional principle that the king&#x27;s right to convene did not interfere with the church&#x27;s independent right to hold assemblies, they sat till 20 December, deposed all the Scottish bishops, excommunicated a number of them, repealed all acts favouring episcopacy, and reconstituted the Scottish Kirk on thorough Presbyterian principles. During the sitting of this Assembly it was carried by a majority of seventy-five votes that Henderson should be transferred to Edinburgh. He had been at Leuchars for about twenty-three years and was extremely reluctant to leave it.
While Scotland and England were preparing for the First Bishops&#x27; War, Henderson drew up two papers, entitled respectively &quot;The Remonstrance of the Nobility&quot; and &quot;Instructions for Defensive Arms&quot;. The first of these documents he published himself; the second was published against his wish by John Corbet, a deposed minister. The text was written in haste in 1639 and is reported to have been lifted from a work by Johannes Althusius to provide justification for bearing arms.

The First Bishops&#x27; War did not last long. At the Pacification of Birks the king virtually granted all the demands of the Scots. In the negotiations for peace Henderson was one of the Scottish commissioners, and made a very favourable impression on the king.
At the memorable General Assembly which met at Glasgow the same year, 21 November 1638, the first that had been held for a long period, Mr. Henderson, now the acknowledged leader of the clergy, was unanimously chosen moderator. And in that difficult and trying situation, he conducted himself with a resolution and prudence, and at the same time with a forbearance and moderation, befitting the occasion. After the deposition and excommunication of the bishops, and the formal abolition of Episcopacy, Mr. Henderson terminated the proceedings with an eloquent and impressive address to the members of the Assembly, concluding with these striking words: — &quot;We have now cast down the walls of Jericho; let him that re-buildeth them beware of the curse of Hiel the Bethelite!&quot;

Before the rising of the Assembly two supplications were given in, the one containing a call to Mr. Henderson from St. Andrews, and the other from Edinburgh. Being much attached to his own parish of Leuchars, of which he had been minister for eighteen years, he expressed his unwillingness to remove from it, pleading that he was now too old a plant to take root in another soil. It was carried, however, by seventy-five votes, that he should be translated to Edinburgh; to which he consented, on condition that when old age should overtake him, he should again be removed to a country charge.
==Dealings with the king==

He received calls to St Andrews, and Greyfriars, Edinburgh, and was translated to St. Giles, Edinburgh on 10 January 1639, replacing James Hannay. He was appointed a Commissioner for framing a treaty of peace with England.

In 1639 he was one of the commissioners appointed by the Church to treat regarding the articles of pacification with the king; and during the whole of the difficult negotiations that ensued, he behaved with great prudence and candour. At the subsequent meeting of the Assembly, in August of that year, John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Traquair, commissioner from his majesty, earnestly desired that Mr. Henderson might be re-elected moderator, a proposition strenuously opposed by Mr. Henderson himself, and rejected by the Assembly, a constant moderatorship being contrary to the constitution of the Church. On the 31st of the same month, he was called upon to preach at the opening of parliament, on which occasion he delivered an excellent discourse, in which he treated, with consummate ability, of the end, duties, and utility of magistrates. He was again Moderator in 1639.

The king having refused to ratify some of the points agreed upon at the late pacification, suddenly prorogued the parliament, denounced the Covenanters as rebels, and prepared again to invade Scotland. But the successes of the Scots army, which entered England in August 1640, compelled him to accede to another proposition for peace; and a conference was begun at Rippon, which, in a short time after, was transferred to London. Mr. Henderson was appointed one of the commissioners, on the part of the Church, to conclude the treaty, and during all the time of his residence in London, which was protracted for nine months, he exerted himself, by preaching and otherwise, to promote the views of the commissioners; and wrote a variety of able tracts and papers, some of which were published without his name, while others were laid before the commissioners and parliament of England. Before he left London he was admitted to a private conference with the king, the special object of which was to procure assistance to the Scottish universities from the rents formerly appropriated to the bishops, when he was graciously received by his majesty.

==University appointment==
In January 1640 he was Rector of the University of Edinburgh, and held office for the rest of his life. In 1640 the town council of Edinburgh, with the view of rendering the system of education at the university more efficient, resolved to appoint annually a rector of that institution, and unanimously elected Mr. Henderson to the situation. He was empowered to superintend all matters connected with the conduct of the principal and professors, the education of the students, and the disposal of the revenues. In this office, which he appears to have enjoyed, by re-election, to his death, he exerted himself sedulously to promote the interests of that learned seminary. Besides devoting his especial attention to the education of candidates for the ministry, he instituted a professorship of oriental languages, a department previously much neglected. 

In 1640 Henderson was elected by the town council rector of Edinburgh University, an office to which he was annually re-elected till his death. The Pacification of Birks had been wrung from the king and the Scots, seeing that he was preparing for the Second Bishops&#x27; War, took the initiative and pressed into England so vigorously that Charles had again to yield. The maturing of the treaty of peace took a considerable time and Henderson was again active in the negotiations, first at Ripon (1 October) and afterwards in London. While he was in London he had a personal interview with the king with the view of obtaining assistance for the Scottish universities from money formerly applied to the support of the bishops.

==Moderatorial activities==
On Henderson&#x27;s return to Edinburgh in July 1641, the Assembly was sitting at St Andrews. To suit the convenience of the parliament, however, it removed to Edinburgh. On his return to Edinburgh, in July 1641, he was again chosen moderator of the General Assembly. In this Assembly he proposed that a confession of faith, a catechism, a directory for all the parts of the public worship, and a platform of government wherein possibly England and we might agree, should be drawn up. This was unanimously approved and the laborious undertaking was left in Henderson&#x27;s hands but the notable motion did not lead to any immediate results.

During Charles&#x27;s second state visit to Scotland in the autumn of 1641, Henderson acted as his chaplain and managed to get the funds, formerly belonging to the bishopric of Edinburgh, applied to the metropolitan university. The following year Henderson, whose policy was to keep Scotland neutral in the war which had now broken out between the king and the parliament, was engaged in corresponding with England on ecclesiastical topics; and shortly afterwards he was sent to Oxford to mediate between the king and his parliament but his mission proved a failure.

Having delivered in a letter from a number of ministers in London, requesting advice as to the proper form of church government to be adopted, several of their brethren being inclined towards Independency, the Assembly instructed him to answer it; and in his reply he earnestly urged a uniformity of church government in the two kingdoms. The Assembly unanimously approved of a motion which he brought forward, to the effect that they should take steps for drawing up a Confession of Faith, Catechism, Directory of Worship, and Form of Government; and remitted to him to prepare the necessary drafts of these documents. On 14 August, the king arrived at Edinburgh to be present at the parliament; on which occasion, wishing to conciliate the presbyterian party, he appointed Mr. Henderson his chaplain. During his majesty&#x27;s residence in Edinburgh, he performed family worship every morning and evening at the palace, and frequently preached before him in the chapel-royal at Holyroodhouse. At this parliament the revenues of the bishoprics were divided; and by Mr.
Henderson&#x27;s exertions, what belonged to the bishopric and priory of Edinburgh were bestowed on the university. As a recompence for his own laborious and expensive services in the cause of the public, the emoluments of the chapel-royal, amounting to about 4,000 merks a-year, were conferred upon him.

Some reports injurious to his character having been industriously circulated, in the ensuing Assembly he entered into a long and impassioned vindication of his conduct. His brethren unanimously expressed their sympathy, and assured him of their continued confidence; on which we are told he recovered his cheerfulness.

In 1641, he preached before King Charles at Holyrood, and was made Dean of the Chapel Royal. A third time he was Moderator, 2 August 1643, and was elected a member of the Westminster Assembly of Divines. He declined the principalship of St Mary&#x27;s College, St Andrews, and died unmarried 19 August 1646. Next to the Church, Henderson&#x27;s greatest service was devoted to the University of Edinburgh. &quot;He was the ablest educationist and the man of clearest insight of all who had to do with the college since its foundation. He saw what was wanted, and had the energy and the tact necessary for securing it. It would have been an inestimable advantage for the universities of Scotland if his life could have been prolonged for twenty years &quot; (Grant&#x27;s Univ. of Edinburgh, i., 209).

==Civil War==
During the year 1642, the time of the English Civil War, Henderson was employed in managing the correspondence with England respecting ecclesiastical reformation and union. He was soon after chosen one of the commissioners appointed to proceed to that country, but was for some time delayed by the civil war. Anxious to effect a reconciliation between Charles and his English subjects, he joined with some other leading men in an invitation to the queen to come to Scotland; but this proposition was rejected by the king.

Accompanied by the other commissioners, he next went to Oxford, where his majesty then was, to offer him the mediation of Scotland; but the infatuated monarch, instead of making some concessions for the sake of peace, endeavoured to convince him of the justice of his cause, defended all his proceedings, and expressed his high indignation at the interest which the Scots took in the reformation of the church in England. On Henderson&#x27;s return to Edinburgh, his conduct throughout this delicate negotiation was pronounced by the General Assembly to have been &quot;faithful and wise.&quot;

==Westminster Assembly==
In 1643 he was, for the third time, chosen moderator of the General Assembly — an occasion which was rendered remarkable by the presence of the English commissioners sent down by the parliament to crave their aid and connsel in the then critical circumstances of both kingdoms. He was appointed one of the commissioners who soon after went to London to attend the Assembly of divines at Westminster, to represent there the Church of Scotland, and to obtain the ratification of the Solemn League and Covenant by that Assembly and by both houses of parliament; which was accordingly done on 25 September.
During the three following years he remained in London, unremittingly engaged in assisting the Westminster Assembly in preparing the public formularies for the religious union between the three kingdoms.

A memorable meeting of the General Assembly was held in August 1643. Henderson was elected moderator for the third time. He presented a draft of the famous Solemn League and Covenant, which was received with great enthusiasm. Unlike the National Covenant of 1638, which applied to Scotland only, this document was common to the two kingdoms. Henderson, Baillie, Rutherford and others were sent up to London to represent Scotland in the Assembly at Westminster. The Solemn League and Covenant, which pledged both countries to the extirpation of prelacy, leaving further decision as to church government to be decided by the example of the best reformed churches, after undergoing some slight alterations passed both parliaments, the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England, and thus became law for the two kingdoms. By means of it Henderson has had considerable influence on the history of Great Britain.

As Scottish commissioner to the Westminster Assembly he was in England from August 1643 till August 1646 and his principal work was the drafting of the Directory for Public Worship.

==Last days==

Early in 1645 Henderson was sent to the Treaty of Uxbridge to aid the commissioners of the two parliaments in negotiating with the king but nothing came of the conference. In 1646 the king joined the Scottish Army; and, after retiring with them to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, he sent for Henderson, and discussed with him the two systems of church government in a number of papers. Meanwhile, Henderson was failing in health. He sailed to Scotland, and eight days after his arrival died, on 19 August 1646. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh; the grave lies in the southwest section near the Adam mausoleum. His death was an occasion of national mourning in Scotland.

On 7 August Baillie had written that he had heard that Henderson was dying of heartbreak. A document was published in London purporting to be a declaration of Mr Alexander Henderson made upon his death-bed and, although this paper was disowned, denounced and shown to be false in the General Assembly of August 1648, the document was used by Clarendon as giving the impression that Henderson had recanted. Its foundation was probably certain expressions lamenting Scottish interference in English affairs.

The failure of this last enterprise was fatal to Henderson&#x27;s already broken health. In June 1645 he had suffered from gravel, and tried the Epsom waters; he now showed symptoms of decline. Baillie, on 7 August, wrote that he heard he was &#x27;dying most of heartbreak.&#x27; He sailed from Newcastle to Leith, and got home to Edinburgh. Here he dined with Sir James Stewart, and was extremely cheerful and hearty, but said, &#x27;there was never a schoolboy more desirous to have the play than I am to have leave of this world.&#x27; He made his will on 17 August, and died on 19 August 1646.

In the beginning of 1645 he was appointed to assist the commissioners of the parliaments of England and Scotland in conducting the treaty between them and the king at Uxbridge. On the breaking off of the treaty he returned to London. In the spring of 1646, when the king had thrown himself into the hands of the Scottish army, he sent for Mr. Henderson, who was considered the most competent person to deal with his majesty in his then circumstances. He arrived at Newcastle about the middle of May, and received a welcome reception from the king, but soon perceived that Charles was as unwilling as ever to consent to the establishment of presbyterianism. It was agreed that the scruples which the king entertained should be discussed in a series of papers between his majesty and Mr. Henderson. These continued from 29 May to 15 July. They are eight in number, five by the king, who was assisted by Sir Robert Murray, and three by his reverend opponent. Mr. Henderson&#x27;s health being much impaired, he was obliged to remove by sea to Edinburgh, where he died, 19 August 1646, in the
63d year of his age. His body was interred in the Greyfriars churchyard, where a monument was erected by his nephew to his memory.

<doc id="1231109" wikidata="Q2275909" url="?curid=1231109" title="Hellzapoppin (musical)">
<text>Hellzapoppin is a musical revue written by the comedy team of Olsen and Johnson, consisting of John &quot;Ole&quot; Olsen and Harold &quot;Chic&quot; Johnson, with music and lyrics by Sammy Fain and Charles Tobias. The revue was a hit, running for over three years, and was at the time the longest-running Broadway musical, with 1,404 performances, making it one of only three plays to run more than 500 performances in the 1930s.

==Production==
In 1938, after opening at the Shubert Theatre in Boston on September 10, &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; opened on Broadway at the original 46th Street Theatre on September 22. It was then transferred to the Winter Garden Theatre on November 26, and finally moved to the Majestic Theatre on November 25, 1941. It closed on December 17, 1941, after a total of 1,404 performances.

Olsen &amp; Johnson led a large cast of entertainers: the comedy team of Barto and Mann (Dewey Barto and George Mann); Charles Whithers; celebrity impersonators, the Radio Rogues; Hal Sherman; Walter Nilsson; singing group The Charioteers; identical-twin dancers Betty Mae and Beverly Crane; stage magician Theo Hardeen (better known as Harry Houdini&#x27;s younger brother); the Hawaiian music of Ray Kinney and the Aloha Maids; Bergh and Moore; J. C. Olsen; Reed, Dean and Reed (Bonnie Reed, Syd Dean, and Mel Reed); Roberta and Ray; The Starlings; Dorothy Thomas; Shirley Wayne; Cyrel Roodney and June Winters; Billy Adams; and Whitey&#x27;s Steppers (also known as Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers). Olsen &amp; Johnson were succeeded by Jay C. Flippen and Happy Felton in June 1940.

===On the road===
In late 1940 and during 1941, while &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; was still playing at the Winter Garden Theatre and later the Majestic Theatre, a second edition of &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; with Billy House and Eddie Garr toured the country. The cast included Grace &amp; Nokko, The Oxford Boys, Sterner Sisters, Ben Dova, Paul Gordon, Billy Potter and Bobby Jarvis.

Following the close of &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; at the Majestic Theatre on December 18, 1941, many in the Broadway cast went on the road during 1942 with Jay C. Flippen and Happy Felton. This road edition of &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; included Barto and Mann, Charles Withers, the Radio Rogues, Harry Reso, Walter Nilsson, The Charioteers, Lyda Sue, Theo Hardeen, June Winters, Bonnie Reed, Shirley Wayne, Ruth Faber, Stephanie Olsen, Bergh and Moore, Dippy Diers, Bobby Barry, Billy Adams, and Sid Dean. The road shows continued in the same style of sight gags, risqué humor, and audience involvement.

In late 1942, a &quot;New 1943 Hellzapoppin&quot; revue with Jackie Gleason and Lew Parker was staged at the Nixon Theatre, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the Hanna Theatre, Cleveland, Ohio; and the Erlanger Theatre, Chicago, Illinois. The cast included many of the original and road show performers (Barto and Mann, the Radio Rogues, Charles Withers, Theo Hardeen, Harry Reso, Stephen Olsen, Bergh and Moore, Dippy Diers and Billy Adams) and several newcomers to the show (the Biltmorettes, the Commandos, the Kim Loo Sisters, Mary McNamee, and Jean Baker).

In 1949, Olsen &amp; Johnson went back on the road with &quot;Hellzapoppin of 1949&quot;. The all new cast featured family members J. C. Olsen (Ole&#x27;s son), June Johnson (Chic&#x27;s daughter), and Marty May (Chic&#x27;s son-in-law), along with vaudevillians Harrison &amp; Fisher; Shirley, Sharon &amp; Wanda; Nirska; Jose Duval; Gloria LeRoy; Frank Cook; The 6 Mighty Atoms; Shannon Dean; Helen Magna; Andy Ratouscheff; Hank Whitehouse; John Howes; Billy Kay; Maurice Millard; and Frank Hardy.

==Sketches==
A comedy hodgepodge full of sight gags and slapstick, the show was constantly improvised every night throughout its run to remain topical; it opened with newsreel clips of Adolf Hitler speaking in a Yiddish accent, Benito Mussolini speaking in blackface minstrel dialect, and Franklin D. Roosevelt speaking gibberish, before the real-life Olsen &amp; Johnson burst through the image (actually, a transparent sheet in front of the screen). A circus atmosphere prevailed, with dwarfs, clowns, trained pigeons and audience participation adding to the merriment. Chorus girls left the stage to dance with audience members or sit in their laps. Laundry-filled clotheslines were strung across the theater over the audiences&#x27; heads, and some seats were wired with electric buzzers that were triggered during the performance.

The sketches were a &quot;smorgasbord of explode-the-fourth-wall nuttiness:... comedy songs; skits abandoned partway through; cameos by audience stooges; an absurdist raffle; and in a trademark stunt, a man who wandered through the theater hawking an ever-larger potted tree&quot;. The comedy continued even after the show had ended, as departing audience members discovered the man who&#x27;d been carrying the increasingly tall plant waiting for them in the lobby, trapped and shouting atop a 20-foot tree.

Seeing a painting of a warship, Olsen &amp; Johnson began firing weapons at it until it sank inside the frame. At this point, a soaking wet man in a uniform walked onstage, but was shot to death by the pair because &quot;a captain always goes down with his ship!&quot; As a matron (usually Chic&#x27;s wife Catherine) walked the aisles yelling, &quot;Oscar!&quot;, another loudly said that she was just going to use the bathroom. When this started to overwhelm, an actor started loudly selling tickets to the competing Broadway show &quot;I Married an Angel&quot;.

One gag had a man and his wife arguing continually in a box seat overlooking the stage. After a particularly violent round of insults, they wrestled to the floor and he would pop up and throw his wife(a mannequin) into the downstairs aisle.

Another joke--early in the show an &quot;escape artist&quot; would be locked into a strait-jacket and promise to escape in seconds. The man, still in the strait-jacket, would appear at odd moments in the show and when the show was over he&#x27;d be rolling around the floor in the lobby, still in the strait-jacket.

Theater owners weren&#x27;t entirely happy with the show, because at least two dozen prime seats had to be reserved for audience &quot;plants and stooges&quot;, rather than being sold for money.

===Revivals===
A production of &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; toured Australia in 1949-50 playing in Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, and Sydney. The Australian shows were produced by J. C. Williamson, and featured a predominantly American cast including Don de Leo and George Mayo (as &#x27;Olsen and Johnson&#x27;), Gloria Gilbert, Tom Toby, Marlene Lilyponds, Dorothy Jean, Snowball Whittier, Charlie Pope, trombonist Reg Thorpe, and David Hogarth. Various &#x27;locals&#x27; joined the cast in some cities: Bob Dyer in Perth, and Roy Rene in Sydney. A production also played in Sydney in 1954, including female impersonator Maurice Millard.

In 1954, &quot;Hellzapoppin of 1954&quot; played The Palladium in Sydney, Australia. In addition to Olsen &amp; Johnson, this international production featured Marty May (Chic&#x27;s son-in-law), singer Joan Elms, Hawaiian dancer Dell-Fin Thursday, juggler Lloyd Nairn, and banjoist and comedian Ken Card. Reviews were mixed, with The Sydney Morning Herald stating, &quot;Noise was the predominant theme of Olsen and Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27; of 1954,&quot; which opened at the Palladium on Saturday night. Desperate efforts were made, by means of fantastic tricks and freakish capers, to whip up some sort of comic frenzy. For all that, the show lacked enough touches of verve, sparkle, and spontaneity to put it into the top vaudeville class.&quot;

Theatrical producer Alexander H. Cohen had long remembered &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;: &quot;I was an 18-year-old stagestruck college student when &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; opened, and I studied it like a textbook. I saw it 19 times during its run on Broadway.&quot; It was Cohen&#x27;s fond hope to produce &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; himself, and he purchased the rights &quot;from the estate of Olsen and Johnson&quot; in 1966. Within the year Cohen mounted a revival at Expo 67, the World&#x27;s Fair at Montreal, featuring comedians Soupy Sales and Will B. Able (Willard Achorn), but it ran only a few performances. Cohen&#x27;s plans for a Broadway opening were tabled in favor of a network-television special. A one-hour &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; starring Jack Cassidy, Ronnie Schell, and Lynn Redgrave was aired by ABC-TV in 1972.

Cohen renewed his Broadway plans in 1976, as quoted by syndicated columnist Jack O&#x27;Brian: &quot;I do think that to succeed today, a comedy revue requires a larger-than-life comic. That is why I have engaged Jerry Lewis to star in the new production of &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;, which I&#x27;m preparing for the coming season.&quot; Cohen had been impressed by Lynn Redgrave in the TV revival, and signed her to appear opposite Lewis. The Broadway debut was scheduled for Sunday night, February 13, 1977. NBC-TV had committed $1,000,000 to Cohen for broadcasting the show&#x27;s first act on national television. This was to be a TV first: live coverage of a Broadway opening night.

Out-of-town tryouts were staged in Washington, DC, Baltimore, and Boston to excellent business but mixed reviews. Things were just as chaotic backstage, as comedy star Lewis dominated the production and had serious arguments with producer Cohen, co-star Redgrave, and writer-adaptor Abe Burrows. &quot;Lewis and Miss Redgrave had been having a much publicized feud,&quot; according to an account in the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot;. &quot;He would neither rehearse nor perform any songs with her, reports said.&quot; The frantic activity extended to several sudden cast changes during the Boston run, including dancer Tommy Tune being called in on Saturday, January 15 to debut in a specialty act on the following Monday. The next day (Tuesday, January 18), NBC executives flew to Boston to see the show, and were so upset by what they saw that they expressed grave concerns to Cohen. The following day, Cohen abruptly closed the show and canceled both the Broadway engagement and the TV spectacular, forfeiting the million-dollar payment from NBC. &quot;It&#x27;s not ready for Broadway and cannot be made so in three remaining weeks before the opening,&quot; Cohen said. Cohen&#x27;s spokesman subsequently announced that the stars would be replaced: &quot;Recasting means recasting, and that&#x27;s it.&quot; As reported by columnist Dan Lewis, &quot;Those close to the producer expressed doubt that he would recast or revive the project -- that it was indeed a dead issue.&quot; NBC replaced the scheduled &quot;Hellzapoppin&quot; opening with the 1968 movie hit &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

===Film===

Olsen &amp; Johnson starred in the screen adaptation of &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot;, produced by Universal Pictures in 1941. Although the Broadway cast was initially slated to appear in the film, no one from any of the stage productions appeared in the film except Olsen &amp; Johnson, Catherine Johnson, and the dance ensemble Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers.

&quot;Hellzapoppin&quot;&#x27; was reissued to theaters in 1948 (by Realart Pictures) and released to local television stations in 1956. Universal withdrew the film in 1968 after Alexander H. Cohen bought the rights to the Olsen &amp; Johnson show.

<text>Neutrality of money is the idea that a change in the stock of money affects only nominal variables in the economy such as prices, wages, and exchange rates, with no effect on real variables, like employment, real GDP, and real consumption. Neutrality of money is an important idea in classical economics and is related to the classical dichotomy. It implies that the central bank does not affect the real economy (e.g., the number of jobs, the size of real GDP, the amount of real investment) by creating money. Instead, any increase in the supply of money would be offset by a proportional rise in prices and wages. This assumption underlies some mainstream macroeconomic models (e.g., real business cycle models). Others like monetarism view money as being neutral only in the long run.

When neutrality of money coincides with zero population growth, the economy is said to rest in &quot;steady-state equilibrium&quot;.

Superneutrality of money is a stronger property than neutrality of money. It holds that not only is the real economy unaffected by the &quot;level of the money supply&quot; but also that the &quot;rate of money supply growth&quot; has no effect on real variables. In this case, nominal wages and prices remain proportional to the nominal money supply not only in response to one-time permanent changes in the nominal money supply but also in response to permanent changes in the growth rate of the nominal money supply. Typically superneutrality is addressed in the context of long-run models.

== History of the concept ==
According to Don Patinkin, the concept of monetary neutrality goes back as far as David Hume. The term itself was first used by continental economists beginning at the turn of the 20th century, and exploded as a special topic in the English language economic literature upon Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s introduction of the term and concept in his famous 1931 LSE lectures published as Prices and Production. Keynes rejected neutrality of money both in the short term and in the long term.

== Views and counterviews ==
Many economists maintain that money neutrality is a good approximation for how the economy behaves over long periods of time but that in the short run monetary-disequilibrium theory applies, such that the nominal money supply would affect output. One argument is that prices and especially wages are sticky (because of menu costs, etc.), and cannot be adjusted immediately to an unexpected change in the money supply. An alternative explanation for real economic effects of money supply changes is not that people &quot;cannot&quot; change prices but that they do not realize that it is in their interest to do so. The bounded rationality approach suggests that small contractions in the money supply are not taken into account when individuals sell their houses or look for work, and that they will therefore spend longer searching for a completed contract than without the monetary contraction. Furthermore, the floor on nominal wages changes imposed by most companies is observed to be zero: an arbitrary number by the theory of monetary neutrality but a psychological threshold due to money illusion.

Neutrality of money has been a central question for monetarism. The most important answers were elaborated within the framework of the Phillips curve. Milton Friedman, assuming adaptive expectations, distinguished a series of short-run Phillips curves and a long-run one, where the short-run curves were supposed to be the conventional, negatively sloped curves, while the long-run curve was actually a vertical line indicating the natural rate of unemployment. According to Friedman, money was not neutral in the short run, because economic agents, confused by the money illusion, always respond to changes in the money supply. If the monetary authority chooses to increase the stock of money and, hence, the price level, agents will be never able to distinguish real and nominal changes, so they will regard the increase in nominal wages as real modifications, so labour supply will also be boosted. However, this change is only temporary, since agents will soon realize the actual state of affairs. As the higher wages were accompanied by higher prices, no real changes in income occurred, that is, it was no need to increase the labour supply. In the end, the economy, after this short detour, will return to the starting point, or in other words, to the natural rate of unemployment.

New classical macroeconomics, led by Robert E. Lucas, also has its own Phillips curve. However, things are far more complicated in these models, since rational expectations were presumed. For Lucas, the islands model made up the general framework in which the mechanisms underlying the Phillips curve could be scrutinized. The purpose of the first Lucasian island model (1972) was to establish a framework to support the understanding of the nature of the relationship between inflation and real economic performance by assuming that this relation offers no trade-off exploitable by economic policy. Lucas&#x27; intention was to prove that the Phillips curve &quot;exists without existing&quot;. It has been a heritage that there is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment or real economic performance, so it is undoubted that there is a short run Phillips curve (or there are short run Phillips curves). Although there are fewer possible actions available for the monetary policy to conceit people in order to increase the labour supply, unexpected changes can always trigger real changes. But what is the ultimate purpose of the central bank when changing the money supply? For example, and mostly: exerting countercyclical control. Doing so, monetary policy would increase the money supply in order to eliminate the negative effects of an unfavourable macroeconomic shock. However, monetary policy is not able to utilize the trade-off between inflation and real economic performance, because there is no information available in advance about the shocks to eliminate. Under these conditions, the central bank is unable to plan a course of action, that is, a countercyclical monetary policy. Rational agents can be conceited only by unexpected changes, so a well-known economic policy is completely in vain. However, and this is the point, the central bank cannot outline unforeseeable interventions in advance, because it has no informational advantage over the agents. &quot;The central bank has no information about what to eliminiate through countercyclical actions&quot;. The trade-off between inflation and unemployment exists, but it cannot be utilized by the monetary policy for countercyclical purposes.

The New Keynesian research program in particular emphasizes models in which money is not neutral in the short run, and therefore monetary policy can affect the real economy.

Post-Keynesian economics and monetary circuit theory reject the neutrality of money, instead emphasizing the role that bank lending and credit play in the creation of bank money. Post-Keynesians also emphasize the role that &quot;nominal&quot; debt plays: since the nominal amount of debt is not in general linked to inflation, inflation erodes the real value of nominal debt, and deflation increases it, causing real economic effects, as in debt-deflation.

The Austrian school of economics also rejects the theory of the neutrality of money, arguing that the money newly created by Central Banks (through the Open market operation system), or by primary banks (through Fractional-reserve banking system), is always given first to some specific branches of the economy, as in the construction segment, or agriculture, causing those segments that first receive money to not to be affected by the price inflation (as the Austrian school also claims that printed and effectively distributed money (M1) causes price inflation).

==Reasons for departure from superneutrality==

Even if money is neutral, so that the level of the money supply at any time has no influence on real magnitudes, money could still be non-superneutral: the &quot;growth rate&quot; of the money supply could affect real variables. A rise in the monetary growth rate, and the resulting rise in the inflation rate, lead to a decline in the real return on narrowly defined (zero-nominal-interest-bearing) money. Therefore, people choose to re-allocate their asset holdings away from money (that is, there is a decrease in real money demand) and into real assets such as goods inventories or even productive assets. The shift in money demand can affect the supply of loanable funds, and the combined changes in the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate may leave real interest rates changed from previously. If so, real expenditure on physical capital and durable consumer goods can be affected.

<text>James Brooks Ayres Robertson (March 15, 1871 – March 7, 1938), sometimes called J. B. A. Robertson, was an American lawyer, judge and the fourth governor of Oklahoma. Robertson was appointed by the state&#x27;s first governor, Charles N. Haskell, to serve as a district judge.

Passing a bar exam at the age of 21, Robertson became one of the most resourceful trial lawyers and legal counselors in the Oklahoma and Indian territories, before statehood. His gubernatorial term was marked by Oklahoma&#x27;s ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment, for Prohibition, and the Nineteenth Amendment, for women&#x27;s suffrage, to the United States Constitution, the Tulsa Race Massacre, and scandals. He also served as Grand Sire (now known as Sovereign Grand Master) of the Sovereign Grand Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows from 1915 to 1916.

Robertson died in 1938 from cancer and is buried in Chandler, Oklahoma.

==Early life==
James Brooks Ayres Robertson the Third was born in Keokuk County, Iowa, on March 15, 1871, to a father of the same name from Pennsylvania and mother Clara Robertson (birth name unknown) from Ohio. His paternal grandfather had the same name. In the early 1850s, both of Robertson&#x27;s parents moved to Iowa, where Robertson&#x27;s father served as a volunteer soldier in the Union army during the American Civil War. Robertson&#x27;s Iowa upbringing would instill in him firm progressive attitudes.

The fifth child born to a family of six sons and five daughters, Robertson was educated in the Iowa public school system. Robertson became a licensed teacher when he was 16. While teaching, he was privately studying law and the legal system, and he passed the Iowa bar exam in 1892 at the age of 21. The following year, Robertson moved to Chandler in Oklahoma Territory.

Chandler was newly established by European Americans via the Land Run on September 28, 1891, and the county seat of Lincoln County was developing. Seizing the opportunity, Robertson set up teaching and practicing law in the fledgling city. He won him the office of county attorney, the chief legal officer of the county. While in Chandler, Robertson met Olive Stubblefield, whom he married in 1898. They had two children: Olive Frances and a boy James Brooks Ayres Robertson IV (referred to as James Brooks Ayers Robertson Jr.), named after his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.

Robertson became known as one of the most resourceful trial lawyers and legal counselors in the Oklahoma and Indian territories. In 1906, Robertson became a partner in Hoffman and Robertson, a law firm he practiced with for the next two years.

==Political career==
Oklahoma was admitted to the Union as a state in 1907. The first governor of Oklahoma, Charles N. Haskell, named Robertson to the District Court of the Tenth Judicial District of Oklahoma in 1908. The job required Robertson to move his family from Chandler to Oklahoma City, where he spent the rest of his years.

Before his appointment to the court, Robertson played an active role in the Oklahoma and national Democratic parties. He offered to help any Democratic candidate in any way he could. On a trip with Governor Haskell to Denver, Robertson represented the Oklahoma Democratic Party. Robertson zealously supported the Democratic nomination of William Jennings Bryan for the presidency.

Robertson continued to serve as a judge until Governor Charles Haskell, now his friend, chose not to seek re-election in 1910. Resigning his seat on the court to run for governor, Robertson ultimately withdrew from the Democratic primary to support Lee Cruce. The latter won the party&#x27;s nomination and served as the second governor of Oklahoma.

In 1911, Robertson was appointed to the first Oklahoma Supreme Court Commission.

Not satisfied with returning to private life, Robertson ran for Congress. Reapportionment after the 1910 Federal Census had resulted in Oklahoma being granted three seats in the United States Congress. Robertson ran in the Democratic primary for his district&#x27;s seat, but he failed to receive the party&#x27;s nomination.

Robertson returned to private law practice in Oklahoma City. In 1914, Governor Cruce, like Haskell before him, decided against running for a second term. Robertson tried to get the Democratic nomination for governor, but Robert L. Williams, the popular former Chief Justice of Oklahoma, won it instead.

Robertson&#x27;s beloved wife Olive died on June 1, 1914, leaving Robertson to raise their two children. He married Isabelle Butler Robertson on November 28, 1917.

==Gubernatorial campaign==
Robertson&#x27;s persistence in politics paid off. In 1918, seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination for the third consecutive time, Robertson defeated the colorful and popular William H. Murray.

The popularity of former Governor Charles N. Haskell had strengthened the already strong position of the Oklahoma Democratic Party in the state. In 1910 a new party had appeared in Oklahoma politics, the Socialist Party of America. For the first time in Oklahoma&#x27;s history, the two major parties were joined by a third party in the contest for governor. Robertson faced Republican Horace G. McKeever, and Socialist Patrick S. Nagle A major factor in the election was the infamous Green Corn Rebellion of 1917, which the Socialist Party had helped cause. Many voters considered them unpatriotic. Robertson won in a landslide, and other state Democratic candidates won considerable majorities in both the Oklahoma House of Representatives and Oklahoma Senate.

==Governor of Oklahoma==
Robertson was inaugurated on January 13, 1919, as Oklahoma&#x27;s fourth governor. He was soon faced with two national issues: nationwide prohibition and women&#x27;s suffrage.

Under Governor Haskell, Oklahoma had already adopted a firm policy against alcohol. Robertson worked to build on Haskell&#x27;s policies, leading Oklahoma to overwhelmingly ratify the Eighteenth Amendment, which was added to the United States Constitution on January 16, 1919.

Written with progressivism in mind, Oklahoma&#x27;s constitution enshrined the right to vote for all races and both women and men. But the state had passed amendments and laws that in practice disenfranchised most blacks by creating barriers to voter registration. Robertson called a special session of the white-dominated legislature that led to the state&#x27;s ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. It became part of the national Constitution on August 18, 1920.

Among Robertson&#x27;s accomplishments included the passage of various labor laws and the creation of the office of Oklahoma Commissioner of Pensions. He also established cooperative marketing agencies to serve the state&#x27;s farmers, who suffered low prices due to agricultural overproduction continuing after World War I had driven up demand. Robertson also ushered a bill through the legislature providing for the addition of over of paved roads, more than had been paved in all three previous administrations.

Partly using his experience as a teacher, Robertson also focused on improving Oklahoma&#x27;s school system. First, he worked to change how colleges operated in Oklahoma. Before his administration, colleges had been supervised by the State Board of Education under the State School Superintendent. Under Robertson, the governor&#x27;s power over colleges increased with the creation of a Board of State Regents, its members appointed by the governor, to oversee all institutions of higher education. In his budgets, Robertson also funded improvements in teacher certification, higher standards for school performance and accreditation, consolidation of many rural schools, and institution of a subsidized textbook program. He proposed increased funding for schools with apparent inadequacies, but this measure was rejected by the legislature.

Robertson also had setbacks. His administration&#x27;s work on Oklahoma&#x27;s highways was a vast improvement to what the state had had, but it was not sufficient to catch up to the need. He failed to get voter support for the $50 million in necessary highway improvements. Although the Socialist Party was no longer a political threat, it advocated strikes. In 1919, telephone workers struck in Drumright, Oklahoma, and a massive strike of coal miners took place in eastern Oklahoma. Governor Robertson, in his position as Commander-in-Chief, declared martial law in these regions. The Bank Guaranty Program, which Governor Haskell had instituted, collapsed following Oklahoma&#x27;s recession in 1920, resulting in the closure of many state banks.

Robertson&#x27;s administration struggled with the economic effects of a downturn in the oil industry, and nationwide recession, and the poor economy added to racial tensions in the state. The postwar period was one of the worst in race relations in Oklahoma&#x27;s history. To help confront this issue, Robertson created a commission on racial relations composed of both white and black members, but it did little to improve things.
In the early morning hours of June 1, 1921, a race riot broke out in Tulsa, where white mobs looted and burned most of Greenwood, the prosperous center of the African-American community in the city. During the 16 hours of rioting, an estimated 300 people were killed (mostly black Republicans), more than 800 people were admitted to local hospitals with injuries, thousands of blacks were left homeless, as 35 city blocks with 1,256 residences were destroyed by fire, and property damage totaled $1.8 million (nearly $17 million as of 2001 after adjustment for inflation). Robertson finally regained control in the city by declaring martial law and sending in the Oklahoma National Guard to police the area and end the chaos. The governor condemned actions by the city and Sheriff&#x27;s Office and ordered a Grand Jury to investigate, but no one was prosecuted for the deaths, injuries, or damage. An estimated 3,000 blacks fled the city at the time. The riot affected Oklahoma for generations to come, promoting nativism, stimulating growth of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan for the first time in Oklahoma, and suppressing blacks&#x27; hopes for their lives in the state.

To make matters worse politically, under Robertson&#x27;s guard the Democrats lost control of the Oklahoma Legislature. Following the 1920 midterm elections, the Republicans gained control of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. Also, the U.S. presidency shifted from Democrat Woodrow Wilson to Republican Warren G. Harding. Oklahoma lost its Democratic U.S. senator, Thomas Gore, who was replaced by John W. Harreld, the first Republican from Oklahoma to serve in the United States Senate. Robertson was left with a divided legislature. He was not successful in gaining passage for his proposed policies for the remaining two years of his term.

Scandals haunted Robertson&#x27;s administration during the remainder of his term. Disputes between the Republican House and Democratic Senate resulted in the House&#x27;s investigation of the executive branch, most notably Robertson himself. As in the case of Governor Lee Cruce before him, the House came within one vote of impeaching Robertson.

In 1921 the House adjourned without voting on appropriation bills. This forced Robertson to operate the government on deficit spending until he called a special session of the legislature to resolve the issue. Robertson also faced considerable opposition from the Republican Corporation Commissioner Campbell Russell, who exposed what the Republicans believed to be a scandal in Robertson&#x27;s handling of pardons and paroles.

With the inauguration of John C. Walton as the fifth governor, Robertson left office on January 8, 1923.

==Later life, arrest, and death==
As a private citizen, Robertson resumed practicing law. Following his departure from office, Robertson, along with some 30 current and former state officials, was charged with bribery in a bank scandal. On the evening of March 22, 1922, Robertson submitted to his arrest in Okmulgee County. Earlier that day a grand jury which investigated the failure of state banks in Okmulgee County, named Robertson and Fred G. Dennis, former state banking commissioner, in an indictment. He was acquitted, but the episode hurt his political career. He ran for governor again, for Oklahoma Supreme Court justice, and for U.S. senator, but he never held another political office, appointed or elected.

Robertson died of cancer on March 7, 1938, in Oklahoma City. He was buried in his adoptive hometown of Chandler in Oak Park Cemetery.

<text>Edinburgh University Students&#x27; Association (EUSA) is the students&#x27; union at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. The Association&#x27;s aim is the advancement of education of Edinburgh students by representing and supporting them, and by promoting their interests, health and welfare within the community. It is led by a team of five elected student sabbatical officers.

Due to the evolution of student unionism at Edinburgh, student sports are not part of the main university union, and are overseen by a separate organisation, Edinburgh University Sports Union (EUSU), which has its own representative and organisational structure. EUSU works closely with the university&#x27;s Centre for Sport and Exercise.

==History==

=== 1884–1972: Establishment ===
An Edinburgh students&#x27; representative council (SRC) was founded in 1884 by student Robert Fitzroy Bell, bringing together students from the university&#x27;s clubs &amp; societies. Shortly afterwards, the SRC voted to establish a union (the Edinburgh University Union (EUU)), to provide social space and recreational facilities for students. The SRC established a campaign of public fundraising, with prominent figures in the city and the general public donating £5,000, and a fancy fair held at the Waverly Market raised £10,000. The Town Council and Senatus Academicus donated £100 and £500 respectively to the cause. This £15,600 (£2,000,000 in 2019 money) was used to hire an architect, Sydney Mitchell, and begin construction of the Union building adjacent to the Medical School and the Reid Concert Hall. Teviot Row House was officially opened on 19 October 1889, and is the oldest purpose-built student union in the world. EUU was constituted as an autonomous organisation, and did not admit women until 1971.

The Edinburgh University Women&#x27;s Union was founded in October 1905, later moving to premises at 16 Chambers Street and renaming itself to the Chambers Street Union in 1964. The King&#x27;s Buildings Union was established in 1931 in huts formerly used by the Geology department, before moving into a custom building in 1939.

=== 1970–2000: Merger ===
On 1 July 1973 the SRC, the EUU and the Chambers Street Union merged to form Edinburgh University Students&#x27; Association. Due to reference in the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, the SRC could not be dissolved at the time of merger. Through the SRC, EUSA is the oldest students&#x27; union in the UK. In 1994 the university forced the merger of the King&#x27;s Buildings Union and EUSA, although the members of KB Union voted against the proposed merger.

Due to the university merging with other organisations, since 1994, EUSA has merged with the Moray House Institute of Education Union and the Edinburgh College of Art Union.

In 1976 EUSA disaffiliated from the National Union of Students (NUS), a decision that was reversed in 2004. In 2005 EUSA formally twinned with Birzeit University Student Council, West Bank, with each union hosting delegations from the other.

=== 2000–present ===
Following a student consultation process and a referendum in February 2012 a new constitution was established in 2011 and amended in 2013. This took full effect in 2014, incorporating the Association as a charitable company limited by guarantee. This constitution also had the effect of changing some democratic processes, including establishing the board of trustees in its current form.

In 2016 EUSA became the first students union in the UK to affiliate to Students for Cooperation as an affiliated supporter in order to promote and support student-led cooperatives. EUSA submitted a proposal to NUS Scotland for affiliation with Students for Cooperation, which was accepted.
Also in 2016, EUSA sabbatical officers and management submitted a referendum to the student membership over whether to change the Association&#x27;s name to &quot;University of Edinburgh Students&#x27; Union&quot;, alongside a number of internal administrative changes. The name change was rejected by 69.9% of students. EUSA then embarked on a major rebranding programme, changing the logo and encouraging the organisation to be referred to as &quot;the Association&quot;, or &quot;your Students&#x27; Association&quot; instead of &quot;EUSA&quot;.

===Controversy===
EUSA was criticised in 2013 after acting using the Court of Session to &quot;censor&quot; &quot;The Student&quot; as it &quot;was due to publish details of the suspension of Max Crema, vice-president of services at the union&quot;. President James McAsh defended the action, claiming it was taken &quot;to protect the rights of our employees&quot;.

In 2013, EUSA made the decision to ban the playing of &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; by Robin Thicke in its venues, attracting some attention in national media. The song was deemed to promote &quot;an unhealthy attitude towards sex and consent&quot;, and for being in breach of EUSA&#x27;s &#x27;End Rape Culture and Lad Banter on Campus&#x27; policy, designed to tackle &#x27;myths and stereotypes around sexual violence&#x27; and stop the sexual objectification of female students.

In 2014, EUSA was threatened with legal proceedings by the National Secretary of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), Charlie Kimber, following a motion put forward banning the SWP from the Edinburgh campus due to the &#x27;Comrade Delta&#x27; rape scandal. EUSA eventually withdrew the motion. This also resulted in the editors of &quot;The Student&quot; newspaper, an EUSA society, manually ripping pages out of their own newspapers to avoid personal legal liability, as the story about the motion had already been printed before it was withdrawn.

==Activities==
EUSA&#x27;s activities include representing and campaigning on behalf of students, the administration of societies, running a network of bars and other venues, organising volunteering opportunities and providing numerous welfare and advice services. EUSA also directly organises regular events such as Freshers&#x27; Week, club nights, pub quizzes, band nights, various comedy events, and the Graduation Ball.

===Campaigning===

Since 2010, EUSA has supported campaigns for same-sex marriage, against tuition fee rises and education cuts, and for better private tenancy rights; EUSA also lobbies the university on internal issues, such as on-campus child care. It has also had a significant role in the overhaul of the university&#x27;s student support structure, and in making Edinburgh Scotland&#x27;s first Fairtrade University in 2004. In 2007, following several years of pressure from EUSA, the University Senate revoked Robert Mugabe&#x27;s honorary degree that had been awarded in 1984 &quot;for services to education in Africa&quot;.

===Societies===

EUSA supports and oversees over 280 affiliated societies. There are societies for most academic disciplines, political parties, nationalities and minority groups. Its oldest society, The Diagnostic Society of Edinburgh pre-dates the SRC but is currently merged under EUSA whilst still retaining general operative independence.

Student theatre at Edinburgh is particularly active. The Edinburgh University Theatre Company (EUTC) was founded in 1896 as the Edinburgh University Drama Society, and since the early 1980s has run Bedlam Theatre, the oldest student-run theatre in Britain, and The Improverts, the city&#x27;s longest-running improvised comedy troupe. Edinburgh University Footlights and Edinburgh University Savoy Opera Group (EUSOG) are musical theatre societies, the latter having an emphasis towards the Savoy operas of Gilbert and Sullivan. Theatre Paradok are dedicated to experimental theatre.

Music is a large part of EUSA&#x27;s output. The Edinburgh University Music Society founded in 1867 is the second oldest music society in the United Kingdom. With a Symphonic Chorus of up to 200 members, a full size Symphony Orchestra and Sinfonia, EUMS performs up to seven concerts a year in the university. The university is also home to the Edinburgh University Renaissance Singers conducted by University Lecturer Dr Paul Newton-Jackson.

Media-themed societies include The Student (Edinburgh&#x27;s own student newspaper), Fresh Air (a student radio station, online-only since 2008), the Edinburgh Movie Production Society (EMPS), the Edinburgh Film Society and most recently EUTV, Edinburgh University Television Station.

Charitable and campaigning societies are numerous, including Edinburgh Global Partnerships and the Edinburgh branches of the Nightline support hotline and People &amp; Planet charitable network.

LGBT+ Pride is represented by five EUSA groups: LGBT+ Medics, LGBTQ+ Campaign, LGBTQ+ Law Society, LGBTQ+ Peer Mentoring, and PrideSoc.

===Buildings, venues and outlets===
EUSA operates 13 bars, 7 catering outlets, 5 shops, a catering company (&quot;Honours Catering&quot;) and numerous other services located across various sites. Most of these buildings are operated as Edinburgh Fringe venues during August.
* Teviot Row House is the largest EUSA building and the oldest purpose built student union building in the world. Located on Bristo Square, Teviot contains six bars (The Library Bar, The Sports Bar, The New Amphion, The Lounge Bar (informally known as The Jazz Bar), Teviot Underground and The Loft Bar), a small nightclub (&quot;Teviot Underground&quot;) and a variety of meeting rooms and halls. Following a fire at Gilded Balloon&#x27;s Grassmarket venue, Teviot is now their primary base during the Fringe.
* The Pleasance provides EUSA societies with meeting space during semesters. It also has two bars and a theatre with an approximate capacity of 300. It is located next to the university&#x27;s Centre for Sport and Exercise. During the Fringe, The Pleasance is run by the Pleasance Theatre Trust Ltd as the &quot;Pleasance Courtyard&quot;.
* Potterrow, is also located on Bristo Square. With its distinctive dome, this building includes two shops, two cafes, a 1200 capacity nightclub, the Activities Office, a student support centre (The Advice Place) and EUSA&#x27;s main administrative offices. Potterrow is also run by the Pleasance Theatre Trust during the Fringe, along with many other Fringe venues, and is branded as the &quot;Pleasance Dome&quot;.
* King&#x27;s Buildings is the home of most of the College of Science and Engineering, located in the south of the city. King&#x27;s Buildings House includes a bar and food outlet, a small gym, a branch of the Advice Place and a small shop. The Magnet Cafe is located in the James Clerk Maxwell Building, and there is another shop on the ground floor of the KB Centre.
* Pollock Shop is a late opening shop in Pollock Halls.
* The Peffermill Clubhouse is a bar located at the university playing fields at Peffermill.

==Structure==
EUSA is a democratic membership organisation, a charitable body and a company limited by guarantee, ultimately overseen by a Board of Trustees.

All Edinburgh University students automatically become members of EUSA upon matriculation, though they retain the ability to opt out as per the Education Act 1994.

The Association&#x27;s day-to-day student leadership is provided by a team of five full-time elected students, the Sabbatical Officers, currently:
* President – responsible for the overall functioning and external politics of the association;
* Vice President Activities and Services (VPAS) – responsible for activities in relation to student societies and representation to the university and Students&#x27; Association on non-academic service provision;
* Vice President Community (VPC) – responsible for lobbying the university for affordable transport and housing, as well as campaigning on sustainability and community engagement
* Vice President Education (VPE) – responsible for representing students to the university and beyond on HE and academic matters
* Vice President Welfare (VPW) – responsible for representing students to the university and beyond on student welfare

Democracy is primarily provided through an open Student Council, which holds elected Officers to account, and creates policy. The Student Council meets in Teviot Row House on the last Thursday in each month during term-time.

Elections are held twice a year, the Spring election and the Postgraduate election in Autumn. The Sabbatical Officers, School Representatives, Section Representatives, Activities Representatives and Liberation Officers are elected in the Spring Elections in an online ballot. Postgraduate positions and any positions not filled in the Spring election are elected in the Postgraduate elections, also held via an online ballot and open to all members of the Association.

These elected representatives form a number of bodies that work throughout the year. The Activities Executive makes decisions relating specifically to student societies, composed of the Vice President (Activities &amp; Services) and activities representatives elected to represent a specific society category. There are a series of open liberation groups (Black Minority and Ethnic, Disabled Students, LGBT, and Women) and student section groups (International, Mature, Carers, Parents, Postgraduate Taught, Postgraduate Research, and Part-Time).

Elected representatives also sit on all major University bodies and subcommittees. Complementing these structures are autonomous school councils and a class representation system providing local, democratic spaces for organising. This organisational structure was designed to help foster a system of participatory democracy throughout the university.

EUSA&#x27;s financial, legal and employment matters are the responsibility of the Chief Executive and a senior management team, who report to and are held accountable by a Board of Trustees, which currently consists of:
* The five Sabbatical officers
* Four student trustees, appointed by the sabbatical trustees for two years.
* Three external trustees, appointed by the student trustees for no more than three years.
Each Trustee may serve a maximum of two terms. Sabbatical officers must be re-elected to office, and Elected or Student Trustees may serve a second term with approval of the board of trustees.

EUSA has a fully owned subsidiary company, &quot;EUSACO&quot;, incorporating any activity which is outside EUSA&#x27;s charitable remit, such as the Edinburgh Fringe and external catering activities. Responsibility for EUSA&#x27;s commercial services is delegated by the board of trustees to the Strategic Development Subcommittee.

<text>Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show (shortened to Dr. Hook in 1975) is an American rock band formed in Union City, New Jersey. The band had commercial success in the 1970s with hit singles &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Mother&quot; (1972), &quot;The Cover of &#x27;Rolling Stone&#x27;&quot; (1973), &quot;Only Sixteen&quot; (1976), &quot;A Little Bit More&quot; (1976), &quot;Walk Right In&quot; (1977), &quot;Sharing the Night Together&quot; (1978), &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love with a Beautiful Woman&quot; (1979) and &quot;Better Love Next Time&quot; (1979). In addition to its own material, Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show performed songs written by the poet Shel Silverstein.

The band had eight years of hits in the United States. Its music, spanning acoustic ballads and soft rock, was played on Top 40, easy listening and country music outlets throughout the English-speaking world. In recent years the band&#x27;s mellower &#x27;70s hits such as &quot;Sharing the Night Together&quot; (1978) and &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love with a Beautiful Woman&quot; (1979) have also received regular airplay on Yacht Rock Radio on SiriusXM. 

==History==
=== Founding of the band ===
The founding core of the band consisted of George Cummings, Ray Sawyer and Billy Francis, who had first worked together circa 1966 in Mobile, Alabama in a band called Chocolate Papers. Cummings, Sawyer and Francis started a new band up in Union City, New Jersey in 1968 and included primary vocalist Dennis Locorriere, who initially joined as a bass player.

By 1969, the new band was named Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show: Tonic for the Soul. The name, thought up by Cummings, was inspired by Sawyer&#x27;s eyepatch and a reference to Captain Hook of the Peter Pan fairy tale. Sawyer lost his right eye in a near-fatal car crash in Oregon in 1967 and, after that, wore an eyepatch, leading some people to believe that &quot;he&quot; was Dr Hook; when asked by fans which band member was Dr Hook, they would all point to the bus driver.

=== Career: 1968-1971 ===
Popeye Phillips, who had been the drummer in Chocolate Papers, left the band to become a session musician, contributing to the first album by the Flying Burrito Brothers. Drummer Joseph Olivier was the drummer by the time Cummings, Sawyer and Francis had relocated to New Jersey. Just before Dr. Hook began recording its first demos, Olivier was replaced by session drummer Jay David, who became a band member in 1970.

In 1970, the band&#x27;s demo tapes were heard by Ron Haffkine, musical director on &quot;Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me?&quot;. Haffkine asked the band to record two songs for the film, including &quot;The Last Morning&quot; and &quot;Bunky and Lucille&quot;, which the band can be seen performing in the movie. The film helped Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show secure their first recording contract.

In 1971, the group met with Clive Davis of CBS Records. David used a wastebasket in the meeting to keep the beat, and Francis danced on the mogul&#x27;s desk while Sawyer, Locorriere, and Cummings played and sang. With the CBS Records deal, the band experienced international success with Haffkine as the group&#x27;s manager and producer.

In 1972, after recording their debut album, the band added a full-time bassist, Jance Garfat, and another guitarist, Rik Elswit.

=== Career: 1972 ===
Haffkine, having a knack for picking songs, quickly became Dr. Hook&#x27;s No. 1 A&amp;R man and their producer and manager. Shel Silverstein wrote all the songs for their self-titled debut album, released in May 1972. &quot;Doctor Hook&quot; featured lead vocals, guitar, bass and harmonica by Locorriere, steel guitarist Cummings and singer Sawyer, plus drummer David and keyboard player Billy Francis. The album sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA on August 2, 1972. It has been released 20 times in the US, Canada and Europe. The single &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Mother&quot;, a subtle parody of teen-heartbreak weepers, flopped on first release, but with some more promotional muscle, became the band&#x27;s first million-seller and hit the top five in the summer of 1972.

Silverstein continued to write songs for Dr. Hook, including their entire second album, &quot;Sloppy Seconds&quot;, released in the US, Australia, Europe and Canada in February 1973. It featured some of their most famous songs, including &quot;Freakin&#x27; at the Freaker&#x27;s Ball&quot; and &quot;The Cover of &#x27;Rolling Stone&#x27;&quot;. The album was listed in the Billboard 200 in 1973.

The band&#x27;s second single, &quot;The Cover of &#x27;Rolling Stone&#x27;&quot; (December 1972), was another million-selling disc in early 1973, poking fun at the idea that a musician had &quot;made it&quot; if they had been pictured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. Haffkine visited Jann Wenner, one of the founders of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, proclaiming, &quot;I&#x27;ve just given you guys the best commercial for this rag that you&#x27;ll ever get.&quot; Wenner then sent Cameron Crowe (who later wrote and directed &quot;Almost Famous&quot; about his time as a music journalist), then 16 years old, to interview the band for issue 131 (March 1973). Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show appeared on the cover, albeit in caricature rather than in a photograph. In the United Kingdom, the BBC Radio network refused to play &quot;The Cover of &#x27;Rolling Stone&#x27;&quot;, because it considered doing so would be advertising a trademark name. CBS Records responded by setting up a phone line to play the song to anyone willing to dial in, which helped build the buzz. The BBC found itself able to play the song only after some of its DJs edited themselves shouting the words &quot;Radio Times&quot; (a BBC-owned magazine) over &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

=== Career: 1973-1974 ===

The group had difficulty meeting the high expectations created by &quot;Sloppy Seconds&quot; and the result was &quot;Belly Up!&quot; (November 1973), which was unfortunately prophetic. The album was sold in the US, UK, Europe and Canada. Dr. Hook was just as famed for their crazed stage antics, ranging from surreal banter to impersonating their opening acts; the group&#x27;s disregard for business matters led to bankruptcy. &quot;If we were in the black when we finished a tour, we&#x27;d party into the red,&quot; says Locorriere. They were forced to file bankruptcy in 1974, although they continued to tour incessantly.

The Medicine Show&#x27;s lineup changed a few more times over the years. When David left the group in 1973, he was replaced by John Wolters. The next to depart was founding band member Cummings, who left in August 1975 due to illness, plus personal and musical differences. The band did not replace him. When Elswit was diagnosed with cancer in 1976, the band added Bob &quot;Willard&quot; Henke (formerly of Goose Creek Symphony). Elswit recovered and returned to the lineup, but they kept Henke on for a while.

In 1974, Dr. Hook recorded an album that was to be titled &quot;Fried Face&quot;; it was not released.

===Career: 1975-1985===
The band shortened its name to Dr. Hook in 1975. They signed with Capitol Records in 1975, releasing the aptly titled &quot;Bankrupt&quot;. Unlike previous projects, this album included original material written by the group. The hit from the project was a reworked version of Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Only Sixteen&quot; (US number 6), revitalizing their career and charted in the top ten in 1976.

Haffkine discovered a song titled &quot;A Little Bit More&quot; written and originally performed by Bobby Gosh and released on his 1973 album &quot;Sitting in the Quiet&quot;, on a record he purchased for 35 cents at a flea market in San Francisco. The band recorded and released the song, which reached number 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and spent two weeks at number nine on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100. It also reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, matching &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Mother&quot;.

The band followed &quot;Bankrupt&quot; with 1976&#x27;s &quot;A Little Bit More&quot; (named after the hit), which was certified double gold in Australia in November 1976. It was quickly followed in turn by the 1977 album &quot;Making Love And Music&quot; which gave them a number 1 hit single in Australia with &quot;Walk Right In&quot;, then came &quot;Pleasure &amp; Pain&quot; (October 1978), which featured &quot;Sharing the Night Together&quot; (US number 6) and &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love with a Beautiful Woman&quot; (US number 6). &quot;Sometimes You Win&quot; (October 1979) brought forth &quot;Better Love Next Time&quot; (US number 12) in late 1979 and &quot;Sexy Eyes&quot; (US number 5) in 1980. Save for &quot;A Little Bit More&quot; (US number 11), these singles were certified million-sellers. &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love with a Beautiful Woman&quot; reached number 1 for several weeks in 1979 in the UK. Though the band toured constantly, they had yet to manage to turn their success with singles into album sales.

&quot;Pleasure and Pain&quot; was Dr. Hook&#x27;s first gold album in the US. The band changed labels again to Casablanca Records in 1980, but could not replicate earlier successes. In late 1980, Dr. Hook released &quot;Girls Can Get It&quot; (US number 34) and had their final top 40 hit (which peaked in the US at number 25) with &quot;Baby Makes Her Blue-Jeans Talk&quot; in 1982.

Guitarist Rod Smarr replaced Henke on guitar in 1980, Walter Hartman subbed for Wolters on drums from 1982–1983 and Leonard Wolfe played keyboards alongside Francis in 1983–1985.

Ray Sawyer left in 1983 to pursue a solo career, while the band continued to tour for another couple of years, ending with Dr. Hook&#x27;s One and Only Farewell Tour in 1985, with Locorriere as the sole frontman.

=== After Dr. Hook: 1985 to present ===
After Dr. Hook split up, Dennis Locorriere retained ownership of the band&#x27;s name. However, from 1988 to 2015, Sawyer was granted a license to tour separately as &quot;Ray Sawyer of Dr. Hook&quot; or &quot;Dr. Hook featuring Ray Sawyer&quot; (joined for a time in 2001 by Billy Francis); Sawyer did not perform publicly after his last tour ended in October 2015 and died on December 31, 2018, at the age of 81.

Billy Francis, after joining Sawyer in 2001 during his Dr. Hook concerts, died on May 23, 2010, at age 68.

After the original band split, Dennis Locorriere released several solo albums and toured under the names &quot;Voice of Dr. Hook&quot; and &quot;Dennis Locorriere Celebrates Dr. Hook Hits and History Tour&quot;. Now fronting the band &quot;Dr Hook starring Dennis Locorriere&quot;, he started the &quot;Dr Hook 50th Anniversary World Tour&quot; in 2019, but this was postponed due to Locorriere undergoing a prostate procedure resulting in kidney
problems. The band resumed their 50th Anniversary Tour on September 3, 2021, with a show at Manchester&#x27;s Bridgewater Hall and with performances scheduled for Scandinavia, the UK and Ireland in 2022. Currently Locorriere&#x27;s version of Dr Hook is made up of John Maher, Michelle Cordelli, Damien Cooper, Tim Bye, Jon Poole and Ryan Farmery.

Former bass player Robert Jance Garfat (born March 3, 1944) 
died in a motorcycle accident on November 6, 2006 at age 62.

Former guitarist and keyboardist Bob &#x27;Willard&#x27; Henke died on February 2, 2023, at the age of 71. 

Bass vocalist George Cummings died on December 14, 2024.

<doc id="1231150" wikidata="Q965491" url="?curid=1231150" title="Merry Cemetery">
<text>The Merry Cemetery ( , ) is a cemetery in the village of Săpânța, Maramureș County, Romania. It is famous for its brightly coloured tombstones with naïve paintings describing, in an original and poetic manner, the people who are buried there in addition to scenes from their lives. The Merry Cemetery became an open-air museum and a national tourist attraction. It has been listed as one of the Seven Wonders of Romania by &quot;Imperator Travel&quot;.

The unusual feature of this cemetery is that it diverges from the prevalent belief, culturally shared within European societies, that views death as something indelibly solemn.

A collection of the epitaphs from the Merry Cemetery exists in a 2017 volume called &quot;Crucile de la Săpânța&quot;, compiled by author Roxana Mihalcea, as well as in a photography book titled The &quot;Merry Cemetery of Sapanta&quot; by Peter Kayafas.

==The founder==
The cemetery&#x27;s origins are linked with the name of Stan Ioan Pătraș, a local artist who sculpted the first tombstone crosses. In 1935, Pătraș carved the first epitaph and, as of the 1960s, more than 800 of such oak wood crosses came into sight. The inscription on his tombstone cross says:

==Humorous epitaphs==
The cemetery is noted for featuring a large number of humorous epitaphs that generally poke fun at the interred person in a light-hearted way or reference a general trope about family relations. The following is an example of an epitaph wrote by a man in honour of his mother-in-law:

<doc id="1231152" wikidata="Q6207539" url="?curid=1231152" title="Jockey Club Gold Cup">
<text>The Jockey Club Gold Cup, established in 1919, is a thoroughbred flat race open to horses of either gender three-years-old and up. It has traditionally been the main event of the fall meeting at Belmont Park, just as the Belmont Stakes is of the spring meeting and the Travers Stakes is of the summer meeting at Saratoga. The past winners of the Gold Cup are a veritable who&#x27;s who of award-winning Hall of Fame horses, including Easy Goer, Man o&#x27; War, Cigar, Skip Away, Curlin, Slew o&#x27; Gold, John Henry, Affirmed, Forego, Shuvee, Damascus, Buckpasser, Kelso, Sword Dancer, Nashua, Citation, Whirlaway and War Admiral. Despite the current $1,250,000 purse and Grade 1 status, the stature of the race has suffered somewhat in recent years thanks to the emergence of the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic held not long afterward, as well as a change in distance to miles in 1990, reducing its distinctiveness.

Part of the Breeders&#x27; Cup Challenge series, the winner of the Jockey Club Gold Cup automatically qualifies for the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic.

Before it was known as the Jockey Club Gold Cup, it began as the Jockey Club Stakes. This was its name when Man o&#x27; War won it against the only horse willing to race him. Damask, owned by Harry Payne Whitney, was entered as a sporting gesture and to keep Man o&#x27; War from having to run alone in a &quot;walkover.&quot; Damask finished 15 lengths behind with Man o&#x27; War held under strong restraint in order not to humiliate his rival. Even so, Man o&#x27; War broke the American record for a mile and a half.

Ten horses have won the race twice (including Hall of Fame horses Curlin, Skip Away, Slew o&#x27; Gold, Nashua and Triple Tiara winner, Shuvee). Only one horse in history has won the Cup five times, and that was the great gelding Kelso. 
In the 1978 running, Exceller defeated the previous year&#x27;s Triple Crown winner, Seattle Slew, by a nose in a memorable stretch duel, with the 1978 Triple Crown winner, Affirmed, finishing fifth after his saddle slipped. Sportswriter Bill Nack wrote, &quot;Exceller won by the snip of his chocolate nose. ... That battling final furlong remains Seattle Slew&#x27;s most enduring legacy as a racehorse.&quot;

From 1976 to 1989, the Jockey Club Gold Cup was run at miles, but from 1921 through 1975 it was long, second in distance only to the less prestigious, -mile Display Handicap. From 1958 through 1974, except for 1962 and 1968, the race was held at Aqueduct Racetrack instead of Belmont.

In 2021 the Jockey Club Gold Cup was moved to Saratoga Race Course for the first time in its history. The $1 million race is run on closing weekend and took the place of the Woodward Stakes, which was relocated to Belmont Park after being run in Saratoga for 15 years. NYRA management said that the Jockey Club Gold Cup – run at the same distance as the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic – was better positioned on the racing calendar with an eight-week gap between the two races.

<text>Minit Records was an American independent record label, originally based in New Orleans and founded by Joe Banashak in 1959. Ernie K-Doe, Aaron Neville, Irma Thomas, and Benny Spellman were early artists on the label. Later artists included Bobby Womack and Ike &amp; Tina Turner.

==History==

Allen Toussaint was responsible for much of the label&#x27;s early success, he wrote, produced, arranged and played piano on a number of tracks. The label&#x27;s first hit was Toussaint&#x27;s production of &quot;Ooh Poo Pah Doo - Part 2&quot; by Jessie Hill in 1960. After making a distribution deal with Imperial Records, the label released its biggest hit, &quot;Mother-in Law&quot; by Ernie K-Doe reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the R&amp;B singles chart in 1961.

When Allen Toussaint was drafted into the Army in 1963, the hits dried up and the label was sold to Imperial. Banashak also owned Instant Records, which he kept. Minit was acquired by Liberty Records in 1963 as part of its acquisition of Imperial Records. In 1968, Liberty was bought by Transamerica Corporation and combined with United Artists Records. Two years later Imperial and Minit were shut down and transferred to Liberty. In 1971, Liberty and its remaining labels (except for Soul City, whose catalog was sold to Bell Records) were absorbed into United Artists. In 1979, EMI purchased United Artists. The Minit catalog is currently owned by UMG, successor-in-interest to previous owner EMI.

==Label variations==

<text>Samarskite is a radioactive rare earth mineral series which includes samarskite-(Y), with the chemical formula and samarskite-(Yb), with the chemical formula . The formula for samarskite-(Y) is also given as .

Samarskite crystallizes in the orthorhombic – dipyramidal class as black to yellowish brown stubby prisms although it is typically found as anhedral masses. Specimens with a high uranium content are typically metamict and appear coated with a yellow brown earthy rind. 

Samarskite occurs in rare earth bearing granite pegmatites with other rare minerals. It occurs in association with columbite, zircon, monazite, uraninite, aeschynite, magnetite, albite, topaz, beryl, garnet, muscovite and biotite.

Samarskite was first described in 1847 for an occurrence in Miass, Ilmen Mountains, Southern Ural Mountains of Russia. The chemical element samarium was first isolated from a specimen of samarskite in 1879. Samarium was named after samarskite which was named for the Russian mine official, Colonel Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets (1803–1870).

Samarskite-(Yb) was first described in 2004 for an occurrence in the South Platte Pegmatite District, Jefferson County, Colorado.

<doc id="1231166" wikidata="Q1513841" url="?curid=1231166" title="Timoleague Friary">
<text>Timoleague Friary (), also known as Timoleague Abbey, is a ruined medieval Franciscan friary in Timoleague, County Cork, Ireland, on the banks of the Argideen River overlooking Courtmacsherry Bay. It was built on the site of an early Christian monastic site founded by Saint Molaga, from whom the town of Timoleague derives its name. The present remains date from roughly the turn of the fourteenth century and were burnt down by British forces in the mid-seventeenth century, at which point it was an important ecclesiastical centre that engaged in significant trade with Spain.

The friary is the largest medieval ruin in West Cork and one of the few early Franciscan friaries in Ireland to have substantial ruins. It is claustral in layout, and built in the Early English Gothic architectural style. It contains several elements atypical of Franciscan architecture of the period, including wall passages and exterior access to its upper floor. It was significantly altered in the early 16th and early 17th centuries. Several historical artefacts are associated with the friary, and during the Romantic era it was depicted in several notable artworks.

== History ==

=== Monastic site ===
The friary sits on a monastic site dedicated to Saint Molaga dating to either the 6th or 7th century. According to legend, this settlement was originally to be formed a mile west of Timoleague, but all work done on that site by day would fall down by morning. Interpreting this as God&#x27;s will that the friary be built elsewhere, Molaga supposedly placed a blessed candle on a sheaf of corn, and set it down the Argideen River, building his settlement on the spot that it came ashore, in an area overlooking Courtmacsherry Bay. The town derives its Irish name, or &quot;Molaga&#x27;s House&quot; from the saint.

=== Foundation and early history ===

The date of foundation by the Franciscans is disputed. Documentary evidence places the foundation of the friary between 1307 and 1316, though physical evidence suggests that a preexisting 13th-century building was incorporated into the site. According to the Annals of the Four Masters, the friary was founded in 1240 by the MacCarthy Reagh family. This has been identified as possibly being too early. Some sources ascribe this claimed foundation to Domhnall Got MacCarthy, while others claim that Got MacCarthy merely expanded the friary anywhere between 1312 and 1366. Domhnall&#x27;s grandson, Domhnall Glas MacCarthy, is also thought to have been a patron of the friary. Samuel Lewis, in &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland...&quot; (1837) writes that the MacCarthy&#x27;s founded the friary in 1312. The friary&#x27;s foundation has also been attributed to the Anglo-Norman de Barry family in the early 14th century. Though the friars were well established in Timoleague by 1320, the earliest surviving parts of the ruined friary date from later in the 14th century. It is likely that they were based in Timoleague Castle prior to the construction of the friary.

By the 15th century, the friary was recognised as a centre of learning, and also as an important ecclesiastical centre. In 1460, Timoleague became one of the first houses in the Franciscan order to recognise the observantine reform. Tadhg Mac Cárthaigh, also known as &quot;Blessed Thaddeus&quot;, is said to have been educated by the friars in Timoleague around this time. According to the Annals of Ulster, in 1505 Patrick Ó Feidhil, a famous preacher in Ireland and Scotland, was buried in the friary.

An important patron of the church was Bishop John Edmond de Courcy, along with his nephew James, 8th Baron Kingsale. They funded the construction of the Gothic style bell tower, the infirmary, the library, and one of the dormitories. De Courcy had been a friar in Timoleague before being made a bishop. The tower was added between 1510 and 1518. They also contributed to the friary&#x27;s collection of plate. John de Courcy was buried in the transept of the friary, but in the Cromwellian period his grave was desecrated and his bones thrown into the estuary.

Despite the dissolution of the monasteries in 1540 by Henry VIII, the friars remained in Timoleague. In 1568, the friary was seized by crown forces, and in 1577 was granted to James de Barry, 4th Viscount Buttevant. Despite this, Timoleague remained an important centre for the training of the novitiate until the late 1580s. In 1590, the Protestant Bishop of Cork ordered materials to be taken from the friar&#x27;s mill to be used in the construction of a new mill he was building, but the river flooded and swept away all progress on the new mill. In 1596, the friary&#x27;s wooden cells were removed and were being transported by ship, but the ship sank in a storm. After the succession of James I, the friary was reclaimed by Catholics in 1603, and was repaired in its entirety by the end of 1604. During these repairs, significant changes were made to the architecture of the friary.

=== Abandonment and destruction ===
In 1612, Bishop Lyons came to Timoleague to disperse the friars but was repelled by an Irish force led by Daniel O&#x27;Sullivan. Though the friary had reportedly been re-edified by 1613, by the time of Donatus Mooney&#x27;s visit in 1616, the friary could no longer be considered genuinely inhabited. In 1629, four years after the death of King James, Richard Boyle was named Lord Justice and instigated the closure of religious buildings across Cork, putting increasing pressure on the friary. It is assumed, however, that the friary was already largely abandoned by the Franciscans by this point, as the guardian appointed to the friary, Eugenius Fildaeus, was appointed in Limerick, . By 1631 the friary had been largely plundered by Protestant settlers.

Despite these accounts, the friary was reportedly renowned for its School of Philosophy, established in 1620 and led by Owen O&#x27;Fihelly. Furthermore, in 1629 Mícheál Ó Cléirigh reportedly transcribed material from the Book of Lismore in the friary library.

The friary was eventually burnt down by crown forces in July 1642, when a force led by Lord Kinelmeaky failed to capture Timoleague Castle and instead burnt the friary and much of the town. Franciscan houses were commonly founded at trading ports, and Timoleague is no exception: the friary at one time engaged in significant trade with France, and in particular, Spain. The monks likely traded Irish agricultural goods such as hides, butter, timber, and corn in exchange for wine: an account of the burning of the friary states that: &quot;We burnt all the towne, and their great Abbey, in which was some thousand barrels of wine.&quot; The destruction of the friary led to a significant downturn in the financial development of the town.

=== As ruins ===
After the friary was burnt, local families began to bury their dead within the friary regardless of status, something which previously had only been done for prominent local families. Despite the burning of the friary, the Franciscan community of Timoleague survived for close to two centuries. In 1696 four friars were reportedly living in the ruined monastery. Though the Franciscan community dispersed by the mid-eighteenth century, individual friars remained in the area for several more decades. The last Franciscan friar working in the area was Fr Edmund Tobin (also known as Bonaventure Tobin), who died circa 1822. The Franciscans appointed titular guardians of the friary up until 1872. The last guardian of Timoleague friary was Patrick Carey. Interest in the friary was renewed during the Romantic era of the early 19th century, and many paintings and sketches of the friary exist from this period. On 15 January 1848, Fr Matt Horgan, writing under the pen-name &quot;Viator&quot;, wrote the following which was released in the &quot;Cork Examiner:&quot;

Soon after the publication of these remarks, Colonel Robert Travers, the so-called &quot;lord of the soil&quot;, had the walls of the friary grounds replaced, and a road built between them and the sea, all at his own expense. In 1891, mass was celebrated in the friary for the first time since it was burnt down 249 years prior. One of the Timoleague chalices (the Dale-Browne Chalice) was used on the occasion. In 1892, Denham Franklin wrote that

In 1920, in response to the murder of three police officers by Irish nationalists, British soldiers desecrated the friary&#x27;s burial ground. Burial vaults were opened, and the flags that had been draped over the coffins within were torn and cast aside. Coffins were opened, and in some cases, human remains were left visible.

The friary has been listed as a discovery point on the Wild Atlantic Way since it was established in 2014. Irish-language writer Máire Ní Shíthe was interred in the friary in an unmarked grave in 1955. In 2016 the location of her burial was identified, and a commemorative stone placed above it.

== Architecture ==
The friary is the largest medieval ruin in West Cork. The use of locally available freestone was typical in the construction of Franciscan friaries of the period, and Timoleague Friary is no exception, having been made from locally sourced slate, quarried in nearby Borleigh. Built in the Early English Gothic architectural style, the architectural details are quite plain. Despite the extensive standing remains, the friary was once much larger than it is today. Records show that in the late 1500s the friary had a mill attached to the main structure, and that the monastery stood on a 4.5 acre site – four times larger than what is left of the friary grounds today.

At the entrance to the nave, now used as the main entrance to the friary, a fleur-de-lis is engraved on the left jamb. The doorway features simple mouldings, features of the Perpendicular Gothic period. The original monks were likely French-speaking, and would have used the fleur-de-lis as an aid to describing the Holy Trinity. A small recess above the door was used to hold either a sculpture or other religious imagery. The nave was considerably smaller when the friary was first constructed; it features an arcade of six arches, only three of which are original.

A leprosarium was located in Spittal, a nearby townland, and as a result, the south window of the transept was known as the &quot;Leper&#x27;s Hole&quot; or &quot;Lepers&#x27; Window&quot; — a gap through which sufferers of leprosy could see and hear the service, and partake in the Blessed Sacrament. The window is narrower on the outside than it is on the inside, and the Eucharist was likely passed out by the monks on a spoon so as to avoid contact with a disease which was considered highly contagious at the time.
The choir is the oldest part of the friary and may have originally been an early 13th-century castle or church that the Franciscans later added to. It is notably tall and features unusual components such as long arches and triforium wall passages. It features four widely splayed arched recesses in the north and south walls, separated by piers, one of which is now covered by the base of the tower. The recess nearest the east gable contained the sedilia. A niche on the northern wall once contained an altar in memory of the de Courcey family. The great window in the choir faces east, and once contained elaborate stained glass imagery. The graves of the McCarthy Reagh family are also located here.

The sacristy features a bullaun stone, commonly known as a “wart well” as the water in the depression was said to heal warts. This stone is far older than any other aspect of the friary, and may have originally been associated with the original 6th or 7th century monastic site.

One of the protruding stones on the exterior wall is known as &quot;St Molaga&#x27;s Head&quot;. A gift given by French sailors as thanksgiving for safe harbour following a storm at sea, it was originally a sculpture of Molaga&#x27;s head, but the facial features have been completely eroded.

A room generally considered to have been the library is the only section of the friary not in use as a burial ground. This may have been the place of residence of the friars who remained in Timoleague after the destruction of the friary. The windows present in the remaining ground floor of this room would not have been sufficient for literary work, and the library was actually more likely to have been on the upper floor.

When Donatus Mooney visited the friary in the 17th century, he noted that the ceilings above the refectory and the chapter room were supported by beams of carved oak. The chapter room may have at one time been the location of the library, though it was later used for storage purposes. The chamber designated as the refectory is evidenced by traces of a reader&#x27;s seat and one of the five windows which lighted it.
The friary originally had a cloister, but only a portion of its walls remain standing. It is unclear whether the ambulatory extended along the western side. The cloister and the monk&#x27;s living quarters are towards the north of the church, which is typical of Irish Franciscan friaries. The cloister quadrangle would have covered an area across by wide. In the south wall of the cloister is an intramural space known locally as &quot;The Fairy Cupboard&quot;. In the 1800s, some local children supposedly entered the Fairy Cupboard and discovered a parchment manuscript beneath one of the flagstones, which they used as a football before the remainder was eaten by pigs. Documentary evidence suggests that there was exterior access from the cloister to rooms on the upper floor, which would have been unusual. Though there are no traces of steps, there are indications that the space typically occupied by the chapter room in Franciscan friaries was used as a cellarage, and that the chapter room was located above. A further atypical feature of the friary is that alongside the cloister it has a large outdoor courtyard.

The bell tower is one of fourteen pre-reformation towers built in Franciscan monasteries that still stand today. It is a later addition to the friary, and was erected in the early 16th century. The tower is wider from north to south than from west to east, a feature typical of Franciscan towers. It measures from west to east and from north to south. Also typical is the abrupt narrowing of the cross-walls from the north and south at the point where the tower begins. The tower is more obviously battered than most Franciscan towers. The tower is battlemented, as are almost all surviving towers. The top of the tower has three merlons rising to each of its four corners.

== Historical artefacts ==

=== Book of Lismore ===

, or the Book of Lismore, also known as , is a 15th-century manuscript with connections to the friary. Though some sources claim that the manuscript was written or partly written in the friary, Professor Pádraig Ó Macháin, an expert on Irish manuscripts, says that that is not the case. It was held in the friary at times, and material from the book was transcribed there by Mícheál Ó Cléirigh in 1629.

=== Timoleague Chalices ===
Two 17th century chalices – both of which are referred to as the &quot;Timoleague Chalice&quot; – are associated with the friary. The first, also known as the &quot;Dale-Browne Chalice&quot;, or the &quot;Dale Chalice&quot;, is made of gilt silver and was created circa. 1600. After the suppression of the monastery, one of the friars supposedly escaped with the chalice, disguised himself and lived as a farmer. His dying wish was that the chalice and his vestments were buried in a box beneath his house and that they remain buried until the friary was restored and the friars had returned. Years later, the box was discovered while the house was undergoing renovations. The contents were given to Franciscans in Cork.

The earlier chalice is engraved with the words &quot;.&quot; around the base, which translates as &quot;Pray for the souls of Charles Daly and Elizabeth Browne, Timoleague&quot;. It is 8.5 inches tall, with the tulip-shaped bowl measuring 3.25 inches wide and 3 inches deep. Its primary decoration is on one facet of its tall hexagonal foot. It depicts a selection of the Instruments of the Passion: a central cross with a spear to one side and a stick with a sponge on the other. The cross is depicted as the tree of life, with branches sprouting from its tip and base and shamrocks forming its head and arms. The chalice was likely a gift from the Dalys (Elizabeth Browne being Charles&#x27; wife) to the friars upon their return to the friary after its suppression in 1568. It is currently held by the Collins Barracks branch of the National Museum of Ireland.

The later chalice, also known as the &quot;Timoleague Franciscan Chalice&quot;, is made of gold and may date to c. 1633. When the friary was burned, three friars supposedly fled via rowboat and were found at sea by fishermen from Cape Clear Island, by which time two of them had died. A box was left with the fishermen by the surviving friar, with instructions that they not open it as he would one day return for it, though he never did. It was re-opened in 1860 and found to contain a set of severely deteriorated vestments and a chalice &quot;black with age&quot;. The chalice is engraved with the words &quot;ffr&#x27;MinConv de Thimolaggi&quot; (&quot;Friars Minor Convent of Timoleague&quot;). In 1892, 250 years after the chalice was removed from the town, it was returned to the parish priest of Timoleague. It has remained in the safekeeping of his successors, and an exact replica of the chalice is on permanent display in the local Catholic church.

== In culture ==

William Ashford depicted the friary several times: first in a pencil sketch, and then again among his earliest landscape works, which include a rough drawing of the friary, titled &quot;Timoleague (abbey ruins)&quot;, which he followed with two 1776 watercolours of the ruins. The Irish writer Seán Ó Coileáin wrote the c. 1913 poem about the ruins. James Hardiman described it as one of the &quot;finest modern poems in the Irish language&quot; in 1831. It has been translated to English several times, including as &quot;The Mourner&#x27;s Soliloquy in the Ruined Abbey of Timoleague&quot; and as &quot;Lament over the Ruins of the Abbey of Teach Molaga&quot; by Sir Samuel Ferguson. A bronze cast of one of the verses in the original Irish is located at the entrance gate of the ruins.

<doc id="1231171" wikidata="Q269106" url="?curid=1231171" title="Michele Lee">
<text>Michele Lee (born June 24, 1942) is an American actress, singer, dancer, producer and director. She is known for her role as Karen Fairgate MacKenzie on the prime-time soap opera &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, for which she was nominated for a 1982 Emmy Award and won the Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Actress in 1988, 1991, and 1992. She was the only performer to appear in all 344 episodes of the series.

Lee began her career on Broadway in &quot;Vintage 60&quot; (1960) and &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; (1962). She made her movie debut in the film version of the latter in 1967. Her other film appearances include the Disney film &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1968), &quot;The Comic&quot; (1969), and &quot;Along Came Polly&quot; (2004). She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical in 1974 for &quot;Seesaw&quot; and for 
the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play in 2001 for &quot;The Tale of the Allergist&#x27;s Wife&quot;. She also played the title role in the 1998 TV film &quot;Scandalous Me: The Jacqueline Susann Story&quot; and Madame Morrible in the 2015 Broadway musical &quot;Wicked&quot;. She was a guest on the series premiere of &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot; in 1980.

==Early life==
Michele Lee Dusick was born in Los Angeles on June 24, 1942, the daughter of Sylvia Helen (née Silverstein), and Jack Dusick, a makeup artist. She attended Alexander Hamilton High School.

==Career==
===Career beginnings===
Her television career began at age 19, on the December 26, 1961, episode of the CBS-TV sitcom &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;.

After she sang in the film version of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, she became known for her roles in the films &quot;The Comic&quot;, opposite Dick Van Dyke, and &quot;The Love Bug&quot;, opposite Dean Jones, the latter becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 1969 in the United States. That same year, she starred in a special television production of the Jerome Kern–Otto Harbach musical, &quot;Roberta&quot;, in which she sang &quot;Smoke Gets In Your Eyes&quot;, and also peaked at #52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;L. David Sloane&quot;. She recorded two records on Columbia Records in the 1960s, in addition to her singing work on original Broadway cast albums. After the birth of her son, she worked infrequently until accepting a role on Broadway in &quot;Seesaw&quot;, which netted her a Tony Award nomination in 1974. After her mother&#x27;s death, she stopped working to spend time with her son.

In 1974, Lee starred in the pilot episode of the proposed CBS sitcom &quot;The Michele Lee Show&quot;. She played Michele Burton, a clerk in a hotel newsstand, with support from Stephen Collins. However, only the pilot episode was aired, and the series did not proceed. Lee became a busy guest actor in the 1970s, appearing on &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;; &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;; &quot;Night Gallery&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;; &quot;The Love Boat&quot;; and &quot;The Match Game&quot;.

===&quot;Knots Landing&quot;===
In 1979, Lee accepted the role of Karen Fairgate on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, a spin-off of the highly popular &quot;Dallas&quot;. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit and became one of the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979–1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee&#x27;s alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the &quot;First Lady of &quot;Knots Landing&quot;&quot; during her guest appearance on &quot;The Late Show&quot;, then hosted by Rivers. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying, &quot;Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn&#x27;t ashamed of that. Remember in our society...when we could go over to other people&#x27;s houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they&#x27;d walk into an unlocked door in our house.&quot; Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show&#x27;s 344 episodes. 

During the fall of 1982, her character met M. Patrick &quot;Mack&quot; MacKenzie (Kevin Dobson), who became her screen husband the following year. They would continue working together until the end of the series. Lee won the &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Award for Best Lead Actress (Primetime) three times, and was also nominated for an Emmy in 1982 for &quot;Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series&quot;. In 1983, the writer and producers of &quot;Knots Landing&quot; urged her to do a storyline based on prescription drug dependency, which became one of her most prominent storylines. Six years later, Lee directed her first of several episodes of the series. In 1991, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; reached a milestone with its 300th episode. During the same season, Lee filmed her favorite scene from the series, known as the &quot;Pollyanna Speech&quot; among fans. In this scene, for which Lee had much input, Karen reacts strongly against the social problems of 1990s society and explains how she does not want to be a Pollyanna and see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rather wanted the world to be rose-colored.

===Later career===
After &quot;Knots Landing&quot; ended in 1993, Lee appeared in many made-for-TV movies, including a biopic of late country star Dottie West (&quot;Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story&quot;). She also became the first woman to star in, direct, and produce a TV movie for Lifetime, &quot;Color Me Perfect&quot; (1996). She was also in the reunion miniseries &quot;Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac&quot; (1997), and portrayed novelist Jacqueline Susann in the television biopic &quot;Scandalous Me: The Jacqueline Susann Story&quot; (1998). In 2000, she returned to the Broadway stage in &quot;The Tale of the Allergist&#x27;s Wife&quot; and received a 2001 Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play.

In 2004, Lee returned to feature films in the role of Ben Stiller&#x27;s character&#x27;s mother in &quot;Along Came Polly&quot;. She guest-starred alongside Chita Rivera in a February 2005 episode of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. Also in 2005, she reunited with her &quot;Knots Landing&quot; co-stars for the nonfiction special &quot;Knots Landing Reunion: Together Again&quot;, in which the actors reminisced about their time on the hit series. That same year she appeared alongside Tyne Daly, Leslie Uggams, Christine Baranski and Karen Ziemba for the Kennedy Center Honor of Julie Harris. In 2010, Lee did voice work for an episode of the animated comedy series &quot;Family Guy&quot;. She returned to Broadway in 2015 to star as Madame Morrible in the musical &quot;Wicked&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1963, Lee met actor James Farentino on the set of the play &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, and in 1966, they were married. They have a son, David Farentino. Lee and Farentino divorced in 1983. She has been married to writer/producer Fred Rappaport since 1987.

<text>USS &quot;Spikefish&quot; (SS/AGSS-404), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy, named for the spikefish. She was the first United States submarine to record 10,000 dives.

==World War II Service==

&quot;Spikefish&quot; was laid down on 29 January 1944 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 26 April 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Harvey W. Moore, and commissioned on 30 June 1944.

She outfitted there until 31 July when she moved to the Portsmouth-New London area for training. The submarine departed Portsmouth on 16 September and proceeded via the Panama Canal to the Hawaiian Islands. Upon arriving at Pearl Harbor on 23 October, she began preparation for her first war patrol.

&quot;Spikefish&quot; got underway on 15 November 1944 for the Kuril Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk. She encountered no enemy shipping during the patrol which ended at Midway Island on 1 January 1945. On 26 January, she sailed for the Ryukyus and began patrolling westward of that group.

On 24 February, the submarine made a submerged attack on a convoy of six cargo ships with four escorts. She fired six torpedoes at two of the freighters, three of which were heard to hit, but results were not observed as &quot;Spikefish&quot; was forced to go deep and weather out a four-hour attack of about 80 depth charges. She sighted another convoy on 5 March and expended six torpedoes in a fruitless attack which led to another pounding by escorts. &quot;Spikefish&quot; was ordered to terminate her patrol on 6 March, and she returned to Pearl Harbor on 19 March.

One month later, &quot;Spikefish&quot;, under Cdr. Robert R. Managhan, sailed with for Guam, topped off with fuel, and proceeded independently, on 3 May, toward an area off the east coast of Formosa where she assumed lifeguard station duties. She made no rescues during this period and sighted only one enemy ship. That occurred on the night of 14 May, and all four torpedoes that she fired missed the target. On 29 May, &quot;Spikefish&quot; was ordered to take station off Sakishima Gunto and act as lifeguard for carrier planes in the area. On 5 June, she bombarded Miyara airstrip on Ishigaki Jima with her gun. Two days later, the submarine rescued a downed pilot whose plane had crashed after taking off from escort carrier, . She returned to Guam on 13 June.

&quot;Spikefish&quot; began her last war patrol on 8 July with an uneventful patrol in the Yellow Sea and lifeguard duty off Shanghai. On 24 July, she bombarded Surveyor Island, off the China coast, in an attempt to destroy an enemy radar station. Shortly after midnight on 11 August, she located a small Japanese cargo ship near her lifeguard station but could not make positive identification at night. The ship was dead in the water, so &quot;Spikefish&quot; waited until morning, identified it as enemy and sank it with gunfire. Three survivors were brought on board. On the night of 13 August about southeast of Shanghai, she made radar contact with a surfaced submarine. After tracking it for about an hour, the submarine submerged and disappeared from &quot;Spikefish&quot;&#x27;s scope. At 00:07, contact was regained and the submarine was tracked until morning, when she was sighted on the surface. Her silhouette proved her to be Japanese. &quot;Spikefish&quot; fired six torpedoes. Two hit the target, which sank in a cloud of smoke at .
The sole survivor who was taken prisoner identified the submarine as &quot;I-373&quot;; she was the last Japanese submarine sunk in the war.

==End of War==

On 15 August, an order was received to cease all attacks, as Japan had agreed to surrender. The submarine delivered her prisoners to Saipan on 21 August and proceeded to Pearl Harbor, On 6 September, she and sailed for the east coast of the United States. &quot;Spikefish&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 23 September and arrived at New London, Conn. on 29 September. She was in drydock at the Portsmouth Navy Yard from 1 November 1945 to 15 February 1946. Upon her return to New London, her home port, she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 2 and trained personnel of the submarine school.

==Post War service and fate==

Her training duty was interrupted by an overhaul from 7 April to 22 September 1947; a cruise to Bermuda from 25 September to 2 October 1947; and another overhaul at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard from 16 May to 8 July 1948. &quot;Spikefish&quot; operated from New London making training cruises along the east coast from Bermuda to Nova Scotia until 30 April 1955. On that day, she and sailed for the Mediterranean and deployment with the 6th Fleet. &quot;Spikefish&quot; returned to New London on 8 October 1955 and resumed her normal training duties until early 1963. On 18 March 1960, &quot;Spikefish&quot; became the first United States submarine to record 10,000 dives.

&quot;Spikefish&quot; was redesignated an Auxiliary Research Submarine and renumbered AGSS-404 (auxiliary, submarine) in 1962. She was decommissioned at Key West, Florida on 2 April 1963 and was stricken from the Navy list on 1 May 1963. She was subsequently sunk as a target in August 1964 off Long Island, New York.

&quot;Spikefish&quot; received three battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="1231178" wikidata="Q861977" url="?curid=1231178" title="Bill Brown (footballer, born 1931)">
<text>William Dallas Fyfe Brown (8 October 1931 – 30 November 2004) was a Scottish football goalkeeper.

Brown played for Dundee between 1949 and 1959, and for Tottenham Hotspur between 1959 and 1966. He was part of the Spurs team that won the Double of Football League and FA Cup in 1961 - the first club to achieve the feat in the 20th century. He was also capped 28 times for the Scotland national team.

==Career==
===Dundee===

Brown played as a youth for Carnoustie Panmure. He started his senior career with Dundee as a teenager and made over 200 appearances in the Scottish Football League.

===Tottenham Hotspur===

Brown was signed in 1959 for £16,500 to Tottenham Hotspur in June 1959. He was at White Hart Lane for seven years, winning the Double in 1961 missing only one game the entire season. He also helped the team win the FA Cup again in 1962,and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1963. He produced one of his best performances in the match against Bratislava in quarter-final of 1962–63 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

He suffered injuries in the mid-1960s, and with the arrival of Pat Jennings to the team, he began to lose his place in the starting lineup. He played his last game for the club in a friendly in October 1966, and transferred to Northampton Town the same month.

===Northampton and Toronto Falcons===

He next had a spell at Northampton Town. Brown then moved to Canada to end his playing days with the Toronto Falcons during the 1967 National Professional Soccer League season.

===International===
Brown was capped 28 times for Scotland and played in the 1958 World Cup. He also played for his country at &#x27;B&#x27; team, youth and schoolboy level. Brown also represented the Scottish League XI while he was with Dundee.

==After playing==
After he finished playing, he stayed in Canada and worked as a property developer and for the government. He died in 2004, aged 73. The news broke just before Tottenham played a League Cup tie against Liverpool and, as a tribute, they wore black armbands for the occasion.

<text>Up in Town is a six-part series of short (10-minute) monologues, featuring Joanna Lumley as the middle-aged, divorced and lonely Madison Blakelock. The series was produced for television by Baby Cow Productions, and screened on BBC Two. It has subsequently been released on DVD.

==Summary==
Madison Blakelock is delighted to be living her &#x27;new life&#x27;, since her executive class husband, who works &#x27;up in town&#x27;, and she parted company 18 years before. And now she has nothing more to do but sit before her mirror, picking over the bones of her past with an optimism and energy dizzyingly at odds with her reality. As the unrecognised failures of her life mount up, the loss of love, friends, money, purpose and her beloved cat, the cracks in her terrifyingly maintained facade begin to show.

==Critical reception==
The series received a positive reception from critics. &quot;The Times&quot; praised Lumley and her &quot;rich, darkly comic and beautifully observed performance&quot;.&quot;The Guardian&quot; cited that the series deserved better scheduling.

The series has also been compared to Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Talking Heads&quot; series of monologues.

<doc id="1231194" wikidata="Q2062203" url="?curid=1231194" title="Tyrone Marshall">
<text>Tyrone Everton Marshall (born 12 November 1974) is a retired Jamaican footballer and current head coach of FC Cincinnati 2, the reserve team of Major League Soccer&#x27;s FC Cincinnati.

==Career==

===Youth and College===
Marshall moved to the Fort Lauderdale, Florida area when he was twelve years old. He attended Lindsey Wilson College from 1994 to 1995 before transferring to Florida International University where he played on the men&#x27;s soccer team from 1996 to 1997.

===Professional===

====Colorado Rapids====
Marshall was drafted by Colorado Rapids with the 11th overall pick of the 1998 MLS College Draft. He played only one game for Colorado, then was dealt, along with Jason Boyce, to Miami Fusion on 14 August 1998 in exchange for David Vaudreuil.

====Miami Fusion and LA Galaxy====
Marshall would spend the next three and a half seasons in Miami, starting as a forward and eventually drifting to the midfield and then defense. After the Fusion folded following the 2001 season, Marshall was selected by Los Angeles Galaxy as the ninth pick of the 2002 MLS Allocation Draft and helped LA to victory in MLS Cup 2002.

On 13 June 2007, Marshall received a red card for a tackle which broke the leg of FC Dallas forward Kenny Cooper in the 89th minute. The red card carries a mandatory one-game suspension and $250 fine, but the MLS Disciplinary Committee decided unanimously to extend the suspension two additional games and an additional fine of $1,250.

====Toronto FC====
Marshall was traded to Toronto FC for Edson Buddle on 13 June 2007 after five seasons with the Galaxy. Marshall cemented his place in Toronto&#x27;s defense, and went on to make 16 starts during the 2007 season. Marshall managed to get revenge on his former side when Toronto earned their first win of the 2008 season in Los Angeles.
====Seattle Sounders FC====
Marshall was traded to Seattle Sounders FC on 10 February 2009 for allocation money. He scored his first goal for the Sounders against Chicago Fire as the game finished 1–1. He also assisted a goal by Steve Zakuani in a match against San Jose. However, in the 86th minute in a match against D.C. United, Marshall accidentally scored an own goal with his head, and the game finished 3–3. He scored his second goal for the club on 17 October, in a game against Kansas City Wizards.

====Return to the Colorado Rapids====
After the 2010 MLS season Seattle declined Marshall&#x27;s contract option and Marshall elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On 15 December 2010 Marshall was selected by Colorado Rapids in Stage 2 of the Re-Entry draft. Marshall agreed to the terms of his contract on 3 January 2011 officially completing the transfer.

Marshall was released by Colorado on 16 November 2012. He entered the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft and became a free agent after going undrafted in both rounds of the draft.

===International===
Marshall was a regular with the Jamaica national team. He appeared in 83 matches from 2000 to 2010 before retiring from international football in January 2010, after appearing versus Canada.

==Management==

Marshall was named head coach of the River City Rovers of the USL Premier Development League for the 2014 season. In 2015 Marshall was named an assistant coach for Real Salt Lake. Marshall continued as an assistant coach when head coach Jeff Cassar was fired and replaced by Mike Petke, and again in 2019 when Petke was fired and replaced with Freddy Juarez.

He joined FC Cincinnati in February 2021 to coach their under-19 academy team and future under-23 squad. On September 27, 2021, Marshall was named interim head coach of FC Cincinnati&#x27;s senior team for the remainder of the 2021 season following the dismissal of Jaap Stam. On February 22, 2022, FC Cincinnati announced that Marshall will be the first head coach of the team&#x27;s MLS Next Pro reserve team, FC Cincinnati 2.

<text>The Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros is a cultural, political and social facility located in Mexico City as part of the World Trade Center Mexico City. It was designed and decorated by David Alfaro Siqueiros in the 1960s and hosts the largest mural work in the world called La Marcha de la Humanidad. The building has a theatre, galleries and more, but the main focus is the Forum Universal, which contains the interior portion of Siqueiros&#x27; mural work. Visitors can experience the mural while standing on a rotating stage, listening to Siqueiros narrate.

==Site==

The Polyforum is a decagon shaped construction with different exhibition spaces that feature David Alfaro Siqueiros’ work. The building is part of a business complex called the World Trade Center Mexico City in the Benito Juárez borough of Mexico City. This complex was designed by architects Joaquín Alvarez, Guillermo Rossel de la Lama and Ramón Mikelajáuregui, and built just outside Parque de la Lama, but the Polyforum was designed and decorated by Siqueiros, who nicknamed it “El coronelazo.” The exterior is in the form of a diamond and the inside has eight sides. The building with its murals is considered to be an “artistic heritage site” for Mexico, registered by the Centro Nacional de Conservación, Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura and Registro del Patrimonio Artístico Mueble. The Polyforum is a multiple event facility dedicated to cultural, political and social events. Its main aspects include a 500-seat theatre, two galleries, offices and the Foro Universal or Universal Forum.

The outside wall was built in 1970 as a way for patron Manuel Suárez to prevent encroachment or destruction of his property. The wall became immediately controversial because although it was built for safety purposes, it obstructed the view of the Polyforum for passersby, thus making it less accessible to the general public. The press allegedly deemed the wall defensive and antisocial, and Siqueiros tried to defend the wall by saying that it was merely an aesthetic extension of the Polyforum itself. Made into a work of art, the inner surface of the wall celebrates the fiftieth anniversary of the Mexican mural movement of which Siqueiros actively participated in with Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and others. The mural prominently features portraits of Rivera and Orozco, as well as Dr. Atl, a key figure in the start of the mural movement, and graphic artists Guadalupe Posada and Leopoldo Mendez.

The Polyforum&#x27;s exterior, a 2,750 ft. area, features a twelve-faced sculptural mural painting. Each face depicts a different symbolic concept. The twelve concepts depicted are: Destiny, Ecology, Acrobats, Masses, Decalog, Christ, Indigenous Peoples, Dance, Mythology, Mingling of Races, Music, and Atom. The exterior work is meant to serve as a preview of the interior mural, to entice visitors to enter the building, and to make visitors contemplate the complex meanings of the concepts represented.

==Political climate==
The year 1960 marked the fiftieth year of the Mexican Revolution, and the political situation in Mexico during the 1960s was quite grim. The early 1960s was marked by major control by the Left and attempts to create class equality, but these attempts unfortunately failed. In 1964, the combination of both an economic decline and an announcement that allottable land was near exhaustion led many peasants to revolt. In the late 1960s, the Right gained control, which led to many doctor and student strikes that were received with strong resistance from the government. The most shocking example of the murky political situation in 1960s Mexico happened in the form of the Tlatelolco Massacre on October 2, 1968. During a student demonstration that happened ten days before the Summer Olympics in Mexico City, police and military officers shot into a crowd of unarmed students at Tlatelolco Plaza. The final death toll remains a mystery, but it has been reported that four students died, twenty were wounded, and thousands were beaten, jailed, and disappeared. This event coincided with the intended opening of the Polyforum Cultural Siqueiros during the summer of 1968, and demonstrates how turbulent the political climate was in Mexico during the Polyforum&#x27;s construction.

==Mexico 2000==
The Polyforum was designed as part of a major redevelopment/improvement project for Mexico City entitled Mexico 2000. Because of an increase in Mexico City&#x27;s urban population, Mexico 2000 strived to generate income for the city through tourism and services at its decentralized location at Parque de la Lama. In addition to making arts more accessible to people through Siqueiros’ work at the Polyforum, some of the other contributions of Mexico 2000 included underground networks of driveways, closed circuit radio and television broadcasting, a new system of construction called “Tridilosa” that lightened the weight of the building structure as to allow for more rooms to be created, and expedited travel services for tourists coming into the city.
&lt;br&gt;The plaza&#x27;s major hotel, “El Hotel de Mexico,” is 730 foot high building that was designed to house a large number of tourists. At the time, the hotel was the tallest reinforced concrete and earthquake-resistant building in the world, and featured 1,512 rooms and suites with a variety of dining options. Equally important to tourism as the Polyforum, “El Hotel de Mexico” was built for both functionality and aesthetic pleasure through its architectural grandeur.

==The commission==
Although the date is rather uncertain, most agree that the initial commission of the Polyforum happened in 1960 before the radical artist Siqueiros was imprisoned for the charges of attacking police, resisting arrest, firing an illegal weapon, and inciting violence. Siqueiros officially accepted the commission from art patron and industrialist Manuel Suárez on September 7, 1964. The first request of Suárez was for a large mural to be housed in Cuernavaca. The location of the mural was then moved to Mexico City in 1966, and now is known as &quot;The March of Humanity&quot;. The location change to Parque de la Lama was part of Suárez&#x27;s larger ideas to both draw people away from the urban center and to promote tourism in an effort to boost the suffering Mexican economy.

Creating the Polyforum was a collective act, and required a large team of workers. Several architects, engineers, painters, sculptors, and acoustics experts from all around the world came to work on the massive project.
The undertaking was so large that Siqueiros purchased an additional piece of land next to his home and studio in Cuernavaca for his team to complete the project. All of the panels for &quot;The March of Humanity&quot; were created in Cuernavaca, where Rhode Island School of Design alumni Mark Rogovin worked under Siqueiros. Rogovin attests to the fact that he and a friend were the only U.S. natives to be working on the project, as most of the other members were from Japan, Italy, Argentina, and various other locations around the world. According to Rogovin, Siqueiros was constantly at the studio, putting in long days and making sure that the project was being carried out to his standard. The project was initially to be completed for the 1968 Olympic Games, but due to political and financial complications, the Polyforum was not finished and inaugurated until December 15, 1971.

==Forum Universal==

The main feature of the complex at Parque de la Lama is the Forum Universal, which contains Siquieros’ mural called &quot;La Marcha de la Humanidad&quot; (&quot;The March of Humanity&quot;). The building, which contains four floors and has an area of 134,000 square feet, also contains a theatre, two joined galleries and other facilities. Siqueiros’ mural covers the dome on the top floor, and up to one thousand spectators can stand on the rotating platform beneath the mural. Accompanying the viewing experience, a light and sound program that was designed by Manuel Suárez y Suárez plays to educate the viewers about the mural. The next floor down features a space for local and international art exhibitions. Below this floor is a theater that features various performances, as well as a small shopping area called the Universal Forum Emerging Art Space (EAE). The basement of the Polyforum is an open space that can be used for storage as well as exhibitions.

In 2011, for the 40th anniversary of the structure, the Forum&#x27;s two art galleries named after Dr. Atl and Mario Orozco Rivera were renovated and merged into one gallery, measuring over 300 square meters. The first served as the site museum with a space of 145 meters squared. Its permanent exhibition consisted of photographs and models and sketches related to the painting of the site&#x27;s mural. It also contained biographical information in the form of documents and photographs of Manuel Suárez y Suárez, the sponsor of the Polyforum along with that of Siqueiros. The gallery contains a statue of Manuel Suárez y Suárez. The second gallery dedicated to Orozco Rivera measured 169 meters squared and is shows mainly temporary exhibits of painting, sculpture and photography. The new gallery&#x27;s first exhibition of 2011 was called “My Trend Week,&quot; and it was designed to display the works of new artistic talent in architecture as well as graphic, industrial and interior design. The combined space has been tentatively renamed “Espacio de Arte Emergente” (Emerging Art Space) .

==&quot;La Marcha de la Humanidad&quot; (&quot;The March of Humanity&quot;)==
Inside the Polyforum hosts Siqueiros’ largest mural ever to be created, which is fully titled, The March of Humanity on Earth and Toward the Cosmos: Misery and Science. Including the exterior panels, the mural measures 8,700 square meters. Siqueiros described the theme as “Naked people close to the soil, a woman with a child on her lap, and smaller children raising their arms begging for bread. They are hungry, the oldest, doubled over under a bundle of firewood, walks off in search of a livelihood; groups of women running pell-mell knock each other to get a crumb of bread thrown away by others---an unending struggle to solve the basic problem of existence.” The overall theme of the mural is humanity&#x27;s endless struggle throughout history and the search for a better society. The mural is divided into four main sections: &quot;The March of Humanity Towards Bourgeois Democratic Revolution&quot;; &quot;The March of Humanity to the Revolution of the Future&quot;; &quot;Peace, Culture, and Harmony&quot;; and &quot;Science and Technology&quot;.

===Section One: South Wall: &quot;The March of Humanity Towards Bourgeois Democratic Revolution&quot;===

This section of the mural depicts a revolution before a time of democratic revolution and is characterized by violence and confusion. There are many figures and forms in different positions, suggesting overall chaos. In the center, demagoguery emerges in the form of a clown who is flanked by militaristic figures. Ninety-some figures are pictured in this scene and are compositionally stacked rather than overlapped. The upper register tells a story that begins with two dark-skinned, half-naked men shown with their knees bent. Next to them, two mothers and their several children walking through a barren landscape that features one large, tree-like form in the background. The next figure is an old man who is bent down under a pile of sticks. Next to him is a group of women huddling together who are shown covering their children with shawls. This entire group is shown to be moving toward a white-faced, dancing figure with his arms raised. This figure, who appears as a leader of some sort, is flanked by a group of people who are also raising their arms. The lower register features figures that are larger in scale than those in the upper register. The first form is an abstract, humanoid form that is more difficult to recognize than the figures from the upper register. Following him is a brutalized, black male figure who is shown armless and hanged, swinging from a noose. The next figures are two large, monstrous figures with recognizably human anatomy that are followed by a larger group of marchers that are shown in uniform, carrying spears and rifles. This procession of synchronized marchers closes out the frame.

===Section Two: North Wall: &quot;The March of Humanity to the Revolution of the Future&quot;===

This section depicts the future as a chaotic and confusing time, and begins with a woman being attacked by a ferocious anthropomorphic beast. Next to the woman, a man chops down a poisonous tree, and across from him, two frightened women scurry across the turbulent landscape. Above these figures is a three-dimensional figure that protrudes from the wall and is representative of metamorphosis. The next scene depicts a large grouping of women next to a large amate tree, which is representative of the new leaders who will aid the development of humanity. Two figures come out of the tree, and seem to be flying into space. In the final scene, a gender ambiguous figure, shown sitting on a rock, points back to the tree to emphasize its importance. The landscape of Section 2 is much more rough and jagged than the landscape in Section 1, suggesting that the future revolution will be a great challenge for humanity to overcome.

===Sections Three and Four: East and West Sides: &quot;Peace, Culture, and Harmony&quot;===

This section shows a man offering industrialization to the west, and on the east side, a woman offering culture to humanize society. Converging lines that come out from the wall behind the figures unify the hands of the man and woman. The man in this scene is the leader who emerged from the amate tree in Section 2, and his return with the female suggests that he has successfully mated and created a new race. These two figures have brought the tools necessary to save humanity through starting a new march towards a better future. .

==Siqueiros Foundation of the Arts==
The Polyforum is a private institution which is supported through its activities and through private donations to the Siqueiros Foundation. The Siqueiros Foundation is run by Siqueiros&#x27; niece Anna Siqueiros, based in Los Angeles, and its mission is &quot;Bringing Color into a Concrete World.&quot; As a memorial to the deceased David Alfaro Siqueiros, the Siqueiros Foundation strives to empower underprivileged children by providing them with materials and locations to artistically express themselves. In addition, the Siqueiros Foundation preserves a collection of periodicals, audio, video and photography related to the artist, whose digitalization was begun in 2010. This collection consists of 102,908 documents and images with elements such as correspondence with contemporary intellectuals, writers and politicians, including that from the Siquieros was incarcerated in Lecumberri from 1960 to 1964. It also includes 7,000 postcards from Germany alone, and 10,000 photographs of family and 80,000 texts written about the artist.

==History==
Over its first forty years, the building suffered significant deterioration to its structure and its murals. The deterioration of the mural work is due to environmental factors and the materials Siquieros used to create the piece. In 2011, remodeling work was begun on the facility to mark its fortieth anniversary. Some restoration work had been performed in 2011, but lack of funds has prevented completion.

<text>Fújì is a genre of Yoruba popular music that emerged in Nigeria in the 1960s. It evolved from the improvisational wéré music also known as ajísari (meaning &quot;waking up for sari&quot;, performed to awaken Muslims before dawn during the fasting season of Ramadan. Fuji music was named after the Japanese stratovolcano-mountain, Mount Fuji by Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister (pioneer of wéré). It features energetic beats, diverse Yoruba rhythms, and call-and-response vocals. Fuji&#x27;s influence extends into contemporary music, with its hooks and rhythms frequently appearing in Nigerian hip hop. 

In February 2024, professor and filmmaker Saheed Aderinto released the first episode of The Fuji Documentary titled &quot;Mr. Fuji: Barry Wonder&quot; which chronicles the story of Fuji music creator Sikiru Ayinde Barrister. 

== Etymology ==
Sikiru Ololade Ayinde Balogun Barrister significantly popularized wéré music during the 1950s and 1960s and later coined the term &quot;fuji&quot; for his new innovation (fuji music) in an intriguingly unconventional manner. According to Barrister, &quot;I came up with it when I saw a poster at an airport, advertising the Mount Fuji, which is the highest peak in Japan.&quot; Fújì should not be mistaken for the Yorùbá words &quot;fúja&quot; (to flee) or &quot;fáájì&quot; (enjoyment or leisure).

==History==
Wéré music is an Islamic-influenced Yorùbá genre of music invented by Muslim singers and musicians in Yorùbá towns and cities in southwestern Nigeria to awaken Muslims fasting during Ramadan. 

Toward the end of the colonial period during the 1950s, Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister, General Ayinla Kollington, Tunde King, Ayinla Omowura, Alhaji Kola Adegoke, Alhaji Kamoru Ayinde, Alhaji Salami Ayinde, Alhaji Dauda Epo-Akara and Ganiyu Kuti (Gani Irefin) founded and popularized wéré. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, numerous wéré performance groups emerged within Muslim communities in and around the cities of Ibadan, Lagos, and Ìlọrin. These early performers drew great inspiration from Yoruba sákárà music, featuring the sákárà drum (without the violin-like goje often played with an accompanying fiddle). Notable Lagos-based wéré performers during the early independence years include Sikiru Omo Abiba, Ajadi Ganiyu, Ayinde Muniru Mayegun (General Captain), Ajadi Bashiru, Sikiru Onishemo, Kawu Aminu, Jibowu Barrister, Ayinde Fatayi, Kasali Alani, Saka Olayigbade, Ayinla Yekinni, and Bashiru Abinuwaye.

As various styles evolved, some performers played mouth organs (harmonicas) between wéré interludes within their compositions. Sikiru Ayinde Barrister was the lead singer and composer of the popular wéré group, Jibowu Barrister, under the leadership of Alhaji Jibowu Barrister. During the 1960s, Sikiru Ayinde Barrister, Kollington Ayinla and other young wéré groups rocked Lagos and its environs.

The advancement from wéré music to fuji music marked a profound transformation within Yoruba musical traditions. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister (fuji music pioneer) began to innovate on the foundational elements of wéré music by integrating influences from diverse genres such as apala, juju and afrobeat, resulting in the introduction of a modernized approach to both instrumentation and performance. The amalgamation of traditional and contemporary elements gave rise to fuji music. Popularizers of wéré music, who played a pivotal role in its early development, adapted their musical practices to foster and popularize fuji music, effectively bridging traditional Yoruba sounds with a contemporary audience.

In one of Barrister&#x27;s early albums, chiding and educating critics who dubbed fújì a &quot;local music,&quot; Sikiru Ayinde Barrister described fújì music as a combination of music consisting of sákárà, Apala, jùjú, Aró, Afrobeat, gudugudu, and some elements of highlife. Sikiru Ayinde Barrister played a significant role in popularizing fújì music by introducing it to international audiences. In the 1970s, he began touring across Europe, with a notable presence in England, and continued to the United States throughout the 1980s.

Between 1970 and throughout the 1980s, other fújì musicians included Fatai Adio, Saura Alhaji, Student Fuji, Rahimi Ayinde (Bokote), Ramoni Akanni, Love Azeez, Waidi Akangbe, Sikiru Olawoyin, Agbada Owo, Iyanda Sawaba, Ejire Shadua, Wahabi Ilori, Wasiu Ayinde Marshall, Suleiman Adigun, Sakaniyau Ejire, and Wasiu Ayinla. 

While male musicians dominated fuji, reflecting fuji&quot;’&quot;s origins in wéré music, women artists developed Islamic and interchangeably wákà fuji. Islamic is a popular name for the genre of women’s fújì-related music, particularly in and around the city of Ìlọrin, while wákà is a more general pan-Yoruba term for the Muslim women’s genre. It emerged in the late 1950s and was originally performed by women vocalists for Islamic events such as weddings and celebrations for pilgrims returning from Mecca. In the 1980s, professional Muslim women vocalists fronted their own fújì bands. While the themes and aesthetics of Islamic were more closely related to Muslim morality than fújì, there was a significant overlap between wákà fuji and traditional fújì. 

In the early 1970s, Alhaji Kolington Ayinla (Baba Alatika) emerged as a prominent fuji performer and rival to Sikiru Ayinde Barrister. Wasiu Ayinde Marshall (K1 De Ultimate), who had been a protégé of Barrister, began to gain recognition in the late 1980s and 1990s with Talazo Fuji. Adewale Ayuba, introduced Bonsue Fuji which resonated with a wide audience. Abass Akande Obesere integrated slang into his fuji songs which contributed to the genre&#x27;s evolution.

=== 2000s: Modernization ===
Throughout the 2000s, the fuji music scene continued to thrive with prominent artists including Wasiu Alabi Pasuma, King Saheed Osupa, Shanko Rasheed, and others. While most traditional fuji music songs&#x27; lyrics remained in Yorùbá, the genre had increasingly incorporated English and Nigerian Pidgin. Popular modern fújì musicians in the 2000s included Rasheed Ayinde Adekunle Merenge, Abass Akande obesere (PK 1), Sir Shina Akanni, Alhaji Isiaka Iyanda Sawaba, Adewale Ayuba, Wasiu Alabi, (Oganla 1) King Dr.Saheed Osupa (His Majesty), Late Sunny T Adesokan (Omo Ina ton ko fújì), Alayeluwa Sulaimon Alao Adekunle Malaika (KS1, Original), Shefiu Adekunle Alao (Omo Oko), Sule Adio (Atawéwé), Tajudeen Alabi Istijabah (Oju Kwara), Wasiu Ajani (Mr. Pure Water), Taiye Currency, Alhaji Komi Jackson, Remi Aluko (Igwe fújì), Muri Alabi Thunder, Karube Aloma, Oyama Azeez (Arabesa, Alapatinrin, The Modern Real Fuji Creator), Murphy Adisa Sabaika (Madiba 2), Abiodun Ike Minister (Aremo Alayeluwa), Tunde Ileiru, Karubey Shimiu, Adeolu Akanni (Paso Egba), Shamu Nokia, (Quintessential) Sunny Melody, Olusegun Ologo, Segun Michael, Bola Abimbola, and Sulaimon Alao Adekunle (KS1 Malaika), Shanko Rasheed, Wasiu Container, Cripsymixtee, Konkolo Wally G, Global T, Muri Ikoko, King Wasiu Ayinde Marshal (KWAM 1), Abass Akande Obesere, Wasiu Alabi Pasuma (commonly known as Oga Nla fuji), and King Saheed Osupa (Oba Nla fuji).

== Characteristics ==
Fújì is defined by its use of a diverse array of traditional Yoruba percussion instruments and its lively, energetic tempos. The genre features complex rhythms created by instruments like the dùndún and gbedu, which contributes to its distinctive and intricate rhythmic patterns. Additionally, fújì utilizes a call-and-response vocal style, where the lead singer&#x27;s phrases are answered by backing vocalists, creating an interactive musical dialogue. The blend of rhythmic complexity, upbeat tempo, and vocal interplay defines fuji music.

== Modern fújì musical styles ==

=== Classical fuji ===
Classical fuji is a genre that merges American hip hop with fuji. The fusion of fuji and American hip hop began in Nigeria during the 1990s and early 2000s. King Wasiu Ayinde Marshal coined the term, classical fuji and played a pivotal role in its development. Another prominent artist in the genre is Wasiu Alabi Pasuma.

=== Street pop: Neo-fuji, fujipiano and fuji-fusion ===
Street pop, also referred to as street hop, is a Nigerian experimental rap and vocal performance genre that evolved from Nigerian hip hop, Nigerian street music, popular music, Western music genres and Nigerian pop. Emerging in the 21st century, the genre draws on elements of fuji music additionally fuji-centered variants exist, including neo fuji, fujipiano and fuji-fusion. The fuji-fusion, fujipiano and neo-fuji musical styles are attributed to 9ice, Lord of Ajasa, Olamide, Asake, King Saheed Osupa, Naira Marley, Qdot and Seyi Vibez.

<doc id="1231202" wikidata="Q1715700" url="?curid=1231202" title="Jùjú music">
<text>Jùjú is a style of Yoruba popular music, derived from traditional Yoruba percussion. The name juju from the Yoruba word &quot;juju&quot; or &quot;jiju&quot; meaning &quot;throwing&quot; or &quot;something being thrown&quot;. Juju music did not derive its name from juju, which is a form of magic and the use of magic objects, common in West Africa, Haiti, Cuba and other Caribbean and South American nations. It evolved in the 1900s in urban clubs across the countries, and was believed to have been created by Ababababaa Babatunde King, popularly known as Tunde King. The first jùjú recordings were by King and Ojoge Daniel in the 1920s, when King pioneered it. The lead and predominant instrument of jùjú is the &quot;gagan&quot;, talking drum. Although jùjú music was in its early development in the 1920s, the jùjú music genre did not emerge until the mid-1930s.

Some juju musicians were itinerant, including early pioneers Ojoge Daniel, Irewole Denge and the &quot;blind minstrel&quot; Kokoro.

Afro-juju is a style of Nigerian popular music, a mixture of jùjú music and Afrobeat. Its most famous exponent was Shina Peters, who was so popular that the press called the phenomenon &quot;Shinamania&quot;. Afro-juju&#x27;s peak of popularity came in the early 1990s.

==History==
Following World War II, electric instruments began to be included, and pioneering musicians like Earnest Olatunde Thomas (Tunde Nightingale), Fatai Rolling Dollar, I. K. Dairo, Dele Ojo, Ayinde Bakare, Adeolu Akinsanya, King Sunny Adé., and Ebenezer Obey made the genre the most popular in Nigeria, incorporating new influences like funk, reggae and Afrobeat and creating new subgenres like yo-pop. Some new generation juju artistes include Oludare Olateju also known as Ludare, the son of Sabada juju music creator; Emperor Wale Olateju and Bola Abimbola. Although juju music, like apala, sakara, fuji and waka was created by Muslim Yoruba, the music itself remains secular. King Sunny Adé was the first to include the pedal steel guitar, which had previously been used only in Hawaiian music and American country music.

==Performance venue==
Jùjú music is performed primarily by artists from the southwestern region of Nigeria, where the Yoruba are the most numerous ethnic group. In performance, audience members commonly shower jùjú musicians with paper money; this tradition is known as &quot;spraying&quot;. Shina Peters was awarded in 1990, but he was panned by music critics.

Music researcher Christpher Alan Waterman said that one of the centers of the performance of jùjú music is in Ibadan. Most jùjú musicians are based in the zone of market forces. There are several contexts in which jùjú music is performed. Music was performed at hotels, nightclub, and university. The Hotels serve music halls and dance halls also. Most activity takes place after nine p.m., and the hotels are the center of Ibadan&#x27;s economic structure.

Another context in which jùjú music is played is at celebrations called àríyá. King Sunny Adé performed at àríyá with his socio aesthetics. These celebrations are parties which celebrate the naming of a baby, weddings, birthdays, funerals, title-taking, ceremonies and the launching of new property or business enterprises. Live music is crucial to the proper functioning of an àríyá.

<text>In mathematical physics, [[Constructive proof|constructive]] quantum field theory is the field devoted to showing that quantum field theory can be defined in terms of precise mathematical structures. This demonstration requires new mathematics, in a sense analogous to classical real analysis, putting calculus on a mathematically rigorous foundation. Weak, strong, and electromagnetic forces of nature are believed to have their natural description in terms of quantum fields.

Attempts to put quantum field theory on a basis of completely defined concepts have involved most branches of mathematics, including functional analysis, differential equations, probability theory, representation theory, geometry, and topology. It is known that a &quot;quantum field&quot; is inherently hard to handle using conventional mathematical techniques like explicit estimates. This is because a quantum field has the general nature of an operator-valued distribution, a type of object from mathematical analysis. The existence theorems for quantum fields can be expected to be very difficult to find, if indeed they are possible at all. 

One discovery of the theory that can be related in non-technical terms, is that the dimension &quot;d&quot; of the spacetime involved is crucial. Notable work in the field by James Glimm and Arthur Jaffe showed that with &quot;d&quot; &lt; 4 many examples can be found. Along with work of their students, coworkers, and others, constructive field theory resulted in a mathematical foundation and exact interpretation to what previously was only a set of recipes, also in the case &quot;d&quot; &lt; 4. 

Theoretical physicists had given these rules the name &quot;renormalization,&quot; but most physicists had been skeptical about whether they could be turned into a mathematical theory. Today one of the most important open problems, both in theoretical physics and in mathematics, is to establish similar results for gauge theory in the realistic case &quot;d&quot; = 4.

The traditional basis of constructive quantum field theory is the set of Wightman axioms. Konrad Osterwalder and Robert Schrader showed that there is an equivalent problem in mathematical probability theory. The examples with &quot;d&quot; &lt; 4 satisfy the Wightman axioms as well as the Osterwalder–Schrader axioms . They also fall in the related framework introduced by Rudolf Haag and Daniel Kastler, called algebraic quantum field theory. There is a firm belief in the physics community that the gauge theory of C.N. Yang and Robert Mills (the Yang–Mills theory) can lead to a tractable theory, but new ideas and new methods will be required to actually establish this, and this could take many years.

<text>The Steeple Grange Light Railway is a narrow-gauge heritage railway visitor attraction near Wirksworth in Derbyshire, England. Opened in 1985 on the trackbed of a disused branch line, it uses industrial locomotives and rolling stock from disused mines, quarries, and steelworks around the country.

==Line==
The Steeple Grange Light Railway is a gauge narrow gauge line running from outside Wirksworth to Middleton in Derbyshire, built in 1985 on trackbed of the former Killer&#x27;s Branch line of the Cromford and High Peak Railway and with a branch line subsequently added. 

A pathway leads from Main Street in Middleton to the station. A carriage and wagon shed at Dark Lane houses the railway&#x27;s coaching stock, maintenance wagons, and locomotives under maintenance. Middleton station was reached in 2019. The level crossing up from Lawson&#x27;s Loop is operated by the guard from the passing train, raising flags at a 90-degree angle with the red flag straight out to warn oncoming vehicles and the yellow flag above the guard&#x27;s head to allow the train to pass by safely.The line features a steep 1:27 (3.7 %) gradient incline. 

==Locomotives==
 the railway has 20 locomotives.

===&quot;Greenbat&quot;===

The railway&#x27;s main locomotive is &quot;Greenbat&quot;, a , &quot;trammer&quot; type battery locomotive built by Greenwood and Batley of Leeds. &quot;Greenbat&quot; incorporated a folding cab, to allow the locomotive to fit down small mineshafts. It was ordered by Halesowen Steel Co, who specifically requested the cab be fixed. &quot;Greenbat&quot; has never been underground, working in various steel mills.

&quot;Greenbat&quot; was preserved by Adrian Booth, who passed it on to the SGLR when the line was in its infancy. It was fitted with air braking, and coupled to an ex-NCB manrider has provided nearly 15 years of service. In 2005 it received new batteries, the old ones having last 15 years out of a lifespan of 10. &quot;Greenbat&quot; is the primary use locomotive at the railway, being used for normal day trips, private parties and Santa Specials (banked by ZM32 &quot;Horwich&quot; on these days).

Motor: 1× GB type T2
Drive: worm and wheel to each axle
Voltage: 48 V, Lead acid batteries

===ZM32 &quot;Horwich&quot;===

ZM32 &quot;Horwich&quot; was built in 1957 and was given the works number of 416214. This locomotive is the only gauge Ruston and Hornsby LAT in existence. It was bought by British Railways to work at their Horwich works in Lancashire, and was preserved alongside &quot;Wren&quot; at the National Railway Museum. It was initially being sent to a banana plantation in South America; however, it was abandoned in Liverpool docks until bought for the Gloddfa Ganol museum in Wales. Here, it was regauged to and restored to working order. When Gloddfa Ganol closed, it was bought by an SGLR member, restored to gauge and fitted with airbraking.

A gearbox failure led to it being taken to Dorothea Restorations for a complete overhaul. &quot;Horwich&quot; is now back on the line, painted in BR green and used alternately with &quot;Greenbat&quot;. It was recently voted the most popular non-steam narrow-gauge locomotive. This locomotive is regularly used a banker to help locomotive &quot;Greenbat&quot; up the line to Santa&#x27;s Grotto on Santa Special weekends in December.

Engine: Ruston and Hornsby diesel
Transmission: Hydraulic, 2 gear box

===&quot;Hudson&quot;===
This locomotive is unusual, being home built. The SGLR was originally started with stock from Ladywash Mine, near Eyam in Derbyshire. The only locomotive was &quot;No.6&quot;, which was in a very poor condition. Before &quot;Greenbat&quot; arrived, it was decided that one of the four-wheel Ladywash Hudson manriders should be converted to a locomotive. This was done by Alwyn Ambrey in 1988, using a Villiers engine and transmission from a cricket pitch roller. It was able to seat two passengers and the driver, but the drive was geared too highly for the engine to cope with the gradient on the line. This and the engine being in poor state meant it was used very little. 

The locomotive was worked on by various people in the late 1990s, finally being finished by J Scott in 2003. Scott refurbished the engine, thus largely solving the underpowering problem, and fitted a much better braking system. Two years later, a new engine was found. It is functionally the same as the old one, but has a 3:1 reduction gearbox fitted. Although not a complete fix, this addition has greatly improved its haulage capacity. The locomotive is not in regular use because of its insufficient pulling capacity and horsepower required to climb the grade before Middleton station.

Engine: 3½ HP Villiers Mk25 with reduction box
Transmission: Cup and cone reversing clutch and chain drive

===Claytons===
The railway has three battery Claytons of similar designs in private ownership. L10 (works Order No. 5431 of January 1968) and L16 (W/O No. B0109B of March 1973, named &quot;Peggy&quot;) are , low-height locomotives. They were both bought directly from industrial use. &quot;Peggy&quot; has recently been restored to operating condition, and is running using the redundant 15-year-old batteries from &quot;Greenbat&quot;. &quot;Peggy&quot; is fitted with a cam-contactor controller and resistances for speed control. &quot;Peggy&quot; serves as the primary locomotive for work trains on the SGLR, taking volunteers up and down the line to do rail and infrastructure maintenance, often seen with the tool wagon being shunted back and forth. &quot;Peggy&quot; also works on the branchline trains down into the quarry, interchanging with &quot;Peter&quot; every so often. 

&quot;Lady Margorie&quot; is a compact , Clayton. Designed to work in diameter sewer pipes, it even has a &quot;barn roof&quot; style battery box top to make maximum use of confined space. It has an electronic controller, as opposed to the more usual resistance type. On 20 May 2012 &quot;Lady Margorie&quot; was renamed &quot;Peter&quot; after the late Peter Sellers, the society chairman.

===Ladywash Mine &quot;No.6&quot;===
This was the first locomotive on the railway, bought with a large amount of track and rolling stock from Ladywash Mine, near Eyam in Derbyshire. It is a , design also from Greenwood and Batley.

It spent all its working life at Ladywash, acquiring some unconventional but highly useful modifications – the works photo appears in Adrian Booth&#x27;s book on Greenwood and Batley, and is very different from its current form. It was also fitted with a thyristor controller, which was removed before being sold.

It arrived at the SGLR in a poor state of repair, which along with the lack of controller meant it was moved around various sidings unused. Eventually it was bought in 2004, and work finally started on its restoration. Following removal from the site for shotblasting, the frames have been repainted and the axleboxes overhauled. Now back on site, it is currently a rolling chassis with brake gear being overhauled. Where necessary, new parts are being machined by its owner. Work is also currently underway on the manufacture of a replacement controller, making use of contactors and resistances from other electrical machines. Future work includes overhaul of the two traction motors, some attention to one of the gearboxes and re-cabling before reassembly.

Motors: 2× GB type T2
Batteries: 60V lead-acid
Weight: 3 tons new, 3¼–3½ tons with modifications

<doc id="1231216" wikidata="Q2156051" url="?curid=1231216" title="Rob McClanahan">
<text>Robert Bruce McClanahan (born January 9, 1958) is an American former professional ice hockey player who played 224 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Buffalo Sabres, Hartford Whalers and New York Rangers between 1980 and 1983. McClanahan was a member of the U.S. men&#x27;s Olympic hockey team that beat the Soviet Union en route to a gold medal at Lake Placid in 1980.

==Amateur and international career==
McClanahan attended Mounds View High School and went on to play three seasons for the University of Minnesota, winning the 1979 NCAA national championship. After representing the US at the 1979 World Championship tournament in Moscow, McClanahan joined the US Olympic team on a full-time basis and scored 34 goals in 63 exhibition games. The culmination of McClanahan&#x27;s amateur career came at the 1980 Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, when he scored five goals in seven games while helping his country win the gold medal. He scored the winning goal in the gold medal game against Finland (which the U.S. came back to win 4–2) two days after the historic American victory over the Soviets.

During the opening game of the Olympic tournament against Sweden, McClanahan sustained a bruise on the upper thigh, which left the US team&#x27;s roster short a second player, as teammate Jack O&#x27;Callahan had been injured during the exhibition game against the Soviet Union only three days prior to the Olympics. A now famous argument between McClanahan and Team USA&#x27;s coach Herb Brooks during the intermission helped motivate McClanahan to return to the game and play through his injury, inspiring his team to a come-from-behind draw against Sweden that proved vital to achieving gold medal success later in the tournament.

==Professional career==
McClanahan was selected forty-ninth overall in the 1978 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres but did not begin playing with the Sabres until 1980, shortly after the Olympics. His NHL career was comparatively short-lived as he was mostly used as a role player. He bounced between the NHL and the American Hockey League and played part of the 1983/1984 season in the Central Hockey League with the Tulsa Oilers before finishing his NHL career under his old Olympic coach Herb Brooks with the New York Rangers in 1984 (he also represented the Hartford Whalers in 1981–82). During his professional career, McClanahan also was a member of Team USA at the 1981 Canada Cup.

==Post-playing career==
McClanahan became a financial broker after retirement, beginning his career with Morgan Stanley in 1985, then working for Bear Stearns and Piper Jaffray, where he was managing director. He joined the Minneapolis office of ThinkEquity Partners in March 2002 as Principal and became the company&#x27;s Head of Trading.

He also was featured in &quot;American Dad!&quot; season 6 episode &quot;Return of the Bling&quot;.

McClanahan is currently the head coach of The Blake School boys varsity hockey team.

==In popular culture==
McClanahan was played by Nathan West in the 2004 Disney movie &quot;Miracle&quot;, which told the story of the 1980 U.S. Olympic gold medal win. West had been a goalie for the junior hockey team the Detroit Whalers in the Ontario Hockey League and has a tattoo of the National Hockey League logo on his arm.

In a 1981 TV movie about the same subject called &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;, McClanahan is portrayed by Ken Stovitz.

<doc id="1231218" wikidata="Q1371902" url="?curid=1231218" title="Slate (writing)">
<text>A slate is a thin piece of hard flat material, historically slate stone, which is used as a medium for writing.

== Usage ==

The writing slate consisted of a piece of slate, typically either 4x6 inches or 7x10 inches, encased in a wooden frame. Split slate was prepared by scraping with a steel edge, grinding with a flat stone and, finally, polishing with a mix of slate powder in water. Pencils were of a softer stone, such as shale, chalk or soapstone. In 1853 Charles Goodyear patented a compound of hard-vulcanised rubber with powdered porcelain, from which to make white pencils for writing on slates.

Usually, a piece of cloth or slate sponge was used to clean it and this was sometimes attached with a string to the bottom of the writing slate.

== History ==
The exact origins of the writing slate remain unclear. References to its use can be found in the fourteenth century and evidence suggests that it was used in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The central time period for the writing slate, however, &quot;appears to begin in the later eighteenth century, when developments in sea and land transport permitted the gradual expansion of slate quarrying in Wales and the growth of a substantial slate workshop industry.&quot;

By the nineteenth century, writing slates were used around the world in nearly every school and were a central part of the slate industry. At the dawn of the twentieth century, writing slates were the primary tool in the classroom for students. In the 1930s (or later) writing slates began to be replaced by more modern methods. However, writing slates did not become obsolete. They are still made in the twenty-first century, though in small quantities.

The writing slate was sometimes used by industry workers to track goods and by sailors to calculate their geographical location at sea. Sometimes multiple pieces of slate were bound together into a &quot;book&quot; and horizontal lines were etched onto the slate surface as a guide for neat handwriting.

<doc id="1231219" wikidata="Q210570" url="?curid=1231219" title="Nazca culture">
<text>The Nazca culture (also Nasca) was the archaeological culture that flourished from beside the arid, southern coast of Peru in the river valleys of the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage and the Ica Valley. Strongly influenced by the preceding Paracas culture, which was known for extremely complex textiles, the Nazca produced an array of crafts and technologies such as ceramics, textiles, and geoglyphs.

They are known for two extensive construction projects that would have required the coordination of large groups of laborers: the Nazca Lines, immense designs in the desert whose purpose is unknown, and puquios, underground aqueducts for providing water for irrigation and domestic purposes in the arid environment, several dozen of which still function today. The Nazca Province in the Ica Region was named for this people.

==History==

===Time frame===
Nazca society developed during the Early Intermediate Period and is generally divided into the Proto Nazca (phase 1, 100 BC  – 1 AD), the Early Nazca (phases 2–4, 1–450 AD), Middle Nazca (phase 5, 450–550 AD) and Late Nazca (phases 6–7, 550–750 AD) cultures.

===Decline and fall of the civilization===
From 500 AD, the civilization started to decline and by 750 AD the civilization had fallen completely. This is thought to have occurred when an &quot;El Niño&quot; triggered widespread and destructive flooding. Evidence also suggests that the Nazca people may have exacerbated the effects of these floods by gradually cutting down &quot;Prosopis pallida&quot; trees to make room for maize and cotton agriculture. These trees play an extremely important role as the ecological keystone of this landscape: in particular preventing river and wind erosion. Gradual removal of trees would have exposed the landscape to the effects of climate perturbations such as &quot;El Niño&quot;, leading to erosion and leaving irrigation systems high and dry.

==Society==

===Social structure===
Early Nazca society was made up of local chiefdoms and regional centers of power that developed around Cahuachi, a non-urban ceremonial site of earthwork mounds and plazas. Scholars have developed theories resulting from various excavations at Cahuachi. They suggest that this site was the center for rituals and feasting relating to agriculture, water, and fertility.

Cahuachi lies in the lower portion of the Nazca Valley and was initially occupied during the late Paracas phase. It is unique among all other Nazca sites in the region, and it is the most important site for the study of ancient Nazca culture. The people modified the natural &quot;huacas&quot; (hills) into pyramid mounds for ceremonial and religious purposes.
Excavations at Cahuachi have given archaeologists key insights into the culture. The material remains found at the site included large amounts of polychrome pottery, plain and fancy textiles, trace amounts of gold and &quot;spondylus&quot; shells, and an array of ritual paraphernalia. The remains of pottery found at Cahuachi led archaeologists to believe that the site was specifically non-urban and ceremonial in nature. The ratio of plain, utilitarian pottery to fine, polychrome pottery was 30% to 70%. If it was an urban center, the proportion of utilitarian ceramics would have probably been higher. Among the foodstuffs found were the Three Sisters: maize, squash, and beans; as well as peanuts, and some fish.

Construction at Cahuachi ceased. It appears that Cahuachi was abandoned at the very end of Nazca 3/early Nazca 4. Although there are many possible reasons for the collapse of Cahuachi, most scholars believe that the cessation of ceremonial use of the site is associated with the pan-Andean drought. Later (post-Cahuachi) Nazca society was structured in a similar fashion as before, but there was less emphasis on constructing large architectural complexes such as those at Cahuachi.

===Religion===
Likely related to the arid and extreme nature of the environment, Nazca religious beliefs were based upon agriculture and fertility. Much of Nazca art depicts powerful nature gods, such as the killer whale, the harvesters, the mythical spotted cat, the serpentine creature and, the most prevalent of worshiped figures, the anthropomorphic mythical being. Much as in the contemporary Moche culture based in northwest Peru. Shamans apparently used hallucinogenic drugs, such as extractions from the &#x27;San Pedro cactus&#x27; (&quot;Echinopsis pachanoi&quot;), to induce visions. The use of such substances is also depicted in art found on pottery related to the Nazca. Religious events and ceremonies took place in Cahuachi. The people worshiped the nature gods to aid in the growth of agriculture.

During this time, all members of the society in surrounding villages would migrate to the center and participate in feasting as well. Non-elites could obtain highly valued goods, such as fancy polychrome pottery, through feasting. In exchange, the elites could enhance their political power and status while co-opting the commoners into labor and construction of the site.

===Trophy heads===
The Nazca used severed heads, known as trophy heads, in various religious rituals and appear as a motif in ceramic iconography. Visual depictions of decapitations often associate the decapitators with weapons and military-like dress, but such garments could have been worn in purely ceremonial circumstances as well.

The term &#x27;trophy head&#x27; was coined by archaeologist Max Uhle, who considered the depiction of severed heads in ancient Peruvian art to correspond to trophies of warfare. Researchers noted that all the heads had one modification in common- a hole in the forehead through which a rope could be affixed, presumably so that the severed head can be displayed or carried. This detail contributed to the consensus that these were trophy heads. Other common modifications were the base of the skull being broken and thorns closing the mouth. Over 100 of the heads that have been discovered were mummified, which is unique to the Nazca and the preceding Paracas Culture.

Many burials of Nazca individuals are what is known as &#x27;partial burials&#x27;. Partial burials typically include bundles of limbs, caches of severed heads, or bodies that are missing several parts. Several burials have been discovered in which the head of the skeleton is missing and is replaced with what is most commonly referred to as a &#x27;head jar&#x27;. The head jar is a ceramic vessel with a human head painted on it, along with trees and plants sprouting from the head which is known as the Sprouting Head motif. The actual appearance of the head jars can vary majorly with some having the appearance of trophy heads and others potentially be a portrait of the person buried there.

Early Nazca period ceramics indicate that the initial purpose of trophy heads may have been related to agriculture, with iconography, such as the Sprouting Head, showing trophy heads and plants growing and some of the plants were in the shape of the trophy heads. The burial of the heads suggests that the trophy heads may have been from Nazca people and not from other people. During the Middle Nazca period, the number of severed heads appeared to have increased, this may be due to the pan-Andean drought. In the late Nazca period, the number of trophy heads reaches its peak with the skulls having an increase in damage to the skull when compared to previous periods. During the Middle Nazca period, the number of severed heads appeared to have increased dramatically, judging from the remains. In the late Nazca period, the number tapered off, although the practice of decapitation remained popular in this period. Late Nazca iconography suggests that the prestige of the leaders of Late Nazca society was enhanced by successful headhunting.

==Economy==
Nazca subsistence was based largely on agriculture. Iconography on ceramics and excavated remains indicate that the Nazca people had a varied diet, composed of maize, squash, sweet potato, manioc and achira, and a small trace of various fish. They also used several non-food crops, such as cotton for textiles, coca, San Pedro cactus, and gourds. The latter were decorated to illustrate activities in daily life.

The evidence of coca in society can be seen through remains but also in designs on ceramics. Similarly, the hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus has been illustrated in ceremonies on several polychrome pots and bowls. In terms of animal resources, the Nazca made sacrifices of llamas and guinea pigs at Cahuachi. Llamas were also commonly exploited as pack animals, shorn for their wool, and consumed as a source of meat.

Based on archaeological evidence, sometime during the Middle Nazca period, the Nazca people created an aqueduct system to sustain life in the exceedingly arid environment. The exact date of construction of the &quot;puquios&quot; has been debated for some time. Dating of the &quot;puquios&quot; is quite difficult because of the materials involved in their construction. Attempts at dating the trenches have also been difficult as the &quot;puquios&quot; were found by excavation. This destroyed the early context by which their dates might have been interpreted.

The most promising techniques used to date them thus far has been the AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) analysis of varnish that has collected on the rocks inside the &quot;puquios&quot;, as well as the study of settlement patterns in the area. These techniques have placed the original construction of the &quot;puquios&quot; at the Middle Nazca period, as indicated above.

The irrigation system was made up of underground channels, known as &quot;puquios&quot;, which tapped into the subsurface water. The channels were dug into the mountainside until they reached the aquifers under the surface. The channels were lined with river rocks. They did not use any mortar so that the water would pass into the channels. The water was transported to irrigation canals (&quot;acequias&quot;) in order to directly supply water for agricultural purposes, or the water was deposited into small reservoirs (&quot;kochas&quot;) for later domestic use. Numerous access holes or &quot;ojos&quot; (eyes) were placed along the surface of the underground channels and operated much in the same way that modern manholes do. People would descend into the &quot;puquios&quot; in order to clear obstructions or make repairs.

It is difficult to tell how long these underground channels are because extant &quot;puquios&quot; have been altered. Many of the puquios are too dangerous to explore underground. The length of the puquios are estimated by measuring the distances covered between the related ojos.

Many of the channels remain in use to this day. This also testifies to their importance to generations of ancient people in the arid environment. With modern use, people have altered the &quot;puquios&quot; to be used more efficiently, including installing motorized pumps. In some cases, the kochas have been lined with concrete in order to hold the water better. Some of the best-preserved channels are those located in Cantalloc.

==Arts and technology==

===Pottery===

The Nazca culture is characterized by its polychrome pottery, painted with at least 12 distinct colors. The shift from post-fire resin painting to pre-fire slip painting marked the end of Paracas-style pottery and the beginning of Nazca-style pottery. The amount of pottery produced by the Nazca people is greater when compared to the preceding Paracas culture. A potential reason for this is due to the relatively lesser amount of time required to produce pottery when compared to textiles, which the Paracas favored.

The use of pre-fire slip painting meant that artisans experimented to learn which slips produced certain colors. Major pottery shapes include double-spout bottles, bowls, cups, vases, effigy forms, and mythical creatures. Archaeologists have excavated highly valued polychrome pottery among all classes of Nazca society, illustrating that it was not just the elite that had access to them. Commoners were able to obtain these goods through feasting and pilgrimages to Cahuachi. This distribution of pottery was useful in spreading the ruling class&#x27;s culture. In addition, clays matching the chemical signature of polychrome pottery found all over the Southern Nazca Region have been found near Cahuachi. However, there is no substantial evidence of pottery production at Cahuachi. The site was most likely a redistribution center for ceramics.

The Nazca pottery sequence has been divided into nine phases. Visual depictions found on pottery from Phase 1 (also called Proto-Nazca) incorporated realistic subject matter such as fruits, plants, people, and animals. An indicator of the phase is the pottery having motifs cut into the pottery, much like the preceding Paracas-style pottery, but using slip painting instead of resin painting. Realism increased in importance in the following three phases (2, 3, 4) referred to as the Monumental phases. The pottery from these phases include renditions of their main subject matter against a bold red, black, or white background.

In the next phase, Nazca 5, considerable experimentation occurred, including the addition of rays, volutes, and other &quot;proliferous&quot; attachments to the supernatural motifs on the vessels. Phase 5 is called Transitional, since it bridges the change in style between the naturalism of Phases 2-4 and the proliferous elements added to the motifs in Phases 6 and 7. Nazca 5 also sees militaristic motifs becoming more common due to a drought causing conflict.
Nazca 6, and 7 include some of the earlier motifs but also emphasizes militaristic ones, suggesting a shift in social organization. The motifs in these phases include abstract elements as part of the design. Large numbers of rays and tassels are appended to many of the designs, particularly those depicting mythical subjects, producing a visual impression of almost infinitely multiplied elements, an impression which accounts for the use of the term &#x27;proliferous&#x27;. Pottery art of Nazca phases 6 and 7 also displays influence from the Moche culture of north coastal Peru.

Finally, during Nazca 8 disjointed figures and a geometric iconography was introduced that has been difficult to decipher. Phases 8 and 9 are now believed to date to the Middle Horizon. This period was one of a shift in power from the coast to the highlands with the advent of the Wari culture about 650 CE.

The Nazca, like all other Pre-Columbian societies in South America including the Inca, had no writing system, in contrast to the contemporary Maya of Mesoamerica. The iconography or symbols on their ceramics served as a means of communication. The motifs depicted on Nazca pottery fall into two major categories: sacred and profane. The Nazca believed in powerful nature spirits who were thought to control most aspects of life. The Nazca visualized these nature spirits in the form of mythical beings, creatures having a combination of human and animal/bird/fish characteristics, and painted them onto their pottery. These Mythical Beings include such varieties as the Anthropomorphic Mythical Being, Horrible Bird, Mythical Killer Whale, Spotted Cat, Feline Man and Rayed Face.

Scenes of warfare, decapitation, and the ritual use of human trophy heads by shamans were common motifs in Nazca pottery.

===Textiles===
The Nazca are also known for their technically complex textiles. The textiles were most likely woven by women at habitation sites from spun cotton and wool. The textiles would have been made using a backstrap loom. This is similar to the way textiles are woven in the region today. Textiles were woven with the common motifs earlier than they appeared painted on pottery. The dry desert has preserved the textiles of both the Nazca and Paracas cultures, which comprise most of what is known about early textiles in the region.

Shawls, dresses, tunics, belts, and bags have been found through excavations at Cahuachi and elsewhere. Many textiles associated with the Nazca culture are garments that were included with grave goods found at burial sites. Almost every body found is wrapped (sometimes partially) in a textile as a part of burial ritual. These textiles are found with partial burials as well. Often piles of bones are found wrapped in a textile garment. The deposits of dresses and shawls contained both high-status garments (with feathers, painting, embroidery) and plain garments, suggesting different social roles or responsibilities.

The &quot;Paracas Textile&quot; a beautifully preserved textile from the Early Intermediate period (300BC-100AD) is one of the finest textiles known. This textile, also known as BMT (Brooklyn Museum Textile), is in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. The mantle measures 62x148 cm and it is worked in cotton and camelid fibers with several different techniques. The middle part is a very fine gauze weave, most probably woven on a back-strap loom in a typical four-selvage web with both warp and weft made of cotton. This central web is patterned with 32 repeating rayed heads in six different colors. The coloring was achieved by the painstaking warp wrapping method, where the warp is covered in sections with dyed camelid fleece. The plain weave over the wrapped areas create a double faced cloth, which are perfectly mirroring each other. The absolute symmetry of the design is broken on the long edges, where one side has extra spiral motifs and the other finished with stepped triangles. Folding the semitransparent cloth lengthwise would bring these edges together forming the stepped fret design, widely used element in both Andean and Meso-American designs. The three-dimensional edging is a colorful procession of 90 highly detailed colorful characters. The edging is worked in camelid yarn using the cross-knit looping method. Warriors or lords with war paraphernalia, women and shamans with the addition of two llamas are walking around the edge on a red band, which is attached to the central woven web with rhythmically repeated colored flowers. The backs and the fronts of the figures are mirror images, except for three figures. Besides the figures there is an abundance of vegetation represented, which is characteristic in Nasca textile works. The three-dimensional edging attached to the light weight midsection suggests that this mantel was never hang and most likely used laid out on the ground serving as a field for divination. Lois Martin who studied the mantel extensively suggests that perhaps it was used as a calendar to track the timing of rituals.

Mary Frame&#x27;s extensive analysis of textiles from Cahuachi has revealed more about Nazca women. She noted that although the women are rarely recognized in the archaeological record, they had ready access to high-status materials and the right to wear sacred or potent imagery on their garments. This gave an indication of their status. A large portion of dresses were found portraying birds with speckled bodies, double-headed serpentine figures, and anthropomorphic figures.

===Nazca Lines===
The geoglyphs of Nazca or &quot;Nazca Lines&quot; are a series of geometric shapes, miles of lines, and large drawings of animal figures (some as large as a football field) constructed on the desert floor in the Nazca region. Many theories have arisen about the great geoglyphs. They are believed to have been constructed by large, coordinated work groups of numerous people over an extended period of time, indicating a complex culture that could organize such projects. Researchers have demonstrated techniques to explore how this was done.

By extending a rope between two posts and removing the red pebbles on the desert surface along the rope, the lines could be constructed. The contrast of the red desert pebbles and the lighter earth beneath would make the lines visible from a high altitude. Due to the simplistic construction of the geoglyphs, regular amounts of rainfall would have easily eroded the drawings, but the dry desert environment has preserved the lines for hundreds of years.

The purpose of the lines continues to be debated. Some researchers theorize they were created for the gods to look upon them from above, while others suggest they were some sort of calendar with astronomical alignments that would aid in planting and harvesting of crops. Others have thought the lines were the pathways for important ceremonial processions. The lines have been studied by experts from several disciplines. Anthropologists, archaeologists, and astronomers have all studied the lines, but have not found conclusive evidence for any of the theories as to purpose.

===Trephination and cranial manipulation===
Trephination was a primitive skull surgery used by the Nazca that relieved pressure on the brain from battle wounds or for ritual purposes. It entails the removal of one or more sections of bone from the skull (while the person is still alive). Evidence of trephination has been seen through the analysis of excavated skulls. Some of the skulls show signs of healing, evidence that the person had survived the operation.

Elongated skulls, as a result of skull manipulation, were also seen in the excavations from Cahuachi. This effect was achieved by binding a cushion to an infant&#x27;s forehead and a board to the back of the head. Archaeologists can only speculate as to why this was done to some of the skulls. Several theories suggest skull manipulation created an ethnic identity, formed the individual into a social being, or may have illustrated social status.

Some historic Native American cultures in North America also practiced such shaping of skulls, such as the Snake, Cowlitz and Chinook peoples, most of whom lived west of the Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest. They were informally known as the Flathead peoples.

<text>Dan Popik (born March 23, 1979, in Syosset, New York) is a retired American soccer goalkeeper who is currently coaching at CASL for the U14, U15, and U16 teams, representing all three in Region 3 play. He has previously served as an assistant with the Carolina RailHawks of the USL First Division and two Division I men&#x27;s teams, NC State and Furman. Popik last played goalkeeper for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer.

A highly touted prospect who spent time with the Under-20 United States national team, Popik played college soccer at St. John&#x27;s University, but left after two seasons. He did not get into MLS right away; instead, he signed with the A-League&#x27;s Milwaukee Rampage in 2000. Popik would play three years for the club, leading them to the league championship in 2002.

Popik signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy prior to the 2003 MLS season as backup to Kevin Hartman. In two seasons, he only appeared in two league games, neither of them starts. The Galaxy released Popik after the 2004 season. He was the lone player who ended the 2004 season on an MLS roster to attempt to become a replacement player for the U.S. national team during the labor dispute in early 2005.

He is currently the assistant coach/goalkeeper coach at North Carolina State University. In 2006, he joined the Columbus Crew as an injury replacement and played one game. He remained at NC State until 2009 when he became the goalkeeper coach with the Carolina RailHawks of the USL First Division. In 2011, he became associate head coach at Furman University, and took his position at Green Bay in 2013. He stepped down from Green Bay prior to the 2014 season.

<text>Hot Press is a monthly music and politics magazine based in Dublin, Ireland, founded in June 1977. The magazine has been edited since its inception by Niall Stokes.

==History==
&quot;Hot Press&quot; was founded in June 1977 by Niall Stokes, who continues to be its editor to the present day. Since then, the magazine has featured stories in the music world, both in Ireland and internationally.

The first issue of &quot;Hot Press&quot; featured Irish blues rock musician Rory Gallagher ahead of his headlining performance at Ireland&#x27;s first open air rock festival, the Macroom Mountain Dew Festival, in 1977. The magazine has covered the career of U2 since the late 1970s. Sinéad O&#x27;Connor first talked to &quot;Hot Press&quot; about her lesbianism.

The magazine has been at the centre of several controversies: for example, &quot;Hot Press&quot; writer Stuart Clark was interviewing Oasis band member and songwriter Noel Gallagher when Gallagher found out that his brother Liam would not take the stage for that evening&#x27;s performance, and the band came close to splitting up.

&quot;Hot Press&quot; was at the centre of a legal dispute over the copyright of the term De Dannan in 2009 after it featured an advertisement using the term to promote a new tour by the traditional group.

In September 2009, an interview conducted by Olaf Tyaransen with the comedian Tommy Tiernan at Electric Picnic 2009 proved controversial when Tiernan made some remarks which were later perceived as antisemitic. The comments were reported in the Irish and international media; however, both Tyaransen and &quot;Hot Press&quot; editor Niall Stokes, as well as Tiernan himself, defended them as being taken out of context.

In 2020, in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic lock down in Ireland, Hot Press held a set of online music sessions called the Lockdown Sessions featuring artists such as Celaviedmai, Doppler, and Tebi Rex.

== Contributors ==
Past writers for &quot;Hot Press&quot; have included ninth President of Ireland Michael D. Higgins, the authors of BAFTA award-winning &quot;Father Ted&quot;, Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews, &quot;Sunday Times&quot; television reviewer Liam Fay, author and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; columnist Neil McCormick, Bill Graham, &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot; US correspondent Niall Stanage, &quot;Irish Examiner&quot; soccer correspondent Liam Mackey, author Damian Corless, the former &quot;The Irish Times&quot; columnist John Waters and film critic Tara Brady, food writer John McKenna, &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; journalist Declan Lynch and &quot;The Guardian&quot; football writer, &quot;Football Weekly&quot; regular Barry Glendenning, &quot;Daily Mail&quot; writer Jason O&#x27;Toole and Olaf Tyaransen.

Current writers include Peter Murphy, Jackie Hayden, and Pat Carty.

==Politics==
&quot;Hot Press&quot; has had a centrist stance on politics and social issues. During the 2007 general election it supported many smaller left wing parties such as the Green Party and Labour. It was critical of the then Fianna Fáil government, pro-Seanad reform and was opposed to the June 2007 decision of the Irish Film Censor&#x27;s Office to ban the videogame &quot;Manhunt 2&quot; This is the first time a video game has been refused certification by the IFCO.

The magazine has interviewed several politicians, including Sinn Féin&#x27;s Gerry Adams, DUP&#x27;s Ian Paisley Jr. MLA, leader of the Green Party, John Gormley and Minister for Finance, Brian Cowen.

The sort of smug know-all commentator... I suppose if anything annoys me, that annoys me... I could instance a load of fuckers whose throat I&#x27;d cut, and push over the nearest cliff, but there&#x27;s no percentage in that. – Former Taoiseach Charles Haughey speaking to &quot;Hot Press&quot; writer John Waters in 1984.

In his May 2007 interview with Jason O&#x27;Toole, former Minister for Health Cowen admitted to smoking marijuana, saying,

Anyone who went to the UCD bar in the &#x27;70s that didn&#x27;t get a whiff of marijuana would be telling you a lie. I would say there were a couple of occasions when it was passed around – and, unlike President Clinton, I did inhale! There wasn&#x27;t a whole lot in it really – (it was like) a Sweet Afton, as a 10-year-old, under a railway bridge on a rainy day, in small town Ireland in the late &#x27;60s. I certainly got more enjoyment out of a few pints.

This confession later provoked much criticism from opposition parties in the Dáil. Ministers Willie O&#x27;Dea and Brian Lenihan Jnr played down the controversy, denying Cowen was &quot;setting a bad example&quot;. Mr. Cowen later became Taoiseach following the resignation of Bertie Ahern.

In June 2007, DUP&#x27;s Ian Paisley Jr. MLA caused uproar in an interview with Jason O&#x27;Toole by publicly denouncing acts associated with homosexuality. This was the year before Iris Robinson, wife of First Minister, Peter Robinson made her thoughts on the issue.

<text>In sports, a utility player is one who can play several positions competently. Sports in which the term is often used include association football, basketball, American football, baseball, rugby union, rugby league, softball, ice hockey, and water polo. 

The term has gained prominence in all sports due to its use in fantasy leagues, but in rugby union and rugby league, it is commonly used by commentators to recognize a player&#x27;s versatility.

The use of this term to describe a player may in some circumstances be a backhanded compliment, as it suggests the player is not good enough to be considered a specialist in one position (i.e., a jack of all trades).

== Association football ==
In association football, like other sports, a utility player can play in several positions in the outfield.

Nowadays, most outfield players, especially midfielders, at the professional level can play multiple positions. The most common dual role is when a central defender is played in the left or right full-back position. This often occurs due to injuries to starting full-backs. As central defenders are usually taller, slower, and less technically adept in crossing and attacking play, such a change in position is often accompanied by a tactical shift designed to ensure the player remains in a more defensive posture than regular full-backs would be in. Another common dual role is for faster attacking players to be used as a forward, winger, or a combination of the two roles – known as a &quot;wing-forward&quot;.

Examples include Frenchman Eduardo Camavinga of Real Madrid, a midfielder who can also function as a left-sided full-back or winger. Spaniard Sergi Roberto played in seven different positions, including full-back, centre-back, midfielder and winger, at Barcelona between 2016 and 2018. Manchester United&#x27;s Phil Jones has been used as a right-back and centre-back while also taking up midfield roles at times. Another defender, Bjørn Paulsen from Denmark, is also adept on the wing or in the centre of midfield and has also successfully taken the role of striker, especially when his teams were losing. James Milner, who made over 200 league appearances for Liverpool, has played in central midfield, full-back, winger and even striker. Chinese international Yu Dabao started his career as a striker, but has transitioned between defence and attack ever since Roger Schmidt took charge of his club Beijing Guoan.

Ivaylo Yordanov, Lee McCulloch, Magnus Erlingmark and especially Ruud Gullit had played in many outfield roles, with the Dutchman in particular having the ability to change positions within a single game to fill in gaps caused by substitutions. Former Irish international John O&#x27;Shea is known for playing in all positions in his tenure with Manchester United. Even further back in time, some footballers had a high degree of versatility: Bill Lacey, who played his top-flight football with Everton and Liverpool during the pre-war and inter-war periods, played in all eleven traditional positions (10 outfield plus goalkeeper) in his career; John Charles, a legendary figure both in his native Wales and Juventus of Italy, was both a striker and centre-back in his playing days; and 1966 FIFA World Cup winner Martin Peters, who played in every position, including goalkeeper in particularly dire situations, for West Ham United.

In the women&#x27;s game, notable examples are China&#x27;s Wang Shanshan and the United States&#x27; Crystal Dunn, as well as Germans Simone Laudehr and Linda Bresonik.

Some outfield players have also made competent substitute goalkeepers, for example Phil Jagielka, Jan Koller (originally trained as a goalkeeper before converting into a striker) and Cosmin Moți. But in the case of goalkeepers playing as outfield players, it is extremely rare; David James for Manchester City in 2005 match against Middlesbrough for one instance. Some may be free kick and penalty specialists (Rogério Ceni, José Luis Chilavert, Jorge Campos, etc.), but they do not hold a proper outfield role.

== Baseball ==
In baseball, a utility player is a player who can play several different positions. In general, each Major League Baseball team has at least one player who can be described as a utility player.

Most professional teams have two types of utility players. There are &quot;utility infielders&quot;, who usually play all of the infield positions (plus occasionally catcher). Utility outfielders or &quot;fourth outfielders&quot; tend to play all three outfield positions at various times. Occasionally, there will be players who perform a combination of the two duties. Utility players tend to be players who come off the bench, though this is not absolute. Often, players who do not have high prospects to be a major league star will learn additional positions so they can look more attractive to major league clubs as bench talent.

A third type of utility player is often seen in youth baseball, and occasionally in college baseball—a player talented enough as a pitcher and position player to play in both roles. The term &quot;utility player&quot; is not typically used to describe such an individual, with &quot;two-way player&quot; used instead.

Even more rarely, a player can have the talent to play both roles at the top professional level. Babe Ruth began his career as a pitcher, but proved to be such a strong hitter that he briefly alternated in the two roles until becoming a full-time position player. A current example is Shohei Ohtani, who made the Best Nine of Japan&#x27;s Pacific League as both a pitcher and a hitter in 2016, and is a designated hitter / starting pitcher who formerly played for the Los Angeles Angels and currently plays for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

== Basketball ==
The term &quot;utility player&quot; is rarely used in basketball outside of fantasy basketball leagues. Instead; basketball uses the terms tweener and swingman to refer to a player who can play two or three different positions, with more specific terms being combo guard, point forward, forward-center, and stretch four.

==American football==
In American football, the utility player is often capable of playing multiple positions, and often they may play both offense and defense. The concept was far more common in the early days of football, when pro teams used their best athletes in as many ways as possible, and substitutions were far more restricted, meaning players had to stay on the field for offense, defense, and &quot;special teams&quot;. This was known as the one-platoon system.

The triple threat man, who could run, pass, and kick, was particularly popular during the early days of football from the time the forward pass was invented to the World War II era (see, for instance, Bradbury Robinson, Tommy Hughitt, Sammy Baugh, and, during his college years, Johnny Unitas). Most levels of football lifted the substitution restrictions during the post-World War II era in the late 1940s, beginning with &quot;platooning&quot; (use of different offensive and defensive units) and eventually transitioning to complete free substitution. Chuck Bednarik, a center and linebacker, was the last full-time two way player in the NFL, having retired in 1962. Despite this, the American Football League of the 1960s frequently used players at multiple positions, particularly kickers and punters (e.g. George Blanda, Paul Maguire, Cookie Gilchrist, Gino Cappelletti, and Gene Mingo, a running back who became the first black placekicker in modern professional football, among others). Because of increased injury risk awareness, since the AFL-NFL merger these types of players are increasingly rare, and true utility players usually end up specializing in one position (for example, Lane Johnson played quarterback, tight end, defensive end and offensive tackle through college but was tagged specifically at offensive tackle when drafted into the NFL, and Lorenzo Alexander, who earned a reputation as a &quot;one-man gang&quot; for his ability to play multiple positions, had settled in as a linebacker for most of his career in the NFL). Those that do play multiple positions for any extended period of time are mostly backups (e.g. Guido Merkens and Brad Smith) or career minor-league players (e.g. Don Jonas, Eric Crouch, and Charles Puleri). It is still very common in smaller high schools to see top players play two or even three ways (offense, defense, and special teams), in multiple positions, but in college and pro ball, where rosters are larger and the talent pool is more elite, the injury risk outweighs potential benefits.

In the National Football League, Bill Belichick, former coach of the New England Patriots, frequently uses utility players. Belichick has used his linebackers, including Bryan Cox and Mike Vrabel, as H-backs on offense, and Belichick has doubled his wide receivers (e.g. Troy Brown and Randy Moss) as cornerbacks and safeties. Former Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans defensive end J. J. Watt has also been utilized in multiple positions. Watt lined up at tight end in special goal-line packages in 2014, catching three touchdown passes. The 6&#x27; 5&quot; Watt played tight end in high school and his first year of college at Central Michigan before becoming a full-time defensive player. Likewise, Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Kyle Williams played sparingly as a fullback in the last two years of his career, catching a pass, rushing for a touchdown, and blocking for another. William &quot;The Refrigerator&quot; Perry, a defensive tackle for the Chicago Bears, famously played as a fullback to score a touchdown in Super Bowl XX.

The tackle eligible is a special form of utility player. Examples of those who used this play notably include Jason Peters, Warren Sapp, Jumbo Elliott, Mitch Frerotte, Anthony Muñoz, Joe Staley, and Donald Penn. In such a situation, a player who is lined up in the offensive tackle position is eligible to catch a forward pass. Another example of a type of utility player is the halfback option play, in which a running back performs the passing duties of a quarterback. Walter Payton, LaDainian Tomlinson, and, most recently, Derrick Henry have used this play multiple times, and this type of play has spawned an entire offensive scheme. Note that generally, a player who plays one regular position as well as special teams is &quot;usually&quot; not considered a utility player, nor are hybrid running back/wide receivers such as Reggie Bush; only those who play two distinct offensive and/or defensive positions are considered such, as are those who play an offensive or defensive position and in addition kick or punt.

The &quot;offense/offensive weapon&quot; (also known as OW) is an offensive player that can play multiple offensive positions. The OW role contains, but is not limited to, players that can play quarterback, running back, tight end, and wide receiver. Kordell Stewart was the first player to be used in this role back in the 1990s, but it became popular in the early 2010s. Back when Stewart played this role, it was known as the &quot;Slash&quot; role. The Jacksonville Jaguars&#x27; OW Denard Robinson was the first to be officially an OW. Recent examples of the OW position include former New York Giants quarterback Joe Webb, Atlanta Falcons running back Cordarrelle Patterson, and New Orleans Saints quarterback Taysom Hill. Webb has also played wide receiver throughout his career, while Hill has lined up at every offensive position with the exception of offensive lineman. Hill also plays special teams as a gunner and kick returner.

The Arena Football League, for many years, made almost all of its players, with the exception of two players on each side (always a quarterback, a kicker (the quarterback and kicker were never on the field at the same time) and usually a wide receiver and two defensive backs), play both sides of the ball; this was known as &quot;ironman&quot;. The &quot;ironman&quot; concept was dropped in 2007.

With the exception of the now defunct NFL Europe, almost all European American Football leagues have players that play offense, defense, and special teams. Especially when the number of &quot;American&quot; players is limited, they are often on the field for as many snaps as possible, both on offense and defense.

== Ice hockey ==
In Ice hockey, it is common for centres and wingers to play either position in certain situations. Depending on need, a team may use a natural centreman on the wing if they have too many centres or, conversely, a winger may be pressed to play centre because of a lack of suitable players in that area. Because of the frequency of forwards playing both positions, the term utility player tends to refer not to a player that plays more than one forward position, but to a player that can play both defence and forward. Teams may use a defenceman as a forward, or vice versa, for a variety of reasons.

Sometimes a natural defenceman who struggles on the defensive side of the game but possesses strong offensive qualities may be used as a winger. Marc-Andre Bergeron and Kurtis Foster, for example, have proven to be quality offensive defencemen who struggle in defending their own zone. As such, they have dressed as forwards so their teams can continue to use their offensive abilities on the powerplay while still using the standard six defencemen during even strength.

An extra defenceman may also be pressed to play forward in an emergency situation, where a team has a rash of injuries to their forwards and do not have time to summon a replacement player from a farm team.

It is very common for teams to use a forward on &quot;the point&quot; during the powerplay to provide a greater offensive threat. Though the forward is playing defence in this situation, they are not necessarily seen as true utility players.

Along with Bergeron and Foster, other notable defencemen that have played forward at some point in their careers include Phil Housley, Brent Burns, Mark Streit, Christoph Schubert, Ian White and Chris Campoli. Notable forwards who have played defence include Sergei Fedorov, Mathieu Dandenault, Brooks Laich and Sami Kapanen.

In some cases a player has made a full-time conversion from one position to the other and experienced success. Hockey Hall of Famer Red Kelly spent the first half of his career as an offensive defenceman for the Detroit Red Wings before finishing his career as a strong two-way centreman for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Wendel Clark was a star defenceman in junior before converting to left wing and scoring over 300 goals and 500 points in 15 NHL seasons. (Some junior hockey teams have a tendency to put their best offensive players on defence instead of as forwards, since defencemen generally have more time on the ice.) Dustin Byfuglien is an example of a current player who has made the switch from forward to defence full-time. Jonathan Ericsson of the Detroit Red Wings is another example of a player who converted from forward to defense.

It is extremely rare for goaltenders to play any position other than goaltender; likewise, it is just as rare for non-goaltenders to suit up in goal, because of the significant difference in skills and equipment required for the position.

== Rugby league ==
The use of utility in rugby league is more expansive because not only would a player play only at backs&#x27; (or forwards&#x27;) positions, some may play in forward and back positions with similar roles (e.g. halfback/hooker), or even play so many different positions as injury cover. Lance Hohaia is a prime example of this as he played in six different positions in his NRL career.

== Rugby union ==
Utility player is a term used mostly in New Zealand. In rugby union, it comes in a form of utility back. It is mostly a back who can cover at least two positions. Notable examples in New Zealand include Daniel Bowden, Luke McAlister and Cory Jane, but Australia also has many utility backs like Adam Ashley-Cooper, Kurtley Beale, Matt Giteau and James O&#x27;Connor. South African examples are François Steyn and Johan Goosen. Example of English utility backs include Austin Healey, who played for England as a scrum-half, fly-half, wing and full back, and Mike Catt, who was capped as a fly-half, centre and full back. French Thomas Ramos, Jérémy Sinzelle and Damien Traille are known for their versatility too.

Despite that, there are forwards who are capable of covering multiple positions. Many players in the back row of the scrum (flankers and number eights) will frequently switch between the two positions, like Grégory Alldritt, David Pocock or Kieran Read. Notable players in English rugby have made the transition between back row to the back line as they possess transferable skills and are usually the quicker and more mobile of the pack, more often a player may also be capable of playing lock as well as a back row position, with several modern examples being Sébastien Chabal, Maro Itoje, Courtney Lawes, Steven Luatua and Cameron Woki, all with international caps in both rows of the scrum. However, this description never applies to props who can play both ends of the front row (i.e. Numbers 1 &amp; 3), unless the player has the ability to cover as a hooker (e.g. John Afoa, a prop who could cover as a hooker, or John Smit, primarily a hooker but also capped internationally at both prop positions).

== Fantasy sports ==
In fantasy baseball and basketball, a utility player is a player (specifically a batter in baseball) who accumulates statistics without being assigned to a particular position. The batter can play any position; he need not actually be a utility player (for example, if a fantasy manager has two first baseman, he can assign one to the first base position and one to a utility slot). Similarly, a person assigned a utility slot in fantasy basketball need not be a tweener or swingman.

<doc id="1231232" wikidata="Q923595" url="?curid=1231232" title="St. Michael's Church, Cluj-Napoca">
<text>The St. Michael&#x27;s Church (, , ) is a Gothic-style Roman Catholic church in Cluj-Napoca. It is the second largest church (after the Biserica Neagră of Brașov) in the geographical region of Transylvania, Romania. The nave is 50 meters long and 24 meters wide, the apse is 20×10 m. The tower with its height of 76 meter (80 meter including the cross) is the highest one in Transylvania.

==History==
The construction was begun probably in place of the Saint James Chapel. The financing of the church was partly done by the citizens, partly from the income of indulgences. The first related document, dating back to 1349 and signed by the archbishop of Avignon and fifteen other bishops, grants the indulgence for those contributing to the illumination and furniture of the Saint Michael Church. The construction was completed between 1442 and 1447, the old tower being built between 1511 and 1545. The tower that stands today was erected in 1862.

The church was converted, along with the local population, to Lutheran Protestantism between 1545 and 1566. Then the more radical Unitarian party took it over in the period 1566–1716. At last, it was confiscated in the Counter-Reformation by the Catholic Church with the support of the Habsburg government.

The Baroque clock tower was replaced in the 19th century by a new one, built in the Gothic Revival style (1837–1862).

===Events===
Some important historical events that took place in the church:
* 26 July 1551: Queen Isabella of Hungary gives the Hungarian Crown to General Castaldo, the deputy of Ferdinand I., and cedes with that Hungary and Transylvania
* 23 October 1556: Queen Isabella returns and takes back the reign of Transylvania, in the name of her son, the child John II Sigismund Zápolya
* 27 March 1601: the third investiture of Sigismund Báthory as Prince of Transylvania 
* 12 February 1607: election of Sigismund Rákóczi as Prince of Transylvania 
* 7 March 1608: election of Gabriel Báthory as Prince of Transylvania 
* 13 October 1613: election of Gabriel Bethlen as Prince of Transylvania 
* 18 May 1944: the speech of Áron Márton, bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in Transylvania in which he strongly condemned the deportation of Jews.

==Description==
The west portal is decorated with the three coats of arms of Sigismund as King of Hungary, as King of Bohemia and as Holy Roman Emperor.

The oldest of its sections is the altar, inaugurated in 1390, while the newest part is the Gothic Revival-style clock tower, which was built in 1837–1862 and replaced a Baroque predecessor.

<doc id="1231234" wikidata="Q1701122" url="?curid=1231234" title="National Marine Sanctuary">
<text>A U.S. National Marine Sanctuary is a federally designated area within United States waters that protects areas of the marine environment with special conservation, recreational, ecological, historical, cultural, archeological, scientific, educational, or aesthetic qualities. The program was established in 1972 by the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act and is currently administered by the National Ocean Service through the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA).

While National Marine Sanctuaries are multiple-use areas, the NMSA emphasizes that one of the express purposes of a sanctuary is to “maintain the natural biological communities” and to “protect and, where appropriate, restore and enhance natural habitats, populations, and ecological processes.” The National Marine Sanctuary System consists of 17 marine protected areas that encompass about . Individual areas range from less than .

The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS), a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), administers the 17 national marine sanctuaries. The program began after the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill off the coast of California brought the plight of marine ecosystems to national attention. The United States Congress responded in 1972 with the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act which allowed for the creation of marine sanctuaries. The resources protected by U.S. national marine sanctuaries range from coral reef ecosystems in American Samoa, Florida, Hawaii, and Texas, to shipwrecks in the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean.

The NMSP also is involved in the administration of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument and the Rose Atoll Marine National Monument, although they are not U.S. national marine sanctuaries. The NMSP jointly administers the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in conjunction with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the State of Hawaii, and it jointly administers the Rose Atoll Marine National Monument with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

==Scope of protection==

Designation as a National Marine Sanctuary does not automatically prohibit fishing and other activities. Recreational and commercial fishing is allowed in some sanctuaries. It is possible to restrict consumptive or destructive activities through the initial designation process and NMSP actions. There are restrictions in some sanctuaries that are enforced by other governing agencies. For example, current regulations restricting fishing in Stellwagen Bank were not issued by the NMSP, but rather by National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) and the New England Fishery Management Council, which have jurisdiction in federal waters off the New England coast generally. The private nonprofit organization Marine Conservation Institute has compiled fact sheets for each sanctuary listing activities which are directly regulated by the NMSP.

== Designating sanctuary sites ==
Site selection is done under the auspices of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Regional teams of marine scientists identify geographically representative sites for potential marine sanctuaries. NOAA then selects candidate sites and meets with state or territorial resource managers and/or the state or territorial governor&#x27;s staff to determine the local level of interest in establishing a sanctuary. If there is mutually satisfactory interest, the candidate sites are evaluated through a process of public and legislative review and validated by the United States Congress and state or territorial governments. NOAA initiates the designation by the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and a proposed management plan, then publishes a notice of its plans in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. NOAA sponors regional meetings and public hearings to gather comments. The U.S. Congress receives the draft statements and may conduct its own hearings. NOAA prepares a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) that addresses the concerns raised in the DEIS process and distributes it for comment. Finally, upon approval of the President of the United States, the United States Secretary of Commerce, who oversees NOAA, designates the area as a National Marine Sanctuary. The U.S. Congress and the governor of the state or territory then may formally object to or appeal the designation.

==List of U.S. National Marine Sanctuaries==

The National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa originally was named the Fagatelle Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary originally was named the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary.

===Former sanctuaries===

These sanctuaries were subsumed by the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary on November 16, 1990, but continued to operate until July 1, 1997, when they were integrated into the Florida Keys sanctuary and redesignated as Existing Management Areas.

<text>Crowfoot (c. 1830 – 25 April 1890) or Isapo-Muxika (; ) was a chief of the Siksika. His father, (Packs a Knife), and mother, (Attacked Towards Home), were Kainai. He was five years old when was killed during a raid on the Crow tribe, and, a year later, his mother remarried to (Many Names) of the Siksika people among whom he was brought up. Crowfoot was a warrior who fought in as many as nineteen battles and sustained many injuries, but he tried to obtain peace instead of warfare. Crowfoot is well known for his involvement in Treaty Number 7 and did much negotiating for his people. While many believe Chief Crowfoot had no part in the North-West Rebellion, he did in fact participate to an extent due to his son&#x27;s connection to the conflict. Crowfoot died of tuberculosis at Blackfoot Crossing on April 25, 1890. Eight hundred of his tribe attended his funeral, along with government dignitaries. In 2008, Chief Crowfoot was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame where he was recognized for his contributions to the railway industry. Crowfoot is well known for his contributions to the Blackfoot nation, and has many memorials to signify his accomplishments.

==Early life==
Chief Crowfoot was born in 1830 to the Kainai, known to traders and settlers as the Bloods, one of the tribes of the Blackfoot Confederacy. His father was (&quot;Packs a Knife&quot;) and his mother was (&quot;Attacked Towards Home&quot;). He was first known as &quot;Shot-Close&quot;. Later as a boy, he was given the name Bear Ghost and then his father’s name &quot;Packs a Knife&quot;, after he had been killed by members of the Crow tribe. These different names came at different times in his life as he proved himself a skilled Blackfoot warrior and, later, chief. A year after his father died, his mother remarried a member of the Siksika tribe, (&quot;Many Names&quot;), who eventually brought his new wife back to his tribe. Crowfoot followed his new father and mother to the Siksika on foot for several hours, eventually causing the two to turn around and bring both the young Crowfoot and his grandfather Scabby Bull with them to the Blackfoot tribe. It was with this tribe where Crowfoot proved himself as a warrior and leader.

==Leadership of the Siksika Nation==
Crowfoot’s bravery and determination earned him respect from fellow Blackfoot, but it was his skills as a voice of peace and reason that made him one of the most respected Canadian natives when he rose to become one of the leaders of the Blackfoot nation. Crowfoot was often called , which means &#x27;father of the people&#x27;, because of his caring nature in regards to his tribe members. He was known to provide food to those who needed it in his tribe.

Crowfoot worked hard to build relations between the Blackfoot and the agents of different organizations that came into their lands, such as the Hudson’s Bay Company and the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP). This effort by Crowfoot sometimes led him to come into conflict with other members of his nation, such as when he stopped a group of Blackfoot warriors from raiding a Hudson’s Bay caravan.

Late in 1866 he prevented a number of Blackfoot warriors from looting a train of Hudson’s Bay Company carts and killing its Métis drivers. Then, defying a number of warrior chiefs, he provided a safe escort for the Métis back to Fort Edmonton. He also became a good friend of HBC trader Richard Charles Hardisty who was in charge of Rocky Mountain House.

Crowfoot had interactions with another famous chief, Sitting Bull. These interactions occurred when the Blackfoot moved south following the disappearing bison herds. When the Blackfoot arrived in Sioux territory, Sitting Bull invited Crowfoot to combine their strength and fight against both the United States and the NWMP. Crowfoot refused this offer, understanding that his people and the Sioux together were not strong enough to stand for long against the strength of the United States military and the Canadian government. Eventually, Crowfoot led the Blackfoot back into Canadian territory, leaving on bad terms with Sitting Bull. When the Sioux came into Canada, fleeing pursuing American forces, Crowfoot made peace with Sitting Bull and his tribe. This helped protect the Sioux from pursuing American forces for a time, but eventually economic factors forced the Blackfoot to push the police to force the Sioux back into the United States.

==Family==
Crowfoot had a total of 10 wives throughout his life, but never more than four at a time. His first wife was named Cutting Woman, and she was favoured over the other wives. Crowfoot had many children with his wives, but only four of them lived to adulthood: one son, who was blind, and three daughters. At one point Crowfoot had a son that showed potential as a warrior and leader but he was killed in his early teenage years in a battle against the Cree. Crowfoot vowed to avenge the death of his son and personally led a raid against a nearby Cree camp to kill one Cree tribe member. During the raid, the Blackfoot captured a young Cree man, who bore a resemblance to Crowfoot&#x27;s dead son. Crowfoot adopted the young man. Later this Cree man returned to his people and became the chief Poundmaker.

==North-West Rebellion==
In 1885 Louis Riel returned to Canada after spending several years in the United States in exile. In what is now Saskatchewan, he created a Métis provisional government after rising tensions between the West and Ottawa. The creation of this provisional government and their demands for a Métis land is what eventually led to the North-West Rebellion. This rebellion was composed primarily of Métis supporters, but it also had some support from local tribes who had grown resentful of the incursions by settlers onto their lands and who feared that their people would be swallowed by the influx of people from the East. These rebels hoped to gain the support of the powerful Blackfoot nation to defeat the settlers and the coming Canadian Militia.

During the North-West Rebellion Crowfoot removed himself and his people from the fighting for as long as possible. He knew that the rebel fighters were fighting a losing battle, but on the other hand his adopted son Poundmaker was deeply involved in the conflict. Crowfoot was also aware of the fact that the Blackfoot were not treated much better by the Métis who were then fighting the Canadian government.

While the rebellion was ongoing, agents from both sides of the conflict sought to gain the support of the Blackfoot nation. It was mainly due to the respect the warriors of the nation gave Crowfoot that they followed his instruction to not become involved in the fighting.

However, after much debate Crowfoot did choose to back the Crown, though he continued to remain as removed as he could. Despite his agreement with the Crown he allowed Cree refugees into his camp during the rebellion. Due to Crowfoot&#x27;s hesitancy to be involved in the rebellion, the loyalty of the Blackfoot nation was questioned. Crowfoot&#x27;s involvement in the rebellion was centred entirely on his loyalty to the Blackfoot tribe.

==After the rebellion==
At the end of the rebellion Poundmaker was in jail and set to go to trial in Regina. Crowfoot sent Lieutenant Governor Edgar Dewdney a letter asking him to grant Poundmaker a pardon. Crowfoot&#x27;s request was denied, and Poundmaker was found guilty and sentenced to serve three years in a penitentiary. He ended up serving only six months and was released at the request of Dewdney.
Upon being released Poundmaker returned to visit Crowfoot to reconnect with his adopted father. During this visit he died, potentially as a result of his deteriorating health from his prison stay. This devastated Crowfoot as his only healthy son was dead.

The refusal by Crowfoot to provide aid to the rebellion made the Canadian government regard him as a potentially useful ally for negotiating treaties with the Blackfoot and other First Nations. The treaty that was the most important for Crowfoot and the Blackfoot was called Treaty 7.

==Treaty 7==
The main purpose of the treaty from the perspective of the Canadian government was to gain control of the western prairie land and to prevent themselves from being antagonized. They falsely considered Crowfoot to be the leader of the entire Blackfoot Confederation, including the Blood and Northern Piegan, much to the anger of those nations’ respective leaders. Crowfoot thus had a greater reputation as a diplomat than these chiefs and though he always made sure they were consulted in making decisions, he did not feel at all uncomfortable playing the role of supreme commander. Commissioner David Laird promised rations of flour, tea, sugar, tobacco and beef to be provided during negotiations, but Crowfoot, skeptical of their intentions, refused them until he had all the terms of the treaty. In return for allowing White settlers to live on their land, they were offered a secured plot of the land, farming implements, cattle, potatoes, five dollars annually and ammunition.

Crowfoot was levelheaded in his consideration of the offerings in the treaty. He did not want to give up land only to see the white man and the Métis force out and kill the bison. But he was aware that the bison were disappearing and that more settlers from the east were going to inevitably settle, with or without a treaty. As long as the bison were there he knew that farming would not even be an option to his people, but he also knew that they would soon be gone. Overall, he had thought that the terms were generally favourable to his people.

However, there was conflict amongst the band chiefs–One wanted to immediately accept, many were vehemently against signing, and others were still unsure. Before making his executive decision, Crowfoot wanted to talk with Red Crow, leader of the Kainai Nation, who was not yet at the negotiations. While waiting, Crowfoot was pressured heavily from within his circle. Some were desperately in need of the items offered in the treaty and pressed for its immediate signing. Others grew restless and upset with the terms and wanted to launch an attack on the councilmen. When Red Crow finally came, he spent the night with Crowfoot who relayed the terms being offered. He left the next morning to council with the other Blood chiefs.

During his time waiting, Crowfoot counselled with an old medicine man named Pemmican. On his visit with him, he offered the following advice:

 &quot;I want to hold you back because I am at the edge of a bank. My life is at its end. I hold you back because your life henceforth will be very different from what it has been. Buffalo makes your body strong. What you will eat from this money will have your people buried all over these hills. You will be tied down, you will not wander the plains; the whites will take over your land and fill it. You won’t have your own free will; the whites will lead you by a halter. That is why I say don’t sign. But my life is old, so sign if you want to. Go ahead and make the treaty.&quot;

These prophetic words disturbed Crowfoot. Later that same morning, Red Crow returned with his decision on behalf of the Bloods: he would sign if Crowfoot would sign, and since he had been in negotiations longer the final decision was up to him.

That afternoon, on October 21, Crowfoot delivered this speech to his people:

&quot;While I speak, be kind and patient. I have to speak for my people, who are numerous, and who rely upon me to follow that course which in the future will tend to their good. The plains are large and wide. We are the children of the plains, it is our home, and the buffalo has been our food always. I hope you look upon the Blackfeet, Bloods and Sarcees as your children now, and that you will be indulgent and charitable to them. They all expect me to speak now for them, and I trust the Great Spirit will put into their breasts to be a good people – into the minds of the men, women and children, and their future generations.

&quot;The advice given me and my people has proved to be very good. If the police had not come to the country, where would we all be now? Bad men and whisky were killing us so fast that very few, indeed, of us would have been left today. The police have protected us as the feathers of the bird protect it from the frosts of winter. I wish them all good, and trust that all our hearts will increase in goodness from this time forward. I am satisfied. I will sign the treaty.&quot;

==After the treaty==

As time went on, disputes would occur between the First Nations members and Canadian officials over the terms of the treaty. During the fall of 1881, government employees from I. G. Baker Company, who were in charge of supplying the Blackfoot with food, began reducing rations. On two occasions, they ran out of flour and beef, causing starvation. Even when supplies were adequate, they barely satisfied the people&#x27;s hunger, leading to discontent and complaints. As fall began to change to winter, these feelings grew to anger and discontent. Feeling the plight of his people, Crowfoot led two delegations to the farm instructor to plead for more generous rations. Their pleas were not taken seriously, so they resorted to intimidation, threatening the government employees and firing a gun in the direction of the rations house. On another occasion in January 1882, Crowfoot intervened to defend a secondary chief named Bull Elk, who was being wrongly arrested for stealing a steer head from I.G. Baker that he had actually paid for. At this point, Crowfoot denounced the government employees for their mistreatment of the Blackfoot people. He declared that he would turn Bull Elk over when he would receive a fair trial. The I.G. Baker employees had no choice but to agree. But Bull Elk was arbitrarily arrested a second time, enraging the Blackfoot warriors. Crowfoot was also furious, and led these men to confront Superintendent Leif Newry Fitzroy Crozier, the commanding NWMP officer for this area. Crowfoot resisted his temptations to unleash his men on the outnumbered Canadians. He knew that vengeance would be only a temporary satisfaction that would soon turn to despair as the Canadians would return in greater numbers looking to spill blood, just as they done to the Métis under Louis Riel. He sent the men home, and Bull Elk was tried and found not guilty of theft.

Crowfoot&#x27;s decision to refrain from battle proved to be a success, as the scare was enough to prompt Dewdney to make changes. He knew that the Blackfoot people&#x27;s patience could not be tested for much longer, and if no changes were made then bloodshed was inevitable. He oversaw the resignation of Norman Macleod, the agent in charge of the tribes of Treaty 7, and replaced him with Cecil Denny, an NWMP officer stationed at Fort Walsh. Crowfoot was familiar with Denny and knew him as a good man, welcoming the news of his appointment. In February Denny met with Crowfoot and other Blackfoot chiefs to reassess what would be given to the Blackfoot people. He made certain that food supplies were adequate, prohibited the sale of animal parts and meat, and commissioned for farm tools and implements to be brought in and the ploughing of fields once spring came. This initiative by the Canadian government failed to achieve its intended results, as the government agencies responsible did not provide the native communities with the support they needed in the way of tools and supplies to properly feed themselves. The failure of this program was a disaster for the native communities of the plains as it increased their decline as a population due to famine and disease. For Crowfoot specifically, the failure of this program resulted in the deaths of most of his children.

==Legacy of Chief Crowfoot==
Across Canada, there are museums and historical sites like Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump and Blackfoot Crossing Historical Park which commemorate both the Blackfoot nation and specifically Chief Crowfoot. There are also special memorials dedicated to just Crowfoot and his accomplishments. In 2014 at the Blackfoot Historical Crossing Park, a project brought back several artifacts of Chief Crowfoot’s including a deerskin jacket, bow and arrow and pipe. The artifacts were in England at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter and were brought back to Calgary to complete the Crowfoot exhibit.

In 2020, Crowfoot was one of eight finalists for the $5 polymer bills in Canada.

==&quot;The Ballad of Crowfoot&quot;==
Crowfoot was the subject of a ten-minute 1968 National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;The Ballad of Crowfoot&quot;, directed by Willie Dunn. The film explores the situation of aboriginal people in North America through the story of Crowfoot, featuring a montage of archival photographs, etchings, and newspaper clippings, set against a ballad by Dunn, a Mi&#x27;kmaq singer and songwriter. Produced through the Indian Film Crew program, it was the first NFB film by an Indigenous director, and received several awards including a Gold Hugo for best short film at the 1969 Chicago International Film Festival.

&quot;The Ballad of Crowfoot&quot; has sometimes been credited as the first known Canadian music video.

<doc id="1231256" wikidata="Q1756844" url="?curid=1231256" title="The Louvin Brothers">
<text>The Louvin Brothers were an American musical duo composed of brothers Ira and Charlie Louvin (&quot;né&quot; Loudermilk). The brothers are cousins to John D. Loudermilk, a Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame member.

The brothers wrote and performed country, bluegrass, and gospel music. Ira played mandolin and generally sang lead vocal in the tenor range, while Charlie played rhythm guitar and offered supporting vocals in a lower pitch. They helped popularize the vocal technique of close harmony in country and country-rock.
After becoming regulars at the Grand Ole Opry and scoring a string of hit singles in the late 1950s and early &#x27;60s, the Louvin Brothers broke up in 1963 due in large part to Charlie growing tired of Ira&#x27;s addictions and reckless behavior. Ira died in a traffic accident in 1965. They were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001, and Charlie died of cancer in 2011. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the Louvin Brothers number four on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.

==Background==
Brothers Ira (April 21, 1924 – June 20, 1965) and Charlie (July 7, 1927 – January 26, 2011) Louvin (&quot;né&quot; Loudermilk) adopted the name Louvin Brothers in the 1940s as they began their career in gospel music. They grew up listening to and singing shape note music, which influenced the rest of their musical output. Their first foray into secular music was the minor hit &quot;The Get Acquainted Waltz&quot;, recorded with Chet Atkins. Their other hits include &quot;Cash on the Barrelhead&quot; and &quot;When I Stop Dreaming&quot;. They joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and stayed there until breaking up in 1963.

Their songs were heavily influenced by their Baptist faith and warned against sin. Nevertheless, Ira Louvin was notorious for his drinking, womanizing, and volcanic temper. He was married four times; his third wife Faye shot him four times in the chest and twice in the hand after he allegedly tried to strangle her with a telephone cord. Although seriously injured, he survived. When performing and drinking, Ira would sometimes become angry enough on stage to smash his mandolin when he was unable to tune it, and - when sober - glue it back together. His style was heavily influenced by Bill Monroe, and his brother Charlie Monroe, who had a tempestuous relationship with Ira, considered him one of the top mandolin players in Nashville.

In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review of Charlie&#x27;s biography &quot;Satan Is Real&quot;, Alex Abramovich said, &quot;Ira Louvin was a full head taller than his younger brother, played the mandolin like Bill Monroe, and sang in an impossibly high, tense, quivering tenor. Charlie strummed a guitar, grinned like a vaudevillian, and handled the bottom register. But every so often, in the middle of a song, some hidden signal flashed and the brothers switched places — with Ira swooping down from the heights, and Charlie angling upward — and even the most careful listeners would lose track of which man was carrying the lead. This was more than close-harmony singing; each instance was an act of transubstantiation.&quot;

In 1963, fed up with Ira&#x27;s drinking and abusive behavior, Charlie started a solo career, and Ira also went on his own.

Ira died on June 20, 1965, at the age of 41. His fourth wife, Anne Young, and he were on the way home from a performance in Kansas City when they came to a section of construction on Highway 70 outside of Williamsburg, Missouri, where traffic had been reduced down to one lane. A drunken driver struck their car head-on, and both Ira and Anne were killed instantly. At the time, a warrant for Ira&#x27;s arrest had been issued on a DUI charge.

Charlie died of pancreatic cancer on January 26, 2011, at age 83.

==Legacy==
Country-rock band The Byrds recorded the Louvin-penned &quot;The Christian Life&quot; for their 1968 release &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;.

Emmylou Harris had a hit with the brothers&#x27; tune &quot;If I Could Only Win Your Love&quot; in 1975. Her cover version reached number four on the &quot;Billboard &quot;Hot Country Singles chart and earned the top spot on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada.

In 2001, the Louvin Brothers were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. The tribute CD &quot;Livin&#x27;, Lovin&#x27;, Losin&#x27;: Songs of the Louvin Brothers&quot;, produced by Carl Jackson and Kathy Louvin and released in 2003, won the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Country Album.

===&quot;Satan Is Real&quot; album===

Although the brothers are still remembered today for their musical talent, they are also remembered for the unusual cover used for their 1959 album, &quot;Satan Is Real&quot;. Designed by Ira Louvin, the cover features the brothers standing in a rock quarry in front of a plywood rendition of the Devil as several hidden tires soaked in kerosene burn behind them as fire and brimstone. Some reviewers count this as being one of the &quot;greatest iconic album covers of all time.&quot;

The opening bars of the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Satan Is Real&quot; can be heard at the beginning of Hank Williams III&#x27;s &quot;Medley: Straight to Hell / Satan Is Real&quot;, on his &quot;Straight to Hell&quot; album of 2006. It is also excerpted in Will Ferrell&#x27;s 2009 one-man Broadway show, &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome America. A Final Night With George W Bush.&quot;

<text>Carrie &amp; Barry is a British television sitcom first broadcast on BBC One between 2004 and 2005. Written by Simon Nye, it stars Neil Morrissey and Claire Rushbrook.

Produced by Hartswood Films, it reunited Morrissey with writer Simon Nye, executive producer Beryl Vertue and director Martin Dennis. It was produced by Sue Vertue.

Neil Morrissey plays part-time taxi driver Barry and Claire Rushbrook is his beautician wife Carrie. The couple find themselves with the daily challenges of keeping the spice in their marriage and the fun in their day jobs – as well as having to deal with Barry&#x27;s teenage daughter Sinéad (Sarah Quintrell) from his disastrous first marriage. In an interview for Best magazine in 2012 Neil Morrissey stated that this role remains the one role of which he is the most proud.

Mark Williams plays Barry&#x27;s mate Kirk, who co-owns his black cab (he does the night shifts) whilst Michelle Gomez is Carrie&#x27;s acid-tongued best friend and fellow beautician Michelle.

<doc id="1231267" wikidata="Q716390" url="?curid=1231267" title="Cluj-Napoca Bánffy Palace">
<text>Bánffy Castle is a baroque building of the 18th century in Cluj-Napoca, designed by the German architect Johann Eberhard Blaumann. Built between 1774 and 1775 it is considered the most representative for the baroque style of Transylvania. The first owner of the palace was the Hungarian Duke György Bánffy (1746–1822), the governor of Transylvania.

Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor and his wife Caroline Augusta of Bavaria were hosted in the palace during their visit in Kolozsvár, between 18 and 27 August 1817. This was the first occasion when a ruler from the Habsburg family visited the city. Franz Joseph I of Austria was also the guest of the palace between 2-4. August 1852 and 22–24 September 1887. The palace (along with the Răscruci castle of the Bánffy family) features in the reminiscences of an English governess, Florence Tarring, who worked for one of the branches of the Bánffy family during the First World War (1914–1919).

In February 1951 the council of the city decided to empty the palace to establish an Art Museum there; the works were finished in the summer of 1954. The museum was opened in the restored palace on 30 December 1965. The cinema occupying the inner yard of the palace was demolished in 1974.

The floor area of the palace is 66×48 m, its inner yard is 26×26 m. The wings on the sides include one row of rooms while the front and back wing includes two rows. The yard is surrounded by a portico at the second-floor level.

The facade is decorated with statues of Mars, Minerva, Apollo, Diana, Hercules, Perseus, and the coat of arms of the Bánffy family with gryphons, without crown. In the median risalit there is a gate, above this is a loggia with seven pillars.

==Art museum==
Since 1951, the palace has housed the National Museum of Art Cluj-Napoca, which includes, in its Virgil Cioflec collection the works of arts of many important Romanian artists, such as Nicolae Grigorescu, Ştefan Luchian, Dimitrie Paciurea, Theodor Pallady, Camil Ressu and others. The museum also includes works by noted Hungarian artists József Koszta, Károly Lotz, László Mednyánszky, Mihály Munkácsy, Béla Nagy Abodi and István Réti. The international collection features paintings of major European artists like Luca Giordano, Carlo Dolci, Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, Félix Ziem, Ivan Aivazovsky, Herri met de Bles, and Franz Defregger, as well as sculptures of Claude Michel, Antoine-Louis Barye and Ernst Barlach. The graphics collection includes works of great European printmakers of the 16th-20th centuries. Among those, the museum hosts the works of Salvator Rosa, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Honoré Daumier, Théodore Géricault, Edgar Degas and Käthe Kollwitz.

<doc id="1231274" wikidata="Q707775" url="?curid=1231274" title="Mwanga II of Buganda">
<text>Danieri Basammula-Ekkere Mwanga II Mukasa (1868 – 8 May 1903) was the 31st Kabaka of Buganda who ruled from 1884 until 1888 and from 1889 until 1897.

== Claim to the throne ==
He was born at Nakawa on 3 June 1868. His father was Muteesa I of Buganda, who reigned between 1856 and 1884. His mother was &quot;Abakyala&quot; Abisagi Bagalayaze, the 10th of his father&#x27;s 85 wives. He ascended to the throne on 18 October 1884, after the death of his father. He established his capital on Mengo Hill.
==Reign==
Mwanga came to the throne at the age of 16. He increasingly regarded the greatest threat to his rule as coming from the Christian missionaries who had gradually penetrated Buganda. His father had played-off the three religious traditions – Catholics, Protestants, and Muslims – against each other and thus had balanced the influence of the powers that were backing each group in order to extend their reach into Africa. Mwanga II took a much more aggressive approach.

On his orders, the Uganda Martyrs, a group of 22 Catholic and 23 Anglican converts to Christianity in the kingdom of Buganda, now part of Uganda, were executed between 31 January 1885 and 27 January 1887. The deaths took place at a time when there was a three-way religious struggle for political influence at the Buganda royal court. The episode also occurred against the backdrop of the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot; – the invasion, occupation, division, colonization and annexation of African territory by European powers.

These murders and Mwanga&#x27;s continued resistance alarmed the British, who backed a rebellion by Christian and Muslim groups who supported Mwanga&#x27;s half brother and defeated Mwanga at Mengo in 1888. Mwanga&#x27;s brother, Kiweewa Nnyonyintono, was elevated to the throne. He lasted exactly one month and was replaced on the throne by another brother, Kabaka Kalema Muguluma. However, Mwanga escaped and negotiated with the British. In exchange for handing over some of his sovereignty to the British East Africa Company, the British changed their backing to Mwanga, who swiftly removed Kalema from the throne in 1889. Mwanga later converted to Christianity and was baptized as a Protestant.

==Final years==
On 26 December 1890, Mwanga was to sign a treaty with Lord Lugard, granting certain powers over revenue, trade and the administration of justice to the Imperial British East Africa Company. These powers were transferred to the crown on 1 April 1893.

On 27 August 1894, Mwanga was forced accept Buganda becoming a Protectorate. As a result, on 6 July 1897, he declared an anti-colonial war on the British and launched an attack but was defeated on 20 July 1897, in Buddu (in today&#x27;s Masaka District). He fled into German East Africa (modern-day Tanzania), where he was arrested and interned at Bukoba.

He was deposed &quot;&quot; on 9 August 1897. Tenacious and anti-imperialist as he was, he escaped and returned to Buganda with a revolutionary army that was determined to free Buganda of colonial influence, but was again defeated on 15 January 1898. He was captured, tortured and in April 1899 was exiled to the Seychelles. While in exile, he was coerced into the Anglican Church by way of forced baptism and was given the name Danieri (Daniel). He spent the rest of his life in exile but his anti-imperialist resolve was never broken. He remained deeply resentful about the conquest of his own people by the British and urged them to keep up the struggle against a European rule. He died in the Seychelles on 8 May 1903, aged 34 or 35 as a result of torture by British soldiers and starvation. On 2 August 1910, his remains were repatriated and buried at Kasubi.

==Married life==
Mwanga is on record as having married 17 wives:
# Damali Bayita Nanjobe
# Naabakyaala Dolosi Mwaan&#x27;omu Bakazikubawa
# Esiteri Nabunnya
# Naabakyaala Eveliini Kulabako, Omubikka
# Naabakyaala Loyiroosa Nakibuuka, Kaddulubaale
# Naabakyaala Samali Namuwanga, Sabaddu
# Nabweteme
# Nakijoba Nabulya (Elizabeeti Oliva Kyebuzibwa born of Mwanje Bikaali)
# Bezza Batwegombya
# Naabakyaala Ntongo, Kabejja
# Naabakyaala Nabisubi, Omuwanga
# Namirembe
# Lakeeri Mbekeka
# Nalwooga, Omuyigiriza
# Elizaabeeti Buteba
# Nattimba Binti Juma
# Amalemba Tutsi

==Issue==
Mwanga II fathered several sons and daughters from his 16 wives including Daudi Chwa II of Buganda:

# Prince (&quot;Omulangira&quot;) Kagolo, whose mother was Damali Bayita Nanjobe. He was killed by his uncle Kalema, in 1889.

# Prince (&quot;Omulangira&quot;) Nganda, whose mother was Lakeeri Mbekeka

# Daudi Chwa II of Buganda, who reigned from 1897 until 1939. His mother was Eveliini Kulabako.
# Prince (&quot;Omulangira&quot;) Yusuufu Suuna Kiweewa, whose mother was Esiteri Nabunnya. He was born at Mengo, Uganda on 16 February 1898 and was educated at Mengo High School and King&#x27;s College Budo. Commissioned 2nd Lieutenant in October 1914. He served in the Great War from 1915 until 1919. Promoted to Lieutenant in the 7th Territorial Battalion on 25 May 1939. He served in the Second World War in Eastern Africa and in North Africa, from 1939 until 1940. Retired on 18 March 1940. He was implicated in the Buganda riots of 1949 and exiled to the Ssese Islands, where he died in 1949.
# Prince (&quot;Omulangira&quot;) Tobi, whose mother was Nabisubi
# Prince (&quot;Omulangira&quot;) Nayime?, whose mother was Loyiroosa Nakibuuka

==Quotes==

&quot;I do not want to give them my land. I want all Europeans of all nations to come to Buganda, to build and to trade as they like.&quot;
* Mwanga&#x27;s message to Euan Smith, British Consul in Zanzibar, 1890

&quot;I am Mutesa&#x27;s son, and what Mutesa was in Buganda that I will also be, and against those who will not have it so I shall make war.&quot;
* Mwanga to Karl Peters, 1890

&quot;The English have come; they have built a fort; they eat my land; they have made me sign a treaty; they curtail my powers; and I get nothing from them in return.&quot;
* Mwanga after signing treaty with Captain Frederick Lugard, 1890

&quot;Abalangira timba buli afuluma amira munne.&quot; [Princes are like pythons they swallow each other.]
* Mwanga after defeating the Muslim faction, 1893

&quot;When I die it will be the end of the kingdom of Buganda. Europeans will take over (eat) this country of mine.&quot;
* Mwanga before joining forces with Kabalega, 1898

=== Quotes about Mwanga II ===
&quot;To his (Mwanga&#x27;s) distorted view the missionaries were men banded together for the undermining of his authority, for sapping the affections and loyalty of his subjects and for ultimately occupying the whole of Buganda.&quot;
* Henry Morton Stanley, &quot;In Darkest Africa&quot;, 1890

&quot;... there was, however, much good feeling and even tenderness in his character when he could be kept from bad habits and was free from evil influences.&quot;
* John Roscoe, &quot;Twenty Five Years in East Africa&quot;, 1921

&quot;Mwanga was a jovial, friendly person who had many friends.&quot;
* Batolomewo Zimbe, &quot;Buganda ne Kabaka&quot;, 1939, p. 53.

&quot;Mwanga fought to free himself and his country of the intruders for all his reign. He did not like or want them; he was impressed by their power, but not interested in their ideas. He could not recover the old way of life nor adapt himself to the new, and in his perplexed and unhappy groping in the gap between he seems to me to deserve some sympathy.&quot;
* Kabaka Mutesa II, &quot;Desecration of My Kingdom&quot;, 1967

&quot;He had wanted to be master in his own house, but unfortunately for him and for the monarchy, chieftainship triumphed over royal authority in a manner that had never happened before.&quot;
* MSM Kiwanuka, &quot;Kabaka Mwanga and His Political Parties&quot;, 1969

&quot;When Mwanga was brought to the capital as a captive the administration expected the people to be happy now that the enemy of their peace and religion was going into exile. On the contrary, people wanted him pardoned.&quot;
* Fr. John-Mary Waliggo, The Catholic Church in Buddu, 1976

&quot;Mwanga ... was demonstrably unequal to the task of controlling the foreigners who were subverting his kingdom under his very nose. He did not have the experience or the prestige that had enabled his father to keep foreigners in their place within his kingdom.&quot;
* Samwiri R. Karugire, &quot;A Political History of Uganda&quot;, 1980

&quot;Mwanga was quite right to seek to be the master in his own kingdom just as his forefathers had been, all his excesses and fault of character notwithstanding. Some of his predecessors had been guilty of worse acts of cruelty and injustice and nothing drastic had befallen them. In other words even if all the charges levelled against Mwanga by his numerous Christian and Muslim detractors were true, he was still right to claim supreme authority in the kingdom of his forefathers.&quot;
* Samwiri R. Karugire, &quot;A Political History of Uganda&quot;, 1980

&quot;... Mwanga struck them (Ganda elders) as being kinder and gentler than Mutesa had been while a youth. For sheer tyranny, Mwanga II was easily outclassed by his father, grandfather and great grandfather, each of whom was remembered in Ganda tradition at the time of the British colonial take-over as having become uncontrollable at some stage during their respective reigns. This is something Mwanga never became.&quot;
* Morris Twaddle, &quot;Kakungulu&quot;, 1993

&quot;No Kabaka of Buganda had ever faced the challenges that Mwanga faced, dealing with mighty religious parties which eventually drove him from the throne and his kingdom.&quot;
* Samwiri Lwanga Lunyigo, &quot;Mwanga II&quot;, 2011, page 4

&quot;Mwanga II should be judged within the context of nineteenth century Buganda, where kings had absolute executive, legislative, judicial, military and even economic power. To see him through the lenses of his foes, those who took away the sovereignty of his country and their local collaborators is to miss him. He cannot be understood through the fairy tales of his enemies who denounced him.&quot;
* Samwiri Lwanga Lunyigo, &quot;Mwanga II&quot;, 2011, p. 35



== Social media trend ==
In early 2023, a social media trend emerged in Uganda and worldwide, featuring the name &#x27;Kabaka-Mwanga.&#x27; The trend originated from a video shared on Ugandan social media platforms, in which a young boy from the suburbs of Uganda used the phrase as an exclamatory statement. This trend sparked renewed interest in the historical figure of Mwanga. The phenomenon captured the attention of both older Ugandans familiar with Mwanga&#x27;s legacy and younger generations who were previously unaware of him.

<text>Stephen Geoffrey Thompson MBE (formerly Steve Walter; born 15 July 1978) is a former rugby union player who played at hooker for Northampton Saints and England. He was once England&#x27;s most capped hooker and played for the British &amp; Irish Lions.

==Club career==
===Northampton Saints===
Formerly Steve Walter, born 15 July 1978 in Hemel Hempstead, he started playing rugby at 15 at the Northampton School for Boys and Northampton Casuals rugby club, Steve went on to play for Northampton Old Scouts alongside Ben Cohen in a youth team. He also trained with the youth section of Saints and, at 18, was selected for the apprentice scheme at the club&#x27;s academy as a back row forward. Former Saints coach Ian McGeechan and coaches at the Northampton academy persuaded him to convert to being a hooker. Despite competing against the Argentinian Federico Méndez in the 1999–2000 season for his club place, he still managed to force his way into the England A squad. Thompson continued to develop as a player and became co-captain of Northampton Saints. At Northampton he was a replacement in the victorious 2000 Heineken Cup Final as they defeated Munster.

===Retirement and return with Brive===
On 15 April 2007 Thompson announced his immediate retirement from rugby due to a neck injury that he had suffered during the closing Heineken Cup pool match against Biarritz at Franklin&#x27;s Gardens in January 2007.

For the 2007/2008 season he signed for CA Brive as a &quot;recruitment and technique adviser&quot;. But on 22 October 2007, Thompson announced he would be returning to the game after consulting medical staff. He first played (and won) with Brive on 9 November 2007 in the European Challenge Cup against Connacht. Thompson represented the club in three Top 14 campaigns.

===Back in the Premiership===
On 31 May 2010 Thompson finally agreed a 2-year deal with Leeds Carnegie after a lot of speculation. This saw him join up with former International teammate Neil Back who was head coach at Leeds.
Leeds were relegated from the 2010–11 Aviva Premiership. On 1 May 2011 it was announced that he had signed a 3-year deal with London Wasps. However, on 3 December 2011 Thompson announced his immediate retirement from the game, following a recurrence of a serious neck injury sustained in Wasps&#x27; training in late October, which required surgery to relieve symptoms of numbness and dizziness. Continuing to play would have been a serious health risk.

==International career==
Thompson was selected for England&#x27;s summer tour to North America in 2001, where he did well. He made his test debut for England in the 2002 Six Nations with a win against Scotland. He scored his maiden test try against Italy in the 2003 Six Nations, a tournament which saw England win the Grand Slam. Thompson made a significant contribution to England&#x27;s southern hemisphere tour in June 2003, playing in both victorious tests against New Zealand and Australia.

He was a member of the England team that won the 2003 Rugby World Cup, playing a part in all but one of England&#x27;s World Cup performances in Australia. He scored his second test try in England&#x27;s opening World Cup match against Georgia in Perth.

Thompson continued as an England regular in the Autumn games of 2004. He was selected for the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand; on the tour he seemed to have regained some of his form after a poor 2005 Six Nations.

On 19 May 2009 Martin Johnson gave Thompson a surprise call up for England&#x27;s summer games against The Barbarians and Argentina. Thompson was recalled to the England squad for the 2009 autumn internationals along with 2003 world cup winners Jonny Wilkinson and Lewis Moody.

In the 2011 Six Nations he scored the only try for England in their match against Ireland on 19 March 2011, a tournament which saw England win the Six Nations, but were denied the Grand Slam and Triple Crown with defeat to Ireland in Dublin. He also played in England&#x27;s 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign, and was one of a minority of players whose reputation did not suffer.

==Post-retirement==
Thompson has been based in Dubai and has acted as an ambassador for the Christina Noble Children&#x27;s Foundation. He has also been appointed as sports ambassador for security and facilities management services company Transguard, and worked in the media as rugby analyst for OSN and ESPN (UK).

==Health and dementia==
In December 2020, Thompson, aged 42, revealed that he had been diagnosed with early onset dementia with probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is caused by repeated blows to the head (CTE can only be confirmed by post-mortem dissection of the brain). He said that he has no memory at all of events such as winning the 2003 Rugby World Cup and sometimes forgets his wife&#x27;s name. He has also said he would not play rugby again, and would not like his son to take up rugby &quot;the way it is at the moment&quot;.

Thompson and seven other players under 45 with a similar diagnosis were proposing to take legal action against World Rugby for failing to protect them.

On 23 September 2021, Thompson announced that he had decided to donate his brain for CTE research.

<text>Benson Records was founded by Bob Benson and John T. Benson, who formed the John T. Benson Music Publishing Company in 1902. The record label started out as Heart Warming Records, creating house labels such as Impact Records, Greentree Records, RiverSong, StarSong, Power Discs and Home Sweet Home. In the 1970s, Impact became the top label with artists such as New Dawn, the Imperials, J.D. Sumner &amp; The Stamps Quartet, the Rambos, Dottie Rambo, the Archers, the Bill Gaither Trio, the Speer Family and Sandi Patty (her Impact catalog is owned by Curb Music).

== History ==
In 1980, Paragon Associates formed a partnership with Zondervan to own/operate Benson Records. Paragon Assoc. was founded in 1975, by Bob MacKenzie and Bill Gaither (gospel singer). Paragon sold its interest to Zondervan in 1983, where under the leadership of Bob Jones, Jr. saw the Benson company grow even bigger in the 1980s. Artists included Gold City, The Kingsmen Quartet, DeGarmo &amp; Key, Dallas Holm, and others producing several hits.

In the 1980s, Benson Records continued with success by signing a contract to distribute a new label, founded by Dan R. Brock, Eddie DeGarmo, Dana Key and Ron W. Griffin. Forefront Records was born, and in 1989 Dc Talk was signed. In 1996, Forefront Records was sold to EMI (now Universal Music Group); this acquisition includes the entire DeGarmo &amp; Key catalog. On July 27, 1993, Benson Music Group launched the Christian children&#x27;s music series, &quot;Kids&#x27; Classics&quot; with the first six titles including Bible Songs, Action Bible Songs, Sunday School Songs, Songs of Praise, Silly Songs, and Lullabies. In 1994, the name Impact Records was sold to Landmark Distribution. On July 26, 1994, Benson Music Group released two new &quot;Kids&#x27; Classics&quot; including Toddler Tunes and Hymns. On November 1, 1994, &quot;Kids&#x27; Classics&quot; changed their name to &quot;Cedarmont Kids&quot;. In 1995, they acquired Diadem Music Group which included gospel-jazz pioneer Ben Tankard&#x27;s Tribute Records label contracts. These contracts included Tankard, Yolanda Adams, Twinkie Clark and Bob Carlisle. Carlisle is best known for his hit song, &quot;Butterfly Kisses&quot;.

Benson Records was sold to Provident/Zomba in 1997, which is now a part of Sony Music Entertainment. The Benson label was reformatted to focus on new artists. Zomba closed the label in late 2001.

Most recently, the name Heart Warming Records and RiverSong was sold to Homeland Entertainment. Homeland is owned by Bill Traylor and former President of Zondervan, Bob Jones, Jr.

Benson&#x27;s choral music printing business is now owned by the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, whose Celebrating Grace subsidiary acquired its assets from Universal Music Group..

<doc id="1231296" wikidata="Q1615387" url="?curid=1231296" title="Battle of Punta Quemada">
<text>The Battle of Punta Quemada, fought sometime in January 1525, was a brief encounter between a band of Spanish conquistadors and the &quot;warlike natives&quot; of Colombia, thought to be a northern tributary tribe to the Andean Kingdom of Quito, subordinate to and as well northern capital of the Inca Empire. Though it marked the end of Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s first tentative expedition along the Pacific coast, the battle also represented a crucial step to Spain&#x27;s discovery and conquest of the Peru.

For weeks before their landfall at Punta Quemada, Pizarro and his company had, both on sea and on land, steadily crawled southward along the coast of Colombia, enduring both the inhospitality of the terrain and the dangers of tropical tempests. Famine and fatigue alike had ravaged the group, leaving several dead and many on the brink of incapacitation, and only Pizarro&#x27;s personal charisma and the iron constitution of the Castilians had kept the crew from collapsing into mutiny and despair.

Upon reaching Punta Quemada, Pizarro, leading his men inland along unusually agreeable terrain, had discovered and occupied a large native village, the residents of which, to all appearances, had fled in terror at the sight of the Europeans. Delighted at the luck of having established quarters in such a defensible position, and mindful that his battered vessel out on the shore would not carry him much farther, Pizarro elected to send a contingent of men under Lieutenant Montenegro back to Panama for repairs and supplies while his own troops manned the village ramparts and awaited the arrival of Diego de Almagro, whose own expeditionary force, following the path of Pizarro&#x27;s, was bound to arrive shortly.

But the Quitians were warriors and, contrary to Spanish assessment, had abandoned their settlement only to see their women and children to safety. Armed with bows, slings, and spears, they had closely monitored the invaders and gathered unseen in the jungle in preparation for an attack.

Montenegro&#x27;s column, the more vulnerable of the two Castilian parties, fell into a Quitian ambush just as it emerged from the heavy jungle foliage onto Andean foothills where arrows and other projectiles could fly unobstructed. A volley of arrows and stones struck the Spaniards. The Castilians began to fall back in panic and disarray as the natives bore down upon them.

Montenegro, rallying his men, ordered a return volley at the onrushing Quitians. The Spaniards shredded the native charge with a flurry of crossbow bolts, then countercharged, driving the unarmoured Quitians back.
The Quitians orchestrated a similar assault on Pizarro&#x27;s camp and stormed the village, unleashing a shower of missiles at the defenders. Prescott recounts that Pizarro, too bold and fiery of temper to be held inside a set of walls by enemy fire, sallied out to meet the threat, rousing his men into a charge that drove the natives back. However, the natives counterattacked, and the Spanish troops faltered.

Montenegro, fearing for his leader, had ordered an immediate march back to camp. He now appeared at the edge of the ridge and drove into the rear of the Quitian formations, shattering their resolve. Unable to resist this new threat, the natives fled into the jungle, leaving Pizarro wounded in no less than seven places.

The conquistadors realized that the village was far less defensible than they had previously assumed, and fearing subsequent hostile encounters and unable to continue south by sea, Pizarro chose to end his expedition at Punta Quemada.

Almagro, following in Pizarro&#x27;s footsteps, later attacked and burned the village, losing an eye in the process.

<text>The Mayor of Bucharest (), sometimes known as the General Mayor, is the head of the Bucharest City Hall in Bucharest, Romania, which is responsible for citywide affairs, such as the water system, the transport system and the main boulevards. The title of General Mayor is sometimes used to distinguish the office from that of the mayors that lead each of Bucharest&#x27;s six administrative sectors, and which are responsible for local area affairs, such as secondary streets, parks, schools and cleaning services. All decisions of the mayor have to be approved by the 55-seat General Council of Bucharest.

The office was created on 7 August 1864, when a new French-style local administration law was adopted.

The two before last elections saw Sorin Oprescu elected as Mayor of Bucharest, for the first time in June 2008 and afterwards for a second term in June 2012. On 6 September 2015, Sorin Oprescu was detained on suspicion of corruption and bribery charges.

On 15 September 2015, he was replaced by a general council elected deputy-mayor for the remainder of his term which ended the following year.

On 5 June 2016, Gabriela Firea was elected Mayor with 246,553 votes (42.97%) and she was sworn in on 23 June.

On 27 September 2020, Nicușor Dan was elected Mayor and he was sworn in on 29 October.

On 9 June 2024, Dan was re-elected as Mayor of Bucharest and is expected to begin his new term in October, planning to focus more on the traffic problems of Bucharest, while renewing public transport still remains one of his priorities.

The Senate ({{langx|ro|Senat}}) is the upper house in the bicameral Parliament of Romania. It has 136 seats (before the 2016 parliamentary election the total number of elected representatives was 176), to which members are elected by direct popular vote using party-list proportional representation in 43 electoral districts (the 41 counties, the city of Bucharest plus 1 constituency for the Romanians living abroad), to serve four-year terms.

==History==

=== First Senate (1859–1944) ===

The parliamentary history of Romania is seen as beginning in May 1831 in Wallachia, where a constitution called Regulamentul Organic (&quot;Organic Statute&quot;) was promulgated by the Russian Empire and adopted. In January 1832 it came into force in Moldavia also. This laid the foundations for the parliamentary institution in the two Romanian principalities. At the Congress of Paris of 1856, Russia gave up to Moldavia the left bank of the mouth of the Danube, including part of Bessarabia, and also gave up its claim to be the protector of Christians in the Ottoman Empire. Moldavia and Wallachia, while remaining under the suzerainty of the Ottomans, were recognized as quasi-independent self-governing principalities under the protection of the other European Powers.

The Paris Convention of 19 August 1858 promulgated &quot;Statutul Dezvoltător&quot; (&quot;Expanding Statute&quot;), to introduce a bicameral parliament, with an upper house named in Romanian &quot;Corpul Ponderator&quot; (&quot;Moderating Body&quot;). This was later renamed the &quot;Senat&quot;. A formal Union of the two principalities came in 1859. On the initiative of Alexandru Ioan Cuza, a plebiscite in 1864 enlarged the principle of national representation.

The 1866 Constitution of Romania proclaimed constitutional monarchy as Romania&#x27;s form of government, on the basis of national sovereignty and the separation of powers. Legislative power was to be exercised by the new Prince (Carol I of Romania) and a bi-cameral parliament, with an Assembly of Deputies and a Senate.

On 9 May 1877, the Declaration of Romania&#x27;s independence was read under the dome of the Romanian Parliament.

The 1923 Constitution, approved by both houses of parliament in May 1923, again entrusted legislative power to the Senate, the Assembly of Deputies, and the King. The constitution instituted the membership by right (&quot;senator de drept&quot;) in the Senate for:
* The heir to the throne;
* Metropolitan bishops and diocesan bishops of the Orthodox and Greek-Catholic churches;
* Heads of state-recognised religious bodies;
* The president of the Romanian Academy;
* Former presidents of the Council of Ministers;
* Former ministers with at least six years&#x27; seniority;
* Former presidents of either legislative chamber who held this function for at least eight ordinary sessions;
* Former senators and deputies elected to at least ten legislatures, irrespective of their duration;
* Former presidents of the High Court of Cassation and Justice;
* Reserve and retired generals;
* Former presidents of the National Assemblies at Chișinău, Cernăuți, and Alba Iulia, which previously proclaimed their respective provinces&#x27; union with Romania in 1918 (&quot;see Union of Transylvania with Romania, Union of Bessarabia with Romania&quot;).

Additionally, the Senate included an elective element, chosen by corporatist electoral colleges, including the chambers of commerce, industry, and agriculture, as well as university professors.

In February 1938, amid the political crisis which soon led to the Second World War, King Carol II imposed a more authoritarian monarchy. Under the Constitution of 1938, Parliament lost some of its main powers. The Senate was to be composed of members appointed by the King, members by right, and members elected in single-member electoral areas, in the same manner as Assembly members. The proportion of appointed and elected members was to be equal, while senators by right still had to meet the conditions set out in the 1923 Constitution.

=== Suspension and abolition (1940–1944) ===

In September 1940, after the abdication of King Carol, the National Legionary State suspended the parliament but itself lasted less than five months. It was succeeded by Ion Antonescu&#x27;s military dictatorship and the parliament remained suspended.

After the royal coup of 23 August 1944, on 15 July 1946 the government controlled by the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) issued an electoral law that re-organized the parliament as a single legislative body, called the Assembly of Deputies, thus disestablishing the Senate. Under the 1948 constitution this became the Great National Assembly, a relatively impotent body subordinate to the power of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR).

=== Senate recreated (1990) ===

The Romanian Revolution of 1989 opened the way to restoring pluralistic representative democracy. Under the country&#x27;s new post-communist Constitution of 1991, approved by a national referendum in 1991, Romania returned to a bicameral parliamentary system, in which the Senate is an elected body.

A referendum on modifying the size and structure of the Parliament from the current bicameral one with 137 senators and 334 deputies to a unicameral one with a maximum of 300 seats was held on 22 November 2009, at the same time as the first round of the 2009 presidential election. The electors approved by a percentage of 77.78% (50.95% turnout) the adoption of a unicameral Parliament, however as of {{currentyear}} the necessary constitutional changes to achieve this have not been put into effect.

==Former locations==
The first Romanian Senate functioned between 1864 and 1869 in a small building, which still exists today on the Calea Șerban Vodă. Once the new building of the University of Bucharest was inaugurated, the Senate moved in a bigger hall in that building. Between 1929 and 1940, it was temporarily housed in a building on the Regina Elisabeta Boulevard, while a new Palace of the Senate was to be built in today&#x27;s Națiunile Unite Square. This building was never finished.

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the Senate was housed in the &quot;Palace of the Senate&quot; ({{langx|ro|Palatul Senatului}}), located in Revolution Square. That U-shaped structure was built from 1938 to 1941 under engineer {{ill|Emil Prager|ro}}&#x27;s coordination, following the plans of architect Emil Nădejde. It housed the Council of Ministers and from 1958 to 1989 it was the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). During the Revolution, Romanian President Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena fled by helicopter from the roof of the building. In 2005 the senators moved into the Palace of the Parliament, joining their colleagues from the Chamber of Deputies. &quot;Palatul Senatului&quot; now houses the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

{{Empty section|date=March 2022}}

===2008–2012===
{{Main|2008–2012 legislature of the Romanian Parliament}}
In December 2008, the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL) and the political alliance established between the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and Conservative Party (PC) formed a coalition government.
{{#section:2008–2012 legislature of the Romanian Parliament|Senate}}

===2004–2008===
{{Main|2004–2008 legislature of the Romanian Parliament}}

In the 2004 Romanian general election, held on 28 November 2004, the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA) won the greatest number of seats, even though no party won an outright majority. The President of the Senate for this legislature was Nicolae Văcăroiu, who was elected on 20 December 2004. Following his &quot;ad interim&quot; presidency of Romania, he delegated his attributions to the vice president Doru Ioan Tărăcilă. After Văcăroiu was sworn in as president of the Court of Accounts, Ilie Sârbu was elected as the new President of the Senate.

Until April 2007, the Justice and Truth Alliance governed in coalition with other minor parties. In April 2007, after the break-up of the Justice and Truth Alliance, the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians (UDMR/RMDSZ) formed a minority government coalition (highlighted in bold in the table below).

=== 2000–2004 ===

Elections to the Senate were held on 26 November 2000, in which the Social Democratic Party (then abbreviated PDSR) won an overall majority. Then President of the Senate of Romania was former Prime Minister (between 1992 and 1996) Nicolae Văcăroiu, who was elected in December 2000. The allocation of seats was as follows:

== Presidents of the Senate (1990–present) ==
{{main|President of the Senate of Romania}}

The Standing Bureau of the Senate consists of the President of the Senate, four vice-presidents, four secretaries, and four quaestors. The President of the Standing Bureau also serves as the President of the Senate. The President is elected, by secret ballot, for the duration of the legislative period.

The political stance of the presidents of the upper house of the Parliament of Romania (after the development of a modern party system) is given by the following legend table:

Ad interim (acting) officeholders are denoted by &quot;italics&quot;. The Rule of the Senate states that at the first standing of the house, the meeting is headed by the eldest senator and helped by the youngest senator. Those bear the title of &quot;Interim President of the Senate&quot;, and, as their term is very short (one or two days) are not listed. The interim officeholders listed have hold the office in different circumstances and for a longer time (i.e. for more than one or two days).

<text>George Scala Chuter (born 9 July 1976) is an English rugby union ex player who played at Hooker for Leicester Tigers.

==Biography==
Chuter was born in Greenwich. He first started playing as a 12-year-old, when he went to Trinity School of John Whitgift in the London Borough of Croydon. He quickly established himself at hooker. He went on to play his club rugby for Old Mid-Whitgiftians and gained representative honours for the London Division U18 side.

==Club career==
Chuter was invited to trial for Saracens F.C. at the age of 19, where he played for five years.

Chuter took a year off and decided to travel in the U.S. and Australia; he was in Sydney for the 2000 Olympic Games. On returning he signed for Leicester Tigers in December 2000. After the departure of Richard Cockerill in the summer of 2002, he competed with Dorian West as first choice hooker.

In the 2006–07 season, Chuter played as Leicester won the final of the Guinness Premiership and Heineken Cup.

Chuter started in the final of the 2008–09 Guinness Premiership, which Leicester won, and 2008–09 Heineken Cup. Chuter started in the final of the 2009–10 Guinness Premiership, winning his third Premiership medal.

Chuter retired in 2014.

Chuter is currently Director of Rugby at Hinckley Rugby Club.

==International career==
In 1994–95 Chuter won his first cap for England Colts against Scotland and also went on that year&#x27;s summer tour to Canada. In 1998 he made a try-scoring debut for England A against France A at Tours, and in the same year went on the senior England &#x27;tour to hell&#x27; against , New Zealand and , featuring in the uncapped match at Invercargill against New Zealand Academy.

In 2003 Chuter was back in the England reckoning, and in 2004 was a member of the England A squad at the 2004 Churchill Cup in Canada. He was then selected for the Elite Player Squad but a second citing in October resulted in his missing the opportunity to take part in the November Tests. Chuter made his debut against Australia during England&#x27;s 2006 Tour of Australia. In the second test of the series and his second England appearance Chuter scored a try in a 43–18 defeat.

Sporting a full beard, he featured in the 2007 World Cup squad, battling with Mark Regan for the role of first-choice hooker. Chuter was a used replacement in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final.

<text>Sparrow Records is a Christian music record label and a division of Universal Music Group.

== History ==
Sparrow Records was founded in 1976 by Billy Ray Hearn, then artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) director at Myrrh Records. Barry McGuire was the first artist signed to the label, followed quickly by John Michael Talbot and his brother Terry, Janny Grein, and Annie Herring of 2nd Chapter of Acts; all of whom released albums with Sparrow in May of that year.

Purchased by Thorn EMI in 1992, Sparrow&#x27;s parent underwent a demerger four years later to become the EMI Group, and the label is now part of the Capitol Christian Music Group.

As of 2009, Sparrow&#x27;s artists include Britt Nicole, Chris Tomlin, Mandisa, Matt Redman, Matthew West, Steven Curtis Chapman and Switchfoot. Since 1996, a popular production of Sparrow Records has been the annual &quot;WOW Hits&quot; contemporary Christian music series. In 1998, the WOW franchise then added the annual &quot;WOW Gospel&quot; series of albums. The &quot;WOW Worship&quot; series was introduced in 1999.

<text>The 100 metres, or 100-meter dash, is a sprint race in track and field competitions. The shortest common outdoor running distance, the dash is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the sport of athletics. It has been contested at the Summer Olympics since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women. The inaugural World Championships were in 1983.

On an outdoor 400-metre running track, the 100 m is held on the home straight, with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race. There are three instructions given to the runners immediately before and at the beginning of the race: &quot;on your marks&quot;, &quot;set&quot;, and the firing of the starter&#x27;s pistol. The runners move to the starting blocks when they hear the &#x27;on your marks&#x27; instruction. The following instruction, to adopt the &#x27;set&#x27; position, allows them to adopt a more efficient starting posture and isometrically preload their muscles: this will help them to start faster. A race-official then fires the starter&#x27;s pistol to signal the race beginning and the sprinters stride forwards from the blocks. Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50 and 60 m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line.

The 10-second barrier has historically been a barometer of fast men&#x27;s performances, while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race. The men&#x27;s world record is 9.58 seconds, set by Jamaica&#x27;s Usain Bolt in 2009, while the women&#x27;s world record is 10.49 seconds, set by American Florence Griffith-Joyner in 1988.

The unofficial &quot;world&#x27;s fastest man or woman&quot; title typically goes to the Olympic or world 100 metres champion.
The 200 metre time almost always yields a &quot;faster&quot; average speed than a 100-metre race time, since the initial slow speed at the start is spread out over the longer distance. The current men&#x27;s Olympic and world champion is Noah Lyles, while the current women&#x27;s Olympic champion is Julien Alfred, and the world champion is Sha&#x27;Carri Richardson.

==Race dynamics==
===Start===
At the start, some athletes play psychological games such as trying to be last to the starting blocks.

At high level meets, the time between the gun and first kick against the starting block is measured electronically, via sensors built in the gun and the blocks. A reaction time less than 0.100 s is considered a false start. This time interval accounts for the sum of the time it takes for the sound of the starter&#x27;s pistol to reach the runners&#x27; ears, and the time they take to react to it.

For many years a sprinter was disqualified if responsible for two false starts individually. However, this rule allowed some major races to be restarted so many times that the sprinters started to lose focus. The next iteration of the rule, introduced in February 2003, meant that one false start was allowed among the field, but anyone responsible for a subsequent false start was disqualified.

This rule led to some sprinters deliberately false-starting to gain a psychological advantage: an individual with a slower reaction time might false-start, forcing the faster starters to wait and be sure of hearing the gun for the subsequent start, thereby losing some of their advantage. To avoid such abuse and to improve spectator enjoyment, the IAAF implemented a further change in the 2010 season – a false starting athlete now receives immediate disqualification. This proposal was met with objections when first raised in 2005, on the grounds that it would not leave any room for innocent mistakes. Justin Gatlin commented, &quot;Just a flinch or a leg cramp could cost you a year&#x27;s worth of work.&quot; The rule had a dramatic impact at the 2011 World Championships, when current world record holder Usain Bolt was disqualified.

===Mid-race===
Runners usually reach their top speed just past the halfway point of the race and progressively decelerate to the finish. Maintaining that top speed for as long as possible is a primary focus of training for the 100 m. Pacing and running tactics do not play a significant role in the 100 m, as success in the event depends more on pure athletic qualities and technique.

===Finish===
The winner, by IAAF Competition Rules, is determined by the first athlete with their torso (not including limbs, head, or neck) over the nearer edge of the finish line. There is therefore no requirement for the entire body to cross the finish line. When the placing of the athletes is not obvious, a photo finish is used to distinguish which runner was first to cross the line.

===Climatic conditions===
Climatic conditions, in particular air resistance, can affect performances in the 100 m. A strong head wind is very detrimental to performance, while a tail wind can improve performances significantly. For this reason, a maximum tail wind of is allowed for a 100 m performance to be considered eligible for records, or &quot;wind legal&quot;.

Furthermore, sprint athletes perform a better run at high altitudes because of the thinner air, which provides less air resistance. In theory, the thinner air would also make breathing slightly more difficult (due to the partial pressure of oxygen being lower), but this difference is negligible for sprint distances where all the oxygen needed for the short dash is already in the muscles and bloodstream when the race starts. While there are no limitations on altitude, performances made at altitudes greater than 1000 m above sea level are marked with an &quot;A&quot;.

==10-second and 11-second barriers==

The 10-second mark had been widely considered a barrier for the 100 metres in men&#x27;s sprinting. The first man to break the 10 second barrier with automatic timing was Jim Hines at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Since then, over 190 sprinters have run faster than 10 seconds. Similarly, 11 seconds is considered the standard for female athletes. The first woman to go under 11 seconds was Marlies Göhr in 1977.

==Record performances==

Major 100 m races, such as at the Olympic Games, attract much attention, particularly when the world record is thought to be within reach.

The men&#x27;s world record has been improved upon twelve times since electronic timing became mandatory in 1977. The current men&#x27;s world record of 9.58 s is held by Usain Bolt of Jamaica, set at the 2009 World Athletics Championships final in Berlin, Germany on 16 August 2009, breaking his own previous world record by 0.11 s. The current women&#x27;s world record of 10.49 s was set by Florence Griffith-Joyner of the US, at the 1988 United States Olympic Trials in Indianapolis, Indiana, on 16 July 1988 breaking Evelyn Ashford&#x27;s four-year-old world record by 0.27 seconds. The extraordinary nature of this result and those of several other sprinters in this race raised the possibility of a technical malfunction with the wind gauge which read at 0.0 m/s – a reading which was at complete odds to the windy conditions on the day with high wind speeds being recorded in all other sprints before and after this race as well as the parallel long jump runway at the time of the Griffith-Joyner performance. The next best wind legal performance is Elaine Thompson-Herah&#x27;s 10.54 second clocking in 2021 at the Prefontaine Classic. Griffith-Joyner&#x27;s next best legal performance of 10.61 from 1988, would have her third on the all-time list behind Thompson-Herah and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (10.60).

Some records have been marred by prohibited drug use – in particular, the scandal at the 1988 Summer Olympics when the winner, Canadian Ben Johnson was stripped of his medal and world record.

Jim Hines, Ronnie Ray Smith and Charles Greene were the first to break the 10-second barrier in the 100 m, all on 20 June 1968, the Night of Speed. Hines also recorded the first legal electronically timed sub-10 second 100 m in winning the 100 metres at the 1968 Olympics. Bob Hayes ran a wind-assisted 9.91 seconds at the 1964 Olympics.

<text>The K-9 (NATO reporting name AA-4 &#x27;Awl&#x27;) was a short-range air-to-air missile developed by the Soviet Union in the late 1950s. It was designed by MKB Raduga, a division of aircraft maker Mikoyan-Gurevich. The K-9 was also known as the K-155, and would apparently have had the service designation R-38. It was intended to arm the Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-152A (NATO reporting name &#x27;Flipper&#x27;), an experimental high speed twin-engine aircraft, predecessor to the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 &#x27;Foxbat&#x27;. When the Ye-152A was shown at Tushino in 1961, a prototype of the K-9 missile was displayed with it.

Neither the &#x27;Flipper&#x27; nor the &#x27;Awl&#x27; ever entered production.

<text>Henry Rangi Paul (born 10 February 1974) is a rugby union coach and former rugby league and rugby union player. A dual-code international, Paul won 24 caps for New Zealand in rugby league and 6 for England in rugby union, as well as rugby sevens. Paul played as a loose forward, stand-off, , and occasionally as a , and as a centre and fly-half in rugby union.

He holds the record for kicking the most goals in a Super League season, with 178 for Bradford in 2001, and the record for the most goals in a game, 14, for Bradford in 2000. He is the brother of former New Zealand rugby league international Robbie Hunter-Paul.

==Playing career==
Born in Tokoroa, New Zealand, Paul started playing rugby union at the age of three for Ponsonby Rugby Football Club and then rugby league for the Te Atatu Roosters. Later, during his time at Rutherford High School (1990), he led his team to break many Auckland club rugby league team and individual records. The following year, Paul moved to the Point Chevalier Pirates.

In the 1992 season he returned to Te Atatū, debuting in their senior premier team at 18 years of age, making the Auckland Rugby League Finals. That off season, Paul was selected as a utility player for the under-19 Auckland side, playing a major part in his team winning the national tournament. Following that success, Paul was selected as the Junior Kiwis captain to tour England that same off season.

Paul led by example when his team looked &quot;out of sorts&quot;, guiding them to memorable victories against their Great Britain counterparts. His form was so inspiring that he earned full New Zealand representative honours on the same tour, when the senior team the (New Zealand Kiwis) hit an injury crisis on a corresponding tour of Britain. Paul, at just 18 years of age, made his test début as a substitute against France.

===Wakefield Trinity===
Paul&#x27;s form on the Junior, and then subsequently New Zealand team tour, did not go unnoticed by scouts in England and in the off season of 1993/94 he joined Wakefield Trinity of the English Rugby Football League Championship.

===Return to New Zealand===
He returned to New Zealand for the 1994 season, playing five matches for the Waitakere City Raiders in the new Lion Red Cup. He originally signed for the new Auckland Warriors club who were to enter the Australian Rugby League in 1995 but they released him as part of a deal that allowed Andy Platt to join Auckland from Wigan.

===Wigan Warriors===

Paul joined Wigan Warriors for the 1994–95 season and quickly established himself in the squad. At the end of Super League&#x27;s first season, he was named at stand-off half in the 1996 Super League Dream Team. He played at stand-off half back for Wigan Warriors in their 1998 Super League Grand Final victory against Leeds Rhinos.

===Bradford Bulls===
In September 1998, at the end of his contract, he moved to the Bradford Bulls.

Paul played for Bradford Bulls at stand-off half back and scored his team&#x27;s sole try and goal in the 1999 Super League Grand Final which was lost to St. Helens. Paul scored one of the most famous tries in Super League, running from 60 metres, scoring the first try of the 1999 Super League Grand Final with one boot.

Paul was selected for the New Zealand team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Australia he partnered his brother Robbie in the halves, kicking six goals in the Kiwis&#x27; 22–20 loss. He helped beat his former club Wigan in the 2001 Super League Grand Final. When he was at Bradford he set a goalkicking record for consecutive goals (35), as well as for points in a season at the club.

===International rugby league===
In international rugby league he received 23 caps for New Zealand between 1995 and 2001, competing in the 1995 and 2000 Rugby League World Cups. Upon his return from rugby union in 2006 he qualified for both New Zealand and Great Britain.

===Gloucester (rugby union)===
Paul spoke to National Rugby League club the Canterbury Bulldogs and Super 12 clubs the Auckland Blues and the Waikato Chiefs. He was eventually tempted away from the Bradford Bulls to play rugby union for Gloucester, by Philippe Saint-André and Tom Walkinshaw.

He had a dream début for Gloucester, scoring 28 points against Caerphilly. Paul began a four-year contract at Kingsholm in 2001 and won an England A national squad selection after just one game for the Cherry and Whites.

He was linked with a return his former club the Bradford Bulls, the Widnes Vikings and a move to NRL club the Canberra Raiders and a reunion with former coach at Bradford Matthew Elliott.

Having experimented with being a fullback and fly-half he settled into the inside centre position and his long passing stood well with Gloucester&#x27;s style of play. He had his best year with Gloucester Rugby in 2004 when he won the club&#x27;s season ticket holders&#x27; Player of the Year award and was also nominated for the Zurich Premiership Player of the Year award alongside Bruce Reihana, Mark Robinson, Simon Shaw and Mark van Gisbergen. Whilst at Gloucester he started in the 2002 Zurich Championship Final (the year before winning the play-offs constituted winning the English title) in which Gloucester defeated Bristol Rugby, and the 2003 Powergen Cup Final in which Gloucester defeated Northampton Saints.

===England national team and sevens===
With his switch to rugby union, he decided to play for England rather than New Zealand. Although he was born in New Zealand, he qualified for England through his Liverpudlian grandfather.

He won his first England cap as a replacement against France in the 2002 Six Nations Championship, but only managed to win a handful of caps thereafter, mostly during the 2004 Six Nations Championship, coming off the bench in Rome and at Murrayfield. He was also considered Man of the Match for England A against France A in March 2004 – with five penalties and a conversion.

He excelled for the England Sevens side and was a member of the 2002 Commonwealth Games and 2006 Commonwealth Games squads, winning a silver medal in 2006. Paul also was the acting captain of England Sevens when it won the USA Sevens tournament in 2006 and was part of the only Rugby 7s squad to win the Hong Kong 7s with him being awarded player of the tournament. England 7s have failed to win in Hong Kong since their 2002 victory.

He was also a member of the England A team that won the 2003 Churchill Cup in Canada and returned there again on the 2004 Churchill Cup tour.

===Harlequins RL===

On 27 April 2006, Paul agreed a move back to rugby league joining Harlequins RL. The London side beat off competition from the Penrith Panthers to secure his signature.

His brother Robbie Paul played rugby league for Salford City Reds, having played with Paul at Bradford Bulls before a spell at Huddersfield Giants. Paul faced Robbie in his first game back in 2006&#x27;s Super League XI on 29 April 2006.

====Man of Steel Awards controversy====
In 2007 Paul appeared drunk at the European Super League&#x27;s Man of Steel Award&#x27;s dinner. Paul slurred his acceptance speech when he received the Frontline Fairplay Index Award, awarded for good behaviour on the field, on behalf of the club. and subsequently apologised for his actions.

===Leeds Carnegie===

In 2008, Paul was linked with a return to rugby union with Leeds Carnegie. But the move was initially seen as unlikely due to the team being relegated from the 2007–08 English Premiership.

The 34-year-old switched codes and joined Leeds Carnegie&#x27;s National League 1 campaign at the end of 2008&#x27;s Super League XIII.
Henry played at centre and fly-half for the two years at Carnegie. While in the RFU Championship he captained the side to their biggest victory in Carnegie history against Manchester and captained the side a numerous times, getting Man of the Match on several occasions. He helped Carnegie get promoted to the Premiership. Paul stayed with the side for one more year in the premiership before leaving the team to take up a coaching role as assistant coach for Russia&#x27;s national 15&#x27;s team.

===Rotherham Titans===

In 2010, Paul signed for RFU Championship side the Rotherham Titans. on a part-time basis.

Paul did not stay long at the club due to work commitments with Russia putting him out of the country for most of the year.

==Coaching career==

Paul was released from Leeds in 2010 to embark on his coaching career as he signed up as the assistant coach of Russia.

Paul started his role coaching Russia at the 2010 Churchill Cup in the United States. He then coached them during the 2010–12 European Nations Cup First Division and at the 2011 Churchill Cup held in England, coming close against Italy A and the United States.

Paul took the side to the 2011 Rugby World Cup with Kingsley Jones as head coach. After two years with the Russian 15s team, Paul was appointed rugby 7s coach. After almost 4 years with Russia, Paul left to undertake a teaching role.

Paul then took a role as Rugby Programmes Manager for Queen Ethelburga&#x27;s School in York for two years. Queen Ethelburga&#x27;s achieved their greatest rugby success in these two years winning the British Colleges National Cup and making it to the Semi-Finals of the Rosslyn Park 7s in 2015. Paul continued his national coaching experience during this time however, coaching India&#x27;s Men and Women&#x27;s 15s and 7s teams for various tournaments during this time.

Paul left Queen Ethelburga&#x27;s to move to be with his now wife in Dubai, United Arab Emirates taking up the role of Head Coach of the Jebel Ali Dragons in July 2016 and also being appointed Director of Rugby of the club in 2017. The club obtained their greatest success in years in the first year of Paul&#x27;s coaching, with them making both the West Asia Premiership final and the UAE Premiership Final. Despite not winning either of the finals the club was crowned West Asia Premiership winners in March 2018 with Paul also being awarded coach of the season.

===Canada===
Paul was asked to assist the Canadian rugby team in February 2018 during the America&#x27;s Rugby Championship and his performance secured him a permanent role as assistant coach of Canada Rugby alongside head coach Kingsley Jones in May 2018. The Jebel Ali Dragons Chairman Stuart Quinn said he was thrilled for Paul, despite the fact that they meant they were losing &quot;the best coach in the region&quot;.

Paul was the 15s assistant coach for over a year helping Canada qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan. Paul was then asked to act as interim Canada Rugby Sevens coach following the departure of coach Damian McGrath in May 2019, coaching the team for a month before taking them to the London and Paris Sevens. Despite Paul confirming the goal was to test players for the up-and-coming qualifiers for the Olympics in the Cayman Islands, Paul&#x27;s team succeeded in getting to the cup quarter finals in London and winning the Challenge Cup in Paris, achieving the team&#x27;s biggest success in the 2018/19 series. Paul then took the team to the Cayman Islands where they qualified for the 2020 Olympic Games in Japan in an undefeated tournament.

Paul&#x27;s &quot;interim&quot; status was removed and he was appointed head coach at the start of the 2019 7&#x27;s series and successfully coached the team for the 2019/2020 season. Canada achieve a bronze medal in the Vancouver 7&#x27;s after narrowly missing out on the final due to a last second try from Australia.

<text>Turn-On is an American surreal sketch comedy series created by Digby Wolfe and George Schlatter that aired once on ABC on Wednesday, February 5, 1969. Only one episode was shown partially before being pulled from ABC&#x27;s airing schedule, leaving another episode unaired. The show has since been considered one of the most infamous flops in TV history, with significantly low initial ratings and negative critical reception.

&quot;Turn-On&quot;&#x27;s sole broadcast episode replaced the Wednesday episode of &quot;Peyton Place&quot; - in fact, it was even referenced on the show itself, where, in the opening, Tim Conway refers to the show as &quot;Peyton Re-Place&quot;. Among the cast were Teresa Graves (who would join the &quot;Laugh-In&quot; cast that fall), Hamilton Camp, and Chuck McCann. The writing staff included Albert Brooks. The guest host for the first episode was Tim Conway, who also participated in certain sketches. Schlatter and Ed Friendly, who had previously been the producers of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, were contracted by Bristol-Myers to develop the show, and provided it to ABC for a projected 13-week run after it was rejected by NBC and CBS.

==Premise==

&quot;Turn-On&quot;&#x27;s premise was that it was &quot;the first computerized TV show&quot;, according to its opening sequence; the show had no sets except for a clinical white backdrop, where sketches generated by an artificially intelligent computer would be acted out. Unlike the generally appealing humor of &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, &quot;Turn-On&quot; was oriented around off-color humor and &quot;focused almost exclusively on sex as a comedic subject&quot;, using various rapid-fire jokes and risqué skits. Co-creator and production executive Digby Wolfe described it as a &quot;visual, comedic, sensory assault involving animation, videotape, stop-action film, electronic distortion, computer graphics—even people.&quot; Sounds created with Moog synthesizers were used in lieu of a laugh track, representing the computer&#x27;s laughter. The program was also filmed instead of presented live or on videotape; in a style of presentation that was novel for the time, several sketches and jokes were presented with the screen divided into four squares resembling comic strip panels. The production credits of the episode were inserted at random intervals after the first commercial break, instead of conventionally at the beginning or end.

==Reaction==
When initially presented to CBS, a network official stated that &quot;Turn-On&quot; was &quot;so fast with the cuts and chops that some of our people actually got physically disturbed by it.&quot; Tim Conway has stated that &quot;Turn-On&quot; was canceled midway through its only episode, so that the party that the cast and crew held for its premiere as the show aired across the United States also marked its cancellation. A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Conway later claimed that the Cleveland ABC affiliate, WEWS-TV, replaced the show after the first commercial break and utilized an &quot;emergency protocol&quot; of a black screen with live organ music.

Ten minutes into &quot;Turn-On&quot;, WEWS general manager Donald Perris called ABC&#x27;s headquarters by telephone to notify that they would no longer air the show and sent to ABC president Elton Rule an angry telegram: &quot;If your naughty little boys have to write dirty words on the walls, please don&#x27;t use our walls. &quot;Turn-On&quot; is turned off, as far as WEWS is concerned.&quot; After the program aired, a WEWS spokesman claimed that the station&#x27;s switchboard was &quot;lit up&quot; with protest calls, and Perris derided &quot;Turn-On&quot; as being &quot;in excessive poor taste&quot;. George Schlatter would later accuse Perris of actively lobbying other affiliates &quot;prior&quot; to the broadcast to force a network cancellation after objecting to it replacing &quot;Peyton Place&quot; on the Wednesday night schedule. At the same time, WAKR-TV in Akron, Ohio—the Cleveland market&#x27;s other primary ABC affiliate—did not receive any negative phone calls but their general manager criticized the show&#x27;s &quot;questionable taste&quot;.

Several stations in the eastern time zones refused to air &quot;Turn-On&quot; before its premiere, including Memphis, Tennessee&#x27;s WHBQ-TV who refused to air due to the management calling the show &quot;too sexy and was not up to our broadcast standards for that time of evening&quot;. The station quickly replaced it with an episode of &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;. After seeing the episode, several stations in the later western time zones decided not to broadcast the show at all, including Portland, Oregon&#x27;s KATU, Seattle, Washington&#x27;s KOMO-TV, and Denver, Colorado&#x27;s KBTV, which stated: &quot;We have decided, without hesitation, that it would be offensive to a major segment of the audience.&quot; Viewers of Little Rock, Arkansas&#x27;s KATV, which disliked the show but decided to air it, &quot;jam[med] the station&#x27;s switchboard&quot; with complaints. Dallas, Texas ABC affiliate WFAA elected to air the show on the following Sunday night at 10:30 local time, to an overwhelmingly negative response.

Both &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the Associated Press gave the show poor reviews. An ABC executive stated that &quot;creatively, &quot;Turn-On&quot; didn&#x27;t work&quot;. He compared the show negatively to the comedy of Dean Martin, &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, and the Smothers Brothers, which the executive described as &quot;absolutely beyond belief ... awfully blue&quot;, but were popular and less controversial because unlike &quot;Turn-On&quot;, &quot;they&#x27;re funny&quot;. After &quot;Turn-On&quot;″s cancellation &quot;TV Guide&quot; called the show &quot;The biggest bomb of the season&quot;. It stated that both CBS and NBC had rejected the show due to its perceived lack of quality, and that its sexual content was an important reason why viewers rejected the show. The magazine quoted a source who lamented &quot;Turn-On&quot;&#x27;s lack of a regular host or interlocutor: &quot;(T)here wasn&#x27;t any sort of identification with the audience -- just a bunch of strangers up there insulting everything you believe in.&quot;

Conway said in 2008 that &quot;Turn-On&quot; was &quot;way ahead of its time. I&#x27;m not sure even if you saw it today that maybe that time has also passed.&quot; Bart Andrews, in his 1980 book &quot;The Worst TV Shows Ever&quot;, stated that &quot;Turn-On&quot; was actually quite close to the original concept for &quot;Laugh-In&quot;. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that it was a bad show, it was that it was an awkward show,&quot; concluded author Harlan Ellison, a fan of counter-cultural comedy and a TV critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; in 1969.

On February 7, ABC announced that &quot;Turn-On&quot; would go on hiatus. Instead of the scheduled February 12 episode, the &quot;ABC Wednesday Night Movie&quot; (&quot;The Oscar&quot;, itself an infamous flop) would start 30 minutes early. This announcement came after the following week&#x27;s &quot;TV Guide&quot; went to press; it published a listing for the scheduled February 12 episode, which would have starred Robert Culp and then-wife France Nuyen as hosts. Finally, on February 10, the show was formally canceled. By this time, WEWS, KBTV, and KATV all told ABC that they would not air the show again; with several other affiliates having already turned it down, it no longer made financial sense to air it. ABC received 369 calls of complaint during the show and 20 calls that supported it; by comparison, the network received 1,800 protest calls several weeks earlier after preempting the &quot;Wednesday Night Movie&quot; for an address by President Richard Nixon introducing his cabinet appointees. Network officials told sponsor Bristol-Myers that the show was unacceptable and Bristol-Myers ordered Schlatter and Friendly to end production. Many assumed the show&#x27;s title was itself an implicit reference to Timothy Leary&#x27;s pro-drug maxim, &quot;Turn on, tune in, drop out&quot;.

The network eventually replaced &quot;Turn On&quot; with a revival of &quot;The King Family Show&quot; focusing on the Four King Cousins. The controversy led ABC to reject a pilot written by Norman Lear, stating that the lead character was &quot;foul-mouthed, and bigoted&quot;, out of fear that it might anger its affiliates again. CBS liked the pilot, picked it up as &quot;All in the Family&quot;, and began airing it during the 1970-71 midseason.

In 2002, &quot;Turn-On&quot; was ranked number 27 on &quot;TV Guide&#x27;s&quot; 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time. &quot;What Were They Thinking?: The 100 Dumbest Events in Television History&quot; ranked it at number 25.

Both completed episodes are available for public viewing at the Paley Center for Media. They were also made available for viewing on YouTube on October 9, 2023. On February 4, 2024, a third episode was released on YouTube, composed of unused footage from Conway&#x27;s episode as well as footage from an episode guest-starring Sebastian Cabot of &quot;Family Affair&quot;.

<text>Radu Vasile (; 10 October 1942 – 3 July 2013) was a Romanian politician, historian, academic/professor, and poet.

Originally a member of the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ-CD), Vasile served as the Prime Minister of Romania between 17 April 1998 and 13 December 1999, and was notably confronted with the last Mineriad (more specifically the February 1999 Mineriad). Subsequently, between 2000 and 2004, he was elected as a Senator on behalf the Democratic Party (PD). In addition to his political career, Vasile published poetry under the pen name &quot;Radu Mischiu&quot;.

== Biography ==

Vasile was born in Sibiu in 1942, and was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. In 1967, he graduated from the Faculty of History at the University of Bucharest. For political reasons (his father having been a political prisoner, a lawyer, deceased in 1986), he was barred access to higher education immediately after graduating school. In 1971, he became a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Economic History at the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies (ASE). In 1977, he obtained a Ph.D. in Economics from the same institution of higher education and in 1978 he became a lecturer at this institution.

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Vasile was elected (with student support) Vice Dean of the Faculty of Commerce at ASE, a position he held until 1992. After 1990, he took refresher studies in European Integration at Thessaloniki, Greece and Munich, Germany. In 1994, he became a professor at the Bucharest Academy of Economic Sciences (ASE).

He died of colon cancer in Bucharest in 2013, and was buried at the city&#x27;s Bellu Cemetery.

== Political activity ==

He became a member of the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ-CD) in January 1990. On the party line, Radu Vasile gradually advanced as follows: head of department (Studies Department), alternate member of BCCC after the Christian Democratic National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ-CD) congress in September 1991, spokesman since 1991, senator from Bacău since 1992, Secretary General after the Congress from 1996. Between 1993 and 1994, he was the director of the newspaper &quot;Dreptatea&quot;.

Since 1993, he has been vice-president of the Senate of Romania and vice-president of the Senatorial Budget-Finance Commission (commission for budget, finance, banking and capital market). In the 1996–2000 legislature, Radu Vasile was a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with the Russian Federation and the State of Israel. In the 2000–2004 legislature, Radu Vasile was a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with UNESCO and the Lebanese Republic. Radu Vasile initiated 2 legislative proposals, of which 1 was enacted law.

In terms of foreign policy, Radu Vasile also had an important activity, being a founding member of the Central European Forum, along with Raymond Barre (former Prime Minister of France), Helmut Schmidt (former Chancellor of Germany), and others.

He lectured on Romanian history at the &quot;Doctoral Schools&quot; at the Sorbonne and gave over 50 scientific papers at academic sessions in the country and abroad.

Radu Vasile was a senator in the 1992–1996, 1996–2000, and 2000–2004 legislatures, last time elected on the lists of the Democratic Party (PD); he was a member of the parliamentary friendship groups with Lebanon and UNESCO. As Prime Minister, he was confronted with the Mineriad of February 1999 which his government solved (along with former President Emil Constantinescu) by the so-called &quot;Peace of Cozia&quot;.

<text>One Little Independent Records (formerly One Little Indian Records) is an English independent record label. It was set up in 1985 by members of various anarcho-punk bands, and managed by former Flux of Pink Indians bassist Derek Birkett. In the 1990s it set up a number of subsidiary labels.

== History ==
One Little Indian Records was founded in 1985 by members of various anarcho-punk bands, and managed by former Flux of Pink Indians bassist Derek Birkett, with the name inspired by the &quot;philosophies of the Indigenous People of the Americas&quot;.

The label&#x27;s first success came with A.R. Kane and Flux of Pink Indians in 1986. Success continued with Alabama 3, Björk, Chumbawamba, Kitchens of Distinction, The Shamen, Skunk Anansie, Sneaker Pimps, and the Sugarcubes.

Beginning in 1990, the label created several autonomous satellite imprints including Clean-up Records, Partisan Records and Fat Cat Records, all of which had success. Artists on the labels included Alabama 3 (A3), Sigur Rós, and Sneaker Pimps. Elemental Records was added to the roster in 1995.

The song titles of The Shamen&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Hempton Manor&quot; form an acrostic, spelling out &quot;Fuck Birket&quot; in an acrimonious reference to founder Birkett, who wanted the group to move back into more commercial territory.

In 1997 and 2001, the company also acquired some of the old Rough Trade Records and Nude Records labels, and the rights to several albums previously released by spinART Records.

In 2009, Paul McCartney, along with Youth, released an album called &quot;Electric Arguments&quot; under the name of The Fireman through One Little Indian.

In June 2020, in response to worldwide protests following the murder of George Floyd, it was announced that the company&#x27;s name would be changed from One Little Indian Records to One Little Independent Records with immediate effect, and that the company would donate money towards organisations which promote and assist Native American communities in North America. In a written statement, Birkett said:The last few weeks have been a monumental learning curve ... Following the receipt of an eye-opening letter from a Crass fan that detailed precisely why the logo and label name are offensive, as well as the violent history of the terminology, I felt equally appalled and grateful to them for making me understand what must be changed.

<doc id="1231332" wikidata="Q1310699" url="?curid=1231332" title="Thomas DeSimone">
<text>Thomas DeSimone (June 6, 1946 – disappeared January 14, 1979) was an American criminal associated with New York City&#x27;s Lucchese crime family who is alleged to have participated in both the Air France robbery and the Lufthansa heist. He also committed numerous murders, including killing William &quot;Billy Batts&quot; Bentvena in 1970. DeSimone went missing in 1979 and is believed to have been murdered.

DeSimone&#x27;s career in the Lucchese family is explored in the book &quot;Wiseguy&quot; by Nicholas Pileggi, and inspired the character of Tommy DeVito, portrayed by Joe Pesci, one of the main characters of the 1990 film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.

== Early life ==
Thomas DeSimone was born in New York City, New York, on June 6, 1946. He had two sisters, Dolores and Phyllis, and two brothers, Robert and Anthony. Both of his brothers were associates of the Gambino crime family; Anthony was murdered by mobster Thomas Agro in 1979. Phyllis was a mistress of James Burke from the time she was aged 16. DeSimone was also the brother-in-law of mobster Joseph &quot;The Barber&quot; Spione, who was slain for refusing to help kill DeSimone in the late 1970s.

In 1965, when he was aged 19, DeSimone was introduced to Paul Vario, a &quot;caporegime&quot; in the Lucchese crime family. Henry Hill, a Vario associate who was in his early 20s at the time, later recounted his first meeting with DeSimone, describing him as &quot;a skinny kid who was wearing a wiseguy suit and a pencil mustache.&quot; DeSimone worked under Vario, Burke and Hill, among others, becoming involved in truck hijackings, fencing stolen property, extortion, fraud and murder. While hijacking, DeSimone would always carry his gun in a brown paper bag. &quot;Walking down the street, he looked like he was bringing you a sandwich instead of a .38&quot;, Hill said.

== Air France robbery ==

During the 1960s, Air France was the carrier of American currency that had been exchanged in Southeast Asia. The airline had contracted to return the money to the U.S. for depositing with American banks. The money was usually carried in linen bags, each containing $60,000, and the airline shipped up to $1 million a week in this manner. The money was stored in a cement-block strong room at Air France&#x27;s cargo terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport, with a round-the-clock private security guard. In 1967, Robert McMahon, an Air France employee, tipped off Burke, Hill, and DeSimone to an incoming delivery of between $400,000 and $700,000 in cash on Friday, April 7. McMahon said the best time for the actual robbery would be just before midnight when the security guard would be on his meal break.

On the day of the robbery, Hill and DeSimone drove to Kennedy airport with an empty suitcase, the largest Hill could find. At 11:40 pm, they entered the Air France cargo terminal. McMahon suggested that they should just walk in, as people often came to the terminal to pick up lost baggage. DeSimone and Hill entered the unsecured area unchallenged and unlocked the door with a duplicate key. Using a small flashlight, they found seven of the bags, which they loaded into the suitcase and left; $420,000 was taken. No alarm was raised, no shots fired, and no one was injured. The theft was not discovered until the following Monday, when a Wells Fargo truck arrived to pick up the cash to be delivered to the CNEP subsidiary French American Banking Corporation.

== Murder of William Bentvena ==

After his release from prison in 1970, according to the mafia memoir &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, Henry Hill describes the &quot;welcome home&quot; party for William Bentvena at Robert&#x27;s Lounge, a nightclub owned by Jimmy Burke: Bentvena jokingly asked DeSimone &quot;if he still shined shoes&quot;, which DeSimone perceived as an insult, and leaning over to Hill and Burke intoned, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna kill that fuck.&quot; Two weeks later, on June 11, 1970, Bentvena was at &quot;The Suite&quot;, Hill&#x27;s nightclub in Queens. With the club nearly empty, DeSimone pistol-whipped Bentvena, yelling &quot;Shine these fucking shoes!&quot; before beating him bloody. After Bentvena was severely beaten and presumed dead, DeSimone, Burke, and Hill placed his body in the trunk of Hill&#x27;s car, stopping at DeSimone&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house for a knife, lime, and a shovel. Hearing sounds from the trunk, they realized that Bentvena was still alive, so DeSimone and Burke beat him to death with the shovel and a tire iron. Burke had a friend who owned a dog kennel in Upstate New York, and Bentvena was buried there.

About three months after Bentvena&#x27;s murder, Burke&#x27;s friend sold the dog kennel to housing developers, and Burke ordered Hill and DeSimone to exhume Bentvena&#x27;s corpse and dispose of it elsewhere. In &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, Hill said the body was eventually crushed in a compactor at a New Jersey junkyard, which was owned by Clyde Brooks. However, on the commentary for the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, he states that Bentvena&#x27;s body was buried in the basement of Robert&#x27;s Lounge, and that it was only later put in the compactor.

== Murders of Gianco, Cersani, and Jerothe ==

DeSimone&#x27;s , described by Hill, was of a young man named Michael &quot;Spider&quot; Gianco, who was serving as a bartender at a card game. Gianco and DeSimone had an argument, after Gianco forgot DeSimone&#x27;s drink, that resulted in DeSimone pulling out a handgun and shooting him in the thigh. A week later, when Gianco was again serving drinks and sporting a full leg cast, DeSimone started to goad him about his wounded leg, spurring Gianco to tell DeSimone to &quot;go fuck [himself]&quot;. After a stunned silence, an impressed Burke, having now developed a respect for Gianco for sticking up for himself, gave him some money before jokingly teasing DeSimone, who hadn&#x27;t said or done anything in retaliation, about &quot;going soft&quot;. DeSimone lost his temper and fatally shot Gianco three times in the chest, angrily demanding of Burke if that was &quot;good enough for [him]&quot;. Burke, furious with DeSimone, made him bury Gianco&#x27;s body in the cellar by himself.

Hill stated after he witnessed this incident that he was convinced that DeSimone was a psychopath. It is believed that Gianco&#x27;s body was subsequently moved because it was not found in that location. On &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Hill said that Gianco was buried next to Robert&#x27;s Lounge along with other bodies.

DeSimone&#x27;s fourth murder, according to Hill, occurred when he and another associate named Stanley Diamond got carried away after being asked to &quot;rough up&quot; a witness to a robbery. After a truck heist, a foreman had refused to allow Burke to unload the stolen cargo in his warehouse and vehemently protested because they had no union cards. Burke attempted to reason with the foreman, who stood his ground and refused to be intimidated. Burke later sent DeSimone and Diamond to the foreman&#x27;s house in rural New Jersey, with instructions to &quot;rough up&quot; the man to ensure he would cooperate with Burke in the future. DeSimone and Diamond, angry and worked up about having to drive all the way to New Jersey, ended up beating the man to death.

DeSimone&#x27;s fifth murder occurred when Burke ordered the murder of his best friend, Dominick &quot;Remo&quot; Cersani. Burke got suspicious about Cersani and later found out from contacts in a Queens DA&#x27;s office that he was talking to the New York City Police Department (NYPD), and that they were going to arrest Burke on a truck hijacking charge. DeSimone and Burke met Cersani at Robert&#x27;s Lounge and said to him, &quot;Let&#x27;s take a ride&quot;. DeSimone strangled Cersani with piano wire. Hill said in &quot;Wiseguy&quot;: &quot;Remo put up some fight. He kicked and swung and shit all over himself before he died.&quot; Burke had Cersani&#x27;s body buried next to the bocce court behind Robert&#x27;s Lounge.

On December 18, 1974, DeSimone killed Ronald Jerothe, a protégé of then-Gambino associate John Gotti. DeSimone had dated Jerothe&#x27;s sister and had beaten her up, prompting Jerothe to threaten to kill him. When DeSimone heard about the threat, he went to Jerothe&#x27;s apartment and killed him.

== Lufthansa heist and Edwards murder ==

On December 11, 1978, an estimated $5.875 million (equivalent to $ million in ) was stolen from the Lufthansa cargo terminal at Kennedy airport, with $5 million in cash and $875,000 in jewelry, making it the largest cash robbery committed on U.S. soil at the time. Burke decided on DeSimone, McMahon, Angelo Sepe, Louis Cafora, Joe Manri, and Paolo LiCastri as the robbers. Burke&#x27;s son Frank would drive one of the back-up vehicles while Parnell &quot;Stacks&quot; Edwards, a musician and career criminal, was given the task of disposing of the getaway van afterwards.

After the heist, Edwards was instructed to drive the vehicle to New Jersey, where it (along with any potential evidence inside) was to be destroyed in a junkyard belonging to Gotti. Instead, Edwards parked the van in front of a fire hydrant at his girlfriend&#x27;s apartment, where police discovered it two days after the heist. The plates were stolen and the police impounded the van. They soon found Stacks’ fingerprints and connected it to the robbery. Vario subsequently ordered DeSimone to kill Edwards. Once he found out where Edwards was hiding, DeSimone and Sepe visited Edwards and shot him five times in the head.

== Disappearance ==
On January 14, 1979, DeSimone&#x27;s wife, Angela, reported him missing. She said she had last seen DeSimone a few weeks earlier when he borrowed $60 from her. It is believed that DeSimone was murdered as revenge for the two unsanctioned murders of John Gotti&#x27;s men, Bentvena and Jerothe. Another theory is that DeSimone eventually became suspected of being a police informant and was killed by Jimmy Burke. 

When Hill became an FBI informant in 1980, he told authorities that DeSimone had been murdered by the Gambino family. Despite the oft-given date of death of January 14, 1979, the exact date of DeSimone&#x27;s murder is uncertain. Hill claimed that in &quot;the week after Christmas&quot;, he and Burke had gone to Florida to straighten out a drug deal gone bad. DeSimone had remained behind in New York, having been told in late December 1978 or early January 1979 that he was going to be made. Peter Vario (Paul Vario&#x27;s son) and Bruno Facciolo took him to an unknown location, where he was murdered. Hill also indicated in both the book &quot;Wiseguy&quot; and the DVD commentary to &quot;Goodfellas&quot; that DeSimone had already been killed when Martin Krugman disappeared on January 6, 1979. In 1994, Hill, in his book &quot;Gangsters and Goodfellas&quot;, gave an expanded story of the events leading up to DeSimone&#x27;s death, which was in part due to DeSimone&#x27;s attempted rape of Hill&#x27;s wife, Karen.

Two theories about DeSimone&#x27;s alleged murder and murderer(s) exist from mob &quot;insiders&quot;. According to mob informant Joseph &quot;Joe Dogs&quot; Iannuzzi, Thomas Agro claimed in 1985 that he had murdered DeSimone, as well as his brother Anthony after he turned informant. Agro also suggested murdering the eldest and last remaining brother, Robert. According to Ianuzzi, Agro would often laughingly refer to killing the third DeSimone brother, stating: &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s time to go for the DeSimone trifecta!&quot; Another account, told by Hill in &quot;Gangsters and Goodfellas&quot;, states that Gotti himself was the assassin, although in the presence of Agro. On May 17, 2007, episode of &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Hill reaffirmed that Gotti had killed DeSimone. He also added that the death &quot;took a long time&quot;, as Bentvena had been a personal friend of Gotti&#x27;s, and he wanted DeSimone to suffer before he died. Gotti&#x27;s role as the assassin was repeated in the 2015 book &quot;The Lufthansa Heist&quot;, co-written by Hill and journalist Daniel Simone, although this account claims that DeSimone&#x27;s death was instantaneous from three gunshots to the head. According to Sal Polisi, DeSimone was killed by Agro (in the presence of Gotti), and that Agro slowly tortured him to death.

It has been theorized DeSimone is buried in The Hole, a suspected &quot;Mafia graveyard&quot; on the Brooklyn-Queens border near Kennedy airport, where the body of Al Indelicato was found in 1981 and where the bodies of Philip Giaccone and Dominick Trinchera were recovered by police in 2004.

==Portrayal in film==

DeSimone was portrayed by Joe Pesci in the 1990 movie &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, renamed Tommy DeVito. Pesci won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his depiction.

<text>Mark John Cueto (born 26 December 1979 in Workington, Cumbria) is a former English international rugby union player. He played on the wing for Sale Sharks and England. He is currently the third leading try scorer in the Aviva Premiership.

On 28 January 2015, it was announced Cueto was to retire at the end of the 2014-15 season

==Biography==
Mark Cueto was born to Frank and Anne Cueto. He has a sister called Rachel. He owes his surname to his Spanish great-grandfather, Antonio, who sailed from Santander in the 1900s and settled in Maryport, Cumbria, where he set up a fish-and-chip shop. His Cumbrian home town of Workington is in an area more associated with rugby league than union. Although he played his first rugby game as an eight-year-old in Workington, and played after he moved with his parents to Wolverhampton, he did not grow up playing the game. When he was 10 years old, his parents moved again to Crewe, where he took up football instead of rugby, becoming a keen Manchester United fan. He did not play rugby again until he was 17. His early clubs were Crewe &amp; Nantwich RUFC, Sandbach RUFC and Altrincham Kersal, with the latter he won the Cheshire RFU Plate in 1998.

Then, when he was 17 and in his final A-level year at Alsager Comprehensive, there was the annual rugby match against Holmes Chapel. It was an occasion of no great importance. Holmes Chapel had a reasonable team, but rugby players were thin on the ground at Alsager and there was not much debate about the likely result. To make up a team, Alsager teacher Lindsay Purcell recruited a number of footballers. Cueto was one of those press-ganged into service, though when it came to sport he was easily persuaded. Football was number one but he had also done athletics, basketball, volleyball and cricket.

Cueto is married to Suzie (née Richards), originally from Corby in Northamptonshire, who works in the Manchester United FC hospitality department. She gave birth to a baby boy called Max, their first child, on 6 August 2010. The couple have two more sons called Louis (b. 2013) and Joshua (b. 2018). They live together in Altrincham. He is a graduate of Manchester Metropolitan University.

In 2009, Cueto was featured in a campaign of male underwear for Jockey International. He also appeared as a guest in two episodes of the quiz show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; in 2005.

==Career==
===Sale Sharks===
Cueto made his début for Sale Sharks against Bristol Shoguns in 2001 and made the England tour to Argentina in 2002, playing against Argentina A.

Cueto saw success at club level in his first five years at the club, winning the European Challenge Cup twice, first in 2002 when Sale beat Pontypridd 25–22 at the Kassam Stadium on 26 May 2002. He was also part of the Sale team that beat Pau, the champions in 2000, by 27 points to 3, also at the Kassam Stadium on 21 May 2005. Cueto scored a try in the victory. He had his best individual season in 2004–05, scoring 11 tries in just 18 games played. Cueto helped Sale Sharks to top the league in the 2005–06 season and carry that form through to win the season ending play-offs, scoring a try as they beat Leicester Tigers in the final, to become Premiership champions for the first time.

In May 2010, Cueto was voted into Sale Shark&#x27;s Hall of Fame. He played his 150th match for Sale in their 54–21 defeat to Leicester in late December 2010. A few days later, Cueto was appointed club captain by the new coach Pete Anglesea; Anglesea replaced Mike Brewer as Sale had won just three out of nine matches in the 2010–11 season by mid-December. Cueto was Sale&#x27;s sixth captain of the season. In April, Cueto was banned by the Rugby Football Union for nine weeks after pleading guilty to &quot;making contact with the eye or eye area&quot;. The incident involved Christian Day and occurred in a match against Northampton on 2 April. At the start of the 2011–12 season, in August, Cueto was replaced as Sale captain, with Sam Tuitupou taking over role.

On 8 February 2013 Cueto broke the Premiership try scoring record of 75 by Steve Hanley, touching down for his 76th try in a 21-16 comeback win over Exeter. He eventually retired in 2015 after having scored a then record 90 tries. His record was broken on 10 February 2017 by Bristol&#x27;s wing Tom Varndell.

Cueto was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to rugby union.

===International===
Cueto represented England in the 2000–01 World Sevens Series. Cueto appears alongside All Blacks captain Richie McCaw on the cover of the United Kingdom version of the EA Sports game &quot;Rugby 08&quot;.

He was not selected for the full England squad during Clive Woodward&#x27;s time as head coach, having to wait until November 2004 for his début against Canada at Twickenham, when he scored two tries. He would play for England up until 2011, scoring 20 tries, at the time the 7th most try scored for his Country.

In 2005, he was called up to the British &amp; Irish Lions for their New Zealand tour after original selection Iain Balshaw was ruled out due to injury. He featured in the third Test at Eden Park, Auckland. The same year he was the top try scorer in the 2005 Six Nations with 4.

Cueto was a prominent member of England&#x27;s 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. He started the first match of England&#x27;s defence of the title at Full-back against the USA. He also played in England&#x27;s embarrassing 36–0 defeat to South Africa. Having been dropped for the next match against Samoa, he was installed to the English defence for the encounter with Tonga, which ensured England&#x27;s progression through to the quarter-final stage. He was left out of the surprise quarter-final victory against Australia and the even more surprising semi-final victory over France due to a niggling injury. During the semi-final, England wing Josh Lewsey suffered a pulled hamstring and was forced to miss the final.

Cueto was selected to take his place for the 2007 final against previous pool opponents, South Africa. His participation in the match became memorable when he was denied a try in the second half of the match by Australian television match official Stuart Dickinson. After a great deal of deliberation over real-time footage (and facing a language barrier with a French television producer who did not provide the stills he wanted) Dickinson disallowed the try on the basis of Cueto&#x27;s left foot entering touch (touching the side-line) before the ball was grounded. This was not immediately obvious and Cueto&#x27;s left leg was subsequently raised within the boundary of play, travelling over it after the ball was on the ground; this led many to believe the judgement had been wrongly made on the basis of the latter movement. A division of opinion still exists, although most experts including BBC Radio 5 Live presenter Ian Robertson subsequently backed Dickinson&#x27;s decision.

He did not feature for England throughout 2008, but was recalled to the squad for the 2009 Six Nations, scoring a try in the opening game against Italy and in England&#x27;s 34–10 victory over France.

Cueto was a regular for England throughout 2010 and 2011, and contributed to England&#x27;s successful 2011 Six Nations campaign. Cueto won his 50th cap for England in the final match of the Six Nations against Ireland. Cueto missed the first 2 games of the 2011 Rugby World cup in New Zealand due to a back injury, but completed a hat-trick of tries when returning to the starting line up against Romania.

<doc id="1231340" wikidata="Q4947525" url="?curid=1231340" title="Boss Volenti">
<text>Boss Volenti are an Irish rock quartet from Dublin, formed in 2003. Rob Daly, Martin Murphy and Dan O&#x27;Connor first met while playing in bands around Dublin. Then followed Laura Mackey, who O&#x27;Connor met while both were studying guitar at college. Following Murphy&#x27;s departure, drummer Graham Hopkins met the band in 2005 when they were demoing recordings for their first album and asked if he could join. The band&#x27;s influences include Thin Lizzy, Al Green, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Hall &amp; Oates.

== Career ==
In February 2006, Boss Volenti independently released a single, &quot;Deeper Than Deep&quot;, and it went straight into the Top 40 Irish Singles Chart. They released a second single, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Use&quot;, in June to even greater success. It received heavy daytime airplay on Irish radio, was playlisted by 2FM, championed by Tony Fenton on Today FM and regularly played on BBC NI Radio. Boss Volenti released their first album, &quot;Boss Volenti&quot;, in Ireland and on iTunes on 8 September 2006.

They performed at Electric Picnic 2008 after which Graham Hopkins left the band.

<doc id="1231346" wikidata="Q5251547" url="?curid=1231346" title="Defibrator">
<text>The defibrator is a machine used as part of the manufacturing process for MDF man-made wooden board. It produces fine wooden fibres, finer than the cut chips used to make chipboard. Although small, these fibres retain good structural integrity.

The machine itself is a thermo mechanical pulping refiner in which the pulp material, such as wood chips, is ground in an environment of steam between a rotating grinding disc (rotor) and a stationary disc (stator) each with radial grooves that provides the grinding surface. Wood chips are fed into the centre and are broken down as the centrifugal force pushes them towards the circumference of the discs where the grooves are finer to produce wood fibre. The size of the refined fibres can to some extent be controlled by altering the distance between the discs where a closer distance produces finer fibres but also requires higher grinding force. The capacity per machine is largely determined by the size of the machine, as well as the motor speed, which can be 1,500 or 1,800rpm.

==History==
In 1931 the Swedish engineer Arne Asplund filed a patent on a method to defibrate wood chips. As opposed to the Masonite-method, the defibrator-method (also known as the Asplund-method) uses pressurised steam to soften the wood chips, then grinding discs to pull the wood fibres apart. This grinding unit is what Asplund called the defibrator. It became the key product of his company, AB Defibrator. The Defibrator trademark is now held by Valmet, the successor of AB Defibrator, for its line of refiners for the panelboard industry.

<doc id="1231350" wikidata="Q1950863" url="?curid=1231350" title="Chudov Monastery">
<text>The Chudov Monastery (; more formally known as Alexius’ Archangel Michael Monastery) was founded in the Moscow Kremlin in 1358 by Metropolitan Alexius of Moscow. The monastery was dedicated to the miracle (&quot;chudo&quot; in Russian) of the Archangel Michael at Chonae (feast day: ). The Monastery was closed in 1918 and dismantled in 1929 by the Soviet government.

==History==
The construction of the monastery together with its &quot;katholikon&quot; (cathedral) was finished in 1365. The katholikon was replaced with a new one in 1431 and then once again in 1501–1503. It was traditionally used for baptising the royal children, including future Tsars Feodor I, Aleksey I and Peter the Great. The monastery’s hegumen (abbot) was considered the first among the hegumens of all the Russian monasteries until 1561.

Alongside Simonov Monastery and Trinity–St. Sergius Lavra, the Chudov Monastery was the biggest center of the Muscovite book culture and learning. Prominent monks of the monastery, who dedicated their lives to translating and correcting ecclesiastic books, include Maximus the Greek, Yepifany Slavinetsky and Karion Istomin. Gennady, who as Archbishop of Novgorod, patronized the first complete codex of the Bible in Slavic in 1499, was hegumen of the monastery prior to his archiepiscopate.

Patriarch Hermogenes was starved to death by the Poles in the monastery vaults in 1612. The Time of Troubles over, they opened the Greek-Latin School with support from Patriarch Filaret. In 1744–1833, the cloister accommodated the Moscow Ecclesiastic . As time went by, new churches were added to the monastery complex. These included the Church of St Alexius the Metropolitan and the Church of the Annunciation (both built in 1680) and the Church of Saint Andrew (1887).

During the French invasion of Russia (1812), the French Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout commandeered the monastery for his own use. A painting by Vasily Vereshchagin shows Davout desecrating the cathedral, using the sanctuary itself as his office. Following the Bolshevik Revolution, the Chudov Monastery was closed down in 1918. All of its structures demolished in 1929, as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s ongoing policy of state atheism.

On the site of the destroyed Chudov Monastery and the nearby Ascension Convent the Soviet government built the Red Commanders School. All of the monastery’s manuscripts of the 11th-18th centuries were transferred to the State Historical Museum. The relics of Metropolitan Alexius were first moved from the Church of St. Alexius (which he had built) to the Cathedral of the Dormition and then to another church in Moscow. Of the hundred or so other interments in the monastery (including Archbishop Gennady), their remains were lost and their whereabouts are still unknown.

A scene in Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; is set at the monastery.

In 2007 Orthodox public figure Vitaly Vladimirovich Averyanov in an interview with the Youth Internet Journal of the Moscow State University, &quot;Tatiana Day&quot;, explained the possible restoration of the Chudov Monastery and the Passion Monastery.

On 31 July 2014, president Vladimir Putin suggested restoring the Chudov Monastery and the Ascension Convent: &quot;As you know, the building that occupies this site [Building 14] was built in the 1930s, but previously there were two cloisters and a church here... That is how the idea came up of rather than restoring the 1930s building, returning the site to its historical appearance instead, with the two cloisters and the church. In today&#x27;s situation of course, they would be restored as cultural heritage monuments only.&quot; However, no plans exist to restore the monasteries as of 2025.

==Burials==

* Gennady of Novgorod
* Alexius, Metropolitan of Moscow
* Patriarch Hermogenes (since 1913 in the Assumption cathedral)
* Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich Romanov
* Boris Kurakin

<doc id="1231351" wikidata="Q979146" url="?curid=1231351" title="Conan Meriadoc">
<text>Conan Meriadoc (; ; ) is a legendary British Celtic leader credited with founding Brittany. Versions of his story circulated in both Brittany and Great Britain from at least the early 12th century, and supplanted earlier legends of Brittany&#x27;s foundation. His story is known in two major versions, which appear in the Welsh text known as &quot;The Dream of Macsen Wledig&quot;, and in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. Both texts associate him with Magnus Maximus (&quot;Macsen Wledic&quot;, reigned 383–388), a Roman usurper against the Valentinianic dynasty who was widely regarded as having deprived Britain of its defences when he took its legions to claim the imperial throne. Conan&#x27;s cousin or sister, Saint Elen, is said to have been Macsen Wledic&#x27;s wife.

==Early evidence==
The earliest undisputed evidence connecting Conan to the foundation of Brittany appears in the &quot;Life of Saint Gurthiern&quot;, included in the Kemperle Cartulary compiled between 1118 and 1127. This text traces the descent of Gurthiern back to the ancestor figure Beli Mawr, given as a son of Outham Senis (Outham the Old), the figure known in later sources as Eudaf Hen and Octavius. Outham is given another son, &quot;Kenan&quot; (an Old Welsh spelling of Conan), who is said to have been the founder of Brittany. This reference shows that the Conan story was known in Brittany from a comparatively early date, but certain evidence suggests that it was imported from Wales. The text&#x27;s compiler, Gurheden, says that his source for the information was one &quot;Iuthael son of Aidan&quot;; while the name &quot;Iuthael&quot; is a brittonic name known in Wales and Brittany as well as Devon and Cornwall, the Gaelic &quot;Aidan&quot; is not attested in early Brittany but is known in Wales. Additionally, Gurthiern&#x27;s genealogy corresponds strongly with the descent elsewhere attributed to the Welsh saint Cadoc, further suggesting a Welsh origin.

Conan Meriadoc also appears in the prologue to the Latin &quot;Life of Saint Goeznovius&quot;, though the date of this text is disputed. The prologue, the only part of the work still extant, survives in a copy by the French historian Pierre Le Baud (died 1505), but contains a passage claiming it was originally written in 1019 by a certain Guillaume, a servant of Bishop Eudo. This date has been defended by Gwenaël Leduc and Léon Fleuriot. However, Hubert Guillotel has argued that the text dates instead to the mid-12th century.

There is evidence that Conan Meriadoc figured into the brittonic prophetic tradition as a messianic saviour who would return to lead his people in a time of need. A &quot;Cynan&quot; appears in several prophetic poems, most notably the &quot;Armes Prydein&quot;, where he is named alongside Cadwaladr as a figure whose return is promised. Geoffrey of Monmouth, whose knowledge of this tradition is evinced in both the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; and the &quot;Vita Merlini&quot;, specifically identified this &quot;Cynan&quot; with Conan Meriadoc. Rachel Bromwich suggests that Geoffrey was relying on an older tradition identifying the founder of Brittany with the prophetic Cynan, and argues that this identification is made already in &quot;Armes Prydein&quot;. At the time &quot;Armes Prydein&quot; was composed, the Breton nobility under Alan II, Duke of Brittany had forged an alliance with Æthelstan, king of England, in the face of Viking attacks on their territory. Hywel Dda, then ruler of most of Wales, had also formed a similar relationship with Æthelstan at that time. In spite of this, the poet repeatedly refers to the men of &quot;Llydaw&quot; (Brittany) as part of his prophesied pan-Celtic union which will oust the English from Britain for good. Bromwich reads the line &quot;A chymot Cynan gan y gilyd&quot; (&quot;there will be concord between Cynan and his fellow&quot;) as a reference to the reunion of the Bretons and their leader Conan Meriadoc with their fellow Britons.

==Geoffrey and the &quot;Dream of Macsen&quot;==
The story of Conan is attested in several medieval sources, the most substantial versions being those included in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; and the Welsh tale known as &quot;The Dream of Macsen Wledig&quot;. Both of these tie Conan and the founding of Brittany to the story of the Roman usurper Magnus Maximus, though in both cases this is heavily embellished. In Geoffrey, Conan is the nephew of Octavius, King of the Britons (Welsh &quot;Eudaf Hen&quot;), and a potential heir to the throne. When the throne is offered instead to &quot;Maximianus&quot;, Geoffrey&#x27;s version of Magnus Maximus, Conan at first opposes him, but the two are reconciled after Maximianus&#x27; marriage to Octavius&#x27; daughter. Later Maximianus leads the armies of Britain to march on Rome, and he quickly conquers Armorica, where he establishes Conan as the king with instructions to found &quot;another Britain&quot;. He does so, and repels numerous attacks from the Gauls and Aquitanians, and asks for British wives for his men from Maximianus&#x27; regent Dionotus, with whose daughter, Saint Ursula, he was said to be &quot;most passionately in love&quot;, as reflected in her legends. Later, when Maximianus has been killed in Rome, his fleeing troops return to Armorica and join Conan&#x27;s settlement.

The version of the story given in &quot;The Dream of Macsen Wledig&quot; differs from the &quot;Historia&quot; account on a number of points. Though the text postdates Geoffrey, it contains material older than either version. In &quot;The Dream&quot;, Conan is the son, rather than nephew, of Eudaf Hen (Geoffrey&#x27;s Octavius), and the brother of Saint Elen. Maxen Wledig (Magnus Maximus), here portrayed as the rightful Roman Emperor rather than a usurper, sees Elen and her kingdom in a dream vision, and seeks her out and marries her. In this version Conan and his brother Afaon immediately become Maxen&#x27;s loyal associates, later helping him reclaim the throne of Rome. For this service the grateful Macsen gives Conan dispensation to lead his army to conquer whatever realm he wants. Conan chooses Armorica, where he kills all the men and replaces them with his own soldiers. He then orders the tongues of all the women cut out, lest their speech corrupt that of the Britons; a fanciful etymology connects this event with Welsh name of Brittany, &quot;Llydaw&quot;, supposedly from the Welsh &quot;lled-taw&quot; or &quot;half-silent&quot;.

==Later developments==
The Conan story became a dominant founding myth for the Bretons for hundreds of years. Earlier traditions of the foundation of the Brittonic settlement in Armorica are recorded in Gildas&#x27; &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot; and in the hagiographies of various saints. Especially important in this regard are the stories of the so-called Seven Founder Saints of Brittany, which were largely forgotten or overlooked after the spread of the Conan legend.

In the wake of Geoffrey and &quot;The Dream of Macsen&quot;, Conan subsequently appears as a founder-figure in several genealogies of Breton aristocratic families. He is venerated as the ancestor of the Rohans, according to the &quot;Life of Saint Meriadoc&quot;, the protagonist of which is said to have been descended from him. Meriadoc appears in one of the genealogies from Jesus College MS 20, which traces the descent of Geraint mab Erbin, king of Dumnonia in the West Country, back to &quot;Cynan map Eudaf Hen&quot;. In the Cornish miracle play &quot;Beunans Meriasek&quot;, Conan is a kinsman of Saint Meriasek who tries (unsuccessfully) to dissuade Meriasek from pursuing a religious life.

In the 15th century the Bretons used the Conan story as it appears in the &quot;Life of Saint Meriadoc&quot; to establish precedence for the Breton aristocracy over the kings of France. The story&#x27;s political impact declined with the Union of Brittany and France in 1532, and it thereafter declined in popularity. However, in the 17th century the Rohans used their supposed descent from Conan Meriadoc to seek status as &quot;foreign princes&quot; at the French court; King Louis XIV recognised their pedigree, but denied their foreign status. Beginning in the mid-18th century Breton historians attempted to establish the historical existence of Conan, though he is now regarded as a mythical figure.

=== 2012–2016 ===

=== 2008–2012 ===


=== 2004–2008 ===

In Romania&#x27;s 2004 legislative election, held on 28 November, no party won an outright majority. The Social Democratic Party (PSD) won the largest number of seats but is currently in opposition because the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ), the Romanian Humanist Party (which later became the Conservative Party), and the National Minorities formed a governing coalition, giving it 177 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (47.9% of the total). The Conservative Party (PC) withdrew in December 2006, meaning that the government lost the majority in the Chamber of Deputies. In April 2007, then national liberal Prime Minister, Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, dismissed the Democratic Party ministers from the government and formed a minority government with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania, marking the end of the Justice and Truth Alliance.

During the 2004–2008 legislature, the president of the Chamber of Deputies was Bogdan Olteanu from the National Liberal Party (PNL), who was elected on 20 March 2006, after the Chamber&#x27;s former president, Adrian Năstase, was forced by his own party (the Social Democratic Party, PSD) to step down amidst corruption allegations.

After the 2004 elections, several deputies from the PSD switched to other parties (including the governing Justice and Truth Alliance) or became independents, with the total number of PSD seats being reduced from 113 to 105. The number of Justice and Truth Alliance (DA) deputies also increased from 112 to 118, making it the largest formation in parliament as of October 2006. This changed again in December 2006, leaving the PSD with 107 seats and the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA) with 101. Since April 2007 the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA) has split leaving the two former members with 51 respectively 50 members. Deputies elected to the European Parliament in the 2007 election resigned, thus reducing the number of deputies to 314 as of 4 December 2007.

A new election was held in 2008. The table below gives the state of play before the 2008 election; parties in bold were part of the governing coalition. That coalition was tacitly supported by the PSD.

=== 2000–2004 ===

Elections to the Chamber of Deputies were held on 26 November 2000, in which the Social Democratic Party of Romania (PSD) won plurality. The governing majority was formed from the PSD and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ), which, with 182 members, made up 54.8% of seats. The president of the Chamber of Deputies during this period was Valer Dorneanu, who was elected on 15 December 2000. The distribution of seats was as follows:

<doc id="1231372" wikidata="Q1127788" url="?curid=1231372" title="Constantin Argetoianu">
<text>Constantin Argetoianu ( – 6 February 1955) was a Romanian politician, one of the best-known personalities of interwar Greater Romania, who served as the Prime Minister between 28 September and 23 November 1939. His memoirs, &quot;Memorii. Pentru cei de mâine. Amintiri din vremea celor de ieri&quot; (&quot;Memoirs. For those of tomorrow. Recollections of yesterday&#x27;s world&quot;)—a cross section of Romanian society, were made known for the sharp critique of several major figures in Romanian politics (using a sarcastic tone which had made his previous political speeches notorious).

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Craiova as the son of Army general , he trained in Law, Medicine, and Letters at the University of Paris, and later entered the diplomatic service (1897).

He was an exceptionally prosperous man (a noted Stock Exchange player and landowner in Breasta, Dolj County), and his frequent change in political allegiances was attributed by some of his contemporaries to his financial independence. In 1913 he served as a combat medic with the rank of captain in the Second Balkan War, where he faced a cholera epidemic.

===World War I===
A Freemason, Argetoianu was first elected to the Senate in 1914 as a Conservative Party representative, where he oscillated between the mainstream Conservatives of Petre P. Carp and the dissident group around Take Ionescu (the latter was welcoming Romania&#x27;s entry into World War I on the side of the Entente Powers, which Argetoianu also proposed).

Throughout 1918, during the final stages of the Romanian Campaign, Argetoianu was Justice Minister, sitting on the first Averescu cabinet (at the time when authorities had retreated to Iași, once the southern half of the country was occupied by Imperial German, Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian troops). He was also head of the Romanian delegation at the Peace preliminaries of Buftea, in 1918. The talks resulted in the punitive Treaty of Bucharest of May, which consecrated Romania&#x27;s defeat by the Central Powers. His actions at the time were later the subject of an epigram by Cincinat Pavelescu (Pavelescu expressed his belief that the treaty and Argetoianu&#x27;s views on fiscal policies were to be the subject of scorn for future generations):
===People&#x27;s Party===
Argetoianu followed Averescu into opposition to the Brătianu National Liberal Party (PNL) cabinet, and joined the People&#x27;s Party (PP) created by the former. He later documented the populist message of the movement, and left testimonies of Averescu&#x27;s spontaneous adulation by the crowds of peasants.

Argetoianu was Finance Minister and later Interior Minister in the second Averescu government of 1920. In March 1921, it was uncovered that an associate of his named Aron Schuller had attempted to contract a 20 million lire loan with a bank in Italy, using as collateral Romanian war bonds that he had illegally obtained from the Finance Ministry reserve. Argetoianu, who was still in charge at the time, became the target of attacks from the opposition group formed by the Romanian National Party and the Peasants&#x27; Party, being pressed by Virgil Madgearu and Grigore Iunian to explain himself (Iunian proposed a motion of no confidence, but the PNL continued to show its support for the PP).

===Clash with Communism and split with Averescu===
Argetoianu soon became noted for his anti-communist stance: he carried out arrests of those Socialist Party members who, during their party&#x27;s congress in May 1921, supported a maximalist platform and voted in favor of aligning their Socialist-Communist faction (future Communist Party of Romania) with the Comintern, citing the latter&#x27;s condemnation of Greater Romania; all those arrested were prosecuted in the Dealul Spirii Trial. Argetoianu later stated that the arrest lacked legal grounds, and indicated that he purposely gave the Socialist Gheorghe Cristescu approval to hold the congress as a means to incriminate the faction. Faced with mixed reactions inside the cabinet (Averescu hesitated, while the Minister of Justice Grigore Trancu-Iași refused to give him support), he ordered the move without his fellow ministers&#x27; prior knowledge, and thus faced them with a &quot;fait accompli&quot;.

The standoff between Averescu and the parliamentary opposition eventually witnessed a decisive incident: during a prolonged debate over Averescu&#x27;s proposal to nationalize enterprises in Reșița, Argetoianu addressed a mumbled insult to Madgearu; the PNL, seeing an opportunity for a return to power, expressed sympathy, and all opposition groups appealed to King Ferdinand, asking for Averescu&#x27;s recall (July 14, 1921).

Despite Averescu&#x27;s eventual defeat in December 1921, Argetoianu was kept in office by the Take Ionescu and Brătianu cabinets. During the spring of 1922, he ordered the killing of several Communist activists who were held in prison custody, including Leonte Filipescu, staging their attempts to flee from under escort as a pretext. Nevertheless, pressures on the revolutionary grouping were relaxed in summer, when King Ferdinand approved an amnesty and Argetoianu officially declared that &quot;communism is over in Romania&quot;.

===PND and PNL===

In 1923, after Brătianu again assumed power, he clashed with Averescu and proclaimed himself leader of the PP, being eventually expelled. Having joined Nicolae Iorga&#x27;s Democratic Nationalist Party (PND), he soon vehemently protested against the latter&#x27;s alliance with the Romanian National Party, and moved to the PNL.

Following the sudden death of Ion I. C. Brătianu in 1927, and choosing, in contrast to the policies of Dinu Brătianu, to support the new King Carol II in 1930, Argetoianu left the party and subsequently defined himself as an independent. In effect, he moved into the camp of politicians approving of an authoritarian regime around Carol. As the monarch&#x27;s relations with the traditional political class were souring, Argetoianu allegedly engaged in a campaign to draw new allegiances from other environments, aiding to establish a Romanian &quot;camarilla&quot; — it was even reported that, using the official commitment to neutral technocracy as a means to appoint his choice of people to positions of influence, he had recruited his fellow Bucharest Jockey Club members. Among his most vocal supporters at the time was the far right philosopher Nae Ionescu.

===Iorga cabinet and Agrarian Party===
He was again in charge of Internal Affairs and Finance from 1931 to 1932, during the Iorga government, when he took a harsh stance against the fascist Iron Guard, outlawing it and arresting some of its members (which led to a string of violent confrontations). Argetoianu was hotly contested as Finance Minister: faced with the widespread insolvency of small agricultural holdings in front of the Great Depression, he proposed a form of liquidation that was considered in breach of the 1923 Constitution. Various other issues forced Argetoianu to cease payments of salaries for civil servants at certain intervals, causing far-reaching problems.

The government was voted out of office in the elections of 1932, when Iorga was replaced by Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, a member of the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNŢ) who was himself challenged with solving the agrarian issue; Argetoianu subsequently founded the minor Agrarian Union Party, which, after the National Liberals returned to power with Ion G. Duca, remained a close associate of the king in his competition with traditional forces; when Duca was assassinated by the Iron Guard in the final days of 1933, Argetoianu, together with his former adversary, PNŢ dissident Grigore Iunian, and the National Agrarian Party&#x27;s Octavian Goga, was probably one of the king&#x27;s main options in his attempt to create an altogether new political establishment around the &quot;camarilla&quot;, relying on a compromise with Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (leader of the Iron Guard). Codreanu refused to accept negotiation, but Carol successfully approached the PNL&#x27;s &quot;young liberals&quot; faction, which came to power with Gheorghe Tătărescu (January 1934).

===Royal dictatorship and World War II===

The frequent target of attacks in the Iron Guard press, Argetoianu led his grouping until 1938, when, faced with the unstoppable rise of the Iron Guard, Carol banned all parties and established his National Renaissance Front (FRN).

His own short-lived FRN cabinet, established after that date, was, after Gheorghe Argeşanu&#x27;s the second in quick succession to the violent clash between the Guard and monarch (after the murder of Armand Călinescu by the former). The Argetoianu government was replaced by that of Tătărescu, who had to deal with the Soviet Union&#x27;s occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and was in turn replaced with Ion Gigurtu (Argetoianu, who remained influential throughout the period, began calling for a rapprochement between Romania and the Soviets).

Carol&#x27;s regime crumbled after the Second Vienna Award, when Romania had to cede Northern Transylvania to Hungary; it was replaced by the Iron Guard&#x27;s National Legionary State, which, itself repressed during the previous years, began a campaign of retaliation — like Tătărescu and several others, Argetoianu was kidnapped on November 27, 1940 in the wake of the Jilava Massacre, and faced assassination until being rescued by the intervention of Romanian Army officials.

Retreating from public life during World War II and the Ion Antonescu dictatorship (&quot;see Romania in World War II&quot;), Argetoianu left the country in the spring of 1944, settling in Switzerland. Romania&#x27;s withdrawal from the Axis in August and the start of Soviet occupation caused him to return in November, seeing an opportunity in the apparent decrease in the appeal of traditional parties and expanding on his vision of Romanian-Soviet cooperation. He was the subject of derision in the National Peasants&#x27; Party press (&quot;Dreptatea&quot; wrote of him: &quot;leading the intrigue in favor of a private property–based communism, a capitalist-based socialism, a mass-free democracy... The country is trustingly placing itself at your disposal. Here are your strings: pull them! Here are your back rooms: maneuver them! Here is your «people»: take it away!&quot;).

===UNMR, arrest, and death===

Attempting in vain to mediate between the Communists and the PNȚ, Argetoianu was rejected by both sides, and, in January 1947, formed his own grouping — the &quot;National Union for Work and Reconstruction&quot; (&quot;Uniunea Națională Muncă și Refacere&quot;, UNMR) —, alongside Nicolae Ottescu, Nicolae D. Cornățeanu, Zamfir Brătescu and others. It was kept under surveillance by the Communist-controlled Petru Groza government, and was infiltrated by the pro-Communist &quot;National-Agrarian Action&quot; (&quot;Acțiunea Național-Agrară&quot;, ANA). The UNMR disbanded over worries that Argetoianu was losing credibility with Soviet authorities—the group around Cornățeanu joined Premier Groza&#x27;s Ploughmen&#x27;s Front, while others entered the Union of Patriots.

Argetoianu, who was ill at the time and had just undergone surgery on his prostate, withdrew from public life for a second time. Referring to the commonly-held belief at the time that an American-led invasion of Eastern Europe would topple the Soviet-backed communist government (&quot;Vin americanii!&quot;), he exclaimed in April 1950, &quot;Even if they came with a wheelbarrow, they would have arrived by now.&quot; On the morning of May 6, 1950, he was arrested by the Securitate; while being taken away, he was heard saying: &quot;Man, you sure are tough, you communists, if you are afraid of a flatulent old man such as myself&quot;. He died in the infamous Sighet prison five years later, never having been put on trial. 

==Legacy==
In 1999, attorney and civil rights activist Monica Macovei, representing Argetoianu&#x27;s two granddaughters – Yvonne Oroveanu Niculescu and Constantina &quot;Dina&quot; Oroveanu – before court cleared Argetoianu of all charges, with prosecutor Mihai Carp admitting that Argetoianu&#x27;s detention had been an abuse.

A street in his native city, Craiova, is named after him, and so is a school in Argetoaia, Dolj County.

<text>Inter caetera (&#x27;Among other [works]&#x27;) was a papal bull issued by Pope Alexander VI on the 4 May 1493, which granted to the Catholic Monarchs King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile all lands to the &quot;west and south&quot; of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of any of the islands of the Azores or the Cape Verde islands.

It remains unclear whether the pope intended a &quot;donation&quot; of sovereignty or an infeudation or investiture. Differing interpretations have been argued since the bull was issued, with some arguing that it was only meant to transform the possession and occupation of land into lawful sovereignty. Others, including the Spanish crown and the conquistadors, interpreted it in the widest possible sense, deducing that it gave Spain full political sovereignty.

&quot;Inter caetera&quot; and its supplement &quot;Dudum siquidem&quot; (September 1493) are two of the Bulls of Donation. While these bulls purported to settle disputes between Spain and Portugal, they did not address the exploratory and colonial ambitions of other nations, which became more of an issue after the Protestant Reformation.

==Background==

Before Christopher Columbus received support for his voyage from Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain, he had first approached King John II of Portugal. The king&#x27;s scholars and navigators reviewed Columbus&#x27;s documentation, determined that his calculations grossly underestimated the diameter of the Earth and thus the length of the voyage, and recommended against subsidizing the expedition. Upon Columbus&#x27;s return from his first voyage to the Americas, his first landing was made in the Portuguese Azores; a subsequent storm drove his ship to Lisbon on 4 March 1493. Hearing of Columbus&#x27;s discoveries, the Portuguese king informed him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 Treaty of Alcáçovas. The treaty had been ratified with the 1481 papal bull &quot;Aeterni regis&quot;, which confirmed previous bulls of 1452 (&quot;Dum diversas&quot;), 1455 (&quot;Romanus Pontifex&quot;), and 1456 (&quot;Inter caetera&quot;), recognizing Portuguese territorial claims along the West African coast. It was the King&#x27;s understanding that the terms of the treaty acknowledged Portuguese claims to all territory south of the Canary Islands (which had been ceded to Spain).

Columbus&#x27;s arrival in supposedly Asiatic lands in the western Atlantic Ocean in 1492 threatened the unstable relations between Portugal and Spain. With word that King John was preparing a fleet to sail to the west, the King and Queen of Spain initiated diplomatic discussions over the rights to possess and govern the newly found lands. Spanish and Portuguese delegates met and debated from April to November 1493, without reaching an agreement.

Columbus was still in Lisbon when he sent a report of his success to the Spanish monarchs. On 11 April, the Spanish ambassador conveyed the news to Pope Alexander VI, a Spaniard and the former Administrator of Valencia, and urged him to issue a new bull favorable to Spain. At the time, Pope Alexander, as ruler of the Papal States, was embroiled in a territorial dispute with Ferdinand&#x27;s first cousin, Ferdinand I, King of Naples, hence he was amicable to any requests of Isabella and Ferdinand, to the extent that they could write to Columbus saying that if he thought it necessary, one of the bulls would be modified. They were at Barcelona, in close touch with Rome. The camera apostolica became almost an extension of the Spanish Court, which secured a rapid succession of bulls virtually liquidating Portuguese claims. The Pope issued edicts dated . The third superseded the first two. A final edict, &quot;Dudum siquidem&quot; of , supplemented the &quot;Inter caetera&quot;.

* The first bull, &quot;Inter caetera&quot;, dated 3 May, recognized Spain&#x27;s claim to any discovered lands not already held by a Christian prince, and protected Portugal&#x27;s previous rights. Both parties found this too vague.
* The second bull, &quot;Eximiae devotionis&quot;, also dated 3 May, granted to the kings of Castile and León and their successors the same privileges in the newly discovered land that had been granted to the kings of Portugal in the regions of Africa, and Guinea.
* The third bull, also entitled &quot;Inter caetera&quot;, dated 4 May, exhorts the Spanish monarchs to spread the faith west from a line drawn &quot;one hundred leagues towards the west and south from any of the islands commonly known as the Azores and Cape Verde&quot;. Diffie notes that it has been suggested that this change may have been prompted by the Portuguese ambassador.

The &quot;Inter caetera&quot; and the following Treaty of Tordesillas defined and delineated a zone of Spanish rights exclusive of Portugal. In relation to other states the agreement was legally ineffective (&quot;res inter alios acta&quot;). Spain&#x27;s attempts to persuade other European powers on the legal validity of the &quot;Inter caetera&quot; were never successful.

==Provisions==
&quot;Inter caetera&quot; states:
Among other works well pleasing to the Divine Majesty and cherished of our heart, this assuredly ranks highest, that in our times especially the Catholic faith and the Christian religion be exalted and be everywhere increased and spread, that the health of souls be cared for and that barbarous nations be overthrown and brought to the faith itself. ...[W]e ... assign to you and your heirs and successors, kings of Castile and Leon, ... all islands and mainlands found and to be found, discovered and to be discovered towards the west and south, by drawing and establishing a line from ... the north, ...to ...the south, ... the said line to be distant one hundred leagues towards the west and south from any of the islands commonly known as the Azores and Cape Verde.

The bull notes that the Isabella and Ferdinand &quot;had intended to seek out and discover certain islands and mainlands remote and unknown&quot; but had been otherwise engaged in the conquest of Granada.

The line of demarcation divided Atlantic zones only. Spain and Portugal could pass each other toward the west or east, respectively, on the other side of the globe and still possess whatever lands they were first to discover. The bull was silent regarding whether lands to the east of the line would belong to Portugal, which had only recently reached the southern tip of Africa (1488) and had not yet reached India (1498). These lands yet &quot;to be discovered&quot; lay beyond those along the west coast of Africa as far as Guinea, and were given to Portugal via the 1481 bull &quot;Aeterni regis&quot;, which had ratified the Treaty of Alcáçovas. For the time being, the question was in abeyance.

==Effects and aftermath==

An important but unanticipated effect of this papal bull and the Treaty of Tordesillas was that nearly all the Pacific Ocean and the west coast of North America were given to Spain.
King John II naturally declined to enter into a hopeless competition at Rome, and simply ignored the bulls, thus neither admitting their authority nor defying the Church. According to Oskar Spate, if Rome was in Ferdinand&#x27;s pocket, highly placed personages at the Spanish Court were in King John&#x27;s, and kept him well informed of its moves. Controlling the sea lanes from Spain to the Antilles and in possession of bases in the Azores and Madeira, Portugal occupied a strategic naval position and he chose to pursue negotiations.
Neither side paid any attention to Pope Alexander&#x27;s bulls. Instead, they negotiated the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, which moved the line further west to a meridian 370 leagues west of the Portuguese Cape Verde Islands, now explicitly giving Portugal all newly discovered lands east of the line.

In response to Portugal&#x27;s discovery of the Spice Islands in 1512, the Spanish put forward the idea, in 1518, that Pope Alexander had divided the world into two halves. By this time, however, other European powers had overwhelmingly rejected the notion that the Pope had the right to convey sovereignty of regions as vast as the New World. Even within Spain, influential voices such as Francisco de Vitoria had denounced the validity of the &quot;Inter caetera&quot;. While Spain never gave up its claims based on papal bulls, neither did the Spanish crown seek papal sanctions over the Atlantic Ocean line of demarcation. Rather, Spain negotiated directly with Portugal.

===&quot;Piis fidelium&quot;===
On 25 June 1493, King Ferdinand secured another papal bull, &quot;Piis fidelium&quot;, appointing him apostolic vicar in the Indies. Father Bernardo Buil of the Order of Minims left Cádiz for America on 25 September 1493, on the second Columbus expedition. Once on the island of Hispaniola, Buil saw the effects of the conquistadors and quarreled with Columbus over the harsh treatment of colonists and Indians. Seeing that the situation for evangelization and catechizing was impossible, Buil left for Spain, defeated, within six months on 3 December 1494. Two other friars whom he had left in the Americas returned to Spain in 1499.

==Legacy and reaction==
This authorization to take non-Christian peoples&#x27; lands was cited by U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall almost 300 years later as he was developing the discovery doctrine in international law.

In the 21st century, groups such as the Shawnee, Lenape, Taíno, and Kanaka Maoli organised protests and raised petitions seeking to repeal the papal bull &quot;Inter caetera&quot;, and to remind Catholic leaders of &quot;the record of conquest, disease and slavery in the Americas, sometimes justified in the name of Christianity&quot;, which they say has a devastating effect on their cultures today.

<text>Geiranger is a small tourist village in Sunnmøre region of Møre og Romsdal county in the western part of Norway. It is in the municipality of Stranda at the head of the Geirangerfjorden, which is a branch of the large Storfjorden. The nearest city is Ålesund. Geiranger is home to spectacular scenery, and has been named the best travel destination in Scandinavia by Lonely Planet. Since 2005, the Geirangerfjord area has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Seven Sisters waterfall is located just west of Geiranger, directly across another waterfall called &quot;The Suitor.&quot; Norwegian County Road 63 passes through the village. Geiranger Church is the main church for the village and surrounding area.

Geiranger is under constant threat from landslides from the mountain Åkerneset into the fjord. A collapse would cause a tsunami that could destroy downtown Geiranger. For this reason, sirens have been installed to warn residents if a landslide should occur.

==Name==
The Old Norse form of the name was . The suffix &quot;-angr&quot; (&#x27;fjord&#x27;) is a common element in Norwegian place names (see for instance Hardanger and Varanger). The first element could be the plural genitive of the Norse word &quot;geiri&quot; (&#x27;piece of land; field in a mountain side&#x27;) which is related to English &quot;gore&quot; (&#x27;spear-shaped piece of land&#x27;). This would then refer to the several small farms and fields lying in the steep mountain sides around the fjord. (See Knivsflå and Skageflå.)

==Tourism==
This third biggest cruise ship port in Norway, Geiranger receives 140 to 180 ships during the four-month tourist season. In 2012 some 300,000 cruise passengers visited Geiranger during the summer season. The Geiranger Port has a cruise terminal, a Seawalk, and 3–4 anchor positions depending on the size of the ships. Constructed in 2013, the Seawalk is a three-segment articulated floating pier. It is long and wide on 10 pontoons, which moves (like a floatable jetwalk) to accommodate up to 4,000 passengers per hour disembarking from a single ship. 

Several hundred thousand people pass through the village every summer, and tourism is the main business for the 250 people who live there permanently. There are four hotels and over ten camping sites. The tourist season stretches from May to early September. Tours of the nearby historic farms of Knivsflå and Skageflå are available from Geiranger.

Each year in June, the Geiranger – From Fjord to Summit event occurs. It comprises a half marathon run and a bicycle race, both starting from the sea level at the fjord and ending at the summit of Mount Dalsnibba, near the lake Djupvatnet. Since there is still a lot of snow left in the mountains at that time of year, the race is also called &quot;From Summer to Winter&quot;.

Nearest airport is Ørsta-Volda Airport, Hovden around 1 hour and 50 min away.

== In popular culture ==
* Released in August 2015, &quot;The Wave&quot; (&quot;Bølgen&quot;) is a Norwegian disaster movie based on the premise of a rock slide from the mountain Åkerneset inundating the town of Geiranger. A sequel,&quot;The Quake&quot; (&quot;Skjelvet&quot;) was released in 2018.

<text>The Vympel R-27 (NATO reporting name AA-10 [[Alamo]]) is a family of air-to-air missiles developed by the Soviet Union during the late Cold War-era. It remains in service with the Russian Aerospace Forces, air forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States and air forces of many other countries as the standard medium-range air-to-air missile despite the development of the more advanced R-77.

The R-27 is manufactured in infrared-homing (R-27T, R-27ET), semi-active radar homing (R-27R, R-27ER), and active-radar homing (R-27EA) versions. R-27 family missiles are produced by both Russian and Ukrainian manufacturers. The R-27 missile is carried by the Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 family fighters. The R-27 missile is also license-produced in China, though the production license was bought from Ukraine instead of Russia.

==Variants==
* R-27R: &quot;AA-10 Alamo-A&quot;, semi-active radar homing. Missile can be used at altitude (launch platform or target). Effective kill range for a target at same altitude: head-on, tail-on. Maximum range: . Maximum allowed vertical separation between target and launch platform: +/− .
* R-27R1: Export model of the R-27R. The missile has a maximum range of with warhead.
* R-27T: &quot;AA-10 Alamo-B&quot;, infrared homing, passive homing using the Avtomatika 9B-1032 (PRGS-27) IR seeker head. Missile can be used at altitude. Effective kill range for a target at same altitude: head-on, tail-on. Maximum range: . Maximum allowed vertical separation: +/− .
* R-27T1: Export model of the R-27T. The missile has a maximum range of with warhead.
* R-27ER: &quot;AA-10 Alamo-C&quot;, the semi-active-radar homing extended-range version. Missile can be used at altitude. Effective kill range for a target at same altitude: head-on, tail-on. Missile cannot be fired at altitude less than against a target with background earth, if launch range is less than . Maximum range: . Maximum allowed vertical separation: .
* R-27ER1: Export model of the R-27ER. The missile has a maximum range of with warhead.
* R-27ET: &quot;AA-10 Alamo-D&quot;, the infrared-homing extended-range version, Weight . Missile can be used at altitude. Effective kill range: head-on, tail-on. Maximum range: . Maximum allowed vertical separation: .
* R-27ET1: Export model of the R-27ET. The missile has a maximum range of with warhead.

R-27R and ER variants can be used in any meteorological conditions. Launch can made at less than 5 &quot;g&quot; overload and less than 50 deg/s roll rate. It is allowed to redesignate targets during flight, and can share target illumination with other aircraft.

R-27T and ET variants can be used out of cloudiness, at least 15 degrees away from the bearing of sun, and 4 degrees away from the bearing of moon and ground-based heat-contrasting conditions. In cases of maximum head-on range launches where lock-command cannot be utilized, missile can not be fired. Seeker must acquire target before launch. On the combat operations section of the Su-27 manual, this is especially recommended for head-on usage for passive attacks at targets with 0 degrees approach angle (i.e. another fighter moving to intercept), leaving target unalerted to the incoming missile. Launch can be made at 0 to 7 &quot;g&quot;, but limited to 6 &quot;g&quot; if roll induced slip is more than 2× diameter of the ball.

Other variants:
* R-27P &quot;AA-10 Alamo-E&quot;, passive radiation homing with a range of up to .
* R-27EP &quot;AA-10 Alamo-F&quot;, a longer range passive anti-radiation missile with a range of up to .
* R-27EA, active radar homing with 9B-1103K active seeker, range of &gt;.
* R-27EM, active radar homing with 9B-1103K active seeker, range of &gt;.

==Operational service==
===Ethiopia and Eritrea===
In the 1999 Eritrean-Ethiopian War, Eritrean MiG-29s fought Ethiopian Su-27s both piloted by Russian mercenaries. Only one R-27 fired by an Ethiopian Su-27 at an Eritrean MiG-29 proximity-fuzed near enough to the MiG that the damaged aircraft eventually crashed on landing.

===Russia and Ukraine===
During the war in Donbas, the Ukrainian Air Force claimed that one of its Su-25 was shot down by a Russian Aerospace Forces MiG-29 using a R-27T on 16 July 2014. Russian officials denied any involvement.

The R-27 was used by both sides during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===Yemen===
During the Yemeni Civil War (2015–present) Houthis have used R-27T missiles modified to serve as surface to air missiles. A video released on January 7, 2018, also shows a modified R-27T hitting a Saudi led coalition fighter on a Forward looking infrared camera. Houthi sources claim to have downed a F-15. Rebels later released footage showing an aircraft wreck, however serial numbers on the wreckage suggested that the downed aircraft was a Panavia Tornado, also operated by Saudi forces. On January 8, the Saudi Press Agency admitted the loss of an aircraft over Yemen, though it did not clarify whether it was a Tornado or an F-15, blaming the crash to &#x27;a technical issue&#x27; and reporting that the pilots ejected and were recovered by friendly forces.

On 21 March 2018, Houthi rebels released a video where they hit and possibly shot down a Saudi F-15 in Saada province. In the video a R-27T air to air missile adapted for surface to air use was launched, appearing to have successfully hit a jet. As in the video of the previous similar hit recorded on 8 January, the target, while clearly hit, did not appear to be downed. Saudi forces confirmed the hit, while saying the jet safely landed at a Saudi base. Saudi official sources confirmed the incident reporting that it happened at 3:48 pm local time after a surface-to-air defense missile was launched at the fighter jet from inside Saada airport.

<text>The Cray-2 is a supercomputer with four vector processors made by Cray Research starting in 1985. At 1.9 GFLOPS peak performance, it was the fastest machine in the world when it was released, replacing the Cray X-MP in that spot. It was, in turn, replaced in that spot by the Cray Y-MP in 1988.

The Cray-2 was the first of Seymour Cray&#x27;s designs to successfully use multiple CPUs. This had been attempted in the CDC 8600 in the early 1970s, but the emitter-coupled logic (ECL) transistors of the era were too difficult to package into a working machine. The Cray-2 addressed this through the use of ECL integrated circuits, packing them in a novel 3D wiring that greatly increased circuit density.

The dense packaging and resulting heat loads were a major problem for the Cray-2. This was solved in a unique fashion by forcing the electrically inert Fluorinert liquid through the circuitry under pressure and then cooling it outside the processor box. The unique &quot;waterfall&quot; cooler system came to represent high-performance computing in the public eye and was found in many informational films and as a movie prop for some time.

Unlike the original Cray-1, the Cray-2 had difficulties delivering peak performance. Other machines from the company, like the X-MP and Y-MP, outsold the Cray-2 by a wide margin. When Cray began development of the Cray-3, the company chose to develop the Cray C90 series instead. This is the same sequence of events that occurred when the 8600 was being developed, and as in that case, Cray left the company.

== Initial design ==
With the successful launch of his famed Cray-1, Seymour Cray turned to the design of its successor. By 1979 he had become fed up with management interruptions in what was now a large company, and as he had done in the past, decided to resign his management post and move to form a new lab. As with his original move to Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin from Control Data HQ in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Cray management understood his needs and supported his move to a new lab in Boulder, Colorado. Working as an independent consultant at these new Cray Labs, starting in 1980 he put together a team and started on a completely new design. This lab would later close, and a decade later a new facility in Colorado Springs would open.

Cray had previously attacked the problem of increased speed with three simultaneous advances: more functional units to give the system higher parallelism, tighter packaging to decrease signal delays, and faster components to allow for a higher clock speed. The classic example of this design is the CDC 8600, which packed four CDC 7600-like machines based on ECL logic into a 1 × 1 meter cylinder and ran them at an 8 ns cycle speed (125 MHz). Unfortunately, the density needed to achieve this cycle time led to the machine&#x27;s downfall. The circuit boards inside were densely packed, and since even a single malfunctioning transistor would cause an entire module to fail, packing more of them onto the cards greatly increased the chance of failure. Cooling the closely packed individual components also represented a major challenge.

One solution to this problem, one that most computer vendors had already moved to, was to use integrated circuits (ICs) instead of individual components. Each IC included a selection of components from a module pre-wired into a circuit by the automated construction process. If an IC did not work, another one would be tried. At the time the 8600 was being designed the simple MOSFET-based technology did not offer the speed Cray needed. Relentless improvements changed things by the mid-1970s, however, and the Cray-1 had been able to use newer ICs and still run at a respectable 12.5 ns (80 MHz). In fact, the Cray-1 was actually somewhat faster than the 8600 because it packed considerably more logic into the system due to the ICs&#x27; small size.

Although IC design continued to improve, the physical size of the ICs was constrained largely by mechanical limits; the resulting component had to be large enough to solder into a system. Dramatic improvements in density were possible, as the rapid improvement in microprocessor design was showing, but for the type of ICs used by Cray, ones representing a very small part of a complete circuit, the design had plateaued. In order to gain another 10-fold increase in performance over the Cray-1, the goal Cray aimed for, the machine would have to grow more complex. So once again he turned to an 8600-like solution, doubling the clock speed through increased density, adding more of these smaller processors into the basic system, and then attempting to deal with the problem of getting heat out of the machine.

Another design problem was the increasing performance gap between the processor and main memory. In the era of the CDC 6600 memory ran at the same speed as the processor, and the main problem was feeding data into it. Cray solved this by adding ten smaller computers to the system, allowing them to deal with the slower external storage (disks and tapes) and &quot;squirt&quot; data into memory when the main processor was busy. This solution no longer offered any advantages; memory was large enough that entire data sets could be read into it, but the processors ran so much faster than memory that they would often spend long times waiting for data to arrive. Adding four processors simply made this problem worse.

To avoid this problem the new design banked memory and two sets of registers (the B- and T-registers) were replaced with a 16 KWord block of the very fastest memory possible called a &quot;Local Memory,&quot; not a cache, attaching the four &quot;background processors&quot; to it with separate high-speed pipes. This Local Memory was fed data by a dedicated &quot;foreground processor&quot; which was in turn attached to the main memory through a Gbit/s channel per CPU; X-MPs by contrast had three, for two simultaneous loads and a store and Y-MP/C-90s had five channels to avoid the von Neumann bottleneck. It was the foreground processor&#x27;s task to &quot;run&quot; the computer, handling storage and making efficient use of the multiple channels into main memory. It drove the background processors by passing in the instructions they should run via eight 16-word buffers, instead of tying up the existing cache pipes to the background processors. Modern CPUs use a variation of this design as well, although the foreground processor is now referred to as the &quot;load/store unit&quot; and is not a complete machine unto its own.

Main memory banks were arranged in quadrants to be accessed at the same time, allowing programmers to scatter their data across memory to gain higher parallelism. The downside to this approach is that the cost of setting up the &quot;scatter/gather unit&quot; in the foreground processor was fairly high. Stride conflicts corresponding to the number of memory banks suffered a performance penalty (latency) as occasionally happened in power-of-2 FFT-based algorithms. As the Cray 2 had a much larger memory than Cray 1s or X-MPs, this problem was easily rectified by adding an extra unused element to an array to spread the work out.

=== Packed circuit boards and new design ideas ===
Early Cray-2 models soon settled on a design using large circuit boards packed with ICs. This made them extremely difficult to solder together, and the density was still not enough to reach their performance goals. Teams worked on the design for about two years before even Cray himself &quot;gave up&quot; and decided it would be best if they simply canceled the project and fired everyone working on it. Les Davis, Cray&#x27;s former design collaborator who had remained at Cray headquarters, decided it should be continued at low priority. After some minor personnel movements, the team continued on much as before.

Six months later Cray had his &quot;eureka&quot; moment. He called the main engineers together for a meeting and presented a new solution to the problem. Instead of making one larger circuit board, each &quot;card&quot; would instead consist of a 3-D stack of eight, connected together in the middle of the boards using pins sticking up from the surface (known as &quot;pogos&quot; or &quot;z-pins&quot;). The cards were packed right on top of each other, so the resulting stack was only about 30  mm high.

With this sort of density there was no way any conventional air-cooled system would work; there was too little room for air to flow between the ICs. Instead the system would be immersed in a tank of a new inert liquid from 3M, Fluorinert. The cooling liquid was forced sideways through the modules under pressure, and the flow rate was roughly one inch per second. The heated liquid was cooled using chilled water heat exchangers and returned to the main tank. Work on the new design started in earnest in 1982, several years after the original start date.

While this was going on the Cray X-MP was being developed under the direction of Steve Chen at Cray headquarters, and looked like it would give the Cray-2 a serious run for its money. In order to address this internal threat, as well as a series of newer Japanese Cray-1-like machines, the Cray-2 memory system was dramatically improved, both in size as well as the number of &quot;pipes&quot; into the processors. When the machine was eventually delivered in 1985, the delays had been so long that much of its performance benefits were due to the faster memory. Purchasing the machine really made sense only for users with huge data sets to process.

The first Cray-2 delivered possessed more physical memory (256 MWord) than all previously delivered Cray machines combined. Simulation moved from a 2-D realm or coarse 3-D to a finer 3-D realm because computation did not have to rely on slow virtual memory. 

== Uses and successors ==
The Cray-2 was predominantly developed for the United States Departments of Defense and Energy. Uses tended to be for nuclear weapons research or oceanographic (sonar) development. However, the first Cray-2 (serial number 1) was used at the National Magnetic Fusion Energy Computer Center at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for unclassified energy research. It also found its way into civil agencies (such as NASA Ames Research Center), universities, and corporations worldwide. For example, Ford and General Motors both used the Cray-2 for processing complex Finite Element Analysis models of car bodyshells, and for performing virtual crash testing of bodyshell components prior to production.

The Cray-2 would have been superseded by the Cray-3, but due to development problems only a single Cray-3 was built and it was never paid for. The spiritual descendant of the Cray-2 is the Cray X1, offered by Cray.

=== Comparison to later computers ===
In 2012, Piotr Luszczek (a former doctoral student of Jack Dongarra), presented results showing that an iPad 2 matched the historical performance of the Cray-2 on an embedded LINPACK benchmark.

==Trivia==
Due to the use of liquid cooling, the Cray-2 was given the nickname &quot;Bubbles&quot;, and common jokes around the computer made reference to this unique system. Gags included &quot;No Fishing&quot; signs, cardboard depictions of the Loch Ness Monster rising out of the heat exchanger tank, plastic fish inside the exchanger, etc. The power consumption of the Cray-2 was 150–200 kW. Research conducted at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the early 1990s indicated that to a limited extent the perfluorinated polyether used to cool Cray-2 circuits would break down to form the extremely toxic gas perfluoroisobutylene. At the time, Cray had created a poster showing the transparent &quot;bubble chamber&quot; that the cooling fluid was run through for visual effect, with a spill of the same material glistening on the floor—the joke was that if this actually occurred, the facility would have to be evacuated. The manufacturer of the liquid developed a scrubber that could be placed in line with the pump that would catalytically degrade this toxic breakdown product. 

Each vertical stack of logic modules sat above a stack of power modules which powered 5 volt busbars, each of which delivered about 2200 amps. The Cray-2 was powered by two motor-generators, which took in 480 V three-phase.

<text>Waheed Murad (; 2 October 1938 – 23 November 1983), also known as Chocolate Hero, was a Pakistani film actor, producer and script writer. Famous for his charming expressions, attractive personality, tender voice and unusual talent for acting, Murad was considered one of the most famous and influential actors of South Asia

Murad was born in Sialkot, Pakistan. He graduated from the S. M. Arts College Karachi, and then earned a master&#x27;s degree in English literature from University of Karachi. He started his film career in a cameo in 1959 in the film &quot;Saathi&quot; when he was 21 years old. The film, &quot;Armaan&quot;, which was produced by him, was the first Pakistani film to complete 75 weeks in cinemas. Murad is the only actor of film industry to secure the highest number of platinum, diamond, golden and silver jubilees. He mesmerized Pakistani nation during 1960s and 1970s more than anyone before or after and is considered to be evergreen chocolate hero of Pakistan&#x27;s silver screen history. He acted in 125 feature films and earned 32 film awards.

In November 2010, 27 years after his death, the Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari posthumously awarded him the Sitara-e-Imtiaz, the third highest honour and civilian award by the State of Pakistan, given in the fields of literature, arts, sports, medicine, or science.
 On 2 October 2019, Google celebrated Murad&#x27;s 81st birthday with a doodle on its homepage for Pakistan, India and several other countries.

== Early life ==
Murad was an only child and grew up in Karachi. His mother was Shireen Murad (a Christian from Bikaner who had converted to Islam), and his father was Nisar Murad, a film distributor in Bombay, both of whom had migrated to Karachi before the partition of India (1947). He did graduation from &quot;S. M. Arts College&quot;, Karachi, and then masters in English literature from University of Karachi. His father was a Punjabi whose family belonged to the cultural elite of Sialkot.

Murad&#x27;s ancestors had migrated from the Bahmani Sultanate in southern India to Kashmir and eventually settled in Sialkot in the 18th-century. Where Murad&#x27;s grandfather Zahoor Murad, an advocate and a social activist, adopted the surname &quot;Murad&quot; in 1887. The Murads also claimed Turkish ancestry; claiming that one of their ancestors, Murat, was a soldier of Ottoman-origin serving in the Mughal Army who settled in Punjab.

== Film career ==

Waheed Murad started his film career by joining his father&#x27;s established &#x27;Film Art&#x27; in 1961 as producer of the film &quot;Insan Badalta Hai&quot;. In his second film as producer &quot;Jab se dakha hai tumhein&quot; he cast Darpan with Zeba as heroine. Afterwards, Darpan most of the time started coming late at studio. Zeba suggested Waheed to cast himself as hero in his next film. Waheed was not ready to sign himself in his own movies. But when the same suggestion came from his old good friend Pervaiz Malik, he accepted it on the condition that if Zeba would be his co-star, Zeba accepted in return (according to Zeba). As a result, he firstly appeared in a supporting role in 1962&#x27;s &quot;Aulad&quot;. The film was directed by his friend S.M. Yousuf. &quot;Aulad&quot; got much more acclaims from critics, and it also got the Nigar award in the best film&#x27;s category for the year. &quot;Heera aur pathar&quot; was his first movie as a leading actor. He got the Nigar award in the Best Actor category for the same film.

In 1966, he produced and acted in &quot;Armaan&quot;. The film broke all the box office records at that time and completed 75 weeks in theatres. The films&#x27; songs were sung by Ahmed Rushdi. Murad received two Nigar awards for the categories best producer and best actor for the film.

In 1967, he appeared as the leading actor in films like &quot;Devar Bhabi&quot;, &quot;Doraha&quot;, &quot;Insaaniyat&quot; and &quot;Maan baap&quot;.
From 1964 to 1968, Murad and Pervaiz Malik made &quot;Heera Aur Pathar&quot;, &quot;Armaan&quot;, &quot;Ehsaan&quot;, &quot;Doraha&quot; and &quot;Jahan tum wahan hum&quot;. The combination of Waheed Murad, Pervaiz Malik, Masroor Anwar, Sohail Rana, Ahmed Rushdi and Zeba created a number of films. Waheed Murad brought Malik, Anwar and Rana under the umbrella of &#x27;Film Arts&#x27;. Film Arts broke up and Pervaiz Malik started creating his own projects with new actors. A total of seven films, including two films, i.e., &quot;Usey dekha usey chaha&quot; and &quot;Dushman&quot; released after a long gap of 6 years in 1974, were produced with the combination of Waheed and Pervaiz (but not under &#x27;Film Art&#x27; Production).

In 1969, Waheed produced, wrote and directed the movie &quot;Ishaara&quot;. It was released in 1969. Other co-stars included Shabnam, Rozina, Aliya, Talish and Mustafa Qureshi. Murad received a Nigar award in the best actor category for the film.

In his 25-year career, Murad paired with many actresses like Zeba, Shamim Ara, Rani, Naghma, Aaliya, Sangeeta, Kaveeta, Aasia, Shabnam, Deeba, Babra Sharif, &quot;Rukhsana&quot;, &quot;Bahar Begum&quot; and Neelo. He acted in a total of 124 films (two were released after his death), of which 38 were black and white and 86 were in colour. He also appeared in six films as a guest star including his first and shortest appearance in 1959&#x27;s &quot;Saathi&quot;. He acted in 115 Urdu films, 8 Punjabi films and 1 Pushto film, and earned 32 film awards including ones for best producer and for best actor.

=== Film Art productions ===
Waheed Murad produced eleven films under his father&#x27;s company Film Art. He was the youngest film producer in the Pakistani film industry at that time. Most of his produced films were either Golden Jubilee or Silver Jubilee. During the 1960s and early 1970s, he produced films like &quot;Insaan Badalta Hai&quot; (1961) (his first film as producer), &quot;Armaan&quot; (1966), &quot;Ehsaan&quot; (1967), &quot;Naseeb Apna Apna&quot; (1970) and &quot;Mastana Mahi&quot; (Punjabi film of 1971). However, after &quot;Mastana Mahi&quot;, he produced no film except &quot;Hero&quot; which was produced in the 1980s and was released after his death.

As a director, he had directed as well as produced &quot;Ishaara&quot; (1969) with co-star Deeba.

==Playback singers==
In Waheed&#x27;s career, most of the songs picturised by him were sung by Ahmed Rushdi. He sang more than 200 duet and solo songs for him. Other playback singers who provided voice for him were Mehdi Hassan, Masood Rana, Saleem Raza, Akhlaq Ahmed, Mujeeb Aalam, Asad Amanat Ali Khan, Bashir Ahmad, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan and A Nayyar.

In August 2018, &quot;Coke Studio&quot; produced a remake of Ahmed Rushdi&#x27;s first South Asian pop song &quot;Ko Ko Korina&quot;, originally lip-sync by Waheed Murad in the 1966 film &quot;Armaan&quot;, in the voices of Mustehsan and Ahad Raza Mir. Their rendition of this Pakistani classic was widely criticized. Within a few days of the video being released on YouTube, it became the most-disliked video in the music show&#x27;s 11-year history. Waheed Murad&#x27;s son Adil Murad also reacted to the outcry by apologizing to the song&#x27;s fans for the controversial remake. In 2022, &quot;Ko Ko Korina&quot;, featured in the opening scene of American series &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; and won top ratings.

== Later life ==
By the late 1970s, Waheed was being cast in supporting roles either with Nadeem or with Mohammad Ali. Most of the leading heroines like Zeba, Shabnam and Nisho were not allowed to play lead roles with Waheed by their husbands. Pervaiz Malik wrote in a local newspaper: &quot;Not even once during that time [did] Waheed come to me seeking work in my films. Waheed was becoming depressed. His close friends revealed that he was becoming addicted to alcohol, oral tobacco and sleeping pills. Even his domestic life suffered and his wife Salma left for the United States. A combination of bad habits and stress caused ulceration in Waheed&#x27;s stomach in 1981. He suffered from bleeding and had to undergo stomach removal to save his life. His many fans came to the hospital to donate blood to save his life. Although, he recovered, he lost a significant amount of weight. Even then, Iqbal Akhtar and Iqbal Yousuf, who proved to be real friends in difficult times, cast Waheed Murad in their movies. Waheed appeared old and charmless in &quot;Dil ney phir yaad keya&quot; and &quot;Ghairao&quot;. Even his loyal admirers felt that it was all over for him.&quot;

In 1983, Anwar Maqsood, a TV writer and anchor and a close friend, invited Waheed to his TV comedy show &quot;Silver Jubilee&quot;.

Babra Sharif, revealed that during the filming of a scene of &quot;Hero&quot;, Waheed lost his balance while walking toward her and fell down. He took several minutes to catch his breath prior to standing up on his feet again.

In July 1983, Waheed was driving his car too fast and struck a tree. He was left with a scar on his face. A few days after the accident, Waheed asked his friend Pervez Malik for a role. Malik said, &quot;Get better and you will be the lead in my next film.&quot; He replied, &quot;You give me the role and I will get better&quot;. He was going to Karachi to get the scar fixed to complete the last few scenes of &quot;Hero&quot; when he met the chief editor, Ilyas Rasheedi, of the film magazine &#x27;Nigar&#x27; at the airport. Rasheedi wrote in his magazine:

By chance a famous film producer was also present in the waiting area and Waheed put him on the spot by asking if he had a role for him for Javed Sheikh&#x27;s father in his movie. The producer had a difficult time dodging Waheed.
=== Last days and death ===
Waheed&#x27;s son Aadil was in Karachi staying with his grandmother. A day before his face surgery, Waheed celebrated his son&#x27;s birthday. He bought several gifts for Aadil and wished him a happy year. 

He returned late to spend the night at Anita Ayub&#x27;s mother Mumtaz Ayub&#x27;s home. When Waheed did not wake up until late, the door had to be forced open and Waheed was found lying on the floor, dead for several hours. A paan leaf with an unidentified substance in it was found in his mouth. It is not clear if the cause of death was a heart attack or suicide. Waheed was buried near his father&#x27;s grave in Gulberg Graveyard in Lahore.

== Personal life ==
Waheed Murad married Salma, the daughter of a Karachi-based industrialist, on 17 September 1964. They had two daughters, Aaliya and Sadia, and one son, (Adil). Sadia died in infancy.

== Awards and honours ==
On 2 October 2019, Google celebrated Murad&#x27;s 81st birthday with a doodle on its homepage for Pakistan. At PTV Awards in 2012 on 11 June at 17th PTV Awards tributes were paid to him and he was awarded PTV Pakistani Legend Award which was given to his son Adil Murad. The Government of Pakistan named a street and intersection after him in Lahore on 16 August 2021.

<text>The talwar (), also spelled talwaar and tulwar, is a type of curved sword or sabre from the Indian subcontinent.

==Etymology and classification==
The word &quot;talwar&quot; originated from the Sanskrit word &quot;taravāri&quot; () which means &quot;one-edged sword&quot;. It is the word for &quot;sword&quot; in several related languages, such as Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Nepali, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi, etc. and as () in Bengali.

Like many swords from around the world with an etymology derived from a term meaning simply &#x27;sword&#x27;, the talwar has in scholarship, and in museum and collector usage, acquired a more specific meaning. However, South Asian swords, while showing a rich diversity of forms, suffer from relatively poor dating (so developmental history is obscure) and a lack of precise nomenclature and classification. The typical talwar is a type of sabre, characterised by a curved blade (without the radical curve of some Persian swords), possessing an all-metal hilt with integral quillons and a disc-shaped pommel. This type of hilt is sometimes called the &#x27;Indo-Muslim hilt&#x27;, or &#x27;standard Indian hilt&#x27;. Talwars possessing only slightly curved blades can be called &quot;sirohi&quot;. However, many other variations exist. Swords with straight blades and the disc-pommel hilt are usually referred to as &#x27;straight-bladed talwars&#x27; (though the word &quot;dhup&quot; is also used), while those with the same hilt but yatagan-type forward-curved blades are termed &#x27;sosun patta&#x27;. Swords with sabre-blades and all metal Indo-Muslim hilts, but having the pommel in the shape of the head of an animal or bird, instead of the disc, are termed talwar, without being differentiated by name.

==History==
The talwar belongs to the same family of curved swords as the Persian shamshir, the Turkish kilij, Arabian saif and the Afghan pulwar, all such swords being originally derived from earlier curved swords developed in Turkic Central Asia. The talwar typically does not have as radical a curve as the shamshir and only a very small minority have the expanded, stepped yelman (a sharp back edge on the distal third of the blade) typical of the kilij.

The talwar has a distinctive, all-metal, Indo-Muslim hilt, developed in Medieval western India. The increasing influence in India of Turco-Afghan, and later Turco-Mongol, dynasties (employing Persian and Central Asian arms) in the Late Medieval and subsequent eras led to ever greater use of sabre-like, curved swords. By Mughal times, the talwar had become the most popular form of sword in the Subcontinent. The talwar was the product of the marriage of the curved blade derived from Turco-Mongol and Persian swords and the native all-metal Indo-Muslim hilt.

==Characteristics==
The talwar was produced in many varieties, with different types of blades. Some blades are very unusual, from those with double-pointed tips (zulfiqar) to those with massive blades (sometimes called tegha – often deemed to be executioner&#x27;s swords but on little evidence). However, all such blades are curved, and the vast majority of talwars have blades more typical of a generalised sabre. As noted above, swords with blades other than curved sabre-blades, or possessing hilts radically different from the Indo-Muslim type are usually differentiated by name, though usage is not entirely consistent.

Many examples of the talwar exhibit an increased curvature in the distal half of the blade, compared to the curvature nearer the hilt. Also relatively common is a widening of the blade near the tip (often without the distinct step [latchet] to the back of the blade, characteristic of the yelman of the kilij). The blade profile of the British Pattern 1796 light cavalry sabre is similar to some examples of the talwar, and it has been suggested that the talwar may have contributed to the design of the British sabre.

A typical talwar has a wider blade than the shamshir. Late examples often had European-made blades, set into distinctive Indian-made hilts. The hilt of the typical talwar, is of the Indo-Muslim type, and is often termed a &quot;disc hilt&quot; from the prominent disc-shaped flange surrounding the pommel. The pommel often has a short spike projecting from its centre, sometimes pierced for a cord to secure the sword to the wrist. The hilt incorporates a simple cross-guard which frequently has a slender knucklebow attached. The hilt is usually entirely of iron, though brass and silver hilts are found, and is connected to the tang of the blade by a very powerful adhesive resin. This resin, or &quot;lac&quot;, is derived from the peepal tree, it is softened by heating and, when cooled, it sets solidly. More ornate examples of the talwar often show silver or gold plated decoration in a form called &quot;koftgari&quot;. Talwars of princely status can have hilts of gold, profusely set with precious stones, one such, preserved at the Baroda Palace Armoury, is decorated with 275 diamonds and an emerald.

==Use==
The talwar was used by both cavalry and infantry. The grip of the talwar is cramped and the prominent disc of the pommel presses into the wrist if attempts are made to use it to cut like a conventional sabre. These features of the talwar hilt result in the hand having a very secure and rather inflexible hold on the weapon, enforcing the use of variations on the very effective &quot;draw cut&quot;. The fact that the talwar does not have the kind of radical curve of the shamshir indicates that it could be used for thrusting as well as cutting purposes. The blades of some examples of the talwar widen towards the tip. This increases the momentum of the distal portion of the blade when used to cut; when a blow was struck by a skilled warrior, limbs could be amputated and persons decapitated. Because of this attribute, the talwar was also used for executions in some regions. The spike attached to the pommel could be used for striking the opponent in extreme close quarter circumstances when it was not always possible to use the blade. Due to the presence of a blunted ricasso the talwar can be held with the fore-finger wrapped around the lower quillon of the cross guard.

<text>New Ash Green is a village in the Sevenoaks District of Kent, England. It is located 8 miles south west of Gravesend.

==History==
Building of the village began in 1967, with Span as the developer and Eric Lyons as the designer. The architectural design of New Ash Green was innovative for its time, and its original concept was intended as a prototype for a new way of living in the latter twentieth century. The first buildings were created to be airy, pleasant and modern. There was generous landscaping and cars were separated from pedestrians in the streets and in the shopping precinct. The village is arranged in twenty four neighbourhoods. Punch Croft and Over Minnis are some of the original Span-designed sections.

The development soon ran into difficulties. Originally, the Greater London Council was going to buy 450 of the properties for renting. This idea was dropped when the leadership of the GLC went into Conservative hands. This reduced the financial viability of the development and of the planned social mix of residents. Another problem in the early years was that some lenders were sceptical about the unconventional design of the properties and would not give mortgages.

Span, the original developer, sold the project to Bovis in 1971 for £2.65 million. Bovis increased the size of the development, increasing density and giving less attention to design or provision of public space.

==Facilities==
New Ash Green is a quiet residential area. It has a rugby club, épée fencing and air pistol shooting indoor, tennis club, football club, Ash Green Sports Centre including a gym, shops, children&#x27;s parks, a primary school, a fire station, a special needs school and many more public buildings.

The shopping centre became run-down due to lack of maintenance from overseas absentee landlords. Plans were put forward in 2008 to redesign the village&#x27;s shops.

==Transport==
===Rail===
The nearest National Rail station to New Ash Green is Longfield, located 2.3 miles away.

===Buses===
New Ash Green is served by Arriva Kent Thameside route 489. It connects it with Gravesend &amp; Longfield.

<text>Hedley Norman Bull (10 June 1932 – 18 May 1985) was Professor of International Relations at the Australian National University, the London School of Economics and the University of Oxford until his death from cancer in 1985. He was Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at Oxford from 1977 to 1985, and died there.

==Biography==
Bull was born in Sydney, Australia, where he attended Fort Street High School. He went on to study history and philosophy at the University of Sydney, where he was strongly influenced by the philosopher John Anderson. In 1953, Bull left Australia to study politics at Oxford, and after two years he was appointed to an assistant lectureship in international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).

In 1965, Bull was appointed director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Unit of the British Foreign Office, forfeiting his Australian identity for British citizenship. Two years later, in 1967, he was appointed to a professorship of international relations at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra.

In 1977, Bull published his main work, &quot;The Anarchical Society&quot;. It is widely regarded as a key textbook in the field of international relations and is also seen as the central text in the so-called &quot;English School&quot; of international relations. In this book, he argues that despite the anarchical character of the international arena, it is characterised by the formation of not only a system of states, but a society of states. His requirements for an entity to be called a state are that it must claim sovereignty over (i) a group of people (ii) a defined territory, and that it must have a government. States form a system when they have a sufficient degree of interaction and effect on one another&#x27;s decisions, so as they &quot;behave—at least in some measure—as parts of a whole.&quot; A system of states can exist without it also being a society of states. A society of states comes into existence &quot;when a group of states, conscious of certain common interests and common values, form a society in the sense that they conceive themselves to be bound by a common set of rules in their relations with one another, and share in the working of common institutions.&quot;

The society of states is a way for Bull to analyse and assess possibilities of order in world politics. He continues his argument by giving the concept of order in social life, and the mechanisms of: the balance of power, international law, diplomacy, war and the great powers central roles. He finally concludes that, despite the existence of possible alternative forms of organization, the states system is our best chance of achieving order in world politics.

<text>The non-governmental organization American Capital of Culture selects one city or state in the Americas annually to serve as the American Capital of Culture for a period of one year. The organization&#x27;s leaders claim the initiative is based closely on the European Capital of Culture program; it enjoys the backing of the Organization of American States, but the OAS is not involved in the selection process.

The organization was founded in 1998 with the objectives to raise awareness of culture in the Americas and to promote the city selected as the Capital of Culture for the year. The chosen city is publicized on the television networks Antena 3 and the Discovery network.

While the NGO claims that the designation &quot;is aimed at all the countries of the Americas&quot;, the 26 locations (includes two in 2003) designated as the American Capital of Culture have only been chosen from Latin America and the Caribbean. Furthermore, the designation has increasingly become Mexico-centric; Mexico has dominated the program since 2014, being given the designation six times in the 11 years from 2014 to 2024.

<text>Paul Michael Kennedy (born 17 June 1945) is a British historian specialising in the history of international relations, economic power and grand strategy. He is on the editorial board of numerous scholarly journals and writes for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and many foreign-language newspapers and magazines. His monthly column on current global issues is distributed worldwide by the Tribune Content Agency.

He has published on the history of British foreign policy and great power struggles, emphasizing the changing economic power base that undergirds military and naval strength, noting how declining economic power leads to reduced military and diplomatic weight.

==Life==
Kennedy was born in Wallsend, Northumberland, and attended St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne. Subsequently, he graduated with first-class honours in history from Newcastle University and obtained his doctorate from St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, under the supervision of A. J. P. Taylor and John Andrew Gallagher. He was a member of the History Department at the University of East Anglia between 1970 and 1983. He is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, a former visiting fellow of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany. In 2007–2008, Kennedy was the Phillipe Roman Professor of History and International Affairs at the London School of Economics.

In 1983 he was named the J. Richardson Dilworth professor of British History at Yale. He is now also the Director of International Security Studies and along with John Lewis Gaddis and Charles Hill, teaches the Studies in Grand Strategy course there. In 2012, Professor Kennedy began teaching a course at Yale entitled &quot;Military History of the West Since 1500&quot;, elaborating on his presentation of military history as inextricably intertwined with economic power and technological progress.
His most well known book, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers&quot;, assesses the interaction between economics and strategy over the past five centuries. The book was very well received by fellow historians, with A. J. P. Taylor labelling it &quot;an encyclopaedia in itself&quot; and Sir Michael Howard crediting it as &quot;a deeply humane book in the very best sense of the word&quot;.
It has been translated into 23 languages.

In his 2006 book &quot;The Parliament of Man&quot;, Kennedy contemplates the past and future of the United Nations.

In 2010 he delivered the first Lucy Houston Lecture in Cambridge on the subject of &quot;Innovation and Industrial Regeneration&quot;.

==Honours==
Kennedy was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1989 and the American Philosophical Society in 1991. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2001 and elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 2003. The National Maritime Museum awarded him its Caird Medal in 2005 for his contributions to naval history. Kennedy was named the US Naval War College&#x27;s Hattendorf Prize Laureate for 2014.

==Interpretations==

===&quot;The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers&quot;===

In &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers&quot; (1987), Kennedy argues that economic strength and military power have been highly correlated in the rise and fall of major nations since 1500. He shows that expanding strategic commitments lead to increases in military expenditures that eventually overburden a country&#x27;s economic base, and cause its long-term decline. His book reached a wide audience of policy makers when it suggested that the United States and the Soviet Union were presently experiencing the same historical dynamics that previously affected Spain, the Netherlands, France, Great Britain, and Germany, and that the United States must come to grips with its own &quot;imperial overstretch&quot;.

However, the Cold War ended two years after Kennedy&#x27;s book appeared, validating his thesis regarding the Soviet Union, but leaving the United States as the sole superpower and, apparently, at the peak of its economy. 

In the text, Kennedy predicted the rise of China, noting that it was undergoing economic development which could transform the country in decades and that it was &quot;only a matter of time&quot; before China became a great power.

Nau (2001) contends that Kennedy&#x27;s realist model of international politics underestimates the power of national, domestic identities or the possibility of the ending of the Cold War and the growing convergence of democracy and markets resulting from the democratic peace that followed.

===World War I===

In explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, Kennedy (1980) recognised it was critical for war that Germany became economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany&#x27;s reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of neutral Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of France (pp. 457–62). Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London&#x27;s fear that a repeat of 1870, when Prussia and the German states smashed France, would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy-makers insisted that that would be a catastrophe for British security.

<doc id="1231464" wikidata="Q585911" url="?curid=1231464" title="Tropical sprue">
<text>Tropical sprue is a malabsorption disease commonly found in tropical regions, marked with abnormal flattening of the villi and inflammation of the lining of the small intestine. It differs significantly from coeliac sprue. It appears to be a more severe form of environmental enteropathy.

==Signs and symptoms==
The illness usually starts with an attack of acute diarrhoea, fever and malaise following which, after a variable period, the patient settles into the chronic phase of diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, weight loss, anorexia, malaise, and nutritional deficiencies.
The symptoms of tropical sprue are:
* Diarrhoea
* Steatorrhoea or fatty stool (often foul-smelling and whitish in colour)
* Indigestion
* Cramps
* Weight loss and malnutrition
* Fatigue

Left untreated, nutrient and vitamin deficiencies may develop in patients with tropical sprue. These deficiencies may have these symptoms:
* Vitamin A deficiency: hyperkeratosis or skin scales
* Vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies: anaemia, numbness, and tingling sensation
* Vitamin D and calcium deficiencies: spasm, bone pain, muscle weakness
* Vitamin K deficiency: bruises

==Cause==
The cause of tropical sprue is not known. It may be caused by persistent bacterial, viral, amoebal, or parasitic infections. Folic acid deficiency, effects of malabsorbed fat on intestinal motility, and persistent small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may combine to cause the disorder. A link between small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and tropical sprue has been proposed to be involved in the etiology of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Intestinal immunologic dysfunction, including deficiencies in secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), may predispose people to malabsorption and bacterial colonization, so tropical sprue may be triggered in susceptible individuals following an acute enteric infection.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of tropical sprue can be complicated because many diseases have similar symptoms. The following investigation results are suggestive:
* Abnormal flattening of villi and inflammation of the lining of the small intestine, observed during an endoscopic procedure.
* Presence of inflammatory cells (most often lymphocytes) in the biopsy of small intestine tissue.
* Low levels of vitamins A, B12, E, D, and K, as well as serum albumin, calcium, and folate, revealed by a blood test.
* Excess fat in the feces (steatorrhoea).
* Thickened small bowel folds seen on imaging.

Tropical sprue is largely limited to within about 30 degrees north and south of the equator. Recent travel to this region is a key factor in diagnosing this disease in residents of countries outside of that geographical region.

Other conditions which can resemble tropical sprue need to be differentiated. Coeliac disease (also known as &quot;coeliac sprue or gluten sensitive enteropathy&quot;), has similar symptoms to tropical sprue, with the flattening of the villi and small intestine inflammation and is caused by an autoimmune disorder in genetically susceptible individuals triggered by ingested gluten. Malabsorption can also be caused by protozoan infections, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, immunodeficiency, chronic pancreatitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Environmental enteropathy is a less severe, subclinical condition similar to tropical sprue.

==Prevention==
Preventive measures for visitors to tropical areas where the condition exists include steps to reduce the likelihood of gastroenteritis. These may comprise using only bottled water for drinking, brushing teeth, and washing food, and avoiding fruits washed with tap water (or consuming only peeled fruits, such as bananas and oranges). Basic sanitation is necessary to reduce fecal-oral contamination and the impact of environmental enteropathy in the developing world.

==Treatment==
Once diagnosed, tropical sprue can be treated by a course of the antibiotic tetracycline or sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (co-trimoxazole) for 3 to 6 months.
Supplementation of vitamins B12 and folic acid improves appetite and leads to a gain in weight.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for tropical sprue may be excellent after treatment. It usually does not recur in people who get it during travel to affected regions. The recurrence rate for natives is about 20%, but another study showed changes can persist for several years.

==Epidemiology==
Tropical sprue is common in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and India and southeast Asia. In the Caribbean, it appeared to be more common in Puerto Rico and Haiti. Epidemics in southern India have occurred.

==History==
The disease was first described by William Hillary in 1759 in Barbados. Tropical sprue was responsible for one-sixth of all casualties sustained by the Allied forces in India and Southeast Asia during World War II. The use of folic acid and vitamin B12 in the treatment of tropical sprue was promoted in the late 1940s by Dr. Tom Spies of the University of Alabama, while conducting his research in Cuba and Puerto Rico.

<doc id="1231465" wikidata="Q8020474" url="?curid=1231465" title="William Winkenwerder Jr.">
<text>William Winkenwerder Jr. is an American business and health care industry executive. He was Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs from 2001 to 2007. He had executive positions within the health industry.

He was CEO of Highmark. He is the chairman and CEO of Winkenwerder Strategies, and chairman of CitiusTech.

==Education==
Winkenwerder graduated from Davidson College with a BS in Pre-Med in 1976 and The University of North Carolina Medical School in 1981. In 1986, he received his Master of Business Administration from The Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania. Winkenwerder is board certified in internal medicine, and a fellow of The American College of Physicians.

==Career==
===Early career===
Winkenwerder worked as a senior executive in the private healthcare industry. He was an early advocate of evidence-based medicine, prevention, and clinical practice guidelines. He was Vice President at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts. AHIP asked him to join their board of directors.

===Department of Defense===
From October 2001 through April 2007, Winkenwerder was Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs in the United States Department of Defense. His senate confirmation was sponsored and presented to the US Senate Armed Services Committee by Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.

Winkenwerder was one of the officials who pursued a military anthrax vaccine immunization program and its potential expansion to include civilians. While in office, Winkenwerder also documented the U.S. military smallpox vaccination program through a study. Winkenwerder also organized a task force that worked on a plan to provide benefits for reserve and National Guard forces, which opened Tricare to non-mobilized reserve servicemen without employment or health insurance.

In 2005, Winkenwerder testified before Congress on the subject of military mental health.

Also in 2005, during his tenure at the Department of Defense, Winkenwerder issued an internal policy statement reiterating the importance of &#x27;humane treatment of detainees&#x27; during interrogations at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. The guidance specified that military medics charged with the medical care of detainees must be guided by medical ethics, make medically appropriate decisions and report inhumane treatment. It was later reported that military intelligence, which did not report to Winkenwerder, allowed some &#x27;non treating&#x27; medical and science personnel to assist in the interrogations. Winkenwerder said that had resulted in a very small number of reports of patient abuse by military medics.

In 2007, he was also testified about conditions and renovations at the Walter Reed Medical Center and the National Naval Medical Center. During his tenure, the Walter Reed Medical Center, the Bethesda Naval Hospital, and several smaller military hospitals were consolidated into the National Naval Medical Center.

Winkenwerder launched AHLTA (Armed-forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application), which was the world’s largest electronic health record system at the time of its implementation, in order to transition the armed forces to using electronic health records.

He stepped down from his post in April 2007, following criticism of the Department of Defense&#x27;s medical records system he had overseen.

Winkenwerder is an honorary chairman of the International Committee of Military Medicine.

=== Later career ===
In 2004, Winkenwerder received the Alumni Achievement Award from his alma mater, the Wharton School of Business, for his work with the Department of Defense. In 2005, he went on to receive the Dr. Nathan Davis Award from the American Medical Association.

In 2007, Winkenwerder was hired as a senior adviser by Deloitte. From 2007 to 2012, Winkenwerder was chairman of The Winkenwerder Company. In 2009, Johns Hopkins Medicine retained The Winkenwerder Company to help develop advanced health care services for government agencies.

From 2012 to 2014, he was CEO of Highmark. During his tenure, Highmark established the Allegheny Health Network after acquiring several hospitals in Western Pennsylvania, including Saint Vincent Hospital. In May 2014, Winkenwerder was removed from the position.

In late 2014, Winkenwerder established the private equity firm Winkenwerder Strategies.

He also sits on the board of directors of The Bob Woodruff Foundation. He is also a board member at Confluent Health, Accreon, and Cureatr, where he was vice chairman of the board. Since 2015, Winkenwerder has been a board director of CitiusTech Inc, becoming its chairman in 2017. He was an advisor to candidates in the US national elections of 2008 and 2012.

== Publications ==
Winkenwerder has published articles, interviews, and editorials in Health Affairs, New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and USA Today. He has contributed to national news and media outlets including CNN, ABC, and Fox News.

== Recognition ==

<doc id="1231474" wikidata="Q8013450" url="?curid=1231474" title="William James Erasmus Wilson">
<text>Sir William James Erasmus Wilson FRCS FRS (25 November 18097 August 1884), generally known as Sir Erasmus Wilson, was an English surgeon and dermatologist.

==Biography==

Wilson was born in London, studied at Dartford Grammar School before St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in London, and at the University of Aberdeen, and early in life became known as a skilful surgeon and dissector.

It was his sympathy with the poor of London and a suggestion from Mr. Thomas Wakley of &quot;The Lancet&quot;, of which he acted for a time as sub-editor, which first led him to take up skin diseases as a special study. The cases of scrofula, anaemia, and blood-poisoning which he saw made him set to work to alleviate the suffering of persons so afflicted, and he quickly established a reputation for treating this class of patients. It was said that he treated the rich by ordering them to give up luxuries; the poor by prescribing for them proper nourishment, which was often provided out of his own pocket. In the opinion of one of his biographers, we owe to Wilson in great measure the habit of the daily bath, and he helped very much to bring the Victorian Turkish bath into use in Great Britain, and in the process writing a number of works on spas, baths and thermo-therapy, all of which overlap in their content.

Indeed, his works on spas, baths, and thermo-therapy were directly related to his work on the health of skin. His earliest such works on this topic outlined the relationship between various applications of water, vapour baths, the action of heat and cold through such media on the action of the skin, and the relationship between this and health in general. Moreover, his works had a direct impact on the hydrotherapy movement of the time (then known as hydropathy), and the overlapping sanitary reform movement. He applauded the establishment of Public Baths and Wash-houses, as &quot;amongst the noblest of the institutions…as they are one of the greatest discoveries of the present age&quot;, and dedicated his 1854 book &quot;Healthy Skin&quot; to another sanitary reform proponent, Edwin Chadwick &quot;In admiration of his strenuous and indefatigable labors in the cause of Sanitary Reform&quot;.

Nor was Wilson shy of saying what needed to be said in the promotion of sanitary reform. In Metcalfe&#x27;s (1877) work on sanitary reform and all the above-mentioned overlaps, he describes the Chinese vapour baths. After describing the bathing establishments as a whole, he describes the bathing room itself, &quot;which is about thirty feet by twenty, and is filled with hot steam or vapour&quot;:
The entire floor, except a narrow space round the sides, is occupied by a hot-water bath from one to eighteen inches deep. The furnace is outside, and the flues are carried under the centre of the bath. In the hazy light of this room may be seen the perspiring Chinamen disperting themselves in the shallow water, until, when cleansed to their satisfaction, they return to the cooling room, there to regale themselves with cups of tea and pipes of tobacco. All classes of Chinese frequent these bathing establishments. Mr Ellis, in his &quot;Journal of the Embassy to China (1816),&quot; says of this Chinese cleansing apparatus, that it is &quot;disgusting,&quot; but says Mr Erasmus Wilson, &quot;What would Mr Ellis say of a country in which there existed no cleansing apparatus whatever? For example, his own.
Wilson wrote much upon the diseases which specially occupied his attention, and his books, &quot;A Healthy Skin&quot; and &quot;Student&#x27;s Book of Diseases of the Skin&quot;, though they were not received without criticism at the time of their appearance, long remained text-books of their subject. He visited the East to study leprosy, Switzerland to investigate the causes of goitre, and Italy with the purpose of adding to his knowledge of the skin diseases affecting an ill-nourished peasantry.

He was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1881, and died at Westgate-on-Sea, Kent in 1884. He had married Charlotte Mary Doherty in 1841; they had no children. After the death of his wife, the bulk of his property, some £200,000, went to the Royal College of Surgeons.

==Philanthropic works==

He made a large fortune by his successful practice and by skilful investments, and since he had no family he devoted a great deal of his money to charitable and educational purposes. In 1869 he founded the chair and museum of dermatology in the Royal College of Surgeons, of which he was chosen president in 1881, and which just before his death awarded him its honorary gold medal, which had been founded in 1800 and only awarded on six previous occasions. He also founded a professorship of pathology at the University of Aberdeen and paid for the vast medical library at the Hunterian Museum, London where his bust takes pride of place at the end of the library.

In 1878 he earned the thanks of the nation on different grounds, by defraying the expense of bringing the Egyptian obelisk called Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle from Alexandria to London, where it was erected on the Thames Embankment. The British Government had not thought it worth the expense of transportation. This is now one of London&#x27;s best known landmarks. Erasmus Wilson was also closely associated with the Royal Medical Benevolent College in Epsom, Surrey, now Epsom College. One of the boarding houses &#x27;Wilson House&#x27; established in 1873 is named after him and carries his name on the foundation stone located to the north east corner of the building, right of the entrance.

==Famous statements==
1878: &quot;When the Paris Exhibition closes, electric light will close with it and no more be heard of.&quot;

Note: Internet Archives lists more copies of some of these titles. Not all were checked. Some may be duplicates, and some may be later editions. The sample above shows that some titles had multiple subsequent editions. Also for books prior to 1881, Wilson did not have the title Sir, as he had not yet been knighted.

<text>Beagle Bros was an American software company that specialized in creating personal computing products. Their primary focus was on the Apple II family of computers. Although they ceased business in 1991, owner Mark Simonsen permitted the Beagle Bros name and logo to be included on the 30th anniversary reboot of I. O. Silver, released on December 12, 2014, by former Beagle programmer Randy Brandt.

==History==
Beagle Bros was founded in 1980 by Bert Kersey and expanded over the years to include a wide variety of staff members, programmers, and designers. Whereas most software companies focused on professional users and business systems, Kersey founded the company with the intention of capitalizing on the &quot;hobbyist&quot; market that had formed when affordable personal computers became more readily available. &quot;Apple Mechanic&quot; allowed users to create their own shape tables (an early form of sprites) to create their own games, &quot;DOS Boss&quot; let users patch the disk operating system, and &quot;Beagle Bag&quot; had a number of games written in BASIC that people could utilize. Beagle Bros&#x27; catalog and print advertisements featured many playful programming tips about the Apple II system, many in the form of short Applesoft BASIC programs that took advantage of undocumented or unexpected behavior. Beagle Bros used woodcut and other 19th century artwork in its printed designs.

When the Apple IIGS was released, Beagle Bros was among the first companies to release content for the platform. Both &quot;Platinum Paint&quot; and &quot;BeagleWrite GS&quot; (acquired and repackaged) are still regarded as being among the high points of commercial IIGS software.

Beagle Bros began producing add-ons for the AppleWorks, its first being the MacroWorks keyboard shortcut utility by Randy Brandt. Beagle Bros programmer Alan Bird later devised an API for creating AppleWorks add-ons, which they dubbed TimeOut. TimeOut programmers Alan Bird, Randy Brandt and Rob Renstrom were tapped by Claris to develop AppleWorks 3.0, and the TimeOut API itself became a part of AppleWorks with version 4.0. Eventually the TimeOut API was made public and a number of non-Beagle TimeOut applications were released.

In 1991, Mark Simonsen licensed the Beagle Bros Apple II line to Quality Computers. Quality Computers subsequently went through several acquisitions and no longer exists. Multiple Beagle Bros products were released as freeware in the mid-1990s, including most of the company&#x27;s early utilities and games. Today, their programs are available on the Internet.

BeagleWorks, the company&#x27;s main Macintosh product, was licensed to WordPerfect Corporation in 1992, where it became WordPerfect Works. This product was later discontinued after WordPerfect was acquired by Novell. The company also produced a few small Macintosh and PC utilities.

Many former employees have continued to be involved in the software industry, such as Joe Holt who co-authored iMovie, and Alan Bird who worked on Eudora and the OneClick shortcut utility for Macintosh. Randy Brandt created Online Army Knife, an award-winning Macintosh spell checker, and continued publishing AppleWorks products through his JEM Software spin-off. Mark Munz created Deja ][, which allows AppleWorks to run under Mac OS X. The company&#x27;s founder, Bert Kersey, started a model train company after selling Beagle Bros, and is now retired.

<text>Mapledurham Lock is a lock and weir situated on the River Thames in England, about 4 miles upstream of Reading. The lock was first built in 1777 by the Thames Navigation Commissioners and the present lock dates from 1908.

Despite its name, the lock is located in the Berkshire village and civil parish of Purley-On-Thames on the south bank of the river, rather than in the Oxfordshire village of Mapledurham on the other side of the river. The lock is accessible from Purley village down Mapledurham Drive, a metalled lane that turns to gravel. The weir stretches across the river, in both counties.

The weir runs from the lock island in a long curve across the river between the two villages. However no access is possible across the weir, and without a boat, journeys between the two villages require a lengthy detour via Reading or Pangbourne. The weir still provides a head of water to drive Mapledurham Watermill which is on the opposite side of the river. The weir is also the furthest upstream on the Thames that has a salmon ladder.

==History==
Mapledurham mill dates back to Domesday Book, and the weir was probably connected to it then, although the earliest extant reference to the weir is from the time of Edward I. The mill was attached to the property of Mapledurham House, owned by the Blount family, who have always had an interest in the weir. There was a flash lock at the weir but passage through this was stopped at the opening of the pound lock in 1777. The lock was built of fir on the Purley side of the river and was to be called Purley Lock. However local custom retained the old name. A cottage was ordered for the lock-keeper in 1816. During the 19th century there were disputes between the lock-keeper William Sheppard and the Blount family. However despite Blount&#x27;s representations to the Conservators, Sheppard remained in post for 54 years, retiring at the age of 79. A new and greatly enlarged lock was built beside the old one in 1908.

Mapledurham Mill is still functioning across the river from the lock, making this the only lock and weir combination on the Thames that supports the two functions that were originally the norm on river navigations. As both mill and navigation are now principally tourist enterprises, this no longer leads to the sort of conflicts between milling and navigation interests that were once common on the river.

==Reach above the lock==
The river is in open country nearly all the way to Pangbourne and has been described by Robert Gibbings writing in 1939 (&quot;Sweet Thames Run Softly&quot;) as so crowded with views &quot;they might have dropped from the gold frames of the Royal Academy&quot;.

After Mapledurham, Hardwick House is visible on the northern side of the river. Pangbourne Meadows, owned by the National Trust, lie to the south of the river before Whitchurch Bridge. This toll bridge crosses the river between Pangbourne and Whitchurch. Between the bridge and Whitchurch Lock, the River Pang joins the Thames from the south.

The Thames Path follows the southern bank to Whitchurch Bridge, where it crosses the river. (Although this is a toll bridge, pedestrians are no longer charged).

The artist E. H. Shepherd who illustrated The Wind in the Willows made many drawings in this area, and Toad Hall is said to be based on either Mapledurham House or Hardwick House, home of Charles Day Rose, nearby.
