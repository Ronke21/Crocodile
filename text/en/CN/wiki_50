<text>Yulia Volodymyrivna Tymoshenko ( Hrihyan born 27 November 1960) is a Ukrainian politician, who served as Prime Minister of Ukraine in 2005, and again from 2007 until 2010; the first and only woman in Ukraine to hold that position. She has been a member of the Verkhovna Rada as People&#x27;s Deputy of Ukraine several times between 1997 and 2007, and presently as of 2014, and was First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine for the fuel and energy complex from 1999 to 2001. She is a Candidate of Economic Sciences.

Tymoshenko is the leader of the Batkivshchyna () political party. She supports Ukraine&#x27;s integration into the European Union and strongly opposes the membership of Ukraine in the Russia-led Eurasian Customs Union. She supports NATO membership for Ukraine.

She co-led the Orange Revolution and was the first woman twice appointed and endorsed by parliamentary majority to become prime minister, serving from 24 January to 8 September 2005, and again from 18 December 2007 to 4 March 2010. She placed third in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s most powerful women in 2005.

Tymoshenko finished second in the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election runoff, losing by 3.5 percentage points to the winner, Viktor Yanukovych. From 2011 to 2014 she was detained due to a criminal case that was seen by many as politically motivated persecution by President Viktor Yanukovych, but after the Revolution of Dignity she was rehabilitated by the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the European Court of Human Rights. In the concluding days of the Revolution of Dignity, she was released after three years in jail. She again finished second in the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election, this time to Petro Poroshenko. After being a heavy favorite in the polls for several years, she came third in the first round of the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election, receiving 13.40% of the vote, thus failing to qualify for the second round.

Elected to Ukraine&#x27;s parliament in 2019, she led her party in opposition.

==Early life and career==
Tymoshenko was born Yulia Hrihyan on 27 November 1960, in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. Her mother, Lyudmila Telehina (&quot;née&quot; Nelepova), was born on 11 August 1937, also in Dnipropetrovsk. Yulia&#x27;s father, Volodymyr Hrihyan, who according to his Soviet Union passport was Latvian, was born on 3 December 1937, also in Dnipropetrovsk. He abandoned his wife and young daughter when Yulia was between one and three years old; Yulia used her mother&#x27;s surname.

Yulia&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Abram Kapitelman (), was born in 1914. After graduating from Dnipropetrovsk State University in 1940, Kapitelman was sent to work in Western Ukraine, where he worked &quot;one academic quarter&quot; as the director of a public Jewish school in the city Sniatyn. Kapitelman was mobilized into the army in the autumn of 1940 and subsequently was killed while taking part in the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945) on 8 November 1944, with the rank of &quot;lieutenant&quot; in Signal corps.

===Education===
In 1977, Tymoshenko graduated from high school No. 75 in Dnipropetrovsk. Tymoshenko constantly helps the school. In 1978, Tymoshenko was enrolled in the Automatization and Telemechanics Department of the Dnipropetrovsk Mining Institute. In 1979, she transferred to the Economics Department of the Dnipropetrovsk State University, majoring in cybernetic engineering and graduating in 1984 with first degree honors as an engineer-economist.

In 1999, she defended her PhD dissertation, titled &quot;State Regulation of the tax system&quot;, at the Kyiv National Economic University and received a Ph.D. in economics.

===Commercial career===
Tymoshenko has worked as a practicing economist and academic. Prior to her political career, she became a successful but controversial businesswoman in the gas industry, becoming by some estimates one of the richest people in the country. Before becoming Ukraine&#x27;s first female prime minister in 2005, Tymoshenko co-led the Orange Revolution. She was placed third in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s List of The World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women 2005.

After graduating from the Dnipropetrovsk State University in 1984, Tymoshenko worked as an engineer-economist in the &quot;Dnipro Machine-Building Plant&quot; (which produced missiles) in Dnipropetrovsk until 1988.

In 1988, as part of the &quot;perestroika&quot; initiatives, Yulia and Oleksandr Tymoshenko borrowed 5,000 roubles and opened a video-rental cooperative, perhaps with the help of Oleksander&#x27;s father, Gennadi Tymoshenko, who presided over a regional film-distribution network in the provincial council.

From 1989 to 1991, Yulia and Oleksandr Tymoshenko founded and led a commercial video-rental company &quot;Terminal&quot; in Dnipropetrovsk,

In 1991, Tymoshenko established (jointly with her husband Oleksandr, Gennadi Tymoshenko, and Olexandr Gravets) &quot;The Ukrainian Petrol Corporation&quot;, a company that supplied the agriculture industry of Dnipropetrovsk with fuel from 1991 to 1995. Tymoshenko worked as a general director. In 1995, this company was reorganized into United Energy Systems of Ukraine. Tymoshenko served as the president of United Energy Systems of Ukraine, a privately owned middleman company that became the main importer of Russian natural gas to Ukraine, from 1995 to 1 January 1997. During that time she was nicknamed the &quot;gas princess&quot;. She was also accused of &quot;having given Pavlo Lazarenko kickbacks in exchange for her company&#x27;s stranglehold on the country&#x27;s gas supplies&quot;, although Judge Martin Jenkins of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on 7 May 2004, dismissed the allegations of money laundering and conspiracy regarding UESU, Somoli Ent. et al. (companies affiliated with Yulia Tymoshenko) in connection with Lazarenko&#x27;s activities. During this period, Tymoshenko was involved in business relations (either co-operative or hostile) with many important figures of Ukraine. Tymoshenko also had to deal with the management of the Russian corporation, Gazprom. Tymoshenko claims that, under her management, UESU successfully solved significant economic problems: from 1995 to 1997, Ukraine&#x27;s multi-billion debt for Russian natural gas was paid; Ukraine resumed international cooperation in machine building, the pipe industry and construction; and Ukraine&#x27;s export of goods to Russia doubled. In the period of 1995 to 1997, Tymoshenko was considered one of the richest business people in Ukraine. When Tymoshenko made her initial foray into national politics, her company became an instrument of political pressure on her and on her family. UESU top management faced prosecution. Since 1998, Tymoshenko has been a prominent politician in Ukraine. She was not included in the list of &quot;100 richest Ukrainians&quot; in 2006.

==Political career==

===Early career===
Tymoshenko entered politics in 1996, when she was elected to the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) in constituency No. 229, Bobrynets, Kirovohrad Oblast, winning a record 92.3% of the vote. In Parliament, Tymoshenko joined the &quot;Constitutional Centre&quot; faction. In February 1997 this centrists faction was 56 lawmakers strong and, according to Ukrainska Pravda, at first it supported the policies of Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma. In late 1997, Tymoshenko called for impeachment and the next Ukrainian Presidential elections to be held not in 1999, but in the fall of 1998. In late November 1997, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine asked the Verkhovna Rada to lift Tymoshenko&#x27;s parliamentary immunity, but the deputies voted against it.

Tymoshenko was re-elected in 1998, winning a constituency in the Kirovohrad Oblast, and was also number six on the party list of Hromada. She became an influential person in the parliament, and was appointed the Chair of the Budget Committee of the Verkhovna Rada. After Hromada&#x27;s party leader Pavlo Lazarenko fled to the United States in February 1999 to avoid investigations for embezzlement, various faction members left Hromada to join other parliamentary factions, among them Tymoshenko, who set up the All-Ukrainian Union &quot;Fatherland&quot; faction in March 1999 in protest against the methods of Lazarenko. &quot;Fatherland&quot; was officially registered as a political party in September 1999, and began to attract the voters who had voted for Yevhen Marchuk in the October 1999 presidential election. In 2000, &quot;Fatherland&quot; went in opposition to President Kuchma.

====Deputy Prime Minister for fuel and energy====

From late December 1999 to January 2001, Tymoshenko was the Deputy Prime Minister for the fuel and energy sector in the cabinet of Viktor Yushchenko. She officially left parliament on 2 March 2000. Under her guidance, Ukraine&#x27;s revenue collections from the electricity industry grew by several thousand percent. She scrapped the practice of barter in the electricity market, requiring industrial customers to pay for their electricity in cash. She also terminated exemptions for many organizations which excluded them from having their power disconnected. Her reforms meant that the government had sufficient funds to pay civil servants and increase salaries.
In 2000, Tymoshenko&#x27;s government provided an additional 18 billion hryvna for social payments. Half of this amount was collected due to withdrawal of funds from shadow schemes, the ban on barter payments and the introduction of competition rules to the energy market.

On 18 August 2000, her husband Oleksandr Tymoshenko, CEO of United Energy Systems of Ukraine (UESU), was detained and arrested. Tymoshenko herself stated that her husband&#x27;s arrest was the result of political pressure on her. On 19 January 2001, Kuchma ordered Tymoshenko to be dismissed. Then, Yushchenko silently accepted her dismissal, despite her achievements in the energy sector. Ukrainian media called it &quot;the first betrayal of Viktor Yushchenko&quot;. Soon after her dismissal, Tymoshenko took leadership of the National Salvation Committee and became active in the &quot;Ukraine without Kuchma&quot; protests. The movement embraced a number of opposition parties, such as Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, &quot;Fatherland&quot;, Ukrainian Republican Party, Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party, &quot;Sobor&quot;, Ukrainian Social-Democratic Party, Ukrainian Christian-Democratic Party and Patriotic Party.

===Campaigns against Kuchma and 2002 election===
On 9 February 2001, Tymoshenko founded the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc (the National Salvation Committee merged into it), a political bloc that received 7.2% of the vote in the 2002 parliamentary election. She has been head of the Batkivshchina (Fatherland) political party since the party was organised in 1999.

On 13 February 2001, Tymoshenko was arrested and charged with forging customs documents and smuggling gas in 1997 (while president of UESU). Her political supporters organized numerous protest rallies near the Lukyanivska Prison where she was held in custody.

In a letter to the editor of the British newspaper &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Tymoshenko claimed that Kuchma was consciously building a totalitarian system in the country:

In March 2001, Pechersk District Court (Kyiv) found the charges groundless and cancelled the arrest sanction. According to Tymoshenko, the charges were fabricated by Kuchma&#x27;s regime at the behest of oligarchs threatened by her efforts to eradicate corruption and institute market-based reforms. On 9 April 2003, the Kyiv Court of Appeal issued a ruling that invalidated and cancelled proceedings on the criminal cases against Yulia and Oleksandr Tymoshenko. Despite Tymoshenko being cleared of the charges, Moscow maintained an arrest warrant for her should she enter Russia. In 2005, all charges were declared groundless and lifted.

The criminal case was closed in Ukraine in January 2005 due to lack of evidence, and in Russia in December 2005 by reason of lapse of time. On 18 November 2005, the Supreme Court of Ukraine issued a ruling which invalidated all criminal cases against Tymoshenko and her family. Despite this, the case was reopened in Ukraine since May 2010, after Yanukovych came to power.

Tymoshenko&#x27;s husband, Oleksandr, spent two years (2002–2004) in hiding in order to avoid incarceration on charges the couple said were unfounded and politically motivated by the former Kuchma administration.

On 30 December 2010, the US State Department informed the Ukrainian government of its concern, and indicated that &quot;the prosecution of Tymoshenko should not be selective or politically motivated.

Once the charges were dropped, Tymoshenko reassumed her place among the leaders of the grassroots campaign against Kuchma for his alleged role in the murder of the journalist Georgiy Gongadze. In this campaign, Tymoshenko first became known as a passionate, revolutionist leader, an example of this being a TV broadcast of her smashing prison windows during one of the rallies. At the time, Tymoshenko wanted to organise a national referendum to impeach Kuchma.
On 11 August 2001, civilian and military prosecutors in Russia opened a new criminal case against Tymoshenko accusing her of bribery. On 27 December 2005, Russian prosecutors dropped these charges. Russian prosecutors had suspended an arrest warrant when she was appointed prime minister, but reinstated it after she was fired in September 2005. The prosecutors suspended it again when she came to Moscow for questioning on 25 September 2005. Tymoshenko didn&#x27;t travel to Russia during her first seven months as prime minister (the first Tymoshenko Government).

In January 2002, Tymoshenko was involved in a car accident that she survived with minor injuries.

===Role in the Orange Revolution===

In late 2001, both Tymoshenko and Yushchenko attempted to create a broad opposition bloc against Kuchma, in order to win the Ukrainian presidential election of 2004.

In late 2002, Tymoshenko, Oleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party of Ukraine), Petro Symonenko (Communist Party of Ukraine) and Yushchenko (Our Ukraine) issued a joint statement concerning &quot;the beginning of a state revolution in Ukraine&quot;. In the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election, the communist party stepped out of the alliance, but the other parties remained allied and Symonenko was against a single candidate from the alliance (until July 2006).

In March 2004, Tymoshenko announced that leaders of &quot;Our Ukraine&quot;, BYuT and Socialist Party of Ukraine were working on a coalition agreement concerning joint participation in the presidential campaign. Tymoshenko decided not to run for president and give way to Yushchenko. On 2 July 2004, Our Ukraine and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc established the &quot;Force of the people&quot;, a coalition which aimed to stop &quot;the destructive process that has, as a result of the incumbent authorities, become a characteristic for Ukraine.&quot; The pact included a promise by Yushchenko to nominate Tymoshenko as prime minister if Yushchenko should win the October 2004 presidential election. Tymoshenko was actively campaigning for Yushchenko, touring and taking part in rallies all over Ukraine. After Yushchenko had dropped out of the campaign due to his mysterious poisoning, Tymoshenko continued campaigning on his behalf.

After the initial vote on 31 October, two candidates – Yanukovych and Yushchenko – proceeded to a runoff. As Tymoshenko earlier envisaged, Yushchenko received endorsement from former competitors who didn&#x27;t make it to the runoff, such as Oleksandr Moroz (Socialist Party), Anatoliy Kinakh (Party of Industrials and Entrepreneurs), former Kyiv city mayor Oleksanrd Omelchenko and others.

On 6 November 2004, Tymoshenko asked people to spread the orange symbols (orange was the color of Yushchenko&#x27;s campaign). &quot;Grab a piece of the cheapest orange cloth, make ribbons and put them everywhere&quot; she said. &quot;Don&#x27;t wait until the campaign managers give those to you&quot;.

When allegations of fraud began to spread, the &quot;orange team&quot; decided to conduct a parallel vote tabulation during 21 November 2004 runoff and announce the results immediately to people on Independence Square (Maidan Nezalezhnosti) in Kyiv. Tymoshenko called Kyiv residents to gather on the square and asked people from other cities and towns to come and stand for their choice. &quot;Bring warm clothes, lard and bread, garlic and onions and come to Kyiv&quot; she said. On 22 November 2004, massive protests broke out in cities across Ukraine: The largest, in Kyiv&#x27;s Maidan Nezalezhnosti, attracted an estimated 500,000 participants. These protests became known as the Orange Revolution. On 23 November 2004, Tymoshenko led the participants of the protest to the President&#x27;s Administration. On Bankova Street, special riot police prevented the procession from going any further, so people lifted Tymoshenko up and she walked on the police&#x27;s shields to the Administration building.

On 3 December 2004, the Supreme Court of Ukraine invalidated the results of the runoff and scheduled the re-run for 26 December 2004. After the cancellation of Yanukovych&#x27;s official victory and the second round of the election, Yushchenko was elected president with 51.99% of votes (Yanukovych received 44.2% support).

During the protests, Tymoshenko&#x27;s speeches on the &quot;Maidan&quot; kept the momentum of the street protests going. Her popularity grew significantly to the point where the media began to refer to her as the Ukrainian or Slavic &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; as well as &quot;Queen of the Orange revolution&quot; in addition to her pre existing sobriquet from the 1990s decade as the &quot;Gas Princess&quot;. Additional nicknames included &quot;Goddess of the Revolution&quot; and the &quot;Princess Leia of Ukrainian politics&quot;.

===First term as prime minister (February – September 2005)===
On 24 January 2005, Tymoshenko was appointed acting prime minister of Ukraine under Yushchenko&#x27;s presidency. On 4 February, Tymoshenko&#x27;s premiership appointment was ratified by the parliament with an overwhelming majority of 373 votes (226 were required for approval). She is the first woman appointed Prime Minister of Ukraine.

The Tymoshenko cabinet did not have any other members of party Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc besides Tymoshenko herself and Oleksandr Turchynov, who was appointed the chief of Security Service of Ukraine. The ministers who were working with her took her side in the later confrontation with Viktor Yushchenko.

On 28 July 2005, &quot;Forbes&quot; named Tymoshenko the third most powerful woman in the world, behind only Condoleezza Rice and Wu Yi. However, in the magazine&#x27;s list published on 1 September 2006, Tymoshenko&#x27;s name was not among the top 100.

In September 2005, Tymoshenko received the &quot;Person of the Year of Central and Eastern Europe&quot; award according to the 15th International Economic Forum in Krinitsa Gurska.

Several months into her government, internal conflicts within the post‐Revolution coalition began to damage Tymoshenko&#x27;s administration. On 24 August 2005, Viktor Yushchenko gave an Independence Day speech during which he called Tymoshenko&#x27;s government &quot;the best&quot;.

Yet on 8 September, after the resignation of several senior officials, including the Head of the Security and Defense Council Petro Poroshenko and Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Tomenko, Tymoshenko&#x27;s government was dismissed by Yushchenko during a live television address to the nation. Yushchenko went on to criticize her work as head of the Cabinet, suggesting it had led to an economic slowdown and political conflicts within the ruling coalition. He said that Tymoshenko was serving interests of some businesses, and the government decision to re-privatize the Nikopol Ferroalloy Plant (previously owned by Kuchma&#x27;s son in law Viktor Pinchuk) &quot;was the last drop&quot; that made him dismiss the government. On 13 September 2005, Yushchenko accused Tymoshenko of betrayal of &quot;Orange Revolution&quot; ideas. In his interview for the Associated Press, he said that during the time of her presidency at UESU, Tymoshenko accumulated an 8 million Hryvna debt, and that she had used her authority as prime minister to write off that debt. Tymoshenko has repeatedly stated that the mentioned amount was not a debt, but fines imposed by the Tax Inspection from 1997 to 1998, and that all the cases regarding UESU had been closed before she became prime minister.

Tymoshenko blamed Yushchenko&#x27;s closest circle for scheming against her and undermining the activities of her Cabinet. She also criticised Yushchenko, telling the BBC that he had &quot;practically ruined our unity, our future, the future of the country&quot;, without rooting out corruption as he pledged to do and that the president&#x27;s action was absolutely illogical.

At the time, Tymoshenko saw a rapid growth of approval ratings, while Yushchenko&#x27;s approval ratings went down. This tendency was later proved by the results of parliamentary elections in 2006, when for the first time ever BYuT outran &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; party, winning 129 seats vs. 81, respectively. During the previous parliamentary elections of 2002, BYuT had only 22 members of parliament, while &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; had 112.

The work of Tymoshenko as prime minister in 2005 was complicated due to internal conflicts in the &quot;orange&quot; team. According to Tymoshenko, Yushchenko and Poroshenko were trying to turn the National Security and Defense Council into the &quot;second Cabinet of Ministers&quot;.

Tymoshenko was succeeded as prime minister by Yuriy Yehanurov.

===Opposition and 2006 parliamentary election===

Soon after Tymoshenko&#x27;s discharge in September 2005, the General Prosecutor Office of the Russian Federation dismissed all charges against her. On 18 November 2005, the Supreme Court of Ukraine issued a ruling which invalidated all criminal cases against Tymoshenko and her family.

After her dismissal, Tymoshenko started to tour the country in a bid to win the 2006 Ukrainian parliamentary election as the leader of her Bloc. Tymoshenko soon announced that she wanted to return to the post of prime minister. She managed to form a strong team that started a political fight on two fronts – with Yanukovych&#x27;s and Yushchenko&#x27;s camps.

With the Bloc coming second in the election, and winning 129 seats, many speculated that she might form a coalition with Yushchenko&#x27;s &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; party and the Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) to prevent the Party of Regions from gaining power. Tymoshenko again reiterated her stance in regard to becoming prime minister. However, negotiations with &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; and SPU faced many difficulties as the various blocs fought over posts and engaged in counter-negotiations with other groups.

On 21 June 2006, the Ukrainian media reported that the parties had finally reached a coalition agreement, which appeared to have ended nearly three months of political uncertainty.

Tymoshenko&#x27;s nomination and confirmation as the new prime minister was expected to be straightforward. However, the political intrigue that took place broke the plan. BYuT partners &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; and Socialist Party of Ukraine (SPU) could not come to agreement regarding distribution of powers, thus creation of the Coalition of Democratic Forces was put on hold. Yushchenko and oligarchs from his narrow circle were trying to impede Tymoshenko from returning to the office of prime minister. Her nomination was preconditioned on the election of her long-time rival Poroshenko from &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; to the position of speaker of the parliament. Moroz, the chairman of the Socialist Party of Ukraine, also expressed his interest in becoming speaker. Tymoshenko stated that she would vote for any speaker from the coalition. Within a few days of the signing of the coalition agreement, it became clear that the coalition members mistrusted each other, since they considered it a deviation from parliamentary procedures to hold a simultaneous vote on Poroshenko as the speaker and Tymoshenko as prime minister.

The Party of Regions announced an ultimatum to the coalition demanding that parliamentary procedures be observed, asking that membership in parliamentary committees be allocated in proportion to seats held by each fraction, and demanding chairmanship in certain Parliamentary committees as well as Governorships in the administrative subdivisions won by the Party of Regions. The Party of Regions complained that the coalition agreement deprived the Party of Regions and the communists of any representation in the executive and leadership in parliamentary committees, while in the local regional councils won by the Party of Regions the coalition parties were locked out of all committees as well.

Members from the Party of Regions blocked the parliament from 29 June through 6 July.

After lengthy negotiations, SPU suddenly pulled out of the Coalition and joined the alliance with the Party of Regions and the Communist Party of Ukraine. Moroz assured that the team of Yushchenko was conducting secret negotiations with the Party of Regions. According to that deal, Yanukovych was supposed to become the speaker, while Yuriy Yekhanurov kept the prime minister portfolio. These negotiations were conducted by Yekhanurov himself upon Yushchenko&#x27;s request. Later, Yekhanurov admitted this fact in his interview with the &quot;Ukrainska Pravda&quot; website.

Following the surprise nomination of Moroz as the Rada speaker and his subsequent election late on 6 July with the support of the Party of Regions, the &quot;Orange coalition&quot; collapsed. (Poroshenko had withdrawn his candidacy and had urged Moroz to do the same on 7 July). After the creation of a large coalition of majority composed of the Party of Regions, the Socialist Party of Ukraine and the Communist Party of Ukraine, Yanukovych became prime minister, and the other two parties were left in the wilderness. On 3 August 2006, Tymoshenko refused to sign the &quot;Universal of National Unity&quot; declaration initiated by Yushchenko. The document, signed by Yushchenko, Yanukovych and leaders of Socialist and Communist parties, sealed Yanukovych&#x27;s appointment as prime minister. Tymoshenko called it &quot;the act of betrayal&quot;. In September 2006, Tymoshenko announced that her political force would be in opposition to the new government. Our Ukraine stalled until 4 October 2006, when it too joined the opposition.
On 12 January 2007, a BYuT vote in the parliament overrode the president&#x27;s veto of the &quot;On the Cabinet of Ministers&quot; law that was advantageous for the president. (In exchange, BYuT voted for the &quot;On Imperative Mandate&quot; and &quot;On Opposition&quot; laws). This vote was one of many steps undertaken by BYuT to ruin a fragile alliance between president Yushchenko and prime minister Yanukovych.

In March 2007, Tymoshenko traveled to the United States, where she held high-level meetings with Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Stephen Hadley, the National Security Advisor under President George W. Bush. On 31 March 2007, Tymoshenko initiated a &quot;100 thousand people Maidan&quot; aimed to urge the president to call an early parliamentary election.

On 4 April 2007, Yushchenko issued an edict &quot;On early termination of duties of the Verkhovna Rada&quot; as a reaction to violation of the Constitution by the Party of Regions, which had started dragging individual deputies into the &quot;ruling coalition&quot; (this being illegal, as coalitions should be formed by factions and not by individual deputies). In doing so, the Party of Regions was trying to achieve a constitutional majority of 300 votes which would enable Yanukovych to override the president&#x27;s veto and control the legislative process. Party of Regions didn&#x27;t obey this edict. In order to dismiss the Verkhovna Rada, Tymoshenko and her supporters in the parliament (168 deputies from BYuT and &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; factions) quit their parliamentary factions on 2 June 2007. That step invalidated the convocation of the Verkhovna Rada and cleared the path to an early election.

An early parliamentary election was held on 30 September 2007.

===2007 parliamentary election===

Following balloting in the 2007 parliamentary elections held on 30 September 2007, Orange Revolution parties had won majority of 229 votes of BYUT fraction (30,71% of the votes (156 seats) and the Our Ukraine/People&#x27;s Self-defence faction. On 3 October 2007, an almost final tally gave the alliance of Tymoshenko and Yushchenko a slim lead over the rival party of Prime Minister Yanukovych, thanks in part to a vigorous BYuT campaign in the industrial east, a Party of Regions stronghold. Although Yanukovych, whose party won the single biggest share of the vote, also claimed victory, one of his coalition allies, the Socialist Party of Ukraine, failed to gain enough votes to retain seats in Parliament.

On 15 October 2007, the Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc agreed to form a majority coalition in the new parliament of the 6th convocation. On 29 November, a coalition was signed between the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc and Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc, which was associated with President Yushchenko. Both parties are affiliated with the Orange Revolution. On 11 December 2007, the Coalition failed in its attempt to appoint Tymoshenko prime minister, falling one vote short (225 members of parliament supported her nomination). On 12 December 2007, the media reported on the possible attempted assassination of Tymoshenko. BYuT and Tymoshenko herself said it was an intimidation. On 18 December, Tymoshenko was once again elected as prime minister (supported by 226 deputies, the minimal number needed for passage), heading the second Tymoshenko Government.

===Second term as prime minister 2007–2010, and 2008 political crisis===

On 11 July 2008, the Party of Regions tried to vote no-confidence to Tymoshenko&#x27;s government in the parliament, but could not collect enough votes.

The coalition of Tymoshenko&#x27;s Bloc (BYuT) and Yushchenko&#x27;s Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc (OU-PSD) was put at risk due to deliberate misinterpretation of Tymoshenko&#x27;s opinion on the ongoing 2008 South Ossetia War between Georgia and Russia. Yushchenko&#x27;s office accused her of taking a softer position in order to gain support from Russia in the upcoming 2010 election. Andriy Kyslynskyi, the president&#x27;s deputy chief of staff, went as far as to accuse her of &#x27;high treason&#x27;.
According to Ukrainska Pravda and Newswire.ca Tymoshenko expressed her solidarity with Georgia on 13 and 14 August, and later preferred to stay neutral on the issue as according to Constitution President Yuschenko headed foreign policy issues.

According to BYuT, Viktor Baloha (Chief of Staff of the Presidential Secretariat) criticized the premier at every turn, doing the dirty job for the President and accusing her of everything from not being religious enough to damaging the economy and plotting to kill him, and the accusation of &#x27;betrayal&#x27; over Georgia was simply one of the latest and most pernicious attacks directed at the premier. 

After Tymoshenko&#x27;s BYuT voted alongside the Communist Party of Ukraine and the Party of Regions to pass legislation that would facilitate the procedure of impeachment for future presidents and limit the president&#x27;s power while increasing the prime minister&#x27;s powers, President Yushchenko&#x27;s OU-PSD bloc pulled out of the coalition and Yushchenko promised to veto the legislation and threatened to hold an election if a new coalition was not formed soon. This resulted in the 2008 Ukrainian political crisis, which culminated in Yushchenko calling an early parliamentary election on 8 October 2008.

Tymoshenko was fiercely opposed to the snap election, stating &quot;No politician would throw Ukraine into snap elections at this important time. But, if Yushchenko and Yanukovych – who are ideologists of snap elections – throw the country into snap elections, then they will bear responsibility for all the consequences of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 on Ukraine&quot;. Initially, the election was to be held on 7 December 2008, but was later postponed to an unknown date. Tymoshenko had no intention of resigning until a new coalition was formed.

In early December 2008, there were negotiations between BYuT and the Party of Regions to form a coalition, but after Volodymyr Lytvyn was elected Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (parliament of Ukraine) on 9 December 2008, he announced the creation of a coalition between his Lytvyn Bloc, BYuT and OU-PSD. After negotiations, the three parties officially signed the coalition agreement on 16 December. It was not known whether this coalition would stop the snap election, although Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn predicted the Verkhovna Rada would work until 2012.

On 5 February 2009, Tymoshenko&#x27;s opponents in the parliament were trying to dismiss her government again, but again the vote failed. The following day, president Yushchenko strongly criticized Tymoshenko and the economic policies of her government. Tymoshenko accused him of spreading &quot;a mix of untruths, panic and hysteria.&quot;

On 18 December 2008, for the first time Tymoshenko accused the National Bank of Ukraine in the conscious manipulation of the hryvnia, and President Yushchenko of colluding with the leadership of the NBU, which led to depreciation of the national currency to the level of ₴8 per US dollar.

A large part of Tymoshenko&#x27;s second term as prime minister coincided in time with the financial crisis of 2007–2008, which required her government to respond to numerous challenges that could have led the country&#x27;s economic collapse.

Tymoshenko&#x27;s government launched an anti-corruption campaign and identified it as one of its priorities.

===Gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine (2009)===

The conditions leading to the 2009 gas dispute were created in 2006, under the Yushchenko government, when Ukraine started buying Russian gas through an intermediary, Swiss-registered RosUkrEnergo. (Fifty percent of RosUkrEnergo shares were owned by the Russian Gazprom, with 45 percent and 5 percent owned by Ukrainian businessmen Dmytro Firtash and Ivan Fursin, respectively). Some sources indicate that notorious criminal boss Semion Mogilevich (associated with Dmytro Firtash) also owned shares in the company.

When Tymoshenko resumed her prime minister duties in 2007, she initiated direct relations between Ukraine and Russia with regard to gas trading. A 2 October 2008 Memorandum signed by Tymoshenko and Putin stipulated liquidation of intermediaries in gas deals between the two countries and outlined detailed conditions for future gas contracts. The gas conflict of 2009 broke out because of two factors, the lack of a gas contract for 2009 and a $2.4 billion debt that Ukraine had yet to pay for gas received in 2008. Tymoshenko stated that it was the RosUkrEnergo company that was responsible for the debt, rather than the state of Ukraine. She called for an end to corruption in the gas trade area and the establishment of direct contracts with the Russian Federation.

RosUkrEnergo, with the aid of its ties to Yushchenko&#x27;s administration, managed to disrupt the signing of a gas contract scheduled for 31 December 2008. Alexey Miller, head of Gazprom, stated that trader RosUkrEnergo broke down talks between Gazprom and Naftogaz Ukrainy: &quot;Yes indeed, in late December 2008, the prime ministers of Russia and Ukraine came to agreement, and our companies were ready to seal the deal for $235 per 1000 cubic meters of natural gas with the condition that all the export operations from Ukraine will be done bilaterally. RosUkrEnergo then suggested to buy gas at $285 price.&quot; On 31 December 2008, Yushchenko gave Oleg Dubyna, head of Naftogaz Ukrainy, a direct order to stop talks, not sign the agreement and recall the delegation from Moscow. The decision made by the president of Ukraine brought on the crisis.

On 14 January 2009, Tymoshenko said, &quot;The negotiations on $235 gas price and $1.7–1.8 transit price, that started on October 2 and successfully have been moving forward since, have been broken up because, unfortunately, Ukrainian politicians were trying to keep RosUkrEnergo in business as a shadow intermediary... The negotiations between the two prime ministers and later between Gazprom and Naftogaz Ukrainy were ruined by those Ukrainian political groups, who have gotten and are planning to get corrupt benefits from RosUkrEnergo.&quot; On 17 January 2009, President of Russia Dmitriy Medvedev said, &quot;I think that our Ukrainian partners and us can trade gas without any intermediaries, especially without intermediaries with questionable reputation. The problem is that some participants of negotiations insisted on keeping the intermediary referring to the instructions from the top.&quot;

On 1 January 2009, at 10 am, Gazprom completely stopped pumping gas to Ukraine. On 4 January, the Russian monopolist offered to sell Ukraine gas for $450 per 1000 cubic meter (minus a fee for gas transit through Ukraine), which was defined as a standard price for Eastern European countries. On 8 January 2009, the prime minister of Russia, Vladimir Putin, said that Ukraine would have to pay $470 for 1000 cubic meters of natural gas.

Between 1 and 18 January, Central and Eastern European countries received significantly less gas. Ukrainian heat-and-power stations were working to utmost capacity. Due to sub-zero temperatures, the entire housing and public utilities sectors were on the verge of collapse. On 14 January, the European Commission and the Czech presidency in the European Union demanded the immediate renewal of gas deliveries in full capacity lest the reputations of Russia and Ukraine as reliable EU partners be seriously damaged. On 18 January 2009, after five-day-long talks, prime ministers Putin and Tymoshenko came to agreement on the renewal of gas delivery to Ukraine and other EU countries. The parties agreed upon the following: A return to direct contract deals between Gazprom and Naftogaz Ukrainy; the removal of non-transparent intermediaries; the introduction of formula-based pricing for Ukraine (which also works for other Eastern European countries); and a switch to a $2.7 transit fee, which is close to the average price in Europe. According to the new gas contract, in 2009 Ukraine paid an average price of $232.98 per 1000 cubic meters, while other European consumers were paying above $500 per 1000 cubic meters.

===2010 presidential election===
Tymoshenko was a candidate in the Ukrainian presidential elections of 2010, but lost that election to Viktor Yanukovych (Tymoshenko received 45.47% of the votes in the second and final round of the election, 3% less than her rival).

In 2009, the relations between Tymoshenko and Yushchenko, the Secretariat of the President of Ukraine and the oppositional Party of Regions remained hostile. This company then was owned by Dmitry Firtash – 45%, by Yushchenko family – 27%, and the Russian Gazprom. In 2007, Tymoshenko argued for a direct contract for gas supplies from Russia to Ukraine. In 2008, the two prime ministers signed a Memorandum on the elimination of gas intermediaries. She emphasized early in February 2009 that the &quot;election struggle for the next presidential elections has virtually begun.&quot;

&quot;This is a competition during economic crisis; [some people] prefer to collect political benefits from these problems instead of solving them together&quot;, Tymoshenko said in an interview with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in February 2009. Later, in an interview with the French paper Le Monde, the prime minister said that &quot;the president treats her as a rival striving for president&#x27;s office.&quot; She also added that the previously mentioned political instability fuels economic crisis. Tymoshenko then called for an early presidential election.

Having long being considered a possible candidate for President of Ukraine in the 2010 election, Tymoshenko announced that she would indeed compete in the upcoming presidential election in a statement broadcast live on national TV on 7 June 2009. Tymoshenko also stated that if she lost the presidential election she would not challenge the results. On 12 September 2009, a tour in support of Tymoshenko&#x27;s candidacy, called &quot;With Ukraine in Heart&quot;, began on Kyiv&#x27;s Maidan Nezalezhnosti. Popular Ukrainian singers and bands took part in the tour.

On 24 October 2009, the delegates of all-Ukrainian union &quot;Batkivshchyna&quot; formally and unanimously endorsed Tymoshenko as their candidate for the next Presidential election. The 200 thousand congress took place on Kyiv&#x27;s Independence Square. On 31 October 2009, the Central Election Commission registered Tymoshenko as a candidate for presidential election in 2010.

The Tymoshenko candidacy was also endorsed by prominent Ukrainian politicians such as Borys Tarasyuk, Yuriy Lutsenko, former President Leonid Kravchuk, the Christian Democratic Union, the European Party of Ukraine and others. Putin stated that he was cooperating with Tymoshenko as Prime Minister of Ukraine, but that he was not supporting her in the election.

Tymoshenko&#x27;s campaign was expected to have cost $100 to $150 million.

Tymoshenko expected early parliamentary elections after the 2010 presidential election if Yanukovych won the vote, but she was against this.

On 1 December 2009, Tymoshenko urged &quot;national democratic forces&quot; to unite around the candidate who garnered the largest number of votes after the first round of the presidential elections. &quot;If we are not able to strengthen our efforts and unite the whole national-patriotic and democratic camp of Ukraine... we will be much weaker than those who want revenge.&quot; On 5 December 2009, she declared she would go into opposition if she lost the presidential election. She also complained of flaws in the election legislation, and expressed her certainty that attempts were being made by her opponents to carry out vote rigging.
In the first round of the presidential election on 17 January 2010, Tymoshenko took second place with 25% of the vote, and Yanukovych took first place with 35%. The two proceeded to a runoff.

On 3 February 2010, two days before the run-off, the deputies from Party of Regions, Communist Party of Ukraine, &quot;Our Ukraine – People&#x27;s Self-Defense&quot; bloc and independent MPs amended the Law on Election of President, which changed the mode of composition and functioning of election commissions. BYuT warned that these amendments would create opportunities for the massive rigging of elections. Tymoshenko called on president Yushchenko to veto the law. Hanne Severinsen, former rapporteur of PACE Monitoring Committee on Ukraine, also called on the president to veto the law. Severinsen&#x27;s statement read: &quot;Unfortunately, the Party of Regions, as in 2004, is trying to create conditions for vote fraud.&quot;

Despite these requests, Yushchenko signed the amended Law. This action generated vast international criticism from the Council of Europe and from members of the US congress&#x27; Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Committee of Voters of Ukraine stated that the amendments to the Law on Election of President &quot;contained the biggest threats for democratic mode of the run-off.&quot;

Tymoshenko did not receive endorsement from other candidates who had not survived the first round of voting. In the run-off held on 7 February 2010, Yanukovych was elected President of Ukraine. According to the Central Election Commission, he received 48.95% of the votes; Tymoshenko received 45.47% of the votes. Tymoshenko won 17 of 27 constituencies in the western, central and north regions of Ukraine and in Kyiv.

Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc members immediately claimed that there was systematic and large-scale vote rigging in the run-off election. However, Tymoshenko herself did not issue a statement about the election until a live televised broadcast on 13 February 2010, in which she said that she would challenge the election result in court. Tymoshenko alleged widespread fraud (according to Tymoshenko, a million votes were invalid) and said Yanukovych was not legitimately elected. &quot;Whatever happens in future, he will never become the legitimately elected President of Ukraine.&quot; Tymoshenko did not call people into the streets to protest, and stated that she &quot;won&#x27;t tolerate civil confrontation.&quot;

On 10 February 2010, Yanukovych called on Tymoshenko to abandon her protests and resign as prime minister. Yanukovych stated he wanted to form a new coalition, and may try to call snap parliamentary elections. On 12 February, Yanukovych stated he would not rule out talks with Tymoshenko if she would publicly apologize to him for accusations she made during her election campaign. Tymoshenko&#x27;s government did not want to resign voluntarily.

On 17 February 2010, the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine suspended the results of the election on Tymoshenko&#x27;s appeal. The court suspended the Central Election Commission of Ukraine ruling that announced that Yanukovych won the election. Tymoshenko withdrew her appeal on 20 February 2010, after the Higher Administrative Court in Kyiv rejected her petition to scrutinize documents from election districts in Crimea and to question election and law-enforcement officials. According to Tymoshenko, &quot;It became clear that the court is not out to establish the truth, and, unfortunately, the court is as biased as the Central Election Commission, which includes a political majority from Yanukovych.&quot; Tymoshenko also stated, &quot;At the very least there was rigging of votes using the main methods of falsification, and I think that for history this lawsuit with all the documentation will remain in the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine, and sooner or later, an honest prosecutor&#x27;s office and an honest court will assess that Yanukovych wasn&#x27;t elected President of Ukraine, and that the will of the people had been rigged.&quot;

On 22 February 2010, Tymoshenko announced in a televised speech that she believed the presidential election to have been rigged and did not recognize its results. &quot;As well as millions of Ukrainians, I state: Yanukovych is not our president&quot;, she said. She called on the democratic parliamentary factions to not seek &quot;political employment&quot; at the Party of Regions (meaning to avoid negotiations with the Party of Regions regarding the new coalition) and to &quot;quit arguing and create a united team that would not let an anti-Ukrainian dictatorship usurp the power&quot;.

===In opposition after 2010 presidential election===

During a nationally televised address on 22 February, Tymoshenko said of President-elect Yanukovych and &quot;Yanukovych&#x27;s team&quot; (she referred to them in the speech as &quot;The oligarchy&quot;): &quot;They need cheap labour, poor and disenfranchised people who can be forced to work at their factories for peanuts, they also need Ukraine&#x27;s riches, which they have been stealing for the last 18 years.&quot; During the speech she also accused outgoing President Viktor Yushchenko of &quot;opening the door to massive and flagrant election rigging&quot; days before 7 February runoff of the January 2010 presidential election by amending the election law. During a Cabinet of Ministers meeting on 24 February, Tymoshenko stated, &quot;The moment of truth has arrived: The decision whether or not to side with Yanukovych will show who values the preservation of Ukraine&#x27;s independence and self-identity and who does not.&quot; Tymoshenko and her party, Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko, boycotted the inauguration ceremony of Yanukovych on 25 February 2010.

If the Second Tymoshenko Government could not be preserved, Tymoshenko stated on 22 February 2010, she would go into Parliamentary opposition. On 3 March 2010, the Ukrainian Parliament passed a motion of no confidence in the second Tymoshenko Government in which the cabinet was dismissed with 243 lawmakers voting in favour out of 450 (including seven lawmakers of Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko). (Prime Minister Tymoshenko had demanded this vote herself on 1 March 2010.) On 2 March 2010, the coalition had already lost the parliamentary majority. Before the vote on 3 March, Tymoshenko again stated, &quot;If the dismissal of the government is passed today, at that very same moment our government will leave the cabinet. Our political force will cross into the opposition.&quot; Tymoshenko blamed the Lytvyn Bloc and &quot;Our Ukraine, including the leader of Our Ukraine, who announced the position of the faction&quot; for the fall of the cabinet. Tymoshenko resigned from the prime minister post on 4 March 2010. Fellow BYuT member Oleksandr Turchynov was empowered to fulfill the prime minister&#x27;s duties until a new government was formed on 4 March 2010. On 9 and 15 March 2010, Tymoshenko called on &quot;all of the national patriotic forces&quot; to unite against Yanukovych. On 16 March, a shadow government including BYuT was established. On 10 May 2010, the People&#x27;s Committee to Protect Ukraine was established, of which Tymoshenko is one of the representatives. Tymoshenko was against the 2010 Ukrainian-Russian Naval Base for Natural Gas treaty, as she believes the agreement harms Ukraine&#x27;s national interests.

On 12 May 2010, Ukraine&#x27;s prosecutor&#x27;s office illegally re-opened a 2004 criminal case, which had been closed by the Supreme Court of Ukraine in January 2005 against Tymoshenko regarding accusations that she had tried to bribe Supreme Court judges. As she left the prosecutor&#x27;s office on 12 May, Tymoshenko told journalists she had been summoned to see investigators again on 17 May, and she linked the move to Russian President Medvedev&#x27;s visit to Ukraine on 17 and 18 May 2010. Tymoshenko also claimed that she was told by &quot;all the offices of the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office&quot; that President Yanukovych had personally instructed the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office to find any grounds to prosecute her. In a press conference on 12 May, Yanukovych&#x27;s representative in the Parliament, Yury Miroshnychenko, dismissed Tymoshenko&#x27;s statement about Yanukovych&#x27;s personal interest in prosecuting her. &quot;Yanukovych is against political repression for criticism of the regime,&quot; Miroshnychenko stated.

=== The most famous criminal cases against Tymoshenko ===

On 15 December 2010, the General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office instituted a criminal case against Tymoshenko, alleging that she misused funds received by Ukraine within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. She was officially charged on 20 December 2010. Tymoshenko denied the money had been spent on pensions, insisting it was still at the disposal of the environment ministry. She called the investigation against her a witch-hunt. According to government officials, the criminal case against Tymoshenko was a legitimate attempt to uncover corruption by the previous administration. In the case of &quot;Kyoto money&quot; American experts &quot;Covington &amp; Burling&quot; and &quot;BDO USA&quot; stated the following: &quot;the Documents that we were able to see, clearly point out that the Kyoto Target balance account in the amount of approximately 3.3 billion on the date of receipt remained unchanged throughout the period that is considered, and that, moreover, Kyoto funds have not been touched at all in 2009. Since the balance of this account remained unchanged on the date of receipt, any accusations that Prime Minister Tymoshenko &quot;used&quot; these funds contrary to their intended purpose, are obviously false&quot;. On 7 August 2014, the Chairman of the State Treasury service Tatiana Slyuz confirmed that the Tymoshenko government has never spent &quot;Kyoto money&quot;, the funds were on special accounts and in 2010 were transferred to the Yanukovych government. Tymoshenko was not arrested, but ordered not to leave Kyiv while the inquiry was under way. In the same case, the environment minister in the second Tymoshenko Government, Georgiy Filipchuk, was detained. Filipchuk was the third minister from this government to face criminal charges since its fall in March 2010 (prosecutors charged former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko with abuse of office in early December 2010, and former economy minister Bohdan Danylyshyn was detained in the Czech Republic in October 2010 on similar charges). Lawmakers of BYuT blocked the rostrum and presidium of the Verkhovna Rada the next day in protest against this. That same day, the European People&#x27;s Party issued a statement in which it &quot;condemns the growth of aggressive, politically motivated pressure by the Ukrainian authorities on the opposition and its leader Yulia Tymoshenko.&quot; Tymoshenko dismissed the probe as &quot;terror against the opposition by President Yanukovych.&quot; Earlier that month, Ukraine&#x27;s Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka had stated that there were no political reasons for the interrogations of the opposition leaders Tymoshenko, Lutsenko and Oleksandr Turchynov.

New corruption charges against Tymoshenko were filed on 27 January 2011. She was accused of using 1,000 medical vehicles for campaigning in the presidential elections of 2010. According to Tymoshenko, the charges were false and part of &quot;Yanukovych&#x27;s campaign to silence the opposition.&quot; Subsequently, in 2010, the results of the audit of the accounts chamber revealed that the acquisition of these vehicles was provided for from 2008 in the article 87 of the Budget code, the State budget-2009 and article 13 of the Law of Ukraine &quot;On state target programs&quot;. In June 2011, the case on the &quot;Kyoto money&quot; and of medical assistance vehicles to the village were suspended — after auditing company &quot;BDO USA&quot;, which has branches in over one hundred countries around the world, and a large law firm &quot;Covington &amp; Burling&quot; investigated these cases and stated that they &quot;are not worth the paper on which they are written.&quot;

A third criminal case against Tymoshenko in connection with alleged abuse of power during the 2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute was opened on 10 April 2011. This case was labelled &quot;absurd&quot; by Tymoshenko. On 24 May 2011, prosecutors charged her in connection with this (third criminal) case. She was not arrested.

On 26 April 2011, Tymoshenko sued businessman Dmytro Firtash and Swiss-based RosUkrEnergo in a US District Court in Manhattan, accusing them of &quot;defrauding Ukraine&#x27;s citizenry by manipulating an arbitration court ruling&quot; and &quot;undermining the rule of law in Ukraine&quot; in connection with a 2010 international arbitration court ruling in Stockholm that ordered Ukraine&#x27;s state energy company Naftogaz to pay RosUkrEnergo 11 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas to compensate for fuel it had &quot;expropriated&quot; plus 1.1 billion bcm as a penalty.

Throughout Yanukovych&#x27;s presidency, Tymoshenko stayed very critical of his and the Azarov Government&#x27;s performances and intentions which, among others, she accused of selling out to Russia and of being a &quot;funeral of democracy.&quot; Tymoshenko has accused &quot;many of Ukraine&#x27;s neighbours&quot; of turning a blind eye to &quot;Yanukovych&#x27;s strangulation of Ukraine&#x27;s democracy, some openly celebrate the supposed &#x27;stability&#x27; that his regime has imposed.&quot; She believes &quot;Ukraine can return to a democratic path of development only with an active civil society and support from the international community.&quot;

===2011 trial and imprisonment and other criminal cases against Tymoshenko===


In May 2010, the Ukrainian General Prosecutor&#x27;s office started a number of criminal cases against Tymoshenko which prevented her from normal political activity and from international travel to her allies in the West. The European Parliament passed a resolution condemning the Yanukovych government for persecution of Tymoshenko as well as for prosecution in the &quot;Gas case&quot; and other cases against her and her ministers. On 24 June 2011, a trial started in the &quot;gas case&quot;, concerning a contract signed in 2009 with Gazprom to supply natural gas to Ukraine. Tymoshenko was charged with abuse of power and embezzlement, as the court found the deal anti-economic for the country and abusive.

Tymoshenko&#x27;s trial (she was charged in May 2011) for abuse of office concerning a natural gas imports contract signed with Russia in January 2009 started on 24 June 2011 in Kyiv. A number of criminal cases were also opened against former officials from the second Tymoshenko Government. According to Yanukovych, those cases were indiscriminately made to fight corruption in Ukraine. Former President Yushchenko testified against Tymoshenko during the trial, which he called &quot;a normal judicial process.&quot; The trial against Tymoshenko has been referred to as &quot;selective justice&quot; and &quot;political persecution&quot; in statements by the U.S., Russia, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain and other European countries; in statements by the European Union, NATO, the European People&#x27;s Party; and in statements by human rights organizations such as Transparency International, Freedom House, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Following her conviction, Tymoshenko remained under criminal investigation for ten criminal acts; Ukrainian prosecutors have claimed Tymoshenko committed even more criminal acts.

Early in July 2011, the Ukrainian security service (SBU) opened a new criminal investigation into alleged non-delivery of goods by United Energy Systems of Ukraine (in 1996) to Russia for $405.5 million, the SBU maintains that Russia may claim this sum to the State budget of Ukraine (this criminal case was closed in Russia in December 2005 due to lapse of time).

On 11 October 2011, the court found Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of power and sentenced her to seven years in prison, banned her from seeking elected office for her period of imprisonment, and ordered her to pay the state $188 million. She was convicted for exceeding her powers as prime minister by ordering Naftogaz to sign the gas deal with Russia in 2009. Tymoshenko did appeal the sentence, which she compared to Stalin&#x27;s Great Terror, on 24 October 2011.

A 2001 criminal case on state funds embezzlement and tax evasion charges against Tymoshenko was reopened in Ukraine on 24 October 2011. On 4 November 2011, the Ukrainian tax police resumed four criminal cases against Tymoshenko. She was charged for these cases on 10 November 2011. Tymoshenko was re-arrested (while in prison) on 8 December 2011, after a Ukrainian court ordered her indefinite arrest as part of the investigation of alleged tax evasion and theft of government funds (between 1996 and 2000) by United Energy Systems of Ukraine. Again, the EU showed concern over this.

On 23 December 2011, Tymoshenko lost her appeal against her sentence for abuse of power. She and her lawyers had boycotted the appeal proceedings, claiming that the &quot;judicial system and justice are totally non-existent in Ukraine today.&quot; Tymoshenko lodged a complaint against the verdict at the European Court of Human Rights, which was given priority treatment by the court. On 30 December 2011, Tymoshenko was transferred to the Kachanivska penal colony in Kharkiv.

In early January 2012, Tymoshenko&#x27;s husband Oleksandr was granted asylum in the Czech Republic, which he had requested at the end of the previous year.

In early April 2012, the General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office began examining the possible involvement of Tymoshenko and former prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko in the murder of Donetsk businessman Olexandr Momot in 1996.

A trial concerning alleged misappropriating public funds of United Energy Systems of Ukraine started on 19 April 2012 in Kharkiv. Tymoshenko refused to attend the trial, citing problems with her health. Tymoshenko was then moved against her will from Kachanivska prison to a hospital where she began a hunger strike on 20 April to protest – according to her lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko – &quot;what is happening in the country and what is happening to her in prison.&quot; She ended the hunger strike on 9 May 2012. Beginning on 9 May 2012, she received treatment at the hospital after being diagnosed with a spinal disc herniation.

The Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the verdict against Tymoshenko on 29 August 2012.

From 29 October to 16 November 2012, Tymoshenko was again on a hunger strike to protest vote rigging in the October 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election.

Fatherland United Opposition nominated Tymoshenko as its candidate for the Ukrainian presidential elections of 2015 on 7 December 2012. On 14 June 2013, the congress of her party approved the decision to nominate her as its candidate in the 2015 Ukrainian presidential election.

On 18 January 2013, Tymoshenko was notified that she was a suspect in the murder of businessman and lawmaker Yevhen Shcherban, his wife and two other people in 1996. In May 2013, the Shcherban murder case was suspended.

From 25 November to 6 December 2013 (during the Euromaidan protests), Tymoshenko was again on a hunger strike in protest of &quot;President Yanukovych&#x27;s reluctance to sign the DCFTA&quot; on 6 December.

====Appeal====

On 24 October 2011, Tymoshenko filed an appeal to the decision of Pechersk district court of Kyiv regarding the &quot;gas case&quot;. On 1 December, the Kyiv Court of Appeal started hearing the case. Tymoshenko herself was not present in the courtroom because of her health condition. After the hearing, the judge, Olena Sitaylo, had to call an ambulance and was hospitalized. On 13 December 2011, the Kyiv Court of Appeal resumed the hearing. All subsequent court sessions took place without Tymoshenko&#x27;s presence. Immediately prior to the hearing of the appeal, the board of judges was altered: Sitaylo, the chief justice, was appointed the day before the first hearing; other justices were appointed several days prior to the court session. Thus, the judges did not have time to study the 84-page case log. The manner of the process proved that the decision to alter the board of judges was made beforehand. At the very end, Tymoshenko&#x27;s defense boycotted the court session.

On 23 December 2011, the Kyiv Court of Appeal issued a ruling which fully supported the verdict of the Pechersk court. The judges didn&#x27;t find any violations during the pre-trial investigation or trial on the &quot;gas case&quot;, overruling the claims of Tymoshenko&#x27;s defense.

====Cassation====
On 26 January 2012, Tymoshenko&#x27;s defense submitted a cassation appeal to the High Specialized Court for Civil and Criminal Cases regarding the &quot;gas case&quot; verdict. On 16 August 2012, after a 7-month delay that impeded filing the case to the European Court of Human Rights, the panel of judges of the aforementioned court began hearing the case. The panel finished hearing the case on 21 August and went to the jury room to make decision. The ruling of the Court, issued on 29 August 2012, stated that the appeal of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko&#x27;s defense on the &quot;gas case&quot; should not be satisfied.

Media, diplomats, members of parliament and members of an EU special monitoring mission, Pat Cox and Aleksander Kwaśniewski, attended the court sessions. The ruling was announced on the day following public hearing of &quot;Tymoshenko vs Ukraine&quot; (regarding unlawful arrest of ex-prime minister and holding her in custody) case at the European Court of Human Rights.

The European Union, PACE, and governments of the United States, Great Britain and Canada expressed frustration with the cassation ruling. &quot;We are deeply disappointed with the consequences of the current situation, when two important opposition leaders cannot stand in the upcoming parliamentary elections, [and] when the court disrespects international standards for fair and transparent processes&quot;, a representative of the European Commission, Michael Mann, said in Brussels on 29 August 2012.

====International reactions====
The &quot;gas case&quot; trial was viewed by many European and American organizations as a politically charged persecution that violates the law. The EU and multiple international organizations see the conviction as &quot;justice being applied selectively under political motivation.&quot;

In June 2012, the European Parliament established a special monitoring mission to Ukraine, conducted by former European Parliament President Pat Cox and former Polish President Aleksander Kwaśniewski. Both politicians observed trials, repeatedly visited Tymoshenko in custody and conducted meetings with Ukraine&#x27;s authorities regarding her release.

The European Union shelved the European Union Association Agreement and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the Ukrainian government over the issue.

On 30 April 2013, the European Court of Human Rights issued a judgment asserting that &quot;Ms. Tymoshenko&#x27;s pre-trial detention had been arbitrary; that the lawfulness of her detention had not been properly reviewed; and, that she had no possibility to seek compensation for her unlawful deprivation of liberty.&quot;

Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) has adopting a resolution on &quot;Keeping political and criminal responsibility separate&quot; in which former prime minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko is recognized as a political prisoner.

The United States Senate passed two resolutions calling for the release from prison of former prime minister Tymoshenko. The most recent, presented in the Senate in June 2013, called for Tymoshenko&#x27;s release in light of the recent European Court of Human Rights ruling, and was adopted on 18 November 2013. An earlier resolution, passed in 2012, condemned the politically motivated prosecution and imprisonment of former prime minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko.

On 2 October 2013, the PACE adopted a resolution calling for the immediate release of Tymoshenko and, two days later, Pat Cox and Aleksander Kwaśniewski, representatives of the European Parliament mission, handed president Yanukovych a petition to pardon Tymoshenko.

In December 2012, the united opposition nominated her and later in June 2013 confirmed her as its candidate in the 2015 Ukrainian presidential election.

==== Aftermath — Manafort case ====

According to the September 2018 indictment in which Paul Manafort confessed as part of a plea bargain with U.S. special prosecutor Robert Mueller, Manafort and his partner Tony Podesta, brother of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign manager John Podesta, helped the former Ukrainian President to conduct a media campaign in the West directed against Tymoshenko in order to undermine the support for her by the administration of then U.S. President Barack Obama. In exchange for his testimony against Manafort, Mueller gave Tony Podesta and The Podesta Group complete amnesty, including not prosecuting them for being unregistered agents of a foreign government.

The campaign was designed to make Tymoshenko look like a supporter of anti-Semitism. The indictment also states that in July 2011, former U.S. journalist Alan Friedman sent Manafort a confidential six-page document entitled &quot;Ukraine – the digital road map&quot;, which contained a plan for &quot;destruction&quot; of Tymoshenko using video, articles and social networks. The plan included creating a website, posting on the Internet, and sending out e-mails to &quot;the target audience in Europe and the U.S.&quot; It was also proposed to edit the page of Yulia Tymoshenko in Wikipedia in order to emphasize the &quot;corruption and legal proceedings&quot; related to her.

===2014 release from prison===
Following the Revolution of Dignity, on 21 February 2014, Parliament voted for her release in a 310–54 veto-proof vote. To do so, the members of parliament decriminalized the Article on which Tymoshenko was charged and brought it into compliance with Article 19 of the UN Convention against corruption. That could enable immediate release of Tymoshenko through the corresponding court ruling. However, Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after massive violent clashes in Kyiv that killed more than 80 people without signing the bill into law. On 22 February 2014, the Verkhovna Rada with 322 votes adopted a decree based on the decision of the European Court of Human Rights and corresponding decision of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.

On the same day, Tymoshenko was released from Central Clinical Hospital No. 5 in Kharkiv, where she had been receiving treatment under police guard since May 2012, after being diagnosed with a spinal disc herniation.
Her release was praised by western leaders.

On 28 February 2014, the parliament rehabilitated Yulia Tymoshenko and restored her rights. That enabled her to run for office; however, she has ruled out becoming prime minister again.

Kyivsky District Court of Kharkiv closed the criminal case on financial abuse of the United Energy Systems of Ukraine on 28 February 2014. And, on 14 April, the Supreme Court of Ukraine closed the &quot;gas case&quot; against Tymoshenko for &quot;absence of a criminal act&quot;.

On 25 April 2014, the General Prosecutor of Ukraine launched a pre-trial investigation against a number of officials from its own office and the Pechersky district court and Kyiv&#x27;s court of appeals (the judges who had sentenced Tymoshenko) because of allegedly &quot;deliberate, systematic and flagrant violation of accused Yulia Tymoshenko&#x27;s rights to defense, which are granted by Ukraine&#x27;s current laws&quot;.

On 24 June 2014, the Supreme Court of Ukraine rehabilitated Tymoshenko.

On 22 January 2015, the European Court of Human Rights announced the termination of consideration of the case of &quot;Yulia Tymoshenko v. Ukraine&quot; in connection to an implied friendly settlement between the parties, after Tymoshenko&#x27;s agreement with the government&#x27;s declaration admitting that the criminal prosecution against her had been politically motivated. The Ukrainian government, in its exchange with the Court, had acknowledged a violation of Tymoshenko&#x27;s rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights under articles 3 (prohibition of torture), 6 (right to a fair trial), 7 (no punishment without law), 8 (right to respect for private and family life), partly in conjunction with article 13 (right to an effective remedy), article 18 (political motivation), article 10 (freedom of expression) and article 4 of Protocol No. 7 to the convention (right not to be tried or punished twice). Taking note of the Ukrainian government&#x27;s declaration and following measures, as well as of Tymoshenko&#x27;s agreement with it, the Court struck out the application from its list of cases, as asked by the government, following article 39 of the convention (friendly settlements).

On 19 October 2015, the Kominternivskyi district court of Kharkiv has sentenced two former employees of the Kachanivska penal colony No. 54 to three years in prison for inflicting injuries on Tymoshenko.

===Political activities after release===

Immediately after her release from prison on 22 February 2014, Yulia Tymoshenko travelled to Kyiv, where she attended a makeshift memorial to the first slain protesters on Hrushevskogo Street and gave a speech on Maidan stage. In the following days, she had a number of meetings and phone conversations with USA, EU, and OSCE officials. Tymoshenko addressed the European Union, leaders of western democracies and of countries which guaranteed Ukraine&#x27;s territorial unity according to the Budapest Memorandum; she called for action to stop what she called the &quot;Russian aggression&quot;.

From 6 to 7 March, Tymoshenko attended a political conference of the European People&#x27;s Party in Dublin, where she openly discussed events with Angela Merkel, Jose Manuel Barroso, Viviane Reding, Michel Barnier, Mariano Rajoy and Donald Tusk, amongst other notable figures. On 7 March 2014, she was admitted to the Charité hospital in Berlin, Germany, for treatment of her severe back problems.

Upon her return to Kyiv, Tymoshenko gathered military and defense experts and suggested launching a special headquarters that would elaborate responses to threats coming from Russia.

On 27 March 2014, at a press conference in Kyiv, Tymoshenko stated that she would run in the 2014 presidential election. Two days later, the congress of Batkivshchyna party officially nominated her and on 31 March the Central Election Commission officially registered her as a candidate. The key theses of Tymoshenko&#x27;s election campaign were the eradication of corruption, the fight against oligarchs, the European path of Ukraine&#x27;s development (in particular, the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU), countering Russian aggression and restoring the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The election took place on 25 May. Tymoshenko came a distant second behind Petro Poroshenko. She received 12.39% of the vote.

In the elections Tymoshenko was placed second on the parties electoral list, after Nadiya Savchenko. After the election Tymoshenko again became faction leader. She is a member of the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada on issues of European integration in the 8th convocation of parliament.

After the election, Tymoshenko began reforming the Batkivshchyna party.

=== Elections of the President of Ukraine ===
On March 27, 2014, at a press conference in Kyiv, Yulia Tymoshenko announced her decision to run for president. On March 29, the &quot;Batkivshchyna&quot; congress, which took place on Sofia Maidan, nominated her for the post of President of Ukraine.

The key theses of Tymoshenko&#x27;s pre-election program were the eradication of corruption, the fight against oligarchs, the European path of Ukraine&#x27;s development (in particular, the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU), countering Russian aggression, and restoring Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity.

In order to win the presidential elections and the subsequent political struggle, Ukrainian presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko hired political technologist Tal Zilbershtein, who once advised ex-Prime Minister of Israel Ehud Olmert, to her team.

Yulia Tymoshenko took second place with a result of 12.81% in the extraordinary elections of the President of Ukraine, which took place in one round on May 25, 2014. Petro Poroshenko won the election.

The program contains four blocks:
# New social contract
# New economic course
# New World Strategy
# Ecosystem of human life

===2019 presidential election===

On 20 June 2018, Tymoshenko announced that she would take part in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election. She was a heavy favorite in the polls until early 2019. Two weeks before the election, candidate Serhiy Taruta pledged his campaign-team would support Tymoshenko&#x27;s campaign efforts (however, his name was not taken off the ballot, the deadline to withdraw having been exceeded).
On 8 February 2019, a new presidential candidate was registered with the same surname and initials as Yulia Tymoshenko – the non-factional people&#x27;s deputy Yury V. Tymoshenko. It was done with the intention that the voters, especially older people, would make a mistake on the ballot. Tymoshenko herself called it a &quot;dirty&quot; move by Poroshenko]

For a long period before the start of the election campaign, Tymoshenko was the leader of opinion polls. The situation changed after the actor Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s announcement of his intention to run for president, after which it was Zelenskyy who began to gain a rating, beating Tymoshenko at the end of January 2019. Later, during the entire election campaign, Tymoshenko shared 2–3 positions in the rating together with the current President Petro Poroshenko.

The first round of the election was held on 31 March 2019. With 13.4% of the vote, Tymoshenko came in third behind Zelenskyy (30.2%) and the incumbent Poroshenko (15.9%). While she conceded defeat, she also accused Poroshenko of manipulating the results.

In the 2019 parliamentary election, she led the &quot;Fatherland&quot; list which came in third, with 8.18% of the vote and 26 seats in parliament, in ahead of European Solidarity list led by Poroshenko (8.10%).

===Local elections 2020===
According to the results of the CEC, Tymoshenko&#x27;s party received 4093 deputy mandates (12.39%) and became one of the leading parties in local elections in Ukraine.

===Parliamentary and political activities (2019–2021)===

In the 2019 parliamentary election, she led the Batkivshchyna list which came in third, with 8.18% of the vote and 26 seats in parliament. Tymoshenko became a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Social Policy and Protection of Veterans&#x27; Rights. Tymoshenko&#x27;s activities in this session of the Rada focussed on opposition to lifting the moratorium on land sales and pushing for government action to lower energy prices.

At the start of the term, Tymoshenko&#x27;s party supported a number of measures put forward by the ruling Servant of the People party. On the first day of the new session of the Rada, Tymoshenko&#x27;s party supported the bill on lifting parliamentary immunity. On 3 September 2019, the Batkivshchyna party supported the referral to the Constitutional Court of a bill to reduce the number of deputies.

However, in November 2019, after the parliament passed a bill to lift the moratorium on land sales, Yulia Tymoshenko announced her transition to opposition to the ruling Servant of the People party. On 18 November 2019, Tymoshenko appealed to the Constitutional Court to immediately consider the petition for the bill on the &quot;land market&quot;. In December 2019, Tymoshenko united more than 40 political and public organizations that oppose the sale of land in the National Headquarters for the Protection of Native Land. On 15 December 2019, the National Headquarters approved demands to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that it be necessary to postpone the adoption of &quot;land laws&quot;, extend the moratorium and announce a referendum. The National Corps also joined the all-Ukrainian protest action initiated by the National Headquarters for the Protection of the Motherland. On 19 December 2019, Yulia Tymoshenko and Batkivshchyna deputies addressed the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine with a statement pointing to conflicts of interest and corruption in the Parliamentary Committee on Agrarian Policy during the consideration of the law on land sales.

In November 2020, Tymoshenko&#x27;s party supported the all-Ukrainian SaveFOP campaign by registering Bill 3853–2 to simplify the taxation system for small businesses. Tymoshenko signed a memorandum of cooperation with the public movement SaveFOP.

On 11 January 2021, Tymoshenko called on the authorities to provide Ukrainians with gas at a price no higher than the purchase price. According to Tymoshenko, the price of gas should not exceed ₴3, in this regard, Batkivshchyna registered Bill No. 1177 in the Verkhovna Rada. On 27 January, Tymoshenko initiated a referendum on five issues: the supply of Ukrainian gas and nuclear electricity to the population with a 30% profitability; on the sale of agricultural land; on the sale of strategic property; the issue of legalization of cannabis; about the gambling business. At the same time, Zelenskyy criticized Tymoshenko&#x27;s referendum, although he himself initiated a nationwide poll on 5 issues, as well as the strengthening of democracy in Ukraine. On 1 March, the Batkivshchyna party demanded that the Government stop importing electricity from Russia and Belarus to Ukraine and launch an investigation into the matter. According to Tymoshenko, the import of Belarusian and Russian electricity threatens the national security of the country.

In June, Tymoshenko took part in a meeting of the All-Ukrainian People&#x27;s Council on holding a referendum against the sale of agricultural land. On 21 July, Tymoshenko announced that the Batkivshchyna party had drafted a new Constitution of Ukraine, which provided for the division of power into four branches of government: legislative, executive, judicial, and control. In September, Tymoshenko called on the Verkhovna Rada to adopt bill No. 4680, which provides for the supply of domestically produced gas to Ukrainian citizens at a low price/ On 28 September, Tymoshenko registered in the Verkhovna Rada a Draft Resolution &quot;On the Creation of a Temporary Investigative Commission to Investigate the Activities of NJSC Naftogaz&quot;. On 23 October, Tymoshenko registered in the Verkhovna Rada a draft resolution &quot;On urgent measures to overcome an emergency level crisis that has developed as a result of an increase in energy prices&quot; and a draft law &quot;On Amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine on the introduction of a reduced value added tax rate on energy carriers and related services&quot;. On 26 October, Tymoshenko handed over medical equipment for patients with coronavirus to the Oleksandrivska Clinical Hospital in Kyiv.

===Parliamentary and political activities (2022–present)===
On 27 January 2022, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a resolution initiated by Tymoshenko to establish a Temporary Commission of Inquiry to investigate possible corruption that caused significant losses to the revenue side of the state budget, in particular as a result of NJSC Naftogaz. Tymoshenko became a member of this VSC. On 20 June, the Batkivshchyna faction, led by Yulia Tymoshenko, announced its opposition the ratification of the Istanbul Convention. Tymoshenko believes that the Istanbul Convention is not included in the package of requirements of the EU for granting Ukraine a candidate. She noted that the Verkhovna Rada went against the will of Ukrainians, because such an important issue should be determined at a national referendum. On 19 July, deputies of the Batkivshchyna faction prevented the theft of 264 billion hryvnias from the budget, which Naftogaz of Ukraine was supposed to spend on an opaque scheme for financing the purchase of natural gas for the next heating season. On 29 July during a working visit to Japan, Tymoshenko discussed the situation in Ukraine with Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike. On the same day, Tymoshenko spoke at a conference in Tokyo and called for the creation of a new stable security order in the world.

====2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine====
In late February 2022, Yulia Tymoshenko urged NATO and the United Nations to protect Ukraine by closing its airspace and deploying peacekeeping forces to the country. She later stated that Putin aims to recreate the Soviet Union, posing a threat to Eastern Europe, and emphasized that Ukraine&#x27;s NATO membership is crucial for its security. In early March, Tymoshenko took custody of the Okhmatdyt children&#x27;s hospital, donating medicines and helping evacuate sick children from Kyiv. She also established the Center for Humanitarian Aid to assist vulnerable populations and the Ukrainian military.

Throughout 2022, Tymoshenko actively advocated for Ukraine&#x27;s integration into the EU and NATO, participating in various international forums. She met with European leaders to discuss Ukraine&#x27;s humanitarian situation and global food security and spoke out against peace negotiations with Russia without the full restoration of Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity. Tymoshenko&#x27;s international engagements included a call to rebuild the global security system and counter Russian disinformation.

In 2023, Tymoshenko continued her humanitarian efforts, raising funds for military hospitals and supporting wounded Ukrainian soldiers. She also took part in international conferences, advocating for Ukraine&#x27;s needs and criticizing Russia&#x27;s aggression. Her parliamentary activities included opposing legislation that would harm businesses and advocating for improved medical treatment and rehabilitation for soldiers.

In 2024, Tymoshenko faced increased pressure from Russia, being placed on its wanted list. Despite this, she continued her leadership in the Batkivshchyna party, marking its 25th anniversary by organizing humanitarian aid for the Ukrainian military. She also initiated a parliamentary investigation into corruption in Ukraine&#x27;s energy sector and remained active in international diplomacy, addressing corruption and advocating for Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty.

==Political views==
Tymoshenko wants her country to become a member state of the EU, while also expressing concern about antagonizing Russia, saying: &quot;I try to defend our interests so that we can find a balance in our relations both with the EU and Russia.&quot; Tymoshenko supports Ukraine joining NATO, stating it would be &quot;uncomfortable&quot; for Ukraine to remain &quot;in a void, outside all existing security systems&quot;. According to Tymoshenko, the question of Ukraine joining any system of collective security would &quot;be resolved only by referendum&quot;. Tymoshenko favours close relations with the EU, including the creation of a free trade area between Ukraine and the EU and later a full EU membership. According to Tymoshenko, &quot;The European project has not been completed as yet. It has not been completed because there is no full-fledged participation of Ukraine.&quot; She opposes foreign intervention in internal Ukrainian affairs: &quot;Ukraine&#x27;s realization of its sovereign rights, forming a modern political nation, cannot be considered as a policy aimed against anyone.&quot; Tymoshenko does not want to expand the lease contract of the Russian Black Sea fleet in Ukraine, saying: &quot;The Constitution of Ukraine quite clearly stipulates that foreign military bases cannot be deployed in Ukraine, and this constitutional clause is the fundamental basis of the state&#x27;s security.&quot; She also believes in &quot;building a genuine civil society&quot; as the best way to help democracy.

Tymoshenko regards Ukraine as a &quot;unitary and indivisible state&quot;. Tymoshenko considers separatist attitudes in Ukraine unacceptable: &quot;Love one another, from Donetsk, Crimea, Luhansk, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Lviv, Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kyiv and all the other corners of our native land.&quot; According to Tymoshenko, citizens in Russian-speaking Dnipropetrovsk already understood Ukrainian in Soviet times and that problems surrounding the Russian language in Ukraine were &quot;exaggerated and don&#x27;t exist&quot;. Tymoshenko opposes the introduction of Russian as a second official state language. On 7 April 2014, she stated she supported the 2012 language law which is aimed at giving Russian and other minority languages (if in a region the percentage of a national minority exceeded 10%) the status of regional language. About her own attitude toward the Ukrainian language, Tymoshenko has stated that &quot;today I am thinking in Ukrainian... and the fact that I know Russian very well, I think it is not a secret for you... you all know that I was brought up in the Russian speaking region in Dnipropetrovsk, to my mind, I spared no effort to speak Ukrainian as soon as possible as I came in the Government.&quot;

Tymoshenko wrote an article called &quot;Containing Russia&quot; that was published in the May–June 2007 edition of the journal &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. In the article she criticized Russian expansionism. Consequently, the article irked Russia and more than a week after the article was published, Russia responded by calling it an &quot;anti-Russian manifesto&quot; and &quot;an attempt to once again draw dividing lines in Europe.&quot;

The first Tymoshenko Government was in favor of transparent and honest re-privatization of 3,000 enterprises, as with the case of the Kyvorizhstal steel mill. Tymoshenko believes that Ukraine&#x27;s economy is excessively monopolized. Tymoshenko is against privatization of the gas transportation system in Ukraine. Tymoshenko lists the salvation of the economy of Ukraine during the 2008–09 Ukrainian financial crisis as one of her achievements. The second Tymoshenko Government has spent 1.6 billion hryvnya on modernizing the coal mining industry.

Tymoshenko wants to raise the general level of social standards by equalizing salaries in the industrial and social spheres, and pledged in November 2009 to revamp Ukraine&#x27;s hospitals and health system within two years. She also pledged tax breaks for farmers. Other economic policies included compensation for depositors who lost Soviet-era savings, price controls on food and medicines to bring inflation down, and calls for a review of murky privatizations and high social spending. Tymoshenko wants to cut the number of taxes by a third to simplify the system, and wants to cut the Value Added Tax (VAT) and offer tax breaks to importers of new technologies to poor regions to boost investment there. In December 2009, the second Tymoshenko Government proposed creating independent anti-corruption bureaus in Ukraine.

Tymoshenko believes Ukraine can gain energy security and independence, and she wants to speed up exploration and extraction of oil and natural gas from the Black Sea shelf. Considering nuclear power provides almost 50% of the electricity supply in Ukraine, Tymoshenko&#x27;s government agreed to cooperate with the company Westin to establish factory production of nuclear fuel in Ukraine, independent of Russia. She also suggested a 10-year tax break for enterprises that would develop alternative energy sources in Ukraine.

Tymoshenko is for the cancellation of Verkhovna Rada deputies&#x27; immunity from prosecution. For Ukraine, Tymoshenko prefers the proportional representation voting system with open lists. Tymoshenko wants to reform the forming of state executive bodies, and favours giving parliamentary opposition &quot;real instruments of influence on the authorities&quot;. She also wants Ukrainian court system reforms and wants devolution of executive power to local authorities. Together with representatives of regional governments, Tymoshenko expanded a Law that aimed to empower local authorities. In the summer of 2009, she claimed she tried to bring together different political parties in order to amend the constitution and switch to a parliamentary form of government. In February 2011, Tymoshenko stated &quot;Viktor Yanukovych&#x27;s naked attempt to hijack the election that precipitated the Orange Revolution should have resulted in him being banned from running in future elections.&quot;

In November 2009, Tymoshenko called Ukraine &quot;an absolutely ungovernable country&quot; due to the changes to the Constitution of Ukraine as a part of a political compromise between the acting authorities (former-President Kuchma) and opposition during the Orange Revolution. Tymoshenko has characterised those reforms as &quot;incomplete&quot;, and the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc voted against them in December 2004. In January 2010, Tymoshenko called for urgent amendments to the Constitution via the majority of the Verkhovna Rada after a survey or plebiscite is conducted. In April 2011, she still believed the constitution &quot;didn&#x27;t work&quot;.

On 21 May 2016, Tymoshenko expressed hope that the EU will provide Ukraine a visa-free regime. Tymoshenko stressed that the Ukrainian state is there to protect the world all over Europe, continuing to fight the Russian aggression.

==Electoral history==
===Presidential elections===
===Parliamentary elections===
==Family and personal life==
Yulia Tymoshenko&#x27;s mother, Lyudmila Mykolayivna Telehina (born Nelepova), was born on 11 August 1937 in Dnipropetrovsk. Her father, Volodymyr Abramovych Hrihyan, was born on 3 December 1937, also in Dnipropetrovsk. His Soviet passport gave his nationality as Latvian. His mother was Maria Yosypivna Hrihyan, born in 1909.

Ukrainian media have published speculation regarding the genealogy of Tymoshenko. Some of the hypotheses have no scientific evidence (for example, the hypothesis of the Armenian origin of the surname &quot;Grigyan&quot;);
 or could be designed to create negative publicity, although her Minister of Communications had in 2005 described her origins as half-Jewish, half-Armenian.

About her ethnicity, Yulia Tymoshenko herself has said: &quot;On my father&#x27;s side – everyone is Latvian for ten generations, and on my mother&#x27;s side – everyone is Ukrainian for ten generations.&quot; Tymoshenko&#x27;s parents were both born in Ukraine and are, therefore, Ukrainian as defined by the Law on Citizenship of Ukraine and by the Ukrainian Constitution.

Tymoshenko has said that, like most Soviet citizens, she spoke only Russian in her childhood (although she studied the Ukrainian language and literature at school for ten years, as did all schoolchildren in Soviet Ukraine). In January 2010, Tymoshenko stated that in Dnipropetrovsk she did not have to speak Ukrainian until she was 36 (i.e. before 1996). According to Tymoshenko, her braids are a family tradition.

In 1979, Yulia married businessman Oleksandr Tymoshenko (born 11 June 1960). The couple have a daughter – Yevhenia (Eugenia) Tymoshenko (born 20 February 1980) – a graduate of the London School of Economics (Bsc &quot;Government&quot;, Msc &quot;Russian and Post-Soviet Studies&quot;).

===Personal life===
Tymoshenko and her husband rent a house in Kyiv and own an apartment in Dnipro. Houses in Dnipro belong to their relatives. Tymoshenko has declared she never used and will never use or move into a state-owned summer house, in contrast with all former-Presidents and many high-ranking officials of Ukraine, who live in state-owned dachas in Koncha-Zaspa. According to Ukrainian media, Tymoshenko lives in an estate in Koncha-Zaspa, &quot;rented from a friend&quot;. In March 2014, Tymoshenko opened the door of her house to public activists and guided them around.

In her spare time, before she was imprisoned, Tymoshenko ran on a treadmill for exercise and listened to the music of Andrea Bocelli, Sarah Brightman, Anna Netrebko and Alessandro Safina. &quot;Ukrainska Pravda&quot; and &quot;Left Bank&quot; are her favourite news sources. Tymoshenko stated that she watched the Tunisian Revolution and Egyptian Revolution of 2011 &quot;with joy and admiration&quot;.

On 23 August 2020, Tymoshenko tested positive for COVID-19 and was hospitalized in serious condition, with one of her spokespeople saying that &quot;her condition is assessed as serious, her temperature is up to 39 [Celsius ()]&quot;. On 25 August, Tymoshenko was moved to the intensive care unit after her health worsened and prompted a transfer, a spokeswoman said, adding that she remains in &quot;serious condition.&quot; On 2 September, Tymoshenko announced through her Facebook account that &quot;Finally today, my crisis condition is behind. And although recovery is still a distant prospect, now there is an opportunity to return to normal life, step by step,&quot; adding &quot;that fighting off a serious disease for almost two weeks alters the perception of reality&quot;. On 11 September Tymoshenko&#x27;s press secretary Maryna Soroka announced that Tymoshenko had tested negative for COVID-19.

==Cultural and political image==

Tymoshenko is a voluble public performer. Her fiery rhetoric made her an icon of the Orange Revolution.

Tymoshenko&#x27;s critics have suggested that, as an oligarch, she gained her fortune improperly. Her former business partner, former Ukrainian prime minister Lazarenko, was convicted in the United States on charges of money laundering, corruption and fraud, the magnitude of which was in the billions of dollars. However, on 7 May 2004, Judge Martin Jenkins of the US District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the allegations of Tymoshenko&#x27;s involvement in Lazarenko&#x27;s murky business.

Her transition from oligarch to reformer was believed by many voters to be both genuine and effective. Discrepancies between her declared income and her luxurious designer outfits, have been pointed out in the Ukrainian tabloids.

When Tymoshenko joined the Yushchenko government, she did not speak Ukrainian. According to fellow Ukrainian politician Borys Tarasyuk, in 2002 Tymoshenko &quot;only spoke Russian even when I spoke to her in Ukrainian&quot;, but since then she has made the transition to speaking only Ukrainian.

During her second stint as prime-minister her ratings in opinion polls fell. In early 2008, in opinion polls for the 2009 Ukrainian presidential election, she stood at 30% but by late April 2009 that had shrunk to 15% According to a poll carried out between 29 January and 5 February 2009 by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, just over 43% of the Ukrainian voters believed Tymoshenko should leave her post, whereas just over 45% believed she should stay. According to an opinion poll carried out between 3 and 12 February 2009 by the &quot;Sofia&quot; Center for Social Studies, some 59.1% of those polled believed that the activities of (then) Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko were aimed at the defense of her own interests and that of her entourage, some 4.2% said her activities were aimed at the defense of interests of foreign states, and some 23.9% believed that Tymoshenko worked for the sake of national interests. 77.7% of the respondents were unsatisfied with the economic policy of the second Tymoshenko Government. Some 71.8% believed that this government was not able to lead the Ukrainian economy out of the 2008–09 Ukrainian financial crisis or even change the situation in Ukraine to better; 18.1% of respondents did think that the government could do that. Despite the neck-to-neck 2010 presidential race, many experts believed that Tymoshenko would win the vote due to her ability to &quot;hike her popularity just before the voting day&quot;. JP Morgan Securities Inc. experts said that Tymoshenko&#x27;s victory in presidential election would &quot;bring stability in 2010, with budget consolidation, better terms of crediting and higher influx of capital. As a result, the economy will have better prospects of growing in the second half of 2010 and 2011&quot;.

Tymoshenko has been ranked three times by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine among the most powerful women in the world. During her first term in 2005, she was ranked third (behind Condoleezza Rice and Wu Yi), in 2008 she was number 17 and in 2009 at number 47.
According to the Ukrainian magazine &quot;Focus&quot;, Tymoshenko placed first in an annual ranking of the most influential women in Ukraine in 2006–2010 (five years). During the Orange Revolution, some Western media publications dubbed her the &quot;Joan of Arc of the Revolution&quot;. In December 2011, Tymoshenko&#x27;s party BYuT-Batkivschyna nominated her for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin has stated (in November 2009) he found it comfortable to work with his (then) Ukrainian counterpart Yulia Tymoshenko and also praised her for strengthening Ukrainian sovereignty and building stable ties with Moscow and called the second Tymoshenko Government &quot;efficient and a force for stability&quot;. It has been suggested by Reuters that the Russian government, after seeing her opposition to Viktor Yushchenko, supported her since late 2008, although Putin denied it.

Former ally and President of Ukraine Yushchenko stated in November 2009, &quot;I am sure that every week spent by Yulia Tymoshenko in the post of prime minister leads the country to a catastrophe. Because of Yulia Tymoshenko, it is a crisis, a crisis in everything&quot;. Yushchenko has repeatedly accused his former ally turned rival Tymoshenko of acting in the interests of Russia, although she firmly denied the allegations. On 31 May 2010, Yushchenko stated that Tymoshenko was his &quot;worst mistake&quot;, &quot;The most serious mistake was to give the power to her twice&quot;. Expert in Ukrainian politics Dr. Taras Kuzio believes that he has always prioritized personal revenge against Tymoshenko over Ukraine&#x27;s national interests. In her turn, Tymoshenko has blamed President Viktor Yushchenko for obstructing the government-proposed anti-crisis measures and efforts to form a broad coalition to battle the crisis. &quot;The president is using flashy words today to deprive the nation, first of all its government, of the opportunity to counter the crisis, and to leave the nation without a government it logically needs&quot; she said. &quot;Viktor Yushchenko has no right to any criticism. He is the incumbent president. He only has the right to work and to serve Ukraine. He will have the right to criticize when he joins the opposition. Now he must work and answer for his moves&quot;.

Former Ukrainian Minister of Finance of Ukraine Viktor Pynzenyk has called Tymoshenko&#x27;s decisions &quot;normally guided by &#x27;adventurous populism&#x27;&quot;, which she saw as a tool to &quot;consolidate power in her own hands&quot; and believed Tymoshenko should have &quot;taken advantage of the opportunity presented by the 2008–2009 Ukrainian financial crisis to reform&quot;.

Party of Regions Deputy Head Borys Kolesnykov stated on 11 February 2010, &quot;Tymoshenko was the most effective politician during the entire period of Ukraine&#x27;s recent history&quot;. Former European High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy Javier Solana has called Tymoshenko &quot;a patriot regardless of the position in which you have found yourself&quot;. Yanukovych stated about Tymoshenko on 13 May 2010, &quot;She likes to create a sensation. We have grown used to this extravagant woman&quot;.

Vitaly Chepinoha has closely collaborated with Tymoshenko during various elections for more than a decade.

In some newspapers and television programs, Tymoshenko has been referred to as Lady Yu (Ледi Ю, Леди Ю).

<doc id="1246849" wikidata="Q6759902" url="?curid=1246849" title="Margaret Sloan-Hunter">
<text>Margaret Sloan-Hunter (May 31, 1947 – September 23, 2004) was a Black feminist, lesbian, civil rights advocate, and one of the early editors of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine.

==Early life==
Margaret Sloan-Hunter was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee on May 31, 1947. She grew up in Chicago.

==Career==
When Sloan-Hunter was 14, she joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), a group that worked on poverty and urban issues on behalf of the African-American community in Chicago. At the age of 17, she founded the Junior Catholic Inter-Racial Council, a mix of suburban and inner-city students who talked about and worked on racial problems. In 1966, Sloan-Hunter worked with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and in the &quot;Open Housing Marches&quot;.

Sloan-Hunter also became one of the first editors of &quot;Ms.&quot;, a magazine supporting the feminist movement. Along with editing, she traveled to speak on issues of sexism and racism throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.

Sloan-Hunter was a founding member of Lavender Women in 1971

Sloan-Hunter paired up with Jane Galvin-Lewis, a former writer of &quot;Ms.&quot;, to challenge racism and sexism as interlocking oppressions. To get involved further, Sloan-Hunter and Galvin-Lewis paired up with Florynce Kennedy in 1973 to speak on college campuses around the country. Their events became places for other black feminists to find each other and create support groups. This led Sloan-Hunter, Kennedy, and others to create the NBFO or National Black Feminist Organization. In the NBFO, many women worked to define the specific oppression black women face. Through the NBFO, Sloan-Hunter tackled some of the same race and feminist issues she grew up fighting for.

In 1975, she and her daughter Kathleen Sloan moved to Oakland, California, where they established the Women&#x27;s Foundation. She also helped organize the Berkeley Women&#x27;s Center and the Feminist School for Girls. Sloan-Hunter was an intersectionality activist, fighting for African American, feminist, and lesbian causes.

Sloan-Hunter published a book of poetry called &quot;Black &amp; Lavender&quot; in 1995. This was a series of thirty-eight poems written about Sloan-Hunter&#x27;s life.

==Education==
Margaret Sloan-Hunter won many awards for public speaking in high school. Margaret Sloan-Hunter went on to Chicago City College and Malcolm X College to major in speech. After this, she received a degree in Women&#x27;s Studies at Antioch University in San Francisco.

== Portrayal in the media ==
The political activism of Sloan-Hunter was featured in the television show Mrs. America which aired on Hulu in the spring of 2020.

==Death==
Margaret died in Oakland, California, when she was 57 years old. On September 23, 2004, her family confirmed she faced a prolonged illness.

<doc id="1246851" wikidata="Q314621" url="?curid=1246851" title="Derek Fisher">
<text>Derek Lamar Fisher (born August 9, 1974) is an American professional basketball coach and former player. Fisher played professionally in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 18 seasons, spending the majority of his career with the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he won five NBA championships. He also played for the Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, Oklahoma City Thunder, and Dallas Mavericks. He has also served as president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).

Fisher played college basketball for the Arkansas–Little Rock Trojans, earning the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year in 1996. Selected by the Lakers with the 24th pick in the 1996 NBA draft, he spent his first eight seasons with the franchise, winning three consecutive league championships (2000–2002) with teammates Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and coach Phil Jackson. After the 2003–04 NBA season, he signed as a free agent with the Golden State Warriors, later being traded to the Utah Jazz, whom he helped lead to the Western Conference finals. Due to his daughter&#x27;s health, he asked to be released from his contract in 2007. He rejoined the Lakers and won two more NBA titles with Bryant and Jackson.

In 2012, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, where he bought out his contract and was waived at his request. He then joined the Oklahoma City Thunder for the remainder of the season, playing for the 2012 NBA championship in his eighth Finals appearance. After signing with the 2012–13 Dallas Mavericks he played only nine games before being injured and asking to be released from his contract. He later rejoined the Oklahoma City Thunder for another late-season push. He re-signed with them in the off-season and played in a team-high 81 regular-season games for the team in 2013–14. The following season, he was hired as the head coach of the New York Knicks by Jackson, who had become the team&#x27;s president. He was fired in 2016, and has since been featured as a broadcast television analyst on Turner Sports&#x27; NBA programming. Fisher also joined Spectrum SportsNet for the 2016–17 NBA season to work as an in-studio analyst for the Los Angeles Lakers. On January 19, 2017, Fisher was announced as one of the analysts for Turner Sports&#x27; new Players Only programming slate. He was the head coach of the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) from 2019 to 2022.

At the time of his retirement, Fisher was first in career postseason games played, with 259, before being passed by LeBron James in Game 5 of the 2020 NBA Finals. As of the 2024–25 NBA regular season, James has played 287 playoff games, 28 more than Fisher, who remains in second place.

==Early life==
Derek Lamar Fisher was born on August 9, 1974, in Little Rock, Arkansas. He attended Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High School in Little Rock off John Barrow Road, where he was a letterman in basketball.

==College career==
He went on to attend the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR) for four years, with a major in communications. Fisher concluded his collegiate career at Arkansas-Little Rock second on the school&#x27;s all-time lists in points (1,393), assists (472), and steals (189). He averaged 12.4 points, 4.4 rebounds and 4.2 assists over 112 games and led the team in assists and steals every year. Fisher also set a school record for free throws made in a career (399) and ranked third among all-time UALR leaders in three-point field goals made (125). As a senior, he earned Sunbelt Conference Player of the Year honors after averaging 14.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game.

In 2005, Fisher pledged $700,000 to UALR towards the construction of its Jack Stephens Center auxiliary gym, since named in his honor, and the establishment of the Fisher Fellows Life Skills program, a mentoring series for UALR student-athletes.

==Professional career==

===Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004)===
Fisher was selected 24th overall in the 1996 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Lakers, and spent his first eight seasons with them. The Lakers also traded for rookie Kobe Bryant in this draft and the two rookies became great friends. Bryant went on to say that Fisher was his favorite teammate he ever played with.

Fisher made his NBA debut in an early-season game against the Phoenix Suns, tallying 12 points and five assists. Over the course of his rookie season, Fisher appeared in 80 games, averaging 3.9 points, 1.5 assists, and 1.2 rebounds. He was selected to the Schick Rookie Game during the All-Star Weekend in Cleveland and had 16 points and six assists. In the 1997–98 season, Fisher started 36 of 82 games, backing up Nick Van Exel. He started all 13 games in the playoffs and averaged 6 points per game as the Lakers advanced to the Western Conference finals before losing to the Utah Jazz in 4 games. In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, Fisher played in all 50 games and started in 21, mostly serving as a backup for veteran Derek Harper. Fisher would once again start in all of the Lakers&#x27; playoff games, posting averages of 9.8 points and 4.9 assists per game as the Lakers advanced past the Houston Rockets in the first round before falling to the San Antonio Spurs in the second round in 4 games.

Phil Jackson became the Lakers&#x27; head coach prior to the 1999–2000 season, and with him brought veteran point guard Ron Harper, who had started for three of Jackson&#x27;s Chicago Bulls championship teams. Jackson historically preferred big guards. Being both smaller and playing more like a traditional point guard, and not being much of a shooter, Fisher worked hard on his shooting during the offseason to increase his value to the new coach. He started in 22 of 78 games for the season, backing up both Harper and Kobe Bryant when injured. The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the Indiana Pacers in 6 games to win the 2000 NBA championship, Fisher&#x27;s first.

Due to a stress fracture in his right foot, Fisher missed the first 62 games of the 2000–01 season. During his absence, the Lakers were not winning as frequently as the previous season, which led to teammates Bryant and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal rekindling their feud over the team&#x27;s offense. Assistant coach Bill Bertka, however, believed a key factor in the team&#x27;s struggles was the team&#x27;s defense without Fisher. Fisher returned on March 13, 2001, upgrading the Lakers&#x27; defense, and he started the final 20 games of the season, averaging 11.5 points per game. Harper had been the regular starter, but he was sidelined since February 13 with injuries to both knees. The Lakers finished the regular season with an eight-game winning streak, and ended with 56 wins. Fisher started all of the Lakers 16 playoff games as they swept through the Western Conference, averaging 13.4 points per game and shooting a team-best 51 percent from beyond the three-point line. This included a career-high 28 points on 6 for 7 three-point shooting in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals against the San Antonio Spurs. In the Finals, the Lakers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in 5 games, bolstered by Fisher&#x27;s 18 points on 6 of 8 shooting from three-point range in game 5 to help clinch the Lakers&#x27; second straight title.

Injuries limited Fisher to start in 35 of 70 games in the 2001–02 season, but he continued to average double-figure scoring and shot over 40 percent from three-point range for the season. Fisher started all 19 playoff games, averaging 10.2 points per game as the Lakers advanced to the finals following a grueling 7 games series against the Sacramento Kings. In the finals, they defeated the New Jersey Nets to win their third straight title.

By the 2002–03 season, Fisher had established himself as the Lakers&#x27; primary point guard, starting in all 82 games. But the team was eliminated in the Western Conference semifinals by the eventual champion Spurs that spring, and this was followed by the signing of veteran point guard Gary Payton in the summer. As a result, Fisher was demoted back to the bench for the 2003–04 season. During NBA All-Star Weekend, he was a member of the Los Angeles team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.


One of Fisher&#x27;s finest playoff moments came on May 13, 2004, in Game 5 of the 2004 Western Conference semifinals between the Lakers and the defending champion San Antonio Spurs. The series was tied at 2 games apiece, and Game 5 was a closely contested affair. With 11 seconds remaining, Kobe Bryant hit a jump shot to put the Lakers up 72–71. Tim Duncan then made a fadeaway 18-footer over Shaquille O&#x27;Neal to give the Spurs a 73–72 lead with 0.4 seconds on the clock.

To devise strategies, three consecutive time-outs were called: the first by the Lakers, the second by San Antonio to set up the defense, and the last by the Lakers to re-set up the offense. When the game resumed, Gary Payton inbounded the ball to Fisher, who managed to catch, turn, and shoot the game-winning basket all in 0.4 seconds. Fisher sprinted off the court, as he later admitted he was uncertain he beat the buzzer and wanted to exit before the play could be reviewed. The Spurs immediately filed a dispute regarding the shot and after reviewing video footage of the play, the referees concluded that the ball indeed left Fisher&#x27;s hands before the clock expired. The &quot;0.4&quot; shot counted and the Lakers won the game by a score of 74–73.

The Lakers closed out the Spurs in Game 6. They proceeded to defeat the Minnesota Timberwolves to clinch the Western Conference championship, but were upset in the NBA Finals by the Detroit Pistons.

===Golden State Warriors (2004–2006)===
On July 15, 2004, Fisher signed a six-year, $37 million contract with the Golden State Warriors. Fisher&#x27;s two-season term with Golden State proved to be somewhat of a disappointment. While he was a reliable spot-up shooter, Fisher saw limited openings without a star player such as Bryant or O&#x27;Neal to command a double-team. The team as a whole continued to struggle mightily and languished near the bottom of the Western Conference standings.

Speedy Claxton started more games than Fisher in the 2004–05 season, and then newly acquired point guard Baron Davis was a starter the following season. Despite this, in 2005–06 season, Fisher averaged 13.3 points a game, the highest season scoring average of his career.

===Utah Jazz (2006–2007)===
Fisher was acquired by the Utah Jazz on July 12, 2006, in a trade that sent Keith McLeod, Andre Owens, and Devin Brown to the Golden State Warriors. He appeared in all 82 games of the 2006–07 season, averaging 10.1 points, 3.3 assists, and 1.01 steals while scoring in double figures 40 times in the 2006–07 season.

In November 2006, Fisher was voted President of the National Basketball Players Association, succeeding Antonio Davis. Fisher had previously served as vice president. He has also been the color commentator for the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA since July 1, 2008.

Several days before the Western Conference semifinals between the Jazz and the Golden State Warriors began, Fisher stated that one of his four children was ill, avoiding going into further detail other than to say he needed to be with his family and his playing status was uncertain.

Fisher had asked head coach Jerry Sloan to leave him on the active list for Game 2, but could not guarantee he would make it in time to play. But with permission from their doctors, he and his family flew from New York after his daughter&#x27;s surgery and landed in Salt Lake City with the game in progress. When they landed, Fisher found out starting point guard Deron Williams was in foul trouble and his backup Dee Brown had been injured. The Jazz had been using Andrei Kirilenko as a point guard and desperately needed Fisher. Given a police escort, Fisher arrived at the arena, suited up, and was given a standing ovation as he walked onto the floor. Not even given a chance to sit down, Fisher was put in the game in the middle of the third quarter. Late in the fourth, Fisher made a key defensive stop on Baron Davis that helped send the game into overtime. In the closing minutes, the Jazz held a three-point lead when Deron Williams found an open Fisher for a three-pointer that sealed the victory. After the game, a tearful Fisher was interviewed, where he revealed the situation involving his then-11-month-old daughter, Tatum. She had been diagnosed with retinoblastoma, a degenerative and rare form of eye cancer, which required an emergency three-hour surgery and chemotherapy at a New York hospital.

The Jazz eventually defeated the Warriors 4 games to 1, but fell to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference finals in five games. Fisher&#x27;s dramatic Game 2 entrance and performance against the Warriors was nominated for Best Moment in the 2007 ESPY Awards.

On July 2, 2007, Fisher asked the Jazz to release him from his contract so he could relocate to a team and city that would have the &quot;right combination&quot; of specialists that could help fight his daughter&#x27;s retinoblastoma. The Jazz honored his request.

===Return to the Lakers (2007–2012)===

After much speculation, on July 19, 2007, Fisher officially rejoined the Los Angeles Lakers by signing a three-year contract worth roughly $14 million. He had given up roughly $8 million over three years, as he was due about $22 million over the next three years in his prior contract with the Jazz. Jazz owner Larry Miller noted that &quot;[i]t did look funny&quot; that Fisher signed with the Lakers, but he did not believe Fisher or Lakers owner Jerry Buss would do anything underhanded. Jazz fans have taunted him, suspecting that he simply wanted to return to the Lakers.

When the 2007–08 season began, Fisher resumed his role as the Lakers&#x27; starting point guard. He contributed a solid season, shooting 40% from the three-point range and 88% from the free-throw line, the highest percentage of his career. He made a controversial defensive play in Game 4 of the Lakers-Spurs Western Conference finals, when late in the game Fisher jumped into Brent Barry&#x27;s path without a foul called, causing Barry to miss a potential game-winning shot. The Lakers eventually ousted the Spurs 4–1, but lost the NBA Finals to Boston.

Throughout the 2009 NBA playoffs, Fisher faced criticism about his age and lackluster defensive performances against younger, quicker opposing point guards. However, Fisher helped the Lakers win Game 4 over the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA Finals, hitting a three-pointer over Jameer Nelson with 4.6 seconds remaining to send the game into overtime, and a tie-breaking three-pointer with 31.3 seconds remaining in overtime to help send the Lakers to a 3–1 series lead and soon after, the franchise&#x27;s 15th NBA title. Bill Plaschke of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described these shots by stating, &quot;After his two jaw-flooring three-pointers led the Lakers to a 99–91 overtime victory against the Orlando Magic in Game 4 of the NBA Finals, you&#x27;ll now officially be seeing him forever.&quot; Fisher&#x27;s 11.0 points per game, 50% shooting average, and 44% three-point percentage over the course of the Finals were an improvement over his regular-season numbers and a departure from his post-season struggles to that point. He had shot 23.5% from behind the three-point line and 35.6% from the field in the three prior playoff series. This was Fisher&#x27;s fourth NBA championship.
On September 8, 2009, Fisher released a book, &quot;Character Driven: Life, Lessons, and Basketball&quot;. He is credited as the author of the book with Gary Brozek contributing. On February 3, 2010, Fisher made the 1,000th 3-pointer of his career against the Charlotte Bobcats. On February 10, 2010, Fisher played his 1,000th career game against his former team, the Utah Jazz, beating Kobe Bryant to the milestone by one game. On February 23, 2010, Fisher made the 9,000th point of his NBA career against the Memphis Grizzlies.

On June 8, 2010, in Game 3 of the NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics, Fisher played a pivotal role down the stretch to help the Lakers take a 2–1 series lead. In the 4th quarter, he scored 11 of his 16 points, including a 3-point-play lay-up that helped the Lakers wrap up a 91–84 road victory. In Game 7, the Lakers came all the way back from a 13-point third-quarter deficit when Fisher hit a critical 3-pointer to tie the game with 6:11 remaining. The Lakers ultimately defeated the Celtics 83–79, and Fisher went on to win his fifth NBA championship.

After his fifth championship win, Fisher became a free agent, fielding offers from several teams, including the Miami Heat. However, on July 12, 2010, he agreed to a three-year, $10.5 million deal with a player option in the third year to continue with the Lakers. Though their contract offer was not the most lucrative, Fisher considered it &quot;the most valuable&quot; option.

===Houston Rockets (2012)===
On March 15, 2012, Fisher was traded along with a 2012 first-round draft pick to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill. The Lakers had decided to go younger, acquiring point guard Ramon Sessions earlier in the day. On March 19, he was waived by the Rockets without ever playing for them after he negotiated a contract buyout. After clearing waivers, he was eligible to sign with any team except the Lakers.

===Oklahoma City Thunder (2012)===
On March 21, 2012, after clearing the waivers at 6 pm Eastern time, Fisher signed a contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder for the remainder of the 2011–12 season. The Thunder organization called a pre-game press conference prior to its 7pm game to formally announce the signing. He chose jersey number 37, his age at the time, because his usual No. 2 was taken by Thabo Sefolosha. He made his debut on that night against the Los Angeles Clippers, scoring 5 points. The Thunder defeated the Spurs in the Western Conference finals and advanced to the 2012 NBA Finals, Fisher&#x27;s eighth career appearance there. The Thunder would go on to lose the series in 5 games to the Miami Heat.

===Dallas Mavericks (2012)===

On November 29, 2012, Fisher signed with the Dallas Mavericks. The team was in need of a point guard after a finger injury sidelined struggling starter Darren Collison. He wore No. 6, signifying his quest for a sixth championship, as his usual No. 2—last worn in Dallas by Jason Kidd—was unavailable. Fisher started in his first game with the Mavericks and Collison came off the bench in a 92–77 win over Detroit.

On December 20, Fisher injured the patellar tendon of his right knee, requiring an estimated two-week recovery time. Two days later, the Mavericks granted his request to be released. He said the move was driven by the injury and a desire to be close to his family. In nine games with Dallas, the team went 5–4, and he averaged 8.6 points and 3.6 assists in just over 25 minutes per game.

===Return to the Thunder (2013–2014)===
On February 25, 2013, Fisher re-signed with Oklahoma City for the remainder of the 2012–13 season. He filled the Thunder&#x27;s opening for a third point guard after Eric Maynor had been traded. After being away from basketball, Fisher reflected on his career and decided to pursue the opportunity with the Thunder. He did not contact Dallas before signing with the championship contenders, which upset Mavericks officials. Fisher chose to wear No. 6 with Oklahoma City after wearing No. 37 the previous season.

On July 24, 2013, Fisher re-signed with the Thunder for the 2013–14 season. He played in 81 regular-season games and all 19 playoff games, and was able to help the team reach the Western Conference finals before falling to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in six games.

==Coaching career==

===New York Knicks (2014–2016)===
On June 10, 2014, Fisher was hired by the New York Knicks to be the team&#x27;s head coach, signing a five-year, $25 million deal. Fisher said his relationship with Jackson, who had become the president of the Knicks, was a major factor in his decision to join the team. Fisher planned for the Knicks to run the triangle offense, which he learned while with the Lakers under Jackson. During the offseason, he helped the Knicks re-recruit and re-sign free agent Carmelo Anthony, whom Fisher believed could adapt to the new offense. On October 29, Fisher made his coaching debut where the team lost their 2014–15 season opener to the Chicago Bulls 104–80. On October 30, Fisher won his first game as a head coach after the Knicks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 95–90. The Knicks ended the season with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.

Bolstered by first-round draft pick Kristaps Porziņģis, New York began 2015–16 as playoff contenders with a 22–22 record. However, Fisher was fired on February 8, 2016, after the Knicks lost nine of their next 10 and fell to a 23–31 record. Over one-and-a-half seasons with the Knicks, he compiled an overall record of 40–96 (.294).

===Los Angeles Sparks (2019–2022)===
On December 5, 2018, Fisher was named the head coach of the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA. The team got its first win of the 2019 season on June 1, 2019, defeating the Connecticut Sun 77–70, giving Fisher his first win as a WNBA head coach. On September 4, 2019, Fisher became the ninth WNBA head coach to achieve 20 wins as a first year as a WNBA head coach, as the team defeat the Atlanta Dream 70–60. The team would finish 22–12 under Fisher&#x27;s first season, making the WNBA playoffs as the third seed.

Under the playoff format, the team would bypass the first round and face off against the Seattle Storm in a single-elimination game, beating the Storm 92–69 to advance the WNBA semi-finals. In the third semifinal game against the Connecticut Sun, Fisher came up with a strategy that SB Nation called bizarre, benching his three starting stars, Candace Parker, Nneka Ogwumike, and Chelsea Gray, for the fourth quarter, after which the Sparks were eliminated.

In his second season with the Sparks, Fisher led the team to a 15–7 record in 22 games in a shortened WNBA season, making the WNBA playoffs as the third seed. The team would bypass the first round and face off against the Connecticut Sun in a single-elimination game, but the Sparks would be eliminated, losing 73–59.

On December 22, 2020, the Sparks appointed Fisher to be the general manager. in the 2021 WNBA draft he selected No. 7 pick: Jasmine Walker (F, Alabama)
No. 10 pick: Stephanie Watts (G, North Carolina)
No. 22 pick: Arella Guirantes (G, Rutgers)
No. 28 pick: Ivana Raca (F, Wake Forest)
No. 34 pick: Aina Ayuso (G, Spain)
On June 7, 2022, the Sparks and Fisher parted ways as head coach and general manager after the Sparks started the year off 5–7 after bringing in Liz Cambage. Fisher went 54–46 as head coach during his Sparks tenure. He was 1–4 in the playoffs.

===Crespi Carmelite High School - Encino, California (2023)===

On August 7, 2023, Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino, California announced that Fisher would be their new head basketball coach.

== Television analyst ==
Fisher made guest appearances on television broadcasts throughout his career, and he began working professionally as a broadcaster in the spring of 2016. Multiple times during the NBA season, Fisher appeared as an analyst on TNT&#x27;s &quot;Inside the NBA&quot;, and NBA TV. At the start of the 2016–17 NBA season, Fisher joined Spectrum SportsNet as an in-studio analyst for the Los Angeles Lakers.

==Player profile==

Fisher had a long and successful career in the NBA, especially with the Lakers. Fisher was perhaps best known for his leadership, toughness, and clutch playmaking ability. He averaged 8.3 points per game for his career and never topped more than 13.3 points during a regular season. However, he did shoot at least 40% from the three-point line four times and 90% from the free-throw line three times in the regular season throughout his career.

At the time of his retirement as a player after the 2013–14 season, Fisher held NBA career playoff records for games played (259) and games won (161), both broken by LeBron James in 2020. Fisher also held the record for career playoff series won (40), surpassed by James in 2023. Fisher was also ranked third in career three-point field goals in the NBA Finals.

Phil Jackson said that Fisher was &quot;definitely the spokesman for [the Lakers] as far as leadership goes&quot;, while Bryant called him his favorite teammate.

In a 2011 poll of NBA players by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Fisher received the fourth-most votes, six percent, for being the best flopper in the game. &quot;Fish takes the contact. He does draw and sell offensive fouls,&quot; Jackson said. &quot;We&#x27;re happy he does what he does.&quot;

==Players union==
Fisher was a player representative for the NBPA before becoming a member of the union&#x27;s executive committee. He was elected the union&#x27;s president in 2006. He supported the NBA&#x27;s referees during their lockout in 2009. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Fisher took a more active role than his predecessors, and he shared the lead with Billy Hunter, the union&#x27;s full-time executive director. Jason Whitlock of &quot;Foxsports.com&quot; wrote that Fisher was privately working with Stern on a deal to accept a lower percentage of revenues for the players and that Hunter confronted Fisher about the issue. In a letter to the players, Fisher called the reports questioning his loyalty &quot;absurd&quot; and demanded &quot;a retraction for the libelous and defamatory stories&quot; through his attorneys. Hunter said, &quot;My relationship with Derek is very good. There was no confrontation.&quot;

Hunter later persuaded the union&#x27;s executive committee to vote to request Fisher&#x27;s resignation. Fisher did not resign and pushed for an outside investigation of the union. Hunter&#x27;s leadership was criticized in the findings. During their annual meeting over the All-Star break in 2013, the union unanimously voted Hunter out as executive director. Fisher was re-elected as president; he was not on an NBA roster at the time, but remained eligible due to his stint earlier in the season with Dallas. Fisher&#x27;s term as president expired in summer 2013.

In May 2013, Hunter sued Fisher and Jamie Wior, Fisher&#x27;s publicist and business partner, seeking compensation and punitive damages. The suit claimed that Fisher had a secret deal with NBA owners during the lockout. In January 2014, a judge dismissed all of Hunter&#x27;s claims against Wior and Fisher, and Hunter dropped his subsequent appeal in May.

==Personal life==

Fisher is the younger brother of former NBA player Duane Washington, who is ten years Fisher&#x27;s senior. Fisher is a Christian who has spoken about his faith and the ability he believes it gives him to play basketball. Fisher&#x27;s nickname is D-Fish.

He married his wife, Candace, on February 19, 2005, and has four children: Tatum and Drew (twins), Marshall and Chloe. On March 18, 2015, Fisher filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences; the divorce was finalized in May 2016.

He is currently the head basketball coach at Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino, CA.

In 2009, Fisher had a temporary restraining order placed on a 40-year-old female stalker who had been victimizing him since 2001. She had insisted she and Fisher were married, and had even changed her surname to match his. He had the order extended by three years, expiring in May 2012.

Fisher competed on season 25 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with professional dancer Sharna Burgess. They were the third couple to be eliminated.

In October 2015, Fisher was involved in a physical altercation with former teammate Matt Barnes at a party in the home of Barnes&#x27; ex-wife, Gloria Govan. Fisher and Govan became engaged in April 2018 and they married on July 17, 2021, at Cielo Farms in Malibu, California.

Fisher was arrested on suspicion of DUI on June 4, 2017, after a car crash in Los Angeles in which his vehicle overturned. Govan, who was a passenger, was uninjured. He later pleaded no contest in the case.

<text>Mykola Olehovych &quot;Nikolai&quot; Zherdev (; born November 5, 1984) is a Ukrainian-Russian professional ice hockey right winger who is currently playing for the Alleghe Hockey of the Italian Hockey League.

He previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Columbus Blue Jackets, New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Born in Kyiv, Ukraine, Zherdev began playing hockey at the age of four. He began his training with the Sokil Kyiv junior hockey affiliate. Due to complications with organizing a team for his age group, he was pushed to play a year ahead with the 1983 born players; a group which included fellow future Ukrainian NHLer Anton Babchuk. Zherdev played in the 1998 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with his youth team from Kyiv. While playing in the tournament, Zherdev&#x27;s team found itself competing against a team from Elektrostal, Russia. The rival team&#x27;s coach, Ravil Iskhakov, took note of both Zherdev and Babchuk, and invited the pair to further their development with the Elemash Elektrostal hockey club of the Russian Major League, to which they accepted together. The desire to play at a higher level came at a price: his nationality. In order to play in Russia, he would be forced to apply for Russian citizenship.

===CSKA Moscow===
As his game progressed and professional teams began to take notice, Elektrostal received offers from the likes of Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, Ak Bars Kazan, and CSKA Moscow for Zherdev&#x27;s services. He would accept an invitation for Elektrostal to loan him to the latter team, CSKA, citing a desire to train under esteemed coach Viktor Tikhonov.

Zherdev spent the entire 2002–03 season with CSKA. He left for the NHL halfway through the 2003–04 season. He would, however, return to the Russian club during the 2004–05 NHL lockout.

===Columbus Blue Jackets===
Zherdev was drafted by Columbus in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft with the fourth overall pick. At the time, Columbus general manager Doug MacLean stated that the team had Zherdev ranked number one on their draft list.
The 2005–06 NHL season was a breakout year for Zherdev, who scored 27 goals and notched 27 assists in 73 games. He was the Blue Jackets&#x27; most potent offensive threat while Rick Nash recuperated from injury, and played most of the season on the team&#x27;s first line.

The 2006–07 NHL season was a low point for Zherdev, as he struggled to score consistently and frequently clashed with the Jackets&#x27; coaching staff, leading to repeated rumors that he might be traded before the 2007–08 NHL season began. In response, Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson and then-coach Ken Hitchcock met Zherdev in a &quot;clean-the-slate&quot; meeting. Following the meeting, Zherdev rediscovered success on the ice.

====Contract dispute====
Contract negotiations with Blue Jackets management following the 2005–06 season became acrimonious. Zherdev threatened to remain in Russia for the season unless his demands were met, while Columbus insisted that Zherdev&#x27;s salary demands were not commensurate with his accomplishments. On September 28, 2006, the parties finally agreed to a $7.5 million, three-year contract.

===New York Rangers===

On July 2, 2008, Zherdev was traded by the Blue Jackets along with Dan Fritsche to the New York Rangers for defencemen Fedor Tyutin and Christian Bäckman. In his first season with the Rangers, Zherdev tied for the team lead in points with Scott Gomez, scoring 58 points.

As a restricted free agent, Zherdev was tendered a qualifying offer of $3.25 million by the Rangers before the start of the 2009 free agency period so the team could retain his rights as the two sides negotiate. Zherdev was awarded $3.9 million (USD) in arbitration, however, the New York Rangers chose to let Zherdev go.

===KHL===
The aforementioned walkaway made Zherdev an unrestricted free agent. Zherdev signed on September 15, 2009, a one-year contract for Atlant Moscow Oblast.

===NHL return===
On July 9, 2010, Zherdev signed a one-year deal for $2 million with the Philadelphia Flyers, setting up his return to the NHL. This NHL stint would last 56 games through one season as Zherdev did not garner the trust of Flyers head coach Peter Laviolette due to what the coach saw as lackadaisical effort and selfish play. For the majority of the season, Zherdev received limited ice time while playing the fourth line with very offensively limited linemates and rarely saw any power play time. Despite the lack of opportunities, Zherdev would manage a productive 16 goals, which included his 100th NHL goal. After the season the Flyers did not attempt to sign him to a contract extension.

===Back to KHL===
Following the 2010–11 season, Zherdev returned to Atlant Moscow Oblast. In the 2012–13, he was announced as the team Captain. He played in 39 games registering an impressive 37 points before he was traded to Ak Bars Kazan on January 15, 2013, to complete the season.





After signing a one-year deal with HC Lev Praha in July 2013, Zherdev celebrated at the Barvikha Luxury Village hotel in Moscow where things turned violent, according to a Russian news report. Zherdev allegedly initiated a bar brawl at the hotel before crashing his Bentley Continental GT, which was later vandalized by locals who were outraged with his behaviour and scratched the words &quot;scum&quot;, &quot;bastard&quot;, and others into the vehicle&#x27;s paint with nails. Damage to the vehicle was allegedly valued at $30,000. Barvikha Luxury Village hotel staff also claimed Zherdev spent nights there with various women, prompting his wife, Eugenia, to file for divorce. Zherdev also lost his passport as a result of the incident, meaning that he could not fly to his new team&#x27;s training camp in Finland.

He was released from his contract with Lev and on September 24, 2013, he was signed to a one-year contract with HC Spartak Moscow. After failing to score a goal in 16 games with the club, he was released by the team in mid-November before accepting a short-term deal with HC Severstal.

On July 14, 2014, Zherdev continued his journeyman career, in agreeing to a one-year contract with HC Dynamo Moscow for the 2014–15 season.

In August 2017, Zherdev signed a one-year contract with Russian KHL team Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk. He played two games for Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk before leaving the team for Latvian KHL team Dinamo Riga. In January 2018, the contract was terminated by mutual agreement.

Zherdev did not play during the 2018–19 season. In the 2019–20 season, Zherdev played for HC Ryazan of the VHL. In October 2019, the contract was terminated by mutual agreement. Zherdev did not play during the 2020–21 season.

For the 2021–22 season, Zherdev signed a one-year contract with the Bratislava Capitals of the ICE Hockey League. After the successive deaths of a Bratislava player Boris Sádecký and the team&#x27;s vice president, the club dissolved and did not play for the remainder of the season. Zherdev then moved to Merano of the Alps Hockey League; his departure from the team was announced in July 2022. Zherdev began the 2022–23 season playing for Yunost Minsk of the Belarusian Extraleague. In October 2022, Zherdev moved to Dinamo-Molodechno, also of the Belarusian Extraleague. Dinamo-Molodechno terminated his contract in March 2023. For the 2023–24 season, Zherdev signed to Alleghe Hockey of the Italian Hockey League.

==International play==
Nikolai Zherdev represented Russia at the 2002 U-18 World Junior Championships, helping that country to a silver medal. He finished the tournament with 6 goals, 5 assists, 11 points in 8 games (third best on his team, behind only Alexander Ovechkin and Alexander Semin).

Zherdev also played at the 2003 U-20 World Junior Championships, registering only one assist in six games, playing a minor role in Russia&#x27;s quest for the gold medal.

He was named captain of Team Russia for the 2004 World Juniors, but did not play after departing for the NHL.

==Personal life==
Zherdev is fluent in Ukrainian and Russian, and can speak limited English. In 2023 got married with Maria Kirilenko In November 2024 the couple got a daughter.

<text>The Snow-Image, and Other Twice-Told Tales is a collection of short stories by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Released in late 1851 with a copyright of 1852, it is the final collection of tales by Hawthorne published in his lifetime.

==Background==
After publishing his collection &quot;Mosses from an Old Manse&quot; in 1846, Hawthorne mostly turned away from the short tales that had marked the majority of his career to that point. In the interim period leading up to the collection &quot;The Snow-Image, and Other Twice-Told Tales&quot;, he wrote only four new stories: &quot;Main-street&quot;, &quot;Feathertop&quot;, &quot;The Snow-Image&quot;, and &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;. All but &quot;Feathertop&quot; would be included in the new collection.

In his preface to the collection, Hawthorne playfully noted that his confessional tone in writing about himself should not be trusted: &quot;[T]hese things hide the man instead of displaying him&quot;, he wrote, and suggested that readers seeking &quot;essential traits&quot; of the author &quot;must make quite another kind of inquest&quot;, specifically that &quot;you must look through the whole range of his fictitious characters, good and evil&quot;.

==Publication history==

Hawthorne was ending his brief stay in Lenox, Massachusetts, as &quot;The Snow-Image, and Other Twice Told Tales&quot; was being prepared. During his time there, Hawthorne had befriended Herman Melville, who had just published &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; with a dedication to Hawthorne as Hawthorne was preparing the preface for his new book. Publisher James T. Fields compiled the collection of 15 tales and sketches and published it in book form in December 1851. Commercially, it was Hawthorne&#x27;s least popular book.

Hawthorne dedicated the collection to his friend Horatio Bridge, who had subsidized his first collection years earlier. In his dedicatory letter, Hawthorne directly addressed Bridge: &quot;If anybody is responsible for my being at this day an author, it is yourself.&quot; Hawthorne also fondly recalled the time he shared with Bridge as students at Bowdoin College:
Bridge believed that Hawthorne &quot;overvalued&quot; his friendship but after Hawthorne&#x27;s death his widow Sophia Hawthorne assured him that the admiration was deserved: &quot;He had the utmost reliance upon you, and reposed upon it with infinite satisfaction. It seems to me not a small merit to have inspired in him such respect, love and trust as he invariably expressed for you... he had no more thorough friend than you in the world, and I know he thought so.&quot;

<text>Colin Charvis (born 27 December 1972) is a former professional rugby union player. A back row forward, Charvis was equally adept as a flanker or at number 8. Born in Sutton Coldfield, England, he captained the Wales national team from 2002 to 2004, and also played for the British &amp; Irish Lions on their tour of Australia in 2001.

Charvis became the world record try scorer for a forward in test match rugby with his 22nd international try on 24 November 2007 in a match against South Africa at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. In 2011, he was overtaken by Takashi Kikutani of Japan on the list of leading rugby union test try scorers.

==Early life==
Charvis was born in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, on 27 December 1972 to Lloyd and Lynne Charvis, and grew up in the nearby town of Aldridge. Charvis is of Jamaican heritage through his father. After playing football in his early years, Charvis began playing rugby at the age of 11 when he started attending Queen Mary&#x27;s Grammar School in Walsall. At age 18, he began studying at the Polytechnic of Central London, where he was coached by former London Welsh RFC player Glan Richards, who convinced Charvis to join the club. He stayed at London Welsh until 1995, when he moved to Swansea RFC, under the management of Mike Ruddock.

==Club career==
Charvis played for Swansea for eight seasons, making a total of 168 appearances and scoring 62 tries. In March 2003, the club went into administration, and Charvis was offered a redundancy package on 21 March. He was released the following week amid hopes for a contract offer from the newly founded Neath–Swansea regional team, as well as the Gwent team coached by Mike Ruddock, who had brought Charvis to Swansea.

After Wales&#x27;s elimination from the World Cup, having not received an acceptable offer from any of the five new Welsh regional sides, Charvis signed for French second-tier side Tarbes on a contract that would take him through to the end of the 2003–04 season, when he was expected to return to Wales; During the season, he expressed his intent to continue playing for Wales; however, although he was part of the squad for the 2004 Six Nations Championship, his desire to continue his international career proved a stumbling block, and by the end of the tournament in March 2004, initial talks with three of the regions had reached an impasse.

Despite interest from at least three unnamed, top-flight French sides, Charvis signed for Newcastle Falcons in England in June 2004. He missed three months of the 2004–05 season after suffering a broken foot in January 2005, but returned for the last three games of the season. After captaining the team in those matches, he was named as Newcastle&#x27;s full-time captain for the 2005–06 season, taking over from co-captains Jonny Wilkinson and Ian Peel. With his contract due to expire at the end of the season, talks began over a new deal but by May 2006, rumours surfaced that negotiations had broken down.

No deal was forthcoming, and on 26 May 2006, it was announced that Charvis would be leaving Newcastle. After a move to the Newport Gwent Dragons fell through over the summer, Charvis was reportedly considering retirement; however, he did ultimately sign for the Dragons on a one-year deal. He made his debut for the club in a pre-season friendly against the Cornish Pirates, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 20–6 victory. Coach Paul Turner said after the game that he expected Charvis would play at least 15 games for the Dragons that season. He ended up playing 26 times, mostly at flanker but also at number 8, and scored three tries. Charvis particularly shone in the European Challenge Cup, scoring a try in the 66–10 win at home and the 39–29 win away to the București Wolves in December 2006. The Dragons went on to reach the semi-finals of the competition, but Charvis missed the match against Clermont due to injury and the Dragons lost 46–29. He scored his third try of the season in the Dragons&#x27; penultimate league match, a 23–0 win at home to Connacht.

Due to his involvement with Wales at the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Charvis missed the first five games of the Dragons&#x27; season in 2007–08, returning to action in the 19–13 away win over Edinburgh on 12 October 2007. He again scored back-to-back European tries in December 2007, crossing in the 35–33 away win at Benetton Treviso and 24–22 loss in the return game at Rodney Parade. That win over Benetton proved to be the Dragons&#x27; only one of the Heineken Cup campaign; they lost 25–0 in their final pool game against Perpignan on 19 January 2008, and Charvis suffered an injury that ruled him out for the next 10 weeks. He returned to play in five of the last six games of the season, scoring a try in an 18–10 win at home to the Ospreys in the penultimate match that secured Heineken Cup qualification; he was named man of the match in that game, as well as the final-day win at home to Leinster.

Charvis signed a new one-year contract with the Dragons in July 2008 naming him as the team&#x27;s contact and defence coach, while also reducing his playing commitments. He made his first appearance of the season off the bench in a 25–14 win over former club Newcastle in the Anglo-Welsh Cup on 3 October 2008, being named man of the match for his half-hour cameo. He was on the scoresheet the following week with a try in a 32–22 win over Glasgow Warriors. That proved to be his final try in professional rugby, as he played in seven of the Dragons&#x27; next eleven matches without scoring, although his chip kick did provide the assist for Jason Tovey&#x27;s decisive try in a 30–24 win over the Ospreys on 19 December; his final appearance for the Dragons came on 18 January 2009 in a 15–12 loss at home to Bath in the Heineken Cup. He also made an appearance for the Barbarians in a match to mark the official opening of the Scarlets&#x27; new stadium, Parc y Scarlets, on 31 January. At the end of the season, after undergoing knee surgery, Charvis went full-time with his coaching duties at the Dragons, with a focus on defence. His remit was expanded to coaching the forwards group in December 2009, after fellow coach Leigh Jones took a job in Hong Kong. He left the Dragons in late September 2010, but no reason was given for his departure.

==International career==
Charvis won his first cap for Wales on 1 December 1996, when he came on as a substitute in a 28–16 loss to Australia at Cardiff Arms Park. He scored his first tries two years later, scoring twice in a 43–30 win over Argentina at Stradey Park in Llanelli on 21 November 1998. He followed this up with another try in a 34–33 win over France at the Stade de France in the 1999 Five Nations Championship.

In 2000, Charvis was implicated in Grannygate as he had been first capped for Wales in 1996 while apparently ineligible. However, by the time the scandal broke he had completed the required three-year residency period and no further action was taken. In 2015, a DNA testing project suggested that Charvis had genuine Welsh ancestry that he did not know about.

In 2001, Charvis was selected by the British &amp; Irish Lions for their tour of Australia; he scored two tries in their 83–6 win over a Queensland President&#x27;s XV in the second match of the tour, followed by another in a game against New South Wales Country Districts in the final game before the first test. He was named as a substitute for the first and third tests, coming on for Wales teammate Scott Quinnell both times.

In October 2004, Charvis was at the centre of a selection row between Wales and the Newcastle Falcons, whose coach Rob Andrew believed Charvis would not have to be released for Wales&#x27; match against South Africa on 6 November; however, it was later clarified that Wales players based in England would have to be released by Premiership clubs as their fixture that weekend had been arranged in April 2004, unlike Scotland, whose game against Australia the same day had not been arranged until late August.

Charvis was named in Gareth Jenkins&#x27; 41-man preliminary summer training squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. He made the final 30-man squad in August after playing in the Test against England and made substitute appearances in both summer matches against Argentina and France. Charvis made a try-scoring substitute appearance in Wales&#x27;s opening Pool B match against Canada, and made the starting line-ups for the remaining pool clashes with Australia, Japan and Fiji.

In November 2007, Wales caretaker coach Nigel Davies included Charvis in his starting line-up for the inaugural Prince William Cup match with South Africa. Despite the 34–12 defeat to the reigning world champions, Charvis scored his 22nd try for his country, making him the leading try scorer among all Welsh forwards (as of 2021). He is one of only four forwards to score over 100 international points (John Eales, Carlo Checchinato and Takashi Kikutani are the others). He was the second most capped player for Wales and the most capped forward with 94 caps until overtaken by Martyn Williams on 13 March 2010. He also featured in the 1999 Rugby World Cup and captained Wales in the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia.

=== International tries ===
==Post-professional career==
After retiring, Charvis opened a carpet and flooring shop in Swansea. In 2013, the shop was located on Oystermouth Road in Swansea, but in 2016, it was moved to Horizon Park, Llansamlet.

In 2018, commemorating Black History Month in the United Kingdom, Charvis was included on a list of 100 &quot;Brilliant, Black and Welsh&quot; people.

In 2023, Charvis was named as one of 295 former rugby players bringing a lawsuit against the sport&#x27;s governing bodies over brain injuries sustained while playing.

<doc id="1246861" wikidata="Q1854869" url="?curid=1246861" title="2003 NHL entry draft">
<text>The 2003 NHL entry draft was the 41st NHL entry draft. It was held at the Gaylord Entertainment Center in Nashville, Tennessee on June 21 and 22, 2003.

Goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury was selected first overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins. This was only the third time a goaltender was selected first overall in the draft, after Michel Plasse in 1968 and Rick DiPietro in 2000. Eric Staal was selected second, by the Carolina Hurricanes, and Nathan Horton was the third selection, by the Florida Panthers.

Many analysts rate this draft as having one of the most talented groups of players, some say even better than the 1979 NHL draft. Every first-round pick went on to play in a regular season NHL game. Among those, two played only a handful of games: Hugh Jessiman (2 games) and Shawn Belle (20). All other first round picks had much more substantial NHL careers: the third-fewest games was Marc-Antoine Pouliot with 192. Fleury, Staal, Horton, Nikolay Zherdev, and Patrice Bergeron all became NHL regulars immediately after they were drafted. Milan Michalek was expected to do the same, and was selected for the San Jose Sharks&#x27; NHL roster after training camp, but suffered a serious knee injury that ruled him out for the season. All of the top ten selections played at least nine games in the NHL in the 2005–06 season. Calgary Flames&#x27; first round selection Dion Phaneuf scored 20 goals in his rookie campaign, becoming the third defenceman to do so, after Brian Leetch and Barry Beck. Mike Richards and Jeff Carter (Flyers), Zach Parise (Devils), Ryan Getzlaf (Ducks), and Eric Staal (Hurricanes) all led their teams in scoring in the 2007–08 regular season, and Dustin Brown (Kings) went on to break the record for most Stanley Cups won by an American team captain (two, in 2012 and 2014).

Later rounds of the draft also featured more players than usual that went on to have substantial NHL careers. These included Shea Weber (49th overall pick), Corey Crawford (52nd), David Backes (62nd), Jimmy Howard (64th), Clarke MacArthur (74th), Jan Hejda (106th), Paul Bissonnette (121st), Kyle Quincey (132nd), Lee Stempniak (148th), Nigel Dawes (149th), Marc Methot (168th), Nate Thompson (183rd), Drew Miller (186th), Joe Pavelski (205th), Kyle Brodziak (214th), Tobias Enstrom (239th), Dustin Byfuglien (245th), Shane O&#x27;Brien (250th), Matt Moulson (263rd), Jaroslav Halak (271st), David Jones (288th), and Brian Elliott (291st).

As of 2024, the remaining active players in the NHL from this draft are Corey Perry, Brent Burns, Ryan Suter, and Marc-Andre Fleury.

==Draft day trades==
The following trades were made on the day of the draft:
* The St. Louis Blues traded Cory Stillman to the Tampa Bay Lightning for the 62nd pick (David Backes).
* The New Jersey Devils traded Mike Danton and the 101st pick (Konstantin Zakharov) to the St. Louis Blues for the 93rd pick (Ivan Khomutov).
* The Chicago Blackhawks traded Andrei Nikolishin to the Colorado Avalanche for the 120th pick (Mitch Maunu)
* The St. Louis Blues traded Tyson Nash to the Phoenix Coyotes for the 148th pick (Lee Stempniak)

<doc id="1246864" wikidata="Q5163660" url="?curid=1246864" title="Constant linear velocity">
<text>In optical storage, constant linear velocity (CLV) is a qualifier for the rated speed of an optical disc drive, and may also be applied to the writing speed of recordable discs. CLV implies that the angular velocity (i.e. rpm) varies during an operation, as contrasted with CAV modes. 

If the data density is the same everywhere on the disc, as is the case with CD and DVD and Blu-ray discs, the linear velocity directly correlates with the transfer rate (read speed or write speed), meaning an increase in linear velocity also increases the amount of data read from the disc in the same time, regardless of whether the laser is reading from or writing to the inner edge or the outer edge of the data area. At any disc rotation speed (angular velocity), the linear velocity is higher at the outer edge than at the inner edge of the disc, given that the outer edge travels a longer distance.

The concept of constant linear velocity was patented in 1886 by phonograph pioneers Chichester Bell and Charles Tainter.

== History ==
LaserDiscs, the first consumer optical discs, used constant linear velocity to double playback time (CLV / &quot;extended play&quot; discs can hold 1 hour per side; CAV / &quot;standard play&quot; discs can only hold 30 minutes). As the motor&#x27;s speed decreases from 1,800 to 600 rpm when the read head moves away from the center (which is the start of the recording), the disc moves past the read head at a constant speed.

Later optical formats such as the audio CD also employ CLV to maintain both a constant data rate and a constant bit density. Their rotation gradually decreases from 495 to 212 rpm to keep the disc moving past the read laser at (assuming 1:1 playback speed and Red Book encoding).

To accommodate the higher data transfer rates and random access requirements of modern CD-ROM drives, CAV systems are used. This is because seek performance would be greatly affected during random access by the requirement to continually modulate the disc&#x27;s rotation speed to be appropriate for the read head&#x27;s position.

== Dimensions ==

In case of a 12 cm standard diameter disc, data at the inner edge of the so-called &quot;program area&quot;, the area containing the data (2.5 cm from disc center) is accessed at 2.4 times the angular (rotation) speed of the disc compared to at the outer edge (6 cm from disc center).

For a miniature disc with a diameter of 8 cm (radius of 4 cm), the angular (rotation) speed ratio of outer to inner data edge is 1.6 if accessed at a constant linear velocity.

This means that, for example, at a constant linear velocity of ×10, the equivalent angular velocity of the disc is ×24 while the being accessed at the inner data area, while being ×10 during access at the outermost edge.

==Zoned constant linear velocity==

Zoned constant linear velocity (ZCLV or Z-CLV) is a modification of CLV for high speed CD and DVD recorders where a constant linear velocity is maintained until the next zone, when the speed is stepped up. Early model recorders were CLV drives. The recording speed on such drives was rated in multiples of 150 KiB/s; a 4X drive, for instance, would write steadily at around 600 KiB/s. The transfer rate was kept constant by having the spindle motor in the drive vary in speed and run 2.4 times as fast when recording at the inner rim of the disc as on the outer rim. Some high-speed recorders use the zoned CLV method (ZCLV), which divides the disc into stepped zones, each of which has its own constant linear velocity. When the current zone is finished and the next zone is reached, the disc rotation will speed up, usually to the same angular speed as at the beginning of the previous zone.

At higher speeds, ZCLV offers a compromise between CAV, which enables faster seek times, and CLV, which enables greater writing reliability. A ZCLV recorder rated at &quot;52X&quot;, for example, would write at a 52X disc rpm on the innermost zone and then progressively step down to 20X disc rpm at the outer rim to keep the rate at which bits are recorded by the laser within a narrow range. This method is used for higher-speed CD-RW variants due to the narrow writing speed range of rewriteable media.

==Constant angular acceleration==
Constant angular acceleration (CAA) is a variant of CLV that is used on the LaserDisc format. The initial specification of CLV (as it applies to LaserDisc) results in several playback artifacts being present in the audio/video portion as well as compatibility problems with LaserDisc players produced by different manufacturers.

In the mid 1980s, Pioneer Electronics introduced the CAA scheme, where the rotation speed of the LaserDisc was lowered in steps. This eliminated most playback artifacts and compatibility problems. Since its introduction, most manufacturers of LaserDiscs adopted the CAA format but still referred to their CAA-encoded product as CLV.

<doc id="1246865" wikidata="Q446986" url="?curid=1246865" title="Eric Staal">
<text>Eric Craig Staal (born October 29, 1984) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre who played eighteen seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Carolina Hurricanes, New York Rangers, Minnesota Wild, Buffalo Sabres, Montreal Canadiens, and Florida Panthers. Eric is the oldest of the Staal brothers, who include former teammates Marc, Jordan, and Jared.

Staal is a member of the Triple Gold Club, having won the Stanley Cup with the Hurricanes in 2006, and both the 2007 World Championships and the 2010 Winter Olympics with Team Canada.

==Early life==
Staal was born in Thunder Bay, Ontario, the son of sod farmers Henry and Linda Staal. All four of his grandparents were Dutch immigrants. He started playing hockey at the age of four, and along with learning how to operate farming tools he played in a home ice rink with his three younger brothers. His idols growing up were forwards Joe Sakic and Wayne Gretzky. Staal took his jersey number 12 from what his father wore when he played hockey for the Lakehead Thunderwolves from 1978 to 1983.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Staal grew up playing minor hockey in Thunder Bay, played AAA for the Thunder Bay Kings organization and led his Bantam team to an All-Ontario Championship in the 1999–2000 season. After the season, Staal was selected in the first round, 13th overall, in the 2000 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection by the Peterborough Petes. While not even his father, Henry, thought he may have been ready for the OHL, Staal finished his first season with 49 points in 63 games. His scoring totals increased the following season when he recorded 62 points.

In his draft year, Staal led the Petes in scoring with 39 goals and 98 points. He was named to the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) First All-Star Team as well as the OHL Second All-Star Team. Staal also skated in the CHL Top Prospects Game, recording one assist.

===Professional===
====Carolina Hurricanes (2003–2016)====
Staal was selected second overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the Carolina Hurricanes, behind number one pick Marc-André Fleury. He played his first season in the NHL right after being drafted. In 2004, Staal played in the YoungStars Game as part of the 2004 NHL All-Star festivities.

As the 2004–05 season was cancelled due to a lock-out, Staal spent the year with the Hurricanes&#x27; American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Lowell Lock Monsters. He established new franchise records in points (77), assists (51), plus-minus (+37) and 
shorthanded goals (7) in a season, and was also called for the AHL All Star Classic.

In the 2005–06 season, Staal scored a career-high 100 points during the regular season and was named NHL Offensive Player of the Week of October 23–30, 2005, the same week in which he scored his first career hat-trick, coming against the Philadelphia Flyers. He then led the Hurricanes in points during the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs with 28 as they won the Stanley Cup. After the season, Staal finished fourth in voting for the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player (MVP). Following the successful season, on July 1, 2006, Staal signed a three-year, $13.5 million contract extension with the Hurricanes.

Staal made his first All-Star Game appearance in 2007 All-Star Game in Dallas, where he scored the Eastern Conference&#x27;s third goal. His overall production dipped from the previous season, recording just 70 points.

On January 27, 2008, at the 2008 NHL All-Star Game in Atlanta, Staal recorded two goals and an assist. He was also awarded the MVP award for the event.

On September 11, 2008, Staal signed a seven-year, $57.75 million extension with the Hurricanes, which was to begin in the 2009–10 season. Staal was slated to become a restricted free agent on July 1, 2009, but signed despite having one year at $5 million remaining on his former contract.

On April 28, 2009, Staal capped an improbable comeback by scoring the series-winning goal with 31.7 seconds remaining in Game 7 of Carolina&#x27;s first-round series of the 2009 playoffs against the New Jersey Devils. His game-winning goal led to the comeback victory being nicknamed “&quot;Shock at the Rock&quot;. The Hurricanes went as far as the Eastern Conference Finals, ultimately losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Pittsburgh Penguins.

On May 8, 2009, Staal scored twice to earn 40 career post-season points, eclipsing Ron Francis&#x27; franchise mark of 39.
On January 20, 2010, Staal was named team captain, replacing Rod Brind&#x27;Amour, who was named an alternate captain. Staal became the fifth captain since the team relocated to the city of Raleigh, North Carolina, from Hartford.

On January 18, 2011, Staal was named one of two team captains for 2011 NHL All-Star Game, held in the Hurricanes&#x27; home city of Raleigh. In the Game, Team Staal fell 10–11 to Team Lidstrom, captained by the Detroit Red Wings&#x27; Nicklas Lidström.

====New York Rangers (2016)====
On February 28, 2016, Staal, in the final year of his contract, was traded to the New York Rangers in exchange for Aleksi Saarela and two second-round draft picks (2016 and 2017). Eric joined brother Marc in New York, but struggled for the Rangers, recording six points in 20 regular season games, and zero points in a five-game loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

====Minnesota Wild (2016–2020)====
During the subsequent offseason, Staal, as a free agent, signed a three-year contract with the Minnesota Wild on July 1, 2016. In his first season with the Wild, Staal recorded 28 goals and 65 points.

The 2017–18 season was a memorable one for Staal as he played his 1,000th game on March 19, 2017, and was also invited to his fifth NHL All-Star Game. Staal ended the season registering 42 goals, having his first 40 plus goal season since 2008–09.

On February 25, 2019, Staal agreed to a two-year, $6.5 million extension with the Wild. On December 15, 2019, Staal became the 89th player all-time to score 1000 career points.

====Buffalo Sabres (2020–2021)====
After completing his fourth season with the Wild and entering his final season under contract, Staal was traded by Minnesota to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for forward Marcus Johansson on September 16, 2020.

====Montreal Canadiens (2021)====
On March 26, 2021, the Buffalo Sabres traded Staal to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for third and fifth-round picks in the 2021 NHL Entry Draft.

====Iowa Wild (2022)====
As a free agent from the Canadiens, Staal remained un-signed leading into the 2021–22 season. Harbouring ambitions to represent Team Canada at the 2022 Winter Olympics, Staal resumed his professional career by agreeing to a professional try-out contract with the Iowa Wild of the AHL, an affiliate of former club the Minnesota Wild, on January 13, 2022. Staal made his debut for Iowa the following day, collecting a goal and assist against the Chicago Wolves in marking his first AHL game in over 16 years. In 4 appearances with the Iowa Wild, Staal collected 2 goals and 5 points before he was released from his tryout on January 23, 2022.

====Florida Panthers and retirement (2022–2023)====
Staal did not play an NHL game in the 2021–22 season. In July 2022, Staal signed a professional tryout contract (PTO) with the Florida Panthers, joining along with his brother Marc. Shortly after that, Staal signed a one-year contract with Florida. In March 2023, Eric, along with his brother Marc, refused to wear Pride-themed jerseys in the pre-game warmups as a part of the Panthers&#x27; annual Pride Night; they cited their Christian faith as the reason for their decision and despite that Eric did wear Pride-themed jersey as a member of the Montreal Canadiens during the 2020–21 NHL season. The rest of the Florida Panthers team members wore the jerseys during warmups to be later auctioned for charity.

On July 30, 2024, Staal signed a one-day contract with the Hurricanes and retired from professional hockey. On January 12, 2025 the Hurricanes retired Staal&#x27;s number 12, joining Glen Wesley, Ron Francis, and Rod Brind’Amour in having their jerseys retired. 

==International play==



Staal received his first calls to Team Canada for the 2007 World Championships in Moscow. Along with younger brother Jordan, he won gold in a 4–2 win against Finland, scoring five goals, including the overtime winner in the quarter-finals over the Czech Republic. In the following year, Staal was back with Team Canada at the 2008 World Championships in Quebec City, winning a silver medal. He scored eight goals in the tournament, four of them in Canada&#x27;s 10–1 defeat of Germany.

Four years after being named only for Canada&#x27;s taxi squad for the 2006 Winter Olympics, Staal was selected for the Canadian team at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. He became a starter alongside Sidney Crosby and Jarome Iginla, and scored one goal and five assists on the path to a gold medal. The Olympic title added to previous NHL and World Championship wins, made Staal the 23rd player in the Triple Gold Club.

Staal was named captain of Team Canada in the 2013 World Championships in Stockholm. He would get injured in the first period of the quarter-finals, which Canada ended up losing to eventual champions Sweden, after a knee-on-knee hit by defenceman Alexander Edler.

In 2022, Staal captained Team Canada to a sixth-place finish at the 2022 Winter Olympics.

==Personal life==
Staal married his longtime girlfriend, Tanya Van den Broeke on August 3, 2007. The couple have three sons. Staal is Christian.

In 2012, the Staal Brothers created the Staal Family Foundation, an organization that tries “to help improve the quality of life for children with cancer and their families.”

In March 2023, Eric and his brother Marc publicly declared that being gay or being LGBTQ+ goes against their beliefs and cited their Christian beliefs as the reason why they chose not to wear the jerseys, along with fellow NHLer Ivan Proverov.

<doc id="1246882" wikidata="Q5600013" url="?curid=1246882" title="Great Southern Railways">
<text>The Great Southern Railways Company (often Great Southern Railways, or GSR) was an Irish company that from 1925 until 1945 owned and operated all railways that lay wholly within the Irish Free State (the present-day Republic of Ireland).

The period was difficult with rising operating costs and static to failing income. The early part of the period was soon after infrastructure losses of the Irish Civil War. The Emergency or Second World War at the end of the period saw shortages of coal and raw materials with increased freight traffic and restricted passenger traffic.

==History==
===Context===
Civil unrest in Ireland had led to the assumption of governmental control of all railways operating in the Island of Ireland on 22 December 1916 through the Irish Railways Executive Committee, later succeeded by the Ministry of Transport. Control was returned to the management of the companies on 15 August 1921. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921 establishing the Irish Free State and subsequent Irish Civil War all combined to be damaging to the railways of Ireland widespread and extensive damage to infrastructure and rolling stock. Between 1916 and 1921 revenues had doubled while operating costs and wages had quadrupled. When the GS&amp;WR, by far the largest of the companies, announced it would cease operations on 8 January 1923. The Irish Free State had already recognised the importance of the railway system and had set up the Railway Commission to advise on ownership in April 1922. The impending collapse led to the process that was to create the GSR.

===Formation===
Provision for the creation of the company was made by the Railways Act 1924, which mandated the amalgamation (in the case of the four major railway companies) and absorption (of the 22 smaller companies) of all railways wholly within the Irish Free State. Only cross-border railways, most notably the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway (SL&amp;NCR), remained outside its control.

====First amalgamation====
The Great Southern and Western Railway Company, the Midland Great Western Railway Company of Ireland and the Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway Company agreed to terms for amalgamation, forming the Great Southern Railway Company by way of the Railways (Great Southern) Preliminary Amalgamation Scheme of 12 November 1924 (SI no. 31 of that year).

====DSER joins====
The Great Southern Railways Company was formed when the fourth major company, the Dublin and South Eastern Railway (DSER), joined these companies under the Great Southern Railways Amalgamation Scheme of 1 January 1925 (SI no. 1 of that year) and the Great Southern Railways Supplemental Amalgamation Scheme, also 1925. The DSER was substantially British-owned and had wished to merge with the GNR but was overruled.

====Smaller companies====
The smaller companies were absorbed under several successive statutory instruments.

====Omissions and anomalies====
CIÉ previously maintained a full online list of the twenty five companies which constituted the Great Southern Railways in 1925. This is not entirely accurate, as it includes the Fishguard &amp; Rosslare Railways &amp; Harbours Company which still exists today, although GSR took over 50% of its shares upon its creation, the other 50% being held by the UK Great Western Railway. The respective shareholdings in the company, now essentially a shelf company, are held today by Iarnród Éireann and Stena Line.

Two companies that were not amalgamated but whose tracks the GSR retained operating rights over were the City of Dublin Junction Railway, and the New Ross and Waterford Extension.

Three railways remained completely outside of the amalgamation process, despite lying wholly within the Free State. These were the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee, the Listowel and Ballybunion Railway and the Dublin and Lucan Electric Railway.

===Early years===
The GS&amp;WR was the dominant constituent in terms of area, route millage and rolling stock. The GSR&#x27;s headquarters were established at Kingsbridge and Inchicore became the chief engineering works. The former Dublin and South Eastern section in particular had become extremely run down and needed extensive remedial work on its rolling stock with about one-third condemned with immediate effect. Revenue for passengers decreased from £1.91m in 1925 to £1.28m by 1931, that for freight decreasing from £2.27m to £2.05m.

===Buses and hotels===
From 1929, when it acquired a stake in the Irish Omnibus Company, the company also ran bus services. These operations became the responsibility, from 1 January 1934, of the Great Southern Railways Omnibus Department.

The group owned a number of hotels, and in 1990 the hotel group was transferred from Córas Iompair Éireann to Aer Rianta, in the ownership of which it remained until 2006. The hotel group formed by the company, Great Southern Hotels, continued to bear that name until its privatisation in 2006. Only the Sligo hotel continued to use the Great Southern name as of 2016, but in January 2018 The Malton Hotel in Killarney reverted to its original name of the Great Southern.

===1930s===
Worldwide economic conditions continued to be difficult and affected Ireland also, passenger and freight revenue decreased to £1.27m and £2.05m by 1939.

===Second World War===
Although the Republic of Ireland was a neutral country, railway transport was severely disrupted by The Emergency. The lack of high-quality coal fuel in Ireland and the need to import from England was severe and desperate alternatives such as turf-burning had only extremely limited success. By 1944 most non-suburban passenger services were restricted to Mondays and Thursdays only with some curtailed altogether. 

===Transfer to CIÉ===
The Transport Act 1944 dissolved the company and transferred its assets, together with those of the Dublin United Transport Company to Córas Iompair Éireann, from 1 January 1945.

==Route network==
Over the period of the GSR&#x27;s existence, the total route network was reduced slightly from in 1925 to at the end in 1944. Among the few lines closed in the intervening years were the former Midland Great Western lines from Galway to Clifden (in 1935) and from Westport to Achill (in 1937).

The stretch of line that was double track was reduced more significantly, from to in the same period.

==Locomotives and rolling stock==

===Locomotives===

A wide variety of locomotives and rolling stock was inherited from the constituent companies. 1925 records show 526 broad and 41 narrow gauge steam locomotives remaining inherited from the originating companies. Locomotives were renumbered into the GSR class number scheme whereby the lowest numbered engine in the class was used as the class identity. There was a parallel Inchicore scheme that used a letter to indicate the axle layout and a number to designate different groups within the class.

When the GSR passed into CIÉ at the end of 1944 the total number of broad gauge steam locomotives was about 475 of which 58 had been built by GSR. About 28 narrow gauge steam locomotives remained.

===Rolling stock===
The total number of passenger vehicles including post office, parcel, and brake vans was 1670 in 1925, falling to 1337 by 1944.

===Railcars===

The GSR introduced four Sentinel steam railcars in 1928 with power units similar to the GSR Class 280, operating range of over and a passenger capacity of 55. All were withdrawn in the early 1940s. A subsequent order from Claytons in 1928 was less successful and withdrawn in 1932. A model exists in the Fry railway collection. Four Drewry petrol-powered railcars, of which two were narrow gauge, were also introduced around 1927, with all four also being withdrawn by the mid 1940s. The innovative Drumm Battery Train was successfully operated on the Dublin—Bray route from 1932.

<doc id="1246883" wikidata="Q202915" url="?curid=1246883" title="Tom's Diner">
<text>&quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; is a song by American singer and songwriter Suzanne Vega. Written on November 18, 1981, it was first released as a track on the January 1984 issue of &quot;Fast Folk Musical Magazine&quot;. Originally featured on her second studio album, &quot;Solitude Standing&quot; (1987), it was released as a single in Europe only in 1987 following the success of her single &quot;Luka&quot;. It was later used as the basis for a remix by the British group DNA in 1990, which reached No. 1 in Austria, Germany, Greece and Switzerland.

The song is also known for its use in testing various digital compression schemes during the development of the MP3, earning Vega the title of &quot;Mother of the MP3&quot;.

==Original version==
===Background and writing===

The &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; of the song is Tom&#x27;s Restaurant in New York City, a mid-20th-century diner on the northeast corner of Broadway and West 112th Street. Singer and songwriter Suzanne Vega was reputedly a frequent patron during the early 1980s when she was a student at nearby Barnard College. The diner later became famous as the location used for the exterior scenes of Monk&#x27;s Café in the popular 1990s television sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

The song begins with the narrator stopping at a diner for a cup of coffee. The song mentions reading a newspaper as well as seeing two women, one who enters the diner and one who stands outside in the rain. The ringing of bells at a nearby cathedral (St. John the Divine) causes the narrator to reminisce about an unnamed companion and a midnight picnic. At the end of the song, the narrator leaves the diner to catch the train after the coffee is finished.

Vega wrote the song based on a comment by her friend Brian Rose, a photographer, who mentioned that in his work, he sometimes felt as if &quot;he saw his whole life through a pane of glass, and [...] like he was the witness to a lot of things, but was never really involved in them&quot;. She attempted to think and write in this fashion (including a male perspective) while sitting at Tom&#x27;s Restaurant.

===&quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner Day&quot;: The date of the composition===
An article on Suzanne Vega&#x27;s official website uses clues in the song to determine the exact date that Vega wrote it.

Vega said that she wrote the song in 1982; Brian Rose has said that it was written sometime between mid-1981 and mid-1982. The lyrics refer to a rainy morning, when she was at the diner on the corner, reading in her newspaper of &quot;a story of an actor / who had died while he was drinking&quot;, and afterwards &quot;turning to the horoscope / and looking for the funnies&quot;. Only two newspapers in New York City carried comic strips, or &quot;funnies&quot;, in 1981 and 1982, and only one, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, featured a front-page story of the death of Oscar-winning actor William Holden, whose body was discovered on Monday, November 16, 1981. In a 2008 essay for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vega confirmed that Holden was the actor whose death she had read about and inspired the line in the song.

===Music and lyrics===
Vega conceived &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; as a piece for voice and solo piano. Two versions feature on her album &quot;Solitude Standing&quot;; the album opens with an a cappella version, and closes with an instrumental version played on keyboards, with guitars lending support.

===The &quot;Mother of the MP3&quot;===
&quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; was used by the researcher Karlheinz Brandenburg as a reference in developing the MP3 audio compression scheme. He recalled: &quot;I was ready to fine-tune my compression algorithm...somewhere down the corridor, a radio was playing &#x27;Tom&#x27;s Diner.&#x27; I was electrified. I knew it would be nearly impossible to compress this warm a cappella voice.&quot;

In a 2009 documentary about the history of the song by Swedish SVT, Brandenburg said: &quot;I was finishing my PhD thesis, and then I was reading some hi-fi magazine and found that they had used this song to test loudspeakers. I said &#x27;OK, let&#x27;s test what this song does to my sound system, to MP3&#x27;. And the result was, at bit rates where everything else sounded quite nice, Suzanne Vega&#x27;s voice sounded horrible.&quot;

Brandenburg adopted the song for testing purposes, listening to it again and again each time he refined the scheme, making sure it did not adversely affect the subtlety of Vega&#x27;s voice. While the MP3 compression format is not specifically tuned to play the song &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; (an assortment of critically analyzed material was involved in the design of the codec over many years), among audio engineers this anecdote has earned Vega the informal title &quot;The Mother of the MP3&quot;.

==DNA remix==
===Background===
In 1990, two British record producers under the name DNA remixed &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot;, grafting Vega&#x27;s vocals onto a dance beat from Soul II Soul (&quot;Keep On Movin&#x27;&quot;) and turning her simple ad-libbed outro – &quot;Do do do uh, do da-do uh&quot; – into the song&#x27;s driving hook. At the time, it was impossible to get a whole song into a sampler, so they spent evenings and weekends cutting Vega&#x27;s vocals into little bits. Without permission from Vega, her record label, or publisher, the duo released the remix on a limited basis for distribution to clubs as &quot;Oh Suzanne&quot; by &quot;DNA featuring Suzanne Vega&quot;. Vega&#x27;s record company of the time, A&amp;M, arranged to release the remix rather than take DNA to court for copyright infringement.

A&amp;M struck the deal after consulting with Vega, who liked the interpretation. Vega told a British columnist, &quot;(A&amp;M) asked me what I thought of it and I told them it was really kind of nice. So I said, &#x27;Go ahead and release it.&#x27; I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be successful—I never thought it would be that popular. It just seemed very charming.&quot; The remix became a much larger hit than Vega had with the song originally, peaking at number two on the UK Singles Chart and number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and it became one of a handful of tracks to chart in the top 10 of both the Modern Rock Tracks (number seven) and &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Singles (number 10) charts. The remix also reached number one in Austria, Germany, Greece and Switzerland.

The remix of the song is written in the key of F minor in common time with a tempo of 99 beats per minute. Vega&#x27;s vocals span from F3 to E4 in the song.

===Critical reception===
Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; commented, &quot;Don&#x27;t miss the exceptional &#x27;Tom&#x27;s Diner&#x27;, by DNA featuring Suzanne Vega.&quot; He noted that the Brit outfit had placed &quot;a slammin&#x27; Soul II Soul-flavored swing instrumental&quot; underneath Vega&#x27;s song, and also described the track as &quot;indelibly infectious.&quot; Student newspaper &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot; named it a &quot;surprise hit&quot;. Marisa Fox from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; complimented its dance beat as &quot;mesmerizing&quot;. Patrick Goldstein from &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said, &quot;Strange but true-almost.&quot; He added that the &quot;waif-like pop songstress&quot; has suddenly become the &quot;queen of London&#x27;s trendy club scene, thanks to her sinewy, Soul II Soul-style dance hit&quot;. Everett True from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; commented, &quot;This is so f***ing smooth. You know the original, I&#x27;m sure Suzanne&#x27;s unaccompanied tale of everyday morning life in the big city in the wake of a break-up, incisively, poignantly observed. Magical. Now imagine it set to an unobtrusive, mellow backbeat which slips down even easier. F***ing superb! What is it about today? Single of the week. No shit.&quot; 

A reviewer of &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; found that &quot;the lonely vocal part is perfectly complemented by the Steely Dan type horns and the grinding hip-hop beat. A fine version.&quot; &quot;Music Week&quot; ranked the song number-one in their Top 10 list, &quot;Pick of the Year – Dance&quot;. Diane Tameecha from &quot;The Network Forty&quot; felt the connection of Vega&#x27;s &quot;sensuously soft voice and the unlikely rhythm (for her music, anyway) is startlingly vibrant, and its jazziness is an instant ear-catcher.&quot; Mandi James from &quot;NME&quot; named it Single of the Week, writing, &quot;A strange record, if only for the fact Suzanne Vega has previously failed to move me in any way, except to get up and leave the room. Dropped against a sensual, tactile beat those irritatingly vacant girly vocals are miraculously transformed into a hypnotic, bitter sweet ballad. The crushing folking bore has been given a new lease of life and should be eternally grateful to plastic surgeons DNA. The nearest thing to perfection I&#x27;ve heard all week.&quot; &quot;Smash Hits&quot;&#x27;s reviewer said remixes like this one &quot;end up sounding far better than the originals and the result is rather refreshing.&quot; Alec Foege from &quot;Spin&quot; remarked that &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; was an international hit &quot;only after DNA did a dance remix&quot;.

===Impact and legacy===
In 2004, &quot;Q&quot; magazine featured the DNA remix of the song in their list of &quot;The 1010 Songs You Must Own&quot;.

===Music video===
A music video was produced to promote the song, directed by Gareth Roberts. It does not feature Vega.

==Giorgio Moroder version==
For the release of his fourteenth studio album &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; on June 12, 2015, record producer Giorgio Moroder included a remake of the song, featuring American singer Britney Spears on his album as the eighth track. It was later released as the album&#x27;s fourth and final single on October 9, 2015, with two new remixes included, marking the second release from Spears in 2015, following &quot;Pretty Girls&quot;, and additionally her first featuring participation since &quot;S&amp;M (Remix)&quot; in 2011.

Despite being a non-single track at that time, it became Moroder&#x27;s best-selling digital song to date, debuting and peaking at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Electronic Songs chart, and number fourteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Electronic Digital Songs chart, during the week of July 4, 2015.

==Remakes and samples==

===Remakes===
The song spawned a number of hip hop, dance, and rock remixes and remakes from artists such as Peter Behrens (drummer from Trio) and Bingo Hand Job, a whimsical one-time collaboration between Billy Bragg and R.E.M. It was also sampled in songs by Public Enemy, Nikki D, 2Pac, Twin Hype, Yo Gotti and Lil&#x27; Kim, among other hip hop acts.

In 1991, Vega, noting the huge number of remakes of the song, released &quot;Tom&#x27;s Album&quot;, a compilation of different versions of the song, spanning a variety of musical genres, including a parody by Mark Jonathan Davis that worked in references to &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; called &quot;Jeannie&#x27;s Diner&quot;, which Nick at Nite would use to promote its airings of the show. The album also featured another DNA remix of one of her songs, &quot;Rusted Pipe&quot;. On the album&#x27;s sleeve, Vega wrote: &quot;A small song about eating breakfast became a song about accidental pregnancy (Daddy&#x27;s Little Girl – Nikki D.) and the recent war in the Gulf (Waiting at the Border). One version incorporates forgotten bits of pop culture (Jeannie&#x27;s Diner). All of them surprised me; a couple made me wince. I include them anyway.&quot;

In 2015, sound artist and composer Ryan Maguire released the track &quot;moDernisT&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot;) as a part of his project &quot;The Ghost in the MP3&quot;. &quot;moDernisT&quot; is composed exclusively of the sounds deleted during MP3 compression from the song &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot;, known as the mother of the MP3. A detailed account of the techniques used to isolate the sounds deleted during MP3 compression, along with the conceptual motivation for the project, was published in the 2014 Proceedings of the International Computer Music Conference.

In 2020, English producer Robbie Doherty remixed the song with artist Keees, titling it &quot;Pour the Milk&quot;, launching it to No. 44 on the UK Singles Chart.

As of 2023, there are over 50 versions of &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot;.

===Samples and Interpolations===
American rock band Fall Out Boy used an interpolation of &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; in their song &quot;Centuries&quot;.

In 2022, music duo Sofi Tukker sampled the song on their single &quot;Summer in New York&quot;.

In 2024, American rapper Cupcakke interpolated the song in her track &quot;Dora&quot; on her album &quot;Dauntless Manifesto&quot;. In the same year, Puerto Rican singer Myke Towers and American producer Benny Blanco used the song as a melodic base in their song &quot;Degenere&quot;.

In 2025, K-pop girl group IVE interpolated the song in their title track &quot;Attitude&quot;.

<text>St George&#x27;s School, Harpenden (also known as St George&#x27;s) is a non-selective state day and boarding school in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, England, educating students of both sexes between the ages of eleven and eighteen, with an emphasis on its Christian ethos. It was founded in 1907 as one of Britain&#x27;s first mixed-sex boarding schools. The school has International School status. The School was named as the Sunday Times&#x27; &#x27;Comprehensive School of the Year&#x27; in 2019. In 2022, the School was ranked as the 122nd best secondary state school in the country based on combined GCSE attainment and A-Level point scores.

== History ==
The school was founded in 1907 by Reverend Cecil Grant, having relocated his school southwards from Keswick, Cumbria in the Lake District to the site of the previous school.

In 1898 Grant, who was interested in co-education, was appointed the first headmaster of the newly reopened Keswick School. Along with Bedales School the school was the first co-educational day/boarding school in England. After a number of years, difficulties with the local authority and lack of a chapel prompted a move. The Harpenden site was discovered by one of the masters, a new limited company was formed and Grant together with 59 boys and girls and many of the staff moved there. The new school where pupils &quot;could live in an atmosphere closely related to family life, based on sound Christian principles&quot; was officially opened in 21 June 1907.

The Harpenden site had previously been home to a boarding school for 100 boys founded by Rev. Wix in 1887. A chapel was added in 1891 and a swimming pool in 1894. The school experienced a drop in numbers, with several masters and pupils leaving, and closed in 1904. The site was briefly leased to a branch of the United Services College.

In 1916 Grant founded a separate Montessori unit for pupils from 2 to 8 years of age. The initial location is unclear, but in 1924 moved to Kingston Lodge, adjacent to the school grounds. (Kingston Lodge later became Goddard House is now the music school.) In 1932 the school was renamed to St George&#x27;s Children&#x27;s House to attract larger numbers. Its business interests were formally merged with the main school from 1949. In 1955 it broke ties with St George&#x27;s and moved to Gorselands near Harpenden common.

Grant retired in 1936 and A. H. Watts took over as headmaster, leading the school through the war years. Houses of the school were named after both men as well as Monk and Goddard, old Georgians who had died in the First World War. Names of the boarding houses: Crosthwaite, Keswick and Skiddaw come from locations near the Cumbrian school.

The Cinema Museum in London holds film of the school, its sports day, processions and activities from 1949.

In 1967 the school became under the control of Hertfordshire County Council, initially as a Grammar School and
then as a Voluntary Aided School in the mid 1970&#x27;s. This period saw a large expansion of the school with many new buildings and numbers expanding to 800. On 1 July 2012 St George&#x27;s became an academy, funded by the new St George&#x27;s School Harpenden Academy Trust. It continues to be supported by the Cecil Grant Founder&#x27;s Trust, a charity set up after Grant&#x27;s death in 1946.

The St. George&#x27;s motto &quot;Levavi Oculos&quot; (Aim Higher) appears on the uniform badges. It derives from their School Hymn, &quot;Assurgit&quot;, which is sung in Latin. &quot;Levavi Oculos&quot; means &quot;I have lifted up mine eyes&quot; and alludes to Psalm 121, beginning &quot;I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help; my help cometh even from the Lord, who hath made Heaven and Earth.&quot; In the sense of &quot;I have raised my sights&quot; this is equivalent to the English motto &quot;Aim Higher,&quot; which appears over one archway at the front entrance of Keswick House.

== Christian ethos ==
Admission to the school for day students is based mainly on location of students&#x27; homes, with students coming from many of the surrounding towns and villages. Regular attendance at a local church is required; however, the school itself is non-denominational and does not receive funding from any religious group or church.

The school is centred on a late-nineteenth-century chapel, which is led by a resident chaplain and supported by a part-time organist.

== House System ==

In 1972, the House System is introduced in St Georges School. The house are named after several old students and headteachers.

* Goddard - Red, Named after Lister Goddard, who is an old pupil, and died in WW1
* Grant-Green,Named after Cecil Grant who founded the school.
* Monk-Blue,Named after Bertram monk who fought in the war and died while attempting to capture a machine gun.
* Watts-Yellow,Named after Dr.Watts who was the second headmaster of the school.

==Academics==
In 2019 St George&#x27;s was ranked third in examination results in the country for state schools and rivals some of the private schools. Its academic Sixth Form has the third highest progress score in the county, beating almost all local Independent Schools (Including St Alban’s School and Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School).

In 2014 it received an Outstanding Ofsted rating. It has a Progress 8 measure of 0.95 which is well above average.

==Extra-curricular activities==
The school music department (via on-site tuition company Musicale) offer peripatetic instrumental tuition for all woodwind, string and brass instruments as well as classical and jazz piano, guitar, drums and voice. Regular concerts take place in the chapel and the old library. During the autumn term each year, the Music Department collaborate with the Drama and Performing Arts Department to produce a whole school production. The Drama Department also host an &#x27;Inter-House Drama Festival&#x27;, which is adjudicated by a professional actor, and a lower-school drama production.

In 1939 St George&#x27;s School won the first National Schools Sevens tournament and has continued this Rugby success producing Rugby Sevens and Rugby Union internationals. The Rugby teams continue this legacy today producing many England Under-18 and Under-16 Rugby Players.

The school is notable for having first fielded the English national players Owen Farrell and Maro Itoje, alongside two other members of England&#x27;s rugby union team (as of 2019).

Until September 2019, house points cumulated via means of various events would form an overall tally and the winning house be awarded the Chapman Cup.

The Chapman Cup has since been re-named the Endeavour Cup. 

== Boarding ==

Keswick and Crosthwaite House provide boarding accommodation for girl and boy boarders respectively.

St George&#x27;s was one of the first schools in Britain to provide mixed-sex boarding education.

<doc id="1246911" wikidata="Q16995" url="?curid=1246911" title="History of the Jews in Canada">
<text>The history of the Jews in Canada goes back to the 1700s. Canadian Jews, whether by culture, ethnicity, or religion, form the fourth largest Jewish community in the world, exceeded only by those in Israel, the United States and France. In the 2021 census, 335,295 people reported their religion as Jewish, accounting for 0.9% of the Canadian population. Some estimates have placed the enlarged number of Jews, such as those who may be culturally or ethnically Jewish, though not necessarily religiously, at more than 400,000 people, or approximately 1.4% of the Canadian population.

The Jewish community in Canada is composed predominantly of Ashkenazi Jews. Other Jewish ethnic divisions are also represented and include Sephardi Jews, Mizrahi Jews, and Bene Israel. A number of converts to Judaism make up the Jewish-Canadian community, which manifests a wide range of Jewish cultural traditions and the full spectrum of Jewish religious observance. Though they are a small minority, they have had an open presence in the country since the first Jewish immigrants arrived with Governor Edward Cornwallis to establish Halifax, Nova Scotia (1749). The 1760s saw the first Jewish settlers in New France who arrived in Montreal after the British conquest of the city, among them was Aaron Hart who is considered the father of Canadian Jewry. His son Ezekiel Hart experience one of the first well documented cases of antisemitism in Canada. Hart was consistently prevented from taking his seat at the Quebec legislature, with members contending he could not take the oath of office as a Jew, which included the phrase &quot;on the true faith of a Christian&quot;. By the 1970s and 1980s, most legal barriers were removed, and Jews began to hold significant positions in Canadian society. However, antisemitism persists, evident in hate crimes and extremist groups.

== Settlement (1783–1897) ==
Prior to the British conquest of New France, Jews lived in Nova Scotia. There were no official Jews in Quebec because when King Louis XIV made Canada officially a province of the Kingdom of France in 1663, he decreed that only Roman Catholics could enter the colony. One exception was Esther Brandeau, a Jewish girl who arrived in 1738 disguised as a boy and remained a year before she was returned for refusing to convert. The earliest subsequent documentation of Jews in Canada are British Army records from the French and Indian War, the North American part of the Seven Years&#x27; War. In 1760, General Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst attacked and seized Montreal, winning Canada for the British. Several Jews were members of his regiments, and among his officer corps were five Jews: Samuel Jacobs, Emmanuel de Cordova, Aaron Hart, Hananiel Garcia, and Isaac Miramer.

The most prominent of these five were the business associates Samuel Jacobs and Aaron Hart. In 1759, in his capacity as Commissariat to the British Army on the staff of General Sir Frederick Haldimand, Jacobs was recorded as the first Jewish resident of Quebec, and thus the first Canadian Jew. From 1749, Jacobs had been supplying British army officers at Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1758, he was at Fort Cumberland and the following year he was with Wolfe&#x27;s army at Quebec. Remaining in Canada, he became the dominant merchant of the Richelieu valley and Seigneur of Saint-Denis-sur-Richelieu. Because he married a French Canadian girl and brought his children up as Catholics, Jacobs is often overlooked as the first permanent Jewish settler in Canada in favour of Aaron Hart, who married a Jew and brought up his children, or at least his sons, in the Jewish tradition.

Lieutenant Hart first arrived in Canada from New York City as Commissariat to Jeffery Amherst&#x27;s forces at Montreal in 1760. After his service in the army ended, he settled at Trois-Rivières, where he became a wealthy landowner and respected community member. He had four sons, Moses, Benjamin, Ezekiel and Alexander, all of whom would become prominent in Montreal and help build the Jewish Community. Ezekiel was elected to the legislature of Lower Canada in the by-election of April 11, 1807, becoming the first Jew in an official opposition in the British Empire. Ezekiel was expelled from the legislature with his religion a major factor. Sir James Henry Craig, Governor-General of Lower Canada, tried to protect Hart, but French Canadians saw this as an attempt of the British to undermine them and the legislature expelled Hart in both 1808 and following his re-election in 1809. The legislature then barred Jews from holding elected office in Canada until the passage of the 1832 &quot;Emancipation Act&quot;.

Most of the early Jewish Canadians were either fur traders or served in the British Army troops. A few were merchants or landowners. Although Montreal&#x27;s Jewish community was small, numbering only around 200, they built the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal, Shearith Israel, the oldest synagogue in Canada, in 1768. It remained the only synagogue in Montreal until 1846. Some sources date the actual establishment of the synagogue to 1777 on Notre Dame Street.

Revolts and protests soon began calling for responsible government in Canada. The law requiring the oath &quot;on my faith as a Christian&quot; was amended in 1829 to provide for Jews to refuse the oath. In 1831, prominent French-Canadian politician Louis-Joseph Papineau sponsored a law which granted full equivalent political rights to Jews, twenty-seven years before anywhere else in the British Empire. In 1832, partly because of the work of Ezekiel Hart, a law was passed that guaranteed Jews the same political rights and freedoms as Christians. In the early 1830s, German Jew Samuel Liebshitz founded Jewsburg (now incorporated as German Mills into Kitchener, Ontario), a village in Upper Canada. In 1841, Isaac Gottschalk Ascher arrived in Montreal with his family, including sons Isidore, a highly acclaimed poet and novelist; and Jacob, a national chess champion (1878, 1883). 
By 1850, there were still only 450 Jews living in Canada, mostly concentrated in Montreal.

Toronto&#x27;s first Jewish prayer services were held on Rosh Hashanah, September 29, 1856, initially with a Sefer Torah borrowed from Canada&#x27;s only other synagogue, the Spanish and Portuguese Congregation of Montreal.
A year later in 1857 a permanent Torah arrived as a gift from Montreal, inscribed in Hebrew to &quot;The Holy Congregation, Blossoms of Holiness [Pirchei Kodesh], in the city of Toronto.&quot; The name resonated among the congregants, and on July 23, 1871, the synagogue officially adopted the name פרחי קדש — Toronto Holy Blossom Temple.

Abraham Jacob Franks settled in Quebec City in 1767. His son, David Salesby (or Salisbury) Franks, who afterward became head of the Montreal Jewish community, also lived in Quebec prior to 1774. Abraham Joseph, who was long a prominent figure in public affairs in Quebec City, took up his residence there shortly after his father&#x27;s death in 1832. Quebec City&#x27;s Jewish population for many years remained very small, and early efforts at organization were fitful and short-lived. A cemetery was acquired in 1853, and a place of worship was opened in a hall in the same year, in which services were held intermittently. In 1892, the Jewish population of Quebec City had sufficiently augmented to permit the permanent establishment of the present synagogue, Beth Israel. The congregation was granted the right of keeping a register in 1897. Other communal institutions were the Quebec Hebrew Sick Benefit Association, the Quebec Hebrew Relief Association for Immigrants, and the Quebec Zionist Society. By 1905, the Jewish population was about 350, in a total population of 68,834. 

According to the census of 1871, there were 1,115 Jews living in Canada, including 409 in Montreal, 157 in Toronto, and 131 in Hamilton.

==Community growth (1862–1939)==

With the beginning of the pogroms of Russia in the 1880s, and continuing through the growing anti-Semitism of the early 20th century, millions of Jews began to flee the Pale of Settlement and other areas of Eastern Europe for the West. Although the United States received the overwhelming majority of these immigrants, Canada was also a destination of choice due to Government of Canada and Canadian Pacific Railway efforts to develop Canada after Confederation. Between 1880 and 1930, the Jewish population of Canada grew to over 155,000. At the time, according to the 1901 census of Montreal, only 6,861 Jews were residents.

Jewish immigrants brought a tradition of establishing a communal body, called a kehilla to look after the social and welfare needs of their less fortunate. Virtually all of these Jewish refugees were very poor. Wealthy Jewish philanthropists, who had come to Canada much earlier, felt it was their social responsibility to help their fellow Jews get established in this new country. One such man was Abraham de Sola, who founded the Hebrew Philanthropic Society. In Montreal and Toronto, a wide range of communal organizations and groups developed. Recently arrived immigrant Jews also founded &quot;landsmenschaften&quot;, guilds of people who came originally from the same village.

Most of these immigrants established communities in the larger cities. Canada&#x27;s first ever census, recorded that in 1871 there were 1,115 Jews in Canada; 409 in Montreal, 157 in Toronto, 131 in Hamilton and the rest were dispersed in small communities along the St. Lawrence River. When elected mayor of Alexandria in 1914, George Simon was the second Jewish mayor in Canada (after David Oppenheimer, who was mayor of Vancouver from 1888 to 1891) and the youngest mayor in the country at the time. He died suddenly in 1969 while serving his tenth term in office.

A community of about 100 settled in Victoria, British Columbia to open shops to supply prospectors during the Cariboo Gold Rush (and later the Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon). This led to the opening of a synagogue in Victoria, British Columbia in 1862. In 1875, B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Canada was formed as a Jewish fraternal organization. When British Columbia sent their delegation to Ottawa to agree on the colony&#x27;s entry into Confederation, a Jew, Henry Nathan, Jr., was among them. Nathan eventually became the first Canadian Jewish Member of Parliament. In 1899, the Federation of Canadian Zionist Societies was founded to champion Zionism, and became the first nation-wide Jewish group. The overwhelming majority of Canadian Jews were &quot;Ashkenazim&quot; who came from either the Austrian empire or the Russian empire. Jewish women tended to be particularly active in Canadian Zionism, perhaps because many of the Zionist groups were secular.

By 1911, there were Jewish communities in all of Canada&#x27;s major cities. By 1914, there were about 100,000 Jews in Canada with three-quarters living in either Montreal or Toronto. The overwhelming majority of Canadian Jews were &quot;Ashkenazim&quot; who came from either the Austrian or Russian Empires. There were two competing strands of Jewish nationalism in Eastern Europe in the early 20th century, namely Zionism and another tendency that favoured forming separate Jewish cultural institutions with a focus on promoting Yiddish. Institutions such as the Montreal Jewish Library with its collection of Yiddish books were examples of the latter tendency.

The Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) was founded in 1919 and would be the major representative body of the Canadian Jewish community for 90 years. Much of its work was focused on lobbying government around issues of immigration, human rights and anti-Semitism. One of the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles were the so-called &quot;minorities treaties&quot; that committed Eastern European states with substantial Jewish populations such as Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia to protect the rights of minorities with the League of Nations to monitor their compliance. The CJC was founded in part to lobby the government of Canada to use its influence at the League of Nations to ensure that the Eastern European states were abiding by the terms of the &quot;minorities treaties&quot;.

On August 16, 1933, one of the most famous anti-Semitic incidents in Canada took place, known as the Christie Pits riot. On that day after a baseball game in Toronto a group of young men using Nazi symbols started a massive melee, arguably the largest in Toronto&#x27;s history, on the ground of racial hatred, involving hundreds of men.

In 1934, another anti-Semitic incident occurred when the first medical strike in a Canadian hospital was held in response to the appointment of a Jewish doctor to Montreal&#x27;s Notre-Dame Hospital. Dr Sam Rabinovitch would have been the first Jew appointed to the a French-Canadian hospital. The four-day strike, nicknamed the &quot;Days of Shame&quot;, involved interns refusing to &quot;provide care to anyone, including emergency patients&quot;. The strike was called off after Dr Rabinovitch resigned after he realised that no patients would be treated otherwise.

===Westward expansion===

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, through such movements as the Jewish Colonization Association, 15 Jewish farm colonies were established on the Canadian prairies. Few of the colonies did very well, partly because the Jews of East European origin were forbidden to own farms in the old country and thus had little experience in farming. One settlement that did do well was Yid&#x27;n Bridge, Saskatchewan, started by South African farmers. Eventually the community grew larger as the South African Jews, who had gone to South Africa from Lithuania invited Jewish families directly from Europe to join them, and the settlement eventually became a town, whose name was later changed to the Anglicized name of Edenbridge. The Jewish farming settlement folded in the first generation. Beth Israel Synagogue at Edenbridge is now a designated heritage site. In Alberta, the Little Synagogue on the Prairie is now in the collection of a museum.

At this time, most of the Jewish Canadians in the west were either storekeepers or tradesmen. Many set up shops on the new rail lines, selling goods and supplies to the construction workers, many of whom were also Jewish. Later, because of the railway, some of these homesteads grew into prosperous towns. At this time, Canadian Jews also had important roles in developing the west coast fishing industry, while others worked on building telegraph lines. Some, descended from the earliest Canadian Jews, stayed true to their ancestors as fur trappers. The first major Jewish organization to appear was B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. Till today B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Canada is the community&#x27;s independent advocacy and social service organization. Also at this time, the Montreal branch of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle was founded in 1907. This group was an offshoot of the Jewish Labour Bund, an outlawed party in Russia&#x27;s Pale of Settlement. It was an organization for The Main&#x27;s radical, non-Communist, non-religious, working class.

=== Organization ===

By the outbreak of World War I, there were approximately 100,000 Canadian Jews, of whom three-quarters lived in either Montreal or Toronto. Many of the children of the European refugees started out as peddlers, eventually working their way up to established businesses, such as retailers and wholesalers. Jewish Canadians played an essential role in the development of the Canadian clothing and textile industry. Most worked as labourers in sweatshops; while some owned the manufacturing facilities. Jewish merchants and labourers spread out from the cities to small towns, building synagogues, community centres and schools as they went.

As the population grew, Canadian Jews began to organize themselves as a community despite the presence of dozens of competing sects. The Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) was founded in 1919 as the result of the merger of several smaller organizations. The purpose of the CJC was to speak on behalf of the common interests of Jewish Canadians and assist immigrant Jews. The largest Jewish community was in Montreal, at the time the largest, wealthiest and most cosmopolitan city in Canada. The vast majority of Montreal&#x27;s Jews who arrived in the early 20th century were Yiddish-speaking &quot;Ashkenazim&quot; but their children chose speak English rather than French. Until 1964, Quebec had no public education system, instead having two parallel educational systems run by the Protestant churches and the Catholic church. As the Jewish community was too poor to fund its own educational system, most Jewish parents chose to enrol their children in the English-speaking Protestant school system, which was willing to accept Jews unlike the Catholic school system. The CJC had its headquarters in Montreal while the Jewish Public Library of Montreal and the Montreal Yiddish Theatre were two of the largest Jewish cultural institutions in Canada. The Jews of Montreal tended to be concentrated in several neighbourhoods, which gave a strong sense of community identity.

In 1930 under the impact of the Great Depression, Canada sharply limited immigration from Eastern Europe, which adversely impacted on the ability of the  &quot;Ashkenazim&quot; to come to Canada. In a climate of anti-semitism where the Jewish immigrants were seen as economic competition for Gentiles, the leadership of the CJC was assumed by the whisky tycoon Samuel Bronfman who it was hoped might be able to persuade the government to allow more Jews to come. In view of worsening situation for Jews in Europe, allowing more Jewish immigration became the central concern of the CJC. Through many Canadian Jews voted for the Liberal Party, traditionally seen as the friend of minorities, the Liberal Prime Minister from 1935 onward, William Lyon Mackenzie King, proved to be extremely unsympathetic. Mackenzie King adamantly refused to change the immigration law, and Canada accepted proportionally the fewest Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany.

==World War II (1939–1945)==

About 17,000 Jewish Canadians served in the Canadian Armed Forces during World War II. Major Ben Dunkelman of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles regiment was a soldier in the campaigns of 1944–45 in northwest Europe, highly decorated for his courage and ability under fire. In 1943, Saidye Rosner Bronfman of Montreal, the wife of the whiskey tycoon Samuel Bronfman was appointed MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) for her work on the home front. Saidye Bronfram had organized 7, 000 women in Montreal to make packages for Canadian soldiers serving overseas, for which she was recognized by King George VI.  Most Jewish Canadian who joined the Armed Forces at this time became members of the Royal Canadian Air Force.

In 1939, Canada turned away the MS &quot;St. Louis&quot; with 908 Jewish refugees aboard. It went back to Europe where 254 of them died in concentration camps. And overall, Canada only accepted 5,000 Jewish refugees during the 1930s and 1940s in a climate of widespread anti-Semitism. A most striking display of antisemitism occurred with the 1944 Quebec election. The leader of the &quot;Union Nationale&quot;, Maurice Duplessis appealed to anti-Semitic prejudices in Quebec in a violently anti-Semitic speech by claiming that the Dominion government of William Lyon Mackenzie King together with Liberal Premier Adélard Godbout of Quebec had secretly made an agreement with the &quot;International Zionist Brotherhood&quot; to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees left homeless by the Holocaust in Quebec after the war in exchange for the &quot;International Zionist Brotherhood&quot; promising to fund both the federal and provincial Liberal parties. By contrast, Duplessis claimed that he would never take any money from the Jews, and if he were elected Premier, he would stop this alleged plan to bring Jewish refugees to Quebec. Though Duplessis&#x27; claims about the alleged plan to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees in Quebec was entirely false, his story was widely believed in Quebec, and ensured he won the election.

In 1945, several organizations merged to form the left-wing United Jewish Peoples&#x27; Order which was one of the largest Jewish fraternal organizations in Canada for a number of years.

As in the United States, the community&#x27;s response to news of the Holocaust was muted for decades. Bialystok (2000) wrote that in the 1950s the community was &quot;virtually devoid&quot; of discussion. Although one in seven Canadian Jews were survivors or their children, most &quot;did not want to know what happened, and few survivors had the courage to tell them&quot;. He argued that the main obstacle to discussion was &quot;an inability to comprehend the event&quot;. Awareness emerged in the 1960s, as the community realized that antisemitism remained.

==Post war (1945–1997)==
From the 1940s to the 1960s, the man generally recognized as the chief spokesman for the Canadian Jewish community was Rabbi Abraham Feinberg of the Holy Blossom Temple in Toronto. In 1950, Dorothy Sangster wrote in &quot;Macleans&quot;&#x27; about him: &quot;Today American-born Rabbi Feinberg is one of the most controversial figures to occupy a Canadian pulpit. Gentiles recognize him as the official voice of Canadian Jewry. This fact was aptly demonstrated a few years ago when Montreal&#x27;s Mayor Houde introduced him to friends as &quot;Le Cardinal des Juifs&quot;—the Cardinal of the Jews&quot;. Feinberg was very active in various social justice efforts, campaigning for laws against discrimination against minorities and to end the &quot;restrictive covenants&quot;.

In March 1945, Rabbi Feinberg wrote an article in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; charging that there was rampant antisemitism in Canada, stating: &quot;Jews are kept out of most ski clubs. Sundry summer colonies (even on municipally owned land), fraternities, and at least one Rotary Club operate under written or unwritten “Gentiles Only” signs. Many bank positions are not open to Jews. Only three Jewish male physicians have been admitted to non-Jewish Hospital staffs in Toronto. McGill University has instituted a rule requiring in effect at least a 10% higher academic average for Jewish applicants; in certain schools of the University of Toronto anti-Jewish bias is being felt. City Councils debate whether Jewish petitioners should be permitted to build a synagogue; property deeds in some areas bar resale to them. I have seen crude handbills circulated thanking Hitler for his massacre of 80,000 Jews in Kiev.&quot;

In 1945, in the Re Drummond Wren case, a Jewish group, the Workers&#x27; Education Association (WEA) challenged the &quot;restrictive covenants&quot; that forbade the renting or selling of properties to Jews. Through the case was something of a set-up as the WEA had quite consciously purchased a property in Toronto known to have a &quot;restrictive covenant&quot; in order to challenge the legality of &quot;restrictive covenants&quot; in the courts, Justice John Keiller MacKay struck down &quot;restrictive covenants&quot; in his ruling on October 31, 1945. In 1948, MacKay&#x27;s ruling in the Drummond Wren case was struck down in the Noble v Alley case by the Ontario Supreme Court, which ruled that &quot;restrictive covenants&quot; were &quot;legal and enforceable&quot;. A woman named Anna Noble decided to sell her cottage at the Beach O&#x27; Pines resort to Bernard Wolf, a Jewish businessman from London, Ontario. The sale was blocked by the Beach O&#x27;Pines Resort Association which had a &quot;restrictive covenant&quot; forbidding the sale of cottages to any person of &quot;Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or colored race or blood&quot;. With the support of the Joint Public Relations Committee of the Canadian Jewish Congress and B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith headed by Rabbi Feinberg, the Noble ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which in November 1950 ruled against &quot;restrictive covenants&quot;, albeit only on the technicality that the phrase &quot;Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or colored race or blood&quot; was too vague.

After the war, Canada liberalized its immigration policy. Roughly 40,000 Holocaust Survivors came during the late 1940s, hoping to rebuild their shattered lives. In 1947, the Workmen&#x27;s Circle and Jewish Labour Committee started a project, spearheaded by Kalmen Kaplansky and Moshe Lewis, to bring Jewish refugees to Montreal in the needle trades, called the Tailors Project. They were able to do this through the federal government&#x27;s &quot;bulk-labour&quot; program that allowed labour-intensive industries to bring European displaced persons to Canada, to fill those jobs. For Lewis&#x27; work on this and other projects during this period, the Montreal branch was renamed the Moshe Lewis Branch, after his death in 1950. The Canadian arm of the Jewish Labor Committee also honored him when they established the Moshe Lewis Foundation in 1975.

In the post-war era, universities proved more willing to accept Jewish applicants and in decades after 1945, many Canadian Jews tended to move up from a lower-class group working as menial laborers to a middle class group working as &quot;bourgeois&quot; professionals. With the ability to obtain a better education, many Jews become doctors, teachers, lawyers, dentists, accountants, professors and other &quot;bourgeois&quot; occupations. Geographically, there was a tendency for many Jews living in the inner cities of Toronto and Montreal to move out to the suburbs. The rural Jewish communities almost vanished as Jews living in rural areas decamped to the cities. Reflecting a more tolerant attitude, Canadian Jews became active on the cultural scene. In the post-war decades Peter C. Newman, Wayne and Shuster, Mordecai Richler, Leonard Cohen, Barbara Frum, Joseph Rosenblatt, Irving Layton, Eli Mandel, A.M. Klein, Henry Kreisel, Adele Wiseman, Miriam Waddington, Naim Kattan, and Rabbi Stuart Rosenberg were individuals of note in the fields of arts, journalism and literature.  

Since the 1960s a new immigration wave of Jews started to take place. A number of French-speaking Jews from North Africa ended up settling in Montreal. Some South African Jews decided to emigrate to Canada after South Africa became a republic in 1961, and was followed by another wave in the late 1970s, which was precipitated by anti-apartheid rioting and civil unrest. The majority of them settled in Ontario, with the largest community in Toronto, followed by those in Hamilton, London and Kingston. Smaller waves of Zimbabwean Jews were also present during this period.

In 1961 Louis Rasminsky became the first Jewish governor of the Bank of Canada. Every previous governor of the Bank of Canada had been a member of the prestigious Rideau Club of Ottawa, but Rasminsky&#x27;s application to join the Rideau Club was turned down on the account of his religion, a rejection that deeply hurt him. Through the Rideau Club changed its policies in response to public criticism, Rasminsky only joined the club after he retired as bank governor in 1973. In 1968, the Liberal MP Herb Gray of Windsor became the Jewish federal cabinet minister. In 1970, Bora Laskin became the first Jewish justice of the Supreme Court of Canada and in 1973, the first Jewish Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. In 1971, David Lewis became the leader of the New Democratic Party, becoming the first Jew to head a major Canadian political party.

In 1976, the Quebec provincial election was won by the separatist &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; (PQ), which sparked a major flight of Montreal&#x27;s English-speaking Jews to Toronto with about 20,000 leaving. The Jewish community of Montreal has been a bastion of federalism, and Quebec separatists, with their goal of creating a nation-state for French-Canadians, have tended to be hostile to Jews. In both the 1980 and 1995 referendums, Montreal&#x27;s Jews voted overwhelmingly for Quebec to remain in Canada.

It was official Canadian policy after 1945 to accept immigrants from Eastern Europe as long they were anti-communist even if they had fought for Nazi Germany. For an example the veterans of the 14th Waffen SS Division &quot;Galizien&quot;, which was mostly recruited from Ukrainians in Galicia, settled in Canada. The fact that the men of the 14th Waffen-SS division had committed war crimes was ignored because they were felt to be useful for the Cold War. In Oakville, Ontario, a public monument honors the men of the 14th SS Division as heroes. Starting in the 1980s, Jewish groups began to lobby the Canadian government to deport the Axis collaborators from Eastern Europe whom the government of Canada had welcomed with open arms in the 1940s–1950s. In 1997, a report by Sol Littman, the head of Simon Wiesenthal Center operations in Canada charged that Canada in 1950 had accepted 2,000 veterans of 14th Waffen-SS Division with no screening; the American news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; showed that Canada had allowed about 1,000 SS veterans from the Baltic states to become Canadian citizens; and the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; called Canada a &quot;near-blissful refuge&quot; for Nazi war criminals. The Canadian Jewish historian Irving Abella stated that for Eastern Europeans the best way of getting into postwar Canada &quot;was by showing the SS tattoo. This proved that you were an anti-Communist&quot;. Despite pressure from Jewish groups, the Canadian government dragged its feet on deporting Nazi war criminals out of the fear of offending voters of Eastern European background, who make up a significant number of Canadian voters.

==Modernity (since 2001)==
Today, the Jewish culture in Canada is maintained by practising Jews and secular Jews. Nearly all Jews in Canada speak one of the two official languages, although most speak English over French. Most Ashkenazi Jews speak English as a first language, including most Ashkenazi Jews in Quebec.

In terms of Jewish denominations, 26% of Canadian Jews are Conservative, 17% Orthodox, 16% Reform, 29% are &quot;Just Jewish&quot;, and the remaining 12% align themselves with smaller movements or are unsure. Intermarriage is relatively low among Canadian Jews, with 77% of married Jews having a Jewish spouse.

Most of Canada&#x27;s Jews live in Ontario and Quebec, followed by British Columbia, Manitoba and Alberta. While Toronto currently contains the largest Jewish community, Montreal held this position until the 1970s, when many English-speaking Jewish Canadians left for Toronto, fearing that Quebec might leave the federation following the rise of nationalist political parties, as well as a result of Quebec&#x27;s Language Law.
The Jewish population is growing rather slowly due to aging and low birth rates. The population of Canadian Jews increased by just 3.5% between 1991 and 2001, despite much immigration from the former Soviet Union, Israel, and other countries.

Politically, the major Jewish Canadian organizations are the Centre for Israel and Jewish Advocacy (CIJA) and the more conservative B&#x27;nai Brith Canada both claim to be the voice of the Jewish community. The United Jewish People&#x27;s Order, once the largest Jewish fraternal organization in Canada, is a left-leaning secular group established in 1927 with current chapters in Toronto, Hamilton, Winnipeg and Vancouver. Politically, UJPO opposes the Israeli Occupation and advocate for a two-state solution but focus primarily on Jewish cultural, educational and social justice issues. A smaller organization, Independent Jewish Voices (Canada), characterized as anti-Zionist, argues that the CIJA and B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith do not speak for most Canadian Jews. Also, many Canadian Jews simply have no connections to any of these organizations.

The birth rate for Jews in Canada is much higher than that in the United States, with a TFR of 1.91 according to the 2001 Census. This is due to the presence of large numbers of Orthodox Jews in Canada. According to the census, the Jewish birth rate and TFR is higher than that of Christian (1.35), Buddhist (1.34), Non-Religious (1.41), and Sikh (1.9) populations, but slightly lower than that of Hindus (2.05), and Muslims (2.01).

In the 21st century, anti-Semitism has become a growing concern, with reports of anti-Semitic incidents increasing sharply in recent years. This includes the well publicized anti-Semitic comments of Ernst Zündel. In 2009, the Canadian Parliamentary Coalition to Combat Antisemitism was established by all four major federal political parties to investigate and combat antisemitism, namely new antisemitism. The League for Human Rights of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith monitors the incidents and prepares an annual audit of these events. There was an increase of the scope of anti-Semitic incidents in Canada with a number of cases of anti-Semitic vandalism and spraying Nazi symbols in August 2013 in Winnipeg and in the greater Toronto area.

On February 26, 2014, and for the first time in Canadian history, B&#x27;nai Brith Canada led an official delegation of Sephardi community leaders, activists, philanthropists and spiritual leaders from across the country visiting Parliament Hill and meeting with the prime minister, ambassadors and other dignitaries.

Since the beginning of the 21st century Jewish immigration to Canada has continued, increasing in numbers with the passing of the years. With the rise of antisemitic acts in France and weak economic conditions, most of the Jewish newcomers are French Jews who are mainly looking for new economic opportunities (either in Israel or elsewhere, with Canada one of the top destinations chosen by French Jews to live in, particularly in Quebec). For the same reasons, and due to cultural and linguistic proximity, several members of the Belgian-Jewish community choose Canada as their new home. There are efforts by the Jewish community of Montreal to attract these immigrants and make them feel at home, as well as those from other parts of the world. There is also some immigration of Argentine Jews and from other parts of Latin America. Argentina is home to the largest Jewish community in Latin America and the third largest in the Americas after the United States and Canada.

A population of Israeli Jews emigrate to Canada to study and work. The Israeli Canadian community is growing and it is one of the largest Israeli diaspora groups with an estimated 30,000 people. A small proportion of Israeli Jews who come to Canada are Ethiopian Jews.

=== Afghan Jews ===
Following the Fall of Kabul in August 2021, the final Afghan Jew still in Afghanistan, Tova Moradi, fled to Canada. This marked the end of Afghanistan&#x27;s 2,700-year Jewish history.

=== Yiddish ===
Yiddish () is the historical and cultural language of Ashkenazi Jews, who make up the majority of the Canadian Jewry and was widely spoken within the Canadian Jewish community up to the middle of the twentieth century.

Montreal had and to some extent still has one of the most thriving Yiddish communities in North America. Yiddish was Montreal&#x27;s third language (after French and English) for the entire first half of the 20th century. The Kanader Adler (The Canadian Eagle), Montreal&#x27;s daily Yiddish newspaper founded by Hirsch Wolofsky, appeared from 1907 to 1988. The Monument National was the centre of Yiddish theatre from 1896 until the construction of the Saidye Bronfman Centre for the Arts, inaugurated on September 24, 1967, where the established resident theatre, the Dora Wasserman Yiddish Theatre, remains the only permanent Yiddish theatre in North America. The theatre group also tours Canada, US, Israel, and Europe. In 1931, 99% of Montreal Jews stated that Yiddish was their mother language. In the 1930s there was a Yiddish language education system and a Yiddish newspaper in Montreal. In 1938, most Jewish households in Montreal primarily used English and often used French and Yiddish. 9% of the Jewish households only used French and 6% only used Yiddish.

In 1980 Chaim Leib Fox published &quot;Hundert yor yidishe un hebreyishe literatur in Kanade&quot; (&quot;One Hundred Years of Yiddish and Hebrew Literature in Canada&quot;) – a compendium on the history of literature and culture of the Jewish diaspora in Canada. The comprehensive volume covered 429 Yiddish and Hebrew authors who published in Canada in 1870–1970. According to Vivian Felsen, it was &quot;the most ambitious attempt to preserve Yiddish culture in Canada.&quot;

=== Press ===

The Canadian Jewish News was, until April 2020, Canada&#x27;s most widely-read Jewish community newspaper. It had suffered from financial shortfalls for years, which were exacerbated by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in Canada on its finances. CJN president Elizabeth Wolfe stated that &quot;The CJN suffered from a pre-existing condition and has been felled by COVID-19.&quot;

Shortly thereafter, two new Jewish community newspapers made their debuts, with the Canadian Jewish Record and TheJ.ca beginning publication in May 2020. These two papers sought to fill the void left by the CJN, but unlike the CJN, had politically partisan editorial stances. The left-leaning Canadian Jewish Record was noted by its CEO as &quot;not an anti-Zionist outlet, but rather that the newspaper will periodically provide legitimate criticism of the State of Israel. TheJ.ca, by contrast, has emphasized that its stance on the question of Israel is right-leaning, with staff journalist and co-founder Dave Gordon saying &quot;we’re very pro-Israel, very Zionistic [sic] …&quot; while Ron East, a publisher of TheJ.ca, has voiced opposition to progressive Jewish activism, claiming that right-wing Zionist viewpoints are &quot;drowned out,&quot; thereby necessitating &quot;a platform that would allow for those voices&quot;.

In May 2021, the Canadian Jewish News relaunched as a digital-only publication at &quot;thecjn.ca&quot;. In December 2020, the Canadian Jewish Record announcing it would end its run with a post titled &quot;A Note from the Publisher: The Bridge is Now Completed&quot;, stating that it had intended &quot;to be a bridge between the recently shuttered Canadian Jewish News and its hoped-for return,&quot; and given that the CJN had managed to relaunch, it (The Canadian Jewish Record) would cease publication. The CJN resumed its journalistic reporting, and now also hosts an email newsletter, as well as several weekly podcasts.

=== Museums and monuments ===
Canada has several Jewish museums and monuments, which focus upon Jewish culture and Jewish history.

==Socioeconomics==
===Education===
There are numerous Jewish day schools throughout the country, as well as a number of Yeshivot. In Toronto, around 40% of Jewish children attend Jewish elementary schools and 12% go to Jewish high schools. The figures for Montreal are higher: 60% and 30%, respectively. The national average for attendance at Jewish elementary schools is at least 55%.

The Jewish community in Canada is among the country&#x27;s most educated groups. In 1991, four out of ten doctors and dentists in Toronto were Jewish and nationally, four times as many Jews completed graduate degrees as Canadians generally. In the same study, it was found that 43% of Jewish Canadians had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher while the comparable figure for persons of British origin is 19% and just 16% for the general Canadian population as a whole.

In 2016, 80% of Canadian Jewish adults aged 25–64 had a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree while only 29% of the general Canadian population did. An additional 37% of Canadian Jews in this age range had post-graduate or professional degrees.

Jewish Canadians comprise approximately one percent of the Canadian population, but make up a significantly larger percentage of the student body of some of the most prestigious universities in Canada.
===Employment===
Before the mass Jewish immigration of the 1880s, the Canadian Jewish community was relatively affluent compared to other ethnic groups in Canada, a distinguishable feature that still continues on to this day. During the 18th and the 19th centuries, upper class Jews tended to be fur traders, merchants, and entrepreneurs.

At the turn of the 20th century, most Jewish heads of household were self-employed wholesalers, retailers, or peddlers, though large numbers of Jews began to enter the blue-collar labour force in the early 1900s and 1910s, particularly in the garment sector. By 1915, half the Toronto Jewish community was self-employed, and divided the other were blue-collar workers employed, mostly by non-Jews, in the secondary segment of the labor market. By the early 1930s, there were approximately 400 Jewish-owned garment shops and factories in Toronto, and white Anglo-Saxon manufacturers&#x27; control on this sector was no longer total. Geographer Daniel Hiebert wrote that &quot;Jewish entrepreneurs were successful because they could rely upon resources within their ethnic group, such as the large number of Jewish-owned clothing retail stores and, more particularly, the presence of a skilled co-ethnic labor force.&quot; In 1930, fully half of all Canadians working in pawn-shops were Jewish. That year, only 2.2% of Jews were working in law or medicine (though this was double the overall Canadian rate of 1.1%).

Canadian Jews&#x27; participation in labour and trade union activism through the 1940s and into midcentury is noteworthy. The Canadian Jewish Labour Committee, whose membership peaked at 50,000, represented trade unions with a large Jewish membership, including the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers’ Union, and the United Cap, Hat and Millinery Workers’ Union. Following WWII, Jewish Canadians turned their attention to combating structural antisemitism in the employment: many Canadian universities, boardrooms, banks, educational institutions, professional associations and businesses discriminated against Jewish applicants, or restricted participation and advancement through quotas as a matter of policy.

In the early 1950s, popular support for anti-discrimination legislation increased, and by the 1960s, multiple provinces had created human rights commissions and enacted legislation proscribing discrimination on the basis of race or religion in employment, enabling Jews to participate more fully in a variety of sectors and industries.

It became possible for Jewish lawyers to practice law outside their community beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, ultimately resulting in a considerable increase in the number of Jewish lawyers employed in large Canadian law firms in the 1990s. A 1960 study found that although 40% of Jews had grades in the top 10% of their class, only 8% of Jewish lawyers surveyed were employed in large law firms, which resulted in lower wages. By the 1990s, the numbers of Jews and non-Jews employed in large firms had more or less equalized.

===Economics===
According to a 2018 study of the Canadian Jewish community by the Environics Institute for Survey Research, annual household income was reported as follows:
====Wealth====

The majority of Canadian Jews fall into the middle class (defined as an income between $45,000 and $120,000) or upper-middle class. Some of the wealthiest Canadian Jewish families include the Bronfmans, the Belzbergs, the Diamonds, the Reichmanns, and the Shermans. Canadian Jews comprise roughly 17% of Canadian Business&#x27;s list of the 100 Richest Canadians.

====Poverty====
As of 2015, the median income among Canadian Jews over the age of 15 years is $30,670, and 14.6% of Canadian Jews live below the poverty line, with poverty concentrated among Jews in the Toronto area. (By comparison, the percentage of non-Jewish Canadians living below the poverty line is 14.8%.) Slightly more Jewish women than Jewish men live in poverty, and poverty is most concentrated among Canadian Jews ages 15–24 and those over the age of 65. There is a strong correlation with level of education attained, with poverty most concentrated among Canadian Jews who had only a secondary education, and the lowest levels of poverty among those who had attained a postgraduate degree.

<text>A vetala () is a class of beings in Hindu mythology. They are usually defined as a knowledgeable (fortune telling) paranormal entity said to be dwelling at charnel grounds. Reanimated corpses are used as vehicles by these spirits for movement. A vetala may possess and leave a dead body at will.

==Description==
In Hindu folklore, the vetala is an evil spirit who haunts cemeteries and takes demonic possession of corpses. They make their displeasure known by troubling humans. They can drive people mad, kill children, and cause miscarriages, but also guard villages.

They are hostile spirits of the dead trapped in the &#x27;twilight zone&#x27; between life and afterlife. These creatures can be repelled by the chanting of mantras. One can free them from their ghostly existence by performing their funerary rites. Being unaffected by the laws of space and time, they have an uncanny knowledge about the past, present, and future and a deep insight into human nature. Therefore many sorcerers seek to capture them and turn them into slaves.

There is also a strong Vetala cult in the Konkan region, under the names of Betal, Vetal, Vetoba. Since Betal is said to be the husband of the goddess Shantadurga, there will be a temple dedicated in honour of Betal either within the temple complex of Shantadurga or somewhere in the sylvan surroundings. There is a Betal temple in Amona, Goa. Betal is a form of Bhairava and is the head of all spirits and ghouls and vampires and all kinds of pisachas.

==Literature==
The Vetala Panchavimshati is a collection of twenty-five stories, featuring a vetala as one of the two central characters. It is a part of the Kathasaritsagara, a work that was compiled no later than the 11th century. It features a frame story of a sorcerer who asks King Vikramaditya to capture a corpse hanging on a tree that stands in the middle of a cremation ground. The corpse is possessed by a vetala, who proposes to tell the king a story along the journey. After the vetala finishes the story, he would ask the king a question, which he would have to answer. After Vikramaditya answers the question, the vetala would return to the tree, the corpse hanging upon it once more. This event occurs twenty-four times, after which the king is unable to answer the question posed by the vetala. Impressed with the king, the vetala informs him of the evil designs of the sorcerer, and grants him a gift that would allow him to acquire the powers of witchcraft and defeat the sorcerer.

== In popular culture ==

&quot;Vikram Vetal&quot;, a 1986 Indian fantasy film directed by Shantilal Soni was based on the &quot;Baital Pachisi&quot; about King Vikramaditya and the Vetala.

&quot;Vikram Aur Betaal&quot; was a television programme based on the &quot;Baital Pachisi&quot; produced by Ramanand Sagar and directed by his son Prem Sagar that aired on DD National channel. It was remade as &quot;Kahaniya Vikram aur Betaal Ki&quot; in 2009 and aired on Colors TV. &quot;Vikram Betaal Ki Rahasya Gatha&quot; (2018), an Indian mythological serial based on &quot;Baital Pachisi&quot; aired on &amp;TV. Indian animator Rajiv Chilaka directed &quot;Vikram Betal&quot;, a television film for Cartoon Network in 2004 which was produced by his Green Gold Animations. &quot;Vicky &amp; Vetaal&quot; (2006–2007) and &quot;Vicky Aur Vetaal&quot; (2015–2016), which aired on Disney Channel India, also featured Vetala as the main character.

<text>A. J. Croce is the debut album by American singer-songwriter A. J. Croce, released in 1993.

==Background==
Croce was 21 years old when he made the debut album. The album was a result of his performance inducting his father, singer-songwriter Jim Croce, into the Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame. His record label, Private Music decided they wouldn&#x27;t mount a campaign for a particular single from the album, instead they decided to let radio programmers listen to the entire album and decide for themselves what they wanted to play on the air. Croce said the feedback was &quot;surprisingly supportive&quot;.

The album featured heavyweights from the music industry including; producer John Simon, guitarist and songwriter T Bone Burnett, drummer Jim Keltner, guitarist Robben Ford and keyboardist Benmont Tench. The album entered the top ten U.S. jazz chart in 1993.

==Reception==
&quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; said his debut album &quot;covers acres, as much a tribute to the New Orleans piano masters, the Memphis soul sound, and the Basie-era Kansas City scene as it is a showcase for the artist&#x27;s impressive songwriting, vocal, and piano playing talents&quot;. They also praised the &quot;all-star cast&quot; of players, saying; &quot;together they pulled off a project that in lesser hands would be overambitious&quot;.

Graham Coxon wrote in &quot;Guitar Player&quot; that &quot;Croce masterfully writes and performs songs reminiscent of &#x27;30s jazz, &#x27;40s jump blues, and late &#x27;60s New Orleans R&amp;B, while the supporting musicians provide authentic period feel without sounding dated&quot;. Overall, he opined it was &quot;refreshing music that eases the mind and soothes the soul&quot;.

Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said the album &quot;showcases his flair for low-key, atmospheric blues. As a performer, he&#x27;s surprisingly confident and assured. As a songwriter, he still relies a little too heavily on cliches, but the best songs show potential, and that&#x27;s what makes A.J. Croce a winning debut&quot;.

<doc id="1246931" wikidata="Q1160302" url="?curid=1246931" title="HC Dynamo Moscow">
<text>HC Dynamo Moscow () is a Russian professional ice hockey club based in Moscow. It is a member of the Tarasov Division in the Kontinental Hockey League.

Dynamo has won the Gagarin Cup twice, in 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, and have won the regular season championship once, in 2013–14, winning the Continental Cup.

The club is one of the most successful teams in Russia.

==History==
The team was founded in 1946 and belonged the Dynamo Moscow sports club, a part of Dynamo sports society sponsored by the Soviet Ministry of Interior and the national security structures including the KGB. It won the first Soviet hockey championship in 1946–47, beating Spartak Moscow in the finals. Helmed by Arkady Chernyshev during the first decades of its history, Dynamo established itself as one of the top teams of the Soviet hockey league. Throughout the Soviet era, Dynamo was among the top three teams almost every season, winning five championships and three USSR Cups. The last years of the Soviet hockey championship and the beginning of the IHL period were marked with Dynamo winning fours seasons in a row and ending CSKA Moscow&#x27;s dominance that had lasted for decades.

===Merger with HC MVD===
In 2010, Dynamo Moscow merged with HC MVD, a KHL team from Balashikha owned by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). The team continued the history of the Dynamo club, with the majority of its roster and executives from HC MVD. The new club was officially called &quot;United Hockey Club (UHC) Dynamo Moscow&quot;, and for one season the new club was referred to as &quot;UHC Dynamo&quot;, then for a couple years as &quot;UHC Dynamo Moscow&quot;, but in 2012 the official name of the club was reverted to &quot;Hockey Club Dynamo Moscow&quot;.

In 2013 Dynamo Moscow had tried to recruit Alexander Ovechkin who played for them from 2001 to 2005, but switched to the Washington Capitals soon after.

===Debt problems/KHL sanctions===
Under the guidance of director and president, Andrei Safronov, HC Dynamo was reported to have amassed a debt of 2 billion rubles (US$33 million) following the 2016–17 season. With concerns from the governing body of the KHL, Dynamo were ordered to give a presentation as to how they would be funded in the following season on 24 May 2017.

As a branch of the Dynamo Moscow sporting club, the parent company board opted to remove Safronov, citing a breach of trust with sponsors and took control of the hockey club. Dynamo then refused to pay back the debt, citing it wasn&#x27;t their responsibility, putting the onus on former CEO Safronov to repay the debt due to his mismanagement. With allegations of embezzlement, HC Dynamo&#x27;s offices were raided by police in order to retrieve accounting documentation on 2 June 2017. With the players having not been paid in three months, former HC Dynamo board led by Safronov declared bankruptcy in order to escape the debt.

On 4 July 2017, at a KHL board meeting, the Disciplinary Committee took action with Dynamo&#x27;s failure to meet contractual obligations by declaring all 42 players under contract with Dynamo as free agents.

<doc id="1246937" wikidata="Q2542211" url="?curid=1246937" title="Demon City Shinjuku">
<text>is a novel by Hideyuki Kikuchi that was adapted into an original video animation (OVA) in 1988, directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. The title has also been translated as &quot;Hell City Shinjuku&quot; and &quot;Monster City&quot;. It was also released as two manga by ADV Manga in 2003 and 2004. The novel was also released in English in 2011 by Digital Manga Publishing, compiled with its sequel &quot;Demon Palace Babylon&quot;.

The film was released in North America by Central Park Media in 1994. Portions of the opening fight scene were featured in the 1995 cyberpunk film &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;Demon City Shinjuku&quot; begins with a battle between former friends, the evil Rebi Ra (also pronounced Levi Ra) versus the short-lived hero Genichirou. Rebi Ra has allowed himself to be possessed in order to gain the incredible powers of evil and plans to summon demons to conquer the world. Defeating Genichirou and destroying Shinjuku, a part of Tokyo, with a devastating earthquake, the area becomes a demon-haunted wilderness. The novel doesn&#x27;t have a fight scene between Genichirou and Rebi Ra. It opens with a quiet time in Shinjuku and then in a sudden change the Demon Quake hits only Shinjuku.

Ten years later, the World President, put in place to uphold world peace, is attacked by Rebi Ra with cursed plants indirectly to keep his old master, Aguni Rai, as the protector of the president, occupied. However, Rebi Ra did not know that Genichirou had a son who inherited his powers and more. After an emotional plea from the president&#x27;s daughter, Sayaka Rama, the unlikely hero Kyoya Izayoi follows her deep into the heart of the evil city, finding new allies and terrifying enemies along the way. In the novel Aguni Rai asks the Information Bureau Japan Section Chief to look for Kyoya as the only one who could stop Rebi Ra.

The Section Chief tests Kyoya with a commando cyborg and then relates to Kyoya that the president is in a life-threatening curse and only has three days to defeat Rebi Ra before the president is killed as the ritual sacrifice to bring the Demon Realm to Earth, which he failed to do years prior, causing the Demon Quake. During the course of explanation Aguni Rai uses a doppelganger to communicate to Kyoya from New York in hopes of convincing him to save the world. Sayaka soon enters and pleads with him to do so as well. Kyoya finally decides to help because of Sayaka&#x27;s pleas.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film took two years to produce and had a budget of 130 million yen. It was also additionally screened in movie theaters in Hong Kong.

==Reception==
&quot;Hyper&quot; Daniel Wilks criticised the film for having &quot;only vaguely interconnected action scenes punctuated by some rather dull talkiness marred by horrible accents (the heroine is unconvincingly British and the childish sidekick speaks with a mangled Mexican drawl)&quot;.

==Related works==
&quot;Demon Palace Babylon&quot; is the direct sequel to &quot;Demon City Shinjuku&quot; written six years later in 1988 and follows Kyoya, Sayaka, and Mephisto as they battle against King Nebachanezzar and his four knights. This was released in the United States in a complete edition with &quot;Demon City&quot; in 2011. It was also released as two manga by ADV Manga back in 2003 and 2004. 7 novels have been published in Japan as of 2017.

&quot;Demon City Hunter&quot; is a series of 17 manga released in Japan that follows Kyoya, Mephisto, and Sayaka after the events of &quot;Demon City Shinjuku&quot;. ADV Manga published two of these in English but did not finish them.

&quot;Demon City Blues&quot; is a set of five novels that is based in the Demon City universe and has Mephisto reappearing but with a new hero, Setsura Aki. Setsura is a P.I. specializing in missing persons, but now he and Mephisto must go up against a group of vampires led by &quot;Princess&quot; who plan on making Shinjuku a vampire metropolis. The last novel will be released in English in March.

The &quot;Demon City Shinjuku Role-Playing Game&quot; was published by Guardians of Order in 2000. It uses the Tri-Stat System and was written by David L. Pulver.

<text>John Tatham (fl. 1632–1664) was an English dramatist of the mid-17th century. He was a strong Cavalier.

==Hatreds==
Little is known of Tatham personally. He was a Cavalier, with a hatred of the Puritans and of the Scots – he went so far as to invent a dialect that he claimed was the Scots vernacular.

==Poems and stage works==
&quot;Fancy&#x27;s Theatre&quot;, a collection of his poems, was published in 1640. It included an elegy on the dramatist John Day. In the years 1657–64, Tatham produced eight pageants for the annual London Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show, seven of which were entitled &quot;London&#x27;s Triumph&quot;). He also wrote &quot;London&#x27;s Glory&quot;, an entertainment to celebrate the return of King Charles II to London at the Restoration. This was performed on 5 July 1660.

Among the known plays by John Tatham are:
*&quot;Love Crowns the End&quot; (1632; printed 1646)
*&quot;The Distracted State&quot; (1641; printed 1651)
*&quot;The Scots Figgaries, or a Knot of Knaves&quot; (printed 1652)
*&quot;The Rump&quot; (printed 1660).

==Legacy==
In 1682, Aphra Behn adapted &quot;The Rump&quot; as a play of her own, &quot;The Roundheads&quot;.

<doc id="1246941" wikidata="Q619454" url="?curid=1246941" title="Mannlicher M1901">
<text>The M1901 Mannlicher Self-Loading, Semi-Automatic Pistol was an early semi-automatic pistol design. The Bundeswehr Museum of German Defense Technology in Koblenz has one of these specimen in its collection.

==General features==
This pistol is one of the most simple of blow-back semi-automatic pistols ever designed. The lockwork is essentially that of an elementary single action revolver. While technically listed as a &#x27;hesitation&#x27; lock because of a delaying cam which has some theoretical tendency to slow down the opening of the breech, in actual practice it functions as an unlocked pistol.

According to the Steyr factory records this arm, patented in 1898, was originally introduced as the &quot;Model 1900&quot; and used a special 8 mm cartridge.

When introduced commercially in 1901 it was chambered for a special straight-case cartridge listed in Austria as &quot;7.63 mm Mannlicher&quot;, designated in Germany as &quot;7.65mm Mannlicher&quot; (Note: There is also another 7.65 mm Mannlincher cartridge, M.1903, similar to 7.65 mm Borchardt), and described in the U.S. as &quot;7.65 x 21 mm&quot;. The Mannlicher &quot;straight sided&quot; cartridge actually has a straight taper to help in extraction.

The cartridge for this pistol was manufactured in Europe until the beginning of WWII. The cartridge has a bullet weighing approx. 85 grains (5.5 g) which may be steel or cupro-nickel jacketed. The powder charge varies with the type of powder used, the European standard being about 3.5 grains (227 mg) of DWM standard powder, producing a muzzle velocity in the neighborhood of 1070 ft/s (326 m/s).

While this is a cartridge of considerable power to use in a blow-back action, the pistol design itself is so sturdy that it tends to be very reliable through the years.

The firing chamber in this design is part of the receiver proper. The fixed magazine is housed in the grip, and is loaded with a stripper clip through the top of the open action. Because of the extremely simple lock work employed, the pistol has a minimum bulk for an arm of its type.

==Breechblock design==
The moving breechblock of this pistol was designed as a slide with two rails extending forward beneath the stationary receiver/barrel where they are connected by a cross beam which is also part of the single breechblock forging. The barrel is screwed into the chamber section of the receiver and has a front sight top rib which is part of the barrel forging.

A spiral recoil spring is positioned horizontally, directly below the barrel between the parallel guides of the receiver and rails of the breechblock. An illustration of this spring is shown in the drawing from page 216, Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947. When the pistol is discharged, as the breechblock moves to the rear and the slide rails travel back in the receiver guides, the cross-beam at the forward end serves to compress the recoil spring against the frame.

The lockwork is incorporated on the left side of the frame where it is covered by a removable side cover housing of unusual design, being wrapped around at the forward end and serving also as a cover of the recoil spring. An illustration of this cover is shown in the below drawing from page 218 of the same work. This cover is installed on the frame from the front, and is retained by a spring catch forward of the trigger-guard.

The trigger is connected on the left side of the frame to a trigger bar, which, as the trigger is pulled, moves rearward, pushing against the sear tail, which is under the control of the V-spring that serves as both trigger spring and sear spring. The sear nose engages in a notch in the left fork of the hammer (which is external) to provide a smooth trigger pull that is very unusual in an automatic pistol.

Mounted on the frame under the right portion of the side cover housing is the mainspring, a heavy V-spring. Its greater arm (lower) engages a notch in the right fork of the hammer to drive it forward when released by the sear. Its lesser arm (upper) continuously presses a cam upward that engages a slot in the under-surface of the breechblock slide when the action is closed.

To load the pistol, the breechblock is grasped on the serrated gripping surfaces on the sides, and is pulled straight to the rear. The magazine follower rises to hold the action open, while the cross beam at the forward end of the slide compresses the recoil spring. A loaded stripper clip is inserted into the clip guide in the face of the breech block, and then the cartridges are stripped into the magazine, compressing the spring below the follower. An illustration of this process is shown in the drawing from page 214 of the above-mentioned work. The spring lip at the top of the magazine serves to hold the cartridges. The cam on the right side of the frame, being forced up by the lesser arm of the mainspring, pushes the cam into the slot in the under-surface of the breechblock slide, holding the action open.

Because of this cam hold-open, the pistol does not close when the clip is removed. However, drawing back slightly on the breechblock will ride it over the cam, and releasing it will permit the recoil spring to close the action.

As the breechblock goes forward, the extractor mounted in the top of the block will snap over the extracting groove of the cartridge as it is chambered.

==Discharging==
Movement of the trigger, linked to the trigger bar, releases the sear from the hammer notch. The compressed arm of the mainspring pushes against the hammer notch, rotating the hammer on its axis to strike the firing pin, discharging the cartridge.

The breechblock starts back at the instant of discharge, carrying the empty cartridge case with the assistance of the extractor. The empty cartridge case is brought sharply against the ejector, which is a bar at the back of the magazine. The underside of the breechblock is slotted to travel over the ejector.

The recoiling slide riding over the hammer causes the hammer to rotate on its axis, locking the sear in the notch of the left hammer fork.

The magazine spring forces the next cartridge up into line. At the apex of the recoil stroke, the recoil spring acts to reverse the direction of the breechblock, chambering the fresh cartridge. Until trigger pressure is released, another discharge is not possible.

==Magazine unload lever==
A unique feature of this pistol is the unloading device. While the breechblock is held open, pulling down on the serrated lever on the right side at the top of the grip panel will withdraw the lip which is holding the cartridges in the magazine, enabling the magazine spring to move the platform up, forcing all the cartridges out of the magazine.

==Developmental versions==


After the disappointing reception of the Mannlicher M1894, the more conventional Mannlicher M1896 appeared, externally resembling the Mauser C96. The M1896 had a fixed magazine ahead of the trigger holding six or seven cartridges. However, most production of this design was an improved M1897/01 which used a detachable six-shot magazine in the same location. Both the M1896 and M1897/01 were chambered for the 7.65×25mm Mannlicher, and both could be fed from the top with a stripper clip. Fewer than 1,000 M1896s and M1897/01s were manufactured, in several variations including a detachable shoulder stock model, a carbine version, and a trial model tested by the Swiss military.

The Mannlicher M1898 was a complete redesign, moving the magazine back, into the location of the later M1901, for loading from an 8-round stripper clip. The M1899 had a large safety lever mounted on the left side of the frame. Embellished pistols were presented to German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm, and to Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II, but production of the M1898 and M1899 was less than 350, following which the design was improved to the M1901, with its slide-mounted, hammer-blocking safety, and convenient lever lock for easier disassembly.

<text>Mazarin is the fourth studio album by Swedish pop musician Per Gessle, released on 16 June 2003.

Per Gessle thought of this album as his little side project from Roxette, but it turned out to be a huge success, subsequently being certified 5× platinum status in Sweden. He also played some of the songs from it on the Gyllene Tider&#x27;s &quot;Finn 5 fel!&quot; tour in 2004, despite the fact that they were not Gyllene Tider songs.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Mazarin&quot; was well received by Swedish publications, with &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; and &quot;Expressen&quot; both highly praising the album.

<doc id="1246955" wikidata="Q6747966" url="?curid=1246955" title="Mandelbrot Competition">
<text>Named in honor of Benoit Mandelbrot, the Mandelbrot Competition was a mathematics competition founded by Sam Vandervelde, Richard Rusczyk and Sandor Lehoczky that operated from 1990 to 2019. It allowed high school students to compete individually and in four-person teams.
==Competition==
The Mandelbrot was a &quot;correspondence competition,&quot; meaning that the competition was sent to a school&#x27;s coach and students competed at their own school on a predetermined date. Individual results and team answers were then sent back to the contest coordinators. The most notable aspects of the Mandelbrot competition were the difficulty of the problems (much like the American Mathematics Competition and harder American Invitational Mathematics Examination problems) and the proof-based team round. Many past medalists at the International Mathematics Olympiad first tried their skills on the Mandelbrot Competition.

==History==
The Mandelbrot Competition was started by Sam Vandervelde, Richard Rusczyk, and Sandor Lehoczky while they were undergraduates in the early 1990s. Vandervelde ran the competition until its completion in 2019. Rusczyk now manages Art of Problem Solving Inc. and Lehoczky enjoys a successful career on Wall Street.

== Contest format ==

The individual competition consisted of seven questions of varying value, worth a total of 14 points, that students had 40 minutes to answer. The team competition was a proof-based competition, where many questions were asked about a particular situation, and a team of four students was given 60 minutes to answer.

== Divisions ==

The Mandelbrot Competition had two divisions, referred to as &quot;National&quot; and &quot;Regional.&quot; Questions at the National level were more difficult than those at the Regional level, but generally had overlap or concerned similar topics. For example, in the individual competition, the National competition would remove some of the easier Regional questions, and add some harder questions. In the team competition, the topic would be the same but the National level would be given fewer hints.

== Results ==
Results would be published after each annual iteration of the contest, and in its final iteration, the results were published online with School leaderboards and Individual leaderboards divided by region and national. However, since mandelbrot.org is not maintained any more, it can only be visited here.

<doc id="1246956" wikidata="Q957026" url="?curid=1246956" title="Love Happy">
<text>Love Happy is a 1949 American musical comedy film released by United Artists, directed by David Miller and starring the Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo and Chico) in their 13th and final feature film. The screenplay was written by Frank Tashlin and Mac Benoff, based on a story by Harpo.

The film, produced by former silent film star Mary Pickford, features Groucho Marx in a smaller role than usual, with a supporting cast including Ilona Massey, Vera-Ellen, Marion Hutton, Raymond Burr, Paul Valentine, Eric Blore, and Bruce Gordon (in his film debut), as well as a cameo appearance by a relatively unknown Marilyn Monroe.

==Plot==
Private detective Sam Grunion has been searching for the extremely valuable Royal Romanoff diamonds for eleven years, and his investigation leads him to a troupe of struggling performers, led by Mike Johnson, who are trying to put on a musical revue called &quot;Love Happy&quot;.

Grunion notes that the impoverished young dancers would starve were it not for the sweet, silent Harpo, at Herbert &amp; Herbert, a gourmet food shop that also trafficks in stolen diamonds. Harpo kindly helps ladies with their shopping bags, all the while pilfering their groceries and stuffing them in the pockets of his long trench coat. When the elegant Madame Egelichi arrives, store manager Lefty Throckmorton tells her that &quot;the sardines&quot; have come in. Harpo sneaks into the basement and watches as Lefty lovingly unpacks a sardine can marked with a Maltese cross, and swipes the can from Lefty&#x27;s pocket, replacing it with an unmarked one. Madame Egelichi, who has gone through eight husbands in three months in her quest for the Romanoff diamonds, is furious when Lefty produces the wrong can. When Lefty remembers seeing Harpo in the basement, she orders him to call the police and offer a $1,000 reward for his capture.

At the theater, meanwhile, unemployed entertainer Faustino the Great asks Mike for a job as a mind-reader, and when Faustino&#x27;s clever improvisation stops the show&#x27;s backer, Mr. Lyons, from repossessing the scenery, Mike gratefully hires him. Harpo, who is secretly in love with dancer Maggie Phillips, Mike&#x27;s girl friend, gives her the sardine can, and she says she will eat them tomorrow. A policeman sees Harpo inside the theater and brings him to Madame Egelichi, who turns Harpo over to her henchmen, Alphonse and Hannibal Zoto. After three days of interrogation, Harpo still refuses to talk, and when he is left alone, he calls Faustino at the theater, using the bike horn he carries in his pocket to communicate. Madame Egelichi listens on the extension as Faustino declares that there are plenty of sardines at the theater, and she goes there at once.

Meanwhile, Mike has just finished telling the troupe that they do not have enough money to open when Madame Egelichi arrives and offers to finance the show. Mike cancels his plans to take Maggie out for her birthday so that he and his new backer can discuss the arrangements. In the alley outside the theater, Harpo, having escaped from Madame Egelichi&#x27;s suite, finds the diamonds in the sardine can which had been set out for a cat, and puts them in his pocket. When he finds Maggie crying in her dressing room, Harpo takes her to Central Park, where he plays the harp for her and gives her the diamonds as a birthday gift.

On the opening night of the show, Grunion is visited by an agent of the Romanoff family, who threatens to kill him if he does not produce the diamonds in an hour. At the theater, Lefty and the Zoto brothers spy through a window as Maggie puts on the diamond necklace, but Mike asks her not to wear it, promising to buy her an engagement ring instead. As they kiss, Maggie removes the necklace and drops it on the piano strings. The curtain goes up, and when Harpo sees Lefty and the Zoto brothers menacing Maggie, he distracts them with a piece of costume jewelry and leads them up to the roof. Meanwhile, on stage, Faustino plays the piano, and when he strikes the keys forcefully, the diamond necklace flies into the air, drawing the attention of Madame Egelichi, who is watching from the audience. Faustino pockets the diamonds, then rushes to the roof to help Harpo. Madame Egelichi shows up with a gun and demands the necklace, but Faustino gives her the fake diamonds. After tying up Lefty and the Zotos and recovering the real diamonds, Harpo encounters Grunion, who has been hiding on the roof. Harpo drops the diamonds in Grunion&#x27;s pocket, but then steals them back as Madame Egelichi begins to lead the detective away.

Later, in his office, Grunion comments that Harpo disappeared with the diamonds, never realizing their true value. Grunion interrupts his story to take a phone call from his wife, who turns out to be the former Madame Egelichi.

==Cast==
==Musical numbers==
The film has a musical score and lyrics by Ann Ronell, with a lively film noirish dance version of a &quot;Sadie Thompson&quot; number. The piece feature&#x27;s Vera-Ellen and former ballet dancer Paul Valentine as one of the United States Marines on a South Pacific Island.

Chico plays a duet on &quot;Gypsy Love Song&quot; with actor-musician Leon Belasco as Mr. Lyons, the owner of the stage props and costumes. Belasco, on violin, starts playing many fancy trills until Chico says, &quot;Look, Mista Lyons, I know you wanna make a good impression – but please, don&#x27;t play better than me!&quot; Chico played this same tune in the Marx Bros. first film &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; 20 years earlier, in 1929.

===Songs===
==Production==
&quot;Love Happy&quot; was originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Harpo under the title &quot;Diamonds in the Sidewalk&quot;, Chico, who was usually in need of money due to his lifelong gambling addiction, also became involved in the project. Once Chico was in, financing for the film couldn&#x27;t be obtained unless all three Marx Brothers were featured, so Groucho agreed to appear in the film. &quot;Love Happy&quot; was the final film to be produced by Mary Pickford.

Groucho appears in the film without his usual greasepaint moustache and eyebrows; by this point in his career, he had grown an actual mustache and no longer saw the greasepaint as necessary. He briefly shares the screen with Harpo (the three never appear together in the same scene) during the climax of the film and mainly provides an encompassing narration to explain things when the necessary sequences for a coherent narrative were unavailable. Groucho avoided mentioning the film at all in his autobiography, &quot;Groucho and Me&quot; published in 1959, apparently at that time considering &quot;A Night in Casablanca&quot; (1946) as their last film together. He did acknowledge the film in later interviews for &quot;The Marx Brothers Scrapbook&quot; (1974) and in his later book, &quot;The Groucho Phile: An Illustrated Life&quot; (1976). Because of the encapsulated nature of Groucho&#x27;s scenes, it had long been assumed that his presence in the film was an afterthought. However, recently discovered letters from Groucho show that he was asked to be part of the project from its earliest stages in 1946–47.

The production ran out of money near the end of shooting, so the producers solicited advertising from several companies in order to complete the film. This unique form of product placement (quite rare at that time) was featured in the rooftop chase around advertising billboards.

==Release==
Although shooting began in July 1948, the film was not released generally until March 3, 1950. The film&#x27;s stated copyright is 1949, which is when it was shown in San Francisco on October 12. Originally released at 91 minutes, available non-theatrical prints run 85 minutes and contain some alternate footage with some brief snippets excised from some scenes and some gags completely eliminated. In 2015, Olive Films made the original unedited 91 minute theatrical print available on DVD.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Love Happy&quot; is generally regarded by Marx fans and critics as the weakest of all the Marx Brothers movies in which they were the leads. (The 1956 film &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot; is also generally rated very low amongst Marx brothers afficianados, but the brothers only make short individual cameos in that film.)

In its October 8, 1949 front-page editorial, as well as its review of the movie in the same issue, the motion picture trade periodical &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot;, which always disapproved of any movie showing brand-name products, severely criticized this film for its rooftop chase among billboards promoting Baby Ruth, General Electric, Fisk Tires, Bulova watches, Kool cigarettes, Wheaties and Mobil gasoline.

At the end of his March 8, 1950, episode of his &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; radio show, Groucho half-heartedly promotes the film as &quot;Harpo, Chico, and I tell a few jokes and do some acting. It&#x27;s &quot;very&quot; educational.&quot; In later years, on &quot;Today&quot;, Groucho dismissed it as a &quot;terrible picture&quot;, while speaking of the lasting impression Marilyn Monroe made during her screen test.

<text>The southern screamer (Chauna torquata) is a species of bird in family Anhimidae of the waterfowl order Anseriformes. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The southern screamer shares genus &quot;Chauna&quot; with the northern screamer (&quot;C. chavaria&quot;). One other species, the horned screamer (&quot;Anhima cornuta&quot;) is also in family Anhimidae. The southern screamer is monotypic.

==Description==

The southern screamer is one of the largest birds of southern South America at long and weighing about . Their flat wing measures , their tail , and their culmen . They are stout bodied with a disproportionately small head and a &quot;chicken-like&quot; grayish brown bill. The sexes have the same plumage. Their head and upperparts are gray with a velvety black &quot;collar&quot; around the base of the neck. Their wings and tail are dusky and the wing has two sharp spurs at its manus. The front of their neck, their breast, and their sides are pale gray faintly mottled and streaked with white. Their belly is unmarked pale gray or white. Their legs and feet are rosy.

==Distribution and habitat==

The southern screamer is found from the eastern half of Bolivia south into Argentina as far as Buenos Aires Province and east through Paraguay into southwestern Brazil and Uruguay. It has also been documented as a vagrant in southeastern Peru. It inhabits tropical and subtropical wetlands, including lakes, marshes, and flooded meadows with scattered trees.

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The southern screamer is generally considered to be non-migratory. However, seasonal changes in the numbers present in coastal and inland parts of Brazil&#x27;s Rio Grande do Sul suggest local movements between them.

===Locomotion===

The southern screamer is a good swimmer but prefers to move on the ground. It is an excellent flier and soarer. 

===Feeding===

The southern screamer feeds on the leaves, stems, and seeds of aquatic plants and also on some crops. They usually graze like geese but have been seen digging for food. Flocks of up to about 100 forage together in the non-breeding season.

===Breeding===

The southern screamer forms long-term pair bonds that in some cases last for life. Males and females court with mutual preening and duet calling. They build a large nest of sticks and reeds near shallow water and often nest in about the same location for several years. The typical clutch size is three to five eggs but can be up to seven; eggs are laid in October and November. Both parents incubate the eggs and care for the young. The incubation period is 43 to 46 days; fledging occurs eight to ten weeks after hatch and the young are independent after about 12 weeks.
===Vocalization===

The southern screamer&#x27;s &quot;loud, unmelodious, double-noted trumpet call&quot; has been further described as &quot;a low, throaty, almost barking, brief &quot;oh-WOOOW&quot; which also sounds sometimes as &quot;be-SERK&quot;.&quot; Female&#x27;s calls are somewhat weaker and higher pitched than males&#x27;. Screamers call both in flight and when perched, and the call can be heard for up to . away.

==Domestication==

Southern screamers are sometimes domesticated and are very good guard animals because of their loud, far-carrying, call.

==Status==

The IUCN has assessed the southern screamer as being of Least Concern. It has a very large range, and though its population size is unknown it is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. Draining of wetlands and persecution by farmers are potential threats, but &quot;the species seems able to compensate fairly well&quot;.

<text>&quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; is a short story by American writer Edward Everett Hale, first published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in December 1863. It is the story of a young American officer who declares himself disgusted with his country during a trial for treason, and wishes he never hears about her ever again. He is sentenced to spend the rest of his days at sea without so much as a word of news about the United States.

==Plot summary==
The protagonist is a young US Army lieutenant, Philip Nolan, who develops a friendship with the visiting Aaron Burr. When Burr is tried for treason, Nolan is tried as an accomplice. During his testimony, he bitterly renounces his nation and, &quot;in an intemperate outburst&quot; shouts Damn the United States! I wish I may never hear of the United States again!The judge is shocked by that statement and, convicting Nolan, grants him literally his wish. Nolan is to spend the rest of his life aboard US Navy warships in exile, with no right ever to set foot on US soil again and with explicit orders that no one shall ever again mention his country to him or bring him news about her.

The sentence is carried out to the letter. For the rest of his life, Nolan travels on ship, is transported from ship to ship, lives as a prisoner on the high seas, and is never allowed out in a home port. Though he is treated according to his former rank, nothing of his country is ever mentioned to him. None of the sailors in whose custody Nolan remains is allowed to speak to him about the US, and his newspapers are censored. Nolan is unrepentant at first, but over the years, he becomes sadder and wiser and desperate for news. One day, as he is being transferred to another ship, he beseeches a young sailor never to make the same mistake that he had: &quot;Remember, boy, that behind all these men... behind officers and government, and people even, there is the Country Herself, your Country, and that you belong to her as you belong to your own mother. Stand by her, boy, as you would stand by your mother...!&quot; On one such ship, he attends a party in which he dances with a young lady he had once known. He then beseeches her to tell him something, anything, about the US, but she withdraws and no longer speaks to him.

Deprived of news of his homeland, Nolan misses it more than his friends or family, more than art or music or love or nature. Dying aboard the , he shows his room to an officer, Danforth. It is &quot;a little shrine&quot; where the Stars and Stripes are draped around a picture of George Washington. Over his bed, Nolan has painted a bald eagle, with lightning &quot;blazing from his beak&quot; and claws grasping the globe. At the foot of his bed is an outdated map of the United States, showing many of its old territories that had, in the meantime, unbeknownst to him, been admitted to statehood. Nolan smiles, &quot;&quot;Here&quot;, you see, I have a country!&quot;

The dying man asks to be told the news of American history since 1807, and Danforth finally relates to him almost every major event that has happened to the US since his sentence was imposed; the narrator confesses, however, &quot;I could not make up my mouth to tell him a word about this infernal rebellion.&quot; Nolan asks officer Danforth to bring Nolan&#x27;s copy of the Presbyterian &quot;Book of Public Prayer&quot; and to read the words at the page at which it readily opens: Most heartily we beseech Thee with Thy favor to behold and bless Thy servant, the President of the United States, and all others in authority. Nolan says, &quot;I have repeated those prayers night and morning, it is now fifty-five years.&quot; Every day, he had read of the US but only in the form of a prayer to uphold its leaders, since the US Navy had neglected to keep that book from him.

Nolan asks Danforth that he be buried in the sea and have a gravestone placed in memory of him at Fort Adams, Mississippi, or at New Orleans. When he dies later that day, he is found to have drafted the epitaph for himself: &quot;In memory of PHILIP NOLAN, Lieutenant in the Army of the United States. He loved his country as no other man has loved her; but no man deserved less at her hands.&quot;

==Influence==

Clifton Fadiman wrote in his 1949 introduction to the book &quot;Masterpieces of World Literature&quot;, that no story better than The Man Without a Country expresses the spirit of American nationalism.

Hale published &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1863 to bolster support for the Union in the North. In this first publication, Hale&#x27;s name does not appear at the beginning or end of the story, though it appears in the annual index at the end of that issue of the magazine. It was later collected in 1868 in the book &quot;The Man Without a Country, and Other Tales&quot;, published by Ticknor and Fields.

Danforth&#x27;s summary to Nolan of American history from 1807 to 1860 is an outline of the Northern case for preservation of the Union. The young country is shown standing up fearlessly to the global superpower, Great Britain; expanding to North America&#x27;s Pacific coast; developing new contributions to human knowledge such as the Smithsonian Institution; and developing new technology such as steamboats.

Hale convinced many readers that Nolan was an actual figure, thus increasing the story&#x27;s effectiveness as a piece of patriotic literature. Years later he stated that the story, at least in part, was &quot;testimony&quot; against the election of 1863, in which Clement Vallandigham (1820–71), an ardent antiwar, pro-Confederate, anti–&quot;King Lincoln&quot; Ohio Democrat, was running for office from exile in Canada, and who, at his own earlier treason trial, like the fictional Nolan, expressed his disgust with the United States.

By frequently mentioning specific dates and places and by using numerous contemporary references, Hale grounded his story in a firm foundation of history and made the story seem like a record of actual events. In his 1893 and 1900 reminiscences, E. E. Hale stated, &quot;To write the story of &#x27;The Man Without a Country&#x27; and its sequel, &#x27;Philip Nolan’s Friends&#x27;, I had to make as careful a study as I could have the history of the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States.&quot;

The story&#x27;s conclusion hinges upon the titular character&#x27;s possession of the Presbyterian &quot;Book of Public Prayer,&quot; which had not been published until 1857. This indicates that Nolan having read from the book on a daily basis since the beginning of his sentence in 1807 was implausible.

The name &quot;Philip Nolan&quot; belonged to the business secretary and bookkeeper for James Wilkinson, a Spanish spy who was first an associate of Aaron Burr and then an informer on Burr. The spy&#x27;s bookkeeper Nolan was killed by the Spanish Army while he was stealing Texas mustangs in 1801, years before Burr&#x27;s trial.

==Monument==
A monument &quot;in memory of&quot; Nolan and bearing his self-written epitaph was placed in front of the Covington County Courthouse in Andalusia, Alabama, on July 4, 1975, by the Altrusa Club of Andalusia. The monument was placed as part of the Andalusia Bicentennial Committee&#x27;s official activities commemorating the United States Bicentennial.

==Adaptations==
Elizabeth McFadden and Agnes Louise Crimmins wrote the &quot;historical drama&quot; theatrical play &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; in 1918, published by Samuel French in New York City.

has been adapted in film several times, starting in 1917 with &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; starring Florence La Badie, a 1918 film titled &quot;My Own United States&quot;, one in 1925, and another &quot;Man Without a Country&quot; starring John Litel and Gloria Holden and released by Warner Brothers in 1937. Also in 1937, an opera of the story, eponymously titled, was composed by Walter Damrosch and premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in 1937.

On September 30, 1943, the horror/thriller radio program &quot;The Weird Circle&quot; presented an adaptation of the story. Bill Johnstone, best known as Orson Welles&#x27; replacement as the title character in &quot;The Shadow&quot; radio drama, narrated and took part in the story as Hale.

A four-part dramatization was recorded in June 1947 and issued by Decca on two coupled 12&quot; 78 rpm discs. Bing Crosby provided the narration and Frank Lovejoy portrayed Philip Nolan. Later that same year on November 26, a dramatization was performed on &quot;Philco Radio Time&quot;, with Crosby (the program&#x27;s star and host) again providing narration.

In 1949, the &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; series published the story in issue #63, illustrated by Henry C. Kiefer, an artist who &quot;defined the &quot;Classics&quot; style.&quot; The story was later re-published with a cover by Alex Blum.

&quot;The Railroad Hour&quot; presented a 30-minute adaptation of &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; on June 28, 1953. Gordon MacRae and Dorothy Warenskjold starred in the broadcast.

In Sam Fuller&#x27;s film &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot; (1957), Captain Clark (Brian Keith), a U.S. Army engineer commissioned to build a fort on Sioux territory, relates the Nolan story to O&#x27;Meara (Rod Steiger), a Southerner who, refusing to accept the defeat of the Confederacy, has married among the Sioux and been appointed by them to see the fort is built where agreed. In the context of pressing O&#x27;Meara to decide whether his loyalties lie ultimately with the Sioux or with the Americans, Clark narrates the Nolan story as historical fact.

In 1973, a made-for-television movie was written by Sidney Carroll and directed by Delbert Mann. It featured Cliff Robertson as Philip Nolan, Beau Bridges as Frederick Ingham, Peter Strauss as Arthur Danforth, Robert Ryan as Lt. Cmdr. Vaughan, Walter Abel as Col. A. B. Morgan, Geoffrey Holder as one of the slaves on a slave ship, Shepperd Strudwick as the Secretary of the Navy, John Cullum as Aaron Burr, and Patricia Elliott as Mrs. Graff.

In May 1977, a three-act radio play was broadcast as an episode of Himan Brown&#x27;s &quot;The General Mills Radio Adventure Theater&quot;. Russell Horton performed the part of Nolan while Tom Bosley hosted the series.

In 2016, Chuck Pfarrer penned a historical novel entitled &quot;Philip Nolan: The Man Without a Country&quot; for the U.S. Naval Institute Press.

<doc id="1246968" wikidata="Q997306" url="?curid=1246968" title="Northern screamer">
<text>The northern screamer (Chauna chavaria) is a Near Threatened species of bird in family Anhimidae of the waterfowl order Anseriformes. It is found in Colombia and Venezuela.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The northern screamer shares genus &quot;Chauna&quot; with the southern screamer (&quot;C. torquata&quot;). One other species, the horned screamer (&quot;Anhima cornuta&quot;) is also in family Anhimidae. The northern screamer is monotypic.

==Description==

The northern screamer is long. They are stout bodied with a disproportionately small head and a gray bill. The sexes have the same plumage. Adults have a gray crown with a long crest, a mostly white face, a wide black band around the neck, and a dark gray body, wings, and tail. Their wing has two sharp spurs at its manus. They have bare red skin around their brown eye and reddish orange legs and feet. Juveniles are similar to adults but drabber.

==Distribution and habitat==

The northern screamer is found across northern Colombia from the Atrato River and Magdalena River valleys east into the Lake Maracaibo area of Venezuela. It inhabits a variety of wet landscapes including swamps, marshes, lagoons, riverbanks, and seasonally flooded river plains.

==Behavior==
===Movement===

The northern screamer is essentially sedentary but local wandering by non-breeders and juveniles is suspected.

===Feeding===

The northern screamer feeds on the leaves, stems, and roots of aquatic plants. They usually graze like geese, sometimes in loose flocks.

===Breeding===

The northern screamer is territorial during the breeding season. The pair build a mound of plant material and debris as a nest. Breeding can be at any time of year but most eggs are laid in October and November. The typical clutch size is three to five eggs but can be up to seven. Both parents incubate the eggs and care for the young. The incubation period is 42 to 44 days; fledging occurs eight to ten weeks after hatch and the young are independent after about 12 weeks.
===Vocalization===

The northern screamer, like others of its family, is very vocal. Its primary vocalization is a &quot;single, rather high-pitched yelping call...&#x27;kleer-a-ruk, cherio&#x27;.&quot;

==Status==

The IUCN originally assessed the northern screamer as Threatened. Since 2004 has treated it as Near Threatened but it nearly again meets the criteria for Threatened status. It has a somewhat limited range and its estimated population of between 1500 and 7000 mature individuals is believed to be decreasing. It occurs in several protected areas in Colombia but even they have suffered from habitat destruction. The species is also affected by egg collecting and hunting for food, domestic and industrial pollution of its habitat, and urbanization.

<doc id="1246976" wikidata="Q2824671" url="?curid=1246976" title="Adna R. Chaffee Jr.">
<text>Adna Romanza Chaffee Jr. (September 23, 1884 – August 22, 1941) was an officer in the United States Army, called the &quot;Father of the Armored Force&quot; for his role in developing the U.S. Army&#x27;s tank forces.

==Early life and education==
Chaffee was born in Junction City, Kansas, on September 23, 1884, to his father, Lieutenant General Adna R. Chaffee, and mother, Annie Francis Rockwell. He was commissioned as a lieutenant of Cavalry in 1906 following his graduation from the United States Military Academy. He was 31st out of 78 pupils in his class. Chaffee learned to ride on horseback from a young age, and would later receive recognition as &quot;the Army&#x27;s finest horseman&quot;.

Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1914, he became an Hereditary First Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Career==
From 1914 to 1915, Chaffee was posted with the 7th Cavalry in the Philippines, and from 1916 to 1917, Chaffee was assigned to West Point as the senior cavalry instructor in the Tactical Department. When America entered World War I in April 1917, Chaffee was temporarily promoted to major and assigned as the adjutant for the 81st Division as it organized at Camp Jackson, South Carolina. During the war, Chaffee served as an Assistant G3 Operations officer in the US IV Corps, and later returned to the 81st Division as the G3 during the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives. Promoted to the temporary rank of colonel, he became the G3, III Corps at the end of the war, and remained with the corps for occupation duty in 1919.

Following the war, he returned to his Regular Army rank of captain of cavalry and became an instructor at the General Staff School and the Army School of the Line at Fort Leavenworth. During the 1920s, he helped develop the armor concepts and doctrine of the future. He predicted in 1927 that mechanized armies would dominate the next war and helped the first effort to develop a U.S. Army armored force. In 1931, newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel Chaffee was assigned as the executive officer of the embryonic 1st Cavalry Division, where he continued to develop and experiment with armored forces and became the leading American advocate of mechanized warfare. From 1934 to 1938, Chaffee was posted to the War Department as the Chief of the Budget and Legislative Planning Branch. Chaffee then returned to the 1st Cavalry Division at Fort Knox, where he was advanced to brigadier general and given command of the 7th Mechanized Brigade. Chaffee led the unit through the Plattsburg and Louisiana Maneuvers of 1939–1940, where he helped develop Army doctrine for armored and mechanized formations.

In June 1940, Chaffee was appointed the commander of the Armored Force, and given responsibility for integrating all branches of the Army into mechanized warfare. He played a major role in the development and fielding of new armored and mechanized infantry divisions for World War II. Chaffee was promoted to major general in October 1940, and given command of the I Armored Corps. 

When Chaffee became ill with cancer he was succeeded as corps commander by Charles L. Scott. Chaffee died in Boston on August 22, 1941. He was buried next to his father in Section 3 of Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
The M24 Chaffee light tank is named after him.

Fort Chaffee, near Fort Smith, Arkansas, is named in his honor.

<text>CSS &quot;Raleigh&quot; was a steam-powered Civil War casemate ironclad. She was fitted with a spar torpedo instead of an iron ram and was built in 1863–1864 by the Confederate States Navy at Wilmington, North Carolina. While she was being built her commander was Lieutenant John Wilkinson (CSN). She was put into commission on April 30, 1864 under the command of Lieutenant J. Pembroke Jones, CSN.

Built to chief CSN constructor John L. Porter&#x27;s similar plans for those of the ironclad , she had been laid down and launched at the foot of Church Street; her fitting-out was completed by the shipyard J. L. Cassidey &amp; Sons.

CSS &quot;Raleigh&quot; was one of two s built for the Confederate Navy at Wilmington during the Civil War. A total of six &quot;Richmond&quot;-class ironclads were laid down at Richmond, Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah in the spring of 1862. Chief naval constructor John L. Porter had designed these armored steam ships for harbor defense, adapting plans he had originally conceived in 1846, fifteen years before to the war. On April 20, 1864 the newly completed &quot;Raleigh&quot; steamed down the Cape Fear River and joined her sister ironclad CSS &quot;North Carolina&quot;, which was already in CSN service at Smithville.

&quot;Raleigh&quot; drew of water, less than the &quot;North Carolina&quot;. Flag Officer William F. Lynch quickly decided to take his new ironclad over the bar at New Inlet, North Carolina and attack the Union blockading squadron at sea.

On May 6 &quot;Raleigh&quot; emerged from the Cape Fear River and stood out to the Atlantic, accompanied by CSS &quot;Yadkin&quot; and CSS &quot;Equator&quot;, where she engaged six Federal blockaders, including and , off New Inlet.

The plan was ill-conceived, as the &quot;Richmond&quot;-class ironclads, being designed for harbor defense and calm water, were not seaworthy. Nonetheless, the officers and men of &quot;Raleigh&quot; prepared their ship for battle. The engagement that followed was shrouded in darkness and marked by confusion. &quot;Raleigh&quot;, because of her slow speed on open sea, was unable to close with the Federals. Flares and cannon fire alerted the rest of the blockading squadron, but most commanders, unaware of the ironclad&#x27;s presence, assumed a blockade runner had been cornered. For the rest of the night, &quot;Raleigh&quot; steamed blindly through the blockading squadron, unnoticed. At daybreak, the ironclad returned to New Inlet and crossed the bar at 7:15 a.m. The &quot;battle,&quot; as such, was over, neither side sustaining serious damage or gaining advantage.

After entering Cape Fear, &quot;Raleigh&quot; turned south, but soon ran hard aground on a bar known as &quot;the Rip&quot;. As the tide went out, the now unsupported weight of the ironclad&#x27;s armored casemate, cannon, and machinery bore down heavily on the aft section of her keel. Unable to sustain the added weight pressure, &quot;Raleigh&quot; &quot;broke her back&quot;, resulting in a total loss of the new ironclad after serving just one week in the Confederate Navy. Salvage crews reclaimed her iron plating, both her Brooke rifles, both smoothbore cannon, and shipped her boilers to , then being repaired at Columbus, Georgia.

In 1994 the wreck was investigated by the North Carolina State Underwater Archaeology Unit with help from students of East Carolina University.

<text>Crush 40 is a Japanese-American hard rock band. The group consists of guitarist and composer Jun Senoue and principal vocalist Johnny Gioeli. Crush 40 is best known for their contributions to the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; video game series.

Senoue has been employed by Sega as a composer since 1993. While preparing music for &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;, he contacted Gioeli to perform the game&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;. They also recorded the soundtrack for &quot;NASCAR Arcade&quot; under the name &quot;Sons of Angels&quot;, which was released in Japan as the album &quot;Thrill of the Feel&quot; (2000). Afterward, Senoue and Gioeli continued recording music for further &quot;Sonic&quot; titles, as well as their own original songs.

Crush 40 has released a total of two studio albums, two live albums, two compilations, an EP, and individual tracks, mostly under Sega&#x27;s Wave Master label. The band&#x27;s musical style of hard rock, considered by some to be a continuation of glam rock, has created a legacy with fans of the &quot;Sonic&quot; video game series.

==History==

===Formation, &quot;Thrill of the Feel&quot;, and &quot;Crush 40&quot;===
After graduating from college, Jun Senoue was hired by Sega in 1993 to compose music for video games. His first project in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series was &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3 &amp; Knuckles&quot; (1994)&quot;,&quot; and he also contributed to &quot;Dark Wizard&quot;, &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;, and &quot;Sega Rally 2.&quot; During recording for &quot;Daytona USA: Championship Circuit Edition&quot;, Senoue worked with Eric Martin of Mr. Big to record the main theme, &quot;Sons of Angels&quot;. Senoue said he brought a rock music feel to the games he worked on, including the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series, because he is a &quot;rock guy&quot;.

In 1998, Senoue contacted vocalist Johnny Gioeli during the recording process for &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; and recorded their first song, &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;. Senoue had previously recorded a demo of the song with Eizo Sakamoto on vocals, but Senoue has stated that he wrote the song assuming Gioeli would sing it. According to Gioeli, Senoue was a fan of Gioeli&#x27;s band Hardline and connected with him via Doug Aldrich, the guitarist for Whitesnake. After making the track, the two stayed in contact, having enjoyed working together and wanting to do more. Senoue and Gioeli worked together again on songs for &quot;NASCAR Arcade.&quot; In addition to Senoue and Gioeli, Naoto Shibata and Hirotsugu Homma of Loudness played the bass and drums, respectively, for the songs, and the group took the name Sons of Angels, from the title of the song Senoue recorded with Eric Martin. In 2000, the band released &quot;Thrill of the Feel&quot; in Japan, published by Victor Entertainment. The album contained the tracks they had written for &quot;NASCAR Arcade&quot;, along with &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;.

During the development of &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, Senoue and Gioeli reunited to record the title track, &quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot;. As Shibata and Homma were busy performing with Loudness and later Anthem, was brought in to play bass, and Katsuji Kirita from Gargoyle and The Cro-Magnons played drums. According to &quot;Vice&quot;, &quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot; is one of Gioeli&#x27;s favorite songs. Senoue recorded the intro to the song for the game&#x27;s trial edition; he worked on the rest of the arrangement later and completed it within one day. He then sent a demo to Gioeli to record his vocals. Gioeli was given the task of writing the lyrics for &quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot;. He initially was nervous and asked Senoue if his lyrics were okay on multiple occasions, but despite this, &quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot; became one of the most memorable songs on the &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; soundtrack according to Sean Aitchison of &quot;Fanbyte&quot;, and even appearing in the third Sonic The Hedgehog movie.

Around this time, the band was renamed Crush 40, after discovering that there was a Norwegian rock band already named Sons of Angels. When asked why he chose &quot;Crush 40&quot;, Senoue said, &quot;When we had to pick one, we chose the word we like... &#x27;Crush&#x27; is one of them, and Johnny added the number. Crush is the name of the soda too... that&#x27;s my favorite!&quot; Gioeli added that his inspiration for the title was a desire to &quot;crush&quot; his forties, which he was approaching at the time. Two years after the 2001 release of &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;, the album &quot;Crush 40&quot; was released by Frontiers Records. The album contained the vocal tracks from &quot;NASCAR Arcade&quot;, &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; and &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;. According to Senoue, Crush 40 is specifically the band of himself and Gioeli, though tracks &quot;It Doesn&#x27;t Matter&quot; and &quot;Escape from the City&quot; (sung by Tony Harnell and Ted Poley, respectively) were included on the album. Senoue explained this was done to exhibit these songs to fans.

===Recordings for Sega and &quot;The Best of Crush 40: Super Sonic Songs&quot;===
In 2003, Crush 40 composed two new songs entitled &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot; and &quot;What I&#x27;m Made Of...&quot; for Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;, the first multiplatform &quot;Sonic&quot; game. Both Senoue and Gioeli have called &quot;What I&#x27;m Made Of...&quot; their favorite song to perform. For &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; in 2005, Crush 40 recorded &quot;I Am... All of Me&quot;, as well as &quot;Never Turn Back&quot;. The drums for both songs were recorded by Toru Kawamura. Additionally, Crush 40 recorded covers of songs used in 2006&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, &quot;Sonic and the Secret Rings&quot;, &quot;Sonic Riders&quot; and &quot;Zero Gravity&quot;, and &quot;Sonic CD&quot;. The band also recorded five original songs and a cover for &quot;Sonic and the Black Knight.&quot;

For their first 10 years, Crush 40 never performed live. In 2008, Crush 40 performed live at the Tokyo Game Show, with Senoue and Gioeli performing with backing tracks. A year later, Senoue revealed to &quot;Famitsu&quot; that Crush 40 had two album releases in the works, one of which was a &quot;Best Of&quot; album, due for release in September 2009. He also announced the release of future songs that were not written for video games. &quot;The Best of Crush 40 – Super Sonic Songs&quot; was released on November 18, 2009. In addition to compiling various Crush 40 songs from previous games, the album featured a new song, &quot;Is It You,&quot; and a cover of &quot;Fire Woman&quot;, a song released by The Cult in 1989. Senoue was also credited as a soloist on &quot;Before This&quot;, a song from the 2009 Hardline album &quot;Leaving the End Open&quot;.

===&quot;Rise Again&quot;, &quot;Live!&quot;, &quot;2 Nights 2 Remember&quot;, and &quot;Driving Through Forever&quot;===

After the 2010 release of &quot;Sonic Free Riders&quot;, Crush 40&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; decreased. Senoue was no longer lead composer on games in the &quot;Sonic&quot; series after 2011&#x27;s &quot;Sonic Generations&quot;. During the next few years, Crush 40 made more live performances and recordings. In 2010, Crush 40 performed live at the Summer of Sonic convention. The next year, Crush 40 recorded a single, &quot;Song of Hope&quot;, as inspiration for hope for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. According to Senoue, the song was written for charity, specifically for the Red Cross. Subsequently, &quot;Song of Hope&quot; and three new songs were released as an EP called &quot;Rise Again&quot;. One of the included songs, &quot;Sonic Youth&quot;, pays tribute to Crush 40&#x27;s fans with numerous references to the band&#x27;s past songs.

On March 29 and 30, 2012, Crush 40 performed live at Shibuya GUILTY in Tokyo, with Sonic Team producer Takashi Iizuka in the audience. From this concert, performed with Taneda and Kawamura, Crush 40&#x27;s album &quot;Live!&quot; was recorded, and was released on October 3, 2012. The band also performed at the St. Louis Sonic Boom Festival in August 2013, Detroit’s Youmacon anime convention at the Renaissance Center in 2015, and performed additional shows at the Summer of Sonic convention in 2012 and 2016, and San Diego Comic-Con conventions in 2016 and 2017. After more live performances at the Tokyo Game Show and Japan Game Music Festival 2013, in 2014 Crush 40 was announced for another two-night performance at Shibuya GUILTY. For the concert, Senoue and Gioeli were joined by Taneda and Katsuji. The concert featured two new songs, as well as a performance of Hardline&#x27;s &quot;Love Leads the Way&quot;. Recorded from that performance, &quot;2 Nights 2 Remember&quot;, Crush 40&#x27;s second live album, was released on May 13, 2015. It features four additional studio-recorded songs.

In 2018, Senoue was named lead composer for the soundtrack for &quot;Team Sonic Racing&quot;. He was requested to make the game&#x27;s theme a song by Crush 40. This led to Senoue and Gioeli recording &quot;Green Light Ride&quot; for the game, Crush 40&#x27;s first &quot;Sonic&quot; game theme in several years. The song was premiered at E3 2018, to a stronger reaction than Senoue expected. A short version of the song was made available in December 2018, before the 2019 release of the game itself. Senoue expressed his joy at being able to record another game theme with Crush 40, twenty years after Crush 40 began. Subsequently, Crush 40 released another compilation album, &quot;Driving Through Forever&quot;, in 2019. In 2020, Gioeli re-recorded &quot;Song of Hope&quot; with Bulgarian vocalist Sevi, as a way of reconnecting with fans during the coronavirus pandemic. On June 23, 2021, Sega held the Sonic the Hedgehog 30th Anniversary Symphony with Crush 40 as one of the participating acts.

In February 2024, following the use of its instrumental in a teaser, Gioeli confirmed that &quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot; would be featured in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot;. He said that how the song is used is ultimately up to producers. The song was ultimately used in the movie&#x27;s climax and its riffs were used as a leitmotif for the character of Shadow.

In December 2024, Gioeli sued Sega of America, claiming ownership of the master recording and co-ownership of the composition of &quot;Live &amp; Learn.&quot; Gioeli demanded $1 million in damages and restitution for the song&#x27;s unauthorized use in more than two dozen subsequent releases, including ports of &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; and the Japanese version of the &quot;Sonic X&quot; anime.

==Musical style and legacy==
According to Allegra Frank and Philip Kollar of &quot;Polygon&quot;, Crush 40 and Senoue have made &quot;some of the most memorable butt rock tracks from Sonic history (and the history of video games in general)&quot;. Writing for &quot;Vice&quot;, Andy McDonald stated that Crush 40 helped to keep glam rock alive after grunge had supplanted it as a more popular style of rock music. Reviewing the album &quot;Crush 40&quot;, Chris Greening of &quot;Video Game Music Online&quot; highlights the hard rock sound and showing of Gioeli&#x27;s experience in the vocals, stating that &quot;Live &amp; Learn&quot; is &quot;an ecstatic Americana rock anthem featuring Johnny at his best&quot;, while also stating the instrumentals are inspired by early 1990s heavy metal. He calls the album &quot;among the best of the genre in game music&quot;.

Gioeli, who is not a gamer, described his songwriting process with Senoue for games as being akin to writing a soundtrack for a movie, watching scenes from the game or looking at storyboards. According to Gioeli, &quot;Jun and I have our system—he starts with a musical feeling and sometimes a melody idea and then I go nuts with it! The lyrics do have to be approved for content, but that&#x27;s it. We have the freedom to write what we feel is the right song for the scene.&quot; He has stated that among his three main projects—Crush 40, Hardline, and performing with Axel Rudi Pell—all three are different styles of rock music and he has to set himself in the &quot;right emotions&quot; to perform.

When interviewed about his style and that of the band, Jun Senoue said, &quot;I know what my style is, and I know what my favourite genres of music are. I listen to a lot of metal music, as well as other genres of music, and my inspiration is always there. The style of the music in the game does change, and it gives a great sense of progression... When we got together to write stuff for &quot;Shadow&quot; [&quot;the Hedgehog&quot;], we found that our fresh ideas were a lot different to the songs we&#x27;d written back in 2002 – our sound had changed.&quot; Senoue has stated that the tempo of each song written for a game is based on how it is planned to be used and what would be suitable, but those songs not for a game are what the duo want to perform.

Writing for &quot;Fanbyte&quot;, Sean Aitchison stated that Crush 40 provided a signature musical style for the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series and expanded the musical tastes of &quot;Sonic&quot; fans. According to Aitchison, &quot;The band embedded themselves in the memories and hearts of an entire generation of &quot;Sonic&quot; fans. Though their contributions to the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise may be small in number, they are massive in impact.&quot; Kofi-Charu Nat Turner&#x27;s 2008 study of media usage in an American urban middle school listed the band as a common interest within the group studied.

<doc id="1246997" wikidata="Q666960" url="?curid=1246997" title="Mainz Cathedral">
<text>Mainz Cathedral or St. Martin&#x27;s Cathedral ( or, officially, ) is located near the historical center and pedestrianized market square of the city of Mainz, Germany. This 1000-year-old Roman Catholic cathedral is the site of the episcopal see of the Bishop of Mainz.

Mainz Cathedral is predominantly Romanesque in style, but later exterior additions over many centuries have resulted in the appearance of various architectural influences seen today. It comprises three aisles and stands under the patronage of Saint Martin of Tours. The eastern quire is dedicated to Saint Stephen.

The interior of the cathedral houses tombs and funerary monuments of former powerful Electoral-prince-archbishops, or , of the diocese and contains religious works of art spanning a millennium. The cathedral also has a central courtyard and statues of Saint Boniface and The Madonna on its grounds.

During the time of Mainz Archbishop Willigis (975–1011), the city of Mainz flourished economically, and Willigis became one of the most influential politicians of that time, ascending to regent of the empire between 991 and 994. In 975–976 shortly after his installation he ordered the construction of a new cathedral in the pre-Romanesque Ottonian architecture style. This new building was part of his vision of Mainz as the &quot;second Rome&quot;.

This new cathedral was to take over the functions of two churches: the old cathedral and St. Alban&#x27;s, which was the largest church in the area, belonging to a Benedictine abbey and serving as the burial ground for the bishops and other nobles, including Fastrada, a spouse of Charlemagne. Most of the synods and other important meetings were held at St. Alban&#x27;s Abbey.

The new cathedral consisted of a double chancel with two transepts. The main hall was built in the typical triple-nave &quot;cross&quot; pattern. As was usual at that time no vault was included because of structural difficulties relating to the size of the building. Six towers rose from the church. A cloister was enclosed in the structure and a small freestanding church, St. Mary&#x27;s Church, connected by a colonnade. This small church developed later into the collegiate church of St. Maria ad Gradus.

Sandstone was used as the primary building material for the cathedral. The inside was plastered white under the Archbishop Bardo, probably in the middle of the 11th century. During renovations ordered by Henry IV in the late 11th century, much of the outside was also plastered, but the cornices were left exposed in their original red and yellow. It is believed that the coloring of the cathedral was changed on a number of occasions, but no further documentation of the coloring is available until records of the Baroque works.
The cathedral suffered extensive damage from a fire on the day of its inauguration in 1009. Archbishop Bardo (Bardo of Oppershofen) presided over the completion of the cathedral begun under Willigis. By 1037 the main portions of the body of Mainz Cathedral were complete. Willigis was buried in the second church he had initiated, St. Stephan&#x27;s, in 1011.

==The two chancels==

From the ninth to 12th century, several important churches in the Holy Roman Empire were built with choirs on both ends. One of the first was Cologne Cathedral of 855 (&quot;Hildebld&#x27;s Cathedral&quot;). One of the oldest preserved examples is St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Hildesheim, erected since 1010. Gernrode Abbey church was added a second choir, in the 12th century. This type of footplans also was acquired in Poland (Tum Collegiate Church) and Hungary (Pécs Cathedral). The reason for building two chancels is not entirely clear. Many scholars suggest that there is some symbolic significance, such as empire and church, or body and spirit, but no irrefutable evidence for these theories exists. Others claim that the construction has a functional purpose for ceremonial processions. Whatever the original intent of the double chancel, the eastern chancel came to serve as the location for the mass and the western chancel was reserved for the bishop and pontiffs.

===Bardo&#x27;s western chancel===

In most cathedrals at the time, the main chancel lay on the east side. Willigis, however, designed his cathedral with the main chancel on the west, presumably modeled after the great basilicas in Rome, which were constructed this way. (Willigis&#x27;s design bore a striking resemblance to Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.)

The chancel was badly damaged in the fire of 1009, and remained that way under Archbishops Erkanbald and Aribo. The chancel was finally reconstructed under Bardo. He then buried his predecessor Aribo there, before the rest of the cathedral was even finished. (Willigis&#x27;s remains are not, as sometimes believed, in Mainz Cathedral; he was buried in his second construction project, St. Stephen&#x27;s.)

===Henry IV&#x27;s eastern chancel===

In 1081, fire once again struck the cathedral, and the appearance of the Salian western end is not known. In 1100, Henry IV ordered reconstruction in the old Lombardic style. The old flat chancel end on the east side was replaced with a large apse, which external gallery with a narrow arcade supported by short columns crowned the semicircular wall with a wide pseudo arcade and tall pilasters on both sides. The new chancel had a triple-nave crypt. The damaged square tower had been replaced with an octagonal dome, above which an octagonal tower was added later. Flanking stair turrets remained from the first cathedral. These changes closely resembled the renovations Henry had overseen on Speyer Cathedral a few years earlier.

Henry also undertook a few other minor changes, such as raising the transept on the east side and adding openings at the column level. These column-level portals were among the first ever such constructed.

Henry died in 1106, before his intended changes were complete. With his death, the funding for the renovation of the cathedral dried up and so the remaining construction was abandoned. Mainz Cathedral is considered one of the three &quot;Kaiserdome&quot; (&quot;Emperor&#x27;s Cathedrals&quot;) of the Holy Roman (German) Empire, along with Worms Cathedral and Speyer Cathedral.

===Evolution of the main nave===

Archbishop Adalbert I of Saarbrücken (1110–1137) had a two-story chapel, called the Gotthard Chapel, built as the official palace chapel next to the cathedral. It is believed that he also ordered the renovation of the main body of the cathedral, mainly due to similarities between the main hall and the vault of the new chapel.

Conception for the renovations was again taken from the Romanesque Speyer Cathedral. This time, however, without money from the emperor, the builders lacked the resources to acquire the high-quality sandstone used in Henry&#x27;s additions. They instead used limestone. The other aspects of the renovations were also much cheaper, and the extravagant style of Speyer Cathedral was largely avoided.

The central nave was built to , short of Speyer Cathedral&#x27;s . It seems that the blind arches were intended to encompass the windows, as in Speyer Cathedral, but the height of the roof did not allow this. The resulting three-level effect, due to the arches ending before the windows, was a technique not before seen in architecture.

The main hall was further renovated throughout the entire 12th century. The entire outer wall structure was eventually replaced. Around the year 1200, the ceiling was replaced with a ribbed vault, a rather new technique for the time.

===Additional renovations===
Around the time that the ribbed vault was installed it was decided to renovate the western half of the cathedral, which had stayed relatively unchanged since Willigis&#x27; construction. In contrast to the eastern renovations done earlier, which were in a high-Romanesque style, these new changes were carried out in a late Romanesque style. A new vault was added to span the north and south arms of the transept. Large windows were added to the wall separating the transept from the main hall. The large dome connecting the transept to the main hall was decorated with friezes and pillars.

Three small apses and two very large pillars were added to support the small flank towers. Pediments were added to the three open sides of the chancel. In general, the western section of the cathedral was extensively decorated to keep up with the newly renovated eastern section.

==Post-Romanesque building and renovation==
Already at the time of renovations on the western segment of the cathedral, new architectural styles were being ushered in. This included Gothic additions and, later, Baroque pieces as well.

===Gothic additions===
The first post-Romanesque addition to the cathedral was the western rood screen. This was done in the Gothic style at the time of the western renovations. Following this example, the intersect area was heavily renovated in the next few centuries in the Gothic style.
Starting in 1279, Gothic chapels featuring large decorative windows were built onto the cathedral. In 1418 the Nassauer Chapel, a freestanding burial chapel in the middle nave was built at the request of Archbishop John II of Nassau. The construction of this chapel is attributed to Madern Gerthener, who was also responsible for the Memorial Chapel built into the entrance hall to the western wing of the intersect area.

The towers were also renovated during this period. Belfries were added to the two towers at the crossings, on the eastern tower in 1361 and on the western in 1418. These towers were topped with Gothic-style pyramid roofs. (These towers turned out to be so heavy that the eastern tower had to be supported by a pillar erected in 1430.)

The cloister was heavily renovated and the &quot;Liebfrauenkirche&quot; was completely replaced at this time, marking the last of the Gothic renovations to the building. The roof on the eastern tower, however, was replaced in 1579 by a flatter one due to weight concerns. After that, no major alterations were made to the cathedral for almost two centuries.

===Baroque additions===

In 1767 the western cross-tower was struck by lightning and its roof was destroyed. In 1769 the engineer Franz Ignaz Michael Neumann designed a new multi-story roof for the tower. All the towers in the western wing were roofed with this new Baroque stone design, although care was taken to preserve the previous styles as well. The pinnacles of the pediments on the chapels were replaced with urn-like structures. The famed weathervane, called the &quot;Domsgickel&quot;, was added at this time as well.

The inside of the cathedral was heavily whitewashed. A statue of St. Martin and the Beggar was erected on the roof of the western chancel in 1769.

===19th-century reconstruction===

The Archbishopric of Mainz suffered heavily in the late 18th century. Following the invasion by French revolutionary troops in 1792, Mainz came under attack from Prussian troops in 1793 in the siege that led to the end of the Republic of Mainz. This attack damaged large portions of the cathedral, particularly the east wing, the cloister, and the &quot;Liebfrauenkirche&quot;, which was demolished in 1803 (the year after Mainz lost its archbishopric and became a regular diocese). The cathedral was used as an army camp for several years, and therefore large amounts of the cathedral&#x27;s artefacts were sold, the wooden interior was burned for heat.

Bishop Joseph Ludwig Colmar (1802–1818), with support from Napoleon, set into motion restoration efforts. These efforts were interrupted by quartering needs for the French Army in 1813, and the cathedral was used as a church in 1814 for the first time in eleven years. By 1831, the reparations had been for the most part completed. The major change to the building was an iron cupola on the main eastern tower built by architect Georg Moller. But this cupola was removed in 1870 because it was too heavy.

After that, Pierre Cuypers undertook a lengthy restoration work. The support pillar in the eastern cross-tower was removed, as the heavy belfry no longer stood. The crypt in the eastern chancel was rebuilt, but not to the original specifications of the one built by Henry IV. At the conclusion of these reconstructions, a neo-Romanesque tower was erected in place of the eastern cross-tower in 1875.

At this time the cathedral was once again repainted. Large and colorful Nazarene movement murals, including some by Philipp Veit, were painted to decorate the inside of the cathedral.

===20th century restorations===

Conservation efforts began in the 1900s to save the cathedral from further damage. After a lowering of the groundwater, the wooden substructures became rotten and the foundations started to fail and needed to be replaced. Beginning in 1909 the old foundations were underpinned. Works stopped in 1916 due to World War I. Between 1924 and 1928 the fundaments were completely reinforced by a new fundament made of concrete. Concrete and steel were used to anchor the towers and main vault.
A new floor, made of red marble, was constructed in this period. Architect Paul Meyer-Speer engineered a system to modify the inner walls with colorful sandstone, removing most of the paintings by Veit and restoring a look similar to the original Willigis-Bardo construction. Unfortunately this system did not withstand continuing restoration efforts, and by 1959 most of the color was gone.

In World War II, Mainz was a target of Allied bombing multiple times. The cathedral was hit several times in August 1942. Most of the roofs burned, and the top level of the cloister was destroyed. The vault, however, withstood the attacks and remained intact. The damaged elements were restored as authentically as possible, a process which continued well into the 1970s. In addition, much of the glass in the cathedral was replaced.

The outside of the cathedral was colored red to match the historical buildings of Mainz. In addition, extensive cleaning and restoration efforts were undertaken, ending in 1975. In that year, the thousandth year since the beginning of the cathedral&#x27;s construction was celebrated.

In 2001, new efforts were begun to restore the cathedral both inside and outside. They were expected to take from ten to fifteen years.

In 2004, two large windows, by the renowned glass artist Johannes Schreiter, were installed.

==Emperors and the cathedral==
When Mainz was an archbishopric, the cathedral was the official seat of the archdiocese. In 1184 Emperor Barbarossa celebrated the accolade of his sons in the cathedral. The feast of 1184 on the Maaraue, the Diet of Pentecost, became legendary in history as the greatest feast of the Middle Ages. It was from this cathedral that Frederick Barbarossa, the Holy Roman Emperor of the time, officially announced his support for the Third Crusade during the &quot;Curia Christi&quot; of 27 March 1188.

During the Middle Ages, the right to crown German kings (and queens) was given to the Archbishop of Mainz. The crowning in Mainz awarded the monarch the kingdom of Germany, and a subsequent in Rome granted him the Holy Roman Empire (a nominal difference only). Because the cathedral was damaged several times, many crownings were not held there.

The following monarchs were crowned in Mainz Cathedral:

* Conrad II on 8 September 1024 by Archbishop Aribo
* Agnes de Poitou in 1043 by Archbishop Bardo
* Rudolf of Rheinfelden (anti-king) on 26 March or 7 April 1077 by Siegfried I 
* Matilda (later wife of Henry V), on 25 July 1110 by Frederick I, Archbishop of Cologne
* Philip of Swabia on 8 September 1198 by Bishop Aimo of Tarantaise
* Frederick II on 9 December 1212 by Siegfried II of Eppstein
* Heinrich Raspe on 22 May 1246 by Siegfried III of Eppstein

<doc id="1247000" wikidata="Q6414725" url="?curid=1247000" title="Kir'Shara">
<text>&quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; is the ninth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. It was writer Michael Sussman&#x27;s third episode of the season, while it was director David Livingston&#x27;s second. The episode was the third in a three-part story arc, following on from the episodes &quot;The Forge&quot; and &quot;Awakening&quot;. The title &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; refers to a Vulcan religious relic, and the three part Vulcan story arc explored themes relating to the Protestant Reformation resulting in comparisons to books such as &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; and &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot;, while the Kir&#x27;Shara itself was compared to the Nag Hammadi library.

Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, registration NX-01. In this episode, &quot;Enterprise&quot; attempts to avert a war, and is caught in a crossfire between Vulcan and Andorian starships. Meanwhile. Captain Archer, Commander T&#x27;Pol and T&#x27;Pau aim to take the Kir&#x27;Shara to the Vulcan capital, and use it to reveal Administrator V&#x27;Las&#x27; plot to the rest of the Vulcan High Command.

In addition to the guest stars returning from the previous arc episodes, or the episode &quot;Home&quot;, Jeffrey Combs returned as Shran. The episode was shot across seven days using mostly standing sets, with only an Andorian brig built specifically for this episode. 
&quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; also saw the return of the Vulcan lirpa, a weapon which had been first introduced in the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Amok Time&quot;. The episode originally aired on December 3, 2004 on UPN. It received a Nielsen rating of 2.1/4 percent, which equalled the highest ratings seen during the fourth season. It was warmly received by critics who praised Combs&#x27; performance and noted that this episode was an indication of the improving quality of the series. However, there was mixed opinion regarding the ending of the episode.

==Plot==
&quot;Enterprise&quot; heads to Andoria after Ambassador Soval informs them that the Vulcans believe they have been developing Xindi weapon technology. Soval guides &quot;Enterprise&quot; to a nebula where the Andorian fleet is hiding. Commander Shran is dubious, and abducts and tortures Soval. After believing him, &quot;Enterprise&quot; joins a fleet of six Andorian ships to intercept the Vulcans. Commander Tucker attempts to buy time by ordering &quot;Enterprise&quot; directly between the two fleets — this works for a while until Administrator V&#x27;Las orders them to be targeted too.

Meanwhile, at The Forge, Captain Archer, Commander T&#x27;Pol and T&#x27;Pau, having found the sacred Kir&#x27;Shara (which the Syrrannites believe will usher a Vulcan enlightenment), endeavor to take it to the capital. En route, T&#x27;Pol and T&#x27;Pau discuss the taboo of mind-melds, and T&#x27;Pau offers to mind-meld with T&#x27;Pol. She states the meld is safe when performed by those trained in the art, and that Pa&#x27;nar Syndrome is merely the by-product of an improperly conducted meld. The trio are then attacked by Major Talok and Vulcan commandos, and T&#x27;Pol is captured while the others escape. She tells her captors that they are headed to Mount Seleya in order to mislead them from their true destination.

She is then taken to the capital. Archer and T&#x27;Pau also arrive after T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s husband, Koss, provides transporter security codes. They present the Kir&#x27;Shara to the High Command and reveal that the embassy bombing was merely a pretext to weaken the pacifist Syrrannites prior to the Andorian strike. Visibly angered, V&#x27;Las lunges for the Kir&#x27;Shara, but is stunned by High Minister Kuvak, who orders the fleet to stand down. &quot;Enterprise&quot; returns to Vulcan, and Koss visits to release T&#x27;Pol from their marriage. Meanwhile, the Vulcan High Command is dissolved, granting Earth greater autonomy, and the katra of Surak is transferred to a Vulcan high priest. V&#x27;Las, relieved of his post, meets secretly with Talok, revealed to be a Romulan agent, who states that the reunification of their worlds is only a matter of time.

==Production==
Like &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; was written by Michael Sussman and was his third script during the fourth season. David Livingston directed the episode, which was his second episode of the season having previously directed &quot;Borderland&quot;. Most of the guest stars had appeared in the previous episode &quot;Awakening&quot;, including Robert Foxworth as Administrator V&#x27;Las, Kara Zediker as T&#x27;Pau and John Rubinstein as Kuvak. In addition, Michael Reilly Burke resumes his role as Koss for the third time, having appeared in the role both in &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;The Forge&quot;. Also appearing, having appeared in &quot;Home&quot;, was Jack Donner as a Vulcan priest. Donner appeared in &quot;The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot; as the Romulan Commander Subcommander Tal. &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; also saw the return of Jeffrey Combs as the Andorian Commander Shran for the sixth time as well as Gary Graham as Ambassador Soval, who has appeared as a recurring character in &quot;Enterprise&quot; since the pilot episode &quot;Broken Bow&quot;. Todd Stashwick plays Talok, later known for his role as Captain Shaw in the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;.

Filming began on October 4, 2004 and continued until October 12. Despite the desert locations, all filming took place on soundstages. These represented a variety of places throughout the Vulcan desert-like Forge. The remaining sets used were either standing sets, or those which had been constructed for the previous two episodes. The exceptions to that were two sets to represent scenes on board Commander Shran&#x27;s Andorian vessel. The Andorian bridge set, which had been used previously in the series, had a single wall brought out of storage in order to appear as a backdrop for Shran when he appears on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; viewscreen. The Andorian brig was built specifically for this episode for scenes with Shran and Soval.

Re-appearing in &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; were the traditional Vulcan weapon, the lirpa, which was first introduced in &quot;The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Amok Time&quot;. The lirpa is a long shaft with a crescent blade on one end and a spiked cudgel on the other. Brand new props were built for this episode, modifying the original design by making them more lightweight. They were wielded in &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; by Vulcan commandos, who were all played by stunt actors in non-speaking roles. Additional stunt doubles were required for Archer, T&#x27;Pol, T&#x27;Pau and Talok while two puppeteers were needed for the Andorian antennae seen on screen.

==Themes==
&quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; followed up the events of the previous two episodes in the story arc as well some of the elements seen earlier in the season in the episode &quot;Home&quot;. &quot;The Forge&quot; sees Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and T&#x27;Pol (Jolene Blalock) travel into the Vulcan desert known as the Forge in order to find a renegade faction of Vulcans, known as the Syrrannites. During the journey, Archer has the katra of Surak transferred into him. In &quot;Awakening&quot;, the duo meet the Syrrannites and find out they are peaceful. After &quot;Enterprise&quot; leaves orbit, the Vulcans start bombarding the caves where the Syrrannites are located, killing T&#x27;Pol&#x27;s mother, T&#x27;Les (Joanna Cassidy).

Speaking about &quot;Awakening&quot;, show runner Manny Coto had previously said that he envisaged the story arc to be about a Vulcan reformation as a metaphor to the real-world 16th century Protestant Reformation with T&#x27;Pau playing the role of Martin Luther. This view was supported by the 2010 book &quot;Star Trek As Myth&quot;, which saw the original Vulcan religion prior to the Reformation arc seen from &quot;The Forge&quot; onwards as equating to the Catholic Church while the Syrannites were the Protestants. In doing so, Administrator V&#x27;Las is therefore linked to the Antichrist in much the same way that the Protestant Reformation saw the Pope as the Antichrist. In this role, the Romulans in the story take the place of the subversive devils to form an unholy alliance.

It was also suggested that the Kir&#x27;Shara itself was similar in context to the Nag Hammadi library, which was a collection of thirteen codices found in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 that date back to between the 2nd to 5th centuries. Unlike those codices, the Vulcan High Council attempts to suppress the revelation of the Kir&#x27;Shara in a similar manner to the Catholic Church&#x27;s suppression seen in other fictional works such as Dan Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; or James Redfield&#x27;s &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; was first aired in the United States on UPN on December 3, 2004. The broadcast saw the episode come in fourth place during the timeslot, with a Nielsen rating of 2.1/4 percent. This means that it was seen by 2.1 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all those watching television at the time of broadcast. It gained higher ratings than The WB, who aired &quot;What I Like About You&quot; and &quot;Grounded for Life&quot;. The ratings equalled the highest ratings of the season so far, which were previously achieved by &quot;Borderland&quot;, &quot;Cold Station 12&quot; and &quot;The Augments&quot;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; listed &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; on its Hot List for the day. &quot;IGN&quot; gave the episode 4.5 out of 5 and said that the show &quot;finally grows up and becomes a &quot;Star Trek&quot; series this week&quot;. It described &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; as &quot;far from a perfectly executed &quot;Trek&quot; story but they get enough right to make it a lot easier to overlook the few things they miss.&quot; It said that there had been an overall improvement in the fourth season, and that &quot;this could become some of the best &quot;Star Trek&quot; ever made&quot;.

Herc, in his review for &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot;, praised the reliability of Jeffrey Combs as Shran, but thought that there were no major surprises. Herc did say that the biggest shock was the revelation that the Romulans were behind the bombing of the Human Embassy. He gave it a rating of three out of five.

Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode for TrekNation, calling it an &quot;absolutely gripping episode&quot; except for the &quot;ludicrousness of the ending&quot;. She made the admission about the ending that, &quot;I suppose the Romulans had to show up at some point, I guess Vulcan is as good a place as any.&quot; She thought that the torture scenes were &quot;pointless&quot;, but was pleased with the characterization seen in Archer, T&#x27;Pol and Tucker.

Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website &quot;Jammer&#x27;s Reviews&quot; rated &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; of three out of four, noting it was &quot;not perfect, but good&quot; with an &quot;intriguing&quot; ending. Epsicokhan praised Jeffrey Combs as Shran, and thought that the torture scenes were potent but that the ending was rushed.

In Matthew Kappell&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;Star Trek as Myth: Essays on Symbol and Archetype at the Final Frontier&quot;, he said that he felt that the revelation that the previous Vulcan administration was working with the Romulans all along &quot;suddenly makes sense of years of previously incomprehensible Vulcan policy&quot; and linked to &quot;The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Unification&quot;.

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; praised casting actress Kara Zediker as the Vulcan character T&#x27;Pau. James Whitbrook of &quot;Io9&quot; highlighted this episode as a &quot;must watch&quot; episode of the series. &quot;The Digital Fix&quot; said this was the best episode of the fourth season, calling it a &quot;well-paced, satisfying resolution&quot; to the Vulcan storyline in the series. They felt the episode successfully capitalizes on the story elements established the previous episode &quot;The Forge&quot;.

== Home media release ==
The first home media release of &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot; was in the season four DVD box set of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, originally released in the United States on November 1, 2005. The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014.

<doc id="1247001" wikidata="Q6973935" url="?curid=1247001" title="NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.">
<text>National Labor Relations Board v Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation, 301 U.S. 1 (1937), was a United States Supreme Court case that upheld the constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, also known as the Wagner Act. The case represented a major expansion in the Court&#x27;s interpretation of Congress&#x27;s power under the Commerce Clause and effectively spelled the end to the Court&#x27;s striking down of New Deal economic legislation.

The case arose after the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel to rehire workers who had been fired for seeking to unionize. Jones and Laughlin refused to comply on the grounds that the Wagner Act, which had established the NLRB, was unconstitutional.

In a 5–4 decision, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes upheld the constitutionality of the Wagner Act, holding that Congress could regulate economic activities that were &quot;intrastate in character when separately considered&quot; if they held &quot;such a close and substantial relation to interstate commerce that their control is essential or appropriate to protect that commerce from burdens and obstructions.&quot; In his dissent, Associate Justice James Clark McReynolds argued that Congress&#x27;s power to regulate interstate commerce should be limited to cases in which a violation is &quot;direct and material.&quot;

==Background==
Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel, the fourth largest steel producer in the United States, was charged with discriminating against workers who wanted to join the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC). The company had fired ten employees at its plant in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, after they moved to unionize. The NLRB ruled against the company and ordered that the workers be rehired and given back pay, but Jones &amp; Laughlin refused to comply on the grounds and believed the Act to be unconstitutional. Citing Supreme Court precedent, lower courts agreed.

==Decision==

Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote the majority opinion in the case, which reversed the lower court&#x27;s ruling, in a 5–4 decision:

Justice McReynolds dissented, questioning Congress&#x27;s enhanced power under the commerce clause. Although he did not dispute Congress&#x27;s regulation of commerce between the states, he stated that Congress&#x27;s interference should be in cases where a violation is &quot;direct and material.&quot; McReynolds stated that taxation on property, for example, may indirectly but seriously affect the cost of transportation. He concluded that Congress had transcended the power granted to it by the Constitution.

<text>Disney Legends is a Hall of Fame award that is awarded by The Walt Disney Company to individuals who &quot;[have] made a significant impact on the Disney legacy.&quot; The honor was established in 1987, and was traditionally awarded annually during a special private ceremony. Since 2009, it has been awarded on a biennial basis during Disney&#x27;s D23 Expo. 

Starting in 2024, the Disney Legends awards ceremony was moved from D23 Expo&#x27;s traditional venue at the Anaheim Convention Center to the larger Honda Center down the street and was hosted by Ryan Seacrest. The ceremony was recorded and made available for streaming the next day on Disney+.

== Criteria ==

Recipients are chosen by a selection committee, formerly appointed and chaired by Disney Legend Roy E. Disney, Walt Disney&#x27;s nephew, former vice chairman and director &quot;emeritus&quot; of The Walt Disney Company. The committee consists of long-time Disney executives, historians, and other authorities. Besides the award statuette itself, each honoree is represented by a bronze commemorative plaque featuring the recipients&#x27; handprints and signature if they were living when inducted, or simply an image of the statuette emblem if the induction was posthumous. The plaques are placed on display in Legends Plaza at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, across from the Michael D. Eisner Building. 

== The award ==
Imagineer Andrea Favilli created the Disney Legends award, which is handcrafted from bronze each year. The award depicts the arm of Mickey Mouse holding a star-tipped wand.

A 14-foot sculpture replica of the award statuette sits in Legends Plaza in Burbank. An identical 14-foot sculpture replica is located outside the entrance of Disneyland Paris. It was dedicated and unveiled in 1997 and re-dedicated in 2002.

Disney describes the award as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;
The Disney Legends award has three distinct elements that characterize the contributions made by each talented recipient.
The Spiral ... stands for imagination, the power of an idea.
The Hand ... holds the gifts of skill, discipline and craftsmanship.
The Wand and the Star ... represent magic: the spark that is ignited when imagination and skill combine to create a new dream.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The first Disney Legends committee consisted of Dave Smith; Arlene Ludwig; Marty Sklar, Randy Bright; Jack Lindquist; Sharon Harwood; Art Levitt; Shelley Miles; Paula Sigman; Doris Smith; and Stacia Martin.

In 2017, Muppet performer Steve Whitmire alleged that the company offered him &quot;consolation prizes&quot; including the Disney Legends award in return for keeping quiet about the details surrounding his termination.

<text>Raymond Thomas Rybak Jr. (born November 12, 1955) is an American politician, journalist, businessman, and activist who served from 2002 to 2014 as the 46th mayor of Minneapolis. In 2001, Rybak, endorsed by the Minneapolis Police Federation, defeated incumbent mayor Sharon Sayles Belton by a margin of 65% to 35%, the widest margin of victory over an incumbent mayor in city history. He took office in January 2002, and was reelected in 2005 and 2009. In December 2012, he announced that he would not run for another term and would concentrate on his family. Rybak called being mayor his &quot;dream job&quot;.

Before being elected mayor, Rybak worked in journalism, business and activism. The first mayor of a major U.S. city to endorse Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 campaign for president, Rybak was one of five vice chairs of the Democratic National Committee.

== Background ==
Rybak grew up in Minneapolis, the son of Lorraine Ann (née Palmer) and Raymond Thomas Rybak, a pharmacist. He is partly of Czech descent. He graduated from Breck School in 1974 and from Boston College in 1978.

After returning to Minneapolis, in the 1970s and &#x27;80s Rybak worked as a journalist for the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune.&quot; He became managing editor of the &quot;Twin Cities Reader&quot;, where he also launched &quot;Q Monthly,&quot; a local gay and lesbian newspaper. For a few years, he headed Internet Broadcasting Systems, which started as an online division of Minneapolis television station WCCO and runs websites for many stations across the country. Rybak did consulting work as an Internet strategist and assisted with some projects with Minnesota Public Radio and Public Radio International.

He also acted as Development Director for Minneapolis&#x27;s Downtown Council. During this time, Rybak worked as a community and political activist. In 1994, he was campaign manager for Tony Bouza, the former Minneapolis chief of police who unsuccessfully sought the DFL nomination for governor of Minnesota. Rybak was an early member of the group ROAR (&quot;Residents Opposed to Airport Racket&quot;), which campaigned for noise mitigation projects in neighborhoods around the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. The group staged a memorable &quot;pajama protest&quot; in which area residents wore their nighttime clothes at the airport to show that they were losing sleep because of airplane noise.

Rybak serves on the board of directors of Nice Ride Minnesota, a public bicycle-sharing program.

== Mayoralty ==

In 2001, Rybak defeated incumbent mayor Sharon Sayles Belton, receiving 57,739 votes (64.7%) to her 30,896 (34.6%).

Rybak&#x27;s mayoralty focused mostly on reducing crime, creating jobs, building affordable housing, and balancing the city budget. He regularly attended public events and participated directly in discussions of city issues on his Facebook page. He notably crowd-surfed while mayor, diving from the stage during a &quot;Rock for Democracy&quot; event at the Minneapolis club First Avenue in July 2004.

In 2002, Rybak developed the City of Lakes Loppet, a 35-kilometer urban cross-country ski race through Theodore Wirth Park and across Cedar Lake, Lake of the Isles, and Bde Maka Ska, which ends on the streets of the Uptown Minneapolis. The event attracts nearly 2,000 skiers. Rybak is a skier and has participated in races.

Rybak made many public appearances at rallies and protests. In 2004, he spoke to a rally of striking Metro Transit workers at the Hennepin County Government Center plaza. Like many Twin Cities politicians, he marched in the annual Twin Cities Pride Parade.

In his 2005 reelection campaign Rybak defeated challenger (and fellow DFLer) Peter McLaughlin by nearly 25 percentage points, 61.5% to 36.7%. He celebrated with another crowd-surf.
In August 2007, after the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge, Rybak asked Governor Tim Pawlenty and Minnesota state officials to implement its replacement, ensuring that the new bridge would be capable of handling mass transit. Rybak pushed to ensure that future needs and policy considerations would not be ignored in the rush to build a replacement. The resulting plan accommodated a light rail line. Rybak said, &quot;we [the city] have a vision that we believe will be for a bridge that will serve us for many years to come.&quot; His role also involved authorizing municipal consent of the final bridge replacement.

Rybak was listed as a finalist for the 2008 World Mayor award. In June 2008, he was elected Vice President for Communications of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors.

According to DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Rybak was the first mayor of a large U.S. city to endorse Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2007. He campaigned for Obama and was active in the campaign&#x27;s youth wing.

In January 2009, Rybak announced his intention to run for reelection to a third term.

In March 2009, Rybak proposed eliminating the Minneapolis Civil Rights Investigations Division, which was established in 1967 to investigate discriminatory practices as part of the city&#x27;s Civil Rights Department. The plan was met by community opposition, with both the DFL African American Caucus and the Minneapolis Urban League speaking out against it. During his mayoralty, Rybak went through six civil rights directors and decreased the number of workers in the department.

On November 3, 2009, Rybak was elected to a third term, winning more than 73.6% of the first-place votes.

Rybak&#x27;s office regularly used social media including Twitter to alert followers to vital city information. 

Rybak chose not to run for a fourth term. His mayoralty ended on January 2, 2014, when Betsy Hodges was sworn in as the city&#x27;s 47th mayor. After leaving office, Rybak became executive director of Generation Next, an organization seeking to help close the achievement gap for minority students. He is now president and CEO of the Minneapolis Foundation.

== 2010 gubernatorial campaign ==
On November 5, 2009, Rybak filed paperwork creating a campaign for governor of Minnesota. A month later, he officially announced his candidacy at the Varsity Theater in Minneapolis. Rybak won the straw poll on February 2, 2010, at Minnesota&#x27;s precinct caucus events statewide.

At the DFL convention on April 24, 2010, Rybak withdrew his name from consideration for the nomination after six ballots. He endorsed Margaret Anderson Kelliher, and called on Democrats remaining in the race to withdraw and support her. Former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton subsequently won the nomination and the general election.

== Other work ==
Living Cities, a philanthropic collaborative of 22 foundations and financial institutions, reported that Rybak was hired in May 2014 as a senior advisor for municipal practice. Living Cities members include Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley.

In September 2011, Rybak became vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

== Personal life ==
Rybak lives in the city&#x27;s East Harriet neighborhood with his wife, Megan, and their children, Charlie and Grace. Like their father, the Rybak children have attended Breck School, an Episcopal private school. Rybak&#x27;s mother worked there during a difficult period in his childhood. Rybak was awarded Breck&#x27;s Distinguished Alumnus award in 2002, and spoke at the school&#x27;s commencement ceremony in 2015.

On January 4, 2014, Rybak was cross-country skiing when he started experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath. He was hospitalized and received an angioplasty and stents after it was determined he had had a heart attack. Heart problems run in his family.

Rybak has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue. The mural recognizes performers who have played sold-out shows or otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis&quot;, according to journalist Steve Marsh. Rybak is one of the few non-musicians to have a star on the mural.

<text>Lisa Ruth Germano (born June 27, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Indiana. Her album &quot;Geek the Girl&quot; (1994) was chosen as a top album of the 1990s by &quot;Spin&quot; magazine. She began her career as a violinist for John Mellencamp. , she has released thirteen albums.

==Early life==
Germano was born in Mishawaka, Indiana, one of six children of violinist Rocco and Betty Germano. She studied music, including piano and violin, as a child. When she was seven, she composed a fifteen-minute opera for the piano.

==Career==
===On the road with Mellencamp===
Germano was working as a violinist when rock singer John Mellencamp invited her to play on his album. For seven years she toured and recorded as a member of Mellencamp&#x27;s band, appearing on &quot;The Lonesome Jubilee&quot; (1987), &quot;Big Daddy&quot; (1989), &quot;Falling from Grace&quot; (1991), &quot;Human Wheels&quot; (1993), and &quot;Dance Naked&quot; (1994). Germano played with Mellencamp from 1985 to 1993 before leaving in 1994 to pursue a solo career. During the 1980s she also appeared on albums by Simple Minds and the Indigo Girls.

Mellencamp&#x27;s 2023 Live and In Person tour marked the return of Lisa Germano to Mellencamp&#x27;s band. Germano also played violin on &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;, marking the first Mellencamp studio album she has played on since 1993&#x27;s Human Wheels.

===Solo career===
After recording with Henry Lee Summer, Bob Seger, and Carrie Newcomer, Germano began a solo career with the album &quot;On the Way Down from the Moon Palace&quot; (1991), recorded in Indianapolis and released by her label, Major Bill Records. Although sales were low, the album got the attention of Capitol Records, which signed her to a contract and released her next album &quot;Happiness&quot; (1993). Personnel changes at Capitol resulted in the departure of most of her benefactors, but she retained the rights to her album.

===Working for a British label===
She signed a contract with the British label 4AD, which had a manufacturing and distribution deal with Warner Bros. in the U.S. Ivo Watts-Russell, founder and president of 4AD, was a fan of Germano&#x27;s work. He remixed some of the tracks from &quot;Happiness&quot; with producer and engineer John Fryer, who had been involved in Watts-Russell&#x27;s This Mortal Coil project. In early 1994, 4AD issued &quot;Inconsiderate Bitch&quot;, a limited-edition EP which contained five of the remixed tracks. In April of that year &quot;Happiness&quot; was reissued with different artwork, mixing, sequencing. Two tracks, including a cover version of &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot;, were replaced.

Germano&#x27;s album &quot;Geek the Girl&quot; (1994) was reviewed positively by the press 

&quot;Excerpts From a Love Circus&quot; (1996) was praised by &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Earlier that year, Watts-Russell approached 4AD&#x27;s musicians with the idea that each act would find another person or band to collaborate with on three songs. The recordings would then be released by the label as a monthly series of EPs. Germano worked with rock band Giant Sand, but after their tracks had been recorded, the label decided that the series would be unfeasible and rejected the idea. Germano and the members of Giant Sand liked the results and enjoyed collaborating, and despite the labels&#x27; lack of interest in the recordings, recorded an album in less than a week. Managers for Germano and Giant Sand made a deal with Thirsty Ear Recordings to release the album as a one-off project under the name OP8, and the album &quot;Slush&quot; was released in February 1997. In April 1997, 4AD began promoting &quot;I Love a Snot&quot; (remixed by Tchad Blake) to radio and retail stores in America, but sales of the album remained static at best. &quot;Lovesick&quot; from &quot;Excerpts from a Love Circus&quot; was remixed by Trevor Jackson (a.k.a. The Underdog), and released by his label, Output Recordings.

Sales began to sag noticeably with the release of &quot;Slide&quot;, produced by Tchad Blake, in July 1998. The distribution deal with Warner Bros. ended, returning 4AD to independent status, and without Warner Bros. &quot;Slide&quot; received less promotion. Before the album was released she was invited to sing backup vocals on tour for The Smashing Pumpkins. Although she rejected the offer at first, singer Billy Corgan persuaded her that she would have a more collaborative role, and she agreed to join the tour. She rehearsed with the band for four weeks in Chicago. The night before the tour was supposed to begin, Corgan dismissed her (via the tour manager) with no explanation.

Intent on resuming the promotion of &quot;Slide&quot;, she went on tour, opening for the Eels and then headlining smaller clubs. While on tour she was notified by 4AD that they were dropping her from the label. By the end of 1998, she announced that she was done with the music business. She fired her management. Nonetheless, in 1999 she performed in Toronto at Lee&#x27;s Palace, and continued to release new albums with various labels.

<text>&quot;Chosen&quot; is the series finale of the American television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. It is the 22nd episode of the seventh season and the 144th episode of the series overall. It was both written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon, and originally aired on UPN on May 20, 2003. The &quot;Buffy&quot; story would not be continued beyond this point until &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;, a comic book, in 2007 and the &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; saga would end in the Season Twelve series in late 2018.

==Plot==
A bloody Caleb rises and Buffy finally kills him with the scythe by slicing him in two from the crotch up. Angel has brought an amulet intended to be worn by someone ensouled, yet more than human. He tells her he will fight alongside her, but she turns him down, asking him to instead organize a second front in case she loses to the First Evil. They discuss Spike, his soul, and Buffy&#x27;s feelings for him, with Angel clearly unsettled and jealous. When Angel asks whether he has a place in her future, Buffy explains that she still needs to grow up; there might be a future for them, but it will be a long time coming, if ever. Accepting this, Angel walks into the shadows, just like on the night they first met. As all this occurs, Spike watches unseen, with the First in Buffy&#x27;s form by his side.

Back at the house, Dawn angrily kicks Buffy in the shin for having Xander try to take her away from Sunnydale. Spike is in the basement, working out his anger on a punching bag with a crude drawing of Angel&#x27;s face on it. He asks for the amulet, and she explains that it is very powerful and meant only for a champion. She then hands it to him. When Buffy tells Spike coyly that Faith is still sleeping in her room, he is reluctant to have her stay downstairs with him since she kissed Angel, but gives in. Late at night, as Buffy and Spike are sleeping in each other&#x27;s arms, the First appears to taunt Buffy in the form of Caleb, and then in the form of Buffy herself. Its words give Buffy a plan; when Spike wakes up, Buffy tells him that she now knows that they will win.

The next morning, Buffy unveils her plan to the Potential Slayers off-camera. Afterward, Willow expresses to Kennedy her concerns about using magic again. She says this is the most powerful magic she will have attempted and asks Kennedy to kill her if it turns bad. Faith and Principal Wood also have a discussion while preparing the school for the battle. Wood demonstrates that he understands her defensiveness over getting emotionally involved with men and asks her to give him a chance after the battle. During the night, Buffy goes to the basement, where she apparently spends her last night with Spike.

The next morning, everyone arrives at Sunnydale High in a yellow school bus. The Slayers and the Potentials head to the seal in the basement while Kennedy helps Willow set up her spell in Wood&#x27;s office, Andrew is paired with Anya, Dawn leaves to set up her post with Xander, and Wood leaves to wait at his post for Giles. The core four share a moment talking about going to the mall after saving the world which causes Giles to say &quot;the earth is definitely doomed.&quot; Xander and Willow walk down the hallway with Buffy before each one peels off, leaving Buffy walking alone to the seal. The Potentials, Faith and Spike are waiting, and the Potentials cut their hands to open the seal with their blood. They climb down the hole in the ground and come face to face with the army of Turok-Han. The Ubervamps spot Buffy, Faith and the Potentials, and attack.

Willow sits in the school principal&#x27;s office directly above the Seal, the scythe before her. While chanting a spell, she places her hands on the scythe, and both she and the weapon light up in an ethereal glow and her hair turns white, the opposite of Dark Willow. A flashback to Buffy&#x27;s final speech to the Potentials reveals that Willow is channeling the essence of the scythe in order to activate Potentials all over the world. Defying the tradition of only one slayer per generation, Willow&#x27;s spell will raise an army strong enough to do battle with The First. After Willow performs the magic, Kennedy takes the scythe to Buffy, who is deep in the fight with Faith and Spike against the army of the Turok-Han, numbering in the thousands.

As she pauses to give orders, Buffy is stabbed through her abdomen from behind by a Turok-Han and falls to the ground. She passes the scythe to Faith and asks her to hold the line. As she lies on the ground, she sees several Slayers fall, including Amanda. In the halls of the school, a few Turok-Han make it to the surface and attack the group guarding the entrances. A small group of Bringers also appear and attack. During the battle, Anya is bisected by a Bringer, Andrew fights until he is overwhelmed, Wood is stabbed by a Bringer who is then killed by Giles, and Xander and Dawn take on some Turok-Han who are disintegrated by sunlight when Dawn throws open a skylight window, but more follow. In the Hellmouth, the First then appears to Buffy as a mortally wounded Buffy herself, taunting her. Ordering The First to &quot;get out of my face!&quot;, Buffy arises with renewed determination and knocks several Turok-Han off the ledge. Other Slayers are reinvigorated as well.

Just then, Spike&#x27;s amulet consumes him in blue light and blasts a hole upward into the sky. The sunlight is channeled through his soul to the amulet and in powerful rays that begin dusting the ubervamps. The ground begins to shake and rocks tumble. The few surviving Slayers start to flee. Buffy tells Spike to do so as well, but he insists on finishing it. They share a quiet moment as the world crumbles around them. With tears in her eyes, Buffy tells Spike she loves him (as predicted by Cassie months earlier); Spike dismisses her declaration but thanks her for it. He orders her to leave as he has to stay and finish the job. As Buffy flees, Spike burns to dust as the Hellmouth collapses.

On the way out of the school, Xander yells for Anya, whose body lies nearby unseen as Dawn pulls him out. The survivors board a school bus and flee. Buffy runs across rooftops to catch up, and leaps onto the top of the bus. The entire town of Sunnydale collapses into the Hellmouth cavern, leaving a large crater. As the ground stops shaking, Andrew comforts Xander by telling him that Anya died saving his life. While a few of the new Slayers tend to the wounded, the other survivors look back at the crater&#x27;s rim. As Willow and Dawn ponder what to do next, Buffy slowly begins to smile, knowing that she is no longer alone in the world and that the burden of being the one chosen Slayer is no longer on her shoulders.

==Production details==
Originally the series finale was planned as a two-hour event. However, UPN only ordered 22 episodes instead of the required 23. This was why stories were so rushed at the end, according to Gellar.

===Writing===
*Season seven explores the fundamental separation between the Slayer and other people, which the series finale turns upside down. As J. Lichtenberg points out in her essay on heroism in the Buffyverse, Buffy is a hero because she makes her own rules. &quot;Finally an adult, Buffy rejects the fate laid out for her by the Council of Watchers and a couple of old men millennia ago,&quot; Lichtenberg writes. &quot;She finally achieves her goal of normality - not by changing her own nature, but by making others like her.&quot;
*In a BBC interview before this episode aired, writer/director Joss Whedon said, &quot;If nobody cries... then I&#x27;ve definitely failed. It&#x27;s really emotional - you&#x27;re supposed to laugh, cry and gasp with excitement - as well as take away a beautiful feminist message.&quot; He acknowledges that the magic unleashed from the scythe in this episode is &quot;somewhat convenient&quot; and that the Turok-Han vampires are far easier to kill in this episode than in previous episodes (in which Anya noted their tough chest bones make staking them extremely difficult), but as a writer, it was more important for him to get to the show&#x27;s message of empowerment by showing what Willow&#x27;s magic and Buffy&#x27;s status as the Slayer means to each of them.
*As opposed to Spike&#x27;s &quot;perfect, noble&quot; death, Whedon wanted another character to die in a &quot;real middle-of-the-battle death&quot; and to have it done &quot;brutally and suddenly and never really pay it off&quot;. Emma Caulfield stated at the beginning of season 7 that this would be her last season on &quot;Buffy&quot;, even if the show was renewed for another season, and so Caulfield was fine with having Anya be the character who was killed.
*In the DVD commentary, Whedon says that he wanted Angel to exit the show exactly like he entered, backing out into the darkness behind him.

==Reception==
&quot;Chosen&quot; attracted 4.9 million viewers on its original run. &quot;SFX&quot;, a British sci-fi magazine, listed &quot;Chosen&quot; the 8th best episode of &quot;Buffy&quot; (number one was &quot;Hush&quot;).

The episode was nominated for both a 2003 Emmy Award in the Category of Special Visual Effects for a Series, and for the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.

The Futon Critic named it the 50th best episode of 2003, saying &quot;the final &quot;Buffy&quot; from Joss Whedon&#x27;s pen was a reason to celebrate in 2003: back was the snappy dialogue we&#x27;ve come to expect from the show over the years. In essence the show came to life just as its run drew to a close. Not a bad way to go out.&quot;

In May 2013, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Chosen&quot; as number nine on their list of 20 Best TV Series Finales Ever. The &quot;L.A. Times&quot; also named the episode number 13 as their most memorable TV series finales.

Screen Rant named it an episode including some of &quot;The Best 60 Seconds From All 7 Seasons,&quot; saying the show&#x27;s &quot;most rousing and goosebump-inducing 60-second sequence ever plays out, as powerful music plays over Buffy&#x27;s inspiring words. Potentials worldwide, including Buffy&#x27;s army, become slayers, turning the tables in the fight against the First Evil.&quot;

<text>Killzone is a 2004 first-person shooter video game developed by Guerrilla Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 2. It is the first installment of the &quot;Killzone&quot; series and the first partnership between Guerrilla and Sony. A remaster developed by Supermassive Games was re-released within the &quot;Killzone Trilogy&quot; for PlayStation 3 as well as a standalone PSN title in 2012.

&quot;Killzone&quot; takes place in the middle of the 24th century and chronicles the war between two human factions; the Vektans, and the Helghast. The game is played from a first-person view and follows Jan Templar, a high-ranking officer within the Interplanetary Strategic Alliance, as he battles invading Helghast forces on his homeworld of Vekta.

Prior to its release &quot;Killzone&quot; was heavily anticipated with several publications considering it to be Sony&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Halo&quot; killer&quot; title. Upon release, however, the game was met with mixed responses, with critics praising the visuals, sound, and music, but criticizing the gameplay, AI, and technical issues. Despite mixed reactions, &quot;Killzone&quot; spawned numerous sequels, beginning with a direct sequel, &quot;Killzone 2&quot;; Sony would purchase Guerrilla in 2005.

==Plot==
&quot;Killzone&quot; takes place in a fictional world set in the year 2357. After nuclear war rendered much of the Earth uninhabitable in 2055, world governments formed an international order known as the United Colonial Nations. Partnering with private firms, the UCN moved to establish human colonies in Alpha Centauri, a system occupied by two planets: Vekta, a rich Earth-like world (named after the CEO of the mining conglomerate Helghan, Philip Vekta), and Helghan, a barren wasteland named after the same company. The Helghan Corporation sought to buy ownership of Vekta as well, but when the UCN imposed sanctions against its unfair business practices, a war broke out (known as the First Extrasolar War), which led to the ISA, the military arm of the UCN, driving the company out of Vekta. In response, the exiled colonists established their own civilization on Helghan, built on the principles of militarism and authoritarianism. The harsh environment and atmosphere killed many Helghans, forcing the survivors to use respirators and air tanks just to breathe. Eventually, the population, now known as the Helghast, mutated into pale-skinned hairless humanoids with increased strength, stamina, and intelligence. Violently xenophobic and convinced of their superiority, the Helghan consider humans to be beneath them, and dream of one day reconquering Vekta and expanding their empire to Earth and the neighboring star systems.

===Story===
Scolar Visari, emperor of Helghan, sends the Helghast Third Army to launch a secret invasion of Vekta. Alerted to the attack, the ISA attempt to prevent it with their SD (Solar Defense) network, but are unable to activate it in time to stop the invaders. With the element of surprise on their side, the Helghast quickly overwhelm the unprepared ISA ground forces and capture several strategic locations, including ISA Central Command.

While taking part in an offensive to slow the Helghast assault, Captain Jan Templar, a veteran ISA officer, is summoned to a meeting by his mentor and close friend, General Bradley Vaughton. Vaughton discloses that the ISA has requested assistance from the UCN and are working to restore the defense network. He also reveals that Colonel Gregor Hakha, a half-Helghan intelligence officer, had, on his orders, infiltrated the inner circle of Third Army commander General Joseph Lente, only to vanish while traveling to an extraction point in Vekta&#x27;s slums. As Hakha is the only individual with knowledge of how the invasion bypassed SD, he assigns Jan to locate him. After fighting his way through the Helghast occupying the exterior of Central Command, Jan runs into Luger, a former comrade who is now working with an elite ISA division known as the Shadow Marshals. He also recruits the services of Ricardo Velasquez, an ISA gunner seeking revenge for the massacre of his entire platoon.

After rescuing Hakha, the team discovers that General Stuart Adams, the overseer for SD, is secretly working for Lente. He murders Vaughton and takes control of the system, planning to use it to destroy the relief fleet headed to Vekta. Under Jan&#x27;s leadership, the team destroys several Helghast bases and infrastructure projects, eventually intercepting and killing Lente when he tries to deal with them personally. Adams retreats to the SD control center and tries to reason with the group, explaining that the Helghast will stop at nothing to reclaim Vekta, regardless of how many lives they lose. Nevertheless, the team disables the station and escapes just as the fleet destroys it, killing Adams. Jan and Luger speculate about what the future holds, realizing that the real war is far from over.

==Reception==
&quot;Killzone&quot; received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Reviewers cited technical problems with &quot;Killzone&quot;, including inconsistent AI, occasional bugs, frame-rate issues, distracting graphical glitches, repetition of the same voices, short draw distance, and an awkward control system. Critics also complained about the gameplay, with &quot;IGN&quot; labeling it &quot;underwhelming and mediocre&quot;.

Reviewers such as &quot;GameSpy&quot; claimed that &quot;Killzone&quot; partly suffered due to the incredible publicity it received before release, raising expectations only for them to go unfulfilled. Despite this, &quot;Killzone&quot; was admired for its sound effects, its soundtrack, and its presentation of a gritty war zone; it was also credited for its unique hard sci-fi art design. In Japan, where the game was ported and published by Sega in 2004, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of one seven, one nine, one eight, and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40. Despite the mixed reception, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Killzone&quot; for &quot;Console First-Person Action Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Original Musical Composition&quot; during the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

The game shipped close to 2 million units worldwide by December 2005.

<text>is a manga series by Hideyuki Kikuchi. The story has been adapted into an anime film directed by Yoshimichi Furukawa. The film was originally licensed by Central Park Media and then later licensed by ADV Films.

==Storyline==
The story involves the town of Kabuki-cho, home of a resistance faction called Messiah. In the futuristic setting, Kabuki-cho is one of the last places of freedom because the Persona Century Corporation has taken control of the majority of the Earth. Kabuki-cho is hence known as &quot;The Dark Side of Tokyo&quot;. Furthermore, a mysterious stranger called Darkside appears to protect the citizens of Kabuki-cho.

== Characters ==
; Dark Side
: When he meets Mai and the others, he asks about the name of the place, and is told it is Shinjuku Kabukicho, also known as &quot;Dark Side,&quot; so he calls himself Dark Side.

==Release==
The manga was published by Akita Shoten into two volumes between September 1988 and December 1988. The series was rereleased three times in special one-volume editions: on November 22, 1993; on May 10, 2002; and on March 16, 2012.

&quot;Darkside Blues&quot; was adapted into a film by J.C. Staff under the direction of Yoriyasu Kogawa and based on a script by Mayori Sekijima. It was released theatrically by Toho on October 8, 1994. Central Park Media licensed it for a North American audience and first released it in VHS on May 6, 1997.

== Reception ==
Helen McCarthy in &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies&quot; calls the film &quot;one of the most atmospheric films&quot; of the 1990s. She praises the design, but states that &quot;the luxuriant designs are almost outdone by the well-crafted background track, with some superior foley editing and jazzy, atmospheric music&quot;.

<text>Phoca ( ) is a genus of the earless seals, within the family Phocidae. It now contains just two species, the common seal (or harbour seal) and the spotted seal (or largha seal). Several species formerly listed under this genus have been split into the genera &quot;Pusa&quot;, &quot;Pagophilus&quot;, and &quot;Histriophoca&quot;. Until recently, &quot;Phoca largha&quot; has been considered a subspecies of &quot;Phoca vitulina&quot; but now is considered its own species. For this reason, the fossil history of the genus is unclear, and it has formerly been used as wastebasket taxon for a number of fossils of uncertain affinity.

==Species==
Currently there are two confirmed members:
There is also a third unconfirmed member:
Former members of &quot;Phoca&quot;:
* &quot;Histriophoca fasciata&quot; (ribbon seal)
* &quot;Pusa caspica&quot; (Caspian seal)
* &quot;Pusa hispida&quot; (ringed seal)
* &quot;Pusa sibirica&quot; (nerpa or Baikal seal)
* &quot;Pagophilus groenlandica&quot; (harp seal)

==Mating ecology==
Both harbour and spotted seals are aquatically mating pinnipeds. Mating occurs in the water around the time when pups are weaned. Females in estrus are typically more dispersed than land-breeding pinnipeds and the distinction between foraging and reproductive behavior is less apparent. For this reason, it is difficult to study the mating patterns of this genus.

Female harbour seals start making foraging trips shortly before weaning their pup and consequently are widely dispersed when in estrus. Males restrict their range around the time females start to make these foraging trips. Harbour seals follow a polygynous mating system. More specifically it has been shown that male harbour seals partake in lek polygyny. Male seals defend underwater territories with well-defined boundaries. The most valuable territories are near haulouts or along traffic corridors that provide maximum exposure to estrous females. One male will occupy an area throughout the breeding season, and they will return to the same display area in consecutive years. Female harbour seals receive direct benefits from being in a lek, as the congregation of males into an area makes mate selection easier because females do not have to travel as far and it also helps to reduce exposure to predators.
Harbour seal males use underwater vocalizations and display dives within their aquatic territories, for both female attraction and male-male competition. Male harbour seal vocalizations consist of low-frequency broadband growls that peak in occurrence during the mating season. Males vocalize and display in small, distinct territories covering around 40–135 m2. Each display area is spatially discrete and can be separated by up to 250 meters. Male harbour seals have considerable individual and geographic variation in their underwater vocalizations. Territory holders use the acoustic displays of intruders to locate and challenge invaders and will respond aggressively to a male call. Males assess each other by their vocalizations before deciding whether to respond. These vocalizations are energetically expensive to produce and are honest signals of male quality and dominance. Male body condition will decline as the mating season progresses.

Aquatic hierarchies in harbour seals develop before the breeding season and dominance is determined by direct male contests. These contests involve repeated confrontations between two males using surface splashing, fighting, paired somersaulting, and chasing techniques. The hierarchies may aid in holding territories or to mate with females during the breeding season. The dominance relationships are determined by size and sex, with adult males dominant to sub-adult males, and sub-adult females submissive to all other social classes. Aquatic courtship is long in duration and involves rolling, bubble blowing, and splashing to attract females. Female choice appears to play a strong role in this mating system but it has yet to be formally studied.

The mating system of spotted seals is quite different from harbour seals as spotted seals are serially monogamous. During the breeding season, a male will join a female approximately ten days before the female gives birth to a pup from the previous years mating. The pairs are considered to be territorial as they keep widely spaced from other spotted seals. The social group consists of an isolated adult pair and the females pup. The female spotted seal receives direct benefits from the male as he provides protection for her and the pup until it is weaned. Immediately after weaning mating occurs.

<doc id="1247036" wikidata="Q3180485" url="?curid=1247036" title="Yuri Sakazaki">
<text>is a character from SNK&#x27;s &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; fighting game series. She first appears in the original &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; being kidnapped by Mr. Big, a criminal from the city of South Town. The players, Yuri&#x27;s brother Ryo and his friend Robert Garcia spend the game searching for her. In the sequel, Yuri makes her playable debut, having been trained by her father Takuma in the art of Kyokugen Karate. Yuri has also starred in the anime adaptation of &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, in which she reprises her role from the first game. Yuri was initially designed as a weak damsel in distress who would become one of SNK&#x27;s first female fighters following a positive response from Mai Shiranui in their related IP &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;. To overcome her weak body, SNK designers decided to make her mimic other fighters&#x27; moves, most notably the ones from Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. Several actresses have lent their voices to Yuri since her debut.

She has been featured in several games from &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, with the notable exception of &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot;, participating in the annual tournaments from each title. She initially starts in the Women Fighters Team, but she later moves to the Art of Fighting Team along with her family. She was also featured in the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; crossover series as well as in &quot;SNK Gals&#x27; Fighters&quot;. Critics have generally praised her transition from being a damsel in distress to becoming a fighter in the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series. Her inclusion in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series was noted to give her more variety in her movesets which would appeal to gamers as well as a positive portrayal of fantasy karate and female inclusion in gaming.

==Creation and design==

Yuri was created by the SNK member woman spoiled by her older brother Ryo Sakazaki who has to rescue her in the first &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; video game. Although she was given a tragic past due to her mother&#x27;s death and her father&#x27;s disappearance, SNK gave her an upbeat character. For the character voices, they used all pro or semi-pro voice actors. Yuri and King were done by the same person: Harumi Ikoma. Kaori Horie provided her voice from &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; to &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;. SNK developer Yasuyuki Oda reflected that both &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and the other IP &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; seemed to appeal to fans of male-oriented series like &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. The inclusion of several macho fighters led to the dilemma of including more female characters with Mai Shiranui standing out as SNK&#x27;s first female fighter. With Mai&#x27;s high popularity in &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, SNK decided to include Yuri in &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; as a playable character which received similar response. Yuri&#x27;s popularity led to the creation of unique characters related to her but none of them made it to the actual game until her ending sequence. Additionally, the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; staff wanted Yuri to appear in the game, thus, she was added to the Women Fighters Team as the leader. Once it was announced Yuri would be a playable character in &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot;, the staff behind &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; wanted her to be part of the cast. She replaced the character Big Bear from King&#x27;s team due to memory issues. Afterwards, the team added Mai Shiranui to the team and formed the Women&#x27;s Team. Yuri&#x27;s designer said the character had some bosom animation but not as much as Mai; she spent much work on Yuri&#x27;s calves. During the development of &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, there were no female fighter teams, and King, Billy Kane, and Big Bear were planned to appear as the &quot;British team&quot;, but due to the development staff&#x27;s request to include Yuri, she was replaced with Big Bear, who required a lot of space, and Mai was added to form the female fighter team.

According to a staff member, Yuri in the &quot;KOF&quot; series learns techniques that are reminiscent of someone&#x27;s technique with each new title. This was done by director Toyohisa Tanabe as he believed Capcom was ahead of their company when creating the Ryo&#x27;s parody character Dan Hibiki in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;. Ever since her introduction in &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, Yuri was a weak character who becomes a fighter in a year, using her family&#x27;s Kyokugen Karate style. Tanabe decided to make Yuri a strong character despite her background, and often borrow techniques from Capcom fighting games out of respect and a fast fashion. &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; writer Akihiko Ureshino describes Yuri as a &quot;the greatest genius,&quot; probably because, although she was originally a girl who was good at sports, it only took her one year to master the secret techniques of her father after she started to train in karate seriously. However, that does not mean that Yuri is the strongest. When discussing genius in the sense of being able to quickly grasp something, then Yuri may indeed be the best. However, Ryo&#x27;s dedication to the Kyokugen Ryu made him become the strongest student from the dojo. While Yuri&#x27;s adult life was portrayed in SNK games besides small mentions in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, Ureshino believes Yuri might become a mother on such a timeline and her child would either succeed Ryo&#x27;s dojo once her brother has retired.

By 1997, when &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; was at its peak with the Orochi story arc, new works in the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series had already stopped being released. As a result, he recalls fans believing Ryo and Yuri were original &quot;KOF&quot; characters. They tend to be unable to get involved in the main story and end up in comical roles, but Ryo and the others are more serious characters. For this reason, Ureshino thinks many fans do not want to accept Ryo and the others in &quot;KOF&quot;. &quot;&quot; marks the first time since &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; that she has received a new outfit that is composed of a green camo print shirt, short pants, dark green gloves and green shoes. In &quot;&quot;, some of her extra normal outfits make her look like fellow Kyokugen practitioners; color scheme B makes her look like Ryo (blond hair, orange gi and black tights), while scheme F resembles Robert Garcia&#x27;s outfit from &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; to &quot;2002&quot;, which consists of brown hair, orange gi with black long-sleeved tights, and no headband.

In making Yuri for &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, director Kei Yamamoto stated Yuri wanted the character&#x27;s moves to focus on kicks something which clashed with Robert Garcia&#x27;s style who also used the same fighting style. Due to the skill required to perform some of her special attacks, Yamamoto feels Yuri&#x27;s players to train themselves in order to use her properly. There was originally an attempt to give the character one of Robert Garcia&#x27;s moves because of both of them handling their lower limbs, but was removed due to not fitting Yuri. Yuri&#x27;s redesign gave the staff a good impression of how her sprites changed, especially liking the universal lower body due to her combination of white gi and blue pants. For &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, while Yuri retained the same look, SNK aimed to give her character a relaxing theme song when the player fights against the Art of Fighting Team. Similar to previous games, if Yuri is defeated with a special attack, part of her white gi is damaged. Her voice actress was replaced with Ai Kakuma. While in &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, Yuri was given short hair, the SNK staff decided to give her back her braids for &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; in order to make her look more beautiful and give the game a more nostalgic view while still retaining tomboyish style. Outside gaming, Ayumi Hamasaki voiced Yuri in the TV anime special and portrayed her in an &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; commercial. Veronica Taylor dubbed Yuri in the English dub. In a drama CD, she was voiced by Sakura Tange.

==Appearances==
===Video games===
Although Yuri is not playable in the first &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; game, she plays a big role in the plot as she is kidnapped by the Southtown criminal Mr. Big, causing Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia to search for her throughout the game. In the end, Ryo and Robert fight Mr. Karate, a soldier from Mr. Big taking Yuri as a hostage, but they are stopped by Yuri who reveals that he is Takuma. In &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot;, Yuri becomes a playable character, being trained by Takuma after the events from the previous game. Yuri enters the King of Fighters tournament along with Ryo, Robert and Takuma in order to defeat Geese Howard, the criminal who turned Takuma into Mr. Karate. In &quot;Art of Fighting 3&quot;, Yuri is once again unplayable, but she appears along with Ryo searching for Robert, who was helping a childhood friend known as Freya Lawrence. Yuri starts also to be attracted to Robert, something noted by Ryo to the point of telling her to accompany on a journey at the ending.

Yuri is also a playable character in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series first as part of the Women Fighters Team along with Mai Shiranui and King participating in the annual King of Fighters tournaments often switching with her family&#x27;s Art of Fighting Team. Her latest appearance is in &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; alongside Athena and Mai as part of the new &quot;Team Super Heroine&quot;.Yuri appears in multiple spin-off games including &quot;The King of Fighters Neowave&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot; as a potential recruit for lead character Kyo Kusanagi and friend. She appears as an assistant character in &quot;The King of Fighters EX&quot; for the Art of Fighting Team, and as a playable character in &quot;The King of Fighters EX2&quot;. She is also featured in the spin-offs &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; participating in new tournaments from Southtown. The spin-offs &quot;King of Fighters R-1&quot; and &quot;King of Fighters R-2&quot; feature Yuri as part of the Super Babe Team alongside Athena and Kasumi Todoh. Although Yuri does not appear in the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, she is mentioned of having her own fitness gym in the upcoming &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot; as Ryo&#x27;s student Marco Rodriguez uses her gym to train.

Additionally, she stars in most games from the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; series except &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot; (where she makes a cameo appearance in Ryo&#x27;s and Mr. Karate&#x27;s endings). In the crossover &quot;SNK Gals&#x27; Fighters&quot; Yuri appears as a playable character with her wanting to start her own gym, while she also appears in &quot;SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy&quot;. She is furthermore present in the cellphone games such as &quot;KOF Gals Mahjong&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98 Ultimate Match Online&quot;, &quot;The King of Fighters All Star&quot; and &quot;Kimi wa Hero&quot;. Her character design serves as downloadable content in &quot;Dead or Alive 5 Last Round&quot;, as well as &quot;Lucent Heart&quot;. In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, she has a cameo appearance as a background character on the King of Fighters Stadium stage.

===Other appearances===
Yuri appears in various SNK manga and in the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; anime adaptation which retells the story from the first game but with Mr. Big wanting to obtain a diamond that Ryo and Robert found. She is voiced by Ayumi Hamasaki in the Japanese version and by Veronica Taylor in the English dub. In Shinkiro&#x27;s manga, Yuri&#x27;s backstory is told as it is revealed Ryo was raised following Takuma&#x27;s disappearance. She is briefly mentioned in &quot;Buriki One&quot; by a middle aged Ryo. For &quot;The King of Fighters Destiny&quot;, Yuri has a disagreement with her family over the idea of competition, resulting in the formation of the Women Fighters Team. Additionally, a oneshot retells the first game but with Ryo saving Yuri from King. She is also featured in &quot;The King of Fighters: A New Beginning&quot;, facing Meitenkun. An alternate Yuri also appears in the isekai light novel &quot;The King of Fantasy&quot; siding with fellow character Iori Yagami who finds himself lost in this world where Yuri lives. An action figure of her character was released by SNK Playmore. Many statuette figures have been released by various manufacturers.

==Promotion and reception==

Tiago Frosi (2010) and Felipe Frosi (2010) from Universidade Federal do Ceará reference Yuri Sakazaki from the game &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; claiming that she was a replica of the idealized stereotype for women, a young woman dressed in pink, fragile and who must be rescued by strong and courageous characters. An initial model that went against the emancipation achieved by women in this period. In later versions, the character Yuri presents herself as a karate-ka. In the game&#x27;s story, she is trained by her father and goes against all of her brother&#x27;s sexist ideas, characterizing the example of women&#x27;s transformation within the game. The character also became an icon among the female audience in Japan. In the magazine &quot;Paletta&quot;, she was highlighted as an imprisoned heroine who becomes talented fighters in the world in a single year. The writer was impressed by the change of the character&#x27;s personality following &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; as she acts more energectic and has a more notable sex appeal. Just like in &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot;, Yuri was also a surprising character in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; for being one of the most memorable and surprising fighting game figures.

A &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; maid cafe was done in 2017 in Osaka, where not only drinks inspired by Yuri&#x27;s character were made but maids also appeared wearing Yuri&#x27;s outfit. In an &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; commercial, Yuri was portrayed by her own voice actress Ayumi Hamasaki whom the writer praised for keeping in-character during the entire video. Hardcore Gaming 101 regarded her as &quot;SNK’s Capcom style character&quot; sharing Ryu and Ken&#x27;s moves. They criticized her portrayal in the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; OVA for being unrecognizable. In retrospect, GamingBolt regarded her as one of the most popular characters in early &quot;KOF&quot; especially when she mimics moves from &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters.

Tiago O. Frosi from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul regarded Yuri as one of the most impactful female characters in fighting game history due to how she initially debuts as a damsel in distress only to become a playable character both in the sequel and SNK&#x27;s crossover video games. She was compared with &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Sakura Kasugano for having similar archetypes as well as an imitated fighting style from veteran fighters. Manga artist Nobuhiro Watsuki designed the character of Makimachi Misao for the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; manga series with similarities to Mai Shiranui and Yuri, comically saying he was &quot;making his own grave&quot; due to the similarities with the SNK characters.

Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; described her as adding to her family&#x27;s &quot;wonderful comedic existence&quot;, but felt she was more at place there than in King of Fighters as part of the Women&#x27;s Team. He added &quot;She&#x27;s not quite Sakura and she&#x27;s not quite Dan Hibiki, but she&#x27;s fine for what she is,&quot; and praised her departure from a damsel in distress to a full character as the games progressed. Den of Geek also noted that the Art of Fighting Team in general has been characterized as more comical characters in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; than in &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; though in &quot;XI&quot; they accidentally created their own rival which further expands the humor. In retrospect, Tiago Oviedo Frosi wrote that Gichin Funakoshi&#x27;s &quot;Shōtōkan&quot; is the most practiced style of Karate in the world, this was the style chosen to characterize most of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters. The Kyokugenryu the cast uses in &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; instead comes across as a fantasy version of the &quot;knockout&quot; Kyokushinkaikan created by Mas Oyama who serves as an influence for both Ryu&#x27;s and Yuri&#x27;s characters. However, most of Yuri&#x27;s variations of the Kyokugen style are deemed as comic gags which she copies. DieHardGameFan referred to the young fighter as &quot;wonderful adorable obnoxious completely batshit ludicrous Yuri&quot; due to how hilarious she is, making it his favorite SNK fighter as well as superior to the &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; characters he also enjoys. As a result, he enjoyed Yuri&#x27;s debut in &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; as a playable character due to her hilarious interactions.

Elvortex noted that Yuri became popular for acting as SNK&#x27;s own response to Dan Hibiki as she also starts parodying &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters especially Ryu by imitating their own moves in several &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; games. Geek.com considered this a &quot;game wars&quot; as the two companies kept referencing each other since the creation of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and the latter characters felt like jokes in general from each side. The story of Ryo and Robert saving Yuri was found highly popular by Hardcore Gaming 101 comparable to the narrative of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, which led to multiple parodies by Capcom in several of their games.

VG247 praised her addition to &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; thanks to her appealing fighting style involving notable impact which earned her the nickname of &quot;Wild Flying Swallow&quot; and also liked her upbeat personality. Eurogamer regarded her as one of the most charming characters created by SNK since &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; and how &quot;KOF&quot; integrated her into its series. GeneracionXbox noted that while Yuri employs the same fighting style as Ryo and Robert, she provides her own diversed form while her trailer for &quot;KOFXV&quot; appealed to &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; fans for putting her in the same stage as Richard Meyer from the same series.

<text>Marcel Grossmann (April 9, 1878 – September 7, 1936) was a Swiss mathematician who was a friend and classmate of Albert Einstein. Grossmann came from an old Swiss family in Zürich. His father managed a textile factory. He became a Professor of Mathematics at the Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich, today the ETH Zurich, specializing in descriptive geometry.

==Career==
In 1900 Grossmann graduated from the Federal Polytechnic School (ETH) and became an assistant to the geometer Wilhelm Fiedler. He continued to do research on non-Euclidean geometry and taught in high schools for the next seven years. In 1902, he earned his doctorate from the University of Zurich with the thesis &quot;Ueber die metrischen Eigenschaften kollinearer Gebilde&quot; (translated &quot;On the Metrical Properties of Collinear Structures&quot;) with Fiedler as advisor. In 1907, he was appointed full professor of descriptive geometry at the Federal Polytechnic School.

As a professor of geometry, Grossmann organized summer courses for high school teachers. In 1910, he became one of the founders of the Swiss Mathematical Society. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1912 at Cambridge and in 1920 at Strasbourg.

===Collaborations with Albert Einstein===
Albert Einstein&#x27;s friendship with Grossmann began with their school days in Zürich. Grossmann&#x27;s careful and complete lecture notes at the Federal Polytechnic School proved to be a salvation for Einstein, who missed many lectures. Grossmann&#x27;s father helped Einstein get his job at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, and it was Grossmann who helped to conduct the negotiations to bring Einstein back from Prague as a professor of physics at the Zurich Polytechnic. Grossmann was an expert in differential geometry and tensor calculus; just the mathematical tools providing a proper mathematical framework for Einstein&#x27;s work on gravity. Thus, it was natural that Einstein would enter into a scientific collaboration with Grossmann.

It was Grossmann who emphasized the importance of a non-Euclidean geometry called Riemannian geometry (also elliptic geometry) to Einstein, which was a necessary step in the development of Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity. Abraham Pais&#x27;s book on Einstein suggests that Grossmann mentored Einstein in tensor theory as well. Grossmann introduced Einstein to the absolute differential calculus, started by Elwin Bruno Christoffel and fully developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita. Grossmann facilitated Einstein&#x27;s unique synthesis of mathematical and theoretical physics in what is still today considered the most elegant and powerful theory of gravity: the general theory of relativity. The collaboration of Einstein and Grossmann led to a ground-breaking paper, &quot;Outline of a Generalized Theory of Relativity and of a Theory of Gravitation&quot;, which was published in 1913 and was one of the two fundamental papers which established Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravity.

==Death==
Grossmann died of multiple sclerosis in 1936. The community of relativists celebrates Grossmann&#x27;s contributions to physics by organizing Marcel Grossmann meetings every three years.

== Legacy ==
The International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics presents the Marcel Grossmann Awards. Each recipient receives a silver casting of the T. E. S. T. sculpture by the artist A. Pierelli. Each year, an institution is selected and between two and six individual scientists are selected. Past institutional winners include the Planck Scientific Collaboration (ESA), AlbaNova University Center, Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifique (IHES) and others. Past individual winners include Shing-Tung Yau, Tsung-Dao Lee, Christine Jones Forman and Stephen Hawking.

<doc id="1247045" wikidata="Q1680814" url="?curid=1247045" title="Unity Temple">
<text>Unity Temple is a Unitarian Universalist church building that houses the Unity Temple Unitarian Universalist Congregation at 875 Lake Street in Oak Park, Illinois, United States. The structure, designed by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright in the Prairie style, is cited as an early example of modern architecture. The building consists of an auditorium to the north and a church house called Unity House to the south. The two sections, and an entrance pavilion between them, are all made of reinforced concrete.

The congregation was formed as the Unity Church of Oak Park in 1871. It originally occupied a Gothic Revival building and went through several pastors in its first two decades. Rodney Johonnot, who became the senior pastor in 1892, began planning a replacement structure in the early 1900s. After the original church burned down in 1905, the board of trustees selected a site on Lake Street and hired Wright to design a new building, Unity Temple. Wright&#x27;s plans were approved in 1906 after much debate, and construction began on May 15 of that year. After various delays, Unity House opened in September 1907, and the auditorium was finished in October 1908; the church was dedicated on September 26, 1909. Over the years, the temple attracted visitors from around the U.S. and worldwide. The church was restored in the 1960s, and it gradually underwent further upgrades from the 1970s to the 2000s. Unity Temple was completely refurbished from 2015 to 2017.

The temple is decorated with abstract motifs instead of overtly religious imagery. The facade is made of Portland cement, which has been washed away to expose the gravel underneath; there are recessed clerestory windows near the top. Unlike contemporary churches, Unity Temple was designed without a spire; instead, the roof consists of multiple flat, overhanging concrete slabs. The auditorium is shaped like a Greek cross, with stair towers at each corner. It has two levels of seating surrounding a central pulpit, in addition to clerestories and skylights. Unity House has skylights and two balconies.

Unity Temple has received extensive architectural commentary over the years, and it has been the subject of many media works, including books and museum exhibits. Its design is credited with having helped inspire multiple architects. Unity Temple is designated as a National Historic Landmark and is part of The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, a World Heritage Site.

==Early history==
Eleven members of the Union Church—a liberal Protestant congregation in Oak Park, a village in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois—met on January 25, 1871, to discuss the formation of a new congregation. E. W. Hoard hosted a meeting to raise money for a church building, collecting more than $5,000. Unity Church of Oak Park, a non-denominational church, was formed that March. The congregation acquired land at the southwest corner of Wisconsin Avenue (later Pleasant Street) and Marion Street, south of the Union Pacific West railroad line, from Milton C. Niles. The treasurer, Edwin O. Gale, provided $5,600, or nearly half of the $13,689 cost. It is unknown who designed the original church, which was built in the Gothic Revival style. The original church was a rectangle topped by a spire. Inside was a ground-level parish hall with an auditorium above it; a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article from 1872 described the church as having a stone foundation and wood frame. Within the auditorium was a raised pulpit and rows of seats bisected by a central aisle.

Work on the new church began in early 1871, and the basement was finished later that year. A consecration ceremony was held on August 11, 1872. In its early years, the congregation was composed of Universalists and Unitarians. As such, the church went through several pastors in its first decade. In 1882, some of the congregation&#x27;s Universalist members formed a sub-congregation affiliated with the Universalist Church of America; the congregation at large remained unaffiliated with any denomination. After going through six pastors in fifteen years, the church selected Augusta Jane Chapin as its pastor in 1886. During Chapin&#x27;s tenure, Anna Jones Wright, the mother of the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, joined the congregation.

Chapin left the congregation in December 1891, and Rodney Johonnot became the senior pastor the next year. During Johonnot&#x27;s first four years, the congregation grew to 225 members. A church organ was installed in 1897. The congregation had decided to build a new structure by March 1901, when members voted to establish a fund for the construction of a new temple. Johonott felt that the existing building could not accommodate all of the congregation&#x27;s activities. The congregation hired H. P. Harned to design a new structure on the existing site, south of the railroad tracks. By then, numerous churches were being built in Oak Park, and many of the newer churches were being built on Lake Street, north of the tracks. In December 1904, the board of trustees again asked the congregation for donations for a new temple. Following a meeting in May 1905, a committee was appointed to discuss plans for the new building.

== Temple development ==
The original Unity Church was destroyed on June 4, 1905, when a lightning strike started a blaze; firefighters were unable to extinguish the flames because of low water pressure. The fire caused about $20,000 in damage and destroyed everything except for the piano, chairs, paintings, dishes, and utensils. Within one week, the congregation had appointed four committees to oversee fundraising, site selection, design, and construction. In the meantime, the congregation temporarily met at Nakama Hall. The nearby First Baptist Church also hosted some of the congregation&#x27;s events.

=== Selection of site and architect ===

Initially, it was estimated that the new building would cost $50,000. The fundraising committee requested donations from various sources, while the site selection committee recommended that the new temple be built &quot;in some place more central&quot;. At the time, two-thirds of the congregation lived south of Lake Street, but congregants favored a site near that street; only one person preferred to keep the existing site. The committee considered several locations throughout the village. Two of these sites were located at Lake Street and Kenilworth Avenue: a private house on the southwestern corner, and a vacant lot owned by Gale on the southeastern corner. In early August 1905, the congregation paid Gale $10,000 or $11,000. The tract measured along Kenilworth Avenue and either or along Lake Street. The site complemented the nearby First Presbyterian and Grace Episcopal churches slightly to the west.

When the site was selected, the congregation had raised $30,000 toward the new building, and they began searching for an architect shortly afterward. On August 30, the planning committee met with nine architects, selecting four finalists: Frank Lloyd Wright, Dwight H. Perkins, William Augustus Otis, and Normand Smith Patton. At their September meeting, Unity Church&#x27;s board of trustees voted to allow the planning committee to select an architect. This person was to draw up plans for an edifice costing no more than $30,000.

Wright had been selected by mid-September. The engineer Charles E. Roberts, who led the church&#x27;s building committee, had influenced the church&#x27;s decision to select Wright. According to Wright, the board had considered hosting an architectural design competition (which he would have refused to join), but the historian Joseph Siry writes that there is no evidence that the board ever considered such a competition. &quot;Construction News&quot; reported that the temple would cost $35,000 and would be a one-story, brick-and-stone edifice. Though Wright may have considered using brick, this was never recorded in his plans. Wright instead proposed using concrete to save money, since, at the time, the church had only $45,000 on hand. The temple was the first public building that Wright designed by himself.

=== Design ===

==== Original plans ====
The trustees mandated that the new house of worship include a sanctuary for worship, a meeting room for secular events, and a classroom for the Sunday school. Furthermore, as Lake Street was a major street, Wright had to design a monumental building that would also fit the church&#x27;s budget. Many of the original drawings have been lost or destroyed, but Wright extensively documented his thought process in his autobiography. Wright wrote that Johonnot had wanted a &quot;Mission&quot;-style building, and he avoided traditional church architecture, instead proposing to the planning committee a &quot;temple to man ... in which to study man himself for his God&#x27;s sake&quot;. In the early plans, the temple&#x27;s northern wall was aligned with the house to the east (which was set back from Lake Street), and the north–south axis was aligned with the house to the south. Wright created physical drawings only after extensively refining the plans mentally. He also produced a plaster model of the temple, which he presented to the planning committee.

The entrance to the main sanctuary, known as the auditorium, was intentionally positioned away from the streetcar lines on Lake Street. Wright did not want to put the meeting room and Sunday school in the auditorium, as he felt that it would &quot;spoil the simplicity of the room&quot;. Accordingly, these rooms were instead placed in a separate church house called Unity House, which was linked to the auditorium by a central entrance hall. Having decided upon the site layout, Wright next designed the cube-shaped auditorium. Some preliminary drawings for the auditorium still exist. These include Scheme A, which called for 388 seats facing a pulpit on the south wall, and the rejected Scheme B, which called for 478 seats facing the north wall.

==== Design changes ====

In December 1905, the planning committee received Wright&#x27;s plans and recommended that the board of trustees approve them. The same month, Gale gave the congregation a strip of land on Kenilworth Avenue. By the beginning of 1906, the site of the original building had been sold for $6,500. The congregation decided to proceed with construction, even though it had received only one bid for the general contract, which exceeded the church&#x27;s budget by $8–10 thousand. Thomas Skillin, who led the board of trustees, reported that the temple was to cost $40,000 but that there was only $31,000 available. The trustees considered modifying the plans, splitting work into two phases, or borrowing money. Wright offered to reduce the cost to $35,000 by revising the plans and deferring installation of the furnishings.

Skillin objected that the auditorium was too small and dark. At its meeting on January 18, 1906, the board asked Skillin and Johonnot to discuss possible modifications with Wright. Subsequently, Wright revised the auditorium&#x27;s design, and he invited 75 members of the congregation to see the drawings and models for Unity Temple at his studio. The board approved Wright&#x27;s revisions on February 7, on the condition that no more than $36,200 be spent. Details of the design were reported in the local media on February 24, and a brochure describing the final plan was published on March 4. Wright&#x27;s assistant Charles E. White Jr. said the planning process had been marked by &quot;endless fighting&quot;. Wright continued refining the design details even after the final plans were accepted and (in some cases) partially completed. Despite initial objections to Wright&#x27;s design, Oak Park residents eventually came to like it.

=== Construction ===

==== Early construction ====
It took weeks to find a general contractor. Most of the bids that church officials did receive were significantly over budget, probably because of the unconventional nature of the concrete design, which drove many contractors away. Contractors found it difficult to decipher Wright&#x27;s plans, which did not resemble standard blueprints. Paul Mueller, who had previously built Wright&#x27;s E-Z Polish Factory and Larkin Administration Building, was ultimately selected as the contractor. Wright and Mueller began discussing the temple in January 1906, and Mueller was hired that April, having submitted a low bid of $32,221. The trustees agreed to pay Mueller $32,661 as long as Mueller paid a $15,000 bond, which would be refunded if the temple was completed on time. The board also approved a $1,243.23 builder&#x27;s fee for Wright. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 15, 1906. One of Wright&#x27;s draftsmen, Isabel Roberts, acted as a liaison to church officials, while Arthur Tobin coordinated the construction schedules.

The first part of the temple to be constructed was Unity House. Work on the foundation progressed slowly, and the building committee had to allocate another $645.60 for the foundations due to cost overruns. Mueller was also busy with other projects across the United States, which further delayed the temple&#x27;s construction. The contractors acquired large amounts of wood to create the formwork, into which the temple&#x27;s concrete slabs were to be poured. The wooden forms were constructed to uniform dimensions of , allowing them to be reused; each timber form was made of several 2-by-4 boards. Rectangular blocks of wood were used to cast the facade&#x27;s concrete columns, which had to be cast in multiple pieces because they were too large. The various pieces of each column were bound together using grout.

Wright contemplated embedding red granite or another material into the outer walls. Twenty samples of concrete, embedded with red granite or gravel, were presented to the board of trustees for review. Church officials decided not to use red granite due to the expense involved; instead, they agreed to apply an acidic solution to roughen the facade. The concrete walls were poured at a rate of no more than every 24 hours. The walls were constructed one by one, and the wooden forms had to be disassembled and rebuilt after each wall was completed, which caused further delays. In addition, concrete could not be poured during the wintertime. Foster &amp; Glidden Co. were hired in September 1906 to install the electrical, plumbing, and heating and ventilation systems. Although Mueller&#x27;s contract mandated that the temple be completed by November 1906, the exterior was not nearly finished at that time. This prompted Edwin Ehrman, the building committee&#x27;s leader, to complain to Mueller. Furthermore, Wright frequently modified the plans while construction was underway, then tried to force the trustees to pay for the increased costs, to which they refused. Mueller, who did not reject Wright&#x27;s changes, lost money as a result and eventually went bankrupt.

==== Delays and completion ====
The heating system was installed in February 1907. Amid increasing expenses and decreasing revenue, the congregation&#x27;s general fund had dwindled to $11.31 by March, and many former members had departed. &quot;Oak Leaves&quot; wrote that &quot;the finances were in good condition&quot;, despite a shortfall in the construction fund. By then, Wright wrote that Unity House would be finished in May and the auditorium in September. The eastern wall and parts of the auditorium&#x27;s stair towers had been completed by May, but the roofs had not been constructed. Church officials had resorted to borrowing money, despite a concerted attempt to obtain donations and other fees from the congregation. Unity House began hosting services on September 15, 1907, and the church&#x27;s Ladies Social Union purchased some furniture the same week. The auditorium&#x27;s roof had been completed, but the terraces and entrance pavilion were still under construction, and landscaping work was still ongoing. Congregants had to enter Unity House through the back door.

Wright and the contractors continued to fine-tune the building&#x27;s heating system, and the contractors submitted invoices for their work, which the congregation could not afford to pay. The project was paused in late 1907, and Ehrman requested that Wright provide a timetable for Unity Temple&#x27;s completion, which the architect did in January 1908. That February, Wright invited artists and musicians to attend a &quot;Symposium of Art&quot; at Unity House. Wright wrote to the congregation the next month, requesting that Mueller be paid $11,000. Congregants pledged $5,771 for the building&#x27;s completion at their annual meeting the same month, which allowed the trustees to finally reimburse Mueller. The plasterwork was completed in July 1908, after the board of trustees had threatened to fire Mueller over his failure to finish the plastering. The temple&#x27;s mechanical contractor Foster &amp; Glidden were completing the building&#x27;s electrical systems by August, and the pews were under construction by that September. All of the art glass had also been installed by then.

The auditorium&#x27;s opening, scheduled for October 11, 1908, was postponed due to delays in manufacturing the pews. The auditorium hosted its first service on October 25, 1908, though Wright did not attend. The building could not be formally dedicated because the organ had not been installed; church officials had received bids from a dozen organ manufacturers, many of whom were discouraged by Wright&#x27;s abstruse drawings. The church did not hire a manufacturer until September 1908, when officials paid Coburn &amp; Taylor $3,500 to install an organ in two months. The heating system was also ineffective, and the boiler burst shortly after the auditorium opened, forcing the congregation to vacate the auditorium until February 1909.

Construction issues notwithstanding, congregants quickly came to like the new temple. By 1909, the congregation&#x27;s membership consisted of more than 140 families. During that year, church officials largely resolved their remaining disputes with contractors, and the decorations inside were finished. Johonnot resigned that June, expressing frustration that he had received little encouragement from the congregation during his tenure. Church members refused to accept his resignation, as he was still popular among members of the congregation. Johonnot ultimately agreed to remain Unity Church&#x27;s pastor for one more year. The temple was officially dedicated on September 26, 1909, and the congregation published a brochure for the occasion. The temple had cost $60,344.55, and the congregation borrowed some $14,500 to pay for the cost overruns. Members pledged two-thirds, or nearly $32,200, of the remaining cost, though it would take several years before the construction cost was fully repaid.

== Temple usage ==

=== Early and mid-20th century ===

After Unity Temple opened, the building&#x27;s architecture attracted visitors from across the U.S. Johonnot ultimately resigned at the end of June 1910. The next pastor, S. G. Dunham, established a weekly &quot;social clinics class&quot; at the temple in late 1910; he served as the pastor until early 1913. William J. Taylor became Unity Temple&#x27;s pastor in November 1913 and began giving sermons there the next month. During Taylor&#x27;s tenure, the congregation paid back its remaining debt of $6,000, and a congregant, E. O. Gale, donated a parsonage. Taylor resigned in 1919 to become the pastor of First Universalist Church in Wausau, Wisconsin, and he was succeeded by James W. Vallentyne. The congregation celebrated the 50th anniversary of its founding with a weeklong party in early 1921. Vallentyne resigned as Unity Church&#x27;s pastor in 1924, though he remained in Oak Park for several months. D. T. Denman, who had served various congregations in Oak Park for two decades, merged his congregation with that of Unity Church in 1925, becoming the combined congregation&#x27;s pastor.

Denman served until 1932 and was replaced that year with Frank D. Adams. In 1935, the congregation of the Church of the Redeemer in Chicago also merged with Unity Church&#x27;s congregation. The congregation had 200 members by the mid-1940s, who met every Sunday from September to June; by then, the church was called the Unity Universalist Church. John Q. Parkhurst was elected as the church&#x27;s pastor in early 1945, just after Adams resigned. The next year, Unity House was lent to a local youth club, and its interior was redecorated to resemble a ship&#x27;s lounge; the club operated there for three months. At the time, the congregation&#x27;s membership included many of Oak Park&#x27;s longtime families, in addition to congregants from neighboring towns and villages. &quot;Oak Leaves&quot; reported that the building was depicted in a wide range of architectural publications and that it attracted visitors from around the world, though local residents largely ignored it.

Parkhurst left the congregation in 1952, and Robert M. Rice became the church&#x27;s new minister. By then, the congregation had 325 members who met every Sunday except in August, and the church&#x27;s youth fellowship met every other Sunday. The church was known simply as the Universalist Church by the late 1950s. The temple also hosted visiting architects, including Wright himself, as well as several groups of students each year. Rice left the building largely intact during his tenure, converting Unity House&#x27;s two balconies to classrooms and adding a chapel for children. In addition, in 1959, workers filled in cracks and covered up exposed rods, and they applied a stucco-like paste to the exterior.

=== Late 20th century ===

==== 1960s ====
By the 1960s, the concrete had begun to spall and leak; the congregation ruled out the idea of using stucco to patch the facade, and there were discussions about potentially demolishing the temple. Instead, Wright&#x27;s son-in-law William Wesley Peters, a principal in Taliesin Associated Architects, oversaw a restoration of the building, which was completed in 1961 for $22,000. Workers patched the cracks by sandblasting the concrete, placing a cement aggregate into the cracks, and applying another mixture to wear away the facade&#x27;s topmost layer. A sealant was then applied onto the facade, and the building was repainted in its original color scheme. The temple was rededicated in 1962. By then, the congregation had a religious school and a youth club, in addition to its typical Sunday services. The building still attracted international visitors, while the congregation had become known as the Unitarian Universalist Church.

John Michiels renovated the temple&#x27;s lower level in 1966 for $20,000, though these modifications did not follow Wright&#x27;s original design. The work involved refurbishing a bathroom and three classrooms. Church officials formed a committee in 1967 to raise funds for a further renovation of Unity Temple. That May, the congregation decided to open the temple for public tours five days a week to raise money for the renovations. It cost $1,000 to launch the tour program, which did not make a net profit until its second year. The skylights were subsequently replaced in 1968; since the tours had not raised sufficient funds, the women&#x27;s auxiliary at Unity Temple helped fund part of the project. The next year, the Edgar J. Kaufmann Foundation pledged $75,000 in matching funds toward the temple&#x27;s renovation after Edgar Kaufmann Jr., a former Wright acolyte, heard about the initiative. Bill Fyfe and Michiels jointly designed a restoration plan. According to Michiels, the wiring, doors, stairs, windows, and sidewalks needed repairs the most urgently. 

==== 1970s ====

By 1970, the church had raised $25,000 from tours, subscriptions, and donations. The restoration also received funds from the congregation itself, the National Park Service, four anonymous donors, and Alden B. Dow, in addition to tour revenue and insurance payments. After Rice retired in 1970, he was replaced by Gerald Krick the following March. In addition, a committee was formed to oversee the restoration, which was prioritized after a fire had damaged Unity House in January 1971. A local firm, Sturr-Young Associates, was hired to repaint the auditorium in its original colors, restore the skylights, and redecorate the interior, while Frank&#x27;s son Lloyd Wright was retained as a consultant. The congregation was unable to raise the funds for the temple&#x27;s upkeep by itself. As such, congregants directed the board of trustees to establish a foundation to oversee the temple&#x27;s restoration in December 1972. The Unity Temple Restoration Corporation was formed the next year as a secular entity, separate from the congregation. The restoration group raised $500 per month from small donors and tour revenue, and it received additional funding from large donors, the federal and local governments, and the congregation.

A restoration of the facade commenced in 1973 and ultimately cost $200,000. Workers removed the cladding that had been added in the 1960s, and they sprayed shotcrete, a type of concrete, onto the facade. The interior was also repainted and partially rewired, That year, the Kaufmann Foundation increased their grant to $250,000, at which point the church had raised $230,000. The temple could also receive federal restoration funds because it was on the National Register of Historic Places, so the Illinois Department of Conservation requested $114,850 for interior restoration in late 1973. The temple began hosting concerts later that year, and it launched a concert series that helped raise money for the renovation. To raise further money, the church sponsored field trips to Taliesin, Wright&#x27;s studio in Wisconsin. By 1975, church officials had spent more than $250,000 over the preceding eight years, but the project needed at least another $250,000. In addition, the Restoration Foundation had gone into debt.

The Restoration Foundation had nearly matched the Kaufmann grant by 1976, and it wanted to create a $500,000 financial endowment for Unity Temple&#x27;s continued upkeep. The Kaufmann Foundation offered a grant to establish the restoration fund in April 1978, provided the Restoration Foundation raise $50,000 in eight weeks. The next year, the Kaufmann Foundation offered another $50,000 matching grant. Work on the foyer&#x27;s renovation began in May 1979 and was nearly completed by the end of the year. The foyer was restored to its original appearance, and later modifications, such as ceiling tiles and shelves, were removed. The Restoration Foundation also planned to repair the leaky roof, a project that ultimately cost $85,000. A company from Washington, D.C., was hired to determine the original paint colors.

==== 1980s and 1990s ====
Charles Scot Giles became Unity Temple&#x27;s pastor in 1981 following a year-long search. The next year, the Restoration Foundation established a subcommittee to organize events at the temple. By then, the temple received 10,000 to 15,000 annual visitors, and the Restoration Foundation was planning to spend $500,000 on the interior. The auditorium was subsequently repainted gray, green-gray, yellow, and ivory, and magnesite carpets were added. This work was completed in 1984, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of the temple&#x27;s dedication. The temple received a $20,000 matching grant from Domino&#x27;s cofounder Thomas Monaghan in 1987, which was to be used restore the temple&#x27;s skylights. By then, the predicted cost of the renovation had increased to $750,000. In addition, the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois and the congregation signed an agreement to preserve the temple in January 1988. The council received a preservation easement that limited changes to the temple. The auditorium&#x27;s skylights were repaired that year, and a firm from Wisconsin restored the panels and replaced 40% of the glass.

Despite large donations from Kaufmann, Domino&#x27;s and Steelcase, officials at the Restoration Foundation reported decreasing revenue in the 1980s. Foundation officials commissioned a report in 1989, which found that the roof was in very poor condition; foundation officials estimated that the roof would cost $280,000 to repair. Though the foundation wanted to dismantle part of the roof for inspection, congregation members disputed the report&#x27;s findings and considered severing their relationship with the foundation. Ultimately, the congregation decided to continue working with the foundation, and it ordered additional inspections of the roof. During the 1990s, the temple continued to host tours for a fee, along with services every Sunday. Shirley Ann Ranck was named as Unity Temple&#x27;s interim minister in 1991, becoming the first woman to lead the congregation in a century. F. Jay Deacon became the permanent minister of the congregation in 1993, and the clerestory windows were repaired that year.

The congregation merged with the Beacon Unitarian Church in 1994, becoming the Unity Temple Unitarian Universalist Congregation. That year, the Restoration Foundation established a volunteer program to raise further money; it sought to raise $600,000 over seven years. The temple started hosting avant-garde music concerts in 1996 to raise more money. The Oak Park village government allocated $32,500 in 1999 for a study of the temple&#x27;s exterior. By then, $1.5 million had been spent on restoration. Simultaneously, the Restoration Foundation was raising $1.5 million in advance of the temple&#x27;s centennial. Unlike other state governments, Illinois did not provide historic-preservation loans at the time, although it subsequently began distributing such loans. State representative Angelo Saviano negotiated to secure state funding for Unity Temple after seeing the poor condition of the exterior.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2000s ====

Unity Temple still had serious mechanical and structural issues in the 21st century. The building had no air-conditioning system, leading to significant temperature fluctuations; the temperature sometimes reached during the summer. The temple&#x27;s roof sagged significantly, while the interiors were damaged by carbon-dioxide buildups and humidity. The art glass, which had cracked due to repeated freezing and thawing over the years, needed to be repaired. The concrete facade had become cracked and spalled, and condensation had built up within the walls, causing it to rain inside. There were also leaks from the drains inside the building. Workers began removing concrete samples from the facade in January 2000 in preparation for a wider-ranging renovation. After the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois labeled the building among Illinois&#x27;s most endangered structures that March, the state government gave Unity Temple $1 million for restoration.

By late 2000, workers were about to restore the concrete. This work was part of a larger, three-phase project which would cost up to $5 million. Holes were cut into the facade, and the underlying rebar was replaced. Fern C. Stanley was appointed as interim pastor in August 2002. After her death in May 2003, Alan Taylor became Unity Temple&#x27;s pastor the same year. At that point, there were 359 congregants, though Taylor helped double the congregation&#x27;s size during his 18-year tenure. The Landmarks Preservation Council provided $100,000 for a geothermal heating upgrade in 2004, which was part of the first phase of a $12–15 million renovation. The Restoration Foundation planned to patch the concrete and add a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. The third and final phase would entail restoration of the interior. Gunny Harboe, a restoration architect based in nearby Chicago, was hired to design a restoration of the temple. A test well for the heating system was installed in late 2005. The congregation continued to host tours, and it sold off furniture and furnishings to raise money.

By the mid-2000s, the temple attracted 25–30 thousand annual visitors, many of them from outside the U.S. Because parts of the temple were still being used as offices and classrooms, they could not be renovated until the congregation obtained additional space. Part of the ceiling collapsed around 2008; the water damage was attributed to the lack of expansion joints and a flat roof. A huge piece of the left wall had cracked open, and there were cracks in the facade and leaks throughout the building. Unity Temple received a $200,000 matching funds grant in December 2008 through the Save America&#x27;s Treasures program, contingent on the congregation raising an equivalent amount for the temple&#x27;s restoration. The next year, the National Trust for Historic Preservation added Unity Temple to its America&#x27;s Most Endangered Places list, and the temple received more than $82,000 for visitor services such as tours and brochures. By then, the renovation was scheduled to cost $20–25 million, and the Restoration Foundation hoped to raise more money for restoration if the building were designated as a World Heritage Site.

==== 2010s to present ====

Most of the letters from the sign above Unity Temple&#x27;s main entrance were stolen in 2010, shortly after the roof was replaced for $500,000. After the congregation raised $3,000 to replace the letters, a local preservation firm installed a new sign above the entrance. The Alphawood Foundation pledged $10 million toward the temple&#x27;s restoration in 2013. The congregation also considered transferring ownership of the temple to Alphawood so that organization could help maintain the building. By early 2015, the Restoration Foundation had about $11.5 million or $12.5 million on hand. Restorers drew up detailed plans to repaint the building, restore the original architectural features, and repair mechanical systems; the plans needed approval from three agencies before renovations could start.

A full restoration began in 2015, at which point the project was to cost $23 million or $25 million. The congregation relocated that June; services were hosted in the nearby United Lutheran Church, while church officials also used an administrative office on South Boulevard and another office nearby. The first phase of the project involved replacing the skylights, roof, and shotcrete facade. A second phase included the geothermal and HVAC system, new art glass, and new light fixtures. The windows were restored in California, and new electric wiring, glass, and wood finishes were added. The project was supposed to be completed in late 2016 but was postponed by several months because of restorers&#x27; focus on architectural details. The congregation bought the nearby Oak Park Billiards building at South Boulevard in 2016, which was also renovated.

Following a preview event in May 2017 to mark the renovation&#x27;s completion, the temple formally reopened on June 17, 2017, and tours resumed that July. About half of the construction cost had been raised at the time. After a developer proposed a 28-story tower nearby in 2018, the church&#x27;s board of trustees expressed concerns that the tower would cast shadows on the temple; the tower was eventually canceled. Alan Taylor resigned as Unity Temple&#x27;s senior minister in 2021. Roger Bertschausen became the senior minister in 2013, and the Unity Temple Restoration Foundation was dissolved that year.

==Building==

Unity Temple is located at 875 Lake Street in Oak Park, Illinois, United States. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Prairie style, the structure is T-shaped in plan, measuring or long from north to south. On the same city block to the east is Scoville Square. The Calvary Memorial Church is nearby to the west, across Kenilworth Avenue, while the Oak Park Public Library and Scoville Park are directly to the north, across Lake Street. In addition, the Oak Park station of the Chicago &quot;L&quot;&#x27;s Green Line is two blocks to the southeast.

Unity Temple is one of 24 or 25 buildings that Wright designed in Oak Park, as well as Wright&#x27;s only significant remaining Prairie-style structure that was designed as a public building. Wright used abstract motifs instead of overtly religious imagery, and he described the building as a &quot;temple&quot; because its simple motifs resembled those of old temples. Unity Temple is arranged around a grid of cubic &quot;units&quot; measuring on each side. The building is made of four types of concrete, which was poured in place and was used because of the material&#x27;s low cost. Concrete and crushed limestone are used in the foundation walls at the perimeter of the building, as well as underneath the columns. Interior and exterior walls are made of a concrete-and-gravel aggregate with embedded steel rods. The concrete was poured in place. The Temple Art Glass Company manufactured Unity Temple&#x27;s multicolored art glass panes, which are bound together by strips of zinc.

Several elements of the design are shared with the now-demolished Larkin Building, which was completed shortly before Unity Temple was. For example, both structures included two rectangular spaces linked by an entrance pavilion, a layout also used in Wright&#x27;s Oak Park studio. The Larkin Building and Unity Temple were both centered on a large communal room; in both structures, visitors had to make several turns to access the room, and there were balconies around the space itself. Other decorative elements, such as contrasting vertical and horizontal lines, were also visible in both structures. However, the two buildings also differed in key respects, such as their functions and shapes. Unity Temple also bears similarities to the Prairie style houses that Wright designed in Chicagoland; for instance, both Unity Temple and Wright&#x27;s Prairie-style houses have windows with geometric patterns.

=== Exterior ===
The temple is composed of two main structures—the auditorium to the north and Unity House to the south—connected by a low, central entrance hall. The arrangement allowed religious and secular activities to be kept separate. The exterior of the auditorium section is a square measuring across and high, while Unity House measures about across. The two-story entrance building measures across. The facade is recessed from the southern edge of the site, from the western and eastern edges, and from the northern edge.

==== Facade ====

The facade uses Portland cement. To give the facade some texture, the top layer of cement was washed away, exposing bits of gravel underneath. The wooden formwork created markings, which remained in place after the concrete had been poured. Joseph Siry described Unity Temple&#x27;s exterior as a predecessor to the &quot;béton brut&quot; (&quot;raw concrete&quot;) facades that became popular in the 1960s. There are stair towers at each corner of the auditorium building, which measure high and across. On each elevation of the facade, narrow slit windows separate the central portions of the facade from the staircase towers.

The base of the facade, directly above the foundation walls, is thicker than the rest of the facade and is decorated with square and rectangular moldings. Above the base, the facade takes two small steps inward. On each elevation of the facade, the central portions ascend without interruption to a protruding window sill, situated above ground. There is no entrance on Lake Street; instead, there is a low wall on Kenilworth Avenue, behind which a set of stairs ascends to the entrance pavilion. The words &quot;For the worship of God and the service of man&quot; are inscribed in bronze letters above the entrance pavilion&#x27;s doors. There are Japanese–inspired square lanterns on the exterior, next to the entrance. Next to the Kenilworth Avenue facade, there is a pier with colonnades and rectangular flower boxes.

The centers of all four elevations of the auditorium are decorated with clerestory windows, which are recessed and measure across. The clerestory windows have geometric patterns and are largely made of plain glass, except for white and green panes at the tops of the windows. Each set of clerestory windows is flanked by six exterior columns. Additionally, Unity House has four columns on two of its elevations. All of the columns were designed by Richard Bock and measure tall. The columns are spaced apart, aligning with the interior grid. The tops of the columns are decorated with hollyhock motifs. The lowest 7 feet of each column is unornamented and was cast in one piece, while the ornate upper sections were cast in four pieces. The bases of the columns are stepped inward, while the capitals are stepped outward, supporting the cantilevered roofs above. The juxtaposition of the columns, and the roofs above them, may have been an allusion to older classical-style and religious buildings with pillars. The facade is topped by square and rectangular copings. In the 2010s, lighting was installed on the ground outside the building.

==== Roofs ====
Unlike contemporary churches, Unity Temple was designed without a spire, nor did it include typical church features such as a tower or an arched roof. At the time of construction, church spires were increasingly outdated and were vulnerable to lightning strikes. The temple is instead topped by 14, 16, or 17 flat roofs. These are made of cinder concrete, topped with lightweight cinder-concrete tiles. Each roof is composed of slabs measuring wide. The auditorium roof&#x27;s eaves extend outward from the facade&#x27;s columns, overhanging the adjacent lawns and paths. The writer Neil Levine wrote that the cantilevered roofs created the impression that the interiors were being directed outward. The edges of each roof are twice as thick as the rest of the roof, creating a low parapet wall, while the eaves contrast with the facade&#x27;s thick base.

=== Interior ===

Wright described Unity Temple&#x27;s interior as reflecting &quot;the reality of the building—the space in which we live and not the walls and the roof&quot;. The foundations and columns are made of conventional concrete; the floor slabs are made of cinder concrete, in which coal cinders are embedded into the cement. The superstructure also uses steel beams, which are entirely covered with concrete. The interior was more colorful than the gray exterior, in part because of the windows. The walls are made of plaster, which is covered with an aggregate of sand, cement, and putty; a sealant was added to this aggregate, and the sealant was painted. The interiors are also decorated with wooden boards, which not only articulate (or stylize) the interiors, but also conceal electrical wires. Joseph Siry described the decorations as &quot;a poetic invention that sprang from Wright&#x27;s own imagination&quot;, while Neil Levine wrote that the decorations highlighted &quot;space and depth, rather than mass and volume&quot;. Wright also included high ceilings &#x27;for the contemplation for the soul&quot;, as &quot;Oak Leaves&quot; described it.
==== Entrance pavilion ====
An entrance pavilion, measuring across, connects the auditorium and Unity House. On the first floor, there is a foyer with a low ceiling. an example of the compression-and-release principle that Wright espoused. The foyer measures about wide and adjoins a cloak room and a bathroom. To the north, visitors make two 90-degree turns before reaching the auditorium&#x27;s perimeter, as Wright wanted visitors to go on a &quot;path of discovery&quot; to reach the auditorium. The north wall of the foyer is decorated with wooden slats and was initially designed as a hidden exit from the auditorium, without any doorknobs or visible hinges.

The foyer&#x27;s west and east walls each contain a bank of six doors measuring wide, with art-glass panes; the west doors form the main entrance. The south wall has a glass partition, behind which Unity House&#x27;s fireplace can be seen. A pastor&#x27;s study is located within the second floor of the pavilion and is directly connected to both the auditorium and Unity House.

==== Auditorium ====

===== Layout =====

Wright wrote that he had &quot;let the room inside be the architecture outside&quot; by designing the rest of the temple around the auditorium. The auditorium at the north end of the temple has either 380 or 400 seats. It is shaped like a Greek cross, with a freestanding pier at each corner. This contrasted with other churches in Oak Park, which had naves that were significantly longer than their width. Wright wanted congregants to circulate around the auditorium&#x27;s perimeter, rather than entering it from a central aisle, and he wanted the piers to draw visitors&#x27; attention inward. The piers are connected by &quot;cloisters&quot;, hallways beneath the auditorium&#x27;s main floor. According to Wright, this preserved the auditorium&#x27;s &quot;quiet and dignity&quot; by allowing people to circulate around the room unnoticed. The bases of the piers contain small anterooms, and staircases ascend to the main floor and balcony level. The piers also include pipes and ducts for heating and ventilation. The piers are decorated with wooden strips that meet at right angles.

At the center of the cross is a square measuring on each side, with a pulpit at the center. The pulpit is arranged so it is no farther than or from any seat. In front of the pulpit is a railing with wooden boards across its surface and a wooden coping at its top. The center of the railing, in front of the pulpit&#x27;s lectern, is slightly raised. There is a bench behind the railing, as well as lamps to either side. The southern wall contains a choir loft directly above the auditorium&#x27;s entrance, which extends to the balcony level. The choir screen consists of a series of vertical slits and interlocking geometric planes. The screen protrudes from the south wall, providing space for the organ pipes behind them. There is a door to the pastor&#x27;s study behind the choir screen.The pews in the auditorium are variants of a mass-produced model of pews manufactured by the American Seating Company. On three sides of the main floor are raised pews, which seat 54 people each; they are raked, sloping down toward the pulpit. The layout also allows audience members to face each other. Exits from either side of the pulpit lead directly to the entrance pavilion. This eliminated the need for congregants to turn away from the pulpit to leave, as was customary in older churches, and it allowed congregants to mingle with the pastor or other speakers at the pulpit. According to architectural critic Blair Kamin, the layout makes it so that &quot;one enters as an individual and leaves as a member of a community&quot;. The exit doors are normally closed during services. Since 2017, there has been a video screen behind the pulpit.

The balcony is about or two units above the ground and also surrounds the auditorium on three sides. The balcony has 153 seats in total, which are more steeply raked than those on the main level. The balcony is illuminated by spherical lamps, and there are wooden bands on the balcony&#x27;s railings and on the soffit along the balcony&#x27;s underside. The architectural historian Robert Twombly wrote that the balconies gave the auditorium an intimate feel while allowing visitors to feel like they were part of a larger &quot;majestic whole&quot;.

===== Decorations =====
The decorations in the auditorium, such as the windows and chandeliers, are generally designed with cruciform motifs, recalling its overall shape. Generally, the lower part of the room is painted in darker shades of yellow and green, while the upper part is painted in lighter shades. The baseboards and the piers&#x27; pedestals were left unpainted, since Wright anticipated that this would give the room a more somber ambiance. Natural light is provided through ceiling skylights and clerestories, as well as the narrow slit windows. According to Wright, the windows were intended &quot;to get a sense of a happy cloudless day into the room&quot;. Other than the slit windows and the door to the foyer, the lower part of the auditorium has no openings. Wright had designed planters or urns for the auditorium, but church officials refused to accept them. The auditorium also has several hardwood chairs, built in 2003 to replace the original Wright–designed chairs.

The auditorium&#x27;s ceiling is high. The center of the ceiling is topped by amber skylights, which are surrounded by bands of wood. The roof is supported by solid concrete beams oriented east–west, while the north–south beams are of hollow concrete. Inset within this grid of beams are 25 square skylight panels. Each panel measures across, with 83 pieces of glass, and is decorated with a fork-shaped motif pointing in one of the four cardinal directions. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article likened the skylights&#x27; designs to Piet Mondrian&#x27;s artwork. The space is also illuminated by overhanging spherical chandeliers flanked by cubic lamps, and the perimeter of the ceiling is made of oak boards.

==== Unity House ====

The interior of Unity House is painted in various shades of green, yellow, and brown. Unity House&#x27;s primary interior space measures about across, corresponding to approximately 12 by 4 units. There is a square hall at the center, measuring about or on each side. There are balconies to the west and east of the central hall, on the same story as the auditorium&#x27;s lower seating level. The balconies are supported by I-beams and contain small columns with wooden sconces, in addition to railings with wood strips. The columns have vertical wood strips along their shafts and horizontal wood strips at their capitals. The spaces under each balcony are illuminated by spherical lamps. The balconies and the spaces beneath them were originally used as classrooms.

There are square closets at each corner of Unity House&#x27;s main room, measuring about 1 unit wide. On the southern wall of the central hall is a recess with a fireplace measuring about wide; this feature recalled many of Wright&#x27;s residential designs, which also had central fireplaces. On the northern wall, there are three casement windows facing the pastor&#x27;s study.

Unity House primarily receives natural light from skylights in the ceiling. The roof trusses are supported by eight columns arranged in a 2×4 grid. The ceiling is divided into rectangular coffers measuring across. Each coffer has a skylight with four glass panes, which are either opaque or tinted in various shades of yellow, green, and brown. There are seven skylights in total, all of which are surrounded by wood strips. Rectangular and square motifs, reminiscent of the floor plans, are used in the skylights.

=== Mechanical features ===
Unity Temple originally had a coal-fired steam boiler, in addition to concrete ducts that were supposed to distribute heat. The ducts proved ineffective at carrying air, and as such, steam radiators were installed shortly after the temple was finished. A hot-water system was also installed within half a year of the temple&#x27;s completion; it remained in use through the 21st century. The coal-fired boiler was replaced with an oil-fired boiler in the early 20th century, and a gas generator was added later in the century. Since the 2010s, the church has been heated by a geothermal heating system, which consists of nine wells on the lawn just north of the church. This system includes ice-storage space and a set of geothermal wells.

== Clergy, services, and programs ==

=== Clergy ===
, Roger Bertschausen is the senior minister at Unity Temple, having joined as a &quot;developmental minister&quot; in 2023. The associate minister is Emily Gage, who joined as the minister of faith development in 2008. The church hosts services every Sunday at 9:00 a.m. and 10:45 a.m. In addition, it hosted an annual meeting every May. Senior pastors and senior ministers over the years have included:


=== Events and tours ===
Over the years, Unity Temple has been included in tours of Wright&#x27;s Oak Park buildings, such as tours provided by the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio Foundation (later the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust). Unity Temple is also part of the annual &quot;Wright Plus&quot; walking tour, which includes visits to several buildings designed by Wright. By 2017, the Frank Lloyd Wright Trust hosted tours of Unity Temple six days a week, in addition to more detailed tours once a week. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual tours of the temple were also hosted. Since 2018, Unity Temple has been part of the Frank Lloyd Wright Trail, a collection of 13 buildings designed by Wright in Illinois.

The church began hosting concerts in late 1973. Musicians frequently requested permission to perform there, prompting the church to launch a regular concert series in 1974. The series, which included music from a variety of genres, raised over $50,000 for the temple in its first quarter-century. The temple also hosted theatrical, ballet, and opera performances. In addition, in 1996, the church started hosting avant-garde music performances as part of its Creative and Improvised Music program, which was hosted there for two years.

Over the years, Unity Temple has hosted meetings for the local community, such as meetings for other Universalist congregations, conventions of the National Young People&#x27;s Christian Union, and dinners. The church hosted a program called &quot;Ways of Mankind&quot; during 1954, in which members of the public were invited to listen to, and discuss, radio broadcasts about selected topics. The church has also invited guest speakers, such as in 1964 when four liberal pastors gave speeches there. Other programs at the church have included &quot;Constructive Kids&quot;, an architectural program for primary-school children. Over the years, Unity Temple has hosted public exhibits, such as a 1963 exhibit about Wright&#x27;s architecture and a 1978 exhibit of Wright&#x27;s architectural drawings.

== Impact ==
When Unity Temple was completed, it differed significantly from other local churches&#x27; designs. Wright considered Unity Temple to be his first completed concrete-building design, and it was reportedly the first major reinforced-concrete building constructed in the U.S. The temple is also an early example of a building with an exposed-concrete facade, contrasting with earlier concrete structures in Europe, whose surfaces were typically concealed behind cladding. Paul Gapp of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote retrospectively that Wright&#x27;s use of concrete was &quot;a daring risk at the time&quot;.

Unity Temple has been cited as an early example of modern architecture, with Wright citing it as his first modern-style building. The Oak Park &quot;Wednesday Journal&quot; wrote in 2017 that Unity Temple was &quot;considered by many to be the world&#x27;s first &#x27;modern&#x27; building&quot;. According to Wright&#x27;s wife Olgivanna, after the temple was finished, foreign architects copied elements of its design. Unity Temple&#x27;s design has been credited with having helped inspire the European architects Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Peter Behrens. In addition, Unity Temple has inspired the design of structures such as the Maisonneuve Fire Station in Montreal, the Emerson Unitarian Church in Houston, and the Kunstmuseum Den Haag building in The Hague. The emphasis of materials and light in Unity Temple&#x27;s design helped inspire later buildings such as Notre-Dame du Haut and the First Unitarian Church of Rochester.

=== Reception ===

Upon the temple&#x27;s completion, images of the auditorium were published in &quot;Inland Architect and News Record&quot; magazine. Local newspaper &quot;Oak Leaves&quot; called it &quot;the most radical departure in traditional church architecture ever attempted&quot;, and the same newspaper said the &quot;severe simplicity of the exterior of the building [...] gives one little hint of the beauty of the interior&quot;. A writer for the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; said Unity Temple&#x27;s modern design represented &quot;the present, the twentieth century, the modern spirit, thought, faith, the modern freedom, the modern ideal&quot;. &quot;Architectural Record&quot; praised the acoustics as &quot;not sonorous and [...] only slightly reverberant&quot;. Conversely, Winthrop Kendall regarded the building as unattractive, &quot;without a vine or a tree to relieve its massive monotony&quot;, and disappointed congregants likened the temple to a Mayan handball court.

In 1928, a writer for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; described Unity Temple as one of a few buildings that expressed Wright&#x27;s &quot;idea of the thing—made to sing to heaven&quot;, while the &quot;Wausau Daily Herald&quot; said the design &quot;gave rise to the cubical monolith&quot;. A writer for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, in 1939, described Unity Temple as one of Wright&#x27;s &quot;pedigree buildings&quot;. A &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; article in 1961 said Unity Temple still &quot;looks quite fresh and contemporary today&quot;, and &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; likened the building to a &quot;visiting spaceship&quot; in 1981, and architectural historian Vincent Scully called it &quot;small, yet large&quot; and one of the nation&#x27;s most beautiful buildings. After the auditorium&#x27;s interior restoration was completed in the 1980s, a &quot;Boston Globe&quot; editor said the auditorium was &quot;almost as shocking as the restoration of the Sistine Chapel&quot;. The architectural critic Paul Goldberger perceived Unity Temple as representing &quot;a kind of symbolic gathering and communal presence, monumental dignity in a public place&quot;, calling it one of &quot;the greatest religious structures&quot; of the 20th century.

A writer for &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; in 1996 contrasted Unity Temple&#x27;s &quot;blocky&quot; massing with the low-roofed design of Robie House on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. David M. Sokol, in his 2008 book &quot;The Noble Room&quot;, wrote that the temple&#x27;s &quot;majesty and importance&quot; was partially derived from the fact that it was not arranged as typical church buildings had been. A writer for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the building may have been one of Wright&#x27;s favorite designs because it was &quot;imposing yet elegant&quot;. After the temple&#x27;s renovation was finished in 2017, a &quot;Curbed&quot; writer said the building&#x27;s imposing concrete facade &quot;belies what&#x27;s inside&quot;, while a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writer called the auditorium &quot;magnificent sanctuary noted for its high skylights of amber-tinted leaded glass&quot;. Blair Kamin wrote for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2025 that the temple&#x27;s exterior was &quot;monolithic, not monotonous&quot; because of its use of textured concrete and geometric motifs, while &quot;the sanctuary is as serene as architecture gets&quot;.

Unity Temple has also received architectural accolades. In 1959, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) deemed Unity Temple as one of 17 buildings designed by Wright that merited the highest levels of architectural preservation. A 1991 poll in &quot;Architectural Record&quot; magazine ranked Unity Temple as one of the 10 most significant buildings in the United States from the previous century. The temple&#x27;s 2017 restoration received several awards, including the American Institute of Architects&#x27; Crombie Taylor Award, the World Monuments Fund&#x27;s Modernism Prize, the Urban Land Institute&#x27;s Vision Award, and the Richard H. Driehaus Foundation&#x27;s Preservation Award. 

=== Media ===

Wright&#x27;s building has been the subject of several books. Unity Temple was detailed in Ernst Wasmuth&#x27;s 1910 &quot;Wasmuth Portfolio&quot;. The historian Joseph Siry wrote a book about the church&#x27;s architecture in 1996, while Robert McCarter published another book the following year with photographs of the temple. Patrick F. Cannon published a book about the temple through the Unity Temple Restoration Foundation in 2009, which received an accolade from the Independent Publisher Book Awards in 2023.

The Library of Congress acquired photographs and documents about Unity Temple in 1967. Additionally, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York displayed images of the temple in 1965 and 1988. Local photographer Redd Griffin created a slideshow with images of Unity Temple in the 1970s, and drawings of the temple have also been displayed at the Phoenix Art Museum in Arizona and at the Oak Park Library. The temple was detailed in the Scottish filmmaker Murray Grigor &#x27;s 1982 documentary about Wright&#x27;s Oak Park buildings. In addition, the 2020 documentary &quot;Unity Temple: Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Modern Masterpiece&quot;, produced by Lauren Levine and narrated by Brad Pitt, details the temple&#x27;s renovation.

=== Landmark designations ===
Unity Temple was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in April 1970; such a designation allowed properties to receive federal funds for restoration. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 30, 1970, and was re-added to the NRHP at that time. A plaque commemorating the National Historic Landmark designation was installed in June 1971. Oak Park officials considered including Unity Temple as part of a municipal historic district in 1971. When the district was created the next year, however, it excluded the temple.

The United States Department of the Interior nominated Unity Temple and nine other Wright–designed buildings to the World Heritage List in 2015; the buildings had previously been nominated in 2008. UNESCO added eight properties, including Unity Temple, to the World Heritage List in July 2019 under the title &quot;The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;.

<doc id="1247066" wikidata="Q162898" url="?curid=1247066" title="Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)">
<text>Mendelssohn&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 in G minor, Op. 25, was written in 1830–31, around the same time as his fourth symphony, and premiered in Munich on 17 October 1831. This concerto was composed in Rome during a travel in Italy after the composer met the pianist Delphine von Schauroth in Munich. The concerto was dedicated to her. Mendelssohn attended one party after another in Munich in October 1831, the month of the premiere, but he also played chamber music and taught double counterpoint. He performed the piece himself at the premiere, which also included performances of his &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot; and the Overture from &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. He had already written a piano concerto in A minor with string accompaniment (1822) and two concertos with two pianos (1823–24).

== Structure ==
The three connected movements use several relatively new formal techniques in their brief span — for example, the piano enters very soon after the opening of the first movement, with little of an orchestral &quot;tutti&quot; to contrast with. The concerto quickly obtained popularity, and contains many sections of improvisation, one of Mendelssohn&#x27;s specialities; it is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings.

===Molto allegro con fuoco===
The piano enters after only a few bars of orchestral introduction. It was standard procedure in the classical-era concerto to precede the solo&#x27;s entrance by a tutti, for various reasons – the length and purpose of these introductions differed, some offering a hint of what was to follow and some giving out almost all the movement&#x27;s material, but none was so brief as this: in this sense, this was one of the first concertos of the Romantic age. (The obvious exceptions – Mozart&#x27;s ninth and Beethoven&#x27;s fourth and fifth piano concertos – allowed the piano to enter very briefly just at the start, but then proceeded as usual, the soloist silent.)

The rest of the movement is fairly typical of concertos in its use of a modified sonata form, with a second, contrasting lyrical theme first heard from the piano over repeated accompaniment, and later on wind. As the movement closes a transition takes the movement not to a full close, but instead, with a brass fanfare and a piano continuation of the same, to the border of the Andante.

===Andante===
This opens with a melody in the lower strings, in E major, soon taken up by the piano. This is drawn out with breadth, and a middle section in B provides contrast. The original melody, somewhat varied, returns to close the movement.

===Presto—Molto allegro e vivace===
This opens with a fanfare in A minor (Presto). The piano joins in, at which point the mood lightens, and the closing rondo - Molto allegro e vivace - begins. This is regular in form, and the returns of the refrain are varied. Several themes from the first movement return towards the finale.

==Reception==
Though Mendelssohn said of the concerto &quot;I wrote it in but a few days and almost carelessly&quot;, the concerto was extremely popular—partially due to the efforts of Clara Schumann and Franz Liszt. Hector Berlioz described what happened to an Érard piano on which the concerto was too often played:
...the piano, which is out of its mind, has no intention of paying him any heed either. He sends for holy water and sprinkles the keyboard with it, but in vain—proof that it wasn&#x27;t witchcraft but merely the natural result of thirty performances of one concerto. They take the keyboard out of the instrument—the keys are still moving up and down by themselves—and they throw it into the middle of the courtyard next to the warehouse. There M. Erard, now in a fury, has it chopped up with an axe. You think that did it? it made matters worse. Each piece danced, jumped, frisked about separately—on the pavement, between our legs, against the wall, in all directions, until the warehouse locksmith picked up this bedeviled mechanism in one armful and flung it in the fire of his forge, finally putting an end of it...Such a fine instrument!

<text>NGC 3109 is a small barred Magellanic type spiral or irregular galaxy around 4.35 Mly away in the direction of the constellation of Hydra. NGC 3109 is believed to be tidally interacting with the dwarf elliptical galaxy Antlia Dwarf. It was discovered by John Herschel on March 24, 1835 while he was in what is now South Africa.

==Size and morphology==

NGC 3109 is classified as a Magellanic type irregular galaxy, but it may in fact be a small spiral galaxy. Based on the &quot;D&quot;25.5 isophote at the B-band with an angular diameter of arcseconds, it has an isophotal diameter approximately across, slightly larger than the Large Magellanic Cloud but smaller than the Triangulum Galaxy. If it is a spiral galaxy, it would be the smallest in the Local Group. NGC 3109 has a mass of about times the mass of the Sun (), of which 20% is in the form of neutral hydrogen. It is oriented edge-on from our point of view, and may contain a disk and a halo. The disk appears to be composed of stars of all ages, whereas the halo contains only very old and metal-poor stars. NGC 3109 does not appear to possess a galactic nucleus.

From measurements of the neutral atomic hydrogen in the galaxy, it has been found that the disk of NGC 3109 is warped. The warp has the same radial velocity as gas in the Antlia Dwarf galaxy, indicating that the two galaxies had a close encounter approximately one billion years ago.

==Composition==

Based on spectroscopy of blue supergiants in NGC 3109, it is known that the galaxy has a low metallicity, similar to that to the Small Magellanic Cloud. It is one of the most metal-poor star-forming galaxies in the Local group.
NGC 3109 seems to contain an unusually large number of planetary nebulae for its luminosity. It also contains a substantial amount of dark matter.

==Location==

NGC 3109 is located about away, in the constellation Hydra. This puts it at the very outskirts of the Local Group. Its membership of the Local Group has been questioned, because it seems to be receding faster than estimates of the Local Group&#x27;s escape velocity. It is distant enough from the largest members of the Local Group that it has not been tidally influenced by them.

==Luminous Blue Variable==
Although no supernovae have been observed in NGC 3109 yet, a luminous blue variable, designated AT2018akx (type LBV, mag. 17.5), was discovered by the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae on 22 March 2018.

<text>Blisworth Tunnel is a canal tunnel on the Grand Union Canal in Northamptonshire, England, between the villages of Stoke Bruerne at the southern end and Blisworth at the northern end.

==Measurements==
The northern end is about from the northern end of the Grand Junction Canal at Braunston, Northamptonshire and the southern end about .
At 3,076 yards (2,813m) long it is the third-longest navigable canal tunnel on the UK canal network after Standedge Tunnel and Dudley Tunnel (and the ninth-longest canal tunnel in the world). At its deepest point it is &quot;&quot;143 feet (&quot;ca.&quot;43m) below ground level.

The tunnel has no tow path inside, but is wide enough for two narrowboats to pass in opposite directions.

==History==
Work began in 1793, but errors by the contractor left a wiggle in the tunnel, and after three years’ work it collapsed due to quicksand, claiming the lives of 14 men. It was then decided to begin again with a new tunnel.

By the time the rest of the Grand Junction Canal had opened between London and Braunston, Northamptonshire in 1800, apart from the crossing of the River Great Ouse, the section of canal from Blisworth to the lower end of Stoke Bruerne locks was the only section unfinished. This was despite the tunnel having been under construction for seven years: the gap was filled by a temporary horse-drawn tramway over the top of the hill, with goods being transported from boat to wagon and back again. The tramway, built in 1801, was Northamptonshire&#x27;s first railway. In March 1805, the tunnel was finally opened and the rails were used to connect the main line of the canal to the River Nene until the branch canal to Northampton was constructed.

Until the 1870s travel through the tunnel was only achieved by men lying on their backs pushing the boats with their feet (legging). From 1871 steam tugs were used to pull boats through, and extra ventilation shafts were installed. Boaters wishing to avoid the extra cost involved in using the tugs could still leg their boats through, but by the 1930s motor boats (towing a butty boat) were common so the practice would have been unusual especially by the time the film &quot;Painted Boats&quot; was filmed there in 1944.

Due to changes in the shape of the tunnel over time, the tunnel became unnavigable. There was major rebuilding of the tunnel in the 1980s, with sections lined with pre-cast concrete rings. It was also used to test out the materials that were later used on the Channel Tunnel. An unused ring is on display near the south portal.

<text>The Netherlands–South African Railway Company (; ) or NZASM (also sometimes called SASM in South Africa) was a railway company established in 1887. The company was based in Amsterdam and Pretoria, and operated in the South African Republic (ZAR) during the late 19th century. At the request of ZAR president Paul Kruger, the NZASM constructed a railway line between Pretoria and Lourenço Marques in Portuguese East Africa (now Maputo in Mozambique).

==Background==
The British conquered the then Dutch Cape Colony in 1806. The new administration was not universally accepted by the Dutch colonists and after the 1830s thousands of Dutch-speaking colonists (called Boers) migrated to the interior of Southern Africa. This migration, known as the Great Trek, resulted in the establishment of 14 independent republics. By the mid 19th century these republics had merged into the two larger republics: The South African Republic (ZAR) and the Republic of the Orange Free State. The British Empire eventually recognized the independence of these republics in 1852 and 1854.

The relationship between the British and the Boers remained strained throughout the 19th century, especially as a result of the First Boer War (1880–81). Both republics were located in the interior of what is now South Africa, with no route to the coast that did not pass through the British-held Cape Colony and Colony of Natal. Paul Kruger, president of the ZAR, decided that an alternative trade route to the ocean was a priority for the ZAR. The Witwatersrand Gold Rush after 1886 resulted in the rapid industrialization of the ZAR, making access to the ocean even more important, and allowed the suddenly cash-flush republic to invest in large-scale infrastructure projects.
==Establishment==
In 1874 the &quot;Volksraad&quot; of the ZAR decided that a railway would be built connecting the ZAR with Lourenço Marques on Delagoa Bay in Portuguese East Africa (now Maputo in Mozambique). A commission was established in 1874 to create a plan for the construction of this railway. After initial success in raising capital and acquiring a railway concession from the Portuguese government, the project was stalled by the outbreak of the First Boer War. After the end of the war in 1881 the project was resumed, this time with renewed enthusiasm due to the threat of British domination over the Boer Republics. In 1884 a concession was granted to a group of Dutch investors, and this was followed by the official establishment of the Netherlands–South African Railway Company on 21 June 1887 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, funded by Dutch, German, and Boer investors.

The Pretoria - Delagoa Bay line, with a length of 562 kilometres (ca. 350 miles), was opened on 6 November 1894 and is still in use today. The railway company employed about 3000 people. Of these, about 1500 were employed in the construction of the Pretoria - Delagoa Bay Line. It adopted the (Cape Gauge) of the neighbouring Cape Government Railways.

On 19 February 1896, a train loaded with dynamite was struck by a shunter while being unloaded. The resulting Braamfontein Explosion was one of the largest artificial non-nuclear explosions in history, resulting in more than 70 deaths and 200 injuries.
In 1897, a new station was constructed in Johannesburg. The building was constructed in 1895 in Rotterdam and was used in the Amsterdam Exhibition before being dismantled and shipped to Johannesburg, where it was rebuilt in 1897. Although Johannesburg Park Station has twice been reconstructed, the 1897 building was preserved and moved a short distance to Newtown where it still stands, unused, today.

By 1899, the NZASM had constructed 1147 kilometres (ca. 712 miles) of railway.

==The Randtram Line==
As a result of the rapid development of the goldfields on the Witwatersrand in the 1880s and the demand for coal by the growing industry, on 20 July 1888 the ZAR government granted a concession to the NZASM to construct a railway line from Johannesburg to Boksburg. The line was opened on 17 March 1890, with the first train being hauled by a 14 Tonner locomotive. It became known as the &quot;Randtram&quot;, even though it was actually a railway in every aspect and not singularly dedicated to tram traffic. This was the first working railway line in the Transvaal.

The concession was extended the following year to continue the line eastward to Springs, where coal was known to exist, and westward via Roodepoort to Krugersdorp. The entire line was opened to traffic on 10 February 1891.

In 1889 and 1890, the NZASM obtained three tramway steam locomotives with an wheel arrangement for use on the Randtram line. Since the railway classified its locomotives according to their weight, these tank locomotives were known as the 10 Tonners. As the Randtram line was expanded to the west and east to become the Reef line between Roodepoort and Springs, the 14 Tonners remained in service on that line, even though their range of operation was somewhat limited by their small coal and water carrying capacities. The first locomotive, No. 1, named &quot;Transvaal&quot;, entered service on 18 July 1889. It hauled the first train on the Randtram line when it was opened on 17 March 1890, and was retired in December 1903, by which time it had covered a distance of .

By 1899 the Randtram Line had expanded to a length of 82 kilometres (ca. 51 miles).

==Pretoria–Delagoa Bay Line (&quot;Oosterlijn&quot;)==

In order to have an outlet to a harbour, a railway line from Delagoa Bay in Portuguese East Africa to Pretoria had been proposed to the &quot;Volksraad&quot; of the ZAR by President F.T. Burgers as far back as 1872. The Portuguese supported the idea, since it would open a trade route from Portuguese East Africa into the interior. In 1883, Major Joachim Machado was sent to the Transvaal to report on a proposed route through the Komati River and Crocodile River valleys towards the Highveld and Pretoria. The resulting agreement was for the Portuguese to construct the section from Delagoa Bay to the border at Komatipoort, while the ZAR would be responsible for the continuation of the line to Pretoria.

The Portuguese line from Delagoa Bay had already reached the border on 14 December 1887, but the first train from Delagoa Bay only entered Komatipoort on 1 July 1891, when the NZASM&#x27;s contractors completed the bridge across the Komati River. The line from Komatipoort to Nelspruit was completed by 20 June 1892. Waterval Boven was reached on 20 June 1894 and Balmoral, near Witbank, on 20 October 1894, connecting with the line which had simultaneously been built eastwards from Pretoria.

The construction of the railway line from Delagoa Bay to Pretoria was beset with difficulties, both in terms of disease and engineering. Malaria claimed many lives among the construction crews, and some of the terrain was mountainous. In the Elandspruit Valley, where the river formed a waterfall, the adjacent cliffs presented a natural barrier to the continuation of the railway from the Eastern Transvaal Lowveld up to the Transvaal Highveld.

In terms of construction, the climb up the escarpment was arguably the most difficult section to be encountered by the railway builders on the route. When the line reached Waterval Onder, they had a choice between a lengthy detour with sharp curves and costly deep cuttings, embankments and viaducts, to comply with the agreed upon gradient of 1 in 50 (2%), or a shorter section, which would entail a gradient of 1 in 20 (5%) over a distance of in one place, as well as a tunnel.

The shorter and steeper route was selected. While a gradient of 1 in 20 (5%) is not insurmountable by light trains with orthodox adhesion locomotives, safety and economical considerations led to the decision to install a rack track on the section up the escarpment between Waterval Onder and Waterval Boven. The rack track was built to the Riggenbach system which was in use on European mountain railways, with the rack laid between the rails.

The line, also known as the &quot;Oosterlijn&quot; (East Line) from Pretoria to Lourenço Marques had a total length of 562 kilometres (ca. 350 miles), of which 472 kilometres (ca. 293 miles) formed part of the &quot;Oosterlijn.&quot; The full line followed the following route:*
* Pretoria (start)
* Bronkhorstspruit
* East Rand
* Middelburg
* Waterval Boven
* Nelspruit
* Komatipoort (last stop in South Africa)

&quot;Border crossing between South Africa and Mozambique&quot;

* Ressano Garcia (first stop in Mozambique)
* Moamba
* Lourenço Marques (Maputo since 1975)
* &quot;Maputo Bay&quot; - (end)

(*) In the above list, only the major settlements on the line are named; the station names are not given.

The line was officially inaugurated on 1 January 1895. Today the line runs through the South African provinces of Gauteng and Mpumalanga. These two provinces, which previously made up the Transvaal Province, contain part of the territory of the former ZAR (along with Limpopo).

After the completion of the Pretoria - Maputo line, a second, much shorter line was laid down between Pretoria and Johannesburg. It adopted the of the neighbouring Cape Government Railways.

== Other Lines ==

In addition to the Randtram and Pretoria - Delagoa Bay Lines the NZASM operated another 4 lines: 
* Kaapmuiden - Barberton, a 55 kilometre (ca. 34 miles) sideline of the &quot;Oosterlijn&quot;.
* &quot;Zuiderlijn&quot; (South Line), intended to connect to the Cape Colony via the Orange Free State, ran from Pretoria - Kaalfontein - Zuurfontein - Elandsfontein (Johannesburg) - Vereeniging - Viljoensdrift (border with the Orange Free State). The total line from Pretoria to Cape Town was 1674 kilometres (ca. 1040 miles), of which 125 kilometres (ca. 78 miles) was controlled by the NZASM. 
* &quot;Zuid-Oosterlijn&quot; (Southeast Line), intended to connect to the Colony of Natal, ran from Elandsfontein (Johannesburg) - Heidelberg - Standerton - Charleston - Volksrust (border with the Colony of Natal). The total line from Pretoria to Durban was 812 kilometres (ca. 505 miles), of which 256 kilometres (ca. 160 miles) were part of the &quot;Zuid-Oosterlijn&quot;.
* &quot;Zuid-Westerlijn&quot; (Southwest Line), intended to connect to the Orange Free State, ran from Krugersdorp - Potchefstroom - Klerksdorp (border with the Orange Free State) with a length of 156 kilometres (ca. 97 miles).

A 1 kilometre track at Elandsfontein near Johannesburg provided a connection between the &quot;Zuiderlijn&quot;, the &quot;Zuid-Oosterlijn&quot;, and the &quot;Zuid-Westerlijn&quot;.

=== Barberton branch line ===
In 1882, George Pigot Moodie, Surveyor General of the ZAR, suggested that the &quot;Oosterlijn&quot; needed to reach Ermelo through the Cape River Valley rather than through Nelspruit. This was all later rendered moot, as the discovery of gold in 1884 in the Cape Valley near Barberton required the building of a branch line to the mines. The cost of construction was so significant, given the mountainous terrain, that the ZAR government objected. The local business Lewis, Marks &amp; Watkins formed a syndicate to build the line and the work was contracted to Pettegrew &amp; Co. After heavy rain damaged the bridge, the contractor went bankrupt and the syndicate was dissolved. NZASM took over construction and completed the line in 1896.

=== &quot;Zuiderlijn&quot; ===
The &quot;Zuiderlijn&quot; was the NZASM&#x27;s shortest line leaving the ZAR, but was the also the furthest distance inland. In 1888, the Cape Colony and Orange Free State governments agreed to build a railway between Port Elizabeth and Bloemfontein. The Cape government paid for the line and it was built by the Cape Government Railways (CGR). The section from Port Elizabeth to Colesberg was already complete, and the line from Colesberg to Bloemfontein opened on 17 December 1890.

The building of the &quot;Oosterlijn&quot; progressed slowly by comparison. In May 1890, the rapid population growth of Johannesburg and the need to ship in heavy mining equipment required a railway to reach the city. In June 1890, the ZAR assented to the building of a line between Pretoria and the Vaal River bridge. Construction began two months later, but the NZASM had financial problems and the project stalled.

Through an agreement made by James Silverwright, a member of the Afrikaner Bond and of Cecil Rhodes&#x27;s cabinet, the Cape Colony&#x27;s own CGR built its own line to Pretoria. The CGR would operate the ZAR portion of the line for two years before handing it over to the NZASM. On 7 May 1892, the line was completed from Bloemfontein to the Vaal River Bridge (the border of the ZAR); on 15 September 1892, the line from the Vaal River Bridge to Germiston (65 km) opened; and on 1 January 1893, Pretoria was connected to Cape Town as well as Port Elizabeth.

Upon completion of this railway line, it became possible to import heavy machinery, both for gold mining and for the construction of the western portion of the &quot;Oosterlijn&quot;.

=== &quot;Zuid-Oosterlijn&quot; ===
The &quot;Zuid-Oosterlijn&quot; was the last of the three NZASM lines connected to foreign rail lines and the coast.

After the discovery of gold, the Cape Colony and the Colony of Natal raced to connect the Rand with the coast. Until the line from Ladysmith reached Newcastle, the governments of Natal and the ZAR agreed to extend the line from Newcastle to the Rand. The line reached Newcastle on 15 May 1890, and was immediately extended to Charlestown, the last town in Natal leading up to the ZAR border. The railway, which climbed 452 m in the 57 km between Newcastle and Charlestown, was opened by President Kruger of the ZAR and the Governor of Natal on 7 April 1891. When it reached Laing&#x27;s Nek Pass, a 674-m tunnel was built to move it through. The NGR (Natal Government Railways) line had already reached Charlestown on 7 April 1891, but President Kruger did not give them permission to extend their line into the ZAR before the &quot;Oosterlijn&quot; was finished to Delagoa Bay.

The Delagoa Bay line was commissioned on 1 January 1895. In accordance with the terms of an agreement forged on 3 February 1894, between the ZAR government and the NGR, the NGR built the 250-km link between the Natal-ZAR border and the existing NZASM rail network. The first portion of 210 km between the border and Heidelberg opened on 27 April 1895, and the remainder opened on 15 November of that same year. On 1 December 1895, the 4-km link between the border and Charlestown opened, and that 15 December, the 41-km link between Heidelberg and Union Junction (9 km from Germiston) opened.

In November 1894, the ZAR and Great Britain agreed to meet in Swaziland, with President Kruger and the British High Commissioner Sir Henry Loch as signatories. Neither Kruger nor Loch&#x27;s countries recognized each other diplomatically, and therefore a passenger wagon was wheeled onto the bridge in between and the negotiators returned to their home countries. As the agreement was signed a year before the line&#x27;s opening, it appears that this short rail line was completed before the Volksrust-Standerton line was built, and that it was used to transport railway construction goods to the area.

The government of Natal paid for the line. They were eager to pay the costs since they anticipated profits that would more than cover the expense.

=== &quot;Zuid-Westerlijn&quot; ===
In 1885, the Cape railway reached Kimberley, and the following year, when the ZAR had difficulty obtaining a £5,000 loan and McMurdo struggled to build the Delagoa Bay line through the swamps near Delagoa Bay, President Kruger and the Cape government proposed extending the Kimberley line to near the Rand. No agreement was reached, and therefore the &quot;Zuid-Westerlijn&quot; started as a domestic rather than an international line.

Gold was discovered in August 1886 on Rietvlei Farm near Klerksdorp, and therefore the &quot;Randtram&quot; line was built between Krugersdorp and Springs. On 18 August 1884, the Volksraad decided to build a line between Krugersdrop and Klerksdorp. This line, the &quot;Zuid-Westerlijn&quot;, was an extension of the Randtram with the same gauge. NZASM was not eager to build the line since they realized it would be unprofitable. Eventually, the ZAR government and NZASM agreed that the government would cover half of the costs and guarantee the NZASM&#x27;s interest. The route was surveyed during the first half of 1894, and on 18 September of that year, the Volksraad granted the permit to start construction. Construction began on 18 July 1895, and after the work was delayed by the Jameson Raid, the line opened to near Potchefstroom on 11 July 1897, and finally began serving Klerksdorp on 3 August.

In 1897, the line carried 3,975 passengers boarding at Klersdorp station, more than 270 tons of freight, and around 1,848 horses, livestock, and vehicles. Income was £5,976, but expenses were £6,779. At the beginning of 1898, to help the gold mining industry, railway tariffs were lowered, despite losses growing to £13,047 by the end of that year.

In 1905, after the NZASM was merged into the Central South African Railways (CSAR), the &quot;Zuidwesterlijn&quot; was extended to Fourteen Streams (near Warrenton), and today the line is served by the Blue Train.

== Locomotives ==
The NZASM did not classify locomotives into specific classes - the eight types used in their fleet were known by their weight.

At the end of the 19th century, the German locomotive industry was growing rapidly and had outpaced that of the United Kingdom. Since the NZASM was a Dutch company financed by 50% Dutch and 47% German capital, most of its locomotives were German-built. Out of 258 locomotives in the fleet, 249 were designed by the German firm Maschinenfabrik Esslingen, six by the British manufacturer Manning Wardle, and Louis Smulders &amp; Co. out of Utrecht, Netherlands. Although most of the locomotives were built by their developers, 26 of the Esslingen locomotives were built by Smulders.

When the Second Boer War broke out, the Pretoria-Pietersburg rail line was expropriated from its British owners by the ZAR government and placed under the control of the NZASM. The PPS locomotives were all manufactured in the UK.

==The South African War to the Present==
In 1899 shortly after the outbreak of the South African War, also known as the Second Boer War (1899–1902), the government of the ZAR exercised its rights in accordance to the concession granted to the NZASM to place the company under government control. Towards the end of the war, the company, along with the rail company of the Orange Free State (OVSM), was placed under military control by the British, and in 1904 the NZASM and the OVSM were merged into the Central South African Railways.

After protracted negotiations, NZASM&#x27;s shareholders and creditors were given some compensation for debts and losses incurred by the company being seized by the British. The NZASM was formally dissolved in 1908, and the final financial statements were presented to shareholders in 1909. The company also published a book, &quot;In Memoriam&quot;, about the history of the NZASM in 1910. The money from the company&#x27;s liquidation was used to establish the Zuid-Afrikaansche Stichting Moederland (ZASM) in 1908. The ZASM is an organization dedicated to the advancement of cultural and economic ties between the Netherlands and South Africa. The ZASM also purchased a building in Amsterdam to house the organization&#x27;s archives and collections, including a part of the NZASM&#x27;s archives. This building is now used by a variety of organizations under the common banner &quot;Zuid-Afrikahuis&quot; (South Africa House).

A great deal of the NZASM&#x27;s infrastructure including bridges, drains, houses, and stations still exists and in many cases is still owned and actively used by Transnet. Several of the NZASM locomotives have survived and now form part of the Outeniqua Transport Museum&#x27;s collection.

In 1916, shortly after the establishment of the Union of South Africa, the Central South African Railways was merged with the railways of the former English Cape (Cape Government Railways) and Natal (Natal Government Railways) Colonies, resulting in the establishment of the South African Rail and Harbour Administration or Spoornet. In 1980, Spoornet was renamed to Transnet, and it was granted company status in 1990.

The NZASM archives may be found in the South African National Archives in South Africa; the Dutch National Archives in the Netherlands; and in the archives of the Zuid-Afrikahuis and the Dutch Economic History Archive (NEHA), both in Amsterdam. The NZASM photos in the collection of the Zuid-Afrikahuis have also been digitized and may be viewed online. NZASM related archival material may also be found in various other archives, including The National Archives of the United Kingdom.

<doc id="1247115" wikidata="Q1441564" url="?curid=1247115" title="Michoud Assembly Facility">
<text>The Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) is an industrial complex for the manufacture and structural assembly of aerospace vehicles and components. It is owned by NASA and located in New Orleans East, a section of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the United States. Organizationally it is part of NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center, and is currently a multi-tenant complex to allow commercial and government contractors, as well as government agencies, to use the site.

MAF is one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world with 43 environmentally controlled acres——under one roof, and it employs more than 4,200 people. From September 1961 to the end of the Apollo program in December 1972 the site was utilized by Chrysler Corporation to build the first stages of the Saturn I and Saturn IB, later joined by Boeing Corporation to build the first stage of the Saturn V rockets. From September 5, 1973, to September 20, 2010, the factory was used for the construction of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s external fuel tanks by Martin Marietta Corporation.

==History==
The facility was originally constructed in 1940 at the village of Michoud, Louisiana, by the Higgins-Tucker division of Higgins Industries under the direction of Andrew Jackson Higgins. Construction was done on behalf of the United States government for the war production during World War II of plywood C-76 cargo planes and the Higgins Boat landing craft. The project cost $180 million ($2.8 billion in 2018). Production of the C-76 never commenced and instead produced 2 Curtiss C-46 Commando in 1943 and remaining order cancelled in 1944. The facility was referred to as Michoud (Factory) Airfield in the 1940s and briefly as a National Guard field in 1949, but became inactive by 1952. 
During the Korean War it made engines for Sherman and Patton tanks, and boasted a paved runway. It came under the management of NASA in 1961, and was used for the construction of the S-IC first stage of the Saturn V rockets and the S-IB first stage of the Saturn IB rockets built by Chrysler Corporation. It is home to the first stage of the last-constructed Saturn V, SA-515, built by The Boeing Company. The factory&#x27;s ceiling height limitation - 12 meters, was unable to allow the construction of the bigger Saturn C-8 direct Moon vehicle, and therefore was one of the major reasons why the smaller C-5 (later renamed Saturn V) was chosen instead of the originally planned Moon vehicle. The runway was slowly transformed into Saturn Boulevard in the 1960s with the middle becoming a heliport and decommissioned by the 1970s.

The majority of the NASA factory&#x27;s history was focused on construction and production of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle external tank (ET). Beginning with the rollout of ET-1 on June 29, 1979, which flew on STS-1, 136 tanks were produced throughout the Space Shuttle program, ending with the flight-ready tank ET-122, which flew on STS-134, rolled out on September 20, 2010. A single tank produced at the facility, ET-94, was not used in spaceflight and remained at Michoud as a test article.

Modular parts for the International Space Station were fabricated at the facility in the mid-1990s until 2010.

The factory is now the location for the Space Launch System (SLS)&#x27;s core and future second stage construction by Boeing. SLS is the most powerful rocket in the history of spaceflight. It carries the Orion spacecraft, whose crew module is also being built at Michoud, but by Lockheed Martin. It has 50% more volume than the Apollo command capsule and will carry four to six astronauts. The first launch occurred on November 16, 2022.

=== Hurricane Katrina ===

The facility did not experience significant flooding during Hurricane Katrina due to a natural ridge that runs along its northwestern boundary, the levee that makes up the southern and eastern boundaries, and the work of the pump operators who stayed to protect the facility during the storm. Several buildings sustained wind and rainwater damage. All shifts were initially canceled up to September 26, 2005, potentially setting back future Shuttle flights. All the buildings and the shuttle hardware within survived the hurricane without grave damage, but the roof of the main manufacturing building was breached and debris damaged ET-122 stored inside; that tank was refurbished and later flew on the final flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;, STS-134. Thirty-eight NASA and Lockheed Martin employees stayed behind during Hurricane Katrina to operate the pumping systems, knowing that if not activated and sustained, the facility would have been destroyed. The workers pumped more than one billion gallons (3,800,000 m3) of water out of the facility and probably were the reason that the rocket factory suffered very little damage. These employees were each awarded the NASA Exceptional Bravery Medal, NASA&#x27;s highest bravery award.

On September 16, 2005 NASA announced that the repairs were progressing faster than anticipated, and so they would continue to use Michoud for external tank work. On October 3, 2005, the facility officially reopened for essential personnel, though some key personnel had returned earlier. On October 31, 2005, the facility reopened to all personnel.

On February 7, 2017, an EF3 tornado carved a path through Orleans Parish, in which the factory is located. Two major buildings including the main manufacturing building were damaged, with multiple broken windows. 5 people were injured, and resulting repairs and other factors contributed to the delay of the first SLS launch until late 2022.

== Buildings ==

The facility consists of various buildings in one complex:

* The main manufacturing building (Building number 103), and the North and South Vertical Assembly Buildings (Building numbers 115 and 110 respectively). The North VAB was constructed in 2011, initially to add new vertical welding equipment. The main manufacturing building is where the majority of preliminary fabrication and welding activities take place - the Space Launch System core stage (and previously the Space Shuttle External Tank, ISS modular components, and the Saturn V first stage) were manufactured here. Engine installation for the SLS core stage for Artemis 1 and 2 occurs here. The building stretches 512 by 340 meters in dimensions, and contains over 40 sub-areas for different manufacturing and structural assembly operations. A series of internal roads made from polished concrete provide ease of access by factory vehicles, trams, and overhead cranes to move components around. They run the whole length of the factory building. Factory floor office buildings and engineering rooms located in various ends of the main manufacturing building. Near the South VAB is an electric arc furnace and casting equipment. In front of the main manufacturing building is the administration offices, lobby, restaurants and engineering conference rooms. There is also a gym, media lab, a medical area and a cafeteria provided for the workers. Facing north is a factory floor museum display area, with mission patches, flags and memorials.
* An external building that is used to manufacture smaller components and space station equipment, for example small components for the International Space Station. It also supplies various small components such as fasteners to the main building. 
* Another external building for various manufacturing processes, and contains a laboratory, office space and technical storage areas.
* Adjacent to the main manufacturing building are more foam application workshops, power transformers for the arc furnace and other facilities, and large amounts of open space. In front of the South VAB, rocket parts are moved from this building to the side internal workshops across the plaza for inspection and checks.
* The National Finance Center (NSF) - was formerly located west of the complex; housed offices for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and contained several large conference rooms, a restaurant and a ballroom for NASA employees and visitor events. The building was badly damaged by a tornado in 2017, which rendered the building irreparable. It was subsequently demolished in 2019 and a new replacement is yet to be built.

The shipping port is located 600 meters southwest of the main manufacturing building. Transporting vehicles carrying manufactured SLS components move down Saturn Blvd, past large open fields, to the pier - where the Pegasus Barge is docked. This is where the components are shipped to either their final destination - Kennedy Space Center, or rarely back to the main Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, or the John C. Stennis Space Center in Mississippi for testing.

== Other activities ==

The Michoud Assembly Facility also houses other organizations such as the National Finance Center operated by the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States Coast Guard, and GE.

The factory complex is open to the public (though through pre-booking in advance). Visitors must sign in at main reception and clear security.

NASA planned to use the rocket factory to build the structure for several components of the cancelled Constellation program, including the Orion spacecraft, the Ares I Upper Stage, and the Ares V Core Stage. Under the Obama administration, the Constellation Program was cancelled in 2010, but was replaced with SLS a year later to continue space exploration efforts.

NASA has an agreement in place to rent out a portion of the facility to Big Easy Studios, a New Orleans film studio. This deal has been criticized by competing studios as violating NASA&#x27;s rule that any deal with an outside entity must serve the agency&#x27;s mission and must not compete with the private sector. NASA officials defend the agreement, stating that this helps to offset the cost of unused space on the facility and that their pricing is vetted by state and local economic development agencies to ensure it is not competing with the private market. Portions of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, &quot;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&quot;, and &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot; were filmed at the factory.

==Incidents ==

On May 24, 1988, TACA Flight 110 operated with a Boeing 737-300 jetliner made a successful emergency landing on a grassy levee in the Michoud grounds after power was lost in both engines during a severe thunderstorm. The aircraft was towed into the Michoud facility, where its engines were replaced. On 6 June, it took off, with a crew of two and minimal fuel, using the former runway at Michoud, which had been reused as a road, Saturn Boulevard. It was flown the short distance to New Orleans International Airport, where it was fully repaired.
