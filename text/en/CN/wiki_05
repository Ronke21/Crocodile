<text>The TMS9900 was one of the first commercially available single-chip 16-bit microprocessors. Introduced in June 1976, it implemented Texas Instruments&#x27;s TI-990 minicomputer architecture in a single-chip format, and was initially used for low-end models of that lineup.

Its 64-pin DIP format made it more expensive to implement in smaller machines than the more common 40-pin format, and it saw relatively few design wins outside TI&#x27;s own use. Among those uses was their TI-99/4 and TI-99/4A home computers, which ultimately sold about 2.8 million units.

By the mid-1980s, the microcomputer field was moving to 16-bit systems such as the Intel 8086 and newer 16/32-bit designs such as the Motorola 68000. With no obvious future for the chip, TI&#x27;s Semiconductor division turned its attention to special-purpose 32-bit processors: the Texas Instruments TMS320, introduced in 1983, and the Texas Instruments TMS340 graphics processor. 

The 9900 architecture lived on into the 1990s as the Communications Processor in TI&#x27;s TMS380 chipset for Token Ring networking (later Ethernet).

==History==

The TMS9900 was designed as a single-chip version of the TI 990 minicomputer series, much like the Intersil 6100 was a single chip PDP-8 (12 bits), and the Fairchild 9440 and Data General mN601 were both one-chip versions of Data General&#x27;s Nova. Unlike multi-chip 16-bit microprocessors such as the National Semiconductor IMP-16 or DEC LSI-11, some of which predated the TMS9900, the 9900 was a single-chip, self-contained 16-bit microprocessor.

The minicomputer roots of the TMS9900 give rise to a number of architectural features that are not commonly found on designs that started from a blank sheet. Notable among these was the TMS9900&#x27;s use of processor registers that are mapped into main memory. This allows for fast context switching, which can be accomplished by changing a single register, the Workspace Pointer, to point to the first entry in a list of register values. More traditional designs would require the entire set of internal registers to be stored out to memory or the stack.

The downside to this approach is that accessing these registers is much slower. In a minicomputer implementation with fast memory, the effect is relatively small and the upside in a real-time or multi-tasking environment is significant as context switches are common. In other roles, like single-user microcomputers, this tradeoff may not be worthwhile. The 40-pin implementations of the 9900 included 128 or 256 bytes of fast onboard RAM for registers.

TI used the same architecture across different divisions for corporate synergy: &quot;one company, one computer architecture&quot;. In the late 1970s Walden C. Rhines gave a presentation of the TMS99110, then code-named &quot;Alpha&quot;, to an IBM group developing a personal computer. &quot;We wouldn&#x27;t know until 1981 just what we had lost&quot; because IBM chose the Intel 8088 for the IBM PC, he recalled. One factor was the lack of a roadmap for accessing more than 64KB of logical memory. The 9900 family could expand its address space to 16 MiB only by page-mapping; the 9900 could address 256K through segments.

After dropping out of the personal computer market after products such as TI-99/4A, the company microprocessor division eventually switched focus to the TMS320 special-purpose processor series.

Microcomputer-on-chip implementations of variations of the 9900 in 40-pin packages included the TMS9940, TMS9980/81, and TMS9995. The SBP9900 was a ruggedized version. 

The last generation was the 99000 series, created to be the CPU of the 990/10A in 1981. The TMS99105 and 110 were sold as catalog parts.

==Architecture==
The TMS9900 has three internal 16-bit registers — the Program counter (PC), the Status register (ST), and the Workspace Pointer register (WP). The WP points to a base address in external RAM where 16 general purpose user registers (each 16 bits wide) reside to serve the processor. This architecture allows for quick context switching; e.g. when a subroutine is entered, only the single workspace register needs to be changed instead of requiring registers to be saved individually. As with the Motorola 68000, bits are numbered with the MSB (most significant bit) being bit 0.

Addresses refer to bytes with big endian ordering convention. The TMS9900 is a classic 16-bit machine with an address space of 216 bytes (65,536 bytes or 32,768 words).

There is no dedicated stack pointer register. Instead, branch instructions exist that save the program counter to a register (BL — Branch and Link), or change the register context (BLWP — Branch and Link Workspace Pointer, or XOP). The 16 hardware and 16 software interrupt vectors each consist of a pair of PC and WP values, so the register context switch is automatically performed by an interrupt as well. Stacks can be implemented atop either of these mechanisms.

==Instruction set and addressing==
The TMS9900 has 69 instructions which are either one, two, or three words long and are always word-aligned in memory. The instruction set is fairly orthogonal, meaning that, with few exceptions, instructions can use all methods of accessing operands (addressing modes).

Addressing modes include Immediate (operand in instruction), Direct or &quot;Symbolic&quot; (operand address in instruction), Register (operand in workspace register), Register Indirect (operand address in workspace register) with or without auto-increment, Indexed (operand address in instruction indexed with workspace register content), and Program Counter Relative.

The most important dual-operand instructions (add, subtract, compare, move etc.) have 2-bit addressing mode and 4-bit register selector fields for both source and destination operands. In the opcode, &quot;Symbolic&quot; mode is represented as Indexed mode with the register field set to 0, therefore workspace register 0 (WR0) cannot be used in Indexed mode. In less-frequently-used dual-operand instructions such as XOR, the destination operand must be a workspace register (or workspace register pair in the case of multiply and divide instructions).

Flow control is facilitated through a group of one unconditional and 12 conditional jump instructions. Jump targets are relative to the PC with an offset of -128 to +127 word addresses.

For subroutine calls, the Branch and Load Workspace Pointer (BLWP) instruction loads new WP and PC values, then saves the values of WP, PC, and ST to (new) registers 13, 14, and 15 respectively. At the end of the subroutine, the Return Workspace Pointer (RTWP) restores these in reverse order. Using BLWP/RTWP, it is possible to nest subroutine calls despite the absence of a stack, however, the programmer needs to assign the appropriate register workspace explicitly.

The instruction set also contains a Branch and Link (BL) opcode that only saves PC to register 11 without changing WP. In this case, a branch instruction (B) using WR11 as the destination address can serve as the return opcode, but BL-type subroutines cannot be nested without the programmer taking actions to save the return address.

The TMS9900 supports an execute instruction &quot;X&quot; (eXecute). This instruction executes the instruction in a register. It can be used for debugging (as a breakpoint instruction), for creating indexed-opcode tables as used in byte-code interpreters and can also be used to perform a time critical I/O instruction during an interrupt. An example of its utility is shown in the code below where an interrupt is being serviced in a very encapsulated manner that would otherwise require many more instructions. 

This common piece of code during the interrupt could be used by both I/O read and write commands. Similar methods could be employed in any debugging methods wanting to be used.

The TMS9900 also supports the eXtended OPeration (XOP) instruction. XOP is given a number in the range 0–15 as well as a source address. When invoked, the instruction will perform a context switch through one of sixteen vectors at predefined locations in memory. The XOP instruction also places the effective address of the source operand in register 11 of the new workspace. The context-saving feature of the XOP instruction can also be used as to implement inline debugging. 

XOP is less flexible than a BLWP, as the transfer vectors have to be at fixed locations, but allows one source operand to be directly addressed rather than passed in a register or otherwise.

XOP can be used to implement a system call facility. In TI&#x27;s DX10 operating system, XOP 15 invokes a system call. A programmer might define an assembler macro, for example SVC, which invokes XOP 15. Another use of XOP was to implement instructions in software which might be handled by dedicated hardware in future versions of the 990 minicomputer series. An example of such actions can be shown in the code below where a CALL function is implemented using and XOP 6 Instruction. The beauty of this implementation of a CALL function using an XOP is that it is straightforward to add checks to determine if the stack overflowed, for example C R10,@2*R9(R13), where R9 points to the address of the stack limit.
In typical comparisons with the Intel 8086, the TMS9900 had smaller programs. Some disadvantages were the small address space and need for fast RAM.

==Implementation==
The TMS9900 was implemented in an N-channel silicon gate MOS process, which required +5 V, −5 V and +12 V power supplies and a four-phase (non-overlapping) clock with a maximum frequency of 3 MHz (333 ns cycle), usually generated from a 48 MHz crystal using a TIM9904 (aka 74LS362) clock generator chip.

The shortest instructions require eight clock cycles or 2.7 μs to complete (assuming 0 external wait cycles), many others run between 10 and 14 cycles (3.3...4.7 μs); the longest-running instruction (DIV) can take up to 124 cycles (41.3 μs).

Like the Motorola 68000, the chip was packaged in a (then-unusual) 64-pin, 0.9 wide DIP. The comparatively large number of pins allowed for the 15-bit (word) address bus and 16-bit data bus to be brought out on dedicated pins without the use of multiplexing (unlike e.g. the Intel 8086 CPU), keeping external memory connections simple. Like Motorola, contrary to the convention used by many other manufacturers, TI labeled the most significant address and data lines &quot;A0&quot; and &quot;D0,&quot; respectively. All internal data paths and the ALU are 16 bits wide.

The processor can be paused with the address bus tri-stated for external direct memory access (DMA). Memory accesses are always 16 bits wide, with the CPU automatically performing read-before-write operations for instructions with byte-wide accesses.

The hardware interrupt system supports a 4-bit interrupt priority input, which needed to be higher than the priority level stored in the status register (bits 12–15) in order for the interrupt request to be served. In addition, the &quot;/LOAD&quot; input provides a non-maskable interrupt facility with a dedicated vector.

The TMS9900 CPU also contains a 16-bit shift register (&quot;CRU&quot;) designed for interfacing with external shift registers, with dedicated instructions supporting access to fields of between 1 and 16 bits width out of a total of 4,096 addressable bits.

Parallel peripherals can be attached in memory-mapped fashion to the regular address and data bus.

==Applications==
The TMS9900 was used in the TI-99/4 and TI-99/4A home computers. Unfortunately, to reduce the production costs, TI chose to use just 256 bytes (128 16-bit words) of the fast kind of RAM that the TMS9900 could access directly. The rest of the memory was 16 KB of 8-bit DRAM that was accessible only indirectly through the video display controller, which crippled the performance of these machines.

TI developed the TM990 series of computer modules, including CPU, memory, and I/O, which, when plugged into a card frame, could form a 16-bit minicomputer. These were typically used for process control. A microprocessor trainer was released in the form of the TM990/189.

In the late 1970s, John Walker and Dan Drake developed S100-bus cards based on the TMS9900 and a full software stack to go with it. They later went on to be co-founders of Autodesk, which was in part based on software first developed for these TMS9900 based systems.

==TMS9900 Family Product Development==
The next generation of the TMS9900 was the TMS9995, which provided &quot;functional performance at speeds three times faster than any previous 9900 family processor,&quot; largely due to the inclusion of instruction prefetch technology. In the home computer arena, the TMS9995 only found use in the Tomy Tutor, as well as an obscure third-party computer-on-a-card upgrade for the TI-99/4A called the Geneve 9640, and a project printed in &quot;Electronics Today&quot;: the Powertran Cortex. It was planned to be used in the TI-99/2 and TI-99/8 computer systems, but neither advanced past the prototype stage.

TI later developed the more powerful TMS99000 family of microprocessors, which was used as the CPU in the 990/10A minicomputer as a cost reduction. Ultimately, by the time the 990/10A made it to market, the end of the minicomputer era was already in sight.

The TMS99000 family includes two microprocessors, the TMS99105A and the TMS99110A, which are identical except for the contents of on-chip macrostore ROM memory (macrostore memory contains added functions or instructions through emulation routines written in standard machine code). The on-chip ROM Macrostore in the TMS99110A microprocessor contains floating point instructions which are available as part of the machine language instruction set, while the baseline TMS99105A does not. Both chips can implement Macrostore instructions in an external ROM. A third member of the TMS99000 family, the TMS99120, was announced but may never have been commercially produced. The on-chip ROM Macrostore in the TMS99120 was to contain run-time support routines for the PASCAL high-level language.

The instruction set for the TMS99000 family extends the 9900 instruction set while maintaining compatibility. The additional instructions include those for signed multiply and divide (first appearing in the TMS9995); long-word shift, add, and subtract; load status register; load workspace pointer; stack operations; multiprocessor support; and bit manipulation. Members of the family can access 256 KB of memory through code/data segmentation, and may use the TIM99610 memory mapper to address up to 16 MiB. The architecture contains many other advances over the TMS9900/TMS9995.

<text>Baden Chapman Teague (born 18 September 1944) is an Australian former politician who served as a Liberal senator for South Australia from 1977 until his retirement in 1996. 

Born in Adelaide, Teague was educated at St. Peter’s College, the University of Adelaide and Cambridge University, where he gained a Ph.D. He was employed as a university lecturer until he entered the Senate in 1977. Teague narrowly won the final South Australian Senate position from the then newly formed Australian Democrats after preferences from the Australia Party flowed to Teague ahead of the Democrats. Observers with a sense of irony would have noted that many Australian Democrats, including lead Democrat Senate candidate Ian Gilfillan, were former Australia Party members and the Democrats had initially expected Australia Party preferences.

During his Senate term, Teague introduced a private members bill to change the system of government in Australia from a Constitutional Monarchy to a Republic. 

Following his retirement from politics, Teague served as the South Australian Chairman of the Australian Republican Movement, and was elected as a delegate to the Australian Republic Convention.

<text>Presidential elections were held in France on 26 April 1981, with a second round on 10 May. François Mitterrand defeated incumbent president, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing to become the first Socialist president of the Fifth Republic. It is the first presidential election in French history that an incumbent president actively seeking reelection was denied a second term.

In the first round of voting on 26 April 1981, a political spectrum of ten candidates stood for election, and the leading two candidates – Mitterrand and Giscard d&#x27;Estaing – advanced to a second round. Mitterrand and his Socialist Party received 51.76% of the vote, while Giscard and his Union for French Democracy trailed with about 48.24%, a margin of 1,065,956 votes.

The Socialist Party&#x27;s electoral program was called 110 Propositions for France. Mitterrand served as President of France for the full seven-year term (1981–1988) and won re-election in 1988.

== Electoral system ==
If Giscard&#x27;s internal political handicaps had effectively &quot;crippled&quot; him in the initial race, the external factors that decided the 1981 election were a deadly blow. Neatly summarized in an article by Hugh Dauncey: &quot;It was Giscard&#x27;s double misfortune that his presidency should be blighted both by unprecedented economic difficulties, and by a political system which was stubbornly unreceptive to the ouverture and centralist compromise that he required for his reforms to fully succeed&quot;. The electoral and party system (political system) in France had, indeed, undergone many critical changes during the previous years. In particular the introduction of the two-round, majority vote requirement played a large role in the election of 1981. The new electoral system divided the various right and left factions within themselves during the first round, but led to right and left polarization during the second round. That forced the right and the left to strategize for both the first and second parts of the election.

In the first round, candidates must present themselves as the better candidate while being careful not to remove all credibility of his/her fellow right or left candidates, as their opponents may have to run again in the next round against the opposing right or left candidate. (It is much the same in US primary elections.)

In the second round, however, total unity must be achieved. That leads to the movement of both groups toward the center, with coalitions between center groups and extremists within the right and left.

=== Division tactics ===
The new electoral &quot;rules of the game&quot;, was one of the most notable factors that decided the 1981 election. The division within the right between the two main factions, Giscard&#x27;s Union pour la démocratie française (UDF) and Chirac&#x27;s neo-Gaullist Rassemblement pour la République (RPR), proved to be the final blow to Giscard (Painton, par. 12). When Chirac lost the &quot;primary,&quot; he refused to advise his supporters to back Giscard in the runoff though he stated that he would vote for Giscard. In effect, Chirac refused to endorse Giscard as the sole candidate of the centre-right.

There was also the tactical ingenuity on the part of the Left that brought about Mitterrand&#x27;s victory. As author Penniman points out, in a shrewd move, the left gained &quot;strength through disunity&quot;. The right&#x27;s disunity between the UDF and RPR factions brought about the downfall of their major candidate. The split between the left&#x27;s Socialist and Communist Parties, however, allowed the electorate to be more comfortable voting for the Socialists while it gained Communist votes, which were roughly 20% of the electorate.

<text>Helensville () is a town in the North Island of New Zealand. It is sited northwest of Auckland, close to the southern extremity of the Kaipara Harbour. State Highway 16 passes through the town, connecting it to Waimauku to the south, and Kaukapakapa about to the north-east. Parakai is to the north-west. The Kaipara River runs through the town and into the Kaipara Harbour to the north.

Tāmaki Māori settled the southern Kaipara Harbour in the 13th or 14th centuries, drawn by the marine and forest resources. The upper reaches of the Kaipara River was the location of Te Tōangaroa, a portage where waka could be hauled between the Kaipara Harbour and the Waitematā Harbour. By the 15th century, the area had become home to some of the earliest pā sites in the Auckland Region. By the early 18th century, Ngāti Whātua, who had traditional ties to the area, had re-established themselves along the Kaipara River.

Helensville was established as a kauri logging settlement in 1862, developing into a regional centre for the south Kaipara by the 1870s. Helensville became a major centre for the dairy industry between 1911 and the 1980s.

==Etymology==

The name Helensville comes from early settler John McLeod, and is a version of Helen&#x27;s Villa, his house, that he named after his wife Helen Alexander. The first known references in print to Helensville date to 1863. The Māori language name, , means &quot;The Wide River&quot;, and is the name of a tributary stream that meets the Kaipara River at Helensville.

==Geography==
Helensville is located on the eastern banks of the Kaipara River, to the south of the Kaipara Harbour. The town is located between two tributaries of the river: the Awaroa Stream to the north, and the Mangakura Stream in the south. The town is located on a spur in the hills slightly higher than the surrounding area, of which the highest point is a hill located to the south called Paehoka, at the junction between Kiwitahi Road and Old North Road.

The area has traditionally been a wetland and flood plain for the Kaipara River, until the late 19th century when the Kaipara River catchment was developed into farmland. Historically, the hills to the east of Helensville were a kauri-dominated forest.

==History==
===Māori history===

The Auckland Region has been settled by Māori since around the 13th or 14th centuries. Māori legends describe supernatural beings, the Tūrehu, as being the inhabitants of the area prior to Māori settlement. The Kaipara Harbour is associated with the Tūrehu Tumutumuwhenua and his wife Kui, of whom Ngāti Whātua (the modern-day iwi of the harbour) consider to be ancestors.

One of the earliest known iwi to settled in the area are Te Tini o Maruiwi, who descend from Maruiwi, captain of the &quot;Kahutara&quot;, one of the first migratory waka, and migrated north into the Kaipara Harbour. Ngāti Whātua traditions tell of the &quot;Māhuhu-ki-te-rangi&quot; migratory waka arriving at the Kaipara Harbour. Some of the crew members, including Rongomai, Mawete and Po, settled at Tāporapora, with the descendants of Toi, who already lived in the area. Tāporapora was a fertile sandy land that gradually eroded west of the Okahukura Peninsula, of which Manukapua Island is a remnant.

People were drawn to the southern Kaipara Harbour due to its rich resources from the harbour and surrounding kauri-dominated forests. Based on archaeological findings, many of the earliest people to come to the area caught moa. The southern Kaipara was an important transportation node due to Te Tōangaroa, a portage where waka could be hauled between the Kaipara Harbour and the Waitematā Harbour, via the Kaipara River and Kumeū River. Major settlements in the area were typically upland of the Kaipara River, due to the swampy ground immediately beside the river, and the Ohirangi wetlands ( were used to trap moa in ancient times).

Known traditional names for the area include , which describes the meandering Kaipara River near Helensville, and further upstream near the Helensville Bridge was known as .

Over time, many Tāmaki Māori developed the tribal identity Ngā Oho. Around the 15th century, a group known as Ngāti Awa who descended from the &quot;Mātaatua&quot; waka settled Te Korowai-o-Te-Tonga Peninsula, led by Tītahi. The iwi were prominent constructors of terraced pā. Over 18 pā sites can be found in the Helensville area, which likely represent some of the earliest fortified pā in Auckland. Ōtakanini pā, located near Parkhurst northwest of Helensville, has been dated to at least 1400AD.

By the mid-17th century, Ngāti Awa and Ngā Oho struggled to control territory. A descendant of Tītahi, Hauparoa, asked his relative Maki, a renowned warrior who lived at the Kāwhia Harbour, to help Ngāti Awa secure the region. Maki conquered and unified many of the Tāmaki Māori tribes, including Ngā Oho of the south Kaipara and West Auckland. After an incident where Maki unsuccessfully asked a slave steal kūmara from Hauparoa&#x27;s storage pits, Maki attacked Ngāti Awa. Over time, Maki&#x27;s descendants became known as Te Kawerau ā Maki; a name that references the kūmara incident. Maki chose the southern Kaipara as his base of operations, and his children migrated to different areas of the northern and western Auckland Region.

====Return of Ngāti Whātua and the Musket Wars====

In the 17th and early 18th centuries, Ngāti Whātua tribes began returning to the southern Kaipara Harbour area from Northland, primarily on the waka Te Potae o Wahieroa and Te Wharau. Initially relations between the iwi were friendly, and many important marriages were made. Hostilities broke out and Ngāti Whātua asked for assistance from Kāwharu, a famed Tainui warrior from Kawhia. Kāwharu&#x27;s repeated attacks of the Waitākere Ranges settlements became known as Te Raupatu Tīhore, or the stripping conquest. Lasting peace between Te Kawerau ā Maki and Ngāti Whātua was forged by Maki&#x27;s grandson Te Au o Te Whenua, who fixed the rohe (border) between Muriwai Beach and Rangitōpuni (Riverhead). Ngāti Whātua divided the land among different hapū, including Te Taoū, who were a major power in the Kaipara River catchment.

Around the year 1740, war broke out between Ngāti Whātua and Waiohua, the confederation of Tāmaki Māori tribes centred to the southeast, on the Tāmaki isthmus. Kiwi Tāmaki, paramount chief of Waiohua, led a surprise attack in the south Kaipara during an uhunga (funeral rite commemoration), in response for past grievances and to assist a Ngāti Whātua faction who were opposed to Te Taoū. Kiwi Tāmaki&#x27;s party pursued the survivors south to the pā at Te Mākiri (Te Awaroa / Helensville), confronting Tuperiri and Waha-akiaki, two prominent members of Te Taoū who managed to survive. By 1741, Ngāti Whātua had successfully fought against Kiwi Tāmaki, and members of Te Taoū established themselves on the Auckland isthmus.

An early skirmish between Te Taoū and Ngāpuhi during the Musket Wars occurred at Paehoka, south of Helensville, likely in the late 18th century. Conflict continued through the early 19th century, and in 1818 English missionary Samuel Marsden witnessed Ngāti Whātua of the Kaipara River being attacked from the north. Following the battle of Te Ika a Ranganui at Kaiwaka, Ngāti Whātua fled the area, except for a small contingent who remained for ahi kā (visible land occupation). Ngāti Whātua began returning to the Kaipara River from 1828, and were fully re-established by 1835.

===Early colonial era===


After the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840, Ngāti Whātua operated coastal trading vessels, supplying goods to early European settlers at Auckland. Large areas of the southern Kaipara harbour were purchased by the Crown between 1853 and 1865, in part due to Ngāti Whātua&#x27;s hope that this would lead to Europeans settlements developing and stimulate the economy of the area.

In 1862, Nova Scotian settler John McLeod established a kauri timber mill on the eastern banks of the Kaipara River, at the modern-day site of Helensville. McLeod named his house &quot;Helen&#x27;s Villa&quot;, after his wife, which became the name for the township that developed around the timber mill. McLeod milled the kauri on the lands adjacent to his timber mill, and after a few years, Ngāti Whātua established a kāinga on the opposite banks.

The town grew based on the kauri timber industry and kauri gum collection. In 1865, the road from Riverhead to Helensville was improved, and pastoral farms were developed in the 1870s. By 1870, Helensville had become the main trading centre and transportation junction for the Kaipara Harbour settlements to the north. From 1875 to 1881, a short-lived section of railway operated between Kumeū, south of Helensville, and the village of Riverhead, on the upper shores of the Waitematā Harbour. This led to increased economic activity in Helensville, which developed into a township and became an economic hub. In 1881, the North Auckland Line was extended to Helensville, leading to the opening of the Helensville railway station.

In 1879, St Matthew&#x27;s Anglican Church was established in Helensville. This was the first church in the wider southern Kaipara area, serving the surrounding rural communities such as Kumeū and Waimauku. In 1882, the first bridge across the Kaipara River was constructed at Te Horo Point, with the intention of this opening up farmland to the west.

Between 1865 and 1900, the Native Land Court individuated collectively-owned Ngāti Whātua lands, a gradual process which led to land alienation. By 1900, almost the entire southern Kaipara area had been alienated from Ngāti Whātua, and only 10% of their traditional rohe had been retained.

===Dairy industry and tourism===

The Kauri logging and gum industries went into decline by 1900, disappearing by 1920. The Helensville Show, an annual agricultural show, was established in 1900, becoming a major part of life at Helensville, and drawing people from the surrounding areas to the town. In 1911, the Kaipara Dairy Company was established in Helensville, becoming the town&#x27;s largest employer, and the town flourished due to the dairy industry and sheep farms. Additionally, tourists were drawn to Helensville in the early 20th century, due to the Parakai thermal springs.

In 1927, St Matthew&#x27;s Anglican Church was rebuilt after a new larger church was required. During the 1930s, an exotic pine forest called the Woodhill Forest was established on the Te Korowai-o-Te-Tonga Peninsula, becoming an important industry for the area. During World War II, the 15th Battalion of the Home Guard was based at Helensville.

The dairy factory closed in the late 1980s, due to a decline in farming profitability in the area. The sand extraction industry became a major employer in the town, after Mt Rex and Winstone established processing facilities near the town in the 1990s.

In 2009, the Helensville railway station was closed for passenger services.

==Government==
===Local===
From 1876 until 1947, Helensville was administered by the Waitemata County, a large rural county north and west of the city of Auckland. In 1883, the Helensville Town Board was formed to administer the area, within the Waitemata County. In 1947, Helensville split from the country to form an independent borough. In 1989, the borough merged with Rodney County, forming the Rodney District Council. Rodney District Council was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010.

Within the Auckland Council, Helensville is a part of the Rodney local government area governed by the Rodney Local Board. It is a part of the Rodney ward, which elects one councillor to the Auckland Council.

<text>ACF Industries, originally the American Car and Foundry Company (abbreviated as ACF), is an American manufacturer of railroad rolling stock. One of its subsidiaries was once (1925–54) a manufacturer of motor coaches and trolley coaches under the brand names of (first) ACF and (later) ACF-Brill. Today, the company is known as ACF Industries LLC and is based in St. Charles, Missouri. It is owned by investor Carl Icahn.

==History==
The American Car and Foundry Company was originally formed and incorporated in New Jersey in 1899 as a result of the merger of thirteen smaller railroad car manufacturers. The company was made up of:
Later in 1899, ACF acquired the Bloomsburg Car Manufacturing Company of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. Orders for new freight cars were made very quickly, with several hundred cars ordered in the first year alone. Two years later, ACF acquired the Jackson and Sharp Company (founded 1863 in Wilmington, Delaware) and the Common Sense Bolster Company (of Chicago, Illinois). The unified company made a large investment in the former Jackson &amp; Woodin plant in Pennsylvania, spending about $3 million. It was at this plant that ACF built the first all-steel passenger car in the world in 1904. The car was built for the Interborough Rapid Transit system of New York City, the first of 300 such cars ordered by that system.

In 1903, the company was operating overseas in Trafford Park, Manchester, England, and it was featured on a Triumphal Arch built for the Royal Visit of Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1903. The factory buildings were later used by Ford cars, which began manufacturing at Trafford Park in 1911.

1904 and 1905 saw ACF build several motor cars and trailers for the London Underground. In those two years, ACF also acquired the Southern Car and Foundry (founded 1899 in Memphis, Tennessee), Indianapolis Car and Foundry, and Indianapolis Car Company.

In 1916, William H. Woodin, formerly president of Jackson and Woodin Manufacturing Company, was promoted to become president of ACF. Woodin would later become Secretary of the Treasury under U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt.

During World War I, ACF produced artillery gun mounts and ammunition, submarine chasers and other boats, railway cars, and other equipment to support the Allies. ACF ranked 36th among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts.

==Products==

In the past, ACF built passenger and freight cars, including covered hopper cars for hauling such cargo as corn and other grains. One of the largest customers was the Union Pacific Railroad, whose armour-yellow carbon-steel lightweight passenger rolling stock was mostly built by ACF. The famous dome-observation car &quot;Native Son&quot; was an ACF product.

Another important ACF railroad production were the passenger cars of the Missouri River &quot;Eagle&quot;, a Missouri Pacific streamliner put in service in March 1940. This train, in its original shape, consisted of six cars including one baggage, one baggage-mail, two coaches one food and beverage car and finally the observation lounge-parlor car. All the passenger equipment was styled by industrial designer Raymond Loewy.

Today, the U.S. passenger car market is erratic in production and is mostly handled by specialty manufacturers and foreign corporations. Competitors Budd, Pullman-Standard, Rohr Industries, and the St. Louis Car Company have all either left the market or gone out of business.

The manufacturing facility in Milton, Pennsylvania, was served by the Norfolk Southern Railway and was capable of manufacturing railcars and all related railcar components. The plant was capable of producing pressure vessels in sizes 18,000–61,000 gwc, including propane tanks, compressed gas storage, LPG storage, and all related components, including heads. The plant, covering 48 acres, provided 500,000 square feet of covered work area and seven miles of storage tracks. The plant ceased production in 2019. The Huntington, West Virginia, production site ceased production in late 2009, and was demolished in 2021.

<text>Eddie Timanus (born August 9, 1968) is a &quot;USA Today&quot; sportswriter and game show contestant who grew up in Reston, Virginia, then graduated from Wake Forest University. He has been blind since early childhood due to retinoblastoma. Timanus is best known for his five-game winning streak on the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and for being the first blind contestant to appear on the show.

==Early life==
Timanus was born on August 9, 1968, in St. Joseph, Missouri. At age three, Timanus had an operation to remove tumors from his eyes, leading to his blindness. Following his &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; success, Timanus related a story from his childhood that his mother Terri told him: &quot;I came home and said, &#x27;Turn on the lights.&#x27; And she said, &#x27;They&#x27;re on and you won&#x27;t see them.&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Well, OK&#x27; and went on.&quot;

Timanus&#x27; father, Chuck, was a play-by-play announcer. Eddie began attending sporting events with his father at age six, and Eddie started keeping statistics at age 11. Timanus graduated from Wake Forest University in 1990 with a degree in economics. The following year, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Eddie worked alongside Chuck as a statkeeper for American University&#x27;s basketball games, using pegboards and abaci, compiling statistical information for WINX-AM radio. Terri Timanus was also a &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; contestant, appearing in 1991 and losing her only game.

==&quot;Jeopardy!&quot;==
Timanus was a contestant on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;; his games aired in October 1999. He was the first blind contestant to compete on the show. There were a few changes made to accommodate Timanus: the first was that he received a card with the category names printed in Braille before each round, and a Braille keyboard to type out his name on the podium&#x27;s computer and his response and wager for Final Jeopardy!. There were also no video-based clues during his appearances. Also, beginning with his appearances, contestants started out the show already at their podiums, instead of the old practice of walking up to them as they were being introduced. (The practice became permanent starting in September 2000.) Timanus refused further accommodations.

Timanus won five consecutive games and then, in accordance with the rules in effect at that time, retired undefeated. His winnings totaled US$69,700 plus two new cars (Chevrolet Camaros in his case), and he was invited back for the 2000 Tournament of Champions in Atlanta, Georgia, reaching the semifinals and won $5,000 there. The story became a minor media sensation, with &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Nielsen ratings rising 15 percent for Timanus&#x27; fourth and fifth games. Host Alex Trebek received one of six Access Awards from the American Foundation for the Blind in 2001 for his role in accommodating Timanus.

Timanus was a contestant on the &quot;Jeopardy! Million Dollar Masters&quot; Tournament in New York City which aired in May 2002, but did not advance beyond the first round and took home $10,000.

Timanus also appeared in the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Ultimate Tournament of Champions on March 16, 2005, in a first-round game. He finished in second place, taking home $5,000. In addition to the Braille cards and computer keyboard provided on his earlier appearances, an audible tone that was in sync with the game board&#x27;s lights was added in order to give him an indication of when he could begin buzzing in to respond.

Timanus participated in the March 3, 2014, episode of the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Battle of the Decades tournament. While he had the most money going into Final Jeopardy! round in which every contestant answered incorrectly, Timanus lost by a margin of $200 finishing in second place behind Rachael Schwartz. As with his Ultimate Tournament of Champions appearance, Timanus was given Braille cards, a computer keyboard, and an audible buzz-in indicator.

==&quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;==
In 2000, Timanus acted as a lifeline on &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;. On November 26, 2004, he appeared again on &quot;Millionaire&quot;, this time as a contestant, and won $50,000 in prize money. When Timanus used the phone-a-friend lifeline, host Meredith Vieira would read the question and the four choices to the friend that he chose to call and would also remind him how much time was remaining on the 30 seconds used for that lifeline.

==Sportswriting==
Timanus is a staff sportswriter for &quot;USA Today&quot;. His articles appear frequently in the publication. In addition to general reporting, Timanus is responsible for compiling the weekly &quot;USA Today&quot; Coaches&#x27; Poll. He also writes the preview section for college football games.

==Personal life==
Timanus met his wife, Kelli, through a Yahoo! Groups discussion group on game shows; they have a son named Evan.

<doc id="1229229" wikidata="Q818781" url="?curid=1229229" title="Spice (album)">
<text>Spice is the debut studio album by English girl group the Spice Girls, released in Japan on 19 September 1996 and in the United Kingdom on 4 November 1996 by Virgin Records. The album was recorded between 1995 and 1996 at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London, and Strongroom Studios in Shoreditch, London, by producers Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard, and the production duo Absolute. &quot;Spice&quot; is a pop album that incorporates styles such as dance, R&amp;B and hip hop. It is considered to be the record that brought teen pop back, opening the doors for a wave of teen pop artists. Conceptually, the album centered on the idea of Girl Power, and the hype surrounding the group was compared to Beatlemania.

A worldwide commercial success, &quot;Spice&quot; topped the charts in more than 17 countries across the world, and was certified Multi-Platinum in 27 countries, Platinum in 14 countries and Gold in three countries, including 10-times Platinum in the United Kingdom and Canada, eight-times Platinum in Europe, and seven-times Platinum in the United States. It became the world&#x27;s top-selling album of 1997, selling 19 million copies in over a year. The album has sold a total of 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album in music history by a girl group and one of the best-selling albums of all time.

Four singles were released from the album. The lead single, &quot;Wannabe&quot;, reached number one in 37 countries, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time as of 2010 by selling over six million copies worldwide. The next two singles, &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; and &quot;2 Become 1&quot;, reached number one in 53 countries. &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; was released as the official Comic Relief single in the UK as a double A-side with &quot;Mama&quot; and both songs reached the top 20 in charts across Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In the band&#x27;s native UK, all four singles went to number one on the UK Singles Chart and, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the album spawned three top-five singles.

==Background==
In February 1994, Chris and Bob Herbert, who together with financer Chic Murphy traded under the business name of Heart Management, placed an advert in &quot;The Stage&quot; magazine, which asked the question: &quot;Are you street smart, extrovert, ambitious, and able to sing and dance?&quot;. The management received hundreds of replies, but eventually reduced their search down to a final group of five girls: Victoria Beckham, Mel B, Melanie C, Geri Halliwell and Michelle Stephenson. The new band was originally called Touch and moved to a house in Maidenhead. Emma Bunton was the last to join after Stephenson dropped out when her mother became ill.

The group felt insecure about the lack of contract and were frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalog of demos and dance routines, the group began touring management agencies.
They started to meet with producers, musicians and other business executives, among which were composer Tim Hawes, and writers Richard Stannard and Matthew Rowe. Hawes worked with the group and watched the evolution in their singing and writing abilities. Together they composed a song called &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot;, which served as the inspiration behind the change of the group&#x27;s name to &quot;Spice&quot;. Eventually the name was changed again to &quot;Spice Girls&quot; due to an American rapper using the name &quot;Spice&quot; at the time. On 3 March 1995, because of the group&#x27;s frustration at their management&#x27;s unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. The group stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices in order to ensure they kept full control of their own work.

==Recording and production==
The group were supposed to meet with producer Eliot Kennedy the week after they left their former managers, but the meeting was arranged by the Herberts weeks before their departure. But without access to Herbert&#x27;s address book, they knew nothing of Kennedy&#x27;s whereabouts other than he lived in Sheffield. Mel B and Halliwell drove to Sheffield the day after the departure from Heart Management and looked for the first phone book they came across; Eliot was the third Kennedy that they called. That evening they went to his house and persuaded him to work with them. The rest of the girls travelled to Sheffield the next day. Kennedy commented about the session: &quot;None of them played instruments, so I was left to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, &#x27;Look, I&#x27;ve got a chorus—check this out&#x27;. Then they were throwing lines at us. 10 minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process.&quot; Four tracks were composed in that session: &quot;Love Thing&quot;, &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, &quot;Step to Me&quot; (which was released later) and &quot;Strong Enough&quot;. In the following months the group continued to meet with producers, wrote new songs, prepared demos and searched for a new manager. They met again with the writers Stannard and Rowe. They had previously worked with the girls in January 1995 before their departure from Heart Management; that was the group&#x27;s first professional songwriting session, held at the Strongroom in Curtain Road, east London.
In the first session with Stannard and Rowe, they wrote &quot;Feed Your Love&quot;, a slow, soulful song which was eventually recorded and mastered for the album, but not released because it was considered too rude and racy for their target audience. Having completed that session, the girls wanted to write something more uptempo, so they started to write the song that would be the lead of the album, &quot;Wannabe&quot;, which was recorded in under an hour—mainly because they had already written parts of the songs beforehand. The next song they recorded was a slow ballad and the third track on and single from the album, &quot;2 Become 1&quot;. The song was inspired by the special relationship which had developed between Halliwell and Rowe during the session. &quot;Mama&quot; was written by the Spice Girls with songwriting partners Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard. In an interview about the writing process between the group and the duo, Rowe credits Mel B as the one who came up with the song&#x27;s concept. During the writing process, each member wrote a small verse in a different corner of the recording studio, while the chorus was finished around the piano with a guitar. Then, the producers added a gospel choir filled with the group&#x27;s harmonies at the end of the song. They also produced the album&#x27;s last track &quot;If U Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;. In May 1995, the group was introduced to Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins, the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute. Watkins commented about their first meeting, &quot;They played us a few tracks, which we didn&#x27;t particularly like. So we thought, this is OK. We can work with this.&quot; A songwriting session was booked within the next few days at Absolute&#x27;s studio located on Tagg&#x27;s Island near Chertsey, but the musical association between them did not seem to go well at the beginning. Wilson remembered, &quot;When they started to sing it was never quite right: from our point of view. It was very poptastic.&quot; Watkins recalled, &quot;After two sessions we phoned our managers and said &#x27;This just ain&#x27;t happening&#x27;.&quot; It was at this point that Watkins and Wilson heard &quot;Wannabe&quot; for the first time. When speaking about the song, Wilson said, &quot;We listened to it and we didn&#x27;t get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought is this going to work?&quot;.

The next session was the definite one; either they would continue to work with the group or break up their relationship. Wilson recalled, &quot;Every previous time we&#x27;d met up with the girls we had prepared a backing track. This time we had nothing.&quot; Watkins also said, &quot;They said they wanted to do something up and a bit of fun, so we just off the top of our heads started to come up with a full-on disco backing track, which became &#x27;Who Do You Think You Are&#x27;.&quot; Wilson said of the song, &quot;The thing is when they wrote it, they were also writing the dance routine, constructing the music video, all at the same time as writing the song. And that&#x27;s when the penny dropped.&quot; The girls went on to write &quot;Something Kinda Funny&quot;, &quot;Last Time Lover&quot;, &quot;Naked&quot;, &quot;Bumper to Bumper&quot;, &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, &quot;One of These Girls&quot;, and &quot;Baby Come Round&quot; with Watkins and Wilson, none of them singles, but all of them tracks which lent a touch of classy R&amp;B feel to the &quot;Spice&quot; album and singles. Absolute also produced all of these songs as well as the three tracks penned with Eliot Kennedy: &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; &quot;Love Thing&quot; and later &quot;Step to me&quot; giving the duo a guiding hand in six of the ten tracks that eventually ended up on &quot;Spice&quot;. The tracks that Absolute produced were recorded for the most part at Olympic Studios in Barnes. At this time in 1995, Auto-Tune had not yet come to market and most of the vocals were recorded with few adjustments made afterwards. Absolute told Simon Fuller about the group they had worked with and asked whether he would consider managing them. Fuller received a demo of &quot;Something Kinda Funny&quot;, one of the songs the group wrote with Absolute. He showed interest in the group, began a relationship and decided to sign them at 19 Management in March 1995. In September 1995 the group signed a deal with Virgin Records, and continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while touring the west coast of the United States, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific in November.

The Spice Girls were fully involved in the writing of all the songs. Halliwell in particular was clearly a fund of ideas for songs, arriving at sessions with her book of jottings, notes and miscellaneous scribblings which often produced the starting point of a lyric or a song title or just an agenda for the day&#x27;s work. Watkins commented, &quot;Geri [Halliwell] would come up with the concept for a song. Typically, she&#x27;d sing one line and the girls would pick up on it or we&#x27;d pick up on it and construct around it and then [Melanie C] and Emma [Bunton] would be very active. They&#x27;d really like to sit and sing melodies and go off and come up with little sections.&quot; They &quot;conceptualised&quot; and sang bits of melody and wrote the lyrics. But in musical terms it was not a partnership of equals. Rowe commented: &quot;We had to kind of steer it. It was very different for different tracks really. Some of them were when we were all jamming in the room. We&#x27;d just put up some drum sounds and start making things up. On other tracks me and Richard [Stannard] would prepare something beforehand and play it to them. We&#x27;d have some lyrics and make them write the second verse.&quot; The Spice Girls introduced two key innovations that have had a lasting impact on the way which modern pop acts go about their creative business. Firstly they introduced the idea of songwriting identity. This was a familiar concept in rock bands like Queen or the Sex Pistols, but not in the world of &quot;manufactured pop&quot;, where the credits of songwriting would be divided out strictly in accordance with whoever had written the song. The Spice Girls recognised their solidarity as a group, which depended on maintaining parity in all departments, including the songwriting credits and the resulting royalties. They share the songwriting royalties on all the songs irrespective of what any member of the group had or had not contributed to any particular song. The second thing the Spice Girls established from the outset was a straight 50–50 split between them and their various songwriting collaborators. Here they anticipated one of the key developments in the pop industry since the 1990s, namely the increasing importance of publishing royalties as opposed to royalties payments made for the performance of the song on the record.

In an interview with Apple Music for the Spice25 release, Melanie C divulged, &quot;We had [a] risqué song called &#x27;C U Next Tuesday&#x27;, which was vetoed for the 25th anniversary edition, but I do have plans for it. It sounds like a Lily Allen song; it&#x27;s absolutely brilliant.&quot;

==Composition==

===Lyrical content===
&quot;Wannabe&quot;, the most emblematic song of the Girl Power philosophy, was chosen as the first track and lead single of the album. It highlights the slogans the group tend to cite like the union and solidarity between friends and the power exercised by women over men. The second single &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; described the things the group had been through together and how they had always been there for each other. It received mixed reviews; some critics praised it as a catchy song, while others dubbed it as merely a bid for credibility, while others described the lyrics as &quot;confusing&quot;. The third single &quot;2 Become 1&quot; focused upon the bonding of lovers, and how the bond can become so strong that they practically become one entity, through the act of sex; in addition, the lyrics address the importance of contraception.
&quot;Love Thing&quot; is the fourth track; it focuses on relationships and how after many disappointments the girls do not want to know anything about love. The song symbolizes the Girl Power philosophy by showing the support between each other and finding the strength to continue. The fifth track, &quot;Last Time Lover&quot;, was originally called &quot;First Time Lover&quot; and was about the loss of virginity, but was discarded and changed to a song full of provocations, where sex is the main issue. The sixth track, &quot;Mama&quot;, was dedicated to the group&#x27;s mothers, and deals with the difficulties in the relationships between mothers and teenagers that appear during adolescence. Reviewers described the ballad as &quot;glossy&quot; and &quot;corny&quot;.

The seventh track, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;, is about the presumptuous superstar life and how someone can get trapped in the world of fame. The inspiration for this song came from some of the people the group met in the music industry. It was well received by critics, who thought that the song was one of the group&#x27;s &quot;strongest and underrated songs&quot; and that it &quot;still feels relevant today&quot;. &quot;Something Kinda Funny&quot;, the eighth track of the album, is about the &quot;fun&quot; the group experienced together, and how it was fate that they came to know each other. The ninth track, &quot;Naked&quot; deals with vulnerability and the step from girls to women and how this process made the group stronger, something they were experiencing at that moment. It received mixed reviews from critics; some described it as &quot;soulful and funky as anything by TLC or Brand New Heavies&quot;, while others considered the song as a &quot;bit of a let down&quot;. The last track of the album, &quot;If U Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;, deals with preconceived ideas about people and how sometimes they are totally different from what they appear.

===Style and themes===
&quot;Spice&quot; is a pop album with a diverse inclusion of musical styles such as dance, R&amp;B, hip hop, soul, rap and funk, which lead some reviewers to call it a pop collection. The lead single, &quot;Wannabe&quot; is an uptempo pop song with elements of white hip–hop, rap and dance music. Two of the three ballads of the album, &quot;2 Become 1&quot; and &quot;Mama&quot;, were co–written and produced by Stannard and Rowe, and both feature the use of keyboards, guitars, string arrangements and backing vocals.

Production duo Absolute incorporated a mix of dance-pop, funk and R&amp;B on &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, which includes a harmonica solo played by Judd Lander, who also played the harmonica on Culture Club&#x27;s &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot;. The other songs produced by Absolute feature different music genres: &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Something Kinda Funny&quot; include pop elements with influences of soul music and funk, respectively. &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; is influenced by early-1990s Europop, and incorporates a disco-style beat that resembles the music of the late 1970s. &quot;If U Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;, another heavily dance–oriented song, features a rap section performed by Halliwell in Spanish and contains a sample of Digital Underground&#x27;s song &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot;.

The main concept of the album centred on the idea of Girl Power, embodying a feminist image, as both Madonna and Bananarama had employed before. Every track of the album deals with different aspects of this notion: the lead single &quot;Wannabe&quot; makes demands of sincerity and is a feminist message of choosing friends over relationships; &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; motivates girls to stand up for themselves as individuals, while the focus of &quot;Love Thing&quot; is the symbolic expression of unity as a group; &quot;Something Kinda Funny&quot; deals with the identification of goals in life and &quot;Last Time Lover&quot; encourages the use of sexual charm as a weapon to be deployed along with any other skills that would help to get a result.

==Singles==

Released as the group&#x27;s debut single in July 1996, &quot;Wannabe&quot; topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks and received a Platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In January 1997 it was released in the United States, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for four weeks. It was the group&#x27;s only number-one single in that country. By the end of 1996, &quot;Wannabe&quot; had topped the charts in 22 nations, and by March 1997 this number had climbed to 31. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, who called it &quot;a melodious but disposable tune that typifies this debut&#x27;s tart bubblegum and packaged sexiness&quot; and found the track as &quot;more a compendium of music styles than an actual song&quot;, it became the best-selling single by a female group, selling over six million copies worldwide.

&quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on 14 October 1996. It became the group&#x27;s second number-one single in the United Kingdom, and was certified Platinum by the BPI. It was a commercial success across Europe, reaching the top 10 in most of the charts that it entered. As a result of its popularity, the song was released in 1997 in Australia, receiving a Gold certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and in North America, entering the top five in Canada and peaking at number three in the United States.

&quot;2 Become 1&quot; was released as the group&#x27;s third single on 16 December 1996. It was generally well-received by music critics and was a commercial success. It topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks, becoming the group&#x27;s third consecutive chart-topper, their second million-selling single, and their first Christmas number-one single in the United Kingdom. In July 1997, the song was released in the United States, peaking at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and receiving a Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It performed similarly internationally, peaking inside the top 10 on the majority of the charts that it entered.

&quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; was released as a double A-side single in March 1997 as the group&#x27;s fourth single. It became the group&#x27;s fourth consecutive number-one single in the United Kingdom, making them the first act in UK chart history to have its first four singles reach number one. Additionally, it was certified Platinum by the BPI, and performed well internationally, reaching the top 10 in many European countries and New Zealand, and the top 20 in Australia, France, and Norway.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Spice&quot; received mixed reviews from pop music critics. In &quot;NME&quot;, Mark Sutherland praised the album as &quot;a consummate state-of-the-art pop record, as good as the mainstream ever gets&quot;, with &quot;some of if not the best pop music of the year.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine deemed it &quot;immaculately crafted pop&quot; that is &quot;infectious&quot; and &quot;irresistible&quot;, adding that &quot;&quot;Spice&quot; doesn&#x27;t need to be original to be entertaining&quot; and that &quot;none of the girls have great voices, but they do exude personality and charisma&quot;. Ken Tucker from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the album &quot;a devilishly good pop collection&quot;, and Lois Alter Mark from the same magazine described the Spice Girls as &quot;Go-Go&#x27;s with attitude&quot;, while also noting that &quot;with their brash attitudes and rude behavior, the girls may not be ideal role models&quot; for children.

LAUNCHcast&#x27;s Dev Sherlock called &quot;Spice&quot; &quot;pure upbeat ear candy&quot; and said that it was &quot;one of the most fun and exciting pop releases of the year&quot;, finding that the Spice Girls&#x27; Girl Power philosophy is &quot;a well-balanced manifesto for young women everywhere that is neither twee nor riot grrrl-angry.&quot; In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Caroline Sullivan wrote that despite the album&#x27;s &quot;unbelievably slick&quot; and commercial sound, &quot;all those Girl Power declarations aren&#x27;t just empty slogans, one feels.&quot; Other critics were less receptive. Sara Scribner of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; found the group&#x27;s music and image &quot;shamelessly one-dimensional&quot;, while Christina Kelly from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; dismissed them as another &quot;bubblegum-pop&quot; group who &quot;offer a watered-down mix of hip-hop and cheesy pop balladry&quot;, stating that &quot;despite their pro-woman posing, the Girls don&#x27;t get bogged down by anything deeper than mugging for promo shots and giving out tips on getting boys in bed.&quot;

&quot;Spice&quot; was nominated for the 1997 Mercury Prize. However, it lost to &quot;New Forms&quot; by Roni Size &amp; Reprazent. Reflecting on the album in 2019, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Aimee Cliff opined that despite its somewhat &quot;flimsy&quot; feminism, &quot;&quot;Spice&quot; remains an audacious achievement... it snuck five Girls who were not on the guest list inside the establishment, causing chaos for a brief, surreal moment.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The commercial success of &quot;Spice&quot; was unprecedented and drew comparisons to Beatlemania (it was dubbed &quot;Spicemania&quot;) due to the sheer volume of interest in the group. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with first-sales of 114,000 copies, spending 15 non-consecutive weeks atop the chart. The album was certified 10-times Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 1 August 1997, and as of November 2021, it had sold 3,022,090 copies in the United Kingdom. In Europe, the album became the biggest-selling album of 1997 and was certified eight-times Platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for sales in excess of eight million copies. The album reached number one in France and was certified Diamond by the Syndicat National de l&#x27;Édition Phonographique (SNEP), triple Gold in Germany by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI), and 10-times Platinum in Spain for one million copies sold. The album also made a huge impact in Asian countries, selling two million copies in Japan and Southeast Asia by 1997, peaking at number seven in Japan and certified four-times Platinum, with sales of 718,432 copies by March 1997.

In the United States, &quot;Spice&quot; debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, eventually reaching number one for five weeks and selling 1.46 million in its first 12 weeks of release. It became the biggest-selling album of 1997, with 5,302,000 million copies sold by the end of the year. On 19 May 1999, the album was certified seven-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and as of May 2017, it had sold 7.5 million copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In Canada, the album topped the Canadian Albums Chart. It was certified 10-times Platinum (Diamond) by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for shipments of one million copies. The album sold 10 million copies worldwide in its first seven months. In total, &quot;Spice&quot; has sold 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the biggest-selling album by a girl group in music history and one of the most successful albums of all time.

Following the Spice World Tour announcement, &quot;Spice&quot; re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number 94 on 16 November 2018 and at number 84 on 16 June 2019.

==&quot;Spice25&quot;==
To mark the 25th anniversary of &quot;Wannabe&quot;, an EP of the group&#x27;s debut single was released in July 2021 that included previously unreleased demos.

On 1 September 2021, the Spice Girls announced the re-release of &quot;Spice&quot; to mark the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary, titled &quot;Spice25&quot;. The deluxe double album was released on 29 October 2021 and contains remixes, demos and unreleased tracks. Also, the single version of &quot;2 Become 1&quot; was included as the third track on the album, instead of the original album version. The CDs come in an A5 hardback booklet, with a collection of iconic images and a set of six Spice Girls postcards, while the original album is also available on limited edition vinyl and cassette.

The &quot;Spice25&quot; reissue saw the album re-enter the UK Albums Chart at number five with 7,798 copies sold, while reaching number three on the Official Vinyl Albums Chart and number four on the Official Physical Albums Chart.

<doc id="1229233" wikidata="Q559562" url="?curid=1229233" title="Child neglect">
<text>Child neglect is an act of caregivers (e.g., parents) that results in depriving a child of their basic needs, such as the failure to provide adequate supervision, health care, clothing, or housing, as well as other physical, emotional, social, educational, and safety needs. All societies have established that there are necessary behaviours a caregiver must provide for a child to develop physically, socially, and emotionally. Causes of neglect may result from several parenting problems including mental disorders, unplanned pregnancy, substance use disorder, unemployment, over employment, domestic violence, and, in special cases, poverty.

Child neglect depends on how a child and society perceive the caregiver&#x27;s behaviour; it is not how parents believe they are behaving toward their child. Parental failure to provide for a child, when options are available, is different from failure to provide when options are not available. Poverty and lack of resources are often contributing factors and can prevent parents from meeting their children&#x27;s needs when they otherwise would. The circumstances and intentionality must be examined before defining behaviour as neglectful.

Child neglect is the most prevalent form of child abuse, with children born to young mothers at substantial risk for neglect. Neglected children are at risk of developing lifelong social, emotional and health problems, particularly if neglected before the age of two years.

==Definition==
Neglect is difficult to define since there are no clear, cross-cultural standards for desirable or minimally adequate child-rearing practices. Research shows that neglect often coexists with other forms of abuse and adversity. While neglect generally refers to the absence of parental care and the chronic failure to meet children&#x27;s basic needs, defining those needs has not been straightforward. In &quot;Working Together&quot;, the Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom) defined neglect in 2006 as:

...the persistent failure to meet a child&#x27;s basic physical and/or psychological needs, likely to result in the serious impairment of the child&#x27;s health or development. Neglect may occur during pregnancy as a result of maternal substance use disorders. Once a child is born, neglect may involve a parent or carer failing to provide adequate food, clothing and shelter (including exclusion from home or abandonment); protect a child from physical and emotional harm or danger; ensure adequate supervision (including the use of inadequate care-givers), or ensure access to appropriate medical care or treatment. It may also include neglect of, or unresponsiveness to, a child&#x27;s basic emotional needs.

Child neglect is commonly defined as a failure by a child&#x27;s caregiver to meet a child&#x27;s physical, emotional, educational, or medical needs. Forms of child neglect include: Allowing the child to witness violence or severe abuse between parents or adults, ignoring, insulting, or threatening the child with violence, not providing the child with a safe environment and adult emotional support, and showing reckless disregard for the child&#x27;s well-being.

Other definitions of child neglect are: 
*&quot;The failure of a person responsible for a child&#x27;s care and upbringing to safeguard the child&#x27;s emotional and physical health and general well-being.&quot; per Webster&#x27;s New World Law Dictionary
*&quot;Acts of omission: failure to provide for a child&#x27;s basic physical, emotional, or educational needs or to protect a child from harm or potential harm. [...] harm to a child may or may not be the intended consequence. Failure to provide [results in] physical neglect, emotional neglect, medical/dental neglect, and educational neglect. The failure to supervise [results in] inadequate supervision, exposure to violent environments.&quot; per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
*&quot;The persistent failure to meet a child&#x27;s basic physical and/or psychological needs resulting in serious impairment of health and/or development.&quot;

The definition of child neglect is broad. There are no specific guidelines that determine when a child is being neglected; therefore, it is up to state government agencies and professional groups to determine what is considered neglect. In general, child neglect is considered the failure of parents or caregivers to meet the needs that are necessary for the mental, physical, and emotional development of a child.

Child neglect is one of the most common forms of child maltreatment, and it continues to be a serious problem for many children. Child neglect tremendously affects the physical development, mental development, and emotional development of a child causing long-term consequences, such as poor academic achievement, depression (mood), and personality disorders. These consequences also impact society, since it is more likely that children who suffered from child neglect will have substance use disorder problems and educational failure when they grow up.

==Types==
There are various types of child neglect. 

*Physical neglect refers to the failure to provide a child with necessities of life, such as food and clothing.
*Medical neglect is a failure of caregivers to meet a child&#x27;s basic health care needs, such as not brushing teeth daily, bathing a child and or taking children to doctor visits when needed.
*Emotional neglect is failing to provide emotional support, such as emotional security and encouragement.
*Educational/developmental neglect is the failure to provide a child with experiences for necessary growth and development, such as not sending a child to school or educating them.
*Depending on the laws and child protection policies in one&#x27;s area, leaving a young child unsupervised may be considered neglect, especially if doing so places the child in danger.

Child neglect can also be described by degrees of severity and the responses considered warranted by communities and government agencies.
*Mild neglect is the least likely to be perceived as neglect by the child but raises the possibility of harm in ways that need intervention by the community. An example might be a parent who does not use a proper car safety seat.
*Moderate neglect occurs when some harm to the child has occurred. An example might be a child repeatedly dressed inappropriately for the weather (e.g. shorts in winter.) In cases of moderate harm, governmental agencies might be called in to assist parents.
*Severe neglect occurs over time and results in significant harm to the child. An example might be a child with asthma being denied treatment.

==Experience==
Children may be left at home alone, which can result in negative consequences. Being left at home alone can leave young people feeling scared, vulnerable and not knowing when their parents are going to return. The frequency and duration of being left at home alone may range from every evening to several days or even weeks at a time.

Also, young children may not be provided with a suitable amount of decent food to eat, which is another form of neglect. Children have reported being provided with mouldy food, not having any food in the house, or they were given an insufficient amount of food.

==Causes==
The causes of child neglect are complex and can be attributed to three different levels: an intrapersonal, an inter-personal/family, and a social/economic level. Although the causes of neglect are varied, studies suggest that, amongst other things, parental mental health problems, substance use, domestic violence, unemployment, and poverty are factors which increase the likelihood of neglect. Children that result from unintended pregnancies are more likely to suffer from abuse and neglect. They are also more likely to live in poverty. Neglectful families often experience a variety or a combination of adverse factors.

At the intra-personal level, the discussion around neglectful parents&#x27; characteristics often focuses on mothers, reflecting traditional notions of women as primary caregivers for children. &quot;Neglectful attributes&quot; have included an inability to plan, lack of confidence about the future, difficulty with managing money, emotional immaturity, lack of knowledge of children&#x27;s needs, a large number of children, being a teenage mother, high levels of stress and poor socioeconomic circumstances. Mental health problems, particularly depression, have been linked with a parent&#x27;s inability to meet a child&#x27;s needs. Likewise, substance misuse is believed to play a crucial role in undermining a parent&#x27;s ability to cope with parental responsibilities. Recent empirical works have also pointed to parental burnout (i.e., chronic lack of parenting resources) as an especially potent mechanism in driving neglectful behaviour toward children. While the literature largely focuses on mothers, the role of fathers in neglect, as well as the impact of their absence, remains largely unexplored. There is still little known about whether mothers and fathers neglect differently and how this affects children. Similarly, not much is known about whether girls and boys experience neglect differently.

===Interpersonal/family===
At the interpersonal/family level, a significant number of neglectful families are headed by a lone mother or have a transient male. Unstable and abusive relationships have also been mentioned as increasing the risk of child neglect. The impact of living with domestic violence on children frequently includes either direct violence or forced witnessing of abuse, which is potentially very damaging to children. While the UK Department of Health connects children&#x27;s exposure to domestic violence to parents&#x27; failure to protect them from emotional harm, the notion of &quot;failure to protect&quot; has been challenged as it focuses primarily on the responsibility of the abused parent, usually the mother, who is often herself at significant risk. A recent reform to the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act (2004) has introduced a new offence of causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable adult, thus reinforcing the notion of &quot;failure to protect&quot;. Research on domestic violence, however, has consistently shown that supporting the non-abusive parent is good for child protection. There is some indication of the cyclical and inter-generational nature of neglect. A study on childhood abuse and the mother&#x27;s later ability to be sensitive to a child&#x27;s emotions showed that mothers with a self-reported history of physical abuse had higher indications of insensitivity and lack of attunement to infants&#x27; emotional cues than mothers with no history of abuse. Although the literature suggests that neglectful parents may have been affected adversely by their own past experiences, more research is needed to explore the link between past experiences of maltreatment and neglectful parenting behaviours. Alcohol and drug abuse in caregivers are important risk factors for recurrent child maltreatment after accounting for other known risk factors; the increased risk appears to be similar between alcohol and drug abuse.

===Socioeconomic===
At the social and economic level, the association between poverty and neglect has frequently been made. A study of the maltreatment of children by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children supports the association between neglect and lower socio-economic class. US studies have shown that less affluent families are more likely to be found to maltreat their children, particularly in the form of neglect and physical abuse, than affluent families. Some argue that many forms of physical neglect, such as inadequate clothing, exposure to environmental hazards and poor hygiene may be directly attributed to poverty whereas others are more cautious in making a direct link. Studies have shown that parents in a low socioeconomic level are less likely to purchase resources needed for their children, which makes them experience school failure at a more frequent level. While poverty is believed to increase the likelihood of neglect, poverty does not predetermine neglect. Many low-income families are not neglectful and provide loving homes for their children. However, when poverty coexists with other forms of adversity, it can negatively impact a parent&#x27;s ability to cope with stressors and undermine their capacity to adequately respond to their child&#x27;s needs. It can also mean that parents who want to work are faced with the choice between being unemployed and leaving their children at home. McSherry argues that the relationship between child neglect and poverty should be seen as circular and interdependent. Where caregiver alcohol abuse is identified, children are significantly more likely to experience multiple incidents of neglect compared with children where this is not identified, as were children where other family risk factors (including markers of socioeconomic disadvantage) are found.

==Parenting styles==
The patterns of repetitive behaviour point out that a cycle of violence repeats. Research on the correlation between child neglect and parenting styles has shown that those who suffered from parental neglect tend to have problems in relationships as adults. Attachment style of children of abusive parents was less secure compared to children with authoritative caregivers. Children who suffered from physical and emotional abuse are more likely to have an insecure attachment, such as being preoccupied, dismissive, or fearful. Three parenting styles lead to child neglect: authoritarian, permissive, and disengaged styles.

==Taboo==

There is some evidence to suggest that there is a cultural taboo around acknowledging child neglect in one&#x27;s own family. In one research study parents who accessed a service focused on families where child neglect is a concern never mentioned the word &#x27;neglect&#x27; during interviews designed to find out about their experience of the service. In an analysis of NSPCC Childline data, John Cameron, the Head of Helplines reported that many of the neglected children who contacted the line did not use the word neglect and did not indicate that they were being neglected when they first spoke to a member of Childline.

==Effects==
Effects of child neglect can differ depending on the individual and how much treatment is provided, but generally speaking child neglect that occurs in the first two years of a child&#x27;s life may be more of an important precursor of childhood aggression compared to later neglect, which may not have as strong a correlation. Maltreatment in children leads to compromises in the development of cognitive, language, socioemotional, and neurobiological domains. Children who suffer from neglect most often also have attachment difficulties, cognitive deficits, emotional/behavioural problems, and physical consequences as a result of neglect. Early neglect has the potential to modify the body&#x27;s stress response, specifically cortisol levels (stress hormones) which can cause abnormalities and alter the body&#x27;s overall health. Research has shown that there is a relationship between neglect and disturbing patterns of infant-caretaker attachment. If parents lack sensitivity to their baby&#x27;s needs, the baby may develop insecure-anxious attachment. The neglectful behaviour the child experiences will contribute to their attachment difficulties and formation of relationships in the future, or lack thereof. In addition to biological and social effects, neglect affects the intellectual ability and cognitive/academic deficits. Children who suffer from child neglect may also suffer from anxiety or impulse-control disorders. Another result of child neglect is what people call &quot;failure to thrive&quot;. Infants who have deficits in growth and abnormal behaviours such as withdrawal, apathy and excessive sleep are failing to thrive, rather than developing to become &quot;healthy&quot; individuals.

A study by Robert Wilson, a professor at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, and his colleagues, showed for the first time that children under the age of 18 when were moderately neglected in some manner by their caregivers had a 3 times likely risk of stroke over those with moderately low levels, after controlling for some common risk factors (they interviewed 1,040 participants ages 55 or older; after years, 257 of them died and 192 were autopsied, with 89 having stroke evidence upon autopsy and another 40 had a history of it). Neglect, bullying, and abuse have previously been linked to changes in the brain&#x27;s grey matter and white matter and to accelerated ageing.

==Statistics==
In terms of who is reported for neglectful behaviour, it is most often women. The higher proportion of females reported for neglect may reflect the social attitude that mothers are responsible for meeting the needs of their children. In recent years, latent issues for child development and for the culture and political economy that are associated with paternal neglect have received more attention, however. Neglecting parents interact less with their children, engage in less verbal instruction and play behaviour, show less affection and are involved in more negative interactions with their children, for example, verbal aggression. Often parents who neglect their children are single parents or disabled mothers who already have to care for themselves, and therefore the child is an additional stress. This additional stress is often neglected. Family size can contribute to child neglect. If a family has several children, they may not be able to give all the children all the necessities needed to survive and thrive. Unfortunately, if the family cannot provide for all their children, children can suffer neglect. Family history can play a role in parents&#x27; neglectful behaviour. If parents were neglected as children meaning they learned neglectful behaviour from their parents, they often internalize and believe those behaviours to be the &quot;norm&quot;, which results in neglecting their children. In one study done in 2011, results showed that one in four mothers were neglectful, and neglect was four times as likely with a maternal history of physical abuse in childhood than with no history of maltreatment. Neglect is by far the most common type of child abuse reported in the U.S., and in 2016, it accounted for nearly 65 per cent of child abuse cases.

==Disclosure==
Research suggests that most neglected children, even when they can talk to a professional about their circumstances, do not use the word &#x27;neglect&#x27; and may not even indicate that they are being neglected. It is therefore recommended that professionals are proactive in exploring for and identifying neglect.

When neglect is disclosed, action is not always taken. Equally, when professionals pass concerns about neglect on to other professionals in the workplace they find those professionals do not always respond. The NSPCC recently reported on the case of a teaching assistant, who contacted the organization with concerns about a particular child. The teaching assistant asked to remain anonymous, fearing that she would be sacked by her school if they were to find out that she&#x27;d made the disclosure.

==Assessing and identifying==
Assessing and identifying neglect pose several challenges for practitioners. 

Selecting the right method to identify neglect can be helped by having a clear conceptualization of neglect. Neglect is a process whereby a child experiences developmental delay owing to the fact of not having received sufficient levels of any combination of care, stimulation or nutrition, which collectively can be referred to as nurturance. Given that neglect is a dynamic between the child&#x27;s development and levels of nurturance, the question in identifying neglect, becomes one of where does one start, with the child&#x27;s development or with the levels of nurturance?

===Development-focused methods===
Some professionals identify neglect by measuring the developmental levels of a child, for if those developmental levels are normal, one can, by definition, conclude that a child is not being neglected. Areas of development that could be measured include weight, height, stamina, social and emotional responses, and speech and motor development. All these features go up to make a medical assessment of whether a child is thriving, so that a professional looking to start an assessment of neglect, might reasonably start with information collected by a doctor. Infants are often weighed and measured when seen by their physicians for well-baby check-ups. The physician initiates a more complete evaluation when the infant&#x27;s development and functioning are found to be delayed. What this suggests is that social work staff could consult medical notes to establish if the baby or child is failing to thrive, as the first step in a pathway towards identifying neglect. If developmental levels are subnormal, then the identification of neglect requires the professional to establish if those subnormal levels of development can be put down to the level of nurturance experienced by the child. One needs to discount that the developmental delay was caused by some genetic condition or disease. These development-focused methods used for detecting child neglect and abuse are among the most effective we have to date, are useful tools for professionals to quickly recognize and easily detect when something is amiss in regards to the care of a child. 

===Starting the assessment by examining the nurturance received by the child===
Another way of beginning the process of identifying neglect is to identify if the child in question is experiencing a level of nurturance lower than that considered necessary to support normal development. In part, this requires a knowledge of the level of nurturance required by the child to sustain normal development, which might be particular to his or her age, gender and other factors. However, quite how one ascertains what a particular child needs, without referring back to their level of development, is not something theory and policy on neglect is clear about. Furthermore, ascertaining whether a child is getting the requisite level of nurturance needs to take into account not just the intensity of the nurturance, but also, given that the intensity of certain forms of nurturance can carry across time, the duration and frequency of the nurturance. It is OK for a child to experience varying and low levels of certain types of nurturance across a day and from time to time, however, it is not OK if the levels of nurturance never cross thresholds of intensity, duration and frequency. For this reason, professionals are minded to keep detailed histories of care provision, which demonstrate the duration to which the child is exposed to periods of subnormal exposure to care, stimulation and nutrition.

===Starting the assessment by examining the nurturance provided by the carer or parent===
Professionals should focus on the levels of nurturance provided by the carers of the child, where neglect is understood as an issue of the parent&#x27;s behaviour. Some authors feel that establishing the failure of parents and caregivers to provide care would be sufficient to conclude that neglect was occurring. Action for Children states that &quot;A child experiences neglect when the adults who look after them fail to meet their needs&quot; clearly defining neglect as a matter of parental performance. This raises the question about what level of nurturance, a carer or parent needs to fall under, to provoke developmental delay, and how one goes about measuring that accurately.

The method, which focuses on the stimulation provided by the carer, can be subject to critique. Neglect is about the child&#x27;s development being adversely affected by the levels of nurturance, but the carers&#x27; provision of nurturance is not always a good indicator of the level of nurturance received by the child. Neglect may be occurring at school, outside of parental care. The child may be receiving nurturance from siblings or through a boarding school education, which compensates for the lack of nurturance provided by the parents.

===Linking development to stimulation===
Neglect is a process whereby children experience developmental delay owing to experiencing insufficient levels of nurturance. It has been argued that in principle, this means that when starting an assessment of neglect by identifying developmental delay one needs to then check the levels of nurturance received by the child. Certainly, where guidance on identifying neglect does urge practitioners to measure developmental levels, some guidance urges practitioners to focus on how developmental levels can be attributed to parental behaviour. However the narrow focus on parental behaviour can be criticised for unnecessarily ruling out the possible impact of institutionalised neglect, e.g. neglect at school.

If one starts by concluding that the levels of nurturance received by the child are insufficient, one then needs to consider the developmental levels achieved by the child.

Further challenges arise, however. Even when one has established developmental delay and exposure to low levels of nurturance, one needs to rule out the possibility that the link between the two is coincidental. The developmental delay may be caused by a genetic disorder, disease or physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Of course, the developmental delay may be caused by a mixture of underexposure to nurturance, abuse, genetics and disease.

===Practical tools for measuring===
The Graded Care Profile Tool is a practice tool which gives an objective measure of the quality of care in terms of a parent/carer&#x27;s commitment. It was developed in the UK.

The North Carolina Family Assessment Scale is a tool which can be used by a practitioner to explore whether neglect is taking place across a range of family functioning areas. The NSPCC makes use of the NCFAS in their Evidence Based Decision-making Practice Model, which involves a Society practitioner working alongside the local authorities assigned a social worker to review the functioning of the family in complex neglect cases.

==Intervention programs==
Early intervention programs and treatments in developed countries include individual counselling, family, group counselling and social support services, and behavioural skills training programs to eliminate problematic behaviour and teach parents &quot;appropriate&quot; parenting behaviour.

===Parenting programmes===
====Video Interaction Guidance====
Video interaction guidance is a video feedback intervention through which a &quot;guider&quot; helps a client to enhance communication within relationships. The client is guided to analyse and reflect on video clips of their interactions. Video Interaction Guidance has been used where concerns have been expressed over possible parental neglect in cases where the focus child is aged 2–12, and where the child is not the subject of a child protection plan.

====SafeCare====
The SafeCare programme is a preventative programme working with parents of children under 6 years old who are at risk of experiencing significant harm through neglect. The programme is delivered in the home by trained practitioners, over 18 to 20 sessions and focuses on 3 key areas: parent-infant/child interaction; home safety and child health.

====Triple P====
Triple P is a positive parenting program. It is a multilevel, parenting and family support strategy. The idea behind it is that if parents are educated on &quot;proper&quot; parenting and given the appropriate resources, it could help decrease the number of child neglect cases. When deciding whether to leave a child home alone, caregivers need to consider the child&#x27;s physical, mental, and emotional well-being, as well as state laws and policies regarding this issue.

==Effectiveness of intervention programs==
Evidence for the effectiveness of intervention programs can be divided into two types. One type is impact studies where the evaluation aims to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in outcomes on a population, which can be attributed to the intervention. A second type is qualitative studies which aim to illuminate the mechanisms through which program participants can access the resources and help offered in the program to achieve better outcomes.

===Impact studies===
Several interventions aimed at families where child neglect is occurring have been subject to an impact study.

====Video interaction guidance====
Video Interaction Guidance has been used where concerns have been expressed over possible parental neglect in cases where the focus child is aged 2–12, and where the child is not the subject of a child protection plan. An evaluation of the project demonstrated that VIG produced a significant change in the emotional and behavioural difficulties of the population of children who received the service, and improvement in the reported level of parenting and reported parental relationship with their children in the population of parents whose children received the service. The data excludes parents who failed to complete the programme, parents who completed the programme but decided not to complete evaluation measures, and on some measures parents who completed measures but whose feedback was adjudged to have been positively biased.

====SafeCare====
The SafeCare programme has been provided to families in the United Kingdom where a professional has judged there is a risk of experiencing significant harm through neglect. Outcome data shows that on average families who participated in the evaluation of the programme improved parenting skills and reduced neglectful behaviours. Furthermore, all referrers reported seeing positive changes in the families they referred, particularly in home safety, parent-child interaction and health. However, in the absence of a comparison group it was not possible to attribute the changes to SafeCare.

====Triple P====
Triple P has also been provided to families in the United Kingdom where neglect is a concern. The findings from this service showed that on average the children who participated in the evaluation experienced improved emotional and behavioural outcomes. However, this positive change could not be attributed to Triple P because a control group had not been established.

===Mechanisms to stop neglect===
Qualitative research studies have also illuminated some of how programs can help individual parents.

====Social learning theory====
Evaluations have demonstrated that in certain cases parents have learned to improve their parenting in the way described by social learning theory. Social Learning Theory suggests people learn by observing behaviours and the positive outcomes associated with them. An evaluation of the Triple P intervention highlighted how many parents were able to improve how they related to their children after having received advice about how to be clear with their children, and in some cases after having tried and seen the effects of such approaches for themselves, first-hand, and often for the first time. Prompted by Video Interaction Guidance, parents–with several children, who traditionally spent time with each of them all together in a group–started spending one-to-one time with their children, oftentimes for the very first time. Some parents also started to do activities with their children, which involved a small element of risk, after having agreed to do them for the first time as part of Video Interaction Guidance.

====Relationship between practitioner and parent====
A common finding across evaluations of programmes designed to help families where neglect is a concern is that the principal factor which influences parents&#x27; engagement and perception is the quality of the relationship that they can build with the practitioner delivering the programme. Key factors in helping practitioners engage parents in the intervention include:
*Establishing a sense that the practitioner will support the family beyond what is necessary to complete the intervention.
*Giving family members time to talk about their problems both during and outside of appointments.
*Advocating for the family on issues with which the intervention is not directly concerned.
*Ensuring that fun forms a part of the interaction.
*Making family members feel cared for through the provision of clothes, food and gifts.
*Giving parents a lead in analysing family functioning and parenting.
*Carrying out the intervention in the home of the parent.
*Practitioners working on weekday evenings.
In the case of Video Interaction Guidance, when parents were asked about their experience of the intervention, parents invariably referred to the care and support provided by the practitioner. Effectively the intervention is experienced as an aspect of the overall relationship of care.

==Children&#x27;s responses==
There are a variety of ways in which children can act in response to an experience of neglect.
*Some children attempt to talk about the neglect of their parents. In some cases, the parents may respond aggressively or abusively to such attempts to resolve the issue.
*Some children steal money from their parents&#x27; purses to feed themselves.
*Babies are too young to ameliorate parental neglect, however in some cases siblings will step in and take care of them. Some older siblings go without food so that their younger siblings can eat.
*Some children will attempt to flee from their homes. If the child was hungry, they will go to their homes or find the food from a dumpster/ a place that can get free food.

<doc id="1229248" wikidata="Q4087424" url="?curid=1229248" title="Battle of Inverlochy (1645)">
<text>The Battle of Inverlochy occurred on 2 February 1645, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, when a Royalist force of Highlanders and Confederate Irish troops under the overall command of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, routed and largely destroyed the pursuing forces of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, who had been encamped under the walls of Inverlochy Castle.

After being researched, the area was designated as a battlefield by Historic Scotland in 2011.

==Background==
After the Covenanter-controlled Scottish Committee of Estates decided to intervene in the English Civil War on the Parliamentarian side, the Royalist party sought to find ways of tying down Covenanter forces in Scotland to prevent them being employed in England. King Charles I had already given a commission to Montrose, a disaffected former signatory of the Covenant, to organise Royalist opposition in Scotland. The project was given impetus when Confederate Ireland, at the instigation of the Earl of Antrim and the Duke of Ormond, aided the Royalists by sending 2,000 experienced troops to Scotland under Antrim&#x27;s relative Alasdair Mac Colla. The Irish landed at Ardnamurchan on the west coast in early July 1644.

Montrose and a small number of Royalist clansmen linked up with Mac Colla in August. By this time the Committee of Estates had sent armies into the field against them, under the overall command of the experienced general William Baillie. Montrose, however, won surprise victories against government troops at Tippermuir and Aberdeen in September. He then retreated into the Highlands, pursued by a force under the Marquess of Argyll, the head of Clan Campbell and one of the key figures in the Committee of Estates, while Baillie&#x27;s main army blocked Montrose&#x27;s path eastward. By late November, the Royalists had added another 1,000 recruits, largely from amongst the men of Clan Donald. Over the winter they conducted a fierce campaign of burning and plundering largely directed against the lands of Argyll himself, and culminating in the sacking of Inveraray. Montrose left Inveraray on 14 January 1645 and headed north. It is believed that he split his army at Glen Etive sending part of it up past Ballachulish while the bulk continued across Rannoch Moor, into Glencoe.

Baillie and Argyll believed that Montrose&#x27;s force would easily be trapped or dispersed once the difficulty of supplying them in the Highlands in winter took hold. Indeed, by the end of January, Montrose had halted at Kilchummin in the Great Glen, with supplies exhausted and with his forces reduced to less than 2,000 due to sickness and desertions amongst the Highlanders, who were eager to return home with their plunder. At Kilchummin he learned that a large contingent of Northern Levies under the Earl of Seaforth blocked the route northward at Inverness, while Argyll – with a force made up of his own regiment, eight companies of Lowland foot sent by Baillie, and a large number of Clan Campbell levies – was camped to the south of him at Inverlochy. Further south, Baillie and Sir John Urry were assembling further troops. The Royalists were now effectively trapped.

==Flank march==
Montrose decided to face the threat by marching south and attacking Argyll. This course may have been chosen as Argyll&#x27;s men now threatened the lands of several of Montrose&#x27;s key supporters. However, he realised that a frontal approach would be quickly detected. What followed was a remarkable flanking march, during winter, across some of the toughest and wildest terrain in the British Isles, partly through snow knee-deep. The Royalists first travelled up the River Tarff to Glen Buck via Culachy, and across the gorge of the Calder Burn to reach the head of the glen, 1000 feet above sea level. They then climbed a further 1000 feet to Carn na Larach, before travelling down Glen Turret and Glen Roy to Keppoch, where the advance guard rested for around three hours in a barn while the main force caught up.

After fording the Spean, and passing through Leanachan Woods, they emerged on the slopes of Ben Nevis above Inverlochy in the early hours of Candlemas Day, 2 February; they had marched around 36 miles in 36 hours.

==Battle==
Montrose&#x27;s army spent a cold night in the open on the side of Ben Nevis. Argyll was already aware that a small force was operating in the area, having been alerted by pickets driven from Keppoch by the Royalist advance guard. He did not know, however, that he was faced by the entire royal army. Just before dawn on 2 February 1645, Argyll and his commanders were dismayed at the sight that lay before them. As far as they were aware Montrose should still have been 30 miles north.

===Order of Battle and deployments===

**Irish Brigade Alasdair Mac Colla
***Thomas Laghtnan&#x27;s Regiment (400 men)

***James McDonnell&#x27;s Regiment (200)
**MacDonald, Cameron and other clan levies (c.500)
**Patrick Graham of Inchbrackie&#x27;s Regiment (200)

Argyll did not stay for the battle, having injured his arm in a fall from his horse, and retired to his galley anchored on Loch Linnhe. Command of the government forces was left in the hands of his kinsman Sir Duncan Campbell of Auchinbreck, described by Robert Baillie as &quot;a stout soldier, but a very vicious man&quot;. Auchinbreck was an experienced veteran recently recalled from the war in Ireland and regarded as the best soldier in Clan Campbell.

Auchinbreck lined up his forces with the left wing anchored on Inverlochy Castle, which he reinforced with 200 musketeers to protect his left flank. In the centre he placed Argyll&#x27;s regiment, with an advance guard commanded by Gillespie, son of the Laird of Bingingeahds. On the flanks he put the 8 companies of Lowland militia sent by Baillie, under Roughe and Cockburn, while to the rear was a reserve of Campbell clan levies commanded by the lairds of Lochnell and Rarra, along with two light artillery pieces. Unlike at Tippermuir and Aberdeen, where Montrose had annihilated hastily conscripted and poorly trained militias, many of the troops he faced at Inverlochy were veterans of the wars in England and Ireland. Montrose lined his army up only two lines deep to avoid being outflanked, placing the clansmen, under his personal command, in the centre with the Irish on the flanks, the left being commanded by MacColla and the right by O&#x27;Cahan. A small troop of light cavalry, led by Sir Thomas Ogilvie of Airlie, protected the Royalist standard.

===Attack by Montrose===

The fight did not start straight away and instead skirmishes broke out along the line before dawn. This was possibly because Montrose wanted to harry Argyll&#x27;s men to ensure they did not slip away, whilst hiding his own presence and the full size of his army. Auchinbreck and his officers thought that they were only fighting one of Montrose&#x27;s lieutenants and not the man himself, believing he was still far up the glen. Wishart, Montrose&#x27;s biographer, claimed that they only realised Montrose and his cavalry were present on hearing trumpets used as the attack signal. Just before first light, the Royalists launched their attack.

O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s men advanced first, followed by Mac Colla. The Irish closed rapidly and violently with the regular troops on both flanks. Montrose, in his letter describing the battle, stated that they went quickly to &quot;push of pike and dint of sword&quot;. The Irish routed the two wings, exposing Auchinbreck&#x27;s centre. Montrose then launched the highlanders at Argyll&#x27;s regiment and the Campbell clansmen; as the first line was driven back on to the second, the latter panicked and broke. Some of the Lowland foot forming Auchinbreck&#x27;s left attempted to retreat into the castle, but were blocked by the Royalist cavalry under Ogilvie and driven to the shore of the loch. Auchinbreck was shot in the thigh while trying to rally his men and died shortly afterwards. The remaining Covenanters briefly rallied around their standard, then broke and ran. The battle rapidly became a &quot;massacre perpetrated by one set of feuding clansmen on another&quot;. Those who ran towards the loch were slaughtered, while the remainder attempted to escape into the hills. The small garrison in Inverlochy castle surrendered without a fight.

As was common in the battles of the era, the majority of casualties occurred during the rout of the retreating forces, who were pursued at least eight miles from the battlefield. In later years the graves of many of them were pointed out in Glen Nevis. Over 1500 Covenanter troops died, while Montrose lost very few men, reputedly as few as between four and eight, the most notable Royalist casualty being Sir Thomas Ogilvie who was hit by a stray bullet and died several days later. Many gentry and tacksmen serving under Argyll were killed, including John Campbell of Lochnell, Colin MacDougal of Rarra, and others. The remaining officers were all captured, although some, such as Cockburn, were shortly released on parole on the promise that they did not take up arms against the Royalists.

Iain Lom, the bard of the clan MacDonald of Keppoch, watched the battle from a vantage point on a hillside, and afterwards wrote the poem &quot;Là Inbhir Lochaidh&quot; (&quot;The Day of Inverlochy&quot;) about it.

==Aftermath==

On 11 February the Parliament of Scotland found Montrose and 19 of his main followers, including Mac Colla and Graham of Inchbrackie, guilty of high treason in their absence. The following day Argyll himself appeared before Parliament, with his arm in a sling, dismissing the loss as a minor setback. Robert Baillie afterwards wrote that &quot;this disaster did extremely amaze us. I verily think that had Montrose come presently from that battle he should have had no opposition in the Highlands [...] scarce till he had come to Edinburgh. But God in mercy put other thoughts in his heart&quot;.

Montrose was able to use this conflict to rally Clan Donald against Clan Campbell. In many respects, the Battle of Inverlochy was as much part of the clan war between these two deadly enemies and their allies as it was part of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, and that is how it was portrayed in Gaelic folklore. After the battle MacDonalds pursued fleeing Campbells up the Lairig Mhor, which is now part of the West Highland Way, killing those they caught. About 12 km from the battle field they stopped and marked the spot by erecting a stone which came to be known as Clach nan Caimbeulach or the Campbell&#x27;s Stone. Today the place is marked by a rough cairn, or pile of stones.

The victory also secured the cooperation in Montrose&#x27;s campaign of the Marquess of Huntly, whose Clan Gordon levies made him one of the most powerful nobles in Scotland.

The battle and the Royalist campaign of 1644–1645 in general feature in the 1937 novel And No Quarter by the Irish writer Maurice Walsh, told from the perspective of two members of O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s Regiment.

<doc id="1229250" wikidata="Q472640" url="?curid=1229250" title="Kawau Island">
<text>Kawau Island is in the Hauraki Gulf, close to the north-eastern coast of the North Island of New Zealand. At its closest point it lies off the coast of the Northland Peninsula, just south of Tāwharanui Peninsula, and about by sea journey from Sandspit Wharf, and shelters Kawau Bay to the north-east of Warkworth. It is north of Auckland. Mansion House in the Kawau Island Historic Reserve is an important historic tourist attraction. Almost every property on the Island relies on direct access to the sea. There are only two short roads serving settlements at Schoolhouse Bay and South Cove, and most residents have private wharves for access to their front door steps.

The island is named after the Māori word for the shag.

A regular ferry service operates to the island from Sandspit Wharf on the mainland, as do water taxi services.

==Geography==
The island is at its longest axes, and is almost bisected by the long inlet of Bon Accord Harbour which is geologically a &quot;drowned valley&quot;. The sheltered location of the bay has made it a favourite stop for yachts for more than a century. The island is formed primarily by greywacke rocks and small lava flows, which formed on the seafloor before the island was uplifted by tectonic forces. Many of these lava flows were associated with hydrothermal springs, which precipitated metal sulfides and minerals rich in iron, manganese and copper.

Approximately 17,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, Kawau Island was landlocked to the North Island, and surrounded by a vast coastal plain where the Hauraki Gulf exists today. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, after which Kawau became an island separated from the rest of New Zealand.

== History ==
Kawau, though providing little arable land, was well-favoured by Māori for its beautiful surrounding waters, with battles over the island common from the 17th century on. Traditional stories involve the ancestor Toi-te-huatahi naming the island Te Kawau Tu Maro, meaning the shag (cormorant) standing watch. Kawau was occupied for generations by Tāmaki Māori tribes including Te Kawerau and Ngāi Tai. A defensive pā, Momona, is found on the island, located in the south-west along the ridge close to modern-day Mansion House.

Entrepreneurs from New South Wales purchased the island in 1840, and shortly afterwards James Forbes Beattie formed the Kawau Company, intending to mine copper on the island. Miners from Falmouth, Cornwall were brought over for the operation, later joined by smelters from Wales, once it was discovered that unsmelted ore was a fire hazard for ships, and an ore smelting operation was begun on the island. A rival company, funded by Frederick Whitaker and Theophilus Heale, was granted land immediately outside of the Kawau Company&#x27;s land grant, giving them control of the wharf. The rival company created shafts underneath the Kawau Company&#x27;s land, which led to a confrontation when miners from the Kawau Company broke into the rival company&#x27;s heading. In 1846 the rival company&#x27;s grant was rejected, and the Kawau Company took full possession of the mines in 1848. In 1844/45 the island produced about 7,000 pounds of copper, which was about a third of Auckland&#x27;s exports for that year. The island was bought a few years later by Sir George Grey, Governor of New Zealand, in 1862 as a private retreat. Grey extended the original copper mine manager&#x27;s house (built 1845) to create the Mansion House, which still stands, and made the surrounding land into a botanical and zoological park, importing many plants and animals. The house changed hands several times after Grey, and decayed increasingly, but has been restored and furnished to its state in the period of Governor Grey and is now in public ownership in the Kawau Island Historic Reserve, administered by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. The reserve is public land and covers 10% of the Island, and includes the old copper mine, believed to be the site of New Zealand&#x27;s first underground metalliferous mining venture (1844). The ruins of the mine&#x27;s pumphouse are registered as a Category I heritage structure.

The island is home to kiwi and two-thirds of the entire population of North Island weka. Among the animals that Grey introduced were five species of wallabies, as well as kookaburra. Three of the six introduced wallaby species remain and do considerable damage to the native vegetation, thus harming the habitat for these flightless birds and other native fauna. The wallabies destroy all emerging seedlings which means that the present native trees are the last generation. The usual understorey forest species are absent due to wallaby browsing and in many cases the ground is bare. Possums, also introduced by Grey, destroy mature native trees. The result has been a considerable loss of biodiversity, with bird numbers plummeting due to loss of both food supply and habitat. Even the surrounding marine environment has been severely compromised by silt carried from the bare ground by rainwater.

Grey&#x27;s wallaby introduction however had some minor indirect benefit in the early 2000s, when species from the island were introduced into Australia&#x27;s Innes National Park to boost genetic diversity.

===Pohutukawa Trust New Zealand===
Pohutukawa Trust New Zealand was founded in 1992 by Ray Weaver and other private landowners who own 90% of the island, &quot;to rehabilitate the native flora and fauna of Kawau Island&quot;. Until then it was considered hopeless to reverse the considerable ecological damage caused by the introduced animal and plant species, and Kawau was said to be of historical rather than botanical importance. The Trust is a registered Charity and has run continuously since its beginnings in 1992. The Pohutukawa Trust was chaired until his death in 2015 by Ray Weaver, and is now chaired by his brother Carl. The Trust&#x27;s plan is to eradicate all introduced animal pests in stages starting firstly with wallabies, possums and stoats. Pest removal and the eradication of certain weed species and control others, will enable sustainable land use in a restored ecological setting of native flora and fauna. The ongoing program is funded by donations and sponsors. Both Wallaby and Possum numbers have been steadily since 1985 through sustained control, saving the coastal pōhutukawa tree, a New Zealand icon. From a period when possum numbers were at plague proportions across the island they are effectively absent form the private landowners properties. In the first quarter of 2024 the island was surveyed using trained detection dogs to establish the current status of stoats on the island and no trace of animals was able to be found. The trust is not able to claim at this stage that the inability of these specialized dejection teams to find presence of a stoat is that it has eradicated them at this stage but it is possible. As stoats are one of the major predators for young kiwi, the trusts removal of these animals is a significant contributing factor in kiwi numbers exploding since the early 2000s.

The response to pest control work has been increasing native bird numbers, including increased kiwi calls, brown teal, kaka, kererū, and bellbirds.

After assisting with capturing all of the rare brushtail rock wallabies that could economically be recovered from the private land for relocation to a successful captive breeding program established by Waterfall Springs Conservation Association in Wahroonga, Australia, Pohutukawa Trust New Zealand is now humanely eradicating the remaining wallabies from the island, to enable ecological restoration (mainly by natural regeneration). As at 2019 four wallaby species, Tammar wallaby, Parma wallaby, Bush-tailed rock-wallaby and Swamp wallaby, all continue to threaten the native species on the island.

An inventory of remaining indigenous plants and forest fragments on the island was compiled in 1996 and is being progressively enhanced to define the remnant resource still available for restoration, and several rare indigenous plant species have been discovered during the process.

Following the successful removal of Wallaby and Opossum other animal pests the Trust intends to eradicate in stages as resources enable included, feral cats, and ship rats. Exotic plants unpalatable to the wallabies have become serious invasive weeds on the island, and the Trust&#x27;s plans include eradication or control of these also as part of the ecological restoration process.

The serious threat of possums to New Zealand&#x27;s indigenous forest was first identified on Kawau by Ray Weaver in 1955. Since then possums have become a major animal pest in New Zealand, compromising both forest health and the country&#x27;s primary industries. Governor Grey introduced possums to Kawau in 1868–69. The first liberation in New Zealand is believed to have been by Captain Howell at Riverton in the South Island in 1837.

The Pohutukawa Trust New Zealand received a Green Ribbon Award from the Ministry for the Environment in 2003 &quot;for outstanding leadership and commitment to environmental protection&quot;.

=== Department of Conservation controlled land ===
About 10% of the island is under the control of the Department of Conservation, which tries to keep the protected areas free of invasive pests and animals. As at 2002, Kawau Island was home to the largest island population of North Island weka.

==Demographics==
Statistics New Zealand describes Kawau Island as a rural settlement which covers and includes Motuora, Moturekareka Island, Motuketekete Island, Takangaroa Island and Rabbit Island, all of which are uninhabited. It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. The area is part of the larger Gulf Islands statistical area.
Kawau Island had a population of 96 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 15 people (18.5%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 18 people (23.1%) since the 2013 census. There were 54 males and 45 females in 60 dwellings. 3.1% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 62.6 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 6 people (6.2%) aged under 15 years, 6 (6.2%) aged 15 to 29, 39 (40.6%) aged 30 to 64, and 45 (46.9%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 87.5% European (Pākehā); 12.5% Māori; and 3.1% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA). English was spoken by 100.0%, Māori language by 3.1%, and other languages by 9.4%. The percentage of people born overseas was 21.9, compared with 28.8% nationally.

<doc id="1229254" wikidata="Q934969" url="?curid=1229254" title="Spiceworld (album)">
<text>Spiceworld is the second studio album by English girl group the Spice Girls, released on 1 November 1997 by Virgin Records. Its music incorporates dance-pop music and production. The album became a commercial success worldwide, lengthening the so-called &quot;Spicemania&quot; of the time. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, with first-week sales of 190,000 copies and shipped 1.4 million copies in two weeks. The album also reached number one in 13 countries, while peaking inside the top three in Australia, Canada, France, Switzerland and the United States. &quot;Spiceworld&quot; has sold over 14 million copies worldwide, making it one of the world&#x27;s best-selling albums by a girl group.

The album spawned four singles, all of which saw commercial success. Its lead single &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; became an international success, peaking in the top five positions in many countries. It was followed by the singles &quot;Too Much&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot;, and &quot;Viva Forever&quot;, all of which attained commercial success on the charts. To promote the album, the Spice Girls embarked on their debut headlining concert tour, titled the Spiceworld Tour, covering Europe and North America for a total of 97 dates between February and September 1998. This is the last studio album with member Geri Halliwell, who left during the tour, but rejoined in 2007. An expanded edition of the album, titled &quot;Spiceworld25&quot;, was released on 4 November 2022 to celebrate its 25th anniversary.

==Background==
After releasing their hugely successful debut album, &quot;Spice&quot;, which later became one of the best-selling albums of all time, the group announced they were working on a second studio album. During the recording and writing of &quot;Spiceworld&quot; the group also filmed &quot;Spice World&quot;, a musical comedy film starring the Spice Girls as themselves. The album worked as a soundtrack to the film, with most of the songs from the album appearing in the film, with the exception of &quot;Move Over&quot;. 
Throughout 1997, the Spice Girls received massive media attention, which also included a few controversies. The group performed live for the first time for the British royal family. At the show, they breached royal protocol when Mel B and then Geri Halliwell planted kisses on Prince Charles&#x27;s cheeks and pinched his bottom. The group was also criticised in the United States for releasing their second album, &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, just nine months after the American release of their debut album, &quot;Spice&quot;. They received further criticism because of the impact and amount of sponsorship deals they had signed. They also made a decision to fire their manager Simon Fuller in November 1997, which was front-page news around the world.

In October 1997, the Spice Girls held a two-date concert in Istanbul titled Girl Power! Live in Istanbul, sponsored by Pepsi. During the concert the group premiered three new songs from &quot;Spiceworld&quot;: &quot;Too Much&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Divas&quot;. Two promotional singles from &quot;Spiceworld&quot; were released prior to the album release in 1997: &quot;Step to Me&quot; and &quot;Move Over (Generation Next)&quot;. Both songs were used in the Pepsi advertising campaigns and were also given away free with special ring pulls. The Japanese album version of &quot;Step to Me&quot; is slightly different from the original release of the song, while &quot;Move Over (Generation Next)&quot; was only released as a live version during its promotional release.

==Composition==

The album consists of pop music with dance-pop songs and production. According to AllMusic, the album&#x27;s music is &quot;catchier&quot; and has an &quot;intoxicating sense of fun&quot;. The album was also used as the soundtrack to their 1997 film &quot;Spice World&quot;. &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; is an uptempo dance-pop song, with influences of Latin rhythms such as salsa and samba. The lyrics to &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; are an international rally cry, targeted to a global market, as Melanie C described it: &quot;We always wanted to do a carnival tune and write a song for the world.&quot; &quot;Stop&quot; is an uptempo dance-pop song with influences of Motown&#x27;s blue-eyed soul, and is reminiscent of classic singles by the Supremes or Martha and the Vandellas. Lyrically, the song calls for a slowing down on the courtship process, and it is particularly addressed to appeal to the young female audience, as the female to female bonds are not threatened. &quot;Too Much&quot; is a pop ballad, with influences of R&amp;B music and doo-wop sounds, whereas &quot;Never Give Up on the Good Times&quot; is a dance-pop song with influences of disco. &quot;Viva Forever&quot; is a pop ballad with influences of Latin music. &quot;The Lady Is a Vamp&quot; has influences of jazz.

==Promotion==

===Singles===
&quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; was released as the lead single from the album on 13 October 1997. The song became an instant worldwide success, although it received negative reviews from music critics. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at number one, becoming the group&#x27;s fifth consecutive chart-topper, and was certified platinum by the BPI. &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; reached the top five in over 14 countries, while reaching number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Too Much&quot;, was released on 15 December 1997 and hit number one in the UK, becoming the group&#x27;s second consecutive Christmas number-one single. The song was certified platinum in the UK. In the US, &quot;Too Much&quot; peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, their fourth and so far last top-10 single there. The song also peaked at number nine in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.

The third single from &quot;Spiceworld&quot; was &quot;Stop&quot;. Critically, the song received mainly positive reviews from music critics, mostly praising the Motown-inspired music and production. It was released on 9 March 1998 and peaked at number two in the United Kingdom, ending the Spice Girls&#x27; streak of consecutive number-one singles on the UK chart at six. The single received a silver certification. In the US the song peaked at number 16 on the Hot 100. Elsewhere, &quot;Stop&quot; reached the top 10 in nine other countries.

The fourth and final single from the album was intended to be a double A-side release of &quot;Never Give Up on the Good Times&quot; and &quot;Viva Forever&quot;. However, due to Halliwell&#x27;s departure from the group, the plan was scrapped. Instead, &quot;Viva Forever&quot; was released alone on 20 July 1998. The song received critical acclaim from critics, as some called it &quot;genuine&quot;. &quot;Viva Forever&quot; reached number one in the United Kingdom and was certified platinum by the BPI. The song debuted at number one in New Zealand, becoming the band&#x27;s first chart-topper in that country since &quot;Wannabe&quot;. &quot;Viva Forever&quot; did not receive a single release in the United States.

===Live performances===

The Spice Girls performed &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; for the first time in the United Kingdom on 27 September 1997, on BBC&#x27;s programme National Lottery, which attracted more than nine million viewers. The song was subsequently performed many times on television, in both Europe and the US, including &quot;An Audience with...&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;All That&quot;, &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; was also performed in many award ceremonies such as the 1997 Smash Hits! Awards, the 1997 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 1997 Billboard Music Awards, the 1997 Premios Ondas, the 1997 Channel V Music Awards, and the 2000 Brit Awards. &quot;Too Much&quot; was performed several times on television, including &quot;An Audience with...&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and the 1997 Royal Variety Performance. The group also performed it at the 1997 Smash Hits! Awards, and at the 25th Annual American Music Awards. &quot;Stop&quot; was also performed many times on television, in both the UK and the US, including &quot;An Audience with...&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. For their &quot;Stop&quot; performance at the 1998 Brit Awards, the group adopted a Supremes-like look, and appeared on the stage in a 1960-style car. The group performed &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Viva Forever&quot; without Halliwell in Modena, Italy; for the annually hosted Pavarotti &amp; Friends charity concert in June 1998. &quot;Viva Forever&quot; was performed with Halliwell on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 21 May 1998 and without her on 27 May 1998 at the National Lottery. In October 1997 the Spice Girls held a two-date concert on Abdi İpekçi Arena in Istanbul, Turkey, performing four songs of &quot;Spiceworld&quot;: &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot;, &quot;Too Much&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Divas&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot;. The performance was broadcast on Showtime in a pay-per-view event titled &quot;Spice Girls in Concert Wild!&quot;.

===Tour===
In early 1998, the Spice Girls embarked on their first world tour that Fuller had set up for them covering Europe and North America for 97 dates. The Spiceworld Tour kicked off in Dublin, Ireland, on 24 February 1998 before moving on to mainland Europe and then returning to the UK for two gigs at Wembley Arena and 12 gigs at Birmingham&#x27;s NEC Arena. On 31 May 1998, Halliwell left the group during the tour&#x27;s run. The remaining girls continued the tour to its last date without Halliwell. A VHS release of the group&#x27;s performance at Wembley Stadium, titled &quot;Live at Wembley Stadium&quot;, was released on 24 November 1998.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Spiceworld&quot; received positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote that the album &quot;boast[s] a more consistent (and catchier) set of songs [than &quot;Spice&quot;] and an intoxicating sense of fun&quot;, concluding that &quot;each song has a strong melody and a strong, solid beat, whether it&#x27;s a ballad or a dance number. It&#x27;s a pure, unadulterated guilty pleasure and some of the best manufactured mainstream dance-pop of the late &#x27;90s.&quot; David Browne from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated, &quot;Trading verses in this and other songs, they transform the numbers into audio pajama parties full of sisterly advice, support, and warnings. Part heart, part mind, all cotton candy, &quot;Spiceworld&quot; may just be the answer to one of life&#x27;s most vexing quandaries.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s David Wild commented that, compared to &quot;Spice&quot;, &quot;Spiceworld&quot; is &quot;a masterful effort; at its best, it reaches creative heights that are downright Bananaramian.&quot; In a mixed review, Craig D. Lindsey of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; expressed, &quot;Anyone expecting a maelstrom of artistic evolution from these women ought to relax a little; it&#x27;s only music, for chrissakes. And the Spice Girls and their handlers deserve bonus points for showing a little common sense. After all, if this were seven years ago, they might have taken their precious time releasing &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, while the group&#x27;s hype was irreversibly extinguished.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Spiceworld&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, selling 192,000 copies and shipping 1.4 million copies in its first week. The album was certified five-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 19 December 1997, and had sold 1,603,426 copies in the United Kingdom as of October 2019. The album reached number one in several European countries, including Austria, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Norway. It was certified five-times platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), denoting sales in excess of five million copies across Europe. In Japan, &quot;Spiceworld&quot; peaked at number six on the Oricon Albums Chart and earned a double platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). In Oceania, the album reached number two in Australia and number one in New Zealand; it was ceritifed six-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ).

The album debuted at number eight on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 83,000 copies. Sales increased week by week, its best week being that of 3 January 1998 when it sold 284,000 copies. The album finally peaked at number three on 14 February, when &quot;Spice&quot; also returned to the top 10, making the Spice Girls the first British group to have two albums in the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at the same time since the Rolling Stones in mid-1975. The album sold 1.74 million copies in the first 12 weeks and 3.2 million in the first 10 months. It was certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 19 May 1999, and by December 2007, it had sold 4.2 million copies in the US. In Canada, the album peaked at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart, with first-week sales of 34,871 copies and was certified diamond by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for shipments of one million copies. Spiceworld was a big success in Canada, it was the group&#x27;s second diamond-selling album and spent 43 weeks in the Top 10 and 60 weeks in the Top 20 album chart. &quot;Spiceworld&quot; had sold 13 million copies by the end of 1998, making it one of the world&#x27;s best-selling albums by a girl group.

==&quot;Spiceworld25&quot;==
On 27 September 2022, the Spice Girls announced the release of the 25th-anniversary edition of &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, titled &quot;Spiceworld25&quot;. The expanded edition features previously unreleased live versions and remixes, in addition to previously available B-sides &quot;Walk of Life&quot; and &quot;Outer Space Girls&quot; and a megamix. The anniversary had first been teased in July 2022, when they released an image of the Earth with a &quot;Spiceworld25&quot; banner across it. Their 1997 song &quot;Step to Me&quot; was released digitally for the first time on the same day as the album announcement. &quot;Step to Me&quot; had originally been released in 1997 as part of a Pepsi promotion, where fans could obtain the CD single if they collected enough ring pulls.

&quot;Spiceworld25&quot; was released digitally on 4 November 2022 by UMC, as well as on double LP, double cassette, picture disc and clear vinyl. On the same day, an official montage music video for &quot;Never Give Up on the Good Times&quot; was released, and was directed by Kiran Mistry. A two-CD and hardback book set was released on 16 December 2022.

On 11 November 2022, following the release of &quot;Spiceworld25&quot;, &quot;Spiceworld&quot; re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number 46 with 2,257 copies sold.

<text>Automatische TreinBeïnvloeding or ATB (&#x27;Automatic train control&#x27;) is a Dutch train protection system first developed in the 1950s. Its installation was spurred by the Harmelen train disaster of 1962.

ATB operates by the train collecting electrical signals from line-side apparatus and will override the driver&#x27;s controls in the following situations:

* a) failure to reduce speed at a caution signal (ATB will slow the train sufficiently to stop at the next signal).
* b) failure to observe speed limit (ATB makes an immediate emergency brake application)

== ATB-EG ==
ATB-EG &quot;(&quot;ATB Eerste Generatie &quot;English: ATB First Generation&quot;) is based on the American Pulse Code Cab Signaling system. It is installed on all major Dutch rail lines. 

=== Technical overview ===
ATB-EG controls 5 speeds: 40 km/h, 60 km/h, 80 km/h, 130 km/h and 140 km/h. Just like Pulse Code Cab Signaling the system works by sending pulses along the AC track circuit. When the circuit is closed by the train&#x27;s front wheels an electromagnetic field is created with each pulse. These fields electromagnetically energise two coils in front of the leading axle which feed the pulses to the ATB-system. The onboard ATB system works out the amount of pulses per minutes and translates this to the 5 codes Yellow, Yellow6, Yellow8, Yellow13 and Green with corresponding speeds of 40, 60, 80, 130 and 140 km/h or so-called &quot;volle materieelsnelheid&quot; (full train speed). If the train&#x27;s maximum allowed speed is lower (as for instance the SGM), the speed settings above its maximum speed will be omitted.
=== Operation ===
The speed limit enforced by ATB-EG is presented to the driver by a row of lights, with the current cab signal illuminated, (Mat 64, SLT, PROTOS and THALYS) which can be integrated into speedometer (ICM and SGM) or either a red needle (VIRM, DDAR and Class 1700) or yellow LED (FLIRT and GTW) on the outside of the speedometer. The driver will be informed of a speed change with a short &quot;ding&quot;. If the driver exceeds the current ATB-speed by 5 km/h a bell will start to ring continuously. If the driver does not brake within 3 seconds the ATB will initiate an emergency brake application.

When a stretch of track has an ATB code for a lower speed, due to a lower track speed or a diverging switch etc., the section before it will carry that code as well. A signal or sign guarding the first section will inform the driver of the oncoming speed reduction and upon entering that block the ATB will change to the target speed. According to the ATB the train is now overspeeding so it will initiate the continuous bell, informing the driver that they need to start braking. Once again, if the driver does not brake within 3 seconds the ATB will initiate an emergency brake application. The system will stop the warning once the driver is braking sufficiently, this is checked by means of the so-called &quot;remcriterium&quot; (English: brake criterion). The &quot;remcriterium&quot; is based on either the brake pipe pressure, brake cylinder pressure or the position of the brake lever. This should ensure the train reaches the target speed before the next block, but it often proves inadequate. When the train is within the 5 km/h margin of the target speed the system rings three short bells, informing the driver that they are allowed to stop braking.

=== Failsafe ===
After passing a red signal and entering a section already occupied by another train, the track circuit is already shorted by the other train preventing the signal from reaching the train passing the red signal. Therefore, the absence of a signal is interpreted as the most restrictive signal, making the system fail-safe. To allow driving on sight onto occupied track, which cannot be discerned from passing a red signal using a system like this, receiving no signal was chosen to be interpreted as a speed limit of 40 km/h.

=== Design limitations ===
ATB-EG has a number of drawbacks when compared to modern systems like ETCS

# ATB-EG does not enforce speeds below 40 km/h.
# The system only has 5 speed settings, leaving room for overspeeding.
# ATB-EG does not allow speeds above 140 km/h while there are lines designed with a higher speed limit.
# The braking power enforced by ATB-EG often proves insufficient.
# Rails are also used as return for the catenary, it is therefore possible for electric trains to interfere with the ATB signal. 
# ATB EG will only work with good contact between the rails and train wheels.

One of the early system&#x27;s design limitations was the inability to enforce speeds below 40 km/h. Several accidents at train stations and railroad yards occurred because the driver failed to stop at a red signal and ATB did not intervene, as it had already enforced a speed below 40 km/h. Strange as this limitation may seem, there was a reason for it. The main purpose of ATB was to prevent overspeeding and failing to respond to yellow signals, at the time it was deemed unlikely a driver would miss a red signal when traveling below 40 km/h and expecting one. It is seen as a problem now as numerous accidents have occurred and safety regulations became stricter over time.

The gaps between each speed setting form a problem. If there is no matching speed setting for the current speed limit, the next speed setting above it will be enforced. The biggest gap falls between 80 and 130 km/h, meaning ATB EG will allow a train to drive 130 km/h in a 90 km/h zone.

Another drawback is the maximum speed being set to 140 km/h. Tracks with a design speed of up to 160 km/h cannot be used up to full speed because ATB-EG does not allow this. This is becoming more of an issue with the ever-growing rail traffic. ATBM+ has later been developed to raise this speed to 160 km/h.

Vossloh G2000 locomotives equipped with ATB EG suffer from some unwanted emergency brake applications. This is because the brake pipe pressure, on which the brake criterion is based, takes 4 to 5 seconds to drop, while the ATB intervenes in 3 seconds.FLIRT trains have the same problem as the G2000 locomotives, because their brake criterion is based on the brake cylinder pressure. Additionally the brake criterion can &quot;vanish&quot; when the anti-lock braking system engages, because the system could reduce the brake pressure below the point to comply with the brake criterion. This will also result in an emergency brake application.

=== Enhancements ===
Over the years multiple enhancements were introduced to overcome some of the system&#x27;s flaws.

ATBM+ is designed to raise the maximum speed from 140 to 160 km/h. This system is only installed on line between Hoofddorp and Den Haag Mariahoeve and is currently solely used by Thalys trains

ATB-Plus-Plus is designed to reduce &quot;Stoptonend Sein (STS)-passages&quot; (English: Signals Passed At Danger) by applying an emergency brake after passing a signal at danger. It compensates the original design flaws in speeds below 40 km/h where no forced braking was possible in case of passing stop signals.

ATB-Vv (Verbeterde versie &quot;English:&quot; &quot;Improved version&quot;) is the latest evolution of ATB-Plus-Plus. It is enhanced with three beacons in distance of 120, 30 and 3 m before the attributed signal, using technology comparable with German PZB. After activation by ATB-Vv the movement of the train is self-controlled with regard to the braking curve. So the chance of a &quot;Stoptonend Sein (STS)-passages&quot; (English: Signals Passed At Danger) is minimal. The system is not fail-safe as a broken beacon will result in the train not braking automatically.

==ATB-NG ==
Since 1990 a second generation, ATB-NG (ATB Nieuwe Generatie &quot;English: ATB New Generation&quot;), has been developed to overcome all the problems posed by ATB-EG. The systems is completely different from ATB-EG and operates nearly equal to ETCS Level 1, ATB-EG and ATB-NG can both can safely be installed at the same track as they do not interfere with each other. Trainborne ATB-NG equipment is also able to receive ATB-EG signals, making the system backwards compatible. Because major, electrified routes received priority when installing ATB-EG, ATB-NG is almost exclusively found on diesel-lines as these were the only unprotected routes when the system came out. One exception is the former diesel line between Zwolle and Wierden which was electrified between 2016 and 2017.

=== Operation ===
The system works by conveying movement authorization via balises between the tracks, called beacons, located next to signals and in other strategic places. These beacons are offset towards the left as seen from the driver, making the system directional. The system manages the maximum speed, maximum travel distance, the exit speed and the &quot;release-speed&quot;. Speed limits are set in 10 km/h intervals from 0 through 200 km/h and indicated by a yellow LED next to the maximum speed on the speedometer. If the train exceeds the maximum speed by more than 2,5 km/h the LED will start to flash and from 5 km/h above the maximum speed a bell will ring. If the maximum speed is exceeded by 7,5 km/h the emergency brakes will be applied. Braking is managed by a brake-curve relative to the weight of the train. When the train approaches the point where it needs to start braking, the yellow LED will jump to the target speed and a red LED will light up at the former position. The red LED will steadily decrease towards the target speed, ensuring the driver brakes accordingly. If the train speed exceeds the red LED by 7,5 km/h a brake application is induced. When the train reaches the target speed three short bells will sound, informing the driver that they can stop braking, and the red LED will disappear. The exit speed, which has to be reached when the movement authority ends, is displayed by a dot-matrix below the speedometer. An illuminated bar next to the speedometer shows the remaining distance until this speed has to be reached. When the exit speed is the same as the current speed the bar will remain dark. If the movement authority ends before the next beacon is reached, the train can continue with a specified &quot;release-speed&quot;, often 30 km/h, until it receives new authority from the next beacon.

=== Flaws ===
One weakness of the system is wheelslip caused by slippery rails. ATB-NG measures the traveled distance by counting the wheel rotations; therefore, the system will think the train is ahead of its actual position when the wheelspin occurs. This can result in premature brake interventions when approaching a red signal as the system thinks the train has already passed the signal, while it might still be several meters away.

Another problem is the fact that ATB-NG can&#x27;t react to signal changes. If a red signal clears ATB-NG will still force the train to stop and only let it creep forward until it reaches the next beacon. This issue can however be solved by installing ATB loops which enable the system to pick up signal updates in a stretch of track before the signal.

An issue with the ATB-NG system as a product is the patent held by ACEC-Alstom, which limits other manufacturers to supply the system and the fact that it offers poor interoperability with other systems.

== Implementation ==
The implementation is shown in the map above. Beside intermediately closing of functional gaps, new constructed lines will use European Train Control System (ETCS) as part of the assigned standard ERTMS. ETCS is already in use on Betuweroute line and HSL-Zuid.

<text>Francis Asbury Roe (October 4, 1823 – December 28, 1901) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Born in Elmira, New York, Roe entered the United States Navy as a midshipman on October 19, 1841, and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in 1848.

Roe left the Navy for eleven months, from June 1848 to May 1849, serving aboard the mail steamer SS &quot;Georgia&quot;.

After he returned to the Navy, he was assigned to the brigantine and served in an expedition to chart the North Pacific. Cape Roe on the Japanese island of Tanegashima was named for him during this expedition. In 1854, while serving in &quot;Porpoise&quot; on the Asiatic Station, he participated in an engagement with 13 Chinese armored junks off Macau. Six of the junks were sunk and the others were scattered.

Roe received his commission as master on August 8, 1855, and as lieutenant on September 14 of the same year. From 1857 to 1858 he served in the United States Coast Survey.

During the Civil War, in April 1862, he was recommended for promotion for gallantry for his actions on board the screw steamer while serving as executive officer, as that ship led Admiral David Farragut&#x27;s starboard column past Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on July 16, 1862, and placed in command of the gunboat on the Mississippi River. While commanding &quot;Katahdin&quot;, Roe defeated Confederate general John C. Breckinridge&#x27;s attack on Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Roe was ordered to command the side-wheel steamer on the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron in September 1863, and captured and destroyed several blockade runners in the sounds of North Carolina. Eight months later he was again commended for gallantry for engaging the Confederate ram and capturing the gunboat on May 5, 1864.

After the end of the war, Roe commanded the iron-hulled warship on the Great Lakes, where he and his crew took action in the 1865 Upper Peninsula miners&#x27; strike. He was promoted to commander on July 25, 1866, and given command of the steamer on a special mission to Mexico. Roe served as fleet captain for the Asiatic Station from 1868 to 1871.

Roe was promoted to captain on April 1, 1872, and commanded the screw sloop on the Brazil Station from 1874 to 1875. He was promoted to commodore on November 26, 1880, and to rear admiral on November 3, 1884, while serving as governor of the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was transferred to the retired list on October 4, 1885.

Roe died in Washington, D.C., on December 28, 1901, aged 78, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Namesake==
The United States Navy has named two destroyers in his honor.

<doc id="1229268" wikidata="Q1822828" url="?curid=1229268" title="Fluid inclusion">
<text>A fluid inclusion is a bubble of liquid and/or gas that is trapped within a crystal. As minerals often form from a liquid or aqueous medium, tiny bubbles of that liquid can become trapped within the crystal, or along healed crystal fractures. These inclusions usually range in size from 0.01 mm to 1 mm and are only visible in detail by microscopic study, however specimens of fenster or skeletal quartz may include thin sheet-like inclusions that are many millimetres in length and breadth within their lamellar voids.

These inclusions occur in a wide variety of environments. For example, they are found within cementing minerals of sedimentary rocks, in gangue minerals such as quartz or calcite in hydrothermal circulation deposits, in fossil amber, and in deep ice cores from the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps. The inclusions can provide information about the conditions existing during the formation of the enclosing mineral. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy can be used to determine the composition of fluid inclusions.

== Formation ==
Hydrothermal ore minerals, which typically form from high temperature aqueous solutions, trap tiny bubbles of liquids or gases when cooling and forming solid rock. The trapped fluid in an inclusion preserves a record of the composition, temperature and pressure of the mineralizing environment. An inclusion often contains two or more phases. If a vapor bubble is present in the inclusion along with a liquid phase, simple heating of the inclusion to the point of resorption of the vapor bubble gives a likely temperature of the original fluid. If minute crystals, such as halite, sylvite, hematite or sulfides, are present in the inclusion, they provide direct clues as to the composition of the original fluid.

== Fluid inclusions and mineral exploration ==

Fluid inclusions can provide useful data in mineral exploration, as their characteristics depend on the mineralization process. The methods of using fluid inclusions to identify mineral deposits include assessing the abundance of a specific inclusion type, looking into variations in the inclusions&#x27; temperatures of phase changes during heating and cooling, and variations in other properties such as decrepitation behavior, and inclusions chemistry. Observation and point-counting of thin-sections of samples is used to identify the occurrence of specific inclusion types. If an abundance of similar fluid inclusions are found in close geographic proximity, one can conclude that the surrounding rock types are similar if not the same. Microthermometric properties (changes in temperature during phase changes) are used to characterize and categorize areas that witnessed thermal activity during mineral formation.

Fluid inclusions have been used to identify deposits of oil and gas. Drilling cuts, cores, and/or outcrop materials are preserved for their pore-fluids, and the chemistry of the fluid is analyzed with Fluid Inclusion Stratigraphy (FIS). FIS analysis takes the spectrometric reading of a fluid inclusion&#x27;s volatile species; these are indicative of a natural gas or oil deposit nearby. The abundance of similar fluid inclusions could, however, be attributed to hydrocarbon migration and accumulation, so other techniques are used to confirm the presence of the oil deposit after initial detection of fluid inclusions.

== Metamorphic signatures ==
In the recent years, fluid inclusion research has been extensively applied to understand the role of fluids in the deep crust and crust-mantle interface. Fluid inclusions trapped within granulite facies rocks have provided important clues on the petrogenesis of dry granulite facies rocks through the influx of CO2-rich fluids from sub-lithospheric sources. CO2-rich fluid inclusions were also recorded from a number of ultra high temperature granulite facies terranes, suggesting the involvement of CO2 in extreme crustal metamorphism. Some recent studies speculate that CO2 derived by sub-solidus decarbonation reactions during extreme metamorphism has contributed to the deglaciation of the snowball Earth.

== Orogenic application ==
Fluid inclusions trapped in veins and minerals have been used as a proxy to explore the deformation history in orogenic belts. As fluid activities are considerably more in shear zones in an orogenic belt, the fluid inclusions in a shear zone have been also used to explore the seismic activities during the evolution of the shear zone. In orogenic belts the earthquakes sometimes attributed to be linked with fluid activity at depth. Indirect geophysical evidence points out the role of fluid in earthquakes in many shear zones, however a few studies provide geological evidence for the role of fluid in earthquakes. 

== Paleoclimate applications ==
Trapped bubbles of air and water within fossil amber can be analyzed to provide direct evidence of the climate conditions existing when the resin or tree sap formed. The analysis of these trapped air bubbles provides a record of atmosphere composition going back 140 million years. The data indicate that the oxygen content of the atmosphere reached a high of nearly 35% during the Cretaceous Period and then plummeted to near present levels during the early Tertiary. The abrupt decline corresponds to or closely follows the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and may be the result of a major meteorite impact that created the Chicxulub Crater.

In paleoceanography studies, fluid inclusions can inform about the chemical composition of seawater. The trapped seawater in sediments evaporates and leaves behind the salt content. The depth at which these evaporites are found relative to the composition of the trapped salt allows oceanographers to reconstruct seawater evolution. Air bubbles trapped within the deep ice caps can also be analyzed for clues to ancient climate conditions.

<doc id="1229279" wikidata="Q3468499" url="?curid=1229279" title="Mount Kennedy">
<text>Mount Kennedy is a peak in the Saint Elias Mountains within Kluane National Park, in Yukon, Canada. Its 4250-m to 4300-m (14000-foot) summit lies within 10 km of the Alaska Panhandle. Dusty Glacier lies against it to the north.

The Canadian government named the peak in honour of U.S. President John F. Kennedy nearly a year following his assassination. In announcing the decision to the House of Commons on November 20, 1964, prime minister Lester B. Pearson said &quot;I believe it is appropriate that Canada&#x27;s memorial to him should be a mountain. A mountain is solid and enduring. Mount Kennedy is a graceful, towering, unencumbered peak ... a symbol of aspiration and upward reach.&quot; It was at the time, the highest peak in North America that had not yet been climbed. American mountaineer Bradford Washburn who had aided the Canadian government in selecting the peak said that &quot;the Canadians sought a mountain that had not previously been named, that towered lofty and magnificent, and that lay as close as possible to the international boundary, where it would endure as a symbol of the unique friendship that exists between our two great nations.&quot;

==First ascent==
Its first ascent was in 1965 by Robert F. Kennedy, with a party of experienced mountaineers sponsored by the National Geographic Society and led by Jim Whittaker. Upon reaching the peak of the summit, Kennedy left some of his brother&#x27;s PT-boat tie clips, a copy of his brother&#x27;s 1961 inaugural 
address, and a John F. Kennedy medallion. This route from the Cathedral Glacier to the south is now considered a routine climb for experienced glacier travelers, having little technical difficulties other than navigation of extensive crevasse fields and avoidance of avalanches. Since then, other routes have been completed, including the highly technical North Buttress, first climbed in 1968 using siege tactics (placing fixed ropes and returning to a base camp), and finally in 2001 in purely alpine style (continuous ascent from bottom to summit with no fixed ropes).

Climbers in the first ascent party included:
* Jim Whittaker (1929–)
* Robert F. Kennedy (1925–1968)
* George R. Senner (1922–2003)
* Dee Molenaar (1918–2020)
* Bill Prater (1926–2010)
* Barry Prather (1940–1987)
* James Adam Craig (1924–2011) (only Canadian on the trip)
* William Allard, National Geographic Photographer

<doc id="1229284" wikidata="Q618344" url="?curid=1229284" title="Wellsford">
<text>Wellsford () is a town on the Northland Peninsula in the northern North Island of New Zealand. It is the northernmost major settlement in the Auckland Region, and is northwest of the Auckland CBD. It is a major regional centre, being located at the junction of State Highways 1 and 16, almost halfway between Auckland and the Northland city of Whangārei.

The eastern Kaipara Harbour has been settled by Māori since the 13th or 14th centuries, who utilised the inland forests and marine resources of the Kaipara Harbour. The area became home to the Ngāti Whātua collective Te Uri-o-Hau by the mid-17th century, with hapū including Ngāti Mauku, Ngāti Tahuhu and Ngāti Rongo being established from the descendants of Haumoewhārangi, and by strategic marriages with Te Kawerau hapū.

Wellsford was established by the Albertlanders in 1862, a group of Baptist tradespeople and farmers from the Birmingham area who settled the southern Oruawharo River, developing into a timber and kauri gum. By the early 20th century, the area developed into a regional centre for dairy farming, in part due to the opening of Wellsford railway station in 1909, linking the town to Auckland.

==Etymology==

The settlement was originally known by its Māori name Whakapirau, which is the name of the local creek flowing into the Kaipara Harbour. The settlers disliked the name, which they interpreted to mean &quot;stinking canoe&quot;, and began searching for a new name. The name was changed to Wellsford at a public meeting sometime between the late 1860s and early 1870s. The name was suggested by resident D.R. Lester, allegedly by creating an acronym from the surnames of settler families in the area. The earliest known references in print to Wellsford date to 1874. The modern site of Wellsford township was often referred to as the Gum Ridge in the 1870s.

==Geography==
Wellsford is close to a narrowing of the Northland Peninsula caused by an arm of the Kaipara Harbour on the west coast extending inland for from the body of the harbour, stretching to within of the east (Pacific Ocean) coast.

The town is located on hilltops at the junction between State Highway 1 and State Highway 16. The upper reaches of the Whakapirau Creek are located to the north of the town, while southern Wellsford is in the catchment of the Hōteo River. The Whakapirau Creek is a tributary of the Oruawharo River, an arm of the Kaipara Harbour.

The highest point in the town is a hill located east of the junction of Matheson Road and Worthington Road.

==History==
===Māori history===
During the mid-18th century, Ngāti Whātua peoples of Northland migrated south to the Kaipara Harbour. The northern and eastern Kaipara, including Wellsford, were controlled by Te Uri-o-Hau, a Ngāti Whātua tribal grouping led by Haumoewhārangi. Ngāti Rongo developed as a hapū in the area through the union between Haumoewhārangi&#x27;s granddaughter Moerangaranga and Maki&#x27;s son Ngāwhetu, and Ngāti Manuhiri developed ties with Te Uri-o-Hau. Te Uri-o-Hau, including the hapū Ngāti Mauku and Ngāti Tahuhu, lived seasonally along the Oruawharo River.

In the 1820s during the Musket Wars, the eastern Kaipara was depopulated, as people sought refuge in other parts of the country. Te Uri-o-Hau and Ngāti Rango gradually returned to the area by the late 1830s.

===Early colonial era===

The banks of the Oruawharo River were purchased by the Crown in 1860, followed by the Hoteo Block to the south in 1868.

Under a Special Settlement Scheme by the Government, the Oruawharo Block became a planned settlement, predominantly settled by Baptist tradespeople and farmers from the Birmingham area, who settled between 1862 and 1865 at Tāpora, Port Albert and Wellsford. These settlers called themselves the Albertlanders, after Prince Albert, Queen Victoria&#x27;s consort. They were a &quot;breakaway group from the Anglican Church looking for a new world&quot;. Wellsford was originally known by the name Whakapirau, and settlers established a settlement between the Whakapirau Stream and the eastern borders of the Oruawharo Block.

Initial industry at Whakapirau was dominated by the timber trade, and in 1864 Nicholson&#x27;s timber mill was established on the southern banks of the Oruawharo River. Kauri gum diggers&#x27; camps were established across the area in the 1870s, including a area called the Wayby Kauri Gum Reserve that was set aside for the practice. The modern Wellsford township site was also dug for kauri gum, and was often referred to as The Gum Ridge. Members of Te Uri-o-Hau traded and intermingled with the Alberton settlers. The settlement&#x27;s modern name, Wellsford, was likely adopted in the early 1870s. Wellsford would move eastwards over time to its current location.

In 1885, the Crown purchased the Pakiri Block from Ngāti Manuhiri, an area that included the areas immediately adjacent to Wellsford. This led to the expansion of Wellsford to the south, away from the Whakapirau Stream.

===Establishment of the railway, modern development===
By 1900, the timber and kauri gum trades had begun to recede, and settlers turned to dairy farming as a primarily source of income. The Wayby Co-operative Dairy Company established in 1902. In 1909, the North Auckland Line was extended north to Wellsford. This led to economic development in Wellsford, especially dairy farming and sheep farming operations. During this period, the town gradually moved away from the shores of the Whakapirau Stream, with the new centre of Wellsford developing near the train station.

Dairy farming in the region intensified further with the establishment of better roads in the 1930s. As roads improved, the town developed as a service stop for people travelling between Auckland and Whangārei along State Highway 1. Passenger train services to Wellsford ceased in 1975. In 1979, Irwin Industrial Tools was established in Wellsford, constructing circular saw-blades and growing to be a major local employer, before closing in 2009.

The local Ōruawharo Marae is a traditional meeting ground for Te Uri-o-Hau and the Ngāti Whātua hapū of Ngāti Mauku and Ngāti Tahuhu. It includes the Rangimārie meeting house. In 1990, the Albertland Heritage Museum opened in Wellsford.

By the 21st century, tourism and lifestyle blocks has increasingly drawn people to Wellsford. The Auckland Northern Motorway is planned to be extended from Warkworth to Wellsford in the future, and housing developments in the 2020s have been predicted to increase the size of the town by more than 800 houses.

<text>The EMD E8 is a , A1A-A1A passenger-train locomotive built by General Motors&#x27; Electro-Motive Division (EMD) of La Grange, Illinois. A total of 450 cab versions, or E8As, were built from August 1949 to January 1954, 447 for the U.S. and 3 for Canada. 46 E8Bs were built from December 1949 to January 1954, all for the U.S. The 2,250 hp came from two 12 cylinder model 567B engines, each driving a generator to power the two traction motors on one truck. The E8 was the ninth model in the line of passenger diesels of similar design known as EMD E-units. Starting in September 1953, a total of 21 E8As were built which used either the 567BC or 567C engines.

In profile the front of the nose of E7, E8, and E9 units is less slanted than earlier EMD units, so E7/8/9s (and their four axle cousins, the F-unit series) have been nicknamed &quot;bulldog nose&quot; units. Earlier E-unit locomotives were nicknamed &quot;slant nose&quot; units. After passenger trains were canceled on the Erie Lackawanna in 1970 (excluding their commuter service, which the State of New Jersey subsidized starting in the late 1960s), the E8s were re-geared for freight and were very reliable for the EL. These units were on freight trains until the early years of Consolidated Railroad Corporation (&quot;Conrail&quot;). Amtrak used 148 E8As, 3 E8AMs, and 5 E8Bs, these all being retired between 1975 and 1985.

Units noted with the designation E8m were rebuilt using components from earlier EMC/EMD locomotives. Externally the units look just like E8s. The difference in horsepower produced in these E8m units is because the older generators are reused.

==Original owners==
==Surviving examples==

It is estimated that 58 E8s have survived. The former NYC 4085, preserved at the New York Central Railroad Museum, was the lead locomotive on the final eastbound 20th Century Limited. Another surviving E8 was operated by the Midland Railway, in Baldwin City, Kansas. Privately owned, this unit is ex-Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad E8A #652 and was used for special events. It and its companion, E6A #630, have been sold to a new museum in Iowa, which will be centered around the Rock Island. New York Central 4097, privately owned, is on display at Merli Manufacturing Company in Duanesburg, New York.

The Monticello Railway Museum owns a former Pennsylvania Railroad E8A. It is currently undergoing restoration, and Monticello plans to paint it up as an Illinois Central E8 to match their collection of former Illinois Central passenger cars.

There are four Southern Railway E8As preserved. Unit #6900 is operational at the North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, North Carolina, while the railway&#x27;s #6901 is preserved at the Southeastern Railway Museum in Duluth, GA, and recently underwent an operational restoration by Norfolk Southern. These engines have pulled the Southern Crescent and both bear this train&#x27;s distinct logo. A Southern Railway E8, #6913, is being restored at the Southern Appalachia Railway Museum in Oak Ridge, TN for their Southern excursion train. Yet another, Southern #6914, is nearing the completion of a nearly two-decade-long restoration at the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum, having been unveiled at the railroad&#x27;s 2018 &quot;Railfest&quot;, resplendent in green and gold complete with &quot;NO&amp;NE&quot; sublettering.

The St Louis, Iron Mountain, &amp; Southern Railway owns former Pennsylvania Railroad E8A #5898. It was previously owned by the Blue Mountain &amp; Reading. It is the main engine used on their tourist train, and it was repainted in 2015.

Union Pacific E8AM #942 is owned by the Southern California Railway Museum, and is occasionally used on their tourist train, usually pulling the museum&#x27;s small collection of former Union Pacific passenger cars. It carries the designation E8AM from its time in Chicago-area commuter service. After its time on the Union Pacific, #942 was sold to the Chicago and Northwestern, which used it in commuter service. After serving with CNW, the 942 moved on to serve Chicago&#x27;s RTA. Upon retirement, it was donated to the museum, and subsequently restored to UP colors in 2012. It was rebuilt with a HEP generator which is what gives it the designation E8AM. However, unlike many E units rebuilt for commuter service, it retained its twin EMD 12-567B prime movers.
Chicago and North Western #5022B, later renumbered to 519 and then used by Metra, is now labeled as &quot;MREX 97&quot;, is at the Arizona Railway Museum. It is privately owned and stored on display.

Baltimore &amp; Ohio E8A #92 was kept offsite on a relic track at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland for many years after obtaining the unit from Amtrak (DOTX #210). On March 4, 2004, the museum gifted the unit to the West Virginia Railroad Museum. The WVRR Museum partnered with the Durbin &amp; Greenbrier Valley Railroad to undertake restoration of the unit as of February 20, 2024. 

Of the units owned by Conrail, three were saved after their freight-service retirement and went on to be refurbished by the Juniata Locomotive Shops in Altoona, PA for use as Conrail&#x27;s Office Car Special (OCS) until the merger of 1999. One unit went to CSX (never operated), and two were sold off to Bennett Levin, CEO of the Juniata Terminal Company, where they have been overhauled and painted as twin Pennsylvania Railroad E8&#x27;s. As of 2019, these units are not in operation due to a decision by the owner not to retrofit them with positive train control (PTC). 

Another, the former EL 833, was purchased by the New York and Greenwood Lake Railroad in 2007. The unit was repainted in its original livery as Erie 833, and was on display for a while on the turntable at Port Jervis, NY. Erie Railroad&#x27;s E8A No. 833 is stored at Port Jervis station, in Port Jervis, New York, and had occasionally run on excursion trains.

In June 2008, two authentic New York Central E8 units (4080 &amp; 4068) were brought to the Medina Railroad Museum in Western New York.

<text>Tamara Kern Hareven (May 10, 1937 – October 18, 2002) was a social historian who wrote extensively on the history of the family and the effects of social changes on family lives. Her books include &quot;Families, History and Social Change&quot; and &quot;Aging and Generational Relations&quot;. Born in Chernivtsi, Romania (now Ukraine), and of Jewish origin, she died of kidney failure at the age of 65.

==Early life and education==
At the age of four, Hareven and her parents were forced to leave their home in Chernivtsi and live in an internment camp in Ukraine due to their Jewish heritage. Hareven and her family survived the Holocaust, and eventually relocated to Palestine. Hareven&#x27;s early life contributed to her familiarity with languages including German, French, and English, in addition to her native Romanian and Hebrew.

Hareven earned her B.A. at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1960 and her M.A. in Medieval Jewish history at the University of Cincinnati in 1962. She completed her PhD at Ohio State University in American history with a dissertation on Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s role as a social reformer. This research led to the publication of her first book, &quot;Eleanor Roosevelt: An American Conscience&quot; (1968). She worked with her Ph.D. advisor John H. Bremner and others on &quot;Children and Youth in America&quot;, a seminal three volume collection that launched the field of the history of childhood. She was among the founders in North America of the history of the family as a serious field of study. She taught at Dalhousie University in Canada briefly before moving to Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts.

==Professional career==
Hareven was a major figure in establishing the field of family history. Before the 1970s, studies of history focused primarily on individuals in positions of power and status in society, such as politicians, military leaders, and those in the upper social classes. Hareven and her colleagues worked to legitimize the day-to-day experiences of &quot;ordinary&quot; people in the working classes as a valid and worthy part of the United States. Hareven was particularly interested in the role of the family as a liaison between individuals and industrial society.

In 1973, while at Clark, she organized a major international conference on the History of the Family. An outgrowth of the conference, a newsletter focused on the history of the family developed into the &quot;Journal of Family History&quot; in 1975. She later played a role in establishing &quot;The History of the Family: An International Quarterly.&quot; Her support for the work of younger scholars was a strong and consistent part of her career.

Between 1972 and 1977, Hareven and a group of student assistants conducted hundreds of intensive oral history interviews with former employees of the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company. In the course of this research, Hareven met Randolph Langenbach, an architectural historian and photographer, who was in the process of recording New England industrial buildings for historical preservation. Hareven and Langenbach collaborated on several projects, including &quot;Amoskeag: Life and Work in an American Factory City&quot; (1978), a result of Hareven&#x27;s oral history interviews. The two were married in 1973, and eventually divorced ten years later. Hareven would continue to publish her research on the Amoskeag with her 1982 book &quot;Family Time and Industrial Time: The Relationship Between the Family and Work in a New England Industrial Community.&quot; Containing statistical research gleaned from her interviews, company records, and patterns of familial relationships, the publication argued that industrial settings like the factory failed to cause a breakdown of family structure, a claim that went against prevailing scholarly ideas.

While working on the two publications mentioned above, Hareven strived to expand the boundaries of her research. From 1979 to 1983, she joined forces with anthropologist Kathleen M. Adams to conduct additional oral history interviews with children, spouses, siblings, and parents of former Amoskeag workers. This new project enabled Hareven to continue tracing lifecourse transitions through several generations of the same family. Repeatedly, she determined that the family did not conform blindly to industrial processes, but maintained and used personal ties to adapt the factory environment to their own needs. Hareven published several articles and book chapters related to this research, which were intended to culminate in a sequel to &quot;Family Time and Industrial Time.&quot; This volume was unfinished at the time of her death.

In the early 1980s Hareven was a Fulbright Scholar in Japan. Her travels were motivated by a cross-cultural comparative study to determine whether her findings about New England communities were consistent in other industrial settings around the globe. On her first trip to Japan in 1981, Hareven discovered Nishijin, the silk-weaving district of Kyoto, Japan, which would consume her research for the next ten years. In addition to conducting extensive oral history interviews with Japanese silk weavers, Hareven immersed herself in Japanese culture during her visits. She also guest lectured at Doshisha University in Kyoto. Her research in Japan led to her last book, &quot;The Silk Weavers of Kyoto: Family and Work in a Changing traditional Industry,&quot; which was published after her death in 2002.

In 1988 Hareven left Clark University to accept a position as professor in the Individual and Family Studies department at the University of Delaware. Hareven&#x27;s papers are held today at the University of Delaware.

<text>Forever is the third and final studio album by English girl group the Spice Girls, released on 1 November 2000 by Virgin Records. It is their only album without Geri Halliwell, who later rejoined the group for their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album in 2007.

&quot;Forever&quot; peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the group&#x27;s only studio album to not top the UK charts. It was later certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The album also only reached number 39 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Worldwide the album has sold over two million copies, a commercial disappointment compared to their two previous albums &quot;Spice&quot; and &quot;Spiceworld&quot;. 

The lead and only single, the double A-side &quot;Holler&quot; and &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot;, went on to debut at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the group&#x27;s ninth number one single. Their 1998 Christmas single &quot;Goodbye&quot;, released almost two years earlier, was also included on the album as the closer. &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, &quot;Weekend Love&quot;, and &quot;If You Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; were released as promotional singles from the album, with the latter having a montage music video released exclusively to European music stations.

==Background==
During the Spiceworld Tour in early 1998, the group took on an initial project to write and record songs for a possible third album and a live album. The original concept for this album was to showcase solo songs, duets, and cover songs featuring all five members, in order to promote the idea that the Spice Girls were all individuals, yet could come together as one. The girls went to Dublin&#x27;s Windmill Lane Studios with longtime collaborators Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe to work on a new album and create master recordings for a live album. With the sudden departure of Geri Halliwell, the project took a major turn, with many of the already produced songs scrapped and the live album cancelled.

The Spice Girls recorded their Christmas single, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, in July 1998, during the North American leg of their Spiceworld Tour. Once again, the girls teamed up with Stannard and Rowe. The following year, they recorded &quot;My Strongest Suit&quot; for the concept album for the musical &quot;Aida&quot;. In the two years between the release of &quot;Goodbye&quot; in December 1998 and the release of &quot;Forever&quot; in November 2000, the group, along with the pop-music landscape in general, changed dramatically. Hoping to cultivate a more mature image, the group teamed up with a team of American producers to give &quot;Forever&quot; a more R&amp;B sound. However, initial recording sessions maintained the pop sound of their previous works.

==Recording==
Recording for the album initially began in mid-1999, and the first tracks recorded for the album were recorded at Abbey Road Studios with Stannard and Rowe. The group continued working on tracks through August and September, working on tracks with Eliot Kennedy at Steelworks Studios and tracks with Rodney Jerkins and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis at Whitfield Street Studios respectively. Following these sessions, work on the album was put on a pause. Melanie Chisholm began promoting her first solo album &quot;Northern Star,&quot; released in October, and the group began preparations for the Christmas in Spiceworld tour, in which they premiered the tracks &quot;Right Back At Ya&quot;, &quot;W.O.M.A.N.&quot; and &quot;Holler&quot;. Following the tour, Chisholm continued to promote &quot;Northern Star&quot;, and the other members worked on preparing their own solo material. Recording for the album did not resume until April 2000, when further tracks were recorded with Jerkins in Miami, followed by the final recording session on 17 July 2000.

Sessions with Stannard and Rowe were eventually scrapped from the album, and Kennedy&#x27;s only surviving contribution to the album was &quot;Right Back at Ya&quot;, included on the album in a re-recorded, remixed, R&amp;B form that Kennedy described as a &quot;plodding, boring, bottom drawer R&amp;B song&quot;. In an interview with biographer David Sinclair, Stannard relayed his disappointment in the omission of &quot;W.O.M.A.N.&quot;: &quot;I thought that song was really interesting lyrically, because it was making the progression from girls to women, which was something Matt and I thought it was time for them to do. They needed something to suggest that they were still the same group of friends, but they were gaining more maturity.&quot; Bunton explained that the song was not included because &quot;the sound [had] moved on&quot; in the time since it was recorded.

==Release and promotion==
In August 2000, the album&#x27;s title was revealed through a poll on the group&#x27;s official website, in which fans voted for what they thought the title would be. The album&#x27;s cover has the girls &quot;clinging to each other as if they were holding on for dear life&quot;, according to &quot;PopMatters&quot;″s Peter Piatkowski.

EMI Music Japan first released &quot;Forever&quot; in Japan on 1 November 2000, with a remix of &quot;Holler&quot; serving as a bonus track. It was distributed five days later in the United Kingdom by Virgin Records and on 7 November in North America by EMI. The album leaked on Napster a week prior to its release.

To promote &quot;Forever&quot;, the Spice Girls performed &quot;Holler&quot; and &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; on British televised shows such as &quot;The National Lottery Stars&quot;, &quot;SMTV Live&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The group also gave a performance &quot;Holler&quot; at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards on 16 November 2000 in Stockholm, Sweden; before the performance, Chisholm declared that it would be their last appearance together before going on a hiatus to focus on their solo careers. During the performance, the group wore leather outfits, ending with them going through the floor with large orange pyrotechnic flames blazing up. Additionally, the band&#x27;s members hosted &quot;TFI Friday&quot; on 10 November, as part of the album&#x27;s promotion.

In October 2000, Melanie Brown mentioned that a tour to promote &quot;Forever&quot; would take place in late 2001 and that it would be global, including dates in America. However, the tour never came to fruition due to their solo projects.

The Spice Girls did not heavily promote &quot;Forever&quot; as much as their previous albums, and the promotional campaign was ceased in December 2000 as the group went on an indefinite hiatus. The following month, group member Emma Bunton officially stated that &quot;the record seems to have come to a natural end. I want to concentrate on solo projects and there is no time to release a single now. All our individual projects are scheduled and we wouldn&#x27;t have time for any promotion.&quot;

=== Singles === 
&quot;Holler&quot; and &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; were chosen to serve as the official lead single from &quot;Forever&quot;. Released as a double A-side single, it was released commercially in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2000 as a CD and cassette single. It debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart and became the Spice Girls&#x27; ninth number-one single in the United Kingdom, tying with ABBA as the group with the most singles to reach the top of the charts, only behind The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard and Madonna overall. It also peaked in the top 10 in several other countries in Europe, including Denmark, Ireland, Italy and Spain. In Canada, the songs were released separately; &quot;Holler&quot; reached number two, whereas &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; peaked at number five on the chart compiled by Nielsen Soundscan. The music videos released for the tracks depicted the girls playing one of the four elements each.

On 18 October 2000, Emma Bunton revealed that the group would not be releasing a Christmas single that year. The following January, she confirmed that no further singles would be released from the album. &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, &quot;Weekend Love&quot;, and &quot;If You Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; were released as promotional singles in November 2000. An official promotional montage video was released for &quot;If You Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; the same month which was compiled from previously released footage. &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; had several commissioned remixes, only one of which was commercially released as a bonus track seven years later on the deluxe edition of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. The final promotional push for the &quot;Forever&quot; album was a promotional single featuring these remixes that was released in Australia in the summer of 2001 as a competition prize in a cross-promotion with &quot;TV Hits Magazine&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Forever&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 45, based on nine reviews. In a mixed review, James Hunter of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; expressed that &quot;&quot;Forever&quot; will probably provoke a reaction somewhere in the middle—with one exception, it&#x27;s just OK.&quot; Music critics had ambivalent opinions on the record&#x27;s change in sound compared to the group&#x27;s previous releases. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that on &quot;Forever&quot;, the Spice Girls &quot;make all the right moves, hiring superstar producer Rodney Jerkins to helm most of the tracks and attempting to seem mature, but this all results in a record that is curiously self-conscious and flat&quot;. Andrew Lynch from entertainment.ie opined, &quot;The production is as slick as ever, but a huge part of that old Girl Power enthusiasm seems to have drained and fallen away—and with it most of the fun that used to redeem their fundamental tackiness.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented, &quot;Every genre cliché, from homogenized harmonies to delicately plucked stringed instruments to male rapper interjections, is securely in place. The music is so tasteful, restrained, and assembly line proficient that it makes early singles like &#x27;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&#x27; sound like the rawest punk rock.&quot; Betty Clarke of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave &quot;Forever&quot; a negative review, stating it &quot;ultimately makes you yearn for those heady dans when the Spice Girls were pop and proud of it.&quot;

Other reviews were more positive of the album&#x27;s production. Michael Paoletta of &quot;Billboard&quot; gave the album a positive review, stating it &quot;oozes with timely funk beats and the kind of well-crafted songs that No. 1 hits are made of.&quot; In a positive review, Stephanie McGrath from &quot;Jam!&quot; wrote that the album was the group&#x27;s attempt at &quot;toning down their former flashiness and giving their catchy brand of pop music a sophisticated twist.&quot; She wrote that the group sounded &quot;more comfortable&quot; with the album&#x27;s style and described it as being &quot;full of good pop music.&quot; Natalie Nichols from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the vocals on the album as an improvement over those on its predecessor, writing that &quot;the girls muster more vocal passion and authority&quot; when compared to &quot;Spiceworld&quot;. A review from The Sonic Net wrote that the album sounded &quot;very professional&quot; but also wrote that &quot;only a hardcore fan can deny that the bloom is definitely off the rose.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Forever&quot; debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart with 71,000 copies sold in its first week, behind Westlife&#x27;s &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;. The album spent a total of 10 weeks on the chart. It was certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 17 November 2000, denoting shipments in excess of 300,000 copies. In the United States, the album debuted at number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 34,000 copies in its first week. It spent seven weeks on the chart. By July 2006, it had sold 207,000 copies in the US.

In Australia, it peaked at number nine, and was certified Gold. The album reached number 10 in Austria, and was also certified Gold. In Canada, it peaked at number six and was certified double Platinum, the highest certification achieved for &quot;Forever&quot;. The album also peaked at number six in Germany, and was certified Gold. In Ireland, it peaked at number 15. The album reached number 25 on the charts in New Zealand, where it was certified Gold. In Switzerland, it peaked at number 11 and was certified Platinum. As of January 2001, &quot;Forever&quot; had sold two million copies worldwide.

<text>Vincent Lo Hong-sui, GBM, GBS, JP (; born 18 April 1948) is a Hong Kong businessman. He is the chairman of Hong Kong–based Shui On Group, a building-materials and construction firm. He graduated from the University of New South Wales, Australia, in 1969. Upon returning to Hong Kong, started business with the sum of HK$100,000 (US$16,700) borrowed from his father, Hong Kong property tycoon Lo Ying-shek.

In 1984, Lo began investing in Shanghai and constructed a hotel in partnership with the Communist Youth League. The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre caused occupancy to plunge, and the league could not repay its construction loan. Lo assisted the league in dealing with the loan: Han Zheng was the Youth League secretary at the time, and is now mayor of Shanghai.

He was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal (GBM) by the Hong Kong SAR Government in 2017.

==Family==
Vincent Lo married his ex-wife Jean Ho (何晶潔) in 1985, they had two children together.

Vincent Lo and his current wife Loletta Chu married on 27 November 2008.

<doc id="1229336" wikidata="Q3149777" url="?curid=1229336" title="Inagaki Manjirō">
<text>was a Japanese diplomat and political theorist who was active during the Meiji period of Japan.

== Early life ==
Inagaki was born in Nagasaki, as the son of a &quot;samurai&quot; of the Hirado Domain. As a young man he was a warder of the Satsuma men imprisoned in Nagasaki after the unsuccessful Satsuma Rebellion and gained their respect and affection.

After studying at the clan-established &quot;Ishinkan&quot; and &quot;Kagoshima Shigakko&quot; (private school), he entered the Department of Literature of the Tokyo Imperial University in 1882. Sent down from Tokyo University with many others after the Incident of 1883, when the student body rebelled and boycotted the graduation ceremonies because the time of the ceremony was changed, he never returned, unlike most of the others. Instead, Inagaki went to Britain from January 1888 to December 1890 and studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He also founded the Japanese Club at Cambridge University to study the ways of English gentlemen. He also studied classical literature and is the first Japanese known to have learned Greek. He became a very popular figure at the University, especially with the Master of Pembroke College and the Vice-Chancellor, the Reverend Dr. Charles Edward Searle.

== Later life ==
After graduating Inagaki returned to Japan, and became a temporary professor at Gakushuin Higher Commercial School. He entered the Foreign Ministry and became Japan&#x27;s first deputy Minister Resident to the Kingdom of Siam on March 31, 1897. He was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary on 19 November 1899 and envoy extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in 1903. He continued in that role until July 1907, when he was transferred to Madrid, Spain, where he died of illness in 1908.

Inagaki wrote a number of scholarly books in English and Japanese on international affairs but died relatively young with his potential unfulfilled. His writings urging Japanese expansionism into the South Pacific were part of the theoretical basis of the Southern Expansion Doctrine of the Imperial Japanese Navy and certain factions in the government in the early 20th century.

== Writings ==

* &quot;Japan and the Pacific and the Japanese View of the Eastern Question&quot;, 1890 (London: T. Fisher Unwin) - dedicated to John Robert Seeley who taught Inagaki at Gonville and Caius College.

<text>Project G.e.e.K.e.R. is an animated television series that premiered on CBS on September 14, 1996. It was created by Douglas TenNapel, creator of &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, and Doug Langdale, the developer of &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; the animated series, and was a production of Columbia TriStar Television under Adelaide Productions, with original music by Shawn Patterson and the main title theme composed by Terry Scott Taylor. TenNapel and Taylor also collaborated on the video games &quot;The Neverhood&quot;, &quot;Boombots&quot; and &quot;Skullmonkeys&quot;, and in 2005, re-united for the Nickelodeon cartoon &quot;Catscratch&quot;.

The show was cancelled after only one season, as CBS cancelled all of their Saturday morning schedule in 1997 to stop their downward-spiraling ratings.

The Federal Communications Commission also rejected CBS&#x27;s attempt to classify the show as educational and informational under that fall&#x27;s strengthened requirements for children&#x27;s programming.

==Synopsis==
The titular character, Project GKR (Geno-Kinetic Research), is an artificial shapeshifting being created by Mister Moloch and Dr. Maston of Moloch Industries and intended to be used as a weapon. However, the cyborg Lady MacBeth and her &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; companion Noah rescue him before he can be finished, leaving him a moronic, cartoonish being with little control of his powers. Subsequently, the three must work together to evade capture and prevent Moloch from re-obtaining GeeKeR.

== Music ==
Terry Scott Taylor (friend of creator Doug TenNapel) was contracted to write the main title theme for the show, while Shawn Patterson was selected to be the series score composer. Two days before the show was set to air, Columbia TriStar discovered a licensing issue with Terry and Patterson was asked by the producers to compose and produce a main title theme to go on the air. Shawn completed this and Project GeeKeR aired with Shawn&#x27;s original main title music. Weeks into the series, the licensing problem with Terry Scott Taylor was cleared up and the show&#x27;s creator Doug TenNapel requested that Terry&#x27;s original main title theme be reinserted into the series. Patterson&#x27;s main title music was then removed from the remainder of the series.

<doc id="1229351" wikidata="Q13912" url="?curid=1229351" title="Where the Wild Things Are">
<text>Where the Wild Things Are is a 1963 children&#x27;s picture book written and illustrated by American author and illustrator, Maurice Sendak, originally published in hardcover by Harper &amp; Row. The book has been adapted into other media several times, including an animated short film in 1973 (with an updated version in 1988); a 1980 opera; and a live-action 2009 feature-film adaptation. The book had sold over 19 million copies worldwide as of 2009, with 10 million of those being in the United States.

Sendak won the annual Caldecott Medal from the children&#x27;s librarians in 1964, recognizing &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; as the previous year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished American picture book for children&quot;. It was voted the number one picture book in a 2012 survey of &quot;School Library Journal&quot; readers, not for the first time.

==Plot==
The story focuses on a young boy named Max who, after dressing in his wolf suit, wreaks such havoc through his household that he is sent to bed without his supper. Max&#x27;s bedroom undergoes a mysterious transformation into a jungle environment, and he winds up sailing to an island inhabited by monsters, simply called the Wild Things. The Wild Things try to scare Max, but to no avail. After stopping and intimidating the creatures, Max is hailed as the king of the Wild Things and enjoys a playful romp with his subjects. Finally, Max stops them and sends them to bed without their supper. However, to the Wild Things&#x27; dismay, he starts to feel lonely and decides to abdicate and return home. The creatures do not want Max to go and throw themselves into fits of rage as he calmly sails away home. Upon returning to his bedroom, Max discovers a hot supper waiting for him.

==Development==
Sendak began his career as an illustrator, but by the mid-1950s, Sendak had decided to start both writing and illustrating his own books. In 1956, he published his first book for which he was the sole author, &quot;Kenny&#x27;s Window&quot; (1956). Soon after, Sendak began work on another solo effort. The story was supposed to be that of a child who, after a tantrum, is punished in his room and decides to escape to the place that gives the book its title, the &quot;land of wild horses&quot;. Shortly before starting the illustrations, Sendak realized that he did not know how to draw horses and, at the suggestion of his editor, changed the wild horses to the more ambiguous &quot;Wild Things&quot;, a term inspired by the Yiddish expression &quot;vilde chaya&quot; (&quot;wild animals&quot;), used to indicate boisterous children.

Sendak replaced the horses with caricatures of his aunts and uncles, caricatures that he had originally drawn in his youth as an escape from their chaotic weekly visits, on Sunday afternoons, to his family&#x27;s Brooklyn home. Sendak, as a child, had observed his relatives as being &quot;all crazy – crazy faces and wild eyes&quot;, with blood-stained eyes and &quot;big and yellow&quot; teeth, who pinched his cheeks until they were red. These relatives, like Sendak&#x27;s parents, were poor Jewish immigrants from Poland, whose remaining family in Nazi-occupied Europe were killed during the Holocaust while Sendak was in his early teens. As a child, however, he saw them only as &quot;grotesques&quot;.

When working on the 1983 opera adaptation of the book with Oliver Knussen, Sendak gave the monsters the names of his relatives: Tzippy, Moishe, Aaron, Emile, and Bernard.

==Literary significance==
=== Analysis ===
In Selma G. Lanes&#x27;s book &quot;The Art of Maurice Sendak&quot;, Sendak discusses &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; along with his other books &quot;In the Night Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Outside Over There&quot; as a trilogy centered on children&#x27;s growth, survival, and fury. He indicated that the three books are &quot;all variations on the same theme: how children master various feelings – danger, boredom, fear, frustration, jealousy – and manage to come to grips with the realities of their lives&quot;. Fundamental to Sendak&#x27;s work for over fifty years is his trust in the validity of children&#x27;s emotions.

Dr. Kara Keeling and Dr. Scott Pollard, both English professors, assess the role that food plays in the book, arguing that food is a metaphor for Max&#x27;s mother&#x27;s love based on the idea that Max comes home to a &quot;still hot&quot; supper, which suggests that his mother &quot;loves him best&quot;. Going along with this, Mary Pols of &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;[w]hat makes Sendak&#x27;s book so compelling is its grounding effect: Max has a tantrum and in a flight of fancy visits his wild side, but he is pulled back by a belief in parental love to a supper &#x27;still hot&#x27;, balancing the seesaw of fear and comfort&quot;.

&quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; is a story that shows children&#x27;s resilience through their &quot;spirit&quot; and &quot;pluck&quot;. Max is able to stand up to the Wild Things with their &quot;terrible teeth&quot; and &quot;terrible claws&quot; using &quot;the magic trick of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once&quot;.

Professor Liam Heneghan describes Max&#x27;s dream as one of mastering the wild, from which he also learns to master his &quot;inner tumult&quot;. It sets forth the unrestrained rowdiness of the Wild Things and enlightens the reader to the idea that one cannot live in the wild forever. In her words: &quot;In this notion of wilderness, there is a heightened reminder that after our fill of wilderness, one can, or perhaps even should, return, replenished, to the comforts of home&quot;. Heneghan concludes that &quot;the overarching thought is an old one: a human engages with Wild Things and in so doing comes into accord with the world and gains a measure of self-mastery&quot;.

=== Reception ===
&quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; has received high critical acclaim. Francis Spufford suggests that the book is &quot;one of the very few picture books to make an entirely deliberate and beautiful use of the psychoanalytic story of anger&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; film critic Manohla Dargis noted that &quot;there are different ways to read the wild things, through a Freudian or colonialist prism, and probably as many ways to ruin this delicate story of a solitary child liberated by his imagination&quot;. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. Five years later, &quot;School Library Journal&quot; sponsored a survey of readers which identified &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; as a top picture book. Elizabeth Bird, the librarian from the New York Public Library who conducted the survey, observed that there was little doubt that it would be voted number one and highlighted its designation by one reader as a watershed, &quot;ushering in the modern age of picture books&quot;. Another critic called it &quot;perfectly crafted, perfectly illustrated ... simply the epitome of a picture book&quot; and noted that Sendak &quot;rises above the rest in part because he is subversive&quot;. President Barack Obama read it aloud for children who were attending the White House Easter Egg Roll in multiple years.

&quot;New York Times&quot; writer Bruce Handy brought up the idea that &quot;as a child myself, without benefit of personal insights subsequently gleaned from more than a decade of talk therapy, I had been left cold by &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;&quot;. Deborah Stevenson, a writer for &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot;, talks about the effects the book had on a child who &quot;screamed, apparently not with delight, every time &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; was read to him. It is quite possible for some young readers or listeners to be moved to alarm by a book, just as they can be moved to joy or excitement or boredom&quot;. Sendak responded to this criticism in an interview, asking: &quot;Did she hate her kid? Is that why she was tormenting her with this book?&quot;

Despite the book&#x27;s popularity, Sendak refused to produce a sequel; four months before his death in 2012, he told comedian Stephen Colbert that a sequel would be &quot;the most boring idea imaginable&quot;. &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; was number four on the list of &quot;Top Check Outs OF ALL TIME&quot; by the New York Public Library.

==Adaptations==
An animated short adaptation which had taken five years to complete was released in 1973, directed and animated by Gene Deitch and produced at Krátký film, Prague, for Weston Woods. It had narration by Allen Swift and a musique concrète score composed by Deitch himself; an updated version, which featured a new musical score and narration both by Peter Schickele, was released in 1988. This revised version was featured in a Children&#x27;s Circle video titled &quot;The Maurice Sendak Library&quot;.

In the 1980s, Sendak worked with British composer Oliver Knussen on a children&#x27;s opera based upon the book. The opera received its first (incomplete) performance in Brussels in 1980; the first complete performance of the final version was given by the Glyndebourne Touring Opera in London in 1984. This was followed by its first U.S. performance in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1985 and the New York City premiere by New York City Opera in 1987. A concert performance was given at The Proms in the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2002. A concert production was produced by New York City Opera in spring 2011.

In 1981, the New England Dinosaur Dance Company turned the book into a dance piece with choreography by Toby Armour and music by Ezra Sims. The piece debuted at Boston&#x27;s Wilbur Theatre on December 22, 1981.

In 1983, Walt Disney Productions conducted a series of tests of computer-generated imagery created by Glen Keane and John Lasseter using as their subject &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;.

In 1999, Isadar released a solo piano musical composition titled &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; which appeared on his album &quot;Active Imagination&quot;, inspired by the Sendak book. The composition was revisited and re-recorded in 2012 on Isadar&#x27;s album, &quot;Reconstructed&quot;, with Grammy winner and founder of Windham Hill Records, William Ackerman, producing.

In 2002, the BBC produced a radio adaptation of the book, as part of their &#x27;An Abominable Bestiary&#x27; series.

The 2005 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode, &quot;The Girl Who Slept Too Little&quot;, features a spoof of &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; entitled &quot;The Land of the Wild Beasts&quot;.

A live-action film version of the book was released on October 16, 2009. Directed by Spike Jonze and co-produced by Sendak, the film stars Max Records as Max and features Catherine Keener as his mother, with Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, Paul Dano, James Gandolfini, Catherine O&#x27;Hara and Forest Whitaker providing the voices of the principal Wild Things. The soundtrack was written and produced by Karen O and Carter Burwell. The screenplay was adapted by Jonze in collaboration with Dave Eggers, who also novelized the screenplay as &quot;The Wild Things&quot;, published in 2009.

In 2012, indie rock quartet alt-J released the song &quot;Breezeblocks&quot;, inspired in part by the book. Alt-J keyboardist Gus Unger-Hamilton said the story and the song share similar ideas about parting with a loved one. &quot;Breezeblocks&quot; reached certified ARIA Gold status in Australia.

In 2016, Alessia Cara released her second single, &quot;Wild Things&quot;, which charted at number fifty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In an interview with ABC News Radio, Cara stated she took inspiration from &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, saying &quot;each &#x27;Thing&#x27; represents an emotion and kinda escapes into this world ... and that&#x27;s kinda what I wanted to do&quot;.

<text>Thomas Wilton Billington (5 December 1958 – 5 December 2018), best known by the ring name the Dynamite Kid, was a British professional wrestler.

Trained by former wrestler &quot;Dr Death&quot; Ted Betley, he competed in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Stampede Wrestling, All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). With his cousin Davey Boy Smith, he was also known for being one half of the tag team The British Bulldogs.

He had notable feuds with Tiger Mask in Japan and Bret Hart in Canada.

Billington is considered by many, including Bret Hart, to have been one of wrestling&#x27;s most influential in-ring performers, having increased the level of athleticism involved in the art, bringing together styles from Britain, Mexico, Canada and Japan.

==Early life==
Billington was born on 5 December 1958 in Golborne, Lancashire, near Manchester. He had two sisters and a younger brother named Mark. His father Bill and uncle Eric Billington were boxers in their youth and his grandfather Thomas Billington was a bare-knuckle boxer. He was a member of the Billington family. One of his ancestors James Billington was also a wrestler.

Academic work was not a priority to him, but he was drawn to sports at his comprehensive school; his adherence to it, particularly wrestling and gymnastics, helped him develop a relatively small but powerful and agile shape. In addition, he had also received training in boxing during his formative years, which helped instill toughness in him before his career.

==Professional wrestling career==

=== Early career (1975–1984) ===
Billington was trained by former wrestler &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Ted Betley after a meeting at his father’s workplace introduced the two. He trained with Betley for three years starting at 13, and attended Riley&#x27;s Gym, known as The Snake Pit, where he learned freestyle wrestling. Dynamite Kid made his debut working in 1975 for Max Crabtree. Kid&#x27;s first match filmed for TV was taped 30 June 1976 in Lincoln (and transmitted 30 October by which time another match against Pete Meredith had been filmed and screened) saw him lose by technical knockout to veteran heel &quot;Strongman&quot; Alan Dennison after injuring his throat on the top ring rope. However, Dennison was so impressed by the technical skill of his young opponent that he refused the win and consequently changed his ways and became a blue-eye and a friend of Kid.

During his early days, he won the British Lightweight title on 23 April 1977, and the Welterweight title on 25 January 1978. He was also instrumental in starting the career of then-Judo star Chris Adams while still competing in the UK, was scouted and moved to Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1978. He would make occasional home visits over the next few years, including challenging World Heavyweight Middleweight Champion Rollerball Rocco in a televised title match ending in a double knockout.

Dynamite made a big impact in his matches for Stampede Wrestling with the increasingly popular Bruce Hart and rookie Bret Hart. Despite differences between them due to comments Dynamite Kid made about Stu Hart in his autobiography, Bret still regards him as &quot;pound-for-pound, the greatest wrestler who ever lived.&quot; Dynamite Kid began taking steroids in 1979, when Big Daddy Ritter, aka the Junkyard Dog, introduced Billington to the anabolic steroid Dianabol. Billington was also introduced to speed during his stay in Canada by Jake Roberts.

After doing big business in Canada, Dynamite was booked on his first tour of Japan, working for International Wrestling Enterprise from 19 to 25 July 1979. Stu Hart and Stampede Wrestling switched their business relationship from IWE to New Japan Pro-Wrestling shortly after Dynamite&#x27;s first tour, and he wrestled for New Japan from 4 January 1980 to 2 August 1984. Perhaps the most memorable matches that came out of Dynamite&#x27;s run in New Japan were from his now legendary feud against Tiger Mask; Tiger Mask&#x27;s debut was against Dynamite, in which Tiger Mask shocked the wrestling world by gaining the victory over Dynamite. The two would compete against one another several more times in a feud that is often credited as putting Junior Heavyweight wrestling on the map, as well as setting the standard for future generations. Both the NWA and WWF Junior Heavyweight titles were vacated after Tiger Mask was injured by Dynamite Kid in a tag match on 1 April 1983. Dynamite and Kuniaki Kobayashi competed for the vacant titles, but no winner was decided. On 21 April 1983, Dynamite and Tiger Mask met for the vacant WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship, but no winner was decided after the match ended up as a draw three consecutive times.

In 1983, Kid made his debut to the United States working for Pacific Northwest Wrestling where he feuded with Curt Hennig. Eventually he won the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight title from Hennig on 7 September. A month later he dropped the title from Billy Jack Haynes. Then in November he teamed up with The Assassin and won the Pacific Northwest Tag titles from Curt Hennig and Buddy Rose. A month later they dropped the belts to Hennig and Scott McGhee.

On 7 February 1984, Billington captured the WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship by winning a tournament in New Japan Pro-Wrestling; although it was a WWF Title, it was primarily defended in Japan. He defeated Davey Boy Smith earlier in the tournament and would go on to defeat The Cobra in the finals.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1984–1988) ===
Dynamite Kid made his WWF television debut on 29 August 1984, where he and Bret Hart defeated Iron Mike Sharpe and Troy Alexander in a match eventually shown on 15 September 1984, on the Maple Leaf Garden broadcast. In 1985, Billington would end up teaming with Davey Boy Smith as the British Bulldogs, while Bret would turn heel and team with Jim Neidhart as The Hart Foundation, and it led to matches between the two teams that usually ended in No-Contests. On 7 April 1986, accompanied by Captain Lou Albano and Ozzy Osbourne, the British Bulldogs won the WWF World tag team title from Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake at WrestleMania II.

Dynamite Kid would suffer a serious injury in a tag-team match that took place in December 1986 in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, against Don Muraco and Bob Orton, Jr. and several wrestlers including Roddy Piper, Junkyard Dog and Billy Jack Haynes would substitute for him when tag title defenses were made. While recovering in the hospital from back surgery, Billington would later recount that Bret Hart showed up and stated that Vince McMahon had sent him to get Dynamite&#x27;s tag belt; Billington refused. Shortly after checking himself out of the hospital (against doctors&#x27; orders), Billington met with McMahon, who requested that the Bulldogs drop the tag titles to the team of The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff; Billington refused, saying that he would only drop the belts to The Hart Foundation.

McMahon acquiesced and at a TV taping on 26 January 1987, The British Bulldogs wrestled a match to drop the titles to The Hart Foundation; the match would air on 7 February edition of &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot;. The match itself was an odd sight, as Dynamite could barely walk due to back surgery. Dynamite was knocked out by Jimmy Hart&#x27;s megaphone early in the match, avoiding him having to wrestle much in the match for story purposes. From that point forward, the Bulldogs would not be a top-tier team anymore, and while they would not become straight jobbers, they would mostly wrestle to double disqualifications, double countouts or time-limit draws against the top teams in the WWF.

Billington was known for being a tough guy and for his stiffness as a worker. Mick Foley reported that, when he and Les Thornton (another British wrestler) wrestled the Bulldogs in a tag-team match early in Foley&#x27;s career, Billington manhandled him so badly in the ring that he tore a ligament in Foley&#x27;s jaw with his signature Hook Clothesline, preventing Foley from eating solid food until his recovery. Outside of the ring, WWF-champion Randy Savage once specifically asked for him to watch his back when he went drinking in a hotel bar frequented by NWA wrestlers, including Ric Flair. He was also involved in heated backstage fights with Jacques Rougeau, one of which led to Rougeau hitting him with a fistful of quarters as he opened a door holding a cup of coffee, knocking several of his teeth out. Billington claimed the Rougeau incident was not the final straw that drove him to leave the WWF, but rather a dispute with WWF management over the issuance of complimentary plane tickets, over which he resigned from the company on principle and which to his surprise in retrospect, Smith followed suit.

The Bulldogs wrestled their last WWF match at the 1988 Survivor Series. Although their team would win the match after team captains The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord) eliminated the last remaining opponents The Conquistadores, the Bulldogs had earlier been eliminated when Billington had been pinned by Smash of the tag team champions Demolition.

===Return to Stampede Wrestling, England and Japan (1988–1996)===
After leaving the WWF, the Bulldogs returned to Stampede Wrestling to win the International Tag Team Titles. The Bulldogs also competed frequently in All-Japan Pro Wrestling where they were paid $20,000 each by Giant Baba, along with the liberty of choosing which tours they wanted to participate in. Upon returning to Stampede, the Bulldogs were involved in a feud with Karachi Vice over the Stampede International Tag Team Championship. However, by February 1989, Dynamite became involved in a brutal feud with Johnny Smith after Johnny interfered and attacked the Dynamite Kid, before cutting his hair. In May 1989, the Bulldogs split up in Stampede, but remained a team in AJPW. Over in Stampede, the Bulldogs feuded with each other, with Dynamite forming The British Bruisers with Johnny Smith and Davey Boy Smith teaming with a young Chris Benoit.

In 1990, Davey Boy Smith abruptly withdrew the Bulldogs from AJPW&#x27;s annual World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League by returning to the WWF, and fabricating a story to the All-Japan office that Billington was in a serious car accident and was unable to compete. Back home in the UK, from 1991 onward, he would regularly appear for local promotions All Star Wrestling and Orig Williams&#x27; BWF where, due to his WWF success, he was a headline attraction this time around. Since Davey Boy Smith had trademarked the term &quot;The British Bulldog&quot; during the Bulldogs&#x27; previous run in WWF, he decided to return to the WWF as The British Bulldog and would send people to the United Kingdom to warn the promoter every time a flyer was distributed promoting Dynamite Kid as a &quot;British Bulldog&quot;.

Johnny Smith would end up taking Davey Boy Smith&#x27;s spot in the World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League, and the duo (known as the British Bruisers) continued to compete in All Japan Pro Wrestling. The duo managed to capture the All Asia Tag Team Championship, but the partnership was short-lived; the years of steroid abuse (including an incident in which he used horse steroids), working a high impact style, and cocaine usage caught up with Billington as he suddenly announced his retirement on 6 December 1991, immediately after the Bruisers defeated Johnny Ace and Sunny Beach at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo. He returned to Japan as a special guest with Lord James Blears on 28 February 1993 and claimed that he was going to send his 17-year-old brother to All Japan&#x27;s Dojo, but it was not realized. He returned again for a tag team match with Johnny Smith on 28 July 1993 and was planning to promote an All-Japan show in his country in 1994, but it was not realized either.

In January 1994, he returned to England and worked again for All Star Wrestling.

Before embarking on another All-Japan tour, he visited Dan Spivey and stayed in his home in Florida for a week, while Spivey went on holiday. When Spivey came back, he and Billington took hits of LSD, which resulted in Billington coming close to death twice in one day, but he was revived with adrenaline shots by paramedics both times.

His final wrestling match took place on 10 October 1996, at a Michinoku Pro event called &quot;These Days&quot;. The match was promoted as a &quot;Legends of High-Flying&quot; six-man tag featuring Dynamite paired with Dos Caras and Kuniaki Kobayashi against the Great Sasuke, Mil Máscaras, and Tiger Mask. Dynamite&#x27;s body had degenerated to the point where he was &quot;practically skin and bones&quot;, as the bottom portion of his tights were very loose. In the end, Dynamite delivered his trademark tombstone piledriver on Great Sasuke, leading Dos Caras to powerbomb Sasuke for the pin. While at the airport to return home on the next day, Dynamite had a second seizure (the first one was in 1987) and was sent to the hospital immediately.

==Personal life==
In 1991, he was divorced from his first wife Michelle Smadu (the sister of Bret Hart&#x27;s then-wife Julie), with whom Billington had one son and two daughters (Marek, Bronwyne and Amaris). Following the end of his marriage to Michelle, he moved from Canada back home to Golborne with his parents. There he married for a second time to a woman named Dot; with her he had three stepsons; John, Steven and Mark. Dot died on 9 July 2024. Before his death Billington had two granddaughters, Miami and Taya. He is now survived by two more grandchildren, Madix and Harlow.

Billington was a close friend of Wayne Hart. When Billington was living in Calgary, they co-owned an apartment together where they lived with their respective girlfriends.

===Altercations with other wrestlers===
Billington had several violent interactions with fellow wrestlers. One such event was with Bruce Hart, in which Billington broke Hart&#x27;s jaw. 
Another was while in WWF, where wrestler Jacques Rougeau Jr. felt that Billington had bullied him and punched Billington in the face with a fist holding rolled up quarters, knocking out Billington&#x27;s front teeth.

===Health problems===
In 1997, after having a great deal of complications he was experiencing with walking due to the large number of back and leg injuries he sustained during his career, Billington lost the use of his left leg. Using a wheelchair for mobility, he was cared for by his second wife, Dot. Billington was told he would never be able to walk again. Harley Race, the inventor of the diving headbutt (a move Chris Benoit also used frequently), stated that he regretted ever inventing the move due to its ostensible causation of spinal problems, concussions, and that it may have contributed to Billington&#x27;s disability. In addition to his paralysis, Billington also had heart problems. In November 2013, Billington reportedly had a stroke.

In 2015, he was named in a lawsuit filed by WWE after the organization received a letter from him indicating that he intended to sue them for concussion-based injuries sustained during his affiliation with WWE. He was represented by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who is involved in several other lawsuits involving former WWE wrestlers. Billington&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant in September 2018.

===Death===
Billington died on 5 December 2018, his 60th birthday. The exact cause of death remains unconfirmed, but the BBC report of his death placed it in the context of the above-mentioned health issues. At the time of his death Billington’s siblings stated that his health issues resulted in him being depressed and that he took numerous medications for his health conditions.

==Legacy==
Billington&#x27;s British training, combined with an aerial arsenal honed during numerous tours in Japan, influenced a generation of later wrestling stars, especially those normally associated with Stu Hart&#x27;s &quot;Dungeon&quot;. A follower was Chris Benoit, who idolized Billington while growing up and adopted a similar moveset that included the swandive headbutt and the Snap suplex.

In February 2013, Highspots.com released a documentary named &quot;Dynamite Kid: A Matter of Pride&quot; on the Dynamite Kid.

In October 2014, Billington was presented with a lifetime achievement award at Gloucester Leisure Centre by Superstars of Wrestling UK.

Billington is featured in the 2016 documentary &quot;Nine Legends&quot;.

The playable character &quot;Dynamite Tommy&quot; in the &quot;Mat Mania/Mania Challenge/Exciting Hour&quot; arcade games of the mid-1980s is often presumed to be modeled after Billington. The artwork for the game features the character wearing a championship belt which is quite similar to the WWF Junior Heavyweight Championship which Billington held. 

Billington&#x27;s nephews Thomas and Mark have become professional wrestlers, having been trained by Marty Jones and have formed a tag team, The Billington Bulldogs.

On 16 September 2021, Vice TV aired (as part of their series &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot;) a retrospective of Billington&#x27;s life, both in and out of the ring. Included in that program are interviews with Dynamite&#x27;s widow, daughters, and wrestlers Dan Spivey and WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley.

<doc id="1229360" wikidata="Q5684725" url="?curid=1229360" title="Hawes Junction rail crash">
<text>The Hawes Junction rail crash occurred at 5.49 am on 24 December 1910, just north of Lunds Viaduct between Hawes Junction (now known as Garsdale station) and Aisgill on the Midland Railway&#x27;s Settle and Carlisle main line in the North Riding of Yorkshire (now Cumbria), England. It was caused when a busy signalman, Alfred Sutton, forgot about a pair of light engines waiting at his down (northbound) starting signal to return to their shed at Carlisle. They were still waiting there when the signalman set the road for the down Scotch express. When the signal cleared, the light engines set off in front of the express into the same block section. Since the light engines were travelling at low speed from a stand at Hawes Junction, and the following express was travelling at high speed, a collision was inevitable. The express caught the light engines just after Moorcock Tunnel near Aisgill summit in Mallerstang and was almost wholly derailed.

Casualties were made worse by the telescoping (over-riding) of the timber-bodied coaches, and by fire which broke out in the coaches, fed by the gas for the coaches&#x27; lights leaking from ruptured pipes. Twelve people lost their lives as a result of this accident, some of whom were trapped in the wreckage and were burned to death.

==The accident==
Hawes Junction station was approximately south of Ais Gill summit, the highest point on the steeply graded Settle and Carlisle line. The Midland Railway, who owned and operated the line, had a policy of using small engines only, and many trains (both northbound and southbound) required assistance from pilot engines to climb the &quot;big hump&quot; to Ais Gill summit. At Ais Gill summit the pilot engines were uncoupled and ran on the up (southbound, towards London) line to Hawes Junction, where there was a turntable accessed from the up main line via a trailing slip or from the back platform line (a loop line alongside the up main line which served the branch line to Hawes). Having been turned, light engines were usually coupled together to return to their depots (usually Leeds to the south or Carlisle to the north).

In the hour preceding the accident, signalman Sutton at Hawes Junction had to deal with nine light engines and a heavy load of scheduled traffic and some unscheduled special trains as part of the holiday traffic. At 5:20 am, the last two northbound light engines (rebuilt Midland Railway Class 2 4-4-0 Nos. 448 and 548, under drivers Edwin Scott and George William Bath) had been turned and coupled together, and were waiting on the &quot;lie-bye&quot; road alongside the down (northbound, away from London) line. After a down special express passed, Sutton signalled them onto the down main line where they halted at the advance starting signal, waiting for the express to clear Aisgill. Normally, this took between four and six minutes. However, Scott and Bath were still waiting twenty minutes later.

Sutton had been busy handling two express up goods and trying to dispatch three light engines to the south between them. At 5.39, Sutton was offered the midnight sleeping car express, St.Pancras-Glasgow, which he offered forward to Ais Gill. It was accepted at once and at 5:44 he pulled all his signals &quot;off&quot; i.e. set them to clear. Scott and Bath briefly &quot;popped&quot; their whistles and set off. Barely two minutes later the express passed through. It consisted of four timber-bodied coaches, two sleeping cars and two brake vans, hauled by &quot;Kirtley&quot; 2-4-0 No. 48 and rebuilt Class 2 No. 549, under drivers Richard Johnston Oldcorn and Henry Wadeson. It was running sixteen minutes late due to signal and other delays at Leeds and Skipton, but was running at and accelerating before making the final ascent to Ais Gill.

The two light engines were running at only an easy . They had cleared Moorcock tunnel just over a mile north of Hawes Junction and were running across the Lunds viaduct north of the tunnel when driver Bath glanced back and saw the express as it emerged from the tunnel. He opened his regulator and whistle. At the same time, driver Oldcorn on the leading engine of the express saw the red tail light on Bath&#x27;s tender and applied the express&#x27;s continuous brake. Driver Oldcorn estimated that the distance between the speeding express and the light engine was only , so neither measure had time to take effect, and the express struck the light engines from behind. Bath&#x27;s locomotive was derailed and lost its front bogie, but his and Scott&#x27;s locomotives carried on for over before Bath&#x27;s locomotive came to rest against the side of a cutting. The two locomotives of the express were also derailed, and the coaches piled up behind them. The first two coaches were badly telescoped, and the twelve passengers who died were in these two coaches.

Except for two electrically lit sleeping cars, the coaches were lit by the Pintsch oil gas system. The main gas pipe on the leading coach was broken off in the impact, and the entire contents of the pressurised gas cylinders escaped in under two minutes. The gas then ignited in a single flash. Driver Bath had been injured in the leg but made his way on foot to the Ais Gill signal box a mile and a half north to summon help. The signalman there, Benjamin Bellas, sent another light engine under driver John William Judd, with Bath, along the up line. Judd attempted to put out the fire by bucketing water from his tender. Another light engine had been sent from Hawes Junction and its crew tried to drag the rear coaches away from the fire but could move only the brake vans at the rear of the train. The six leading coaches were immovable. The engine crews and the express train&#x27;s guards, the sleeping car attendants, some platelayers from a hut a short distance up the line and a shepherd whose home was nearby tried desperately to rescue the trapped passengers but were eventually driven back by thick smoke. Because a strong wind was fanning the flames, the fire could not be extinguished and all six coaches were burned out.

The bodies of the dead were taken to the nearby Moorcock Inn. The Board of Trade Inquiry into the crash commenced on 27 December 1910 in the same inn.

The writer John Francon Williams and his son John Jr, were thought to have been passengers on the train but were discovered safe two days after the accident having not caught the train in Manchester as they had intended.

==Causes==
The immediate cause of the accident was that signalman Sutton forgot that he had moved the two light engines to the down line, waiting there to proceed to Carlisle. He later improperly cleared the down line signals without ascertaining that the line was clear.

George Tempest, the driver of another light engine waiting at Hawes Junction to return south to Leeds, witnessed Scott&#x27;s and Bath&#x27;s engines depart followed closely by the express. After he and his fireman heard the whistle of Bath&#x27;s locomotive, he went to the signalbox and related what he had seen. Sutton refused to believe him until he had checked his train register, and then telephoned signalman Bellas at Aisgill to ask whether the two light engines had gone through. Bellas replied that none had been offered to him; nor had the St. Pancras-Glasgow express passed. Sutton had apparently been under the mistaken impression that he had despatched the two light engines to Carlisle some time earlier. By this time, the glare of the fire to the north was visible. Simpson, the signalman sent to relieve Sutton, then arrived for his shift, whereupon Sutton asked him to &quot;go to Bunce [the stationmaster] and tell him I am afraid I have wrecked the Scotch Express&quot;.

==Railway Inspectorate Report==
Since the earliest days of public railways in the UK, railway accidents were investigated by Her Majesty&#x27;s Railway Inspectorate, an independent body of experts, mostly from the Royal Engineers. In the case of the Hawes Junction collision, the investigating officer was Major John Wallace Pringle, who opened a private court of investigation initially operating from the waiting room at Hawes Junction station. He naturally judged that Sutton&#x27;s admitted mistake was the primary cause of the accident, but made a number of observations on the conduct of others and several recommendations.

Pringle considered that drivers Scott and Bath were also at fault for failing to carry out the requirements of Rule 55, which was created to remind signalmen in this situation. Under this rule, they should have sounded their engine whistles on coming to a stop, and when the signal was not cleared they should have sent one of their firemen to the signal box to remind the signalman personally. In 1910, the time after which this should be done was not specified, but was generally accepted to be two or three minutes. The engines were actually detained for twenty minutes. O.S. Nock states that ten minutes was allowed, but does not give a source for this.

Scott and Bath stated that they had sounded their whistles as they moved off, and this was confirmed by Tempest. Sutton had not been alerted by this, probably because the two locomotives were halted at the advanced starting signal from the signal box rather than the much closer home signal, driving rain was being blown against the windows of the box, making it hard to hear sounds outside, and other engines were moving around the station and yard at the same time, so that Sutton would not have attached any particular significance to a train whistle from some distance away.

The issue arose of whether the signalman was overworked. The large number of light engine movements would naturally increase the total amount of traffic at Hawes Junction, but Pringle&#x27;s report specifically rejected the assertion that overwork was a factor. However, between moving the two light engines onto the down line and accepting the express, the signalman had to deal with two up goods trains and several up light engines, movements which would require all his concentration to avoid delay, and make it easy to forget about the down line. The accident also occurred near the end of Sutton&#x27;s 10-hour shift, which would make a lapse of memory easier.

Many railways had adopted reminder appliances, simple mechanical collars that the signalmen were required to place on signal levers to remind them that trains were stopped at signals, as a back-up to prevent them clearing the signals by mistake. The Midland Railway had not adopted these simple devices.

The accident would have been prevented if track circuits had been installed to detect the presence of a train (or in this case the light engines) on the main lines, and interlocking with the signals would have prevented them being cleared by the signalman. Track circuits had been invented in the 1870s and had proved to be very successful; unfortunately most British railway companies were slow to install them. The high level of traffic movements made Hawes Junction a prime location for the use of reminder appliances. The Board of Trade accident report unequivocally recommended this, and the Midland Railway rapidly complied both here and at 900 other locations on their network.

Since the outbreak of the fire and its intensity was undoubtedly caused by escaping gas from the Pintsch lighting system, the report recommended measures such as automatic shut-off valves and safer placement of cylinders. However, Pringle recommended that electricity be adopted as the universal method for lighting coaches, although he allowed that it would take many years for such a change to take effect fully.

<text>Ephraim Hubbard Foster (September 17, 1794September 6, 1854) was an American politician, who twice served as a United States Senator from Tennessee. During his political career, he was a member of the Whig Party.

==Biography==
Foster was born near Bardstown, Kentucky, in Nelson County, the son of Robert Coleman Foster and the former Ann Hubbard. In 1797 he moved with his parents to Tennessee, where they settled in the Nashville area. He later graduated from Cumberland College (1813) and later studied law, being admitted to the bar in 1820. He owned slaves. He also served in the Creek War and was for a time private secretary to General Andrew Jackson.

He was a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1829 to 1831 and again from 1835 to 1837, serving each time as Speaker. Upon the resignation from the U.S. Senate of Felix Grundy to accept appointment as United States Attorney General, the Tennessee General Assembly elected Foster his successor. He served in the Senate for the first time from September 17, 1838, to March 3, 1839. The legislature elected him to continue in the new term, but he declined, refusing to take their instruction in how to vote while a Senator; the legislature then turned to Grundy, still Attorney General, to succeed him, which (controversially) Grundy agreed to do.

However, Grundy died in office about a year later. Alfred O. P. Nicholson agreed to serve on an interim basis; then for a period the seat was vacated entirely, but eventually the legislature agreed to elect Foster again to the seat and he agreed to serve. His second period of service in the Senate was from October 17, 1843, to March 3, 1845. During this time he chaired the Senate Committee on Claims. Later in 1845 Foster received the nomination of the Whig party for Governor of Tennessee, but was defeated in the election by Aaron V. Brown of the Democratic Party. Following this, Foster returned to his Nashville law practice until shortly before his death. He is buried in the old City Cemetery in Nashville.

His only daughter Sallie married Benjamin F. Cockrill, the son of planter Mark R. Cockrill, and they had a son, Benjamin F. Cockrill Jr.

<doc id="1229368" wikidata="Q2298831" url="?curid=1229368" title="Asymmetric relation">
<text>In mathematics, an asymmetric relation is a binary relation formula_1 on a set formula_2 where for all formula_3 if formula_4 is related to formula_5 then formula_5 is &quot;not&quot; related to formula_7

== Formal definition ==

=== Preliminaries ===
A binary relation on formula_2 is any subset formula_1 of formula_10 Given formula_3 write formula_12 if and only if formula_13 which means that formula_12 is shorthand for formula_15 The expression formula_12 is read as &quot;formula_4 is related to formula_5 by formula_19&quot;

=== Definition ===

The binary relation formula_1 is called if for all formula_3 if formula_12 is true then formula_23 is false; that is, if formula_24 then formula_25 
This can be written in the notation of first-order logic as
formula_26
A logically equivalent definition is:
:for all formula_3 at least one of formula_12 and formula_23 is ,
which in first-order logic can be written as:
formula_30
A relation is asymmetric if and only if it is both antisymmetric and irreflexive, so this may also be taken as a definition.

== Examples ==

An example of an asymmetric relation is the &quot;less than&quot; relation formula_31 between real numbers: if formula_32 then necessarily formula_33 is not less than formula_34 More generally, any strict partial order is an asymmetric relation. Not all asymmetric relations are strict partial orders. An example of an asymmetric non-transitive, even antitransitive relation is the relation: if formula_2 beats formula_36 then formula_37 does not beat formula_38 and if formula_2 beats formula_37 and formula_37 beats formula_42 then formula_2 does not beat formula_44

Restrictions and converses of asymmetric relations are also asymmetric. For example, the restriction of formula_31 from the reals to the integers is still asymmetric, and the converse or dual formula_46 of formula_31 is also asymmetric.

An asymmetric relation need not have the connex property. For example, the strict subset relation formula_48 is asymmetric, and neither of the sets formula_49 and formula_50 is a strict subset of the other. A relation is connex if and only if its complement is asymmetric.

A non-example is the &quot;less than or equal&quot; relation formula_51. This is not asymmetric, because reversing for example, formula_52 produces formula_52 and both are true. The less-than-or-equal relation is an example of a relation that is neither symmetric nor asymmetric, showing that asymmetry is not the same thing as &quot;not symmetric&quot;.

The empty relation is the only relation that is (vacuously) both symmetric and asymmetric.

== Properties ==

The following conditions are sufficient for a relation formula_1 to be asymmetric:
* formula_1 is irreflexive and anti-symmetric (this is also necessary)
* formula_1 is irreflexive and transitive. A transitive relation is asymmetric if and only if it is irreflexive: if formula_57 and formula_58 transitivity gives formula_59 contradicting irreflexivity. Such a relation is a strict partial order.
* formula_1 is irreflexive and satisfies semiorder property 1 (there do not exist two mutually incomparable two-point linear orders)
* formula_1 is anti-transitive and anti-symmetric
* formula_1 is anti-transitive and transitive
* formula_1 is anti-transitive and satisfies semi-order property 1

== See also ==

* Tarski&#x27;s axiomatization of the reals – part of this is the requirement that formula_31 over the real numbers be asymmetric.

<text>The Israeli Communist Party, commonly known by its Hebrew abbreviation Maki (), is a far-left communist political party in Israel that forms part of the political alliance known as Hadash. It was originally known as Rakah (), an acronym for &quot;Reshima Komunistit Hadasha&quot; (&quot;New Communist List&quot;), after breaking away from the original Maki in the 1960s.

==History==

Rakah was formed on 1 September 1965 due to internal disagreements in Maki, the original Israeli Communist Party, which was split between a largely Jewish and Zionist faction led by Moshe Sneh that was critical of the Soviet Union&#x27;s anti-Zionist stance, and a largely Arab faction that was increasingly anti-Zionist. 

As a result, the pro-Arab/pro-Soviet faction (including Emile Habibi, Tawfik Toubi and Meir Vilner) left Maki to form a new party, Rakah, which the Soviet Union recognised as the &quot;official&quot; Communist Party. Shlomo Sand and Mahmoud Darwish were also Rakah activists. 

The Eurocommunist faction, led by Sneh, remained in Maki. It was reported in the Soviet media that the Mikunis–Sneh group defected to the bourgeois-nationalist camp.

The 1965 Israeli legislative election saw Rakah party win three seats, comprehensively beating Maki as it slumped to just one. Rakah&#x27;s opposition to Zionism and the Six-Day War meant that they were excluded from the national unity governments of the sixth Knesset. In the 1969 Israeli legislative election Rakah again won three seats. During the 1973 Israeli legislative election Rakah saw a rise in support as the party picked up four seats.

Before the 1977 elections the party joined with some other small left-wing and Arab parties, including some members of the Israeli Black Panthers to form Hadash. After the original Maki had disappeared after merging into Ratz in 1981, members of Rakah decided to change the party&#x27;s name to Maki in 1989. The party remains the leading force in Hadash, and owns the &quot;Al-Ittihad&quot; newspaper.

<text>Trojan was a British automobile manufacturer producing light cars between 1914 and 1965, and light commercial vehicles for a short time.

==Early history==

The company was founded by Leslie Hayward Hounsfield (1877–1957) who went into business as a general engineer in a small workshop called the Polygon Engineering Works in Clapham, South London. He got the idea to make a simple, economical car that would be easy to drive and started design work in 1910. Hounsfield was a Whitworth Exhibitioner in 1898 and President of the Whitworth Society in 1946.

In 1913 a prototype was completed. It had a two-stroke engine with four cylinders arranged in pairs, and each pair shared a common combustion chamber – a doubled-up version of what would later be called the &quot;split-single&quot; engine. The pistons in each pair drove the crankshaft together as they were coupled to it by a V-shaped connecting rod. For this arrangement to work, it is necessary for the connecting rod to flex slightly, which goes completely against normal practice. The claim was that each engine had only seven moving parts, four pistons, two connecting rods and a crankshaft. This was connected to a two-speed epicyclic gearbox, to simplify gear changing, and a chain to the rear wheels. Solid tyres were used, (even though these were antiquated for car use), to prevent punctures and very long springs used to give some comfort.

War broke out before production could start, and from 1914 to 1918, Trojan Ltd, as the company had become in 1914, made production tools and gauges. In 1920 the first series of six cars was made from a works in Croydon and the final production version was shown at the 1922 London Motor Show. An agreement was reached with Leyland Motors to produce the cars at their Kingston upon Thames factory, where work on reconditioning former Royal Air Force wartime trucks was running down. This arrangement continued until 1928, when Leyland wanted factory space for truck production. During the nearly seven years of the agreement 11,000 cars and 6700 vans were made.

==Trojan Utility Car==
The Trojan Utility Car entered the market at £230, which was reduced to £125 in 1925, the same as a Model T Ford. Nothing was conventional. Rather than a chassis the car had a punt shaped tray which housed the engine and transmission below the seats. The transmission used a chain to drive the solid tyre shod wheels. The 1527 cc engine to the ingenious Hounsfield design was started by pulling a lever on the right of the driver. To prove how economical the car was to run, the company ran the slogan &quot;Can you afford to walk?&quot; and calculated that over it would cost more in shoes and socks than to cover the distance by Trojan car.

A modified car was released in 1920 with a smaller 1488 cc engine to bring it into the sub-1.5-litre class and with pneumatic tyres available as an option; the car was guaranteed for . A major contract was agreed with Brooke Bond tea for delivery vans, making the car familiar all over Britain, and with a top speed of , not causing too much worry over speeding drivers.

==RE Trojan and the 1930s==
With the ending of the Leyland partnership, Leslie Hounsfield took production back to Croydon, although at new premises, with Leyland continuing to supply some parts until the early 1930s. In spite of new body styles, sales of the cars were falling, so a new model, the RE, or Rear Engine, capable of , was announced in 1931. Still without an electric starter and with only rear-wheel braking, it was beginning to look very old fashioned and, although more modern bodies were fitted, only about 250 were sold.

A final attempt was the Wayfarer of 1934, with the engine back in the middle, but fitted with a three-speed gearbox and shaft drive. However, only three were sold and the 6-cylinder Mastra did no better, with only two produced. Nevertheless, the original van continued to sell well, and the Utility car could still be ordered; the last one was delivered in 1937.

Leslie Hounsfield had left the company in 1930 to set up a new enterprise making, amongst other things, the &quot;Safari&quot; camp bed, which would be made in thousands during the Second World War.

Trojan Ltd continued to make vans until war broke out, and during hostilities made bomb racks and parachute containers. With peace, van production restarted, still using the original engine, but that was replaced by a Perkins diesel in 1952.
==Bubble and sports cars==

In 1959 the company was bought by Peter Agg and from 1960 to 1965 he built Heinkel bubble cars under licence, selling them as the Trojan 200, the last vehicle to bear the Trojan name. The company acquired the rights to build the Elva Courier sports car in 1962, producing 210 cars between 1962 and 1965 when production switched from road cars to the McLaren-Elva racing car.

The company existed as Trojan Limited (Company No 134254 having been incorporated on 27/02/1914) until 19/03/2013, but no longer operating from the Croydon factory, which had been sold, on which latter date it was dissolved via &quot;Voluntary Strike-off&quot;.
==Trojan Trobike==

Trobike was a type of mini-bike. Although preceded by the Second World War military Welbike and later Corgi for the civilian market, it was one of the earliest to be sold in kit form, thus avoiding purchase tax.

The Trojan Lambretta group was founded in 1959 when Lambretta Concessionaires Ltd took over Trojan Ltd, one of the oldest firms in the British motor industry. At about the time the group owned the Clinton Engine Corporation of Maquoketa, Iowa, USA.

Clinton were world famous for their engines used in lawnmowers and chainsaws. At this time many were supplied for use in portable generators, paint sprayers etc.

During the late 1950s the British public was becoming aware of the craze sweeping teenage America – karting (or go-karting). The sport arrived in Britain with US servicemen bringing outfits over and even making their own.

At first, the most popular engine was the 2.5 hp 95 cc Clinton engine – being both readily available and cheap. By 1959 Trojan began making the Trokart using this engine. It was sold both in built-up form and as a kit to avoid purchase tax, selling for just £25. By 1963 it was estimated that 250,000 engines in the US and 10,000 in Britain had been sold, all for karting.

The first printed mention of the Trobike is June 1960 and the first road test published on Thursday 22 December 1960 in &quot;Motor Cycling with Scooter Weekly&quot;. The price then quoted was £35 in kit form, although two adverts in 1962 quoted £29. This may account for the fact that it was made for road use with front and rear brakes, and also for off-road use with a rear brake only.

By November 1961 the factory, also producing the Lambretta scooters, had tooled up to produce the Heinkel three-wheeled bubble car, then known as the Trojan Cabin Cruiser. It seems that the Trobike was a limited success, with perhaps only 500–600 being sold over the two-year period – the last confirmed despatch being 6 March 1962. Known frame numbers range from TB501 to TB1148.

The very last machines were sold to a farmer and known as the Sussex Miniscooter. Later still, a variant known as the Lowline Chimp appeared, using a very similar frame and again a Clinton engine.

Originally, machines had black handlebar rubbers but some later models were fitted with buff-coloured rubbers. The twist grip on early machines (as appear on factory literature) was manufactured by Amal with the cable entering parallel to the handlebars. Later bikes had the more typical Amal twist grip with the cable entering from below.

Later models were fitted with a bashplate between the lower frame downtubes (by frame number TB879). The bashplate was dual purpose: to stop dirt entering the air filter, and also to protect the carburettor from damage. Even later models (by frame number TB1029) were fitted with a further small light steel plate shielding the carburettor float bowl and fitted under the heads of the front two engine mounting bolts.

Frame
The frame is manufactured from steel tube which is electrically welded to resist shock and impact. The steering head is mounted on ball bearings. The front mudguard and the integral rear chain and mudguard are built of resin reinforced glass fibre and finished in red to contrast with the white enamel finish of the frame assembly.

Engine
The Clinton A490 Panther 2-stroke engine is centrally mounted. The engine position is adjustable to suit chain tension. The starting is by recoil starter, power being delivered to the rear wheel through an automatic centrifugal clutch which comes into effect upon opening of the throttle.

Models
Two models – the Garden Model and Road Model – are basically similar, with the difference that the Garden Model does not include number plates, front wheel brake and brake lever, hooter or tax disc. Trobikes have an eye-catching colour scheme – white frames, forks, handlebars, and wheels – yellow engines – red chain/mudguards. A foam rubber saddle covered with black plastic leather cloth is fitted to each machine.

Wheels
Wheels are made from pressed steel and are of the split rim type for easy tyre removal. Both front and rear wheels run on opposed high-grade taper roller bearings on an alloy steel spindle, which is designed for easy wheel removal. Car-type internal expanding brakes are used.

<text>King Roger (, Op. 46) is an opera in three acts by Karol Szymanowski to a Polish libretto by the composer himself and Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, the composer&#x27;s cousin. The score was finished in 1924. The opera received its world premiere on 19 June 1926 at the Grand Theatre, Warsaw, with the cast including the composer&#x27;s sister, the soprano Stanisława Korwin-Szymanowska, as Roxana.

The &quot;Sicilian drama&quot;, as he called it, originated from Szymanowski&#x27;s enthusiasm for Mediterranean culture as a melting pot of different peoples and religions. He spent much time travelling in that area in 1911 and in 1914, and shared his love of the region with Iwaszkiewicz. In the summer of 1918 at Odessa, Szymanowski and Iwaszkiewicz conceived the project, and composed the opera over the period of 1918 to 1924. Szymanowski&#x27;s lost novel &quot;Efebos&quot; dealt with mystical themes similar to those that inspired this work; Szymanowski labelled it a &quot;Misterium&quot;.

Jim Samson has placed &quot;King Roger&quot; in a musico-psychological analysis of Szymanowski&#x27;s compositional struggles. Alistair Wightman has briefly discussed Szymanowski&#x27;s stylised treatment of Arabic musical idioms in the score. Stephen Downes has analysed in detail the themes of &quot;duality&quot; and &quot;transformation&quot; expressed in the music of the opera.

==Performance history==
Since its 1926 premiere, stagings of &quot;King Roger&quot; have been relatively rare. Two productions followed closely, the first at Theater Duisburg, Germany, in October 1928, and the second in October 1932 at the Národní divadlo in Prague. The first post-World War II presentation took place in Palermo in 1949 in the presence of its librettist, conducted by , set design by Renato Guttuso, sang Roger, Clara Petrella sang Roxana, the Shepherd. After that some years passed before the opera was staged again.

In 1975, the New Opera Company in London produced the work under the baton of Charles Mackerras. In the USA the opera was first seen in 1981, in a concert version given by the St. Louis Symphony in St. Louis, conducted by Leonard Slatkin. That same year it was presented at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, conducted by Stanisław Wisłocki.

Since the late 1980s and into the present century, &quot;King Roger&quot; seems to have enjoyed something of a revival with about thirteen productions in many different locations. In 1988, the Long Beach Opera in California, known for its innovative approach to the repertoire, had Murry Sidlin as conductor and James Johnson as King Roger, Nancy Shade as Roxana, and Jonathan Mack as Edrisi. A concert performance was given on 3 March 1990 at the Royal Festival Hall by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Andrew Davis. This was the opening concert of a festival of Szymanowski&#x27;s works given by the South Bank Arts Centre. David Wilson-Johnson took the title role, with Wieslaw Ochman as the Shepherd, Eilene Hannan as Roxana, Martyn Hill as Edrisi, Matthew Best as the Archbishop and Anne Collins as the Archdeaconess. Sydney Dance Company used the opera as a recorded soundtrack for its ballet of King Roger in the Sydney Opera House in 1990. Palermo presented &quot;King Roger&quot; again in 1992. Four concert versions were given by the end of the 1990s: the first by Orchestre National de France in Paris, conducted by Charles Dutoit in 1996 and at the London Proms by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra under Simon Rattle in 1998, while the third and fourth performances were presented in Montreal and subsequently, on October 17, 1999, at Carnegie Hall for the New York Premiere with Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.

In the 21st century, &quot;King Roger&quot; was given by the Polish National Opera in 2000 and in the same year also in Amsterdam by the Netherlands Opera, conducted by Hartmut Haenchen. In 2002, Charles Dutoit conducted the Japanese premiere of the work in a concert version with the NHK Symphony Orchestra in Tokyo, as well as in Prague with the Czech Philharmonic in 2007. The Mariinsky Opera Company brought the work to the Edinburgh Festival in 2008 under Valery Gergiev and directed by Mariusz Treliński.

It was presented in Palermo in 2005 and also by the Wrocław Opera in 2007. A subsequent US performance was at the Bard SummerScape festival in 2008.

Both the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona and the Opéra National de Paris in Paris, conducted by Kazushi Ono presented it in 2009. In 2011, &quot;King Roger&quot; appeared at the Staatstheater Mainz. A new production of the opera was staged in Polish at The Santa Fe Opera on 21 July 2012 with Mariusz Kwiecień in the title role. In 2013, &quot;King Roger&quot; was presented at the 17th Festival Amazonas de Ópera in Manaus, Brazil, with in the title role. In June 2014, a new production was staged at the Wuppertal Opera House in Germany. Two performances took place in Boston in March 2015 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Charles Dutoit. The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, introduced a new co-production with Opera Australia, conducted by Antonio Pappano, in May 2015. The first performance in Australia was shown by Opera Australia in 2017 in Sydney and Melbourne, conducted by Andrea Molino, with Saimir Pirgu as Shepherd.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
:Place: Sicily
:Time: 12th century
The story concerns the enlightenment of the Christian King Roger II by a young shepherd who represents pagan ideals.

===Act 1===
&quot;Often known as the &quot;Byzantine&quot; act&quot;

The Shepherd is introduced to King Roger and his court during mass at the Palermo Cathedral. Despite calls by the Archbishop as well as the crowd for his punishment as a heretic, Roxana, Roger&#x27;s wife, convinces the King not to kill him. She implores him to pass a fair judgment on the Shepherd. Roger orders the young man to appear at the palace that night, where he will explain himself and submit to the King&#x27;s judgement.

===Act 2===
&quot;The &quot;Oriental&quot; act, representing India and the Middle East&quot;

As instructed, the Shepherd appears at the palace gates. Roxana sings a seductive song which is clearly a response to the visitor, causing Roger to grow increasingly agitated. As the Shepherd is led in, he describes his faith in detail and soon almost the entire court joins him in an ecstatic dance. Roger attempts to chain him, but the Shepherd easily breaks free, and leaves the palace with almost all of those assembled following him. At first the King and his Arab advisor, Edrisi are left alone, but soon it is decided that Roger will join the Shepherd.

===Act 3===
&quot;The &quot;Greco-Roman&quot; act&quot;

In an ancient Greek theater, King Roger and Edrisi rejoin Roxana, who informs her husband that only the Shepherd can free him of his fear and jealousy. A fire is lit, and the Shepherd&#x27;s followers commence another dance, while the Shepherd is transformed into Dionysus. As the dance ends and the participants leave the stage, Roger is left transformed by the experience, and sings a joyous hymn at the arrival of the morning sun.

<text>The Serbo-Bulgarian War or the Serbian–Bulgarian War (, &quot;Srăbsko-bălgarska voyna&quot;, , &quot;Srpsko-bugarski rat&quot;), a war between the Kingdom of Serbia and the Principality of Bulgaria, erupted on and lasted until . Despite Bulgaria&#x27;s status as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottomans did not intervene in the war. Serbia initiated the fighting but suffered a decisive defeat. Austria-Hungary demanded that Bulgaria stop its invasion, and a truce resulted. The final peace was signed on in Bucharest. The existing boundaries did not change. As a result of the war, European powers acknowledged the act of Unification of Bulgaria which had happened on .

== Background ==

On , Bulgaria and the semi-autonomous Ottoman province of Eastern Rumelia declared their unification in the city of Plovdiv. Eastern Rumelia, whose population was predominantly ethnic Bulgarian, had been an artificial creation of the Berlin Congress seven years earlier. The unification took place against the will of the Great Powers, including Russia. Austria-Hungary had been expanding its influence in the Balkans and was particularly opposed to the unification. Bulgaria&#x27;s western neighbour, Serbia, also feared it would diminish its position in the Balkans. In addition, Serbia&#x27;s ruler, Milan I (1868–1889), was annoyed that pro-Russian opposition leaders like Nikola Pašić, who had stirred up the Timok Rebellion, had found asylum in Bulgaria after the suppression of the rebellion by the Serbian Army.

After the declaration of unification, massive protests broke out in Greece for fear of the creation of a Greater Bulgarian state in the Balkans. They called upon the Greek government to declare war on Bulgaria. Serbia proposed to Greece a joint military action against Bulgaria, but Greece rejected the proposal.

Lured by Austria-Hungary&#x27;s promises of support and territorial gains from Bulgaria (in return for concessions in the Western Balkans), Milan I declared war on Bulgaria on . The military strategy relied largely on surprise, as Bulgaria expected an attack from the Ottoman Empire and had moved its troops to the area near the Ottoman border, to the southeast.

The Serbian pretext was a minor border dispute, known as the Bregovo Dispute. The Timok river, which formed part of the border between the two countries, had slightly changed its course over the years. As a result, a Serbian border guardhouse near the village of Bregovo had found itself on the Bulgarian bank of the river. After some denied requests from Bulgaria to evacuate the guardhouse, Bulgaria expelled the Serbian troops by force.
Bulgarian sources on the other hand, outline several Serbian intrusions into Bulgarian territory as the start of hostilities. Bulgarian troops were positioned away from the border in order to not give Serbia cause for attack by defending the border by force. After several incursions fire was finally exchanged on the .

As it happened, the Ottomans did not intervene, and the Serbian army&#x27;s advance was stopped after the Battle of Slivnitsa. The main body of the Bulgarian army traveled from the Ottoman border in the southeast to the Serbian border in the northwest to defend the capital Sofia. After the defensive battles at Slivnitsa and Vidin (the latter&#x27;s defence was organized by Atanas Uzunov), Bulgaria began an offensive which took the city of Pirot. Austria-Hungary then stepped in and threatened to join the war on Serbia&#x27;s side if the Bulgarian troops did not pull back.

No territorial changes were made to either country, but the unification was recognised by the great powers. However, the relationship of trust and friendship between Serbia and Bulgaria, which had been built during their long common fight against Ottoman rule, suffered irreparable damage.

== Serbian army ==

The Serbian army&#x27;s infantry weaponry stood up to the most modern standards of the time (Mauser-Milovanović single fire rifles with excellent ballistic characteristics). However, the artillery was ill-equipped, still using muzzle-loading cannons of the La Hitte system. Breech-loading cannons of the De Bange system had been ordered and paid for, but did not arrive in Serbia until 1886. The total number of Serbian armed forces expected to take part in the military operation was about 60,000. King Milan I divided his force into two armies, the Nishava and Timok armies. The first undertook the main objective, i.e., to overcome the Bulgarian defences along the west border, to conquer Sofia and advance towards the Ihtiman heights. It was there that the army was supposed to encounter and crush the Bulgarian forces coming from the southeast. Serbia&#x27;s main advantages on paper were the better small arms and the highly educated commanders and soldiers, who had gained a great deal of experience from the last two wars against the Ottoman Empire.

However, internal Serbian problems supplemented by King Milan&#x27;s conduct of the war, nullified most of these advantages:

In order to claim all the glory for the victory he considered imminent, King Milan did not call upon the most famous commanders of the previous wars (Gen. Jovan Belimarković, Gen. Đura Horvatović and Gen. Milojko Lešjanin) to command the army. Instead, he took the position of army commander himself and gave most of the divisional commands to officers chosen primarily for their loyalty and not war records like Petar Topalović of the Morava division who had previously commanded the troops suppressing the militarily poorly organized Timok Rebellion.

Furthermore, underestimating the Bulgarian military strength and fearing mutinies for conducting such an unpopular war (and having indeed experienced the Timok Rebellion two years before), he ordered the mobilisation of only the first class of infantry (recruits younger than 30 years), which meant mobilising only about half of the available Serbian manpower. In doing so, he deprived the Serbian army of its veterans of the previous wars against the Ottoman Empire.

The modern rifles, despite being among the best in Europe at the time, still had issues of their own: they were introduced only two years before the outbreak of the war, and as such many of the soldiers were not well-trained in their use. More importantly, the theoretical capabilities of the rifle often misled the Serbian officers, who still lacked experience with it, into ordering volleys from distances of half a mile or more, wasting precious ammunition for negligible results. Furthermore, the quantity of ammunition purchased was based on the consumption of bullets by the previous, much older and slower-firing rifles. The situation was made worse still by the contemporary Serbian tactics, which emphasized firepower and downplayed hand-to-hand fighting, which contributed to heavy casualties in the fight for Neškov Vis in defense of Pirot.

== Bulgarian army ==

Bulgaria was forced to meet the Serbian threat with two serious disadvantages. When the unification had been declared, Russia had withdrawn its military officers, who had until that moment commanded all larger units of Bulgaria&#x27;s young army. The remaining Bulgarian officers had lower ranks and no experience in commanding units larger than platoons (causing the conflict to be dubbed &quot;The War of the Captains&quot;). Also, since the Bulgarian government had expected an attack from the Ottoman Empire, the main forces of the Bulgarian Army were along the southeastern border. Their redeployment across Bulgaria would take at least five to six days.

=== Advantages ===
Bulgaria&#x27;s main advantages were its strong patriotic spirit and high morale and its men feeling that they were fighting for a just cause. The same could not be said about the Serbia, whose king had misled them in his manifesto to the army by telling the Serbian soldiers that they were being sent to help the Bulgarians in their war against the Ottomans, and the Serbian soldiers were initially surprised to find that they were fighting Bulgarians instead. Presumably, lying to his army was King Milan&#x27;s only means to mobilize and command his troops without experiencing disobedience and unrest.

Furthermore, the Bulgarians had small arms that were inferior to those of the Serbs but had artillery that was greatly superior by featuring modern steel, Krupp-designed breech-loading cannons.

=== Strategic plan ===
There were two views on the Bulgarian strategy: the first, supported by Prince Alexander of Battenberg, saw the general battle on the Ihtiman heights. The drawback of this plan was that in that case, the capital Sofia had to be surrendered without battle. This could very well cause Serbia to stop the war and call in the arbitrage of the Great Powers. For this reason, the strategic plan that was finally selected by the Bulgarian command expected the main clash to be in the area of Slivnitsa. Captain Olimpi Panov had an important role in this final decision.

== Military activities ==
=== 16–19 November ===
Prince Alexander I arrived on the evening of 16 November to find a well prepared defensive position manned by 9 battalions, plus some 2000 volunteers and 32 guns, commanded by Major Guchev. The position consisted of nearly 4 km of trenches and artillery redoubts on either side of the main road on a ridge in front of Slivnitsa city. To the right was steep mountainous terrain whilst the left wing had the easier Visker Hills towards Breznik.

The three Serbian centre divisions also arrived on 16 November and halted to recover after the fierce Bulgarian delaying action in the Dragoman Pass. The Morava division was at some distance from its objective, Breznik, which lay to the south. The northern advance was bogged down along the Danube. 
The morning of 17 November came with rain and mist but not the expected Serbian attack. By 10 in the morning, Alexander ordered three battalions to advance on the right. They surprised the Danube division, who eventually rallied and pushed them back. The main Serbian attack began on the centre largely unsupported by artillery which had insufficient range. The weight of Bulgarian fire forced them back with some 1,200 casualties. A relief column led by Captain Benderev recaptured the heights on the right and forced the Danube division back to the road.

At daybreak on 18 November the Serbians attacked the weaker left flank of the Bulgarian line. Just in time two battalions of the Preslav Regiment arrived to shore up the position. Further attacks in the centre were repulsed with heavy Serbian casualties and Benderev captured two further positions in the mountains.

On 19 November the Serbians concentrated two divisions for an attack on the Bulgarian left near Karnul (today Delyan, Sofia Province) in an attempt to join up with the Morava division. However, three battalions of Bulgarian troops led by Captain Popov from Sofia had held the Morava division in the Visker Hills and the flanking move failed. Alexander now ordered a counterattack which pushed the Serbians back on both flanks although nightfall prevented a complete collapse.

=== 19–28 November ===
Slivnitsa was the decisive battle of the war. The Serbians fought only limited rearguard actions as they retreated and by 24 November they were back in Serbia. The Timok Division in the north continued the Siege of Vidin until 29 November.

The main Bulgarian army crossed the border in two strong divisions (Guchev and Nikolaev), supported by flanking columns, and converged on Pirot. The Serbian army dug in on the heights west of the town. On 27 November the Bulgarian Army flanked the right of the Serbian position with Prince Alexander personally leading the final attack. The Serbians abandoned Pirot, retreated towards Niš and called a general mobilization of their military reservists, but they did not arrive at the front before the cease-fire.

== End of war and peace treaty ==
The Serbian defeat made Austria-Hungary take action. On 28 November, the Viennese ambassador to Belgrade, Count Rudolf of Khevenhüller-Metsch, visited the headquarters of the Bulgarian Army and demanded the cessation of military actions, threatening that otherwise the Bulgarian forces would face Austro-Hungarian troops. The ceasefire was signed on 28 November, but that did not stop the Serbians from continuing unsuccessful attempts to conquer Vidin with the idea to use it in negotiations later, even after military activities had stopped on demand of their ally. On 3 March 1886 the peace treaty was signed in Bucharest. According to its terms, no changes were to be made along the Bulgarian-Serbian border.

The war was an important step in the strengthening of Bulgaria&#x27;s international position. To a large extent, the victory preserved the Bulgarian unification. The defeat left a lasting scar on the Serbian military, previously considered by the Serbian people to be undefeated. Ambitious reforms of the army were carried out (which later, in part, contributed to the end of the Obrenović dynasty).

King Milan&#x27;s poor judgment and leadership are generally considered as the main reasons behind Serbia&#x27;s defeat in the conflict. Milan believed the conflict would entail &quot;taking a walk to Sofia&quot; and thus mustered only one-third of the Serbian army&#x27;s manpower, as he was in constant fear of possible plots against him and wished to keep the rest of the military within Serbia&#x27;s borders. Milan decided to declare war on his own personal whim and based on his own interpretation of the terms of the Congress of Berlin. Prominent Serbian statesman and politician Stojan Novaković and other Serbian political leaders did not share the king&#x27;s enthusiasm for the war. Novaković advocated reaching a peaceful settlement with the Bulgarians and believed that the Balkan countries should cooperate, as had occurred during the rule of Prince Mihailo Obrenović. Novaković criticised Milan&#x27;s actions as authoritarian, pretentious and not founded on facts.

The Serbian population was generally unenthusiastic and did not support the war, and did not understand the reasons behind it. According to the academic Slobodan Jovanović, the Serbian population generally viewed the conflict as Milan&#x27;s &quot;cabinet war&quot;. Politician Milan Piroćanac believed that Milan did not start the war for patriotic reasons, but that he instead wished to secure funds from abroad in order to repay his numerous debts to the Austro-Hungarians. A number of Serb officers and civil servants were against the war, describing the Bulgarians as the Serbs&#x27; &quot;neighbours&quot; and &quot;Orthodox brothers&quot;. The academic Milan Đ. Milićević recounted that many Belgraders protested against the war and commented that Serbs and Bulgarians &quot;are almost the same people&quot;. Milan&#x27;s consort Natalie was also opposed to the war. On the other hand, part of the Serbian military establishment fully supported the war effort, citing Bulgarian atrocities against Serb civilians, including murder, theft and rape, in southern Serbia and what the Serbian leadership called Old Serbia, which was still under Ottoman control. After the war, Milan turned his attention to modern-day North Macedonia, where Serbian and Bulgarian interests were conflicted. The Serbian army and political elite drew numerous lessons from the war, and proceeded to modernise and adapt the military and its tactics to the demands of modern warfare.

<doc id="1229414" wikidata="Q38916" url="?curid=1229414" title="McNab dog">
<text>The McNab Dog, also called the McNab Shepherd or McNab Collie is a herding dog that originated in Hopland, Mendocino County, Northern California. The McNab was bred to withstand the tough conditions found in California such as heat, burrs, foxtails, and rugged terrain. Until recently, the McNab was little known outside California, but in last three decades have seen a gain in popularity and geographic dispersal of the breed.

==Appearance==
The appearance of the McNab can vary considerably. The dog is medium-sized with females standing 16–21 inches at the shoulder and weighing 30–50 pounds and males standing 18–25 inches at the shoulder and weighing 35–65 pounds. The dogs have a variety of ear sets from pricked ears to floppy ears and everything in between. Tails are either short (bobbed naturally or mechanically) or long. McNabs come in colors of black, red, blonde, blue, lilac and sable with variations of solid, added white or added white and tan (tri colored). Their eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and brown, hazel, or copper colored. The McNab coat is close, dense and weather resistant. They can have a slick single short coat, a short double coat, or a medium length single coat, but their fur is never long. One of the distinctive features of the McNab is their cat-like feet, which contribute to their agility.

==Breed status==
The McNab is currently not recognized as a standardized breed by any major kennel club, including the American Kennel Club (AKC).

In 2014, a group of McNab Shepherd breeders and enthusiasts established the McNab Shepherd Registry (MSR). According to the MSR, their goal is to continue the betterment, advancement and welfare of the McNab Shepherd. The MSR is what is known as a &quot;founding registry&quot; because they exclusively utilize discovered genetic markers and DNA verification for registration.

Beginning in 2014, the MSR worked with Mars Veterinary on a study in an attempt to establish a unique genetic signature for the McNab Shepherd. Samples collected from McNabs across the United States were evaluated for their genetic signature and found to support the creation of a unique breed signature for the McNab. Additionally, the tested dogs were also evaluated for certain physical traits and over 100 disease-causing mutations to help establish a baseline for these in the McNab population.

==Temperament==
McNab Shepherds require more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds. A working McNab frequently runs for miles a day, using its herding skills to control livestock, and they can become restless if isolated or neglected. Unlike some other herding breeds, McNabs are not hyperactive. Providing a McNab has plenty of exercise, it is content to nap at its owner&#x27;s side with a watchful and protective eye.

McNabs often bond tightly to their family members, including other household pets. They have a keen sense of territory and seldom wander away from home. They are also more likely to defend their territory and family members than many of the more sensitive herding breeds.

McNabs can be assertive and demanding, and they do best with guardians who are firm, consistent and skilled in positive dog training methods that don&#x27;t trigger the McNabs instinct to push back against obstacles. Highly intelligent and quick to learn, the McNab needs to exercise its brain as much as its body. Families considering a McNab for a pet will need to set aside plenty of time to spend with their dog.

==Health==
McNabs are hardy dogs with no breed specific health problems. Their average life span is 13–15 years.

McNab dogs may carry the MDR1 mutant gene and can be very sensitive to Ivermectin, which is a common ingredient in heartworm prevention medications. This drug and others can cause serious health problems or even death. A DNA test that demonstrates whether a dog has the mutation is available through the Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine. The test can be completed by sending them a cheek swab through the mail.

==Activities==
McNabs have a loose-eyed herding style and tend to work more independently than many herding breeds. They are skilled at both heading and heeling stock, meaning they can turn stock from the front or get behind stock and drive them forward. Originally bred to herd sheep, stock handlers quickly discovered that the McNabs bold nature and working abilities made them ideal for herding cattle. McNabs are also used for herding geese, goats, llamas and gathering horses in from the pasture. Renowned for their incredible endurance, McNabs have been known to cover over a hundred miles a day driving their herds.

McNabs are becoming increasingly popular in the world of dog sports. Their outstanding athletic prowess and agility coupled with high intelligence make them ideal competitors. McNabs are now competing successfully in agility trials, dock diving, disc dog competitions, herding, lure coursing, dog sledding, skijoring and flyball. They are also exceptional competitors in barn hunt and nose work. Many ranchers are competing with McNabs in the relatively new sport of Ranch Dog Herding where dog and handler on horseback work as a team herding three head of cattle through five obstacles and then into a stock trailer.

The McNabs reputation as an indefatigable &quot;all-weather&quot; dog is also opening up a new avenue of work for the dog: Search and Rescue. Currently McNabs are working as evidence search dogs, cadaver dogs, archaeology dogs, and area search dogs for missing persons. Where many other breeds have to be pulled off the search because the dog is tiring, the only limitation for the McNab is the energy of its handler.

In addition to the above activities, McNabs are now becoming more common as service dogs, demonstrating sensitivity to the medical and psychological needs of humans.

==History==
Alexander McNab left his native Scotland in the late 19th century, homesteading his 10,000 acre sheep ranch located in the Sanel Rancho, which later became Hopland, California. Looking to develop a herding dog that could handle the rough conditions on his ranch. McNab aptly called his dogs &quot;McNab Shepherds&quot;.

In the early 1900s, the elder McNab passed the ranch down to his youngest son, John McNab, an attorney and stockman who reinvigorated his father&#x27;s breeding style. Refinement of the McNab Shepherd continued and additional dogs were imported from Scotland for breeding and ranching purposes.

Over time, the McNab dogs proved to be supreme herding dogs which California ranchers came to depend on with confidence. Now the breed is spreading across the United States and Canada with a few McNabs working as stock dogs in Germany and some sporting McNabs as far away as Japan.

<doc id="1229416" wikidata="Q5957795" url="?curid=1229416" title="Hyperbolic motion">
<text>In geometry, hyperbolic motions are isometric automorphisms of a hyperbolic space. Under composition of mappings, the hyperbolic motions form a continuous group. This group is said to characterize the hyperbolic space. Such an approach to geometry was cultivated by Felix Klein in his Erlangen program. The idea of reducing geometry to its characteristic group was developed particularly by Mario Pieri in his reduction of the primitive notions of geometry to merely point and &quot;motion&quot;.

Hyperbolic motions are often taken from inversive geometry: these are mappings composed of reflections in a line or a circle (or in a hyperplane or a hypersphere for hyperbolic spaces of more than two dimensions). To distinguish the hyperbolic motions, a particular line or circle is taken as the absolute. The proviso is that the absolute must be an invariant set of all hyperbolic motions. The absolute divides the plane into two connected components, and hyperbolic motions must &quot;not&quot; permute these components.

One of the most prevalent contexts for inversive geometry and hyperbolic motions is in the study of mappings of the complex plane by Möbius transformations. Textbooks on complex functions often mention two common models of hyperbolic geometry: the Poincaré half-plane model where the absolute is the real line on the complex plane, and the Poincaré disk model where the absolute is the unit circle in the complex plane.
Hyperbolic motions can also be described on the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry.

This article exhibits these examples of the use of hyperbolic motions: the extension of the metric formula_1 to the half-plane and the unit disk.

== Motions on the hyperbolic plane ==
Every motion (transformation or isometry) of the hyperbolic plane to itself can be realized as the composition of at most three reflections. In &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hyperbolic space, up to &quot;n&quot;+1 reflections might be required. (These are also true for Euclidean and spherical geometries, but the classification below is different.)

All the isometries of the hyperbolic plane can be classified into these classes:
* Orientation preserving
** the identity isometry — nothing moves; zero reflections; zero degrees of freedom.
** inversion through a point (half turn) — two reflections through mutually perpendicular lines passing through the given point, i.e. a rotation of 180 degrees around the point; two degrees of freedom.
** rotation around a normal point — two reflections through lines passing through the given point (includes inversion as a special case); points move on circles around the center; three degrees of freedom.
** &quot;rotation&quot; around an ideal point (horolation) — two reflections through lines leading to the ideal point; points move along horocycles centered on the ideal point; two degrees of freedom.
** translation along a straight line — two reflections through lines perpendicular to the given line; points off the given line move along hypercycles; three degrees of freedom.
* Orientation reversing
** reflection through a line — one reflection; two degrees of freedom.
** combined reflection through a line and translation along the same line — the reflection and translation commute; three reflections required; three degrees of freedom.

==Introduction of metric in the Poincaré half-plane model==
The points of the Poincaré half-plane model HP are given in Cartesian coordinates as {(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;): &quot;y&quot; &gt; 0} or in polar coordinates as {(&quot;r&quot; cos &quot;a&quot;, &quot;r&quot; sin &quot;a&quot;): 0 &lt; &quot;a&quot; &lt; π, &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0 }.
The hyperbolic motions will be taken to be a composition of three fundamental hyperbolic motions.
Let &quot;p&quot; = (&quot;x,y&quot;) or &quot;p&quot; = (&quot;r&quot; cos &quot;a&quot;, &quot;r&quot; sin &quot;a&quot;), &quot;p&quot; ∈ HP. 

The fundamental motions are:
: &quot;p&quot; → &quot;q&quot; = (&quot;x&quot; + &quot;c&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ), &quot;c&quot; ∈ R (left or right shift)
: &quot;p&quot; → &quot;q&quot; = (&quot;sx&quot;, &quot;sy&quot; ), &quot;s&quot; &gt; 0 (dilation)
: &quot;p&quot; → &quot;q&quot; = ( &quot;r&quot; −1 cos &quot;a&quot;, &quot;r&quot; −1 sin &quot;a&quot; ) (inversion in unit semicircle).
Note: the shift and dilation are mappings from inversive geometry composed of a pair of reflections in vertical lines or concentric circles respectively.

===Use of semi-circle Z===
Consider the triangle {(0,0),(1,0),(1,tan &quot;a&quot;)}. Since 1 + tan2&quot;a&quot; = sec2&quot;a&quot;, the length of the triangle hypotenuse is sec &quot;a&quot;, where sec denotes the secant function. Set &quot;r&quot; = sec &quot;a&quot; and apply the third fundamental hyperbolic motion to obtain &quot;q&quot; = (&quot;r&quot; cos &quot;a&quot;, &quot;r&quot; sin &quot;a&quot;) where &quot;r&quot; = sec−1&quot;a&quot; = cos &quot;a&quot;. Now
:|&quot;q&quot; – (½, 0)|2 = (cos2&quot;a&quot; – ½)2 +cos2&quot;a&quot; sin2&quot;a&quot; = ¼

so that &quot;q&quot; lies on the semicircle &quot;Z&quot; of radius ½ and center (½, 0). Thus the tangent ray at (1, 0) gets mapped to &quot;Z&quot; by the third fundamental hyperbolic motion. Any semicircle can be re-sized by a dilation to radius ½ and shifted to &quot;Z&quot;, then the inversion carries it to the tangent ray. So the collection of hyperbolic motions permutes the semicircles with diameters on &quot;y&quot; = 0 sometimes with vertical rays, and vice versa. Suppose one agrees to measure length on vertical rays by using logarithmic measure:
:&quot;d&quot;((&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;),(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;z&quot;)) = |log(&quot;z&quot;/&quot;y&quot;)|.

Then by means of hyperbolic motions one can measure distances between points on semicircles too: first move the points to &quot;Z&quot; with appropriate shift and dilation, then place them by inversion on the tangent ray where the logarithmic distance is known.

For &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; in HP, let &quot;b&quot; be the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. If &quot;b&quot; is parallel to the abscissa, then &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are connected by a vertical ray, otherwise &quot;b&quot; intersects the abscissa so there is a semicircle centered at this intersection that passes through &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. The set HP becomes a metric space when equipped with the distance &quot;d&quot;(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) for &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot; ∈ HP as found on the vertical ray or semicircle. One calls the vertical rays and semicircles the &quot;hyperbolic lines&quot; in HP.
The geometry of points and hyperbolic lines in HP is an example of a non-Euclidean geometry; nevertheless, the construction of the line and distance concepts for HP relies heavily on the original geometry of Euclid.

==Disk model motions==
Consider the disk D = {&quot;z&quot; ∈ C : &quot;z z&quot;* &lt; 1 } in the complex plane C. The geometric plane of Lobachevsky can be displayed in D with circular arcs perpendicular to the boundary of D signifying &quot;hyperbolic lines&quot;. Using the arithmetic and geometry of complex numbers, and Möbius transformations, there is the Poincaré disc model of the hyperbolic plane:

Suppose &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are complex numbers with &quot;a a&quot;* − &quot;b b&quot;* = 1. Note that
:|&quot;bz&quot; + &quot;a&quot;*|2 − |&quot;az&quot; + &quot;b&quot;*|2 = (&quot;aa&quot;* − &quot;bb&quot;*)(1 − |&quot;z&quot;|2),
so that |&quot;z&quot;| &lt; 1 implies |(&quot;a&quot;z + &quot;b&quot;*)/(&quot;bz&quot; + &quot;a&quot;*)| &lt; 1 . Hence the disk D is an invariant set of the Möbius transformation
:f(&quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;az&quot; + &quot;b&quot;*)/(&quot;bz&quot; + &quot;a&quot;*).
Since it also permutes the hyperbolic lines, we see that these transformations are motions of the D model of hyperbolic geometry. A complex matrix 
:formula_2
with &quot;aa&quot;* − &quot;bb&quot;* = 1, which is an element of the special unitary group SU(1,1).

<text>Queen Elizabeth are a British band. It is a collaborative experimental project between Thighpaulsandra and Julian Cope. The general concept behind Queen Elizabeth was a &quot;sonic ritual&quot; in which sounds, melodies and other sonic properties would combine. Both releases, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and 1997&#x27;s double-disc &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2: Elizabeth Vagina&quot;, consist mostly of half-hour-long tracks which contrast experimental ambient music with short bursts of Krautrock. The three discs (and seven tracks) are the band&#x27;s only studio output, yet &quot;Beneath the Frozen Lake of Stars&quot;, which appeared on Thighpaulsandra&#x27;s &quot;I, Thighpaulsandra&quot;, was a revamped version of a track destined for a third Queen Elizabeth release. Cope has said that Thighpaulsandra&#x27;s version went above and beyond the original recording they made together.

In 2009, a recording of the band&#x27;s only live performance in May 2000 was released as an mp3 download entitled &quot;Hall&quot; through Cope&#x27;s official website.

<doc id="1229420" wikidata="Q1777479" url="?curid=1229420" title="Manuel Zeno Gandía">
<text>Manuel Zeno Gandía (January 10, 1855 – January 30, 1930) was a Puerto Rican physician, poet, novelist, journalist and politician. He is best known as the author of &quot;La Charca&quot; (The Pond), a novel considered by many to be the first Puerto Rican novel.

==Early years==
Zeno Gandía was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, to wealthy land-owning parents. After receiving his primary and secondary education in his hometown, he went to Spain where he studied medicine at the University of Barcelona&#x27;s school of medicine. He graduated with the titles of Doctor in Medicine and Surgeon. He developed his love for political literature during his stay in Spain. His interest in politics led him to become an outspoken advocate for Puerto Rican independence. Eduardo Neumann Gandía was his cousin.

==Physician, poet and novelist==
When Zeno Gandía returned to Puerto Rico, he set up his medical practice in the city of Ponce. While in Ponce, Zeno Gandia was medical director at the Port of Ponce &quot;in the years up to 1895&quot;. It was during this time that Zeno Gandia wrote &quot;La Charca.&quot; In 1894, he published &quot;La Charca&quot; (The Pond), &quot;Considered the greatest Puerto Rican novel of the 19th century&quot;. The novel&#x27;s plot deals with the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico. This naturalist novel speaks of the injustices the poor farm worker suffered at the hands of rich landowners. &quot;La Charca&quot; is a Puerto Rican classic and is one of four novels in &quot;Las Crónicas de un Mundo enfermo&quot; (Chronicles of a Sick World). The other three are &quot;Garduña&quot;, &quot;El Negocio&quot; (The Business) and &quot;Redentores&quot; (The Redeemers). These novels were also written while Zeno Gandia was a physician in Barrio Playa, Ponce. &quot;El Negocio&quot; was published in 1922. In the 1960s, Zeno Gandía&#x27;s best-known novel, &quot;La Charca&quot; was translated to English by Kal Wagenheim. In English, it remains in print as &quot;The Pond&quot;, and is published by Markus Wiener Publishers of Princeton, New Jersey. Zeno Gandia had published many poems prior to writing &quot;La Charca.&quot; Among these poems were &quot;La Señora Duquesa&quot; and &quot;Abismo.&quot;

==Journalist==
While in Ponce, Zeno Gandia was already politically active and, as many others during this time in Puerto Rico, he used the press to publish his political ideas. With Amy Braschi, he founded in Ponce the paper &quot;El Estudio&quot; in 1896. Around 1900, he also founded &quot;La Opinion&quot; and led it as its editor. In 1902, he then bought &quot;La Correspondencia&quot; and directed it until 1914. To keep up with his growing journalism business, he imported Puerto Rico&#x27;s first monotype press and its first Rotary printing press.

==Politician and independence advocate==
Zeno Gandia was the first Puerto Rican to propose the creation of an independence party for Puerto Rico. After Puerto Rico was invaded by American forces during the Spanish–American War in 1898, Zeno Gandía traveled to Washington, D.C. where, together with Eugenio María de Hostos, he proposed the idea of independence for Puerto Rico. The men were disappointed when their ideas were rejected by the government of the United States and the island was converted into a territory. Zeno Gandía returned to the island where he continued to write and was politically active. As a member of the Puerto Rico Union Party, he also advocated allowing voters to choose among non-colonial options, including annexation, an independent protectorate and autonomy. Under the American Government installed in Puerto Rico, Zeno Gandia was a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives in 1900 and in 1907. In 1912, Zeno Gandía joined the Independence Party, a new political party founded by Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón which promoted Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence. That same year, Zeno Gandía together with Matienzo Cintrón and Luis Lloréns Torres wrote a manifesto which stated that it was time for Puerto Rico to have its independence. Their Independence Party, which also included Eugenio Benítez Castaño and Pedro Franceschi as founding members, was the first party in Puerto Rico&#x27;s history to plead for Puerto Rico&#x27;s independence and it established a precedent for future organizations with similar ideologies.

==Legacy==
Zeno Gandía died in Santurce, Puerto Rico, in 1930. He was buried at the Puerto Rico Memorial in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Manuel Zeno Gandía memory was honored by naming a school and avenues after him. In his native Arecibo, the credit cooperative and an industrial park are named after Zeno Gandía.
An statue of him was unveiled on 27 March 2007, by Senate President Kenneth McClintock on the grounds of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Capitol, to honor Zeno Gandía, with Zeno Gandia&#x27;s grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren in attendance. Zeno Gandia is recognized at Ponce&#x27;s Tricentennial Park for his contributions in the field of literature.

<doc id="1229421" wikidata="Q7353277" url="?curid=1229421" title="Robocrane">
<text>The Robocrane is a kind of manipulator resembling a Stewart platform but using an octahedral assembly of cables instead of struts. Like the Stewart platform, the Robocrane has six degrees of freedom (x, y, z, pitch, roll, &amp; yaw).

It was developed by Dr. James S. Albus of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), using the Real-Time Control System which is a hierarchical control system. Given its unusual ability to &quot;fly&quot; tools around a work site, it has many possible applications, including stone carving, ship building, bridge construction, inspection, pipe or beam fitting and welding.

Albus invented and developed a new generation of robot cranes based on six cables and six winches configured as a Stewart platform. The NIST RoboCraneTM has the capacity to lift and precisely manipulate heavy loads over large volumes with fine control in all six degrees of freedom. Laboratory RoboCranes have demonstrated the ability to manipulate tools such as saws, grinders, and welding torches, and to lift and precisely position heavy objects such as steel beams and cast iron pipe. In 1992, the RoboCrane was selected by Construction Equipment magazine as one of the 100 most significant new products of the year for construction and related industries. It was also selected by Popular Science magazine for the &quot;Best of What&#x27;s New&quot; award as one of the 100 top products, technologies, and scientific achievements of 1992.

A version of the RoboCrane has been commercially developed for the United States Air Force to enable rapid paint stripping, inspection, and repainting of very large military aircraft such as the C-5 Galaxy. RoboCrane is expected to save the United States Air Force $8 million annually at each of its maintenance facilities. This project was recognized in 2008 by a National Laboratories Award for technology transfer. Potential future applications of the RoboCrane include ship building, construction of high rise buildings, highways, bridges, tunnels, and port facilities; cargo handling, ship-to-ship cargo transfer on the high seas, radioactive and toxic waste clean-up; and underwater applications such as salvage, drilling, cable maintenance, and undersea waste site management.

<text>Robert Dean Blackwill (born August 8, 1939) is a retired American diplomat, author, senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations, and lobbyist. Blackwill served as the United States Ambassador to India under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2003 and as United States National Security Council Deputy for Iraq from 2003 to 2004, where he was a liaison between Paul Bremer and Condoleezza Rice.

==Early life, education, and Peace Corps service==
Blackwill was born on August 8, 1939, in Kellogg, Idaho and grew up in Kansas. In June 2001, at a Senate confirmation hearings to become ambassador to India, he said, &quot;From my boyhood on the Great Plains, I brought back east more than 30 years ago the values of Kansas and its people: honesty, candor, compassion, hard work, a dogged stamina in the face of challenge and adversity, a sense of humor, a recognition of one&#x27;s own limitations, and a deep and abiding love of country.&quot; He earned a B.A. from Wichita State University.

Blackwill served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Malawi from 1964 to 1966. While in the Peace Corps, he served with writer Paul Theroux, who Blackwill later described as &quot;the glorious American writer who was my friend in the Peace Corps in Africa more than thirty years ago&quot;. In an interview with Rediff News on June 27, 2006, Blackwill was asked if he was still in contact with Theroux, and he replied, &quot;Not recently. But I just finished reading his new novel, &quot;Blinding Light&quot;. It is terrific.&quot;

==Diplomatic career==

===1960s===
In 1967, Blackwill was appointed as a Foreign Service Officer. He served as a training officer in the Bureau of Personnel of the US State Department from 1968 to 1969 and as an associate watch officer in the State Department&#x27;s Operations Center from 1969 to 1970.

===1970s===
Blackwill took Swahili language training in 1970 at the Foreign Service Institute. He served as a political officer in Nairobi, Kenya from 1970 to 1972 and as a staff officer in the Executive Secretariat of the State Department from 1972 to 1973. In 1974, Blackwill was a special assistant to State Department counselor Helmut Sonnenfeldt. While he was a special assistant, Blackwill worked closely with Paul Bremer, who was then a chief aide to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Blackwill and Bremer forged a close relationship through mediating policy differences between their bosses. The two would come to work together again thirty years later in August 2003, when Bremer was named by President George W. Bush to lead the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and Blackwill was named to the National Security Council staff to coordinate between Washington, D.C., and Baghdad. From 1975 to 1978, Blackwill served as a political-military officer in London, England. He served as political counselor in Tel Aviv, Israel from 1978 to 1979. Blackwill became the Director of Western European Affairs on the National Security Council staff at the White House in 1979.

===1980s===
Blackwill served as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs in the State Department in 1981. Blackwill served as principal deputy assistant secretary for European Affairs from 1982 to 1983. After his return from a two-year sabbatical at Harvard University, President Ronald Reagan nominated him to Senior Foreign Service, Class of Minister-Counselor on March 29, 1985, and designated him to be the chief negotiator of the US with the Warsaw Pact for the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions talks. Blackwill served in this position with the rank of Ambassador. On March 13, 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed Blackwill as special assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and as senior director for European and Soviet Affairs.

==Academic career==
From 1983 to 1985, Blackwill took a sabbatical from the State Department and served as associate dean and faculty member at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.

After two years as representative to the Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions Negotiations, Blackwill rejoined the Harvard faculty in 1987. There, he served the Kennedy School as associate dean and the Belfer Lecturer in International Security for fourteen years until 2001. During his tenure, Blackwill taught foreign and defense policy and public policy analysis. He was also faculty chair for executive training programs for business and government leaders from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Palestinian Authority, and Kazakhstan, as well as military General Officers from Russia and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Publications ==
In 2024, Blackwill released &quot;Lost Decade: The U.S. Pivot to Asia and the Rise of Chinese Power&quot; with co-author Richard Fontaine.

==US Ambassador to India==

===Advisor to Bush Campaign===
Blackwill, a Republican, was one of a group of foreign policy experts (along with Condoleezza Rice) who advised Bush during his Presidential campaign in 2000. After the election Blackwill was rewarded with the ambassadorship to India. Rice had previously worked for Blackwill during the first Bush administration when they dealt with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Soviet empire. He had never been to India before his appointment as ambassador, but he sought the assignment because of President Bush&#x27;s designation of India as a &quot;rising great power of the 21st century&quot;.

===Stronger ties with India===
Blackwill was appointed US ambassador to India in June 2001. He was committed to taking India seriously as an American ally as a counterweight to China&#x27;s growing power. Blackwill promoted perhaps the closest ties between India and the United States since India&#x27;s independence in 1947. &quot;The Bush administration perceives India as a strategic opportunity for the United States, not as an irritating recalcitrant&quot;, Blackwill said. Blackwill said that before he arrived, India was considered &quot;a nuclear renegade whose policies threatened the entire nonproliferation regime&quot;. To promote closer ties, the United States lifted economic penalties applied against India after its 1998 nuclear tests. American military forces also conducted six major joint training exercises with India while Blackwill was the ambassador.

====Protests by Muslim fundamentalists====
Muslims protestors belonging to Islamic fundamentalist organizations, Majlis Bachao Tehreek and Tahaffuz-e-Shayar-Islami attacked Blackwill&#x27;s convoy when it was proceeding towards Falaknuma Palace in Hyderabad. The mob was protesting alleged American injustices in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Palestine. Hyderabad Police cleared the mob and allowed the convoy to proceed safely.

===Relations with Pakistan===
One of Blackwill&#x27;s major concerns while ambassador was terrorism in India and relations between India and Pakistan. After a series of terrorist attacks that India blamed on Pakistan, the two countries nearly went to war over Kashmir in June 2002. After Blackwill ordered the evacuation of embassy staff members, an event that was seen as a pressure tactic and partly credited for drawing India back from the war, Blackwill encouraged India to resume dialogue with Pakistan. In a statement on his departure as ambassador, Blackwill said that the fight against international terrorism would not be won until terrorism against India ended. &quot;There can be no other legitimate stance by the United States, no American compromise whatever on this elemental geopolitical and moral truth.&quot; Others thought that Blackwill damaged US relations with Pakistan. Pakistani analyst Ershad Mahmud of the Institute of Policy Studies called Blackwill &quot;Delhi&#x27;s front man rather than U.S. ambassador to India,&quot; and said that Blackwill &quot;even encouraged India to take [a] hostile stance against Pakistan&quot;.

===Appreciation of Indian civilization===
Blackwill had a very high-profile tenure as ambassador to India and displayed a strong appreciation for Indian civilization. Upon his departure as ambassador, Blackwill wrote in an article for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; called &quot;What India Means To Me&quot; writing:

As has been said, the world is divided into two parts —those who have seen the Taj Mahal, and those who have not. I am proud to be in the first, still too exclusive group. The Shatabdi Express transported me there and back in great comfort. A wonderful train. All of Rajasthan entrances me. The noble Rajput legacy. Jaipur. Udaipur. Jodhpur. And perhaps my favourite, the medieval walled city of Jaisalmer, land of the Bhatti princes, born of the moon. Parapets into the sky. On some nights, there must be stars nowhere else above the planet because they all seem to be over Jaisalmer. I am surprised some city in northern Europe has not sued Jaisalmer for stealing all the stars. Be sure and take your sunglasses along when you go there —to deal with the starry nights. Standing in Jaisalmer, close your eyes for a moment and see the camel caravans coming through this desert town a thousand years ago, which I now realise by India&#x27;s civilizational standards is only yesterday —a fellow on the street might have said to me, &#x27;yes, they came through Jaisalmer, just a little while ago.&#x27;

Upon returning to the United States, the only item on Blackwill&#x27;s desk at the National Security Council was a tiny figurine of Ganesh, the Hindu elephant-headed god of wisdom and success while a huge map of &quot;Mother India&quot; adorned the walls of his office.

Historian Ramachandra Guha quoted him saying, &quot;India is a pluralist society that creates magic with democracy, rule of law and individual freedom, community relations and [cultural] diversity. What a place to be an intellectual!. I wouldn&#x27;t mind being born ten times to rediscover India.&quot;

===Controversy over management style===
On April 22, 2003, Blackwill announced that he was resigning as US ambassador to India to return to his academic career at Harvard University. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that there had been complaints about Blackwill&#x27;s management style from embassy staff members that led to a review by the State Department&#x27;s inspector general although after the review the complaints died down. &quot;He&#x27;s extremely bright. He has a very penetrating intellect that produces great ideas&quot;, said one official who worked with him. &quot;He&#x27;s also utterly charming and has more energy than anybody around him. He never sleeps. He&#x27;s a double-A type. But he&#x27;s also a prickly demanding personality who can become impatient with others who don&#x27;t keep up with him. He&#x27;s hard on people because he&#x27;s smart. He wants things now.&quot;

==National Security Council==

===Coordinator for Strategic Planning===
Upon completing his time as ambassador to India, Blackwill was originally planning to return to Harvard&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government until he got the call from National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice asking him to come to Washington. On August 16, 2003, Blackwill was appointed deputy assistant to President George W. Bush as well as coordinator for strategic planning under Rice. Blackwill&#x27;s assignment was to help develop and coordinate the direction of America&#x27;s foreign policy. In his new post on the National Security Council, Blackwill quickly became the alter ego to national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. He was given free rein to track global trends and predict unintended consequences of US foreign policy decisions anywhere in the world by providing long-range planning for a foreign policy team under stress from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

===Envoy to Iraq===
One of Blackwill&#x27;s jobs on the National Security Council in 2003 was to coordinate between Washington and Baghdad working with Paul Bremer to achieve a political handover to Iraq. Blackwill and Bremer had worked together in the State Department in 1974 and shared a conservative view of the world. &quot;Both are basically conservatives&quot;, said one mutual friend. &quot;But it is a 19th-century conservatism -- focused on national interest and power -- not neoconservatism.&quot; He said Bremer and Blackwill &quot;are focused on getting things done. They are not ideological dreamers.&quot; Bob Woodward in his book &quot;State of Denial&quot; reports that in 2003 Blackwill sent a lengthy memorandum to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice warning that more ground troops, perhaps as many as 40,000, were desperately needed in Iraq. Woodward reports that Blackwill and Bremer later briefed Rice and her deputy Stephen J. Hadley about the pressing need for more troops during a secure teleconference from Iraq, but that the White House did nothing in response. President Bush is quoted as saying of the situation in Iraq at that time: &quot;I don&#x27;t want anyone in the cabinet to say it is an insurgency. I don&#x27;t think we are there yet.&quot;

===Alleged abuse of U.S. female staffer and abrupt departure from the Administration===
On November 5, 2004, Blackwill announced his resignation from the administration. He had been mentioned as a possible successor to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice in Bush&#x27;s second term, but he told associates that he had spent six years working for Bush—two years as a foreign policy adviser to his first presidential campaign, two years as ambassador to India and two years at the White House—and that the presidential election seemed like a natural end to this cycle in his life.

On November 12, 2004, Glenn Kessler and Al Kamen reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Condoleezza Rice had interviewed Blackwill and taken action to ensure that he dealt with his colleagues and subordinates appropriately after reports in September 2004 that he appeared to have verbally abused and physically hurt a female embassy staffer during a visit to Kuwait. The incident took place when Blackwill was returning from a visit to Baghdad and arrived at the Air France counter at the Kuwait airport to learn he was not on the flight manifest. Blackwill turned in fury to an embassy secretary and demanded that he be given a seat on the flight, grabbing her arm at one point, an official said. Anger at the top of the State Department was palpable, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. &quot;...Senior officials at the State Department took her concerns seriously. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage called her on Powell&#x27;s behalf and expressed regret for the incident. Armitage then visited her and her husband during a recent trip to Kuwait to assure her that her concerns were being addressed, the State Department official said.&quot; A spokesman for the National Security Council said the incident was not the reason Blackwill abruptly quit his job. &quot;Ambassador Blackwill has served the country with great distinction, including intense and dangerous situations in Iraq&quot;, the NSC spokesman said. &quot;The president and Dr. Rice hold Ambassador Blackwill in the highest regard, and the decision to leave was Ambassador Blackwill&#x27;s own.&quot;

==Lobbyist career==
In November 2004, Blackwill joined the lobbying firm Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers (BGR). On October 29, 2007, the &quot;New York Times&quot; disclosed that lobbying disclosure reports at the Justice Department show that Mr. Blackwill helped bring in more than $11 million in fees from foreign clients since late 2005.

===Lobbying for India===
On January 5, 2005, the &quot;Telegraph of India&quot; reported that Blackwill was traveling to India on a trip linked to India&#x27;s $600,000-a-year contract with the Washington lobbying firm, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld that had expired in April 2004. On March 23, 2005, the &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; reported that Blackwill had spoken to the Confederation of Indian Industry in Bangalore saying that the US should enter into a long-term program of space co-operation with India, and lift restrictions on the assistance given to civilian nuclear industry and hi-tech trade. &quot;We should sell India civil nuclear reactors, both to reduce its demand for Persian Gulf energy and to ease the environmental impact of India&#x27;s vibrant economic growth.&quot; On August 31, 2005, the &quot;Daily Times of Pakistan&quot; reported that Barbour, Griffith, and Rogers had won a contract to help get an Indo-US nuclear deal through Congress.

On December 27, 2007, the &quot;Daily Times&quot; of Pakistan published a story saying that Blackwill was on the payroll of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman providing lobbying services for them for large defense contracts from the Indian government. Lockheed Martin was going after a $10 billion contract from the Indian Air Force, for the provision of 126 fighters while Northrop Grumman was trying to acquire contracts for selling high-end radars to India. &quot;The government has no business appointing an agent of American arms companies as their own agent, especially when those companies are vying for Indian contracts,&quot; said Indian attorney Prashant Bhushan.

On April 20, 2008, &quot;The Times of India&quot; reported that Blackwill said that the next US President may not push the nuclear deal with India because he will not have the same sunk costs in the agreement as President Bush. &quot;If I may be characteristically blunt, the next American president will not have the same sunk costs in the US-India civil nuclear agreement that this president (George W Bush) and the top of the administration has,&quot; Blackwill said. &quot;India will pay a substantial price in its future energy policy, and its lack of civil nuclear assistance from the outside world.&quot; Blackwill added that the next US President would not go back to lecturing India about its nuclear program. &quot;They (Indians) did not have much tolerance before, and they have none now. That would be a substantial irritant in the relationship if it were to occur,&quot; said Blackwill.

===Contract with Ayad Allawi===
On August 28, 2007, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that Blackwill was handling the $300,000 lobbying contract at Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers International to destabilize Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and replace him with the firm&#x27;s new client, Ayad Allawi. The contract, filed with the Justice Department, states that &quot;B.G.R. will provide strategic counsel and representation for and on behalf of Dr. Ayad Allawi before the U.S. government, Congress, media and others.&quot; Allawi disclosed that Blackwill—whom he described as a &quot;dear friend&quot;—had raised the idea that the former Iraqi prime minister hire his firm. &quot;He contacted me&quot;, Allawi said. &quot;We were having lunch ... He spoke to me and he said ... there is a vacuum in Washington, and we will be able to help and assist. We know your views. We know the views of your people and we are ready to help in getting your message across to the United States.&quot;

===Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq===
The Regional Government has paid Barbour Griffith &amp; Rogers $1.4 million since 2005. &quot;We have had a long-term relationship with the firm&quot;, said Qubad Talabani, the Washington representative of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq. Kurdistan is pushing for Washington&#x27;s support of its oil contracts with foreign companies.

===Thaksin Shinawatra===
Blackwill represents Thaksin Shinawatra. Shinawatra was a billionaire communications tycoon who became prime minister of Thailand and was ousted in a coup in 2006. On the evening of 19 September 2006, while Thaksin was visiting New York City, to attend a United Nations summit and to speak at the Council on Foreign Relations, the army took control of Bangkok.

===Other clients===
On October 29, 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; disclosed that Blackwill&#x27;s other clients include Serbia, China, and the Alfa-Bank in Moscow.

Blackwill&#x27;s firm previously had lobbying contracts, now expired, with the secular National Dialogue Party of Lebanon, the Confederation of Indian Industry, Dubai International Capital (the private equity firm of Dubai&#x27;s ruler, Sheik Muhammad bin Rashid al-Maktoum), and Eritrea, a nation the State Department has been threatening to designate a terrorist state.

===Departure from Barbour Griffiths Rogers===
On April 19, 2008, &quot;The Times of India&quot; reported that Blackwill was leaving the lobbying firm of Barbour Griffiths Rogers International to go to work as a senior fellow at RAND Corporation, one of the United States&#x27; premier think tanks. &quot;I will be leaving BGR to join Rand Corporation in California, as senior fellow,&quot; said Blackwill. &quot;I now feel the compelling need for sustained time to reflect and write about America&#x27;s role in the world in this difficult and dangerous period.&quot; In September 2010, Blackwill rejoined the Council on Foreign Relations as the Henry Kissinger Senior Fellow.

==Punditry==

===Relations with Pakistan===
On October 21, 2007, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported on the &quot;nightmare scenario&quot; in Pakistan in the aftermath of the carnage after bombs exploded killing and wounding hundreds of supporters of Benazir Bhutto after her arrival in Pakistan. &quot;We have to remember that the U.S. doesn&#x27;t have much capability to affect internal developments&quot; in Pakistan, said Robert Blackwill. &quot;What I am struck by are the trends we see today: the North-West Province is ungovernable and a sanctuary for terrorists. The politics are fractured and deeply unstable, Musharraf is weaker, and the army is uncertain which way it will go.&quot;

<text>The Menexenus (; ) is a Socratic dialogue of Plato, traditionally included in the seventh tetralogy along with the &quot;Greater&quot; and &quot;Lesser Hippias&quot; and the &quot;Ion&quot;. The speakers are Socrates and Menexenus, who is not to be confused with Socrates&#x27; son Menexenus. The Menexenus of Plato&#x27;s dialogue appears also in the &quot;Lysis&quot;, where he is identified as the &quot;son of Demophon&quot;, as well as the &quot;Phaedo&quot;.

The &quot;Menexenus&quot; consists mainly of a lengthy funeral oration, referencing the one given by Pericles in Thucydides&#x27; account of the Peloponnesian War. Socrates here delivers to Menexenus a speech that he claims to have learned from Aspasia, a consort of Pericles and prominent female Athenian philosopher.

&quot;Menexenus&quot; is unique among the Platonic dialogues in that the actual &#x27;dialogue&#x27; serves primarily as exposition for the oration. For this reason, perhaps, the &quot;Menexenus&quot; has come under some suspicion of illegitimacy, although Aristotle&#x27;s invocation of the text on multiple occasions seems to reinforce its authenticity. Much of the interest in the &quot;Menexenus&quot; stems from the fact that it is one of the few extant sources on the practice of Athenian funeral oratory, even though it parodies the medium. 

== Synopsis ==

Socrates encounters Menexenus, who was coming from Athens&#x27; Council Chamber, and asks him what had transpired there. Menexenus replies that the Council was arranging for the burial of those fallen in battle and was about to select someone to make the funeral oration, but he is afraid that the orators are not well prepared (235c). Socrates asserts that a speech like this one should not be difficult to compose, and that even &quot;he&quot; could have done it, having been instructed in these matters by Aspasia herself, who according to Socrates, and probably with a sense of irony, has taught the best orator of them all, Pericles (235e). In fact, Socrates claims that Aspasia had prepared a whole speech which she had entrusted him with. In all probability, Socrates&#x27; claim is a literary device that Plato uses, as some of the events that will be mentioned in the speech happened after Aspasia’s death. Menexenus is eager to listen but Socrates is reluctant at first, as he believes that Aspasia might become angry at him for publishing her speech. He finally consents and begins the delivery.

Like Pericles&#x27; Funeral Oration that her speech is supposed to be mimicking, Aspasia&#x27;s oration is composed of a eulogy to the city of Athens. It begins by affirming the noble birth of the fallen together with their purity of blood. The speech also affirms the peculiar concept of autochthony (237b), by which Athenians never came from elsewhere but had “sprung from the very ground” of their city. The speech continues by recounting Athens&#x27; defence of Europe against the Persian Empire, first at Marathon and then at Salamis, proving to the rest of the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten. After displaying such bravery however, Athens became an object of envy, and so the city had to fight against her former allies (242a-b). As the Peloponnesian War broke out, Athens proved her character yet again at Sphacteria when it refused to kill the Spartan captives (242c).

Finally, the speech ends by claiming to deliver &quot;verbatim&quot; to the new generations the final words of those who had previously risked their lives for freedom (246d). They were: to live bravely, for neither money nor beauty is good without virtue, and to strive to exceed their forefathers, who would happily be &quot;defeated&quot; in this noble manner. The ancient saying &quot;nothing overmuch&quot; (μηδὲν ἄγαν) is wise indeed, and true character is shown by those who neither rejoice in excess when fortunate nor grieve too much in misfortune (248a). These were their ancestors&#x27; words. 

Menexenus finds the speech to be marvellous and wonders ever more to the claim that it was composed by a woman. Yet, knowing Aspasia&#x27;s quality, he is convinced (249e), and says that he will keep Socrates&#x27; secret of having shared her with him.

<text>HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; was a fourth-rate wooden-hulled screw frigate of the Royal Navy, with a steam engine that could make over . She was launched at Chatham in 1853, was 212 feet long, displaced 3,125 tons and had a complement of 515 (this varied slightly as the Naval Standards varied). At the time of the Bombardment of Kagoshima she carried 35 guns, not counting approximately 16 carronades. Seventeen of her guns were breech-loading Armstrong guns. She carried 230 tons of coal, and provisions for about three months, together with over 70 tons of shot and shell.

==Service history==
In December 1853, G. Ramsay was appointed captain. The ship served in the Baltic Campaign in 1854–1855.

On 2 April 1855 she gave HMS &quot;Imperieuse&quot; a tow, after the ship had run aground; the previous day, off the Reefness Lighthouse (Røsnæs lighthouse) in Kalundborg, Denmark.

As part of the Anglo-French fleet, she took part in the bombardment of Sveaborg (now Suomenlinna, Finland) on 7–9 August 1855.
Under the command of J. W. Tarleton, she served in the Mediterranean in 1858. The same year Prince Alfred was appointed to the ship as a midshipman. In 1860, the ship visited the Cape of Good Hope.

&quot;Euryalus&quot; arrived at Yokohama on 15 September 1862, the day following the Namamugi Incident, a samurai assault on British nationals on the outskirts of the treaty port that led to a major breakdown in Anglo-Japanese relations. In an effort to enforce reparations from the Satsuma Domain, &quot;Euryalus&quot; served as Admiral Sir Augustus Kuper&#x27;s flagship during the bombardment of Kagoshima on 16 August 1863. During the bombardment of Kagoshima the Captain of &quot;Euryalus&quot;, John James Steven Josling, was killed, as was his second-in-command, Commander Edward Wilmot, both decapitated by the same cannonball. Eight other members of the crew also died in the action, their names all commemorated on a memorial in the former British Consulate building in Yokohama.

&quot;Euryalus&quot; also participated in the bombardment of Shimonoseki in September 1864. The captain and commander of the ship at Shimonoseki was Captain John Hobhouse Inglis Alexander, who was severely wounded in the ankle as he led the assault on the batteries onshore. The &quot;Euryalus&quot; Captain of the Afterguard, Thomas Pride, was awarded a Victoria Cross for his actions during one of the stormings at Shimonoseki. It was at Shimonoseki that Duncan Gordon Boyes won his Victoria Cross at the age of 17.

== Fate ==
&quot;Euryalus&quot; was paid off at Portsmouth on 23 September 1865. She was broken up in 1867.

<doc id="1229437" wikidata="Q957639" url="?curid=1229437" title="William Hopper">
<text>William DeWolf Hopper Jr. (January 26, 1915 – March 6, 1970) was an American stage, film, and television actor. The only child of actor DeWolf Hopper and actress and Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, he appeared in more than 80 feature films in the 1930s and 1940s. After serving in the United States Navy during World War II, he left acting, but was persuaded by director William Wellman in the 1950s to resume his film career. He’s perhaps best known for his portrayal of private detective Paul Drake in the CBS television series &quot;Perry Mason&quot;.

==Early life==
William DeWolf Hopper Jr., was born January 26, 1915, in New York City. He was the only child of actor, singer, comedian, and theatrical producer DeWolf Hopper and his fifth wife, actress Hedda Hopper (born Elda Furry). He had a half-brother, John A. Hopper, from his father&#x27;s second marriage in the 1880s.

Hopper made his film debut as a baby in his father&#x27;s 1916 silent movie &quot;Sunshine Dad&quot;. His mother divorced his father in 1922 and took Hopper to live in Hollywood. Hedda Hopper became a gossip columnist with nearly 30 million readers in newspapers in the U.S., and was a proponent of the Hollywood blacklist.

==Career==
===1930s–1940s===
Hopper began his acting career as a teenager. He made his first stage appearance at the Pasadena Community Playhouse, in &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot;. He worked in summer stock in Ogunquit, Maine. He appeared on Broadway in &quot;Order Please&quot; (1934) and as a member of the ensemble in Katharine Cornell&#x27;s production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1934–35).

In 1936, Hopper won a contract at Paramount Pictures. He was credited in movies as Wolfe Hopper and DeWolf Hopper. In 1936, he appeared in &quot;The King Steps Out&quot;, and in 1937 he was in &quot;Public Wedding,&quot; &quot;Over the Goal,&quot; &quot;The Footloose Heiress&quot; and in 1938, &quot;Mystery House&quot;.

Hopper&#x27;s film roles included &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939), &quot;The Return of Dr. X&quot; (1939), &quot;Over the Goal&quot; (1939), &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot; (1940), &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941) and &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; (1942).

Hopper became an actor because his mother expected it of him. &quot;When I worked at Warner Bros.,&quot; Hopper said, &quot;I was so scared I stuttered all the time.&quot;

===Military service and postwar career===
Hopper served with the United States Navy during World War II, as a volunteer with the Office of Strategic Services and as a member of the newly created Underwater Demolition Team. He received a Bronze Star and several other medals during operations in the Pacific.

For eight years after the war, Hopper became involved in business and sold cars in Hollywood. He combined car sales and acting when opportunities came up during the advent of television.

&quot;I didn&#x27;t even think about acting much until a friend, director Bill Wellman, asked me to do a part in &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;,&quot; Hopper recalled.

===1950s===
In 1953, director William Wellman persuaded Hopper to resume his movie career with his 1954 film, &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;, opposite Jan Sterling. Before filming began, Hopper challenged Wellman because he suspected his mother had arranged the offer. &quot;When it appeared Wellman was serious, I asked him if he knew whose son I was. He ignored me,&quot; Hopper recalled. &quot;I was so lousy, so nervous, I didn&#x27;t even know where the camera was. But somehow Billy got me through. Afterward, I thanked him. He said, &#x27;Thank me, my foot. After this, you&#x27;re going to be in every picture I make.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t believe him.&quot; Hopper subsequently appeared in two of Wellman&#x27;s films, &quot;Track of the Cat&quot; (1954) and &quot;Good-bye, My Lady&quot; (1956).

Hopper was cast to star opposite Claire Trevor in the live television drama &quot;No Sad Songs for Me&quot;, broadcast April 14, 1955, on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;. He had such stage fright, he initially cancelled: &quot;I swore I&#x27;d never act again as long as I lived&quot;, Hopper recalled. &quot;Then I thought, what the heck, they can&#x27;t shoot me, and walked on the set. Something happened then. It was as if someone had surgically removed the nerves.&quot;

At last comfortable on screen, Hopper played the stern and emotionally distant father of Natalie Wood in the James Dean classic &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955), and the absentee father in &quot;The Bad Seed&quot; (1956). He starred in the science-fiction films &quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot; and &quot;The Deadly Mantis&quot;, released in 1957.

In 1956 Hopper guest-starred again on television during the first season of the Western series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, portraying an outlaw initially supported by townsfolk in an episode titled &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. He returned that year as murdering outlaw “Tasker” in S1E38’s “Unknown Grave”. The following year he played a supporting role in the pilot episode of the television series &quot;The Restless Gun&quot;, which was broadcast as an episode of &quot;Schlitz Playhouse of Stars&quot;. Some of Hopper&#x27;s other television guest appearances include &quot;The Joseph Cotten Show: On Trial&quot;, &quot;Fury&quot;, &quot;Studio 57&quot;, and &quot;The Millionaire&quot;.

====&quot;Perry Mason&quot;====
Hopper is best known for his principal role as the private investigator Paul Drake on CBS&#x27;s courtroom television series &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (1957–66). He initially tested for the title role, while Raymond Burr read for the role of Mason&#x27;s courtroom adversary, district attorney Hamilton Burger. Burr was encouraged to lose weight and return to audition for the role of Perry Mason – which he did, successfully. Hopper, too, was called back. Executive producer Gail Patrick Jackson recalled, &quot;When Bill Hopper came in to read for Paul Drake he blurted out, &#x27;You hate my mother.&#x27; And that was Hedda Hopper. Well, I disliked what she stood for, but &#x27;hate&#x27; is something else — and anyway he was perfect as Drake, and we got him.&quot;

Wrote Brian Kelleher and Diana Merrill in their chronicle of the television series:
 As Paul Drake, William Hopper was called on to be the most versatile of the principals in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; cast. He was not only the careful investigator, the duke-it-out tough guy, the ladies&#x27; man, and the hipster, but also the fall guy, the strikeout artist, the &quot;eating machine&quot; and &quot;the big kid.&quot; Hopper&#x27;s Drake alone provided the comic relief for the show. And, despite being a rather late bloomer to the acting field, he played all the parts surprisingly well and believably. His appearances made fair shows good, and good shows better.

A 1959 episode, &quot;The Case of Paul Drake&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, had Hopper&#x27;s character on trial for murder.

Hopper continued to work in summer stock and to make movie appearances during his years on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;; however, after the series was cancelled in 1966, he declined other television offers. He did, though, make one final film appearance in &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (1970), which premiered in New York three months after his death.

==Awards and honors==
In 1959, Hopper was nominated as Best Supporting Actor (Continuing Character) in a Dramatic Series at the 11th Primetime Emmy Awards for his performance as Paul Drake.

==Personal life==
In 1940, Hopper married actress Jane Gilbert. They had worked together on the 1939 film &quot;Invisible Stripes&quot;. The couple had one daughter, Joan.

In September 1962, &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine reported that Hopper and Gilbert had separated. They later divorced, and Hopper married Jeanette Juanita Ward. They remained together until his death.

==Death==
Hopper entered Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, California, on February 14, 1970, after suffering a stroke. He died of pneumonia three weeks later, on March 6, at the age of 55. He was buried in Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.

<text>Charles Wirgman (31 August 1832 - 8 February 1891) was an English artist, caricaturist and editorial cartoonist, the creator of the &quot;Japan Punch&quot; and illustrator in China and Meiji period-Japan for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;.

Wirgman was the eldest son of Ferdinand Charles Wirgman (1806–57) and brother of Theodore Blake Wirgman. He married Ozawa Kane in 1863, and the couple had one son.

Wirgman arrived in Japan in 1861 as a correspondent for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, and resided in Yokohama from 1861 until his death. He published the first magazine in Japan, the &quot;Japan Punch&quot;, monthly between 1862 and spring 1887. Like its British namesake, the magazine was written in a humorous, often satirical manner, and was illustrated with Wirgman&#x27;s cartoons. 

Wirgman formed a partnership called &quot;Beato &amp; Wirgman, Artists and Photographers&quot; with Felice Beato from 1864 to 1867. Wirgman again produced illustrations derived from Beato&#x27;s photographs while Beato photographed some of Wirgman&#x27;s sketches and other works. 

Wirgman taught western-style drawing and painting techniques to a number of Japanese artists, possibly including the ukiyo-e artist Kobayashi Kiyochika. From 1865 he had Goseda Yoshimatsu and Kanō Tomonobu as his pupils. In 1866 he taught Takahashi Yuichi, sponsoring his work for the International Exposition of 1867. He also was briefly an English tutor, most notably to the future Admiral Tōgō, then a young cadet.

In the 1860s, he accompanied British envoy Sir Ernest Satow on a number of journeys around Japan as described in Satow&#x27;s &quot;Diplomat in Japan&quot;.

Wirgman&#x27;s grave is in the Yokohama Foreign General Cemetery.

<doc id="1229441" wikidata="Q840423" url="?curid=1229441" title="Byblis (plant)">
<text>Byblis ( ) is a small genus of carnivorous plants, sometimes termed the rainbow plants for the attractive appearance of their mucilage-covered leaves in bright sunshine. Native to Australia and New Guinea, it is the only genus in the family Byblidaceae. The first species in the genus was described by the English botanist Richard Anthony Salisbury in 1808. Eight species are now recognised.

&quot;Byblis&quot; species look very similar to &quot;Drosera&quot; and &quot;Drosophyllum&quot;, but are distinguished by their zygomorphic flowers, with five curved stamens off to one side of the pistil. These genera are in fact not closely related; modern classifications place &quot;Byblis&quot; in the Lamiales, while the sundews and &quot;Drosophyllum&quot; are now placed in the Caryophyllales.

==Plant characteristics==
All species of the genus form upright growth supported by a weak, fibrous root system. The genus can be divided into two groups or &quot;complexes&quot;: The &quot;B. liniflora&quot; complex and the &quot;B. gigantea&quot; complex.

===Leaves===
The leaves of all species are round in cross section and highly elongated, tapering at the end. The surface of the leaves is densely studded with glandular hairs which secrete a mucilaginous substance from their tip. These serve to attract small insects, which upon touching the sticky secretions are ensnared. Unless they are strong enough to escape, the insect prey either die of exhaustion or asphyxiate as the mucilage envelops them and clogs their spiracles.

Along with the stalked mucilaginous glands, the leaves are also equipped with sessile glands, which assumedly are responsible for the secretion of the digestive juices. Sessile glands are five to ten times as numerous as the stalked glands.

&quot;Byblis&quot; were previously grouped among the &#x27;passive flypaper traps&#x27; along with &quot;Pinguicula&quot;, &quot;Drosophyllum&quot;, &quot;Roridula&quot;, &quot;Stylidium&quot; and &quot;Triphyophyllum peltatum&quot; as the plants were believed to be capable of moving neither their leaves nor tentacles to aid in prey capture or digestion. However, research in 2019 showed that the tentacles of &quot;Byblis liniflora&quot; collapse following exposure to food, bringing the prey item into contact with the sessile digestive glands. The same behaviour was later observed in &quot;B. gigantea&quot;.

===Flowers===
Flowers in this genus are borne singly at the end of unbranching, leaf-like inflorescences which emerge from the leaf axils. The five-petaled flowers are generally purple to pale violet, though &quot;B. gigantea&quot; and &quot;B. filifolia&quot; can sometimes produce white flowers. Except for the self-fertile &quot;B. liniflora&quot;, all species require pollen from other individuals for fertilization. The pollen release of &quot;B. gigantea&quot; and &quot;B. lamellata&quot; is only triggered by the resonance frequency of the wings of a landing pollinator, helping ensure cross-pollination with other individuals. The flowers of &quot;Byblis&quot; start to bloom in early spring and last until late summer.
===Fruit and seeds===
Fertilized flowers mature to form an egg-shaped, two-parted seed capsule. As the seed capsule dries out it cracks open (dehisces), dropping the seed on the ground. The black seeds are generally round and often bear webbed surface markings, although those of &quot;B. lamellata&quot; are strongly ridged. The germination of many species is brought on by bush fires after the dry period; chemicals in the smoke are responsible for triggering germination.

==Distribution and habitat==

All &quot;Byblis&quot; species are native to Australia. &quot;B. gigantea&quot; and &quot;B. lamellata&quot; are endemic to the Perth region of southwest Australia, while the species making up the &quot;B. liniflora&quot; complex are found only in north Australia. The exception here is &quot;B. liniflora&quot; itself, whose distribution extends into southern Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.

Like many carnivorous plants, &quot;Byblis&quot; species usually grow in bogs and marshes. They generally prefer seasonally wet sandy soil in partial or direct sunlight with temperatures between ~ .

==Environmental status==
As native plants of Australia, all &quot;Byblis&quot; species are protected. Until the year 2000, they were also given international protection under CITES appendix II, but were removed from the list when Australia entered the CITES agreement. Since then trade of the genus has been unregulated outside of Australia. However, due to the sensitivity of the plant, interest in the genus has been restricted to a small portion of the carnivorous plant hobbyist community. The majority of plant material sold today is produced in cultivation, with the annual &quot;B. filifolia&quot; and &quot;B. liniflora&quot; being the most common. Most of the other species must be grown from seed, which is often collected from the wild for this purpose.

The West Australian species &quot;B. gigantea&quot; und &quot;B. lamellata&quot; are being threatened by habitat destruction for urban sprawl from cities such as Perth. Particularly damaging is the draining of wet habitats to produce arable land. &quot;B. gigantea&quot; is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s Red List of Threatened Species and is considered critically endangered.

==Carnivorous or protocarnivorous==
The status of the genus as a truly carnivorous plant has been repeatedly put into question. In their natural habitat, all species have been observed playing host to live bugs of the genus &quot;Setocoris&quot;, which nourished themselves by eating prey caught by the plants. Following this discovery it was assumed that, as with the genus &quot;Roridula&quot;, the plants do not actually digest their prey themselves, rather relying on the bugs to do that. The plants, it was reasoned, benefited by absorbing nutrients from the excrements of the bugs, either through their leaves or through the ground. An indirect digestion of these nutrients by a chitinase producing fungus was even proposed. It was not until 2005 that direct digestion of insect prey by enzymes secreted by the sessile glands of &quot;B. filifolia&quot; was proven. Soon thereafter similar results were found with &quot;B. liniflora&quot;. These results clearly place this genus among the true carnivorous plants.

== Systematics ==
Molecular genetics studies have placed the genus in the order Lamiales. While its placement within the order is still unclear, it is closely related to Martyniaceae, Lentibulariaceae as well as Gesneriaceae.

For a time, the genus &quot;Roridula&quot; was also assigned to the family Byblidaceae. Since that time, however, it has been placed into its own family, Roridulaceae.

Traditionally the genus was divided into only two species, namely &quot;B. gigantea&quot; and &quot;B. liniflora&quot;. Further species were described in the 1980s, particularly through the work of the Australian botanist Allen Lowrie. Eight species are currently recognised:

* &quot;Byblis aquatica&quot; (annual, scrambling stem up to , semiaquatic habitats)
* &quot;Byblis filifolia&quot; (annual, up to , anthers longer than filaments)
* &quot;Byblis gigantea&quot; (perennial, up to , seeds with honeycomb pattern)
* &quot;Byblis guehoi&quot;
* &quot;Byblis lamellata&quot; (perennial, up to , deeply ridged seeds)
* &quot;Byblis liniflora&quot; (annual, up to , anthers shorter than filaments)
* &quot;Byblis pilbarana&quot;
* &quot;Byblis rorida&quot; (annual, up to , heavily set with glandular tentacles)

==Subdivision of the genus==
===&quot;Byblis liniflora&quot; complex===
The four species of this complex, &quot;B. liniflora&quot;, &quot;B. rorida&quot;, &quot;B. filifolia&quot; and &quot;B. aquatica&quot;, are annual herbaceous plants that reach a height of and a maximum leaf length of . These species grow from seedlings to flowering plants in only a few months, setting seed and dying with the onset of the dry season. The original haploid chromosome count of this complex is x=8. The diploid number is therefore 2n=16, whereas the tetraploid species &quot;B. liniflora&quot; is 2n=32.

=== &quot;Byblis gigantea&quot; complex ===
The remaining two species, &quot;B. lamellata&quot; und &quot;B. gigantea&quot;, make up what is known as the &quot;B. gigantea&quot; complex. These perennial species are both endemic to Southwest Australia, and reach heights of . Unlike the annual members of the &quot;B. liniflora&quot; complex, these species survive the dry season by dying back to an underground rhizome, out of which they emerge come fall. The leaves of this complex can reach in length. The base chromosome count of the complex is x=9; since both species are diploid, their chromosome count is 2n=18.

==Paleobotany==
In the year 2004 a single fossil of a seed, resembling that of members of the modern day &quot;B. liniflora&quot; complex, was discovered in south Australia dating from the middle of the Eocene epoch. The species was assigned to the Byblidaceae as a parataxon of the genus. The sole specimen was unfortunately destroyed in a lab accident shortly after being photographed.

==Etymology==
The Latin generic name &quot;Byblis&quot; originates from a goddess from Greek mythology, of whom Ovid wrote in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (IX, l. 454–664). Byblis, niece of Apollo, fell deeply in love with her twin brother Caunus. At his rejection of her advances, she let forth an endless stream of glistening tears, eventually literally transforming into a spring. The droplets lining the leaves of the &quot;Byblis&quot; are said to resemble those tears.

The English vernacular name - &quot;rainbow plants&quot; - also denotes the mucilaginous droplets which, under the right lighting conditions and viewing angle, sparkle in a rainbow of colors.

<text>Mount Humphreys is a mountain peak in the Sierra Nevada on the Fresno-Inyo county line in the U.S. state of California. It is the 13th highest peak in California (the highest peak that is not a fourteener), and the highest peak in the Bishop area. The mountain was named by the California Geological Survey of 1873 for Andrew A. Humphreys, the chief engineer of the United States Army at the time.

<doc id="1229458" wikidata="Q4928729" url="?curid=1229458" title="Blue-plate special">
<text>A blue-plate special is a discount-priced meal that changes daily. The practice was common from the 1920s in American and Canadian restaurants through the 1950s, especially in diners and greasy spoons. , there are still a few restaurants and diners that offer blue-plate specials under that name, sometimes on blue plates, but it is a vanishing tradition. 

A collection of 1930s prose gives this definition: &quot;A Blue Plate Special is a low-priced daily diner special — a main course with all the , a daily combo, a for two bits.&quot;

==History==
The origin and explanation of the phrase are unclear. 
Etymologist Michael Quinion cites a dictionary entry indicating that the blue plates were, more specifically, inexpensive divided plates that were decorated with a &quot;blue willow&quot; or similar blue pattern, such as those popularized by the more expensive Spode and Wedgwood. One of his correspondents says that the first known use of the term is on an October 22, 1892, Fred Harvey Company restaurant menu and implies that blue-plate specials were regular features at Harvey Houses in the late 19th century. Alternatively, Kevin Reed says that &quot;during the Depression, a manufacturer started making plates with separate sections for each part of a meal — like a TV dinner tray — it seems that for whatever reason they were only available in the color blue.&quot;

The term became common starting in the late 1920s. A May 27, 1926 advertisement in &quot;The New York Times&quot; for &quot;The Famous Old Sea Grill Lobster and Chop House&quot; at 141 West 45th Street promised &quot;A La Carte All Hours&quot;, &quot;Moderate Prices&quot;, and &quot;Blue Plate Specials&quot;. A December 2, 1928, article, lamenting the rise in prices that had made it difficult to &quot;dine on a dime,&quot; praised an Ann Street establishment where one could still get &quot;a steak-and-lots-of-onion sandwich for a dime&quot; and a &quot;big blue-plate special, with meat course and three vegetables, is purchasable for a quarter, just as it has been for the last ten years.&quot; The first book publication of Damon Runyon&#x27;s story, &quot;Little Miss Marker,&quot; was in a 1934 collection titled &quot;Damon Runyon&#x27;s Blue Plate Special&quot;. A Hollywood columnist wrote in 1940, &quot;Every time Spencer Tracy enters the Metro commissary, executives and minor geniuses look up from their blue plate specials to look at the actor and marvel.&quot;

The choice of blue plates, especially during the Great Depression, may have been related to color psychology, as blue is not a color associated with food, and people might want to eat less food when it is presented on an unappealing blue plate instead of a more appealing color.

&quot;No substitutions&quot; was a common policy on blue-plate specials. One 1947 &quot;Candid Microphone&quot; episode features Allen Funt ordering a blue-plate special and trying to talk the waiter into making various changes, such as replacing the vegetable soup with consommé, while the polite but increasingly annoyed waiter tries in vain to explain to Funt that &quot;no substitutions&quot; means what it says. In &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; (1970), the Jack Nicholson character, Bobby Dupea, gets into an argument with the waitress about the “no substitutions” policy. &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot; (1958) by Graham Greene has the following exchange regarding an &quot;American blue-plate lunch&quot;:
==Contemporary usage==

In contemporary usage, a &quot;blue-plate special&quot; can be any inexpensive full meal, a daily special, or merely a whimsical phrase for a home meal composed of odds and ends or leftovers.

===In film and television===
In the 1973 film &quot;The Sting&quot;, Robert Redford&#x27;s character Johnny &quot;Kelly&quot; Hooker orders the blue-plate special at the diner. In the 1974 film &quot;The Front Page&quot;, condemned killer Earl Williams is said to be getting a &quot;95-cent blue plate special from the greasy spoon across the street&quot; for his last meal. In the 1997 movie &quot;Good Will Hunting,&quot; Matt Damon&#x27;s character references a &quot;blue plate special&quot; in one of the movie&#x27;s more memorable monologues when explaining why he does not wish to work for the government. In the television series &quot;Double Dare&quot;, one obstacle on the final course is called the Blue Plate Special. In &quot;The Devil All The Time&quot; (Netflix), Willard is offered the meatloaf &quot;blue plate special&quot; by the waitress in the Wooden Spoon Diner in Meade, Ohio; he opts instead for coffee and a doughnut. In &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Skinner orders a “blue plate special” in a diner, just before getting shot.

===In print===
In Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;Our Man in Havana&quot; (first published in 1958), the protagonist, Mr Wormold, is almost poisoned by a rival while eating a blue-plate lunch at a meeting of the European Traders&#x27; Association.

In the &quot;Blondie&quot; comic strip for July 8, 1964, Dagwood is curious about the blue plate special being served on a white plate, and the explanation is that it&#x27;s named after the cook, Oscar Blueplate.

Richard Bernstein titled his &quot;New York Times&quot; review of Andrew Hurley&#x27;s book &quot;Diners, Bowling Alleys, and Trailer Parks&quot; (2001), &quot;The Red, White and Blue Plate Special&quot;.

Road food experts Jane and Michael Stern titled their guidebook &quot;Blue Plate Specials and Blue Ribbon Chefs: The Heart And Soul of America&#x27;s Great Roadside Restaurants&quot; (2001).

<doc id="1229464" wikidata="Q892841" url="?curid=1229464" title="Bonnyville">
<text>Bonnyville is a town situated in East Northern Alberta, Canada between Cold Lake and St. Paul. The Municipal District (MD) of Bonnyville No. 87 surrounds the community.

The community derives its name from Father Bonnin, a Roman Catholic priest.

== Geography ==
Bonnyville is located on the north shore of Jessie Lake. The lake is an important staging area for thousands of migrating birds, and therefore attracts birdwatchers. Other nearby lakes include Moose Lake and Muriel Lake.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Bonnyville had a population of 6,404 living in 2,537 of its 2,986 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 5,975. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The population of the Town of Bonnyville according to its 2017 municipal census is 6,422, a change of from its 2014 municipal census population of 6,921.

In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Bonnyville recorded a population of 5,975 living in 2,281 of its 2,706 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 6,216. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

=== Population controversy ===
The determination of the Town of Bonnyville&#x27;s population has been subject to controversy since 2006. Statistics Canada&#x27;s February 2017 release of the population and dwelling counts from the 2016 census reported an overall population of 5,417, which was residents fewer than 6,921 permanent residents the municipality counted in its own census conducted in 2014, and less than the 6,216 counted in Statistics Canada&#x27;s 2011 census. The population count as initially reported by Statistics Canada resulted in a change of -12.9%, which gave Bonnyville the distinction of being the municipality in Canada, among those with at least 5,000 inhabitants, that experienced the greatest percentage loss in population between 2011 and 2016. The Town of Bonnyville disputed the 2016 census results and conducted its own census in 2017 that counted a population of 6,422, which was higher than the 2016 population published by Statistics Canada and less than what the town had counted in 2014. Later in 2017, Statistics Canada issued a revised 2016 population count of 5,975 for Bonnyville, higher than the originally reported population of 5,417.

=== Language ===
Although English is the dominant language in Bonnyville, it is home to a notable Franco-Albertan minority. Its most common non-official mother tongues are Tagalog and Ukrainian.

=== Visible minorities and Aboriginals ===
== Economy ==
Bonnyville&#x27;s economy is founded on its nearby petroleum reserves as well as its agricultural sector which consists mostly of grain farming and livestock. 

As Bonnyville sits on the edge of the Athabasca Tar Sands, one of Canada&#x27;s largest crude oil reserves, petrol companies like Imperial Oil and Canadian Natural Resources Limited have invested significantly to tap resources in the area. 

Besides the aforementioned agricultural sectors, the municipality has seen increases in game farming, as well as specialty crop output. It is also home to one of the largest tree nurseries in Alberta, the Bonnyville Tree Nursery, with an area of around 52000 square feet dedicated to its operation. 

Its strategic location between the markets of St. Paul and Cold Lake drives significant commercial activity, especially due to the latter&#x27;s air force base. 

== Attractions ==
In celebration of Bonnyville&#x27;s centennial year (2007), the town constructed the Centennial Centre, an educational and recreational centre, as an extension of the R. J. Lalonde Arena and the Bonnyville &amp; District Agriplex. Its construction was somewhat controversial as its cost exceeded the original estimate and required a tax hike for both residents of the town and the municipal district.

== Sports ==
Bonnyville is home to the Bonnyville Pontiacs, a junior hockey team playing in the Alberta Junior Hockey League and also a senior hockey team, The Bonnyville Senior Pontiacs. The teams plays out of the R. J. Lalonde Arena, which is part of the Bonnyville &amp; District Centennial Centre.

== Government ==
Bonnyville Town Council is composed of a mayor and six councilors, all directly elected at large. The current mayor, as of the 2021 election, is Elisa Brosseau. The offices of the Municipal District of Bonnyville are located within the town.

Bonnyville is located within the Bonnyville-Cold Lake provincial electoral district. The current MLA is Scott Cyr, the United Conservative Party, elected in 2023. Previous MLAs include Genia Leskiw and Denis Ducharme.

Federally, Bonnyville falls within the electoral district of Lakeland, a newly re-created riding which is currently held by Shannon Stubbs of the Conservative Party, also first elected in 2015.

<text>A chamanto (Mapudungun &quot;chamall&quot;, woolen fabric) is a traditional decorative garment from central Chile, similar to a poncho and woven in silk thread and wool. Its entire contour is finished with ribbon edging. Traditionally, Chilean festive ponchos incorporate colors such as grey, brown, red, black, and white. The difference between a &quot;chamanto&quot; and other ponchos is their reversibility, as both sides — one light, one dark — are fully finished. Traditionally, the dark side of the poncho is used during the day, while its light side is mostly worn at night.

The &quot;chamantos&quot; gained world attention when they were worn by the 21 leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation during the 2004 summit&#x27;s official photo.

The making of a &quot;chamanto&quot; demands great diligence, because of the exquisiteness involved in the weaving of the silk and wool, plus the intricacy of the design sketched by crossing the threads.

The figures embellishing the &quot;chamantos&quot; include &quot;copihues&quot;, Chile&#x27;s national flower, barley and wheat ears, blackberries, bunches of grape, fuchsias, pansies and various birds representative of the national fauna.

<text>Alfred Osborn Pope Nicholson (August 31, 1808March 23, 1876), was a lawyer, newspaper editor, banker, and politician from Tennessee. A Democrat, he was twice a US Senator from that state.

==Biography==
Nicholson was born near Franklin, Tennessee, in Williamson County. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1827. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1831, opening a law practice in Columbia, Tennessee. He edited the &quot;Western Mercury&quot;, a paper then published in Columbia, from 1832 to 1835. He also served in the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1833 to 1839. In 1840 he was appointed, on an interim basis, to succeed to the US Senate seat vacated by the death of Senator Felix Grundy. He served in that office from December 25, 1840, to February 7, 1842. From 1843 to 1845 he served in the Tennessee State Senate, moving to Nashville during this period. He edited the &quot;Nashville Union&quot; from 1844 to 1846. From 1846 to 1847 he served as a director, and then as president, of the Bank of Tennessee. He owned slaves.

In 1853 President Franklin Pierce wished to appoint him to the Cabinet, but he declined to serve. He edited the &quot;Washington Union&quot; from 1853 to 1856 and subsequently served as public printer to the United States House of Representatives.

In 1859, Nicholson was elected to the US Senate by the Tennessee General Assembly. He served from March 4, 1859, to March 3, 1861, when he withdrew from participation in the Senate in anticipation of Tennessee declaring secession, which occurred the next month. Later in 1861, he formally resigned, as did all other Senators from Confederate states. However, fellow Tennessee senator Andrew Johnson, a Southern Unionist, was the only U.S. senator from a Confederate state in rebellion that did not immediately resign upon learning of his state’s secession.

After the Civil War, Nicholson served as chief justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1870 until his death.

He died on March 23, 1876, in Columbia, Tennessee. He was buried in Columbia&#x27;s Rose Hill Cemetery.

<text>The black oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani) is a conspicuous black bird found on the shoreline of western North America, ranging from the Aleutian Islands of Alaska to the coast of the Baja California peninsula.

It is the only representative of the oystercatcher family (Haematopodidae) over most of its range, overlapping slightly with the American oystercatcher (&quot;H. palliatus&quot;) on the coast of Baja California. Within its range it is most commonly referred to as the black oystercatcher, although this name is also used locally for the blackish oystercatcher and the African oystercatcher. Its scientific name was derived by John James Audubon from that of his friend John Bachman.

Although the species is not considered threatened, its global population is estimated between 8,900–11,000. It is a species of high conservation concern throughout its range (U.S., Canadian, Alaskan, and Northern &amp; Southern Pacific Shorebird Conservation Plans), a keystone indicator species along the north Pacific shoreline, a management indicator species in the Chugach National Forest, and a U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service focal species for priority conservation action.

== Description ==
The black oystercatcher is a large shorebird, with a black head, neck and breast and dark brown body, a long () bright red/orange bill and pink legs. It has a bright yellow iris and a red eye-ring. Its plumage varies slightly from north to south, being darker further north.

== Behavior ==
The bird is restricted in its range, never straying far from shores, in particular favoring rocky shorelines. It has been suggested that it is seen mostly on coastal stretches which have some quieter embayments, such as jetty protected areas. It forages in the intertidal zone, feeding on marine invertebrates, particularly molluscs such as mussels, limpets and chitons, but also on crabs, isopods and barnacles. It forages through the intertidal area, searching for food visually, often so close to the water&#x27;s edge it has to fly up to avoid crashing surf. It uses its strong bill to dislodge food and pry shells open. At high tides, it is normally inactive and can be seen resting and awaiting tidal reversal. 
Since black oystercatchers are territorial, especially during the nesting season, they can readily be detected by their loud vocalizations while flying, actively defending a foraging and nesting area in one territory. Some pairs have been recorded staying together for many years. Nests are small bowls or depressions close to the shore into which small pebbles and shell fragments are tossed with a sideward or backward flick of the bill.

Around two to three eggs are laid in this nest; they are very hard, and can even survive being submerged by a high tide or very high water levels. Incubation takes around 26–28 days. The chicks are capable of leaving the nest after one day, but stay in the territory for a long time after fledging (apx. 40 days). Fledged juveniles stay in the territory until the next breeding season. If the parents migrate, that year&#x27;s chicks may migrate with them, most commonly in the north of the range.

<text>Preston Rudolph York (August 17, 1913 – February 5, 1970) was an American professional baseball player, coach, scout, and manager. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher and a first baseman between and , most notably as a member of the Detroit Tigers.

A seven-time All-Star, York broke Babe Ruth&#x27;s record by hitting 18 home runs in a single month – a feat he accomplished as a rookie in 1937. In 1943, he led the American League with 34 home runs, 118 RBIs, a .527 slugging percentage, and 301 total bases. He was the starting first baseman and leading slugger for the Detroit team that won the 1945 World Series. Between 1937 and 1947, York led the major leagues in home runs (277), RBIs (1,143), and total bases (2,838).

He also played for the Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and the Philadelphia Athletics. After his playing career, he worked from 1951 to 1964 as a professional baseball manager, coach, and scout. He was the batting coach for the Boston Red Sox for four years from 1959 to 1962, including one game in July 1959 in which he acted as the team&#x27;s interim manager. He was posthumously inducted into the Michigan, Georgia, and Alabama Sports Halls of Fame.

==Early years==
York was born in 1913 in Ragland, Alabama, but the family moved to Georgia when York was a young boy. York&#x27;s father, Arthur, had only sporadic contact with the family. His mother, Beulah (Locklear) York, worked in Georgia&#x27;s textile mills and raised York and his four siblings. &quot;According to family history,&quot; his maternal great-grandmother Elizabeth Jane Barrett (Meadows) was a full-blooded Cherokee. York said in 1934 &quot;There is some Cherokee blood in our family, but it goes a long way back. I really never tried to trace it and don’t know much about it.&quot;

In the late 1920s, York&#x27;s mother moved the family to a mill town operated by the American Textile Company (ATCO) on the outskirts of Cartersville, Georgia. York joined his mother working at the mill and became the star player on the ATCO baseball team from 1930 to 1933.

York began playing professional baseball at age 19. During the 1933 season, he played three games with the Knoxville Smokies of the Southern Association, 12 games with the Shreveport Sports of the Dixie League, and 15 games with the Beaumont Exporters of the Texas League.

York continued to work his way through the minor leagues in 1934, playing for Beaumont and the Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League. He was briefly called up to the Detroit Tigers late in the season, appearing in three games in which he had one hit in six at bats.

In 1935, York played 148 games at first base for Beaumont, compiled a .301 batting average, led the league with 29 home runs and 114 RBIs and was selected as the Most Valuable Player in the Texas League. Despite his solid performance in the Texas League, there was no room for him in Detroit as Hank Greenberg played 152 complete games at first base and led the American League with 36 home runs and 168 RBIs.

Greenberg missed most of the 1936 season with a broken wrist, but the Tigers traded for Jack Burns rather than calling up York. While Burns hit .283 with four home runs in Detroit, York played first base for the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. He appeared in 157 games, hit .334 with 37 home runs, and was selected as the Most Valuable Player in the American Association.

===Detroit Tigers (1937–1945)===
York finally spent a full season with the Tigers in 1937. With Greenberg recovered from his injury, York had to look to other positions for playing time. He appeared in 104 games, beginning at third base for 41 games and then moving to catcher for 54 games. He compiled a .307 batting average and a .651 slugging percentage with 35 home runs and 101 RBIs in just 375 at bats. His ratio of 10.7 at bats per home run led the American League, and his .651 slugging percentage ranked third. He hit 18 home runs and collected 35 RBIs in the month of August, breaking the major league records previously held by Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Defensively, York was not as strong; his 12 passed balls led the league, and his nine errors in just 54 games at catcher ranked third in the league.

In 1938, York returned as the Tigers&#x27; catcher for 116 games and also played 14 games in left field. He hit .298, was selected for the All-Star team, and ranked among the American League leaders with 33 home runs (third), 128 RBIs (third), and a .579 slugging percentage (fifth). Defensively, he again led the league with 10 passed balls, but also ranked among the league&#x27;s leading catchers with 70 assists (second) and 10 double plays (third).

During the 1939 season, York shared catching duties with Birdie Tebbetts and started only 78 games – 67 at catcher and 11 at first base. Despite having only 376 at bats, he performed well at the plate with a .307 batting average, .544 slugging percentage, 20 home runs, and 68 RBIs.

Realizing that York was not best suited to the catcher position, and seeking to get his bat into the lineup on a full-time basis, the Tigers in 1940 shifted slugger Hank Greenberg from first base to left field, allowing York to return to his natural position at first base. The move proved successful as Greenberg and York each played 154 games and ranked highly among the league&#x27;s batters in several key batting statistics: first and second in RBIs (150 and 134); first and second in total bases (384 and 343); first and second in doubles (50 and 46); and first and third in home runs (41 and 33). The power duo of Greenberg and York helped propel the Tigers to the American League pennant with a 90–64 record. In the 1940 World Series, the Tigers lost to the Cincinnati Reds as York batted .231 (6-for-26) with one home run and two RBIs. (On August 24, in the first game of a doubleheader in Boston, York received an unwanted distinction when his future teammate, slugger Ted Williams, was called in to pitch in a 12-1 Tigers rout. Williams struck out York looking, making York the only man Ted ever whiffed in a big-league game.)

The Tigers lost Greenberg to military service for the 1941 season, leaving York as the team&#x27;s principal offensive weapon. Starting 155 games at first base for the second consecutive year, York received his second selection to the All-Star game. His batting average declined to .259, but he continued to hit for power with 27 home runs (including a three-home-run game on September 1st at Detroit) and 111 RBIs.

In 1942, York held out during spring training when the Tigers asked him to take a salary cut. In mid-March, he finally signed a contract providing a salary of approximately $9,000 with a $5,000 bonus if he collected 100 RBIs. He ended up hitting .260 with 21 home runs and 90 RBIs. In the 1942 All-Star Game, he hit a two-run home run in the first inning to propel the American League to a 3–1 victory over the National League.

York slumped badly at the plate for the first half of the 1943 season, drawing boos from the fans. Detroit sport writer H. G. Salsinger wrote at the time:&quot;York got away to a bad start and soon found himself in a severe slump. He went from bad to worse . . . His fielding became as bad as his batting and he appeared to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown . . . The crowds at Briggs Stadium were &#x27;riding&#x27; Rudy. Few players in history have ever been &#x27;ridden&#x27; harder. They booed him from the time his name was announced in the starting lineup until the last man was out. They booed him every time he came to bat, every time he went after a batted ball, every time he took a throw. The razzing didn&#x27;t start this year. The fans were ‘aboard’ York last season. He took an unmerciful booing all through 1942, and the booing increased with the start of the present season.&quot; 
York rebounded in the second half of the 1943 season, hitting 17 home runs in August, and ended up leading the American League with 34 home runs, 118 RBIs, a .527 slugging percentage, 67 extra-base hits, and 301 total bases. He was selected to his fifth All-Star team and finished third in the voting for the American League Most Valuable Player award.

In 1944, York was selected to the All-Star team for the sixth year, and York ranked among the American League leaders with 18 home runs (third), 98 RBIs (fifth), and 256 total bases (eighth). He also ranked among the league leaders in several defensive categories, both positive and negative, with 17 errors at first base (first), 163 double plays turned at first base (first), 1,453 putouts at all positions (second), and a 10.45 range factor per nine innings at first base.

In 1945, he started 155 games at first base for the Tigers team that won the American League pennant and defeated the Chicago Cubs in the 1945 World Series. During the 1945 season, he ranked among the league leaders with 23 double plays grounded into (first), 18 home runs (second), 85 strikeouts (second), 87 RBIs (fourth), 246 total bases (fourth), and 48 extra-base hits (fifth). Defensively, he led all position players with a career-high 1,464 putouts. He also led the league&#x27;s first basemen with 19 errors. In the 1945 World Series, he had five hits and three RBIs in 28 at bats.

On January 3, 1946, with the Tigers&#x27; planning to return Hank Greenberg to first base, the Tigers traded York to the Boston Red Sox for infielder Eddie Lake.

===Boston Red Sox (1946–47)===

In 1946, York started 154 games at first base for Boston and finished among the American League leaders with 1,326 putouts (first), 116 assists at first base (first), 154 double plays turned at first base (first), and 119 RBIs (third). He hit two grand slams in a game against the St. Louis Browns on July 27, 1947, as part of a 10 RBI day. The combination of York, Ted Williams, and Bobby Doerr helped lead Boston to the American League pennant. In the 1946 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, he hit a 10th-inning game-winning home run in Game 1 and another three-run, game-winning home run in the Game 3. Ultimately, St. Louis took the series four games to three.

In 1947, York started 48 games at first base for the Red Sox. On April 26, York escaped an early-morning fire in his Boston hotel suite caused when he fell asleep with a cigarette in his hand and liquor bottles strewn around. His batting average dipped to .212 with six home runs and 27 RBIs. By early June, York&#x27;s poor hitting and inconsistent effort prompted &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; to publish an article titled, &quot;What to Do About Big Rudy York?&quot; On June 14, 1947, the Red Sox traded York to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for Jake Jones.

===Chicago and Philadelphia (1947–48)===
After the trade from Boston, York started 102 games at first base for the White Sox and compiled a .243 batting average with 15 home runs and 64 RBIs. On August 23, 1947, a fire broke out in York&#x27;s Chicago hotel room, reportedly caused by a cigar that York left lit. York was unconditionally released by the White Sox in January 1948.

On February 12, 1948, two weeks after being released by the White Sox, York signed with the Philadelphia Athletics. He played in just 31 games, batting just .157. He appeared in his last major league game on September 20, 1948.

===Return to the minors (1949)===
After his major league baseball career ended, York continued to play when and where he could. It is believed that his playing career finally ended in 1952 when he batted .258 with two home runs for Benson-DeGraff in Minnesota&#x27;s Class AA amateur Western Minny league.

===Career statistics===

In 13 major league seasons, York compiled a .275 batting average with 1,621 hits in 5,891 at-bats, a .483 slugging percentage, 291 doubles, 52 triples, 792 walks, 277 home runs, and 1,149 RBIs in 1,603 games. In three World Series appearances, he hit .221 (17-for-77) with three home runs and 10 RBIs. He was selected for the All-Star Game seven times. York&#x27;s 239 home runs as a Tiger ranked second in franchise history until the 1960s and still ranks eighth all time. In each of the time he was in the top ten for walks (1938, 1940, 1941, 1943, 1944, 1946), he also ranked in the top five for strikeouts; in total, he also went in the top five for strikeouts three further times (1942, 1945, 1947) in strikeouts to make nine times.

With Cherokee ancestry and less-than-perfect fielding abilities, York prompted one sportswriter to declare: &quot;He is part Indian and part first baseman&quot;. However, his defensive weakness may have been exaggerated. While he did lead the American League in errors by a first baseman in 1941, 1944, and 1945, he also led the league&#x27;s first basemen in fielding percentage in 1947, in assists in 1942, 1943, and 1946, in putouts in 1946 and 1947, and in double plays turned in 1944 and 1946. And his range factor per game ranked among the top five in the league in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1944, 1945, 1946, and 1947.

==Manager, coach and scout==
York was a player-manager for the Youngstown/Oil City Athletics during the 1951 season. He hit 34 home runs and had 107 RBIs, but his record as manager was 19–64. He played for a semi-pro baseball team in 1952 and then obtained work outside baseball with the Georgia Forestry Commission in 1953. He returned to baseball as a scout for the New York Yankees in 1956. In June 1957, he was named by the Cleveland Indians as the manager of their North Platte team in the Nebraska State League.

In January 1958, York returned to the Boston Red Sox for a six-year association. He was first hired as a coach for the Memphis Chicks, the Bosox&#x27; Double-A affiliate. In 1959, he was promoted to the MLB Red Sox as the team&#x27;s batting coach. On July 3, 1959, he served as Boston&#x27;s acting manager for one game during the interim period between Pinky Higgins&#x27; firing and the hiring of Washington Senators coach Billy Jurges as Higgins&#x27; permanent successor. In York&#x27;s one game as manager, the Red Sox lost to the Baltimore Orioles, 6–1.

In 1963, with the hiring of Johnny Pesky as Boston&#x27;s manager, York lost his job as the team&#x27;s batting coach. However, Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey decided not to let York go and assigned him to the coaching staff of the Reading Red Sox for the 1963 season.

In 1964, York concluded his managing career as the manager of the Statesville Colts, a joint affiliate of the Red Sox and the Houston Colt 45s in the Western Carolinas League. Hired by former Tiger teammate Paul Richards, he then was listed as a scout for the Houston franchise, renamed the &quot;Astros&quot;, in 1965.

===Managerial record===
==Family, later years, and tributes==
York married Violet Dupree (1913–1988) in 1931. They had three children: Mary Jane (York) Pruitt (born 1932); the Rev. Joe Wilburn York (born 1936); and Blanche (York) Hines (born 1940).

After retiring from baseball, York worked as a self-employed house painter in Cartersville, Georgia. He developed lung cancer and underwent surgery and radiation therapy in November 1969. He died in February 1970 at Floyd County Hospital in Rome, Georgia, at age 56. The cause of death was reported to be bacterial pneumonia. York was buried at Sunset Memory Gardens in Cartersville.

In 1972, the former Atco Field in Cartersville was renamed Rudy York Field. At the dedication ceremony, Gov. Lester Maddox unveiled a five-foot high marble monument and a bronze plaque honoring York.

York was posthumously inducted in the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1972. His widow and three children all attended the induction ceremony in Detroit. York was also inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1977, and the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame in 1979.

<text>Stephen Friedman (born December 21, 1937) is an American economist. He is a former chairman of the U.S. President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Goldman Sachs. He was nominated on October 27, 2004, to replace Brent Scowcroft in the position. The Friedman Wrestling Center and the Friedman Strength and Conditioning Center at Cornell University are named after him.

==Early life and education==
Friedman was born in New York City, to a Jewish family. He received his BA from Cornell University in 1959 and his Juris Doctor degree from Columbia University Law School in 1962. At Cornell he was a member of the Quill and Dagger society and champion wrestler. At Columbia he was on the Law Review.

==Career==

In 1966, Friedman joined Goldman Sachs and became a partner in 1973. From 1987 until November 1990 he was the co-chief operating officer and either co-chairman or chairman between 1990 and 1994. Friedman re-joined the board of Goldman in April 2005, and stepped down from serving on the board on May 22, 2013.

In 1998, Friedman joined Stone Point Capital LLC. He also served as Senior Advisor at Crestview Partners, LP and a Special Limited Partner and Member of the Executive Advisory Board of Insight Partners.

From 1998 to 2002, he served as a senior principal of Marsh &amp; McLennan Capital Corp. In March 1999 President Clinton announced his intention to appoint Friedman and Crescencio S. Arcos to serve as Members of the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board.

From December 2002 to December 2004, Friedman was United States Assistant to President George W. Bush for Economic Policy as well as the director of the National Economic Council. On October 27, 2005 Friedman was asked to replace Brent Scowcroft as the Chairman of the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

==Chairman of New York Federal Reserve Bank==
Friedman was the Chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, a body which implements the Wall Street policies of the Federal Reserve, during a period of immense financial market upheaval, from January 2008 until May 7, 2009. When Goldman Sachs was converted to a bank holding company in September 2008 the bank then came under the regulatory authority of the New York Fed, which made Friedman’s position as a member of Goldman Sachs’ board a violation of Federal Reserve policy. At the time of the conversion Friedman requested a waiver from this violation, which was granted about 10 weeks later.

On May 7, 2009, Friedman resigned as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In his letter of resignation Friedman explains why: ‘Last Fall, after Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. became a bank holding company, I agreed to remain on the Board, pursuant to the waiver authority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, to provide continuity during a time of financial market instability. Today, although I have been in compliance with the rules, my public service motivated continuation on the Reserve Bank Board is being mis-characterized as improper. The Federal Reserve System has important work to do and does not need this distraction.’

Friedman was criticized for seemingly benefiting from his role as Chair of the New York Fed branch due to the federal government&#x27;s aid to Goldman Sachs in recent months. He had &quot;remain[ed] on the board of Goldman even as he was supposedly regulating [Goldman]; in order to rectify the problem, he applied for, and got, a conflict of interest waiver from the government. Friedman was also supposed to divest himself of his Goldman stock after Goldman became a bankholding company, but thanks to the waiver, he was allowed to go out and buy 52,000 &quot;additional&quot; shares in his old bank, leaving him $3 million richer,&quot; as one report put it. Friedman&#x27;s resignation announcement came within an hour of the government&#x27;s release of the 2009 stress tests for 19 U.S. financial institutions.

==Public service==

Friedman is involved in several public service activities, including Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Columbia University, Chairman Emeritus of the Executive Committee of the Brookings Institution, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He is also a benefactor of his alma mater Cornell University, particularly its wrestling program as the college&#x27;s wrestling building is known as the Friedman Center.

==Personal life==
Stephen Friedman is married to Barbara Benioff, chairwoman of the board of governors of Hebrew Union College. The couple live on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and have three children: two daughters, Susan and Caroline, and a son, David Benioff. Benioff, who goes by his mother&#x27;s maiden name, is a writer, screenwriter and adaptor of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. David is married to actress Amanda Peet.

<doc id="1229489" wikidata="Q3569866" url="?curid=1229489" title="Woody Johnson">
<text>Robert Wood Johnson IV (born April 12, 1947) is an American businessman who is co-owner of the New York Jets and was formerly the United States ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2017 to 2021. He is a great-grandson of Robert Wood Johnson I, and an heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson pharmaceutical fortune.

In 2000 he purchased the New York Jets football team for $635 million, the highest price for a New York professional sports team at that time, and is currently the Jets co-owner alongside his brother, Christopher Johnson. During his tenure as owner, Johnson was also part of the NFL search committee for a new commissioner.

A longtime Republican Party donor, Johnson was a supporter of Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign, and was appointed by Trump to the post of United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Events during his tenure included Britain&#x27;s exit from the EU and the relocation of the United States embassy in London. His brother Christopher took over Jets operations during his post.

Upon his return in 2021, Johnson resumed his role as chairman. In 2023, he pursued Aaron Rodgers, with the Jets finalizing a trade with the Green Bay Packers in April. In 2022, Johnson made a £2 billion bid for Chelsea F.C. but withdrew from the bidding process later that month.

==Early life and education==
Johnson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the son of Betty Johnson (née Wold; 1921–2020) and Robert Wood Johnson III, and the great-grandson of Robert Wood Johnson I, who founded the Johnson &amp; Johnson pharmaceutical company, along with his brothers James Wood Johnson and Edward Mead Johnson. Robert Wood Johnson IV grew up with four siblings: Keith Johnson, Billy Johnson, Elizabeth &quot;Libet&quot; Johnson, and Christopher Wold Johnson, in northern New Jersey, and attended the Millbrook School. He graduated from the University of Arizona. He worked for J&amp;J for a single summer.

==Career==

=== The Johnson Company, Inc ===
Johnson was the chairman and chief executive of The Johnson Company, Inc., a private investment firm.

In 2006, a Senate subcommittee produced a 370-page report that said that some prominent figures, including Johnson, purchased capital gain losses as a way to reduce their own income tax bills. Johnson settled with the IRS in 2006, agreeing to pay the owed taxes plus interest.

Johnson was the committee president of the Pre-Commissioning Unit for the ship &quot;USS New York&quot; (LPD-21).

=== New York Jets ===
In January 2000, Woody Johnson purchased the New York Jets for $635 million, making it the third-highest price ever paid for a professional sports team at the time, and the highest for a New York professional sports team. As of December of 2024, Forbes estimated the value of the team at $6.9 billion.

Following his acquisition of the Jets, Johnson moved the team to the newly constructed Meadowlands Stadium, sharing it as an equal partner with the New York Giants. The stadium, later named MetLife Stadium, officially opened on April 10, 2010.

In 2017, upon being appointed the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Johnson&#x27;s brother, Christopher Johnson, assumed the roles of CEO and acting owner of the Jets. Woody Johnson resumed his position as chairman in 2021 after returning to the United States, with Christopher Johnson becoming vice-chairman.

In January 2023, Johnson expressed the need for a strong quarterback to complement the Jets&#x27; robust defense, describing it as the &quot;missing piece&quot; in the team&#x27;s lineup. Subsequently, Johnson pursued four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers, stating to ESPN the importance of securing the best possible quarterback to lead the team. The Jets also hired Nathaniel Hackett as offensive coordinator, given his strong rapport with Rodgers. On April 24, 2023, it was reported that the Jets were finalizing a trade deal with the Green Bay Packers for Rodgers.

Since the start of the 2011 season however many in the media has criticized Johnson ownership of the Jets of being one of the worst in the league, with the Jets having the longest active playoff drought in the NFL, only one season above .500, numerous draft busts Zach Wilson, Sam Darnold although Darnold revied his career in recent years, Dee Milliner, and Calvin Pryor. As well as many in the media has criticized Johnson impatience/recklessness such as firing Robert Saleh only five games into the 2024 season after going 2-3, and Johnson letting go of Darnold after three seasons with Jets not giving Darnold enough time to develop in which Darnold saw a career revival with the Minnesota Vikings.

=== Other sports ventures ===
In March 2022, Johnson made a £2 billion bid to purchase London football club Chelsea F.C. from sanctioned billionaire Roman Abramovich. Johnson, who became a fan of the team during his ambassadorship in London, was considered to have an advantage over other bidders like Saudi Media Group due to his familiarity with London and experience in sports management. However, by March 25, it was reported that Johnson was no longer in contention to buy Chelsea F.C.

Johnson also helped the league select a successor to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue.

=== Net worth===
Johnson is a billionaire. As a fourth-generation descendant of one of the founders of the Johnson &amp; Johnson company, he is one of the heirs of the Johnson family fortune. In a 2017 financial disclosure form, Johnson listed his net worth at $4.2 billion, with most of his wealth tied to his ownership of the Jets and its stadium; he also reported owning at least 1.56 million J&amp;J shares (a stake then valued at more than $50 million). As of April 2024, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index placed his net worth at an estimated $9.92 billion.

==Political fundraising and endorsements==
By the year 2000, Johnson had given more than $1 million to various Republican candidates and committees. Between 1997 and 1998, he donated $130,000 to the Republican Party, along with donating $22,583 to George W. Bush&#x27;s 1998 gubernatorial re-election campaign of Texas. He was later a major New York fundraiser for Bush&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign.

In May 2008, he orchestrated a fundraiser in New York City that brought in $7 million in a single evening for John McCain&#x27;s presidential campaign, by far the largest amount collected up to that point by a campaign that had been struggling to raise money. Johnson also provided significant funding to 2008 Republican National Convention host committee; from a $10 million shortfall, Johnson contributed personally and solicited friends to assist in covering the convention deficit. In 2011, Johnson endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in the 2012 Republican presidential primaries. In September 2013, Johnson hosted a fundraiser for the Republican National Committee (RNC) at his home in New York City.

By 2016, Johnson had known Donald Trump for about 30 years, with the two men having social connections. Nevertheless, in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, Johnson initially endorsed Jeb Bush over Trump. In June 2015, Johnson was named the national finance chairman for Bush&#x27;s campaign. On several occasions, Trump singled out Johnson in a speech attacking Bush for accepting &quot;special interest&quot; money from donors. In May 2016, after Trump became the presumptive nominee, Johnson endorsed Trump for president. He met with Trump at Trump Tower and was named one of the RNC&#x27;s six finance vice chairmen, responsible for an effort to raise $1 billion on behalf of Trump&#x27;s campaign.

Johnson had by August 2019 donated $1.5 million to Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaigns and inaugural committee. In February 2020, Johnson gave $575,000 to a fundraising committee for Trump&#x27;s 2020 re-election campaign, and $355,000 to the RNC. In May 2020, he gave $1 million to America First Action, Inc., a pro-Trump super PAC.

On January 8, 2021, Johnson released a statement condemning the 2021 United States Capitol attack.

In 2023, Johnson gave at least $1 million to a super PAC backing Trump&#x27;s 2024 presidential campaign. He stood behind Trump at an election-night rally during the 2024 South Carolina primary.

==Ambassador to Britain (2017-2021)==

On January 19, 2017, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he planned to nominate Johnson to become United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. On June 22, 2017, Trump nominated Johnson for the position. Prior to becoming ambassador, he had no diplomatic experience.

Following a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Johnson was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on August 3, 2017, by voice vote. He was sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence on August 21, 2017, in the Oval Office. Johnson presented his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II on November 8, 2017.

In 2018, Johnson oversaw the relocation of the United States Embassy in London from Grosvenor Square, where it had been since 1938, to a new location in Nine Elms.

=== Brexit ===
During Johnson&#x27;s tenure, Britain withdrew from the EU. Johnson advocated for a bilateral US-UK trade deal post-Brexit, in line with President Trump&#x27;s hopes during that time. Johnson had a private dinner with Queen Elizabeth II at Winfield House on March 14, 2019, just two days after British Parliament rejected Theresa May&#x27;s Brexit plan.

In June 2019, he further stated that a post-Brexit deal between the US and the UK would cover &quot;all things that are traded&quot;, including the National Health Service and agricultural sector. In January 2020, Johnson stated that the US was never interested in the NHS, but reiterated American interest in a free-trade deal with the UK.

===Agriculture===
Johnson advocated for closer agricultural trade between the US and UK, and the deregulation of US food exports to Britain. In March 2019, Johnson wrote an article in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; saying that chlorinated chicken was a &quot;public safety no-brainer&quot; and that health fears over hormone-fed beef were &quot;myths&quot;. This came after he urged the UK to open up to the US agriculture market after the British exit from the European Union and ignore the &quot;smear campaign&quot; of those with &quot;their own protectionist agenda&quot;. Johnson was criticized by several British agriculture standard boards, such as the Red Tractor Assurance whose CEO, Jim Moseley stated the UK&#x27;s food standards were &quot;now under threat from ... the United States food lobby&quot;. Minette Batters, president of the UK National Farmers Union, agreed with Johnson&#x27;s claims that chlorine-rinsed chicken was safe for consumption, but stated that factors such as animal welfare and environmental protection also had to be considered. Batters commented that accepting US agricultural products produced in ways that would be illegal in the UK would &quot;put British producers out of business&quot;. The US National Farmers Union maintained that US methods of meat production were &quot;safe&quot;, describing criticism as &quot;fear-mongering&quot;.

=== Huawei ===
Johnson advised the UK government to ban Huawei from being used in the nation&#x27;s 5G networks after departing Prime Minister Theresa May approved the company in early 2019. Johnson said that Huawei could represent an economic and security risk, comparing it to &quot;letting a kleptomaniac move into your house.&quot; In 2020, after Britain decided to ban Huawei from its 5G mobile networks, Johnson welcomed the decision as a victory for human rights and fair trading practices.

===Allegations of &quot;inappropriate or insensitive comments&quot; to embassy staff ===
In July 2020, the State Department investigated allegations made by some current and former staff members that accused Johnson of making inappropriate comments about issues concerning race, personal appearance, and Black History Month.

Johnson denied the allegations, asserting that the claims were inconsistent with his values and record. The State Department and the U.S. Embassy in London stood by Johnson, highlighting his professional conduct and dedication to U.S.-UK relations. While an Inspector General report on the matter was pending, Johnson maintained that he had always followed ethical guidelines and that the accusations did not reflect his long-standing principles.

After the investigation, the inspector general issued a report in August 2020 that said that Johnson &quot;sometimes made inappropriate or insensitive comments on topics generally considered Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)-sensitive, such as religion, sex, or color&quot; that could &quot;create an offensive working environment&quot; and violate EEO (antidiscrimination) laws.

The inspector general&#x27;s office recommended that the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs and Office of Civil Rights (S/OCR) coordinate an investigation into Johnson&#x27;s conduct. S/OCR did so, and found that allegations against Johnson were unsubstantiated.

=== British Open at Trump Turnberry ===
In February 2018, Johnson as ambassador sought to have the lucrative British Open golf tournament moved to Trump&#x27;s Turnberry Golf Resort in Scotland, raising the idea with Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported, and the former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in London Lewis Lukens later confirmed, that Trump had asked Johnson to seek British government influence in obtaining the Open for Turnberry. At the time Lukens warned Johnson not to raise the question with the UK government, saying that an attempt to further the president&#x27;s personal financial interests in this way would be unethical and probably illegal. Johnson did so anyway, unsuccessfully.

In a statement, the British government said that Johnson &quot;made no request of Mr. Mundell regarding the British Open or any other sporting event&quot;; the statement did not say whether Johnson had raised the subject of Turnberry. Johnson did not deny the episode, saying only that he complied with &quot;the ethical rules and requirements of my office&quot;; Trump denied that he had ever spoken to Johnson &quot;about Turnberry.&quot; Lukens documented his concerns to State Department officials. Johnson forced out Lukens several months later, before the scheduled end of his tenure in London. The report that Johnson used his position as ambassador to promote the president&#x27;s personal business interests sparked an inquiry by the State Department inspector general&#x27;s office. In an interview in August 2020, Lukens said that the inspector general&#x27;s report had halted without a public report being issued, which he considered unusual.

==Personal life==

In 1977, Johnson married former fashion model Nancy Sale Johnson. They had three children before divorcing in 2001. In early 2010, daughter Casey Johnson died of diabetic ketoacidosis. He started a research foundation, the Alliance for Lupus Research, after his daughter Jaime was found to have lupus.

In 2009, Johnson married Suzanne Ircha, a former actress and equities managing director at Sandler O&#x27;Neill &amp; Partners. They have two children. Suzanne&#x27;s father emigrated from Ternopil, Ukraine after World War II, and her mother was a first-generation Ukrainian American. She grew up in a Ukrainian neighborhood in Greenwich Village.

Johnson has homes in Bedminster Township, New Jersey, and Palm Beach island in Florida, residing in the latter since 2020. He formerly had an apartment in Manhattan, but sold the unit (a two-floor duplex at 834 Fifth Avenue) in 2014 to billionaire Leonard Blavatnik for $80 million, setting a record for the costliest co-op ever sold in New York.

== Philanthropy ==
Johnson is known for philanthropy, especially donations to medical research. He raised money and lobbied to increase federal funding for lupus and diabetes. Johnson is also a trustee of the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Charitable Trust. He is the only member of the Johnson family to be invited to join the board of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

=== Diabetes research ===
Johnson was the chairman of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International. He and his wife became involved with diabetes charities after his daughter Casey was diagnosed with diabetes in 1988. In 1994, he co-wrote the book Managing Your Child&#x27;s Diabetes with his wife Nancy, and Casey. As of 2000, he had donated $12 million to the foundation. Johnson was a chairman on the Council on Foreign Relations, and successfully lobbied Congress to approve a five-year, $750 million package for funding diabetes research in 2002.

Casey died of diabetic ketoacidosis on January 4, 2010. On October 24, 2012, Johnson wrote an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal titled &quot;The Folly of Defunding Diabetes Research&quot;, which urged Congress to approve long-term funding for the Special Diabetes Program. He visited the University of Birmingham in 2018 to discuss the university&#x27;s diabetes research and research library.

=== Lupus research ===
Johnson is the founding chairman of the Alliance for Lupus Research (ALR). He founded the legacy organization, Alliance for Lupus Research, in 1999 after his daughter Jaime was diagnosed with lupus, and he realized that there was a lack of research in that area.

=== Ukraine ===
During the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Johnson and his wife Suzanne, who comes from a Ukrainian background, have organized aid efforts for Ukraine. Their family visited Poland, which is the primary destination for Ukrainian refugees displaced by the crisis. While in Poland, they made visits to community centers, shelters, and orphanages housing Ukrainian refugees. In an article for &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Johnson urged the United States and the United Kingdom to aid Ukraine.

In April 2022, the Jets pledged a $1 million donation to Ukraine, to be distributed to various organizations, including Plast Scouting USA and United24.

<doc id="1229491" wikidata="Q932516" url="?curid=1229491" title="Turnera diffusa">
<text>Turnera diffusa, known as damiana, is a shrub native to southern Texas in the United States, Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Passifloraceae.

Damiana is a relatively small, woody shrub that produces small, aromatic flowers. It blossoms in early to late summer, followed by fruits that taste similar to figs. The shrub is said to have a strong spice-like odor somewhat like chamomile, due to the aromatic compounds present in the plant.

==Uses==

Damiana is an ingredient in a traditional Mexican liqueur, which is sometimes used in lieu of triple sec in margaritas. Mexican folklore claims that it was used in the &quot;original&quot; margarita. The damiana margarita is popular in the Los Cabos region of Mexico.

Damiana was included in several 19th-century patent medicines, such as Pemberton&#x27;s French Wine Coca. The leaves were omitted from that product&#x27;s non-alcoholic counterpart, Coca-Cola. In folklore, the plant was believed to be an aphrodisiac, hence its sometimes used binomial synonym, &quot;Turnera aphrodisiaca&quot;.

Beyond its historical use in drinks, Damiana continues to be a valued herb for its ability to induce relaxation and improve emotional well-being. It is commonly found in modern herbal teas and smoking blends, where it is used for its calming, mild psychoactive effects.

==Phytochemistry==
Damiana contains damianin; tetraphyllin B; gonzalitosin I; arbutin; tricosan-2-one; acacetin; p-cymene; β-sitosterol; 1,8-cineole; apigenin; α-pinene; β-carotene; β-pinene; tannins; thymol; and hexacosanol. In total, 22 flavonoids, maltol glucoside, phenolics, seven cyanogenic glycosides, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, triterpenoids, the polyterpene ficaprenol-11, fatty acids, and caffeine have been found in the genus &quot;Turnera&quot;. As of 2006, damiana&#x27;s constituents have not been identified for their effects attributed to the whole herb. Damiana&#x27;s anxiolytic properties might be due to apigenin. The extract from damiana has been found to suppress aromatase activity, including the isolated compounds pinocembrin and acacetin.

==Ecology==
&quot;T. diffusa&quot; is a host plant for the Mexican fritillary (&quot;Euptoieta hegesia&quot;), a butterfly.

== Misidentification in commerce ==
Viable plant and seed material sold as &quot;T. diffusa&quot; from both private and commercial sources largely turns out to be misidentified &quot;Turnera ulmifolia&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;False Damiana&quot;), a closely related species. This widespread issue has been noted by the scientific community, and has created much confusion among both amateur and professional horticulturists alike. While &quot;T. ulmifolia&quot; are similar in appearance, its chemical constituents and ethnobotanical uses are distinctly different. Mature stems of &quot;T. diffusa&quot; are woody, with small, grayed green leaves 13 to 16 mm long, 4.5 to 5.5 mm wide, obtuse at the apex, and strongly aromatic when crushed. &quot;T. ulmifolia&quot; is differentiated by herbaceous stems, larger blue-green leaves that are strongly dentate with a pointed apex, and only weakly aromatic. One scientific study however, demonstrated this confusion being mostly associated with horticultural commerce, and does not extend appreciably to commercial herbal products, most of which exhibit constituents that can be definitively traced to &quot;T. diffusa&quot;.

<doc id="1229500" wikidata="Q772871" url="?curid=1229500" title="Francisco Urcuyo">
<text>Francisco Urcuyo Maliaños (30 July 1915 – 14 September 2001) was a Nicaraguan politician, who served as Vice President of Anastasio Somoza Debayle from 1967 to 1972, and President of Nicaragua very briefly after Somoza fled the country in 1979. 

Urcuyo was the president of the lower chamber of National Congress of Nicaragua 1972–1973 and 1978–1979. 

In July 1979, when Somoza resigned, Urcuyo was the president of the lower chamber of National Congress of Nicaragua. In 1979 he was handpicked by Somoza as successor to the presidency. Urcuyo became acting president of Nicaragua for a single day from 17 to 18 July 1979, following the resignation of Somoza on 17 July. Upon taking office, he announced his intention to serve out the remainder of Somoza&#x27;s term. This announcement provoked a strong reaction from the Sandinistas, other Latin American states, and the Carter Administration in the U.S.

Recognizing the untenability of his situation, Urcuyo fled to Guatemala on 18 July, effectively handing the country over to the Junta of National Reconstruction.

==Biography ==
===Life and political career===
Urcuyo was born in Rivas on 30 July 1915. He studied abroad in Mexico and graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico as a surgeon in 1944. Urcuyo&#x27;s political career began in 1954 and subsequently he served twice as vice minister of Health and president of the lower chamber of National Congress of Nicaragua. Later President René Schick appointed him as ambassador to Guatemala.

On 1 May 1967 Urcuyo was sworn in as Vice President of Nicaragua, serving with Vice President Alfonso Callejas Deshón in the second term of President Anastasio Somoza Debayle until May 1972, when the vice-presidency was abolished. Urcuyo was the president of the lower chamber of National Congress of Nicaragua 1972–1973 and 1978–1979. 

In July 1979, when Somoza resigned, Urcuyo was the president of the lower chamber of National Congress of Nicaragua. After Somoza&#x27;s resignation, Urcuyo was handpicked as Somoza&#x27;s successor to the presidency and served for 43 hours before fleeing from Managua to Guatemala, essentially leaving the capital to the Junta of National Reconstruction.

===Constitutional President (July 1979)===
When the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle fled the country on Tuesday, 17 July 1979, Urcuyo Maliaños was invested as a new constitutional president, with a mandate until 1 May 1981, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of 1974. During his brief presidency, he declared the legality of his mandate, and quickly began to engage in dialogue with the various political forces in the country. But he refused to hand over power to the Junta of National Reconstruction on the grounds that he was not prepared. Also, he began to replace the most important army positions with young related officers. That same day, the Andean Pact foreign ministers meeting in San José de Costa Rica publicly rejected the Urcuyo maneuver: &quot;We urge Urcuyo to abide by the obligation to transfer power, the only reason he occupies it. For his permanence in it will only contribute to the current contest acquiring new and more violent military dimensions. &quot;

On the morning of 18 July, the three members of the Junta, Sergio Ramírez, Alfonso Robelo, and Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, left San José, Costa Rica, towards León, where they met with Daniel Ortega and Moisés Hassan Morales. León was proclaimed as the new provisional capital, and the international community recognized them as the legitimate government of the Republic. Shortly after, Urcuyo fled on board a plane to Guatemala.

Urcuyo was married to María Luisa Muñoz and had four children.

===Published books===
During his exile, he published four books, in which he detailed his experiences of the fall of the Somocist regime and his experiences in exile during the 1980s:
*Alone, in which he related the last hours of the mandate of the Nationalist Liberal Party (PLN) of Somoza.
*Betrayed Allies.
*Carter and the Communists.
*Poetry and Memories, which he dedicated to his family. Among his works is the song to the mother that begins, &quot;Being stuck to my being as a conscience, love attached to my love as a sacrament&quot;.

==Death==

Urcuyo died on 14 September 2001, aged 86, in Managua.

<doc id="1229501" wikidata="Q3438646" url="?curid=1229501" title="Roger Altman">
<text>Roger Charles Altman (born April 2, 1946) is an American investment banker, the founder and senior chairman of Evercore, and a former Democratic politician. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Carter administration from January 1977 until January 1981 and as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury in the Clinton administration from January 1993 until he resigned in August 1994, amid the Whitewater controversy.

==Early life and education==
Altman was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and was raised in Boston as a Catholic. His father, a food broker, died when he was 10 years old, and his mother, a librarian, raised Altman and his brother as a single mother. He attended the Roxbury Latin School.

He attended Georgetown University, where he met future President Bill Clinton, and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1967. In 1969 he earned an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, but took time off in 1968 to work in Indiana organizing volunteers for Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign.

==Career==

===Early career===
After graduating from business school in 1969, Altman began working at Lehman Brothers, where he grew close to chairman Peter G. Peterson. In 1974, he was made general partner at the age of 28—the youngest in Lehman&#x27;s history. He left Lehman in 1977 to serve as Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance in the U.S. Treasury from 1977 to 1981 under President Jimmy Carter, for whom he had fundraised when Carter was Governor of Georgia, and campaigned for in 1976, as well as working on his transition team. As Assistant Secretary, Altman played a &quot;role in negotiating the Federal Government&#x27;s $1.5 billion bailout of the Chrysler Corporation.&quot;

In 1981, he returned to Lehman Brothers, where he became the co-head of investment banking and served on the board of the company and the management committee. During the 1980s, he was a lecturer and adjunct professor at the Yale University School of Management. In 1987, Altman joined the Blackstone Group as vice-chairman and head of its mergers and acquisitions advisory business. During the Reagan-Bush years, he fundraised for Democratic politicians such as Vice President Walter F. Mondale, Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis, and Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton. He also advised two New York City Mayors, Ed Koch and David N. Dinkins.

===Clinton administration===
When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, he urged U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to take Altman on as his Deputy Secretary. He was confirmed in January 1993. Once on the job, Altman was viewed as &quot;the favorite to succeed the 73-year-old Treasury Secretary,&quot; and he played a large role in some of the Clinton administration&#x27;s biggest legislative victories, such as the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the &quot;approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.&quot; He was associated with the moderate economic policies of the Clinton administration&quot; and had a reputation as a &quot;deficit hawk.&quot;

However, he resigned in 1994, after it was revealed that Altman had notified the Clinton White House of the criminal referrals made by the Resolution Trust Corporation. After nearly 15 hours of testimony in February 1993 before the House and Senate Banking Committees, he submitted his resignation in August 1994, saying that he hoped his resignation would &quot;help to diminish the controversy.&quot; He was succeeded by Frank N. Newman, who was the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance at the time.

===Return to private sector===
In 1995, instead of returning to Blackstone, he co-founded Evercore, an &quot;independent investment banking advisory firm&quot; in New York City, and currently serves as its chairman. By 2014, Evercore was &quot;a major player,&quot; and its investment management arm had more than $14 billion in assets under management, with its investment banking advisory arm boasting $1.5 trillion in &quot;announced transactions.&quot; Evercore advised General Motors through its bankruptcy, and was paid $46 million by GM pre-bankruptcy. However, when it asked for a $17.9 million &quot;success fee,&quot; a U.S. bankruptcy trustee called the fees &quot;staggering,&quot; &quot;inordinately large,&quot; and &quot;clearly [exceeding] the bounds of reasonableness&quot; given that &quot;Evercore had no success at finding a purchaser or funder for the Debtors.&quot;

Politically, Altman continued to stay in the loop. He advised two presidential candidates—John Kerry in 2004, and Hillary Clinton in 2008. In 2010, President Barack Obama interviewed him as a potential candidate to replace Larry Summers as his National Economic Council director, a job that ultimately went to Gene Sperling.

==Other activities==
Altman has sat on the Board of Trustees of New York-Presbyterian Hospital since 2006, Vice Chairman of the Board of the American Museum of Natural History, and Chairman of New Visions for Public Schools. Additionally, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, a Director of Conservation International, and an Advisory Council member for The Hamilton Project, a Brookings Institution economic policy initiative.

Altman is listed as a member of the Steering Committee of The Bilderberg Group, a controversial group of influential business and government leaders who meet annually behind closed doors to foster dialogue between Europe and North America. He participated in all their conferences between 2008 and 2016.

==Personal life==
His first marriage to Barbara ended in divorce, and he remarried at age 35 to journalist Jurate Kazickas in 1981. The Rev. James N. English of Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Church in Washington, D.C. performed the marriage ceremony at the San Luis Rey Chapel at Cat Cay in the Bahamas. They have three children. In 1992, he collapsed while jogging in Central Park due to an irregular heartbeat. His hobbies include jogging, skiing, fly-fishing, and tennis.

<doc id="1229502" wikidata="Q942489" url="?curid=1229502" title="Island scrub jay">
<text>The island scrub jay (Aphelocoma insularis), also known as the island jay or Santa Cruz jay, is a bird in the genus, &quot;Aphelocoma&quot;, which is endemic to Santa Cruz Island off the coast of Southern California. Of the over 500 breeding bird species in the continental U.S. and Canada, it is the only insular endemic landbird species.

==Description==
The island scrub jay is closely related to the California scrub jay (the coastal population found on the adjacent mainland), but differs in being larger, more brightly colored, and having a markedly stouter bill. They will bury, or cache, the acorns in the fall and may eat them months later. They also eat insects, spiders, snakes, lizards, mice and other birds&#x27; eggs and nestlings.

==Taxonomy==
The island scrub jay was first described by American ornithologist Henry Wetherbee Henshaw in 1886 and an archaeological specimen at site SCRI-192 dating from the 1780s-1812 on Santa Cruz Island is the earliest evidence of the bird in the historic period. This bird is a member of the crow family, and is one of a group of closely related North American species named as scrub jays. These were formerly treated as a single species, the scrub jay (as &quot;Aphelocoma coerulesens&quot;), with five subspecies, but are now considered four species: the Florida scrub jay (&quot;A. coerulescens&quot;), the island scrub jay, the California scrub jay (&quot;A. californica&quot;), and Woodhouse&#x27;s scrub jay (&quot;A. woodhouseii&quot;). DNA studies indicate that the island and coastal forms have long been isolated from their relatives inland. The relationships within the genus have been studied in several papers (e.g.)

Island scrub jays seem to be incapable of crossing to the mainland. However they were once present on three of California&#x27;s northern Channel Islands, San Miguel Island, Santa Rosa Island, and Santa Cruz Island where they persist today. Reliable historical observer records for island scrub jays in addition to Santa Cruz Island include only a single 1892 account on neighboring Santa Rosa Island, only about 10 km (6 mi) away. The historic observation on Santa Rosa Island is supported by a Pleistocene archaeological record of a single island scrub jay femur from a Late Pleistocene-Holocene site (SRI-V-3) found by Paul Collins of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. There are also two Late Holocene archaeological remains found in San Miguel Island cave sites. There are no definite occurrences of a scrub-jay on any other of the Channel Islands, or on the Coronado Islands, only 13 km (8 mi) from the mainland. 

Early studies suggested that the ancestor of the present population was storm-borne or carried on driftwood to Santa Cruz, or that the colonization occurred during a period of glaciation 70,000 to 10,000 years ago, when sea levels were much lower and the channel between the coast and the islands was correspondingly narrower. More recent DNA studies show that, although other island endemics such as the island fox and the Santa Cruz mouse may have diverged from their mainland relatives around 10,000 years ago, the scrub jays separated in a period of glaciation around 151,000 years ago. The most recent analysis indicates that the island scrub jay has been evolving in isolation for approximately one million years, i.e. over multiple glacial cycles. Up to about 11,000 years ago, the four northern Channel Islands were one large island, so island scrub jays must have been present on all four islands initially, but became extinct on Santa Rosa, San Miguel and Anacapa after they were separated by rising sea levels.

==Distribution and habitat==
The island scrub jay is found today only on Santa Cruz Island, the largest of California&#x27;s Channel Islands with an area of 250 km2 (96 mi2). The island is a nature reserve, the eastern 24% being administered by National Park Service as the part of the Channel Islands National Park and the rest of the island by the Nature Conservancy. Fossil remains for island scrub jays have been found on Santa Rosa and San Miguel Islands.

Island scrub jays occur in oak chaparral and bishop pine (&quot;Pinus muricata&quot;) woodland on Santa Cruz Island. Island scrub jays in pine habitat have longer, shallower bills than individuals in oak habitat; variation in bill shape is heritable, and individuals mate nonrandomly with respect to bill morphology.

==Breeding==
Females lay 3 to 5 eggs. Incubation lasts approximately 20 days. These jays are generally monogamous and, unlike some other jays, are not cooperative breeders. Both sexes build a nest to above the ground. Further details in.

==Etymology==
The genus name, &quot;Aphelocoma&quot;, comes from the Latinized Ancient Greek &quot;apheles-&quot; (from ἀφελής-) &quot;simple&quot; + Latin &quot;coma&quot; (from Greek &quot;kome&quot; κόμη) &quot;hair&quot;, in reference to the lack of striped or banded feathers in this genus, compared to other jays. The species name, &quot;insularis&quot;, comes from the Latin for &quot;from an island&quot;.

==Conservation status==
The island scrub jay is classed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because its small range makes it potentially vulnerable to a catastrophic incident such as disease or a large fire that destroys their habitat. Population size in 2008 and 2009 was estimated to be 1700 – 2300, making this one of the rarest songbird species in the United States. The entire range of island scrub jays is currently protected in Channel Islands National Park and the species is not at imminent risk of extinction. However, the establishment of West Nile virus (WNV) in southern California in 2003 may pose a threat if it crosses to Santa Cruz Island from the mainland. Corvids are especially vulnerable to WNV. In addition, the increased occurrence of wildfires in southern California may portend a catastrophic fire there. Shrub cover has increased since the removal of sheep (1980–91) and feral pigs (2005–07) from Santa Cruz Island, which may increase the fire risk. Overgrazing by non-native ungulates may have caused extirpation of island scrub jays on Santa Rosa Island. Re-establishing a second population of island scrub jays on Santa Rosa Island and San Miguel Island may accelerate the restoration of native plant and tree species because of the scatter-hoarding seed caching behavior of &quot;Aphelocoma&quot; species.

==Human interaction and uses==
The Chumash people who were the original inhabitants of the northern Channel Islands may have eaten the local scrub jay, or used its feathers for decoration, since they are known to have made feather bands including jay feathers on the Californian mainland. Human activities may have contributed to the presumed extinction of the island scrub-jay from the smaller islands.

<text>Elias Daoud Khoury (, ) is an Arab-Israeli Jerusalem-based lawyer. He specializes in real property law. Elias made appeals several times to the Supreme Court of Israel, and has had Palestinian politicians among his clients in Israeli courts. Elias gained fame in the 1970s when he led a legal battle against the Israeli settlers of Sebastia and Elon Moreh.

== Early life and career ==
Elias Khoury was born in the Galilee. His father lost the family land to Israel in the 1948 war, took citizenship in Israel, and believed he could work patiently through Israeli law to get his land back. Elias studied law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and lived in the Beit Hanina and Shuafat neighborhoods of Jerusalem. 

Khoury has a practice in Jerusalem, formerly in its Eastern part and now in the West, specializing in real property law. He has represented clients at all Israeli court levels, including the Supreme Court of Israel, as well as in planning commissions.

== Terror victims in the family and activism ==
Both Khoury&#x27;s father and son were killed in Palestinian terror attacks. Khoury&#x27;s father, Daoud Khoury, was killed when a booby-trapped refrigerator exploded in Zion Square. Elias&#x27; son, George Khoury, was killed by gunfire on 19 March 2004, while jogging in the neighborhood of French Hill in Jerusalem. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the military branch of the Fatah movement, claimed responsibility. After it became clear that the victim was an Arab it apologized, and offered to declare him a martyr for the Palestinian cause. &quot;This is a barbaric act that will not change my world view, which includes deep faith in Palestinian rights,&quot; said Khoury.

In the framework of his public activities, he has expressed concerns about the impacts of the lack of Arab participation in the urban politics of Jerusalem, while expressing an understanding of the rationale. In 2008, he expressed concerns with a planned real estate deal between his own Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem and the State of Israel.

On 6 March 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Khoury had paid to have Amos Oz&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of Love and Darkness&quot; translated into Arabic and distributed in Beirut and other Arab capitals. Of his decision to pay for the translation and publication of the book, Khoury said: &quot;This book tells the history of the rebirth of the Jewish people. We can learn from it how a people like the Jewish people emerged from the tragedy of the Holocaust and were able to reorganize themselves and build their country and become an independent people. If we can&#x27;t learn from that, we will not be able to do anything for our independence.&quot;

<doc id="1229508" wikidata="Q2711499" url="?curid=1229508" title="Alan Blinder">
<text>Alan Stuart Blinder (, born October 14, 1945) is an American economics professor at Princeton University and is listed among the most influential economists in the world. He is a leading macroeconomist, politically liberal, and a champion of Keynesian economics and policies.

Blinder served on President Bill Clinton&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers from January 1993 to June 1994 and as the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve from June 1994 to January 1996.

His academic work has focused particularly on monetary policy and central banking, and on the &quot;offshoring&quot; of jobs. His writing has been published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, as well as a monthly column in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Regarding the 2008 near-meltdown of major financial institutions, Blinder drew ten lessons for fellow economists, including “Excessive complexity is not just anti-competitive, it&#x27;s dangerous” and “Illiquidity closely resembles insolvency.” 

==Early life==
Blinder was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Syosset High School in Syosset, New York. Blinder attended Princeton University as an undergraduate student and graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. in economics in 1967. He completed a 130-page long senior thesis, titled &quot;The Theory of Corporate Choice&quot;. He received an MSc in economics from the London School of Economics in 1968 and received a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1971. He was advised by Robert Solow.

==Professional life==

===Academic career===
Blinder is the Gordon S. Rentschler Memorial Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton where he has been since 1971; from 1988 to 1990, he chaired the economics department. Also in 1990, he founded Princeton&#x27;s Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies. And he has served as vice-chair of The Observatory Group.

Since 1978, Blinder has been a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. He is a past president of the Eastern Economic Association and Vice President of the American Economic Association and was named a Distinguished Fellow of the latter in 2011. He is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1991), a member of the American Philosophical Society since 1996, and a member of the board of the Council on Foreign Relations (since 2008). Blinder&#x27;s textbook &quot;Economics: Principles and Policy&quot;, co-written with William Baumol, was first published in 1979 and, in 2012 was printed in its twelfth edition.

In 2009 Blinder was inducted into the American Academy of Political and Social Science, &quot;for his distinguished scholarship on fiscal policy, monetary policy and the distribution of income, and for consistently bringing that knowledge to bear on the public arena.&quot; He is a strong proponent of free trade. Blinder has been critical of the public discussion of the US national debt, describing it as generally ranging from &quot;ludicrous to horrific&quot;.

===Political career===
Blinder is listed among the most influential economists in the world according to IDEAS/RePEc.

In 1975, Blinder served as the Deputy Assistant Director of the Congressional Budget Office.

In the 1990s, he served on President Bill Clinton&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers from January 1993 to June 1994, and as the 15th Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve from June 27, 1994, to January 31, 1996 (more specifically as the Vice Chairman of Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).

As Vice Chairman, Blinder cautioned against raising interest rates too quickly to slow inflation because of the lags in earlier rises feeding through into the economy. He also warned against ignoring the short term costs in terms of unemployment that inflation-fighting could cause.

Many have argued that Blinder&#x27;s stint at the Fed was cut short because of his tendency to challenge chairman Alan Greenspan. By challenging assumptions, Blinder supposedly disrupted &quot;the whole pipeline of Greenspan-arriving-at-decisions.&quot;

He was an adviser to Al Gore and John Kerry during their respective presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004.

===Private sector===
Blinder was a co-founder and a vice-chair of the Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC.

After his service as the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Blinder, along with several former regulators, founded a company that offers a number of services that provide a means for depositors (including governmental entities, nonprofits, businesses, as well as individuals such as retirees) to access millions in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage at a single institution instead of multiple ones. This provides banks that are members the ability to offer coverage above the FDIC per account/per bank limit by letting those banks place funds into CDs or deposit accounts issued by other network banks. This occurs in increments below the standard FDIC insurance maximum ($250,000) so that both principal and interest are eligible for FDIC insurance. The company acts as a sort of clearinghouse, matching deposits from one institution with another. Through its services it allows access to higher levels of FDIC insurance although limits apply.

===&quot;Cash for Clunkers&quot;===

Blinder was an early advocate of a &quot;Cash for Clunkers&quot; program, in which the government buys some of the oldest, most-polluting vehicles and them. In July 2008, he wrote an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; advocating such a program, which was implemented by the Obama administration during the summer of 2009. Blinder asserted it could stimulate the economy, benefit the environment, and reduce income inequality. The program was praised by President Obama for &quot;exceeding expectations&quot;, but criticized for economic and environmental reasons.

===Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, and slow recovery===
The Great Recession started in December 2007 and bottomed-out in June 2009, at which point the U.S. economy began a slow recovery. Blinder points out that payroll employment didn’t regain its previous level until almost five additional years.

Blinder argues for 10 lessons for fellow economists, including —
&lt;br&gt;
4)“Self-regulation is oxymoronic.”
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
5) “Fraud and near-fraud can rise to attain macroeconomic significance.”
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
6) “Excessive complexity is not just anti-competitive, it&#x27;s dangerous.”
::&quot;“ . . no one knows what these securities are really worth. .”&quot;

Regarding the teaching of college-level economics, Blinder writes, “If you are not teaching your students that ‘Keynesianism’ is neither conservative nor liberal, you should be.”

Economic models with one interest rate — &quot;“the”&quot; interest rate — are no longer good enough. He writes, “After all, in the 2000s we saw several dramatic instances of risk spreads first narrowing dangerously, then skyrocketing once fear took over from greed, and then narrowing again as calm returned.”

For a beginning class in economics, he recommends including QE, or Quantitative Easing, as practiced by the Fed, the fact that investment bubbles can and do occur, and that “leverage is a double-edged sword.”

Regarding other concepts such as “Too Big To Fail,” Blinder recommends including them in advanced courses but not in introductory classes. He thinks the early class(es) should include material which economists largely agree on, the “received wisdom” as it were, although he sees how other teachers might come to different conclusions.

=== Criticism of consumption-focused economics ===

In a 2019 article entitled “The Free-Trade Paradox: The Bad Politics of a Good Idea,” Blinder states that the main focus of the economics profession has been using price signals to produce goods and services as cheaply as possible. Jobs are viewed as secondary, and often as a distinct negative which people put up with only to get the money for their own consumption.

But then he asks, “What if people care as much (or more) about their role as producers — about their jobs — as they do about the goods and services they consume? That would mean economists have been barking up the wrong tree for more than two centuries.”

He still thinks there&#x27;s an excellent case to be made for free trade, just not the case which economists typically make.

<text>Miguel Algarín Jr. (11 September 1941 – 30 November 2020) was a Puerto Rican poet, writer, co-founder of the Nuyorican Poets Café, and a Rutgers University professor of English.

==Early years== 
Algarín was born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, and was educated and raised in a culturally-minded household. The love for all things involving culture always prevailed in his family. His family and he migrated to the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City in 1950. While there he received both his primary and secondary education. Algarín went on to study English at the University of Wisconsin (B.A., 1963) and Pennsylvania State University (M.A., 1965). He then received his PhD in comparative literature at Rutgers University. Teaching English at Brooklyn College and New York University, he developed a love and understanding of the works of Shakespeare. Shakespeare&#x27;s antique tales were the force which motivated Algarín to strive to one day have a place of his own where he could tell the story of where he lives. Eventually, Algarín became a professor of Shakespeare, creative writing, and United States ethnic literature at Rutgers University.

In 1973, Algarín was using the living room of his apartment in Manhattan as a gathering place for poets and artists. By 1975, there were so many poets and artists gathering and reciting their works in the apartment, that Algarín decided to look for a more comfortable location.

==Nuyorican Poets Café==
After some time of hosting poets in his apartment, Algarín, Miguel Piñero, Pedro Pietri, and other poets rented a location on East 6th street and named it the Nuyorican Poets Café. In 1980, Algarín purchased a building on East 3rd street to expand the café. The Café is now a non-profit organization that offers programs which include poetry and prose readings, theatrical and musical performances, and visual arts exhibits. It is one of the key cultural institutions of the Nuyorican Movement. The Nuyorican Poets Cafe popularized slam poetry.

The theater has won over 30 &quot;AUDELCO Awards&quot; and was honored with an Obie grant for excellence in theater. Of the screenplays read in the theater, 40 have been turned into films. The Latin jam session which is celebrated at the Café has been a weekly &quot;Critics Choice&quot; at the New York Press for six consecutive years. The Café also has a radio broadcast on WBAI, where Algarín started the broadcast with his signature &quot;We&#x27;re live from the Nuyorican Poets Café&quot;.

Algarín played an important role in the spread of Nuyorican literature by compiling, with Miguel Piñero, its first anthology &quot;Nuyorican Poetry: An Anthology of Puerto Rican Words and Feelings&quot;. He also founded a publishing house called the Nuyorican Press, which only published one book, his own &quot;Mongo Affair&quot;. He also helped launch Arte Public Press, which became a leading publishing house for Nuyorican works.

Principally known as a poet, Algarín&#x27;s books include &quot;Mongo Affair&quot;, &quot;On Call&quot; (1980), &quot;Body Bee Calling from the 21st Century&quot; (1982), &quot;Time&#x27;s Now/Ya es tiempo&quot; (1985), and &quot;Love Is Hard Work: Memorias de Loisaida/Poems&quot; (1997, Lower East Side Memories/Poems). He also published anthologies of works that were performed at the Nuyorican Poets Café, including &quot;Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets Café&quot; (1994) which he co-edited with Bob Holman. He was the editor of &quot;Action: The Nuyorican Café Theatre Festival&quot; and co-editor of &quot;Aloud&quot;. Among his award-winning poetry books are &quot;Time&#x27;s Now/Ya Es Tiempo&quot; and &quot;Love is Hard Work&quot;.

==Honors==
Algarín held the status of Professor Emeritus for his more than 30 years of service to Rutgers University. He has received three American Book Awards and the Larry Leon Hamlin Producer&#x27;s Award at the 2001 National Black Festival. In the movie &quot;Piñero&quot;, about the life of Miguel Piñero, directed by Leon Ichaso and starring Benjamin Bratt, Algarín is portrayed by the actor Giancarlo Esposito. Algarín received three American Book Awards and became the first Latino to win the Before Columbus Lifetime Achievement American Book Award in 2009.

==Later years==
Algarín retired as professor from Rutgers University, but continued as the executive producer of the Nuyorican Poets Café&#x27;s theater and was working on a piece of literature titled &quot;Dirty Beauty&quot;. In 2001, he was portrayed by actor Giancarlo Esposito in the Miguel Piñero biopic &quot;Piñero&quot;.

==Death==
Algarín died from sepsis at a hospital in Manhattan on 30 November 2020, at age 79.

<doc id="1229520" wikidata="Q4545909" url="?curid=1229520" title="10.2 surround sound">
<text>10.2 is the surround sound format developed by THX creator Tomlinson Holman of TMH Labs and the University of Southern California (schools of Cinematic Arts and Engineering). Developed along with Chris Kyriakakis of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, &quot;10.2&quot; refers to the format&#x27;s slogan: &quot;Twice as good as 5.1&quot;. However, there actually may be 14 discrete channels if the left and right point surround channels are included. He states that 5.1, a name which he himself came up with in 1987 was chosen as it was &quot;the minimum number of channels necessary to give a sense of spaciousness&quot;. Holman and others state that higher sampling rates, which is a recent trend in digital recording, does not have a significant perceivable effect and that the next frontier in sound engineering is to increase the number of discrete channels to meet human spatial sound perception. , several decoding, UHD, or virtual expansion processors have approached numbers as great or greater than 10.2.

== Channel configurations ==
10.2 surround sound would add four more channels to the front listening area and only one surround channel. This is because human spatial perception of sound is much more precise in the front than in the back. In addition it adds depth to the sound field with two of the front channels being height channels, located above the listening area at 45 degrees relative to the listener. Lack of vertical information has long been considered one of the largest obstacles to realistic sound reproduction. Existing systems such as Dolby Pro Logic IIz simulate this with &quot;matrixed&quot; height channels, which are derived from ambient sounds from the left and right channels. 

The &quot;.2&quot; in 10.2 refers to the fact that an additional Low Frequency Effects channel is added, not just a second subwoofer, to enhance the sense of envelopment. All bass from the left channels are directed to a left LFE channel while right channel bass is directed to the right LFE channel.

===10.2===
The 12 channels of 10.2:
*Seven front channels: Left Wide, Left Height, Left, Center, Right, Right Height, Right Wide
*Three surround channels: Left Surround, Back Surround, Right Surround
*Two LFE channels: LFE Left and LFE Right

10.2 may also augment the LS (left surround) and RS (right surround) channels by two point surround channels that can better manipulate sound—allowing the mixer to shift sounds in a distinct 360° circle around the movie watcher. This would actually make it 12.2

===12.2===
The only addition with 12.2 from 10.2 are the &quot;point surround&quot; or &quot;diffuse surround&quot; channels. These would be placed at the same angles as the standard surround speakers at +/-120 degrees, but would be diffuse radiators using dipole speakers. They would emit sound to reflect off the walls before arriving at the listening area.
The 14 discrete channels are:

*Five front speakers: Left Wide, Left, Center, Right and Right Wide
*Five surround channels: Left Surround Diffuse, Left Surround Direct, Back Surround, Right Surround Diffuse and Right Surround Direct
*Two LFE channels: LFE Left, LFE Right
*Two Height channels: Left Height, Right Height

The &quot;.2&quot; of the 10.2 refers to the addition of a second subwoofer. The system is bass managed such that all the speakers on the left side use the left sub and all the speakers on the right use the right sub. The Center and Back Surround speakers are split among the two subs. The two subs also serve as two discrete LFE (Low Frequency Effects) channels.

==Installations==
A 10.2 surround sound system was demonstrated at Audyssey in Los Angeles and at Bjorn&#x27;s Audio Video in San Antonio, Texas. 

New York University claims to have two 10.2 surround sound systems set up in their new $6.5 million music technology complex at Steinhardt School. One in a recording studio and one in a screening room. Products are already being sold to accommodate 10.2 surround systems such as in-wall speaker jacks.

Currently, there is only a standard for 5.1 surround setups. 6.1 and 7.1 have no real standard, and add channels to the rear instead of the front, which can only be conceived as a marketing tool as sonically the front needs more channels. Audyssey has stated that one fear of marketing 10.2 systems will be that ironically quality might be decreased instead of increased. This is because marketers will push to keep prices relatively the same and to do that with four additional speakers and two subwoofers will almost certainly cost quality.

== Media ==
There is currently only one film available which uses this format, a 30-minute short called &quot;Seven Swans&quot;. The other 10.2 mixes were created by Holman and others at the demonstrations. 

There are some receivers that claim to be &quot;10.2 channels&quot; such as the Pioneer Elite SC-09TX but just have multiple 6, 7, or 8 channel decoders.

<doc id="1229523" wikidata="Q165887" url="?curid=1229523" title="Emmaus">
<text>Emmaus ( ; ; ; ) is a town mentioned in the Gospel of Luke of the New Testament. Luke reports that Jesus appeared, after his death and resurrection, before two of his disciples while they were walking on the road to Emmaus.

Although its geographical identification is not certain, several locations have been suggested throughout history, chiefly Imwas and Al-Qubeiba, both in the West Bank. It is known only that it was connected by a road to Jerusalem; the distance given by Luke varies in different manuscripts and the figure given has been made even more ambiguous by interpretations.

==Names and location==
The place-name Emmaus is relatively common in classical sources about the Levant and is usually derived through Greek and Latin from the Semitic word for &quot;warm spring&quot;, the Hebrew form of which is &quot;hamma&quot; or &quot;hammat&quot; (חמת). In the ancient and present-day Middle East, many sites are named Hama Hamath and variations thereof.

The name for Emmaus was hellenized during the 2nd century BC and appears in Jewish and Greek texts in many variations: Ammaus, Ammaum, Emmaus, Emmaum, Maus, Amus, etc.: , 

Emmaus may derive from the Hebrew &quot;ḥammat&quot; () meaning &quot;hot spring&quot;, although this remains uncertain. It is generally referred to in Hebrew sources as &quot;Ḥamtah&quot; or &quot;Ḥamtān&quot;. A spring of Emmaus (), or alternatively a &#x27;spring of salvation&#x27; () is attested in Greek sources. Unlike other Biblical or Mishnaic sites with the name &quot;Ḥamah&quot; and where the traditional Hebrew spelling has been preserved in classical texts throughout the ages, Emmaus differs insofar that the traditional Hebrew spelling for this place in most classical sources is or . During the late Second Temple period, Emmaus was renamed Nicopolis (&quot;City of Victory&quot;), a name remained in use as late as the 6th-century Madaba Map. Emmaus is mentioned by this name in Midrash Zutta for Song of Songs 6,8 and Midrash Rabba for Lamentations 1,45, and in the Midrash Rabba on Ecclesiastes (7:15). According to Sozomen (fl.400450), it was renamed by the Romans &quot;in consequence of the conquest of Jerusalem and the victory over the Jews.&quot;

==Emmaus in the New Testament==

Emmaus is mentioned in the Gospel of Luke as the village where Jesus appeared to his disciples after his crucifixion and resurrection. indicates that Jesus appears after his resurrection to two disciples who are walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus, which is described as being 60 stadia (10.4 to 12 km depending on what definition of &quot;stadion&quot; is used) from Jerusalem. One of the disciples is named Cleopas (verse 18), while his companion remains unnamed:

That very day two of them were going to a village (one hundred and) sixty stadia away from Jerusalem called Emmaus, and they were speaking about all the things that had occurred. And it happened that while they were speaking and debating, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him … As they approached the village to which they were going, he gave the impression that he was going on further. But they urged him, &quot;Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is declining.&quot; So he went in to stay with them. And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him.
According to the gospel, the story takes place in the evening of the day of Jesus&#x27;s resurrection. The two disciples hear that the tomb of Jesus was found empty earlier that day. They are discussing the events of the past few days when a stranger asks them what they are discussing. &quot;Their eyes were kept from recognizing him.&quot; He rebukes them for their unbelief and explains prophecies about the Messiah to them. On reaching Emmaus, they ask the stranger to join them for the evening meal.

When he breaks the bread, &quot;their eyes [are] opened&quot; and they recognize him as the resurrected Christ. Jesus immediately vanishes. Cleopas and his friend then hasten back to Jerusalem to carry the news to the other disciples.

A similar event is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark (), although the disciples&#x27; destination is not stated. This passage is believed by some to be a late addition, derived from the Gospel of Luke.

The incident is not mentioned in the Gospels of Matthew or John.

==Possible locations==
Emmaus is the Greek variant of the Hebrew word and place-name for hot springs, &quot;hammat&quot;, and is therefore not unique to one location, which makes the identification of the New Testament site more difficult.

Several places in Judea and Galilee are called Emmaus in the Bible, the works of Josephus Flavius, and other sources from the relevant period. The one most often mentioned is a town of some importance situated in the Valley of Ajalon (today, Ayyalon), later called Emmaus Nicopolis.

==Historical identification==

Many sites have been suggested for the biblical Emmaus, among them Emmaus Nicopolis (c. 160 stadia from Jerusalem), Kiryat Anavim (66 stadia from Jerusalem on the carriage road to Jaffa), Coloniya (c. 36 stadia on the carriage road to Jaffa), el-Kubeibeh (63 stadia, on the Roman road to Lydda), Artas (60 stadia from Jerusalem) and Khurbet al-Khamasa (86 stadia on the Roman road to Eleutheropolis). The oldest identification that is currently known is Emmaus Nicopolis. The identification is complicated by the fact that New Testament manuscripts list at least three different distances between Jerusalem and Emmaus in Luke 24:13-14.

===Emmaus Nicopolis/Imwas===

The first modern site identification of Emmaus was by the explorer Edward Robinson, who equated it with the Palestinian Arab village of Imwas (), near the Latrun Abbey. Before its destruction during the Six-Day War in 1967, the village of Imwas was located at the end of the Ayalon Valley, on the border of the hill country of Judah, at 153 stadia (18.6 miles) from Jerusalem via the Kiryat Yearim Ridge Route, 161 stadia (19.6 miles) via the Beth-Horon Ridge Route and lower by elevation.

Eusebius was probably the first to mention Nicopolis as biblical Emmaus in his Onomasticon. Jerome, who translated Eusebius&#x27; book, implied in his letter 108 that there was a church in Nicopolis built in the house of Cleopas where Jesus broke bread on that late journey. From the 4th century on, the site was commonly identified as the biblical Emmaus.

Emmaus Nicopolis appears on Roman geographical maps. The Peutinger Table situates it about west of Jerusalem, while the Ptolemy map shows it at a distance of from the city. The Emmaus in the Gospel of Luke seems to lie some from Jerusalem, though a textual minor variant, conserved in Codex Sinaiticus, gives the distance between the New Testament Emmaus and Jerusalem as 160 stadia. The geographical position of Emmaus is described in the Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Sheviit 9.2:
From Bet Horon to the Sea is one domain. Yet is it one domain without regions? Rabbi Johanan said, &quot;Still there is Mountain, Lowland, and Valley. From Bet Horon to Emmaus () it is Mountain, from Emmaus to Lydda Lowland, from Lydda to the Sea Valley. Then there should be four stated? They are adjacent.&quot;
Archaeologically, many remains have been excavated at the site of the former Palestinian village, now located inside Canada Park, which support historical and traditional claims. Five structures were found and dated, including a Christian basilica from the 6th century and a 12th-century Crusader church. Emmaus Nicopolis is a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.

There are several sources giving information about this town&#x27;s ancient history, among them the First Book of Maccabees, the works of Josephus, and chronicles from the Late Roman, Byzantine and Early Muslim periods. According to 1 Maccabees 3:55-4:22, around 166 BC Judas Maccabeus fought against the Seleucids in the region of this particular Emmaus, and was victorious at the Battle of Emmaus; later, this town was fortified by Bacchides, a Seleucid general (1 Macc 9:50). When Rome took over the land it became the capital of a district or toparchy, and was burnt by order of Varus after the death of Herod in 4 BC. During the First Jewish Revolt, before the siege of Jerusalem, Vespasian&#x27;s 5th legion was deployed there while the 10th Legion was in Jericho. The town was renamed Emmaus Nicopolis in AD 221 by Emperor Elagabalus, who conferred it the title of &quot;polis&quot; (&quot;city&quot;) following the request of a delegation from Emmaus. The Plague of Emmaus in AD 639, mentioned in Muslim sources, is claimed to have caused up to 25,000 deaths in the town.

Nicopolis (, &quot;Nikópolis&quot;) was the name of Emmaus (; , &quot;Ammaoûs&quot;; , &quot;Imwas&quot;) under the Roman Empire until the conquest of Palestine by the Rashidun Caliphate in 639. The Church Fathers unanimously considered this city to be the Emmaus of the New Testament where Jesus was said to have appeared after his death and resurrection; it is sometimes distinguished from other Emmauses of Palestine and other Nicopolises of the Roman Empire by the combined name or . The site of the ancient city, now lies between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem in Israel. The archaeological site has been cared for by a resident French Catholic community since 1993 but are formally organized as a part of Canada Park under the general supervision of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.

====Hellenistic, Hasmonean period====
Due to its strategic position, Emmaus played an important administrative, military and economic role in history. The first mention of Emmaus occurs in the First Book of Maccabees, chapters 3–4, in the context of Judas Maccabeus and his revolt against the Greek Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century. The first major battle of the revolt, the Battle of Emmaus, is traditionally believed to have occurred in this area, with the Seleucids establishing a fortified camp here from which to control the countryside. During the Hasmonean period, Emmaus became a regional administrative centre (toparchy) in the Ayalon Valley.

According to one theory, Emmaus of the Hasmonean and early Roman periods was located at Horvat &#x27;Eqed.

====Roman period====
Josephus Flavius mentions Emmaus in his writings several times. He speaks about the destruction of Emmaus by the Romans in the year 4. The importance of the city was recognized by the Emperor Vespasian, who established a fortified camp there in 68 to house the fifth (&quot;Macedonian&quot;) legion, populating it with 800 veterans, though this may refer to Qalunya rather than Emmaus Nicopolis. Archaeological works indicate that the town was cosmopolitan, with a mixed Jewish, pagan and Samaritan population, the presence of the last group being attested by the remains of a Samaritan synagogue. In 130 or 131, the city was destroyed by an earthquake. In 132, the ruins of Emmaus fortress were briefly reconstructed by Judean rebels under Simon Bar Kokhba and used as a hideout during the revolt.

The city of Nicopolis was founded on the ruins of Emmaus in early 3rd century, after Julius Africanus, who said he had interviewed descendants of Jesus&#x27; relatives, headed an embassy to Rome and had an interview with the Roman emperor Elagabalus on behalf of Emmaus, then a small Palestinian village (). St. Eusebius writes &quot;Emmaus, whence was Cleopas who is mentioned by the Evangelist Luke. Today it is Nicopolis, a famous city of Palestine.&quot; In 222, a basilica was erected there, which was rebuilt first by the Byzantines and later modified by the Crusaders.

====Byzantine period====
During the Byzantine period Nicopolis became a large city and a bishopric. A substantial church complex was erected on the spot where tradition maintained the apparition of the risen Christ had occurred, a site which then became a place of pilgrimage, and whose ruins are still extant.

====Early Muslim period====
At the time of the Islamic conquest of Palestine, the main encampment of the Arab army was established in Emmaus, when a plague (&quot;ța&#x27;ūn&quot;) struck, carrying off many of Companions of the Prophet. This first encounter of the Arab armies with the chronic plagues of Syria was later referred to as the &#x27;plague of &#x27;Amawās&#x27;, a and the event marked the decline of Emmaus Nicopolis. A well on the site still bears an inscription reading &quot;the well of the plague&quot; (&quot;bi&#x27;r aț-ța&#x27;ūn&quot;).

====Crusader period====
During the Crusader period, the Christian presence resumed at Emmaus, and the Byzantine church was restored. However, the memory of the apparition of the risen Jesus at Emmaus also started to be celebrated in three other places in the Holy Land: Motza (c. west of Jerusalem), Qubeibe (c. northwest of Jerusalem), and Abu Ghosh (c. west of Jerusalem).

====Ottoman period====
The Arab village of Imwas was identified once again as the biblical Emmaus and the Roman-Byzantine Nicopolis by scholars in the 19th century, including Edward Robinson(1838–1852), M.-V. Guérin (1868), Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau (1874), and J.-B. Guillemot (1880–1887). Significantly, a local mystic named Saint Mariam of Jesus Crucified, a nun of the Carmelite monastery of Bethlehem, had a revelation while in ecstatic prayer in 1878 in which Jesus appeared to indicate Amwas was the Gospel Emmaus. &quot;She came to the top of a knoll where, amid grass and thorns, there were some freestones leveled. Transported and moved, she turned toward her sisters [in religion], and said to them in a loud voice: &#x27;This is truly the place where our Lord ate with His disciples.&#x27;&quot; On the basis of this revelation, the holy place of Emmaus was acquired by the Carmelite order from the Muslims in 1878, excavations were carried out, and the flow of pilgrims to Emmaus resumed.

====British Mandate====
In 1930, the Carmelite Order built a monastery, the &quot;House of Peace&quot;, on the tract of land purchased in 1878. In November 1947, the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine attributed the area to the Arab State. Prior to the outbreak of hostilities in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, ʻImwâs had a population of 1,100 Arabs.

====Jordan====
Israelis and Jordanians fought during the battle of Latrun for the control of this strategic zone which blockaded the road to Jerusalem. As part of the outcome of the war the Palestinian village of Imwas, which lay on the site of Emmaus Nicopolis, fell within the West Bank territory under Jordanian rule.

====Israel====
In 1967, after the Six-Day War the residents of Imwas Israeli forces expelled the population and the village was razed by bulldozers, leaving the Byzantine-crusader church, called in Arabic, &quot;al-Kenisah,&quot; intact in their cemetery. The Catholic congregation, the Community of the Beatitudes, renovated the site in 1967–1970 and opened the French Center for the Study of the Prehistory of the Land of Israel next to it where they were allowed to settle in 1993.

Subsequently, Canada Park was created in 1973, financed by the Jewish National Fund (JNF) of Canada, and included the plantation of a forest on the rubble of Imwas. The site became a favourite picnic ground for Israelis and the Latrun salient an area of Israeli commemoration of its War of Independence.

====Archaeology====
Archaeological excavations in Imwas started in the late 19th century and continue nowadays: Clermont-Ganneau (1874), J.-B. Guillemot (1883–1887), Dominican Fathers L.-H. Vincent &amp; F.-M. Abel (1924–1930), Y. Hirschfeld (1975), M. Gichon (1978), Mikko Louhivuori, M. Piccirillo, V. Michel, K.-H. Fleckenstein (since 1994). During excavations in Canada Park ( Ayalon forest) ruins of Emmaus fortifications from the Hasmonean era were discovered, along with a Roman bathhouse from the 3rd century CE, Jewish burial caves from the 1st century CE, Roman-Byzantine hydraulic installations, oil presses and tombs. Other findings were coins, oil lamps, vessels, jewellery. The eastern (rear) three-apsidal wall of the Byzantine church was cleared, with an external baptistery and polychrome mosaics, as well as walls of the Crusader church which were built against the central Byzantine apse (12th century). In the area of Emmaus, several Hebrew, Samaritan, Greek and Latin inscriptions carved on stones have been found.

====Identification with the Gospel site====
Most manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke which came down to us indicate the distance of 60 stadia (c. 11 km) between Jerusalem and Emmaus. However, there are several manuscripts which state the distance as 160 stadia (31 km). These include the uncial manuscripts א (Codex Sinaiticus), Θ, Ν, Κ, Π, 079 and cursive (minuscule) manuscripts 158, 175, 223, 237, 420, as well as ancient lectionaries and translations into Latin (some manuscripts of the Vetus Latina, high-quality manuscripts of the Vulgate), in Aramaic, Georgian and Armenian languages. The version of 60 stadia has been adopted for the printed editions of the Gospel of Luke since the 16th century. The main argument against the version of 160 stadia claims that it is impossible to walk such a distance in one day. In keeping with the principle of Lectio difficilior, lectio verior, the most difficult version is presumed to be genuine, since ancient copyists of the Bible were inclined to change the text in order to facilitate understanding, but not vice versa. It is possible to walk from Jerusalem to Emmaus and back in one day.

The ancient Jewish sources (1 Maccabees, Josephus Flavius, Talmud and Midrash) mention only one village called Emmaus in the area of Jerusalem: Emmaus of Ajalon Valley. For example, in the &quot;Jewish War&quot; (4, 8, 1) Josephus Flavius mentions that Vespasian placed the 5th Macedonian Legion in Emmaus. This has been confirmed by archaeologists who have discovered inscribed tombstones of the Legion&#x27;s soldiers in the area of Emmaus. (The village of Motza, located 30 stadia (c. ) away from Jerusalem, is mentioned in medieval Greek manuscripts of the &quot;Jewish war&quot; of Josephus Flavius (7,6,6) under the name of Ammaus, apparently as a result of copyists&#x27; mistake).

The ancient Christian tradition of the Church fathers, as well as pilgrims to the Holy Land during the Roman-Byzantine period, unanimously recognized Nicopolis as the Emmaus in the Gospel of Luke (Origen (presumably), Eusebius of Caesarea, St. Jerome, Hesychius of Jerusalem, Theophanes the Confessor, Sozomen, Theodosius, etc.).

===Al-Qubeiba/Castellum Emmaus/Chubebe/Qubaibat===
Another possibility is the village of al-Qubeiba, west of Nabi Samwil on the Beit Horon road northwest of Jerusalem. The town, meaning &quot;little domes&quot; in Arabic, is located at about 65 stadia from Jerusalem. A Roman fort subsequently named Castellum Emmaus (from the Latin root castra, meaning encampment) was discovered at the site in 1099 by the Crusaders. However, there is no source from the Roman, Byzantine or Early Muslim periods naming it as &quot;Emmaus&quot; for the time of Jesus. Whether Josephus (who puts Emmaus at a distance of thirty &quot;stadia&quot; from Jerusalem) was referring to this place is now uncertain. However, the Gospel of Luke speaks of 60 stadia (Luke 24:13), a distance very close to the actual 65 stadia to Qubeibeh.

In the 12th century, the Crusaders of the Kingdom of Jerusalem called the site &quot;Small Mahomeria&quot;, in order to distinguish it from the &quot;Large Mahomeria&quot; near Ramallah. Sounding similar to &quot;Mahommed&quot;, the term was used in medieval times to describe a place inhabited or used for prayer by Muslims. It was referred to as Qubaibat for the first time at the end of that same century by the writer Abu Shama, who writes in his &quot;Book of the Two Gardens&quot; about a Muslim prince falling into the hands of the Crusaders at this spot. The Franciscans built a church here in 1902, on the ruins of a Crusader basilica.

During the Second World War, British authorities held Franciscans of Italian and German nationality at Emmaus-Qubeibeh. While there,
Bellarmino Bagatti conducted excavations from 1940 to 1944 which revealed artifacts from the Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Crusader periods. Inspired by Bagatti&#x27;s work, Virgilio Canio Corbo also undertook some experimental explorations.

===Abu-Ghosh/Kiryat Anavim===

Abu Ghosh is located in the middle of the Kiryat Yearim Ridge Route between Nicopolis and Jerusalem, nine miles (83 stadia) from the capital. A former Minorite convent with a Gothic church was turned into a stable. Robinson dated it to the Crusader period and declared it &quot;more perfectly preserved than any other ancient church in Palestine.&quot; Excavations carried out in 1944 supported the identification with Fontenoid, a site the Crusaders held for a while to be Emmaus before accepting Nicopolis as the &quot;real&quot; Emmaus.

===Emmaus/Colonia/Motza/Ammassa/Ammaous/Khirbet Mizza===
Colonia, between Abu Ghosh and Jerusalem on the Kiryat Yearim Ridge Route, is another possibility. At a distance of c. 8 km from Jerusalem, it was referred to as Mozah in the Old Testament (). Listed among the Benjamite cities of , it was referred to in the Talmud as a place where people would come to cut young willow branches as a part of the celebration of Sukkot (Mishnah, Sukkah 4.5: 178). Motza was identified as the Emmaus of Luke in 1881 by William F. Birch (1840–1916) of the Palestine Exploration Fund, and again in 1893 by Paulo Savi. One mile to the north of modern Motza is a ruin called Khirbet Beit Mizza, which was identified by some scholars as the biblical Mozah, until recent excavations placed Mozah at Khirbet Mizza (without &quot;Beit&quot;), as the ruins of Qalunya/Colonia are called in Arabic.

Excavations in 2001-2003 headed by Professor Carsten Peter Thiede were cut short by his sudden death in 2004. Thiede was a strong proponent of Motza as the real Emmaus. He offered that the Latin &quot;Amassa&quot; and the Greek &quot;Ammaous&quot; are derived from the biblical Hebrew name Motza: Motza – ha-Motza (&quot;ha&quot; is the Hebrew equivalent of the definite article &quot;the&quot;) – ha-Mosa – Amosa – Amaous – Emmaus. His excavation summaries were removed from the website of the Basel college he was teaching at, but a book and at least one article he published on the topic are available. He contended that neither Nicopolis, Abu Ghosh, or Al-Qubeiba can be considered because the first was located too far from Jerusalem, while the two others were not called Emmaus at the time of Jesus.

Josephus Flavius writes in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; about a city called Emmaus in the context of the Maccabean Revolt, which corresponds well with the large city later called Emmaus Nicopolis, located at over 170 Roman stadia from Jerusalem, while in &quot;The Jewish War&quot; he brings up another Emmaus, just 30 Roman stadia from Jerusalem, where Vespasian settled 800 Roman legionnaires after the First Jewish Revolt. The ancient Latin manuscripts use &quot;Amassa&quot;, while the medieval Greek manuscripts use &quot;Ammaous&quot;. The newly created Roman &quot;colonia&quot; soon made the old name disappear: even the Jewish works of the 3rd-5th centuries, the Mishnah, the Babylonian and the Jerusalem Talmud, talk about &quot;Qeloniya&quot;, an Aramaic distortion of &quot;colonia&quot;. This name survived into modern times in Arabic as &quot;Qalunya&quot;. This was indeed always a village, not a city like Emmaus Nicopolis, and thus fits the description by Luke (κωμη &quot;village&quot;) much better than the latter. The difference in distance to Jerusalem between Luke&#x27;s and Josephus&#x27; Emmaus, 60 vs. 30 stadia, is still much smaller than the one to Nicopolis, which lays fully 176 stadia down the Roman road from Jerusalem. Thiede recalculated the actual distance between Jerusalem&#x27;s western city gate at the time, and his excavation site at Motza which unearthed the Jewish village that predated the Roman veterans colony, and came up with a figure of 46 stadia. That would put it squarely in the middle between Luke&#x27;s and Josephus&#x27; stated distances, which Thiede considers a good approximation for the time. Thiede&#x27;s excavation produced Jewish artifacts of the time preceding the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, giving substance to his claim to have found Luke&#x27;s Emmaus, which had necessarily to be settled by Jews. With no other Emmaus in the vicinity of Jerusalem, Motza was thus the only credible candidate.

=== Horvat &#x27;Eqed ===

Horvat &#x27;Eqed, situated on a hilltop 2 km east of Emmaus Nicopolis, is a recent candidate for the site of ancient Emmaus. This archaeological site features significant fortifications dating back to the second century BC, potentially attributed to the Seleucid general Bacchides and reinforced during the Bar Kokhba revolt, in the early 2nd century AD. Discoveries at the site include ritual baths, a hiding system used during the revolt, as well as various artifacts like Bar Kokhba coinage and weaponry. 

According to one theory, Emmaus was originally located at Horvat &#x27;Eqed during the Hellenistic and early Roman periods, and was later abandoned in the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt. The name Emmaus later transferred to the site of Emmaus Nicopolis, where the city was located in the Roman and Byzantine periods.

==Possible symbolic identification==
One of the oldest extant versions of the Gospel of Luke, preserved in the Codex Bezae, reads &quot;Oulammaus&quot; instead of Emmaus. In Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament scriptures, Oulammaus was the place where Jacob was visited by God in his dream, while sleeping on a rock. However, Oulammaus was not a real place name but a translation mistake. The original name in Hebrew was &quot;Luz&quot;. This mistake was later corrected, but was still there at the time when the Gospel was written around AD 100. Thus, a theory has been put forward, that the story in the Gospel was merely symbolic, drawing a parallel between Jacob being visited by God and the disciples being visited by Jesus.

==Contemporary use==
Emmaus, Pennsylvania, a township in the Lehigh Valley region of the United States, draws its name from the Biblical references to Emmaus.

<text>The Jerome Park Reservoir is a reservoir located in Jerome Park, a neighborhood in the North Bronx, New York City. The reservoir is surrounded by DeWitt Clinton High School, the Bronx High School of Science, Lehman College, and Walton High School.
==History==
The reservoir was built in 1906 to serve the New Croton aqueduct as part of the New York City water supply system. It is named for Jerome Park Racetrack, a part of the former Old Bathgate Estate (owned by Winston Churchill&#x27;s maternal grandfather Leonard Walter Jerome 1817–1891, for whom the racetrack was originally named) which opened in 1866 and which was the site of the inaugural Belmont Stakes in 1867. The racetrack was condemned, bought by New York City and closed in 1889 to make way for the reservoir.

In 1996, residents organized under the leadership of Jerome Park Conservancy to stop the city from converting the site to a water treatment plant. It was thought that the noise, chemicals, and unsightly construction would decrease the quality of life for area residents, and have a negative impact on the learning environment at nearby schools.

The reservoir was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The related High Pumping Station had been listed in 1983.

The treatment plant was built in another part of the North Bronx underneath Van Cortlandt Park. In connection with this work, the Croton system was taken offline and the reservoir emptied in December 2008. It was refilled and returned to service in early 2014. In November 2015, the DEP experimentally opened the perimeter to the public for tours.

<text>Ashton Baldwin Carter (September 24, 1954 – October 24, 2022) was an American government official and academic who served as the 25th United States secretary of defense from February 2015 to January 2017. He later served as director of the Belfer Center for Science &amp; International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School.

Carter began his career as a physicist. After a brief experience as an analyst for the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, he switched careers to public policy. He joined the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1984 and became chair of the International &amp; Global Affairs faculty. Carter served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy during President Clinton&#x27;s first term, from 1993 to 1996, responsible for policy regarding the former Soviet states, strategic affairs, and nuclear weapons.

During President Obama&#x27;s first term, he served first as Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and then Deputy Secretary of Defense until December 2013. In February 2015, he replaced Chuck Hagel as Secretary of Defense and served until the end of the Obama administration. During his tenure, he ended the ban of transgender officers in the military. In 2016, Carter opened all military occupations and positions to women without exception. This marked the first time in U.S. history that women with the appropriate qualifications would be allowed to serve in military roles such as infantry, armor, reconnaissance, and special operations units.

For his service to national security, Carter had on five occasions been awarded the DOD Distinguished Public Service Medal. He had also received the CJCS Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award, and the Defense Intelligence Medal for his contributions to intelligence. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2025 by President Joe Biden. Carter was author or co-author of eleven books and more than 100 articles on physics, technology, national security, and management.

==Early life==
Ashton Baldwin Carter was born on September 24, 1954, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father is William Stanley Carter Jr., a World War II veteran, United States Navy neurologist and psychiatrist, and department chairman at Abington Memorial Hospital for 30 years. His mother is Anne Baldwin Carter, an English teacher.

He has three siblings, including children&#x27;s book author Cynthia DeFelice. As a child he was nicknamed Ash and Stoobie.

Carter was raised in Abington, Pennsylvania, on Wheatsheaf Lane. At age eleven, working at his first job at a Philadelphia car wash, he was fired for &quot;wise-mouthing the owner.&quot;

=== Education ===
Carter was educated at Highland Elementary School (class of 1966) and at Abington Senior High School (class of 1972) in Abington. In high school, he was a wrestler, lacrosse player, cross-country runner, and president of the Honor Society. He was inducted into Abington Senior High School&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1989.

Carter attended the University of Edinburgh in Scotland in 1975. In 1976, Carter completed his Bachelor of Arts (BA) in his double-major of physics and medieval history at Yale College, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, Phi Beta Kappa. His senior thesis, &quot;Quarks, Charm and the Psi Particle&quot;, was published in &quot;Yale Scientific&quot; in 1975. He was also an experimental research associate at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in 1975 (where he worked on quark research) and at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1976.

Carter then became a Rhodes Scholar and studied at the University of Oxford. He received his Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) in theoretical physics on &quot;Hard processes in perturbative QCD&quot; in 1979 and was supervised by Christopher Llewellyn Smith. He was a member of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Carter was subsequently a postdoctoral fellow research associate in theoretical physics at Rockefeller University from 1979 to 1980, studying time-reversal invariance and dynamical symmetry breaking. He coauthored two papers on CP violations in B meson decays with A. I. Sanda, which were used as one of theoretical basis to build B factories.

Carter was then a research fellow at the MIT Center for International Studies from 1982 to 1984, during which time he wrote a public report assessing that the Reagan-proposed &quot;Star Wars&quot; initiative could not protect the U.S. from a Soviet nuclear attack.

==Academic career==
Carter taught at Harvard University, as an assistant professor from 1984 to 1986, associate professor from 1986 to 1988, professor and associate director of the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government from 1988 to 1990, and director of the center from 1990 to 1993. At the Kennedy School, he became chair of the International and Global Affairs faculty and Ford Foundation Professor of Science and International Affairs. He concurrently was co-director of the Preventive Defense Project of Harvard and Stanford Universities.

==Early Department of Defense career==

From 1993 to 1996, Carter served as assistant secretary of defense for international security policy during President Bill Clinton&#x27;s first term. He was responsible for strategic affairs, including dealing with the threat of weapons of mass destruction elsewhere in the world, nuclear weapons policy (including overseeing the U.S. nuclear arsenal and missile defenses), the 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, the Agreed Framework signed in 1994 which froze North Korea&#x27;s plutonium-producing nuclear reactor program, the 1995 extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the negotiation of the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and the multibillion-dollar Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program and Project Sapphire that removed all nuclear weapons from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. Carter directed military planning during the 1994 crisis over North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons program. In addition, he was responsible for dealing with the establishment of defense and intelligence relationships with former Soviet countries in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union and its nuclear arsenal, and was chairman of NATO&#x27;s High Level Group. He was also responsible for the Counter proliferation Initiative, control of sensitive U.S. exports, and negotiations that led to the deployment of Russian troops as part of the Bosnia Peace Plan Implementation Force.

From April 2009 to October 2011, Carter was Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, with responsibility for DOD&#x27;s procurement reform and innovation agenda and completion of procurements such as the KC-46 tanker. He also led the development and production of thousands of mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles, and other acquisitions. He instituted &quot;Better Buying Power&quot;, seeking smarter and leaner purchasing. From October 2011 to December 2013, Carter was Deputy Secretary of Defense, serving as the DOD&#x27;s chief operating officer, overseeing the department&#x27;s annual budget and its three million civilian and military personnel, steering strategy and budget through sequester, and directing the reform of DOD&#x27;s national security export controls. He was confirmed by Senate voice vote for both positions.

In an April 4, 2013, speech, he affirmed that the &#x27;Shift to Asia&#x27; initiative of President Obama was a priority that would not be affected by the budget sequestration in 2013. Carter noted that &quot;The Shift to Asia&quot; was principally an economic matter with new security implications. India, Australia, and New Zealand were mentioned as forthcoming security partners. His Pentagon arms-control responsibilities included matters involving the START II, ABM, CFE, and other arms-control treaties.

==Secretary of Defense (2015–2017)==
===Nomination and confirmation===
Carter was nominated by President Barack Obama to be the 25th United States secretary of defense on December 5, 2014.

In his nomination hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, he said he was &quot;very much inclined&quot; to increase U.S. military aid to Ukraine. 
Speaking on the Middle East, he said the U.S. must militarily ensure a &quot;lasting defeat&quot; of Islamic State (ISIL) forces in Iraq and Syria. He also opined that the threats posed by Iran were as serious as those posed by the ISIL forces. He said he was not in favor of increasing the rate of prisoner releases from Guantanamo Bay.

Carter was approved unanimously on February 1, 2015, by the Senate Armed Services Committee. He was confirmed by the Senate on February 12 by a vote of 93–5 and sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden on February 17.

===Tenure===

In May 2015, Carter warned the People&#x27;s Republic of China to halt its rapid island-building in the South China Sea.

In October 2015, Carter condemned Russian air strikes against ISIL and other rebel groups in Syria. On October 8, 2015, Carter, speaking at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, said he believed Russia would soon start paying the price for its military intervention in Syria in the form of reprisal attacks and casualties.

A controversy arose in December 2015 when it was revealed that Carter had used a personal email account while conducting official business as Secretary of Defense.

In January 2016, at Carter&#x27;s direction, the Department of Defense opened all military roles to women, overriding a request by the Marine Corps to continue to exempt women from certain positions. In June 2016, Carter announced that transgender individuals would be allowed to join and openly serve in the military.

==Other roles==
From 1990 to 1993, Carter was chairman of the editorial board of &quot;International Security&quot;. Previously, he held positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, and Rockefeller University.

In 1997, Carter and former CIA director John M. Deutch co-chaired the Catastrophic Terrorism Study Group which urged greater attention to terrorism. In 1998, Carter, Deutch, and Philip Zelikow (later executive director of the 9/11 Commission) published an article on &quot;catastrophic terrorism&quot; in Foreign Affairs. From 1998 to 2000, he was deputy to William J. Perry at the North Korea Policy Review and traveled with him to Pyongyang. In 2001–02, he served on the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Science and Technology for Countering Terrorism, and advised on the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Carter was also co-director of the Preventive Defense Project, which designs and promotes security policies aimed at preventing the emergence of major new threats to the United States.

Carter had been a longtime member of the Defense Science Board and the Defense Policy Board, the principal advisory bodies to the Secretary of Defense. During the Bush administration, he was also a member of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&#x27;s International Security Advisory Board; co-chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee&#x27;s Policy Advisory Group; a consultant to the Defense Science Board; a member of the National Missile Defense White Team, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences Committee on International Security and Arms Control. He had testified frequently before the armed services, foreign relations, and homeland security committees of both houses of Congress.

In addition to his public service, Carter was a senior partner at Global Technology Partners, focused on advising investment firms in technology and defense. He was a consultant to Goldman Sachs and Mitretek Systems on international affairs and technology matters, and spoke frequently to business and policy audiences. Carter served as an independent director on the General Electric board of directors from 2020 until his death.

He was also a member of the boards of directors of the Mitre Corporation and Mitretek Systems and the advisory boards of MIT Lincoln Laboratory and Draper Laboratory. Carter was also a member of the Aspen Strategy Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, the American Physical Society, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. Carter was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was named as a Fellow in the American Physical Society (Forum on Physics &amp; Society) in 2015.

Carter served as an honorary director on the board of directors at the Atlantic Council. In April 2021, Carter joined Tanium Board of Directors. From 2021, he had been a member of the President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). In 2021, Carter joined Shield Capital&#x27;s board of Strategic Advisors.

Carter&#x27;s views on Iran had been perceived as hawkish. In 2006, he authored a report for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace advocating use or threat of force to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Carter had supported diplomacy with Iran and written about methods of containing a nuclear-armed Tehran.

===Support for military interventions===

Carter was a supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as well as an advocate of &quot;preventative&quot; invasions of North Korea and Iran. In response to increased tension in Ukraine, Carter considered deployment of ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe that could pre-emptively destroy Russian weapons.

===Military involvement in presidential elections===
In January 2021, Carter, alongside all of the other living former secretaries of defense, published a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed piece opposing President Donald Trump&#x27;s summons for military involvement in overturning the 2020 election results, and urging for a peaceful transition of power.

==Personal life==
Carter was married to Stephanie DeLeeuw Carter. He had been previously married to Clayton Spencer, the eighth president of Bates College, with whom he had two children, Ava and William.

Carter died from a heart attack at his home in Boston, on October 24, 2022, at age 68.

==Awards==
Carter received the Ten Outstanding Young Americans award from the United States Junior Chamber in 1987. For his service to national security, Carter was awarded the DOD&#x27;s highest civilian medal, the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, five times. For critical liaison efforts with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the geographic combatant commanders, he was awarded the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award in 2013 and the Defense Intelligence Medal for his contributions to intelligence. On January 4, 2025, Carter was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden.

==Works==
In addition to authoring numerous articles, scientific publications, government studies, and Congressional testimonies, Carter co-edited and co-authored 11 books:

*&quot;MX Missile Basing&quot; (1981)
*&quot;Ballistic Missile Defense&quot; (1984)
*&quot;Directed Energy Missile Defense in Space&quot; (1984)
*&quot;Managing Nuclear Operations&quot; (1987)
*&quot;Soviet Nuclear Fission: Control of the Nuclear Arsenal in a Disintegrating Soviet Union&quot; (1991)

<text>61 Virginis (abbreviated 61 Vir) a G-type main-sequence star (G7V) slightly less massive than the Sun (which has a hotter G2V spectral type), located away in the constellation of Virgo. The composition of this star is nearly identical to the Sun.

==Description==
61 Virginis is a fifth-magnitude G-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of G7 V. It is faint but visible to the naked eye in the zodiac constellation of Virgo, close to Spica, the brightest star in the constellation. The designation 61 Virginis originated in the star catalogue of English astronomer John Flamsteed, as part of his &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot;. An 1835 account of Flamsteed&#x27;s work by English astronomer Francis Baily noted that the star showed a proper motion. This made the star of interest for parallax studies, and by 1950 a mean annual value of 0.006″ was obtained, resulting in an distance of . The present day result, obtained with data from the Gaia satellite, gives a parallax of 117.17 mas (0.117&quot;), which corresponds to a distance of .

This star is similar in physical properties to the Sun, with around 93% of the Sun&#x27;s mass, 99% of the radius, and 82% of the luminosity. The abundance of elements is also similar to the Sun, with the star having an estimated 95% of the Sun&#x27;s proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium. It is older than the Sun, around 6.1–6.6 billion years old, and is spinning with a leisurely projected rotational velocity of 4 km/s at the equator. On average, there is only a low level of activity in the stellar chromosphere and it is a candidate for being in a Maunder minimum state. But the star was suspected as variable in 1988, and a burst of activity was observed between Julian days [24]54800 (29 November 2008) and 55220 (23 January 2010).

The space velocity components of this star are U = –37.9, V = –35.3 and W = –24.7 km/s. 61 Vir is orbiting through the Milky Way galaxy at a distance of 6.9 kpc from the core, with an eccentricity of 0.15. It is believed to be a member of the disk population.

On 14 December 2009, scientists announced the discovery of three exoplanets with minimum masses between 5 and 25 times that of Earth orbiting 61 Virginis, using the radial velocity method at the Keck and Anglo-Australian Observatories. The three planets all orbit very near the star; when compared to the orbits of the planets in the Solar System, all three would orbit inside that of Venus. The two outer planets likely resemble Uranus and Neptune, while the innermost planet may be a mini-Neptune or a rocky super-Earth.

The outermost of these three planets, 61 Virginis d (also designated HD 115617 d), was initially not detected in the HARPS data as of 2012 until a reanalysis of the data was done in 2023. A 2021 study listed it as a false positive, but in 2023 two published studies further confirmed it based on an additional 10 years of radial velocity data, though with a smaller minimum mass.

Assuming the planets are aligned with the disk around the star, 61 Virginis b, c and d should have masses of .

===Debris disk===
The ecliptic of the 61 Virginis system, as inferred from its dust disc, is inclined to the Solar System at 77°. The star itself is probably inclined at 72°.

A survey with the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed an excess of infrared radiation at a wavelength of 160 μm. This indicated the presence of a debris disk in orbit around the star. This disk was resolved at 70 μm. It was then thought to correspond to an inner radius of 96 AU from the star and outer radius at 195 AU; it is now constrained 30 to over 100 AU. The total mass of the disk is the mass of the Earth.

On 27 November 2012, the European Space Agency declared that the debris disc (like that of the Gliese 581 planetary system) has &quot;at least 10 times&quot; as many comets as does the Solar System&#x27;s Kuiper belt.

===Limits on additional planets===
In 1988, a study surmised that 61 Virginis was a &quot;possible variable&quot;, but no companions were then found. A subsequent study, over eleven years, also failed to find any companion up to the mass of Jupiter and out to 3 AU.

As of 2012, &quot;planets more massive than Saturn orbiting within 6 AU&quot; were ruled out. The ESA has found no evidence for Saturn-mass planets beyond that.

Additional data is needed to confirm the possibility of more sub-Saturn planets between 0.5 and 30 AU from the star. An Earth-mass planet in the star&#x27;s habitable zone (which would still be too small to detect with current technology) remains possible.



== View from 61 Virginis ==
The Sun is visible from the system as a magnitude 4.50 star close to the stars Hamal, Beta Arietis and Alpha Centauri. Arcturus (magnitude −1.01) is the brightest star of the night sky.

<doc id="1229542" wikidata="Q3134367" url="?curid=1229542" title="Parkhead">
<text>Parkhead () is a district in the East End of Glasgow. Its name comes from a small weaving hamlet at the meeting place of the Great Eastern Road (now the Gallowgate and Tollcross Road) and Westmuir Street. Glasgow&#x27;s Eastern Necropolis cemetery was laid out in the area in 1847 beside the Gallowgate. It borders with Shettleston and Tollcross to the immediate east, and Camlachie and Dennistoun to the west.

==History==
The area flourished with the discovery of coal in 1837 and grew into an industrial centre. In 1897 William Beardmore and Company became famous with the production of high grade steel and castings at the local &quot;Parkhead Forge&quot;, founded about 1837 and extended between 1884 and 1914. After years of decline, the massive plant was closed in 1976, and in 1986 the construction of the first phase of The Forge Shopping Centre began on the site. The shopping centre opened in the autumn of 1988, and in 1994 an indoor market was added adjacent to it. The final element, a retail park, was completed in three stages between 1996 and 2002.
Parkhead Cross is a major road junction which is the meeting point of Gallowgate, Duke Street, Westmuir Street, Tollcross Road and Burgher Street, which together form a turreted Edwardian five-way junction, including several fine buildings making the junction notable, such as the former &quot;Glasgow Savings Bank&quot;. The junction, which also incorporates the northern termination of the major Springfield Road thoroughfare, can become very busy due to traffic for football games at nearby Celtic Park.

Most of the district&#x27;s amenities and places of worship are situated within a few blocks of the Cross.

==Hospitals==
Belvidere Hospital, built on the Belvidere estate which extended from London Road to the River Clyde, originally consisted of wooden huts thrown up rapidly when the city&#x27;s older fever hospital at Parliamentary Road was overwhelmed by a typhus epidemic in 1870. A self-contained smallpox hospital of five brick pavilions was built from 1874. After this, nineteen pavilions of red-and-white striped brick were set up for the fever hospital. In recent times, with the general closure of infectious disease hospitals, care of elderly people became its main function before closing in 1999.

Parkhead Hospital, which opened on 12 November 1988, was said to be the only new psychiatric hospital to be built in Scotland in the 20th century. (However, some 18th and 19th century institutions did move to new buildings during the 20th century.) It was built on part of the old forge land, next to the Parkhead Health Centre, and replaced the psychiatric and psycho-geriatric admission wards of both Duke Street Hospital (formerly known as the Eastern District Hospital) and Gartloch Hospital – both units moved into the new hospital in 1988 on the day of a Rangers-Celtic match at the nearby Celtic Park. The hospital closed in 2018, with the intention of building a new health facility on the site.

==Libraries==
Parkhead also has one of Glasgow&#x27;s original Carnegie libraries, deftly designed in the Edwardian Baroque style by James Robert Rhind.

==Sport==
===Celtic Park and Barrowfield===

Parkhead is perhaps best known as the home of Celtic Football Club and their stadium Celtic Park, which opened in 1892 after the club moved across the road from their old ground, which they had been playing on for their first three years. A journalist covering the event reported that it was like &quot;moving from the graveyard to paradise&quot;, referencing the proximity of the adjacent cemetery, hence the nickname &quot;Paradise&quot;. Celtic Park is located at 95 Kerrydale Street, just off London Road. The stadium itself is commonly referred to as &#x27;Parkhead&#x27; because of its location. The stadium was substantially rebuilt between 1994 and 1998 and is Scotland&#x27;s largest football stadium by seating capacity.

From the early 1960s, Celtic conducted most of their training routines at a facility on the periphery of Parkhead named Barrowfield, east of Celtic Park (it is not located in the Barrowfield residential area which lies to the west of the stadium toward Bridgeton). By 2005, those facilities were seen as antiquated, particularly in comparison to those of their Old Firm rivals Rangers at Auchenhowie. Celtic considered building new facilities at their site in Barrowfield, but instead decided to develop the Lennoxtown training centre outside the city. Today there are still football pitches on the land as well as a large Celtic social club; the Celtic first team temporarily resumed training at Barrowfield in November 2011, after a spate of training ground injuries led manager Neil Lennon to fear that the Lennoxtown pitches were responsible. In 2019, Celtic announced plans to redevelop Barrowfield for use by their youth academy and women&#x27;s team, including an indoor pitch and a matchday venue, augmenting the Lennoxtown base which would continue to be used by the first team squad and strengthening their connection to their roots in the East End of Glasgow.

===Other===
Prior to its dissolution, Parkhead FC was one of the most successful Junior sides of the first half of the 20th century. Two other strong teams of the time, Bridgeton Waverley and Strathclyde also had their grounds in close proximity (New Barrowfield and Springfield Park respectively); none of the three clubs survived into the late 20th century. Parkhead&#x27;s ground &quot;Helenslea Park&quot; is now a landscaped public park.

There are also two bowling clubs and a derelict sports ground (&quot;Helenvale Park&quot;, formerly used by the Glasgow Corporation Transport department which had a large bus and tram depot nearby) in the vicinity – &quot;Crownpoint Sports Complex&quot;, a replacement modern outdoor athletics track, is located beyond the western border of the district adjacent to St Mungo&#x27;s Academy. After the 2014 Commonwealth Games was held in Glasgow, Parkhead now has international-class sporting facilities within walking distance: the Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome are located in nearby Dalmarnock.

<doc id="1229547" wikidata="Q20907962" url="?curid=1229547" title="Island spotted skunk">
<text>The island spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis amphiala) is an insular endemic carnivore and a subspecies of the western spotted skunk (&quot;Spilogale gracilis&quot;). Little is known about their exact variations from the mainland spotted skunk and variations between locations, resolution of which awaits further genetic and morphologic evaluation. The skunk is only currently found on two islands off the southern coast of California (Santa Cruz Island, and Santa Rosa Island, where its occurrence is rare). Its presence has been recorded on San Miguel Island, but it has since been declared extinct in that area. The Channel Island skunk is one of two terrestrial carnivores on the islands, the other being the island fox. It is designated as a &quot;species of special concern&quot; by the state of California.

==Distribution and habitat==

===Range===
The island spotted skunk is endemic to the Channel Islands off the coast of Southern California. It currently is only found on Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz islands where it is widely distributed. There are previous reports of this taxon living on San Miguel island as well. Record of its inhabitance on San Miguel island ceased after the late nineteen hundreds and it is believed to be extirpated from this region. As of 2011, there were reportedly 3,000 Island Spotted Skunks on Santa Rosa island alone. However, after the recovery of the island fox in the mid-2000s, skunk sightings have become rare once again.

===Habitat===
The island spotted skunk exhibits habitat preferences similar to those of the mainland species. Its dens have been found in various types of locations including, but not limited to, beneath shrubs, open grasslands, rocky slopes, and beneath the roots of large trees. Difference in habitat preference varied slightly between the two islands. Skunks on Santa Rosa mainly being found in rocky canyon slopes, cactus patches, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, open woodland areas, and riparian habitats along streams. On Santa Cruz Island, skunks are found to prefer chaparral-grasslands, open grasslands, fennel-grasslands, and ravines. Skunks were also found to make dens beneath human dwellings and buildings.

==Description==
Island spotted skunks show little morphological variation between islands, aside from the skunks found on Santa Rosa Island being slightly longer than those found on Santa Cruz Island. It is distinguished from mainland spotted skunks by its shorter tail with less white ventral coloration (45% white compared to 55% white), slightly larger size, broader skull, and proportionately less white and more black in pelage color. They also tend to have smoother, glossier fur than the mainland variation. It can be identified by an arrangement of white stripes on black fur, running vertically down the back. There are 4 to 6 stripes and they are usually broken up to give the skunk its “spotted” appearance. The abdomen is white and there is also a small white triangle on the forehead. On average, males tend to be about 23% larger than females.

==Behavior==

===Diet===
Island skunks exhibit similar diets to those of mainland skunks. They are carnivorous, and unlike their mainland relatives who mostly consume insects, feed primarily on Island Deer Mice. Analysis of skunks on Santa Cruz Island showed consumption of insects and occasional lizards in addition to the Deer Mice. Insects consisted mainly of Jerusalem Crickets, along with grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, caterpillars, ear wigs, and ants. Seasonally available fruits and berries are also part of the skunks diet, including grapes, summer holly, stems, and cactus fruits. The Channel Island skunk is one of two terrestrial carnivores living on the island, the other being the Island Fox. The two species are in competition for resources and the Island Skunk&#x27;s diet became more omnivorous in the 1990s due to a decrease in Island Fox populations. In recent years, skunks have been observed expanding their carnivorous diets to include seabirds. The birds typically nest in sea caves and this recent expansion has been attributed to an increase in population following the decline of foxes.

===Activity===
Skunks are nocturnal animals. Activity begins at dusk, peaks during early evening, and continues until dawn. Individuals use several dens distributed throughout their home range. Females have been known to simultaneously share a den, while males are more likely to share the same den sequentially.

===Reproduction===
Channel Island skunks have similar mating behaviors to mainland skunks and exhibit the same delayed implantation. Mating occurs throughout the months of September and October, followed by delayed implantation, and a 210- to 310-day gestation period. They typically give birth during the months of April and May to anywhere from 2 to 6 young.

==Conservation status==
The Island spotted skunk is listed as a species of special concern by the state of California. This is because populations were thought to be low due to rare sightings which restrict the ability to study it, and therefore little was known about the subspecies. Although it was thought to be more abundant in the past (early 20th century), it is now listed as a Class II status of concern due to its restricted distribution. The skunk&#x27;s small population size can be attributed to several factors. The first of which being loss and degradation of habitat resulting from over grazing by domestic livestock (cattle and horses) and feral nonnative herbivores (sheep, deer, elk). Another possible threat to the skunk is introduction of diseases by domestic cats and dogs brought to the island as pets. The species occurs widely on Santa Cruz island, but is uncommon to rare, and is more common on Santa Rosa island. During the 1990s, the island skunk population saw an increase due to reduced competition from their natural competitor, the island fox. The fox&#x27;s population decreased dramatically following the colonization of the Channel Islands by the golden eagle.

===Conservation efforts===
Action has been taken to try and increase skunk populations on the islands. In the early 1980s 38,000 feral sheep were removed from Santa Cruz Island and cattle ranching operations terminated in 1988. Despite these efforts, feral pigs continue to pose a great threat to skunk populations as their rooting destroys skunk dens. Skunks are specialized in their resources and therefore sensitive to competition with feral pigs for invertebrate foods. The future of skunk populations on Santa Rosa Island is expected to be positive due to the eradication of feral pigs in the &#x27;80s.

===Updated status===
The status of skunks on Santa Cruz Island was reevaluated in 1998, six years after previous research done in 1992, which helped to determine the Island skunks as rare or of special concern. Across the six-year period a sudden increase in skunk populations was observed. This was attributed to several possible factors such as high rainfall in 1998 after many years of drought, which was thought to have stimulated plant growth. This could have in turn, stimulated reproduction because of the delayed implantation exhibited by the skunks which could allow them to increase fecundity during good years. Additionally, the skunks could be responding to recovery efforts on the island. The skunks most direct competitor for resources, the island fox, had also been exhibiting a population decline which would result in less competition for the resource specific island skunk. Skunk populations showed a remarkable increase over a ten-year period, and in 2011 approximately 3,000 skunks were marked and counted during population monitoring. As fox populations recovered in the 2000s and 2010s, skunk captures became rare once again.

==Recent genetic testing==
Recent genetic research was done on Channel Island skunks to determine genetic variation in skunks between islands. Morphologically skunks on both islands do not seem to vary whatsoever, except that the skunks on Santa Rosa Island are slightly longer than those on Santa Cruz Island. The study found that genetic variation between the two island species was not consistent with the morphological variation and was much greater than that of the mainland species. This conclusion has led researchers to hypothesize that spotted skunks were brought to the islands either by rafting or intentionally by Native Americans. The genetic variation between mainland skunks and those on the islands is enough to cause researchers to propose that the taxonomic classification of the skunks as &quot;S. g. amphiala&quot; be reconsidered, and that each island population be considered a separate subspecies or even a new species separate from the mainland one.
