<text>Piha is a coastal settlement in West Auckland, on the western coast of the Auckland Region in New Zealand. It is one of the most popular beaches in the area and a major day-trip destination for Aucklanders throughout the year, and especially in summer.

Piha is 39 kilometres west of Auckland city centre, on the Tasman Sea coast to the north of the Manukau Harbour, on the western edge of the Waitākere Ranges. Immediately to the north of Piha is Whites Beach, and immediately to the south is Te Unuhanga-a-Rangitoto / Mercer Bay; land access to both is only by foot. The nearest beaches accessible by road are Karekare to the south, and Anawhata to the north.

==History==

The area is traditionally a part of rohe of the Tāmaki Māori tribe Te Kawerau ā Maki. The area is named for Te Piha, the traditional name of Lion Rock which was later applied to the wider area, and refers to the pattern made when waves hit against the rock. The area was the location of many pā and villages, including a headland at Te Waha Point north of the beach, where many karaka trees associated with the former pā grow, and Lion Rock, which was the location of Whakaari pā. Archaeological surveys have shown the remains of platforms, midden and terraces on Lion Rock, as well as fragments of traditional textiles, dating back to a time before European contact. The earthworks of Whakaari pā are not well preserved due to erosion.

Te Unuhanga-a-Rangitoto / Mercer Bay to the south was traditionally known by the name Te Unuhanga o Rangitoto, referencing the traditional story of Te Kawerau ā Maki of early ancestor Tiriwa, who formed the bay by moving Rangitoto Island from the West coast to the Hauraki Gulf / Tīkapa Moana. The English language name references Andrew Mercer, an Auckland settler who received Crown grant in June 1866.

At the turn of the 20th century, holidaymakers would travel by coach from Glen Eden to stay at guest houses in Piha. In February 1939, two Australian visitors to Auckland, G R Mackey and J A Talbot, committed arson at a Piha bach. The fire was lit as a part of an insurance scam, and a body of a recently buried soldier was taken from Waikumete Cemetery and placed inside the bach.

Albert Percy Godber took photographs in the are in the 1910s.

Since 1992, six people have disappeared from or in the area of Piha with no trace, with one of the more publicised cases being Iraena Asher and the most recent being French teenager Eloi Rolland in 2020. No trace has been left by any of these people, and none of them have been found.

Piha suffered floods and slips from Cyclone Gabrielle in early 2023, and the main road out was closed to non-residents until May 2023.

==Demographics==
Piha is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement, and covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Piha had a population of 1,044 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 60 people (6.1%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 186 people (21.7%) since the 2013 census.

== Features and geology ==
As well as two surf beaches there are also a sheltered lagoon and several streams in the area. The coastline and forested Waitākere Ranges offer a number of walks, or tramps, ranging from easy to very difficult. Due to the spread of the incurable kauri dieback disease large parts of the Waitākere Ranges were closed from 2018 until further notice.

Piha is a well known black sand beach, due to the high iron content, which originated from Mount Taranaki and earlier volcanoes in the area.

Lion Rock is a natural formation dividing North and South Piha beaches. It is an eroded 16-million-year-old volcanic neck, named for its similarity to a lying male lion when viewed from the rear (shore side), Lion Rock is immediately visible to visitors as they descend along the only access road. Lion Rock has become iconic not only of Piha, but of Auckland&#x27;s West Coast in general. Lion Rock was featured on stamps as well as an Auckland phone book, and in December 1919 a memorial to local sawmillers who served in World War One was unveiled on Lion Rock.

About 2 km inland, on the Glen Esk stream, are the Kitekite Falls which while not very large are picturesque. Swimming is possible all seasons (though only for the cold hardened outside of summer) in a pool just above the falls. At the bottom of the falls is a sheltered picnic area popular with families in the summer time. There is another pool between the top falls and the bottom falls, but is closed due to Kauri dieback.

About 2 km inland, on the Piha Stream, is a small canyon.

About 1 km south of the South Beach is &#x27;The Gap&#x27;, which at low tide provides another lagoon and a blowhole.

== Surfing ==

Piha was the birthplace of New Zealand board riding in 1958, and has been the scene of both New Zealand national and international surfing championship competitions.

==Surf lifesaving==
Two surf lifesaving clubs provide surf patrols in summer. Piha Surf Life Saving Club, the home of the TV series &quot;Piha Rescue&quot;, patrols the section of the beach to the south of Lion Rock. United North Piha Lifeguard Service is responsible for the section of the beach north of Lion Rock. Both clubs provide patrolled areas designated by red and yellow flags as is the custom with Surf Lifesaving in New Zealand and many other countries.

== Safety information==
The rip currents along this section of coast are very unpredictable and can shift with little warning. They claim many lives despite the efforts of surf life-savers. Most of these drownings, however, occur after lifeguards are off duty or after rock fisherman wearing heavy clothing are washed off rocks, out of sight of the lifeguards. Lifeguards advise swimming between the red and yellow flags, during patrol hours.

After the death of two men at Piha in February 2013, lifeguards say the water fools swimmers by appearing deceptively calm, obscuring strong rips, and people should stay out of the water if they are not confident swimmers.

== &quot;Piha Rescue&quot;==
Piha Beach was the setting for a popular New Zealand reality television show. Aptly named &quot;Piha Rescue&quot;, it ran for 12 series over 14 years on TV1 and it featured the lives of the surf life savers at Piha Beach and educated the public on the beach safety, rip currents and swimming between the flags.

<text>Yigal Carmon (; born 1946) is the president and cofounder of the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), an organization which monitors and translates Arabic and Persian publications; radio and TV broadcasts; and religious sermons into many languages and circulates them over the Internet.

Carmon was a colonel at Aman, the Israeli military intelligence service, and later counter-terrorism advisor to Israeli prime ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Yitzhak Shamir.

==Early life and education ==
Yigal Carmon was born in Romania in 1946 and immigrated to Israel with his family at age four. He grew up in Hadera. In high school, he began to study Arabic, and eventually achieved native-level fluency. At age 18, he had his conscription to the Israel Defense Forces deferred so he could study as part of the Atuda program. After earning a degree in Orientalism from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, he joined the IDF in 1968 and served in the Intelligence Corps until 1988, reaching the rank of Colonel. 

== Career ==
From 1977 to 1981, he served as an adviser on Arab affairs to the Civil Administration in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. When Menahem Milson was appointed to serve as head of the Civil Administration, Carmon was appointed his deputy. During his term as advisor, Carmon helped Milson create the Palestinian Village Leagues as a short-lived, rural and clan based alternative to the Palestine Liberation Organization. Carmon was appointed acting head of the Civil Administration 26 September 1982 after Milson&#x27;s 22 September resignation. He served in that position until Shlomo Ilya became the Administration&#x27;s head 29 November.

In 1988, Carmon was appointed adviser on counterterrorism for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Following the fall of the Shamir government in 1992, he served for a year as Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s counterterrorism adviser before resigning in 1993 due to his opposition to the Oslo Accords. From 1991 to 1992 he was also a part of the Israeli delegation to peace negotiations with Syria in Washington.
In 1998, Carmon founded MEMRI.

Carmon has also testified before the US Congress and European parliaments.

==Views==
===On reporting &quot;difficult realities&quot;===
According to Ruthie Blum, writing in the Jerusalem Post, Carmon and MEMRI&#x27;s translations of material appearing in the Arabic and Persian media, &quot;have been received with a combination of angst and ambivalence on the part of the press and politicians who don&#x27;t like what they&#x27;re seeing.&quot;

Carmon relates that his experience of portraying difficult realities in the Arab-Muslim world: &quot;In 1994-5, before MEMRI was formally established, I taped TV broadcasts of [Palestinian Authority chairman] Arafat calling for jihad. The reaction to that tape was: &#x27;Kill the messenger&#x27;...And I protested by saying, &#x27;But it&#x27;s not me [calling for jihad]; it&#x27;s him [Arafat].&#x27;
To which they replied, &#x27;That doesn&#x27;t matter.&#x27;. Then one day, I asked a very senior journalist with whom I was friendly, &#x27;Why are you criticizing our work? We&#x27;re merely revealing the truth.&#x27; His reply is one I&#x27;ll never forget: &#x27;There is no such thing as truth,&#x27; he said. &#x27;Every news item must be judged by the question of whom it serves. And you are serving the enemies of peace.&#x27; Horrified, I retorted, &quot;And you&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s considered the reliable journalist, while I&#x27;m seen as biased?&#x27; So he said, &#x27;If you want to play naive, do it with someone else, not with me. You know I&#x27;m right.&#x27;
&#x27;No,&#x27; I said. &#x27;I do not know that you&#x27;re right. There is such a thing as truth, and it is impartial&#x27;

===On the English version of Al-Jazeera TV===
&quot;If they copy the Arabic version...into English, then they will be committing suicide. Because the whole world will see what role Al Jazeera is playing in making the Muslim world extreme...[On the other hand, if the two channels were to take different stances on global issues, the organization would be] &#x27;speak[ing] from two sides of its mouth&#x27;.&quot;

==Criticism==
Journalist Brian Whitaker in 2002 accused Carmon of presenting false testimony to Congress when he allegedly misrepresented a Gallup poll. Responding to his charge of having an agenda, Carmon wrote &quot;You are right: we do have an agenda. As an institute of research, we want MEMRI to present translations to people who wish to be informed on the ideas circulating in the Middle East. We aim to reflect reality. If knowledge of this reality should benefit one side or another, then so be it.&quot;

Regarding Whitaker&#x27;s criticism of Carmon&#x27;s &quot;political background&quot;, Carmon responded that: 
&quot;You continually refer to my supposed &quot;political background&quot; as if I had something to hide, and I wonder if I am your real target here. As a civil servant and adviser on counter-terrorism to both Yitzhak Shamir and Yitzhak Rabin, prime ministers from opposing camps, my role was not a political appointment. If your complaint is that I am Israeli, then please say so.&quot;

Carmon also questioned Whitaker&#x27;s own biases, stating that:

I note your website is &quot;Al-Bab&quot; (&quot;The Gateway&quot; in Arabic). Would I be justified in concluding that you are not, in fact, completely neutral about the Middle East, even though you are Middle East editor of a national newspaper? I wonder how you would judge an editor whose website was called &quot;Ha-Sha-ar&quot; (&quot;The Gateway&quot; in Hebrew)?

Responding to Carmon, Whitaker in the final rejoinder responded, and asked why Carmon had omitted why one of the Arab poet’s identity as a Palestinian had been omitted:You appear to think this is a trivial matter, but it goes to the heart of Memri&#x27;s credibility. On any self-respecting newspaper, a reporter who messed about with other people&#x27;s words like that would be in serious trouble. Again, with your translation of al-Watan&#x27;s poem, you offer no explanation as to why the only word omitted, between the title and the last line, was the word that identified the poet as a Palestinian rather than an Arab-American.

You say the poet&#x27;s identity was not the point, but in the context it was clearly relevant.

Once again, I must return to the deeply troubling question of the Gallup poll - which you shrug off with a facetious suggestion about spending $90 on the report.

The fact is that you gave evidence to Congress claiming that Gallup had found &quot;a large majority of the Arab world&quot; who believed the September 11 attacks &quot;were the work of the United States government itself and/or a Jewish conspiracy&quot;. What you said is untrue, and Gallup has confirmed that. I trust you will now apologise to Congress for your false testimony. Finally, in the light of your most recent remarks about me personally, I will make clear now that your nationality and religion do not bother me in the slightest. What does concern me is your political agenda, and the deceitful way you go about promoting it.

<text>LECO Corporation, founded in 1936 by Carl Schultz and George Krasl, operates its analytical instrumentation research and development, and manufacturing from its headquarters located in St. Joseph, Michigan. LECO develops and manufactures elemental measurement and molecular Time-of-flight mass spectrometry instrumentation, following ISO 9000 standards. The LECO trademark is an acronym of the original name, Laboratory Equipment Corporation. One of LECO&#x27;s early products was a combustion analyzer invented by Krasl in 1957 that used crucibles invented by his employee Eugene Bennet., 

LECO carries out research in many fields of analytical chemistry including protein measurement in foods, sulfur in coal emissions, glow discharge emission in metals, multi-dimensional gas chromatograph mass spectrometry, environmental monitoring, air quality, Metabolomics, and diverse medical and pharmaceutical applications. LECO has been a manufacturer and distributor of metallographic equipment since the 1970s, and makes ceramic products for the foundry industry. LECO Corporation has sales subsidiaries worldwide.

As of June 8, 1977, Robert J. Warren (1933-2022), husband of Elizabeth D. Schultz and son-in-law of Carl Schultz, and family have become the sole owners of the company, acquiring outstanding stocks which had become the property of the George J. Krasl Trust following George Krasl&#x27;s death on August 5, 1976. Bob Warren was hired by LECO in 1968 and became its president in 1975. LECO became a worldwide supplier of instruments and metallographic equipment under Warren&#x27;s management, and one of southwestern Michigan&#x27;s larger employers.

<doc id="1228773" wikidata="Q2615482" url="?curid=1228773" title="Brighton Beach station (BMT Brighton Line)">
<text>The Brighton Beach station is an elevated express and terminal station on the BMT Brighton Line of the New York City Subway. It is located over Brighton Beach Avenue between Brighton 5th Street and Brighton 7th Street in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. The station is served by the Q train at all times and is the southern terminal for the B train on weekdays only.

== History ==
This station opened on July 2, 1878, as part of an excursion railroad—the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway—to bring beachgoers from downtown Brooklyn (via a connection with the Long Island Rail Road) to the seashore at Coney Island on the Atlantic Ocean, at a location named Brighton Beach at the same time the railroad arrived.

On August 1, 1920, a tunnel under Flatbush Avenue opened, connecting the Brighton Line to the Broadway subway in Manhattan. At the same time, the line&#x27;s former track connections to the Fulton Street Elevated were severed. Subway trains from Manhattan and elevated trains from Franklin Avenue served Brighton Line stations, sharing the line to Coney Island.

During the 1964–1965 fiscal year, work was underway to lengthen the platforms to to accommodate a ten-car train of -long IND cars, or a nine-car train of -long BMT cars.

The station was renovated during the 1990s.

From September 8, 2002, to May 23, 2004, service was suspended west of Brighton Beach to allow rebuilding of the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue terminal station, which had deteriorated due to the effects of salt water corrosion and deferred maintenance.

==Station layout==

Brighton Beach has two island platforms and four tracks. The weekday-only B train (Brighton Express/Sixth Avenue Express) originates and terminates here on the inner express tracks while the full-time Q train (Brighton Local/Broadway Express) stops here on the outer local tracks, and continues to and from Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue. The next stop to the west (railroad south) is Ocean Parkway for Q trains, while the next stop to the east (railroad north) is Sheepshead Bay for all service.

Between this station and Ocean Parkway, the line becomes six tracks. The local and express tracks split into an extra storage track in-between them in both directions. These tracks are commonly used for storing B trains during midday hours or at the start or end of service, and they end at bumper blocks next to the platforms at Ocean Parkway. East of this station, there are diamond crossovers used by originating and terminating B trains. The Brighton Line curves north and becomes an embankment after crossing Neptune Avenue on the approach to Sheepshead Bay.

The platforms are canopied for their entire length except for small portions at either ends. There are two elevated structures above the express tracks used for office and maintenance space.

This station has two entrances/exits, both of which are elevated station houses beneath the tracks. The full-time side is at the north end and has two staircases from each platform, a large waiting area inside fare control, regular turnstile bank, and token booth. Outside of fare control, there are three street stairs, two that join at the station house balcony and go down to either southern corners of Brighton 7th Street and Brighton Beach Avenue and one to the northwest corner. Instead of a staircase, the northeast corner has a narrow, enclosed escalator that always goes up and thus can only be used to enter the station.

The second station house has a single staircase from each platform and a pair of twin staircases going down to either side of Brighton Beach Avenue between Brighton Fifth and Brighton Sixth Streets. The token booth and regular turnstile bank here is only open weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Two HEET turnstiles provide access to/from this entrance at other times.

This station was renovated in the mid to late 1990s and included installation of decorative awnings on all street stairs. The 1999 artwork here is called &quot;Mermaid/Dionysus and the Pirates&quot; by Dan George and features aluminum sculptures on both platforms.

===Exits===
The station has two mezzanines under the platforms and tracks, each of which has four sets of stairs to the street and one to each platform. The eastern, and staffed entrances are located between Brighton 7th Street and Coney Island Avenue. There is an up-only escalator in place of one of the stairs on the northern side of Brighton Beach Avenue at Coney Island Avenue. The western exit, which is unstaffed, is located between Brighton 5th and 6th Streets.

<doc id="1228774" wikidata="Q792249" url="?curid=1228774" title="Axel Wenner-Gren">
<text>Axel Lennart Wenner-Gren (5 June 1881 – 24 November 1961) was a Swedish entrepreneur and one of the wealthiest men in the world during the 1930s.

== Early life ==
He was born on 5 June 1881 in Uddevalla, a town on the west coast of Sweden. He was the fourth of six children (four girls and two boys) born to Leonard and the much younger Alice Wenner-Gren (née Albin); only three of the children survived to adulthood: Axel, his oldest sister (Anna), and his younger brother (Hugo). His father owned a farm and exported timber to England, which made the family wealthy.

Having spent his school years in Uddevalla, Wenner-Gren moved to Gothenburg where he was employed for five years in the spice importing company of a maternal uncle. During this time, he learned English, French, and German at the local Berlitz school, and music at the local YMCA.
In 1902, at the age of 21, he left Sweden to further his studies in Germany. He first studied in the university town of Greifswald, where he took some summer courses before moving on to Berlin, where he studied at the Berliner Handelsakademie, from which he graduated early.

==Career==
After some difficulty, he found work with the German subsidiary of Alfa Laval Separator where he developed skills as a salesman, before quitting in 1904 to work selling agricultural machinery near Stuttgart which, with financial support from his father, had become his first financial enterprise.

In 1908, he traveled to America where he learned about engines for agricultural use, returning to Europe the same year. While in Vienna in 1908 he saw the Santo vacuum cleaner in the shop of Gustaf Paalen who had exclusive rights to distribute them throughout Europe. After initially failing to become a European distributor for the Santo vacuum cleaner in his own right, he entered into a partnership with Paalen, purchasing a twenty percent interest in the company.

Earlier in his life he notably collaborated with Fredrik Ljungström.

Wenner-Gren amassed a fortune from his early insight that the industrial vacuum cleaner could be adapted for domestic use. Soon after the First World War he persuaded the Swedish lighting company (called Lux at the time, but with his suggestion to rename it to Electrolux) for which he then worked (securing the contract to floodlight the opening ceremony of the Panama Canal, among other successes), to buy the patent to a home vacuum cleaner. He asked that instead of compensating him in cash, he would receive company stock based on the sales of the vacuum cleaner. The Electrolux cleaner was so successful that by the early 1930s, Wenner-Gren had become the majority owner of Electrolux, and the firm was a leading brand in both vacuum cleaner and refrigerator technology.

Wenner-Gren also diversified his interests into the ownership of newspapers, banks and arms manufacturers, and acquired many of the holdings of the disgraced safety-match tycoon Ivar Kreuger. In Mexico in the 1930s, he was in economic alliance with Maximino Ávila Camacho, strongman of the Mexican state of Puebla, whose brother Manuel Ávila Camacho became President of Mexico in 1940.

==World War II blacklisting==
Wenner-Gren was reported to be a friend of Hermann Göring, whose first wife was a Swede, and in the late 1930s convinced himself that he could avert the coming world war by acting as a conduit between Göring and the British and American governments. His efforts proved unsuccessful, with all parties regarding him as a self-promoting nuisance without much influence on the plans of the Nazi regime. However, others are suspicious of his role in the war, citing how (his) original Bank of the Bahamas was used to fund the Nazis and his friendship with Göring as potential proof of his private support for the Nazis.

A disconsolate Wenner-Gren retired to his estate in The Bahamas, in Hog Island (now Paradise Island), where he resumed his friendship with the islands&#x27; governor, the Duke of Windsor, and former King of the United Kingdom, Edward VIII. Early in the war his rumored friendship with Göring and the German sympathies of the Duke led first the Americans and, following their lead, the British, to place him on an economic blacklist, enabling them to freeze his assets in Nassau. 

There proved to be little or no foundation to their suspicions that Wenner-Gren was a Nazi agent, notwithstanding the appearance of his steam yacht &quot;Southern Cross&quot; (the world&#x27;s largest at the time) along with ships from the Allied Navies at the site of the sinking of the liner on the first day of the war. Wenner-Gren&#x27;s yacht &quot;Southern Cross&quot; rescued over three hundred survivors of the sinking and transferred some to nearby Allied ships and others continued to the U.S.

==Other ventures==

In the 1950s, Wenner-Gren also got involved in the early computer business. For a railroad project connecting California with Alaska, he got in touch with Glenn Hagen, previously an engineer with Northrop Aircraft, who had founded Logistics Research in Redondo Beach outside Los Angeles, developing computers based on magnetic drum memory. In November 1952, Wenner-Gren helped the company to incorporate. He soon controlled the company and renamed it ALWAC (the Axel L. Wenner-Gren Automatic Computer). ALWAC I was used in 1953, ALWAC II and ALWAC III in 1954, ALWAC III-E in 1955. In 1956 and 1957, the model ALWAC III-E was considered a competitor to the IBM 650, having fewer parts and good economy, but no more than 30 units seem to have been delivered. Soon after this, magnetic drum machines were made obsolete by the introduction of the magnetic core memory. 

By 1956 the number of employees tripled to over 300 and the company was relocated to an industrial park in Hawthorne, California. The appearance of the transistor in the electronics industry in 1957 was a financial shock for all vacuum tube computer makers and by 1958 ALWAC in Hawthorne closed and its employees, with the help of Wenner-Gren himself, were successfully hired by Litton Industries and Autonetics and several smaller electronics companies. The follow-up ALWAC 800 was a failed design that never went beyond prototype, using not only core memory but also magnetic logic (a combination of semiconductor diodes and magnetic cores, cf. Hewitt Crane), and presold contracts nearly ruined the company. 

Development was transferred to Sweden in 1958. The next model, named Wegematic 1000, a slight upgrade of the III-E, was shipped in 1960. Only a dozen were delivered and half of them were give-aways to universities, including one unit for the Weizmann Institute in Israel. In exchange, Wenner-Gren received several honorary titles.

Among Wenner-Gren&#x27;s other interests were monorail train systems. His company, ALWEG, built the original Disneyland Monorail System in 1959 and the Seattle Center Monorail in 1962. Wenner-Gren continued his fascination with speculative railway projects, as he collaborated with Canadian W.A.C. Bennett to build a railway north from Prince George into the untapped Peace River, Rocky Mountain Trench and eventually Alaska. Parts of the railway were built by the Pacific Great Eastern Railway after Wenner-Gren&#x27;s death, including the needless Fort Nelson branch, yet the meeting produced outcomes lasting to this day. The interest in the north spurred a spate of mega-industrial projects in the region: the Bennett Dam flooding vast valleys, gas pipelines and plants at Taylor, coal mines and pulp mills.

==Personal life==
In late 1909, while returning from a trip to America on board a trans-Atlantic liner, he met Marguerite Gauntier Liggett who had been born on 15 October 1891 in Kansas City, Missouri. She was traveling with her sister, actress Gene Gauntier, to Europe to complete her musical training as an opera singer. After a brief romance at sea, they traveled to London, where they married on 14 December 1909 before traveling on to Berlin where she would complete her studies.

Wenner-Gren died of cancer while staying at the Red Cross Hospital in Stockholm.

===The Viking Fund===

Wenner-Gren also founded and endowed The Viking Fund in 1941, an organization supporting anthropological research. In 1941, the endowment funded the Wenner-Gren Aeronautical Research Laboratory, now called the Wenner-Gren Laboratory at the University of Kentucky. The lab has since changed its focus to Biomedical Engineering. The Viking fund was later renamed the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

<text>The Abbotsford International Airshow is held annually on the second Friday, Saturday and Sunday in August at Abbotsford International Airport in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada.

It is Canada&#x27;s largest airshow. In the mid-1970s, Abbotsford was designated as Canada&#x27;s National Airshow by Prime Minister Pierre E. Trudeau. It features both military and civilian aircraft from Canada and the United States, and on occasion has had military aircraft from other countries. These include Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, The Netherlands, Brazil, Chile and Ukraine.

==History==

The airshow was started in 1962 by the Abbotsford Flying Club.

The show experienced continuous growth through the 1960s and 1970s.

The 1986 show was conducted in conjunction with Expo 86, the Vancouver world&#x27;s fair. This saw the inclusion of several European teams like the Patrouille de France and the Frecce Tricolori to the traditional participants ... as well as the Soviet-Ukrainian Antonov AN-124.

In 1989, the show set a three-day attendance record of 321,000 people. The USSR was represented by a large number of aircraft at Abbotsford. Making their North American debuts were two MiG-29 Fulcrums (a single and two-seater), an Su-26M aerobatic plane, a Ka-32 helicopter and the An-225 Mriya, the world&#x27;s largest aircraft. The MiG-29 demonstration pilot was Anatoly Kvochur, who had ejected out of a Mig-29 at Le Bourget, France, just months earlier. History was made at Abbotsford on the last day of the show when Major Bob Wade, Canadian Armed Forces CF-18 Hornet pilot, became the first Western pilot to fly a modern fighter jet from the USSR. Wade took the controls of the Mig-29UB two-seat aircraft with Soviet test pilot Valery Menitsky. Other highlights at the show included the first appearance at Abbotsford for the only airworthy Lancaster bomber in North America and the return of the USAF Thunderbirds for the first time since 1981.

Post Cold War defence cuts affected the attendance of military teams and aircraft throughout the 1990s. Poor financial management resulted in the annual show being canceled in 1998 and returning in 1999.

In 1994 Dan and Loretta Newall got married before the start of the show, the first wedding in the 33-year history of the show. The vows were almost inaudible due to the Harriers taking off six minutes ahead of schedule. The wedding cake was shared with people around the wedding site. CTV gave them five minutes of air time on the news.

In 1995, while the Abbotsford Airshow included an arms trade aspect, Project Censored Canada rated it as the eighth most censored news story of the year. The trade expo saw delegates visit from countries such as the United States and Saudi Arabia to inspect and purchase weaponry.

Celebrating its fortieth anniversary in 2002 was a significant accomplishment; it was a milestone year while airshows across North America were threatened with cancellation due to high insurance costs after 9/11.

In 2014 it was named one of the ten best airshows in the world, and also held a twilight show for the first time. In December 2014 the airshow won a prestigious Silver Pinnacle award from the International Council of Airshows.

In 2015 the airshow continued its successful twilight show and had the Breitling jet team from France perform its first Canadian show. In addition, the airshow hosted the USAF F-22 Raptor for the first time.

In 2016 two 5th generation USAF F-35A Lightning II fighter jets made history as this marked the first appearance of an F-35 in Canada. Although two aircraft were at the airshow only one was put on static display.

==Present==

The show is now operated by the Abbotsford International Airshow Society. It occurs annually in the Summer, and typically in Mid-August due to optimal weather conditions.

==Performers==

Currently the duo consisting of Roy Hafeli &amp; Ken Hildebrandt, more commonly known as H2A2 or Hafeli and Hildebrandt Airshow Announcers provide the Airshow announcing every year.

Roy Hafeli began announcing at Abbotsford in 1999, and is a recipient of the North West Council of Air Shows 2005 Showmanship award and the 2006 Eric Beard Memorial Spirit of Flight award. Roy also announces at many other airshows throughout Canada and the USA as well as at other special events.

Ken Hildebrandt is the newest voice at Abbotsford. He began announcing in 2007. Having attended every Abbotsford show since 1979, he noticed that while he was certainly enthralled by the many amazing flying machines that screamed over his head each summer, he became particularly interested in the people who announced the action over the loud speakers. Thus began a thirty-year interest in airshow announcing.

==Accidents and incidents during aerial display==

* August 8, 1969 At noon a Boeing 747 airliner flew the 75 miles from Paine Field in Everett, Washington to make its first public airshow appearance completing three left to right flybys including a final low level slow pass to open the first day of the three day airshow. Immediately after a Mini Mustang entered the flight line from the left for a low inverted pass. Near midfield the Mini Mustang gyrated violently and dove into the ground killing the pilot, 20-year-old flight instructor Scott Nelskog from Washington State. The determination was that the residual wake vortex from the 747 pass rolled the Mini Mustang resulting in the fatal crash.
* August 12, 1973: During a four plane formation display a Canadian Forces CF-101 Voodoo entered &#x27;inertial roll coupling&#x27; which overstressed the aircraft leading to a mid-air disintegration into several balls of flames. Both crew members ejected safely through the fireball. No injuries occurred as debris landed in Washington State south of the Abbotsford Airport.
*August 11, 2018: At approximately 5:30 pm, after the show had finished for the day, a recently restored 1930s era De Havilland Dragon Rapide crashed while taking off. The Dragon Rapide was offering rides in the historic aircraft to those who had purchased tickets. It was carrying 4 passengers and a pilot at the time of the incident. The pilot, John Sessions, was seriously injured and required a foot amputation after being airlifted to Royal Columbian Hospital. The other passengers made it out with various injuries that ranged from mild to serious.

== Criticisms ==

The Abbotsford Airshow has been the subject of criticism throughout its history, partially due to the glorification of war as seen through some of the stunts performed and weapons displayed, and partially due to its associated defense trades expo. In 1995, Project Censored listed the Abbotsford Airshow as the 8th most censored news story of the year, largely due to the related arms trading expo. The airshow itself was also often a venue at which international dignitaries could view some of the defense technologies available. The expo component of the airshow ended for several years shortly after, but has continued again as the Aerospace, Defense and Security Expo (ADSE).

<text>The Cunning Little Vixen (original title Příhody lišky Bystroušky or Tales of Vixen Sharp-Ears in English), is a three-act Czech-language opera by Leoš Janáček completed in 1923 to a libretto the composer himself adapted from a novella by Rudolf Těsnohlídek.

==Name==
The opera&#x27;s libretto was adapted by the composer from a 1920 serialized novella, &quot;Liška Bystrouška&quot;, by Rudolf Těsnohlídek, which was first published in the newspaper &quot;Lidové noviny&quot; (with illustrations by Stanislav Lolek). For the title of the opera, &quot;Příhody&quot; means &quot;tales&quot;; &quot;lišky&quot; is the genitive of &quot;vixen&quot;. &quot;Bystroušky&quot;, still genitive, is the pun &quot;sharp&quot;, having the double meaning of &quot;pointed&quot;, like fox ears, and &quot;clever&quot;. The opera first became familiar outside Czechoslovakia in a 1927 German adaptation by Max Brod who provided the new name &quot;Das schlaue Füchslein&quot;, by which Germans still know it and which in English means &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot;.

==Composition==
When Janáček discovered Těsnohlídek&#x27;s comic-strip-inspired story and decided to turn it into an opera, in 1921, he began work by meeting with the author and studying the animals. With this understanding of the characters involved, his own 70 years of life experience, and an undying, unrequited love for the much younger, married Kamila Stösslová, he began work on the opera. He transformed the originally comedic cartoon into a philosophical reflection on the cycle of life by ending with the death of the titular Vixen; as with other operas by elderly composers, this one depicts life leading to a return to simplicity. Work was completed in 1922-23 and the first edition was published the next year in Vienna by Universal Edition. The premiere took place on 6 November 1924 in National Theatre Brno conducted by František Neumann, with Ota Zítek as director and Eduard Milén as stage designer.

The opera incorporates Moravian folk music and rhythms as it recounts the life of a clever (alternative reading: sharp-eared) fox and accompanying wildlife, as well as a few humans, and their small adventures while traversing their lifecycles. Described as a comic opera, it has nonetheless been noted to contain a serious theme. Interpretations of the work remain varied, ranging from children&#x27;s entertainment to tragedy.

==Performance history==
The first non-Czech performance took place in Mainz, Germany, in 1927 in an adaptation by Max Brod under the title &quot;Das schlaue Füchslein&quot;. Brod described the opera as a &quot;dream of the eternity of nature and love-lust&quot;, but his version substantially changed the story-line. It was not successful. In 1956 Walter Felsenstein created a performing version closer to the original, which was successfully performed at the Komische Oper in Berlin. In 1965, Felsenstein made this a Deutscher Fernsehfunk movie with Irmgard Arnold in the title role, but retaining Brod&#x27;s &quot;Das schlaue Füchslein&quot; title.

The opera received its Italian premiere at La Scala in 1958 with Mariella Adani in the title role. 
The work was first staged in England in 1961 by the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera Company (now the English National Opera) with June Bronhill in the title, albeit with a tenor Fox (Kevin Miller); the director was Colin Graham, with conductor Colin Davis, and scenery and costume designs by Barry Kay. A production by David Pountney was mounted by the three UK national companies in the 1980s, first being seen with Scottish Opera at the 1980 Edinburgh Festival, then Welsh National Opera in London the following year and finally with English National Opera in June 1988; nearly 40 years on Pountney supervised a revival by Welsh National Opera in Cardiff and on tour. In 1981, the New York City Opera mounted a production in English based on images created by Maurice Sendak and conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas in his company debut. It starred soprano Gianna Rolandi as Vixen Sharp-Ears and baritone Richard Cross as the Forester. Glyndebourne Festival Opera staged it in 2012, directed by Melly Still, and a revival was included in the Glyndebourne Festival for 2016 with Christopher Purves as the Forester and Elena Tsallagova as the Vixen, conductor Jakub Hrůša and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. In May 2014 the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Franz Welser-Möst, performed an innovative version directed by Yuval Sharon. This production returned the opera to its roots by utilizing animation and hand drawn video sets by the artists Bill Barminski and Christopher Louie of Walter Robot Studios. The production featured the use of hole-in-the-wall carnival cutouts to place the singers&#x27; heads on the animated bodies of the animal characters.

In 2023, the opera was staged in São Paulo, directed by Ira Levin and production by André Heller-Lopes, taking a surrealistic approach.

==Roles==

According to instructions in the score, four pairs of roles may be performed by the same singer: Parson/Badger, Schoolmaster/Mosquito, Forester&#x27;s Wife/Owl, and Rooster/Jay. Janácek later required that Lapák, Rooster, and Chocholka be sung by &quot;girls approximately fifteen years old.&quot;

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===
In the forest, the animals and insects are playing and dancing. The forester enters and lies down against a tree for a nap. A curious vixen cub (often sung by a young girl), inquisitively chases a frog right into the lap of the surprised forester who forcibly takes the vixen home as a pet. Time passes (in the form of an orchestral interlude) and we see the vixen, now grown up into a young adult (and sung by a soprano) tied up in the forester&#x27;s yard with the conservative old dachshund. Fed up with life in confinement, the vixen chews through her rope, attacks the rooster and hen, kills the other chickens, jumps over the fence and runs off to freedom.

===Act 2===
The vixen takes over a badger&#x27;s home and kicks him out. At the inn, the parson, the forester, and the schoolmaster drink and talk about their mutual infatuation with the gypsy girl Terynka. The drunken schoolmaster leaves the inn and mistakes a sunflower behind which the vixen is hiding for Terynka, professing his devotion to her. The forester, also on his way home, sees the vixen and fires two shots at her, sending her running. Later, the vixen, coming into her adulthood, meets a charming boy fox, and they retire to the badger&#x27;s home. An unexpected pregnancy and a forest full of gossipy creatures necessitate their marriage, which rounds out the act.

===Act 3===
The poacher Harašta is engaged to Terynka and is out hunting in preparation for their marriage. He sets a fox trap, which the numerous fox and vixen cubs mock. Harašta, watching from a distance, shoots and kills the vixen, sending her children running. At Harašta&#x27;s wedding, the forester sees the vixen&#x27;s fur, which Harašta gave to Terynka as a wedding present, and flees to the forest to reflect. He returns to the place where he met the vixen, and sits at the tree, grieving the loss of both the vixen and Terynka. His grief grows until, just as in the beginning of the opera, a frog unexpectedly jumps in his lap, the grandson of the one who did so in Act 1. This reassurance of the cycle of death bringing new life gives his heart a deep peace.

==Music==

Apart from &quot;The Excursions of Mr. Brouček&quot;, this is Janáček&#x27;s lightest opera, and, despite the titular vixen&#x27;s death at the end of the work, it stands in contrast to the often brutally serious nature of operas such as &quot;Jenůfa&quot; and &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot;. In &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot;, the composer moved away from the more conversational style of previous and subsequent operas in favor of a more folk-like style, and wove into its fabric some of his most experimental opera concepts (ballet, mime, and orchestral interludes).

Janáček based &quot;The Cunning Little Vixen&quot;″s tonality on modes (similarly to much output during his last decade), expanding the music&#x27;s harmonic range through the utilisation of the seventh and ninth chords. The composition makes frequent use of folk-influenced rhythms and &quot;sčasovka&quot; (personally-coined term for a short motif), while it has been noted to contain similarities to the music of French composer Claude Debussy.

At Janáček&#x27;s request, the final scene from &quot; The Cunning Little Vixen&quot; was performed at his funeral in 1928.

<doc id="1228799" wikidata="Q973105" url="?curid=1228799" title="Islam in Italy">
<text>[[Islam]] is a minority religion in Italy. Muslim presence in Italy dates back to the 9th century, when Sicily came under control of the Aghlabid Dynasty. There was a large Muslim presence in Italy from 827 (the first occupation of Mazara) until the 12th century. The Norman conquest of Sicily led to a gradual decline of Islam, due to the conversions and emigration of Muslims toward Northern Africa. A small Muslim community however survived at least until 1300 (the Muslim settlement of Lucera). By the 1900s, with the Italian colonisation of Libya, Somalia, Eritrea and Albania, a new wave of Muslim migrants, mainly from these countries, entered Italy and remained the most dominant Muslim groups until the end of the 20th century, and often Islamic prayers were conducted in either Arabic, Amharic, Somali or Albanian.

In more recent years, there has been migration from Pakistan, the Balkans (mainly Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina), Bangladesh, India, Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia.

==Legal status==
Islam is not formally recognised by the Italian state. The official recognition of a religion different from Catholicism on behalf of the Italian Government is in fact to be approved by the President of the Republic under request of the Italian Minister of the Interior, following a signed agreement between the proposing religious community and the government. Such recognition does not merely depend on the number of followers of a given religion, and it requires congruence between the proposing religion principles and the Constitution. Official recognition gives an organised religion a chance to benefit from a national &quot;religion tax&quot;, known as the Eight per thousand. Other religions, including Judaism and smaller groups, such as the Assemblies of God, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Seventh-day Adventists, already enjoy the official recognition in the form of signed agreements with the Italian government. In late 2004, Italian minister, Giuseppe Pisanu set out in an attempt to create a unified leadership among the Muslim community. In 2005, the Consulta per l&#x27;Islam Italiano was created. This council is composed of 16 members of the Muslim population that are elected by the Ministry of Interiors. The goal of this council was for the Muslim community to have frequent and harmonious dialogues with the Italian government. The Consulta does not have any real power to make binding decisions. It exists as a platform for the Muslim community. Strong disagreement between Council members slows its work.

==History==
===Saracens===
The Italian island of Pantelleria (which lies between the western tip of Sicily and North Africa) was conquered by the Umayyads in 700. The Arabs had earlier raided Roman Sicily in 652, 667 and 720 A.D.; Syracuse in the eastern end of the island was occupied for the first time temporarily in 708, but a planned invasion in 740 failed due to a rebellion of the Berbers of the Maghreb that lasted until 771 and civil wars in Ifriqiya lasting until 799.

Arab attacks on the island of Sardinia were less significant than those on Sicily and eventually failed to achieve the island&#x27;s conquest, although they induced its separation from the Roman Empire, giving birth to a long period of Sardinian independence, the era of the Judicates.

====Conquest of Sicily====
According to some sources, the conquest was spurred by Euphemius, a Byzantine commander who feared punishment by Emperor Michael II for a sexual indiscretion. After a short-lived conquest of Syracuse, he was proclaimed emperor but was compelled by loyal forces to flee to the court of Ziyadat Allah in Ifriqiya. The latter agreed to conquer Sicily, with the promise to leave it to Euphemius in exchange for a yearly tribute. To end the constant mutinies of his army, the Aghlabid magistrate of Ifriqiya sent Arabian, Berber, and Andalusian rebels to conquer Sicily in 827, 830 and 875, led by, among others, Asad ibn al-Furat. Palermo fell to them in 831, followed by Messina in 843, Syracuse in 878. In 902, the Ifriqiyan magistrate himself led an army against the island, seizing Taormina in 902. Reggio Calabria on the mainland fell in 918, and in 964 Rometta, the last remaining Byzantine toehold on Sicily.

Under the Muslims, agriculture in Sicily prospered and became export oriented. Arts and crafts flourished in the cities. Palermo, the Muslim capital of the island, had 300,000 inhabitants at that time, more than all the cities of Germany combined. The local population conquered by the Muslims were Romanized Catholic Sicilians in Western Sicily and partially Greek speaking Christians, mainly in the eastern half of the island, but there were also a significant number of Jews. These conquered people were afforded freedom of religion under the Muslims as dhimmis. The dhimmi were also required to pay the jizya, or poll tax, and the kharaj or land tax, but were exempt from the tax that Muslims had to pay (Zakaat). The payment of the Jizya is payment for state services and protection against foreign and internal aggression as non-Muslims did not pay the Zakaat tax. The conquered population could instead pay the Zakaat tax by converting to Islam. Large numbers of native Sicilians converted to Islam. However, even after 100 years of Islamic rule, numerous Greek-speaking Christian communities prospered, especially in north-eastern Sicily, as dhimmis. This was largely a result of the Jizya system which allowed co-existence. This co-existence with the conquered population fell apart after the reconquest of Sicily, particularly following the death of King William II of Sicily in 1189. By the mid-11th century, Muslims made up the majority of the population of Sicily.

====Emirates in Apulia====
From Sicily, the Muslims launched raids on the mainland and devastated Calabria. In 835 and again in 837, the Duke of Naples was fighting against the Duke of Benevento and appealed to the Sicilian Muslims for help. In 840 Taranto and Bari fell to the Muslims, and in 841 Brindisi. Muslim attacks on Rome failed in 843, 846 and 849. In 847 Taranto, Bari and Brindisi declared themselves emirates independent from the Aghlabids. For decades the Muslims ruled the Mediterranean and attacked the Italian coastal towns. Muslims occupied Ragusa in Sicily between 868 and 870.

Only after the fall of Malta in 870 did the occidental Christians succeed in setting up an army capable of fighting the Muslims. Over the next two decades, most of the territory held by Muslims on the mainland was liberated from Muslim rule. The Franco-Roman emperor Louis II reconquered Brindisi in 869, Bari in 871 and beat the Arabs at Salerno in 872. The Byzantines retook Taranto in 880. In 882 the Muslims had founded at the mouth of Garigliano between Naples and Rome a new base further in the north, which was in league with Gaeta, and had attacked Campania as well as Sabinia in Lazio. In 915, Pope John X organised a vast alliance of southern powers, including Gaeta and Naples, the Lombard princes and the Byzantines. The subsequent Battle of the Garigliano was successful, and all Saracens were captured and executed, ending any presence of Arabs in Lazio or Campania permanently. A hundred years later, the Byzantines called the Sicilian Muslims to ask for support against a campaign of German emperor Otto II. They beat Otto at the battle of Stilo in 982 and for the next 40 years largely succeeded in preventing his successors from entering southern Italy.

In 1002 a Venetian fleet defeated Muslims besieging Bari. After the Aghlabids were defeated in Ifriqiya as well, Sicily fell in the 10th century to their Fatimid successors, but claimed independence after fights between Sunni and Shia Muslims under the Kalbids.

====Raids in Piedmont====
After they had conquered the Visigoth Kingdom in Spain (729–765), the Arabs and Berbers from Septimania and Narbonne carried out raids into northern Italy, and in 793 again launched an offensive into northwestern Italy (Nicaea 813, 859 and 880). In 888, Andalusian Muslims set up a new base in Fraxinet near Fréjus in French Provence, from where they started raids along the coast and in inner France.

In 915, after the Battle of Garigliano, the Muslims lost their base in southern Lazio. In 926 King Hugh of Italy called the Muslims to fight against his northern Italian rivals. In 934 and 935 Genoa and La Spezia were attacked, followed by Nicaea in 942. In Piedmont the Muslims got as far as Asti and Novi, and also moved northwards along the Rhône valley and the western flank of the Alps. After defeating Burgundian troops , in 942–964 they conquered Savoy and occupied a part of Switzerland (952–960) . To fight the Arabs, Emperor Berengar I, Hugh&#x27;s rival, called the Hungarians, who in their turn devastated northern Italy. As a result of the Muslim defeat at the Battle of Tourtour, Fraxinet was lost and razed by the Christians in 972. Thirty years later, in 1002, Genoa was invaded, and in 1004 Pisa.

Pisa and Genoa joined forces to end Muslim rule over Corsica (Islamic 810/850-930/1020) and Sardinia. In Sardinia in 1015 the fleet of the Andalusian lord of Dénia come from Spain, settled a temporary military camp as a logistic base to control the Tyrrhenian Sea and Italian peninsula, but in 1016 the fleet was forced to leave its base due to the military intervention of maritime republics of Genoa and Pisa.

====Sicily under the Normans====

The cultural and economical bloom in Sicily that had started under the Kalbids was interrupted by internecine fights, followed by invasions by the Tunisian Zirids (1027), Pisa (1030–1035), and the Romans (1027 onwards). Eastern Sicily (Messina, Syracuse and Taormina) was captured by the Byzantines in 1038–1042. In 1059 Normans from southern Italy, led by Roger I, invaded the island. The Normans conquered Reggio in 1060 (conquered by the Romanin 1027). Messina fell to the Normans in 1061; an invasion by the Algerian Hammadids to preserve Islamic rule was thwarted in 1063 by the fleets of Genoa and Pisa. The loss of Palermo in 1072 and of Syracuse in 1088 could not be prevented. Noto and the last Muslim strongholds on Sicily fell in 1091. In 1090–91, the Normans also conquered Malta; Pantelleria fell in 1123.

A small Muslim population remained on Sicily under the Normans. Roger II hosted at his court, among others, the famous geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi and the poet Muhammad ibn Zafar. At first, Muslims were tolerated by the Normans, but soon pressure from the Popes led to their increasing discrimination; most mosques were destroyed or made into churches. The first Sicilian Normans did not take part in the Crusades, but they undertook a number of invasions and raids in Ifriqiya, before they were defeated thereafter 1157 by the Almohads.

This peaceful coexistence in Sicily finally ended with the death of King William II in 1189. The Muslim elite emigrated at that time. Their medical knowledge was preserved in the Schola Medica Salernitana; an Arabian-Roman-Norman synthesis in art and architecture survived as Sicilian Romanesque. The remaining Muslims fled, for example to Caltagirone on Sicily, or hid out in the mountains and continued to resist against the Hohenstaufen dynasty, who ruled the island from 1194 on. In the heartland of the island, the Muslims declared Ibn Abbad the last Emir of Sicily.

To end this upheaval, emperor Frederick II, himself a Crusader, instigated a policy to rid Sicily of the few remaining Muslims. This cleansing was done in small part under Papal influence but mostly to create a loyal force of troops which could not be influenced by non-Christian infiltrators. In 1224–1239 he deported every single Muslim from Sicily to an autonomous colony under strict military control (so that they could not infiltrate non-Muslim areas) in Lucera in Apulia. Muslims were recruited however by Frederick in the army and constituted his faithful personal bodyguard, since they had no connection to his political rivals. In 1249, he ejected the Muslims from Malta as well. Lucera was returned to the Christians in 1300 at the instigation of the pope by King Charles II of Naples. Muslims were forcefully converted, killed or expelled from Europe . However a Muslim community was still recorded in Apulia in 1336 and very recently in 2009, a genetic study revealed a small genetic Northwest African contribution among today&#x27;s inhabitants near the region of Lucera.

=== During Spanish rule of Sicily ===
During Spanish rule of Sicily, and to escape the Spanish inquisition of the Moriscos (Muslims who had converted to Christianity) in the Iberian peninsula, a few Moriscos migrated to Sicily. During this time there were several attempts to rid Sicily of its extensive formerly Muslim &#x27;Moor&#x27; population. The attacks were also directed against crypto-Muslim slaves and Sicilian renegades who refused to deny Islam during the 16th and the 17th centuries. However, it is doubtful that the order was carried out in practice. The main reason that some former Muslims were able to remain in Sicily was that they were openly supported by The Duke of Osuna, now officially installed as viceroy in Palermo, advocated to the Spanish monarch in Madrid for allowing the Moriscos to stay in Sicily.

===15th century: Ottomans in Otranto===
During this century, the Ottoman Empire was expanding mightily in southeastern Europe. It completed the absorption of the Byzantine Empire in 1453 under Sultan Mehmet II by conquering Constantinople and Galata. It seized Genoa&#x27;s last bastions in the Black Sea in 1475 and Venice&#x27;s Greek colony of Euboea in 1479. Turkish troops invaded the Friuli region in northeastern Italy in 1479 and again in 1499–1503. The Apulian harbor town of Otranto, located about 100 kilometers southeast of Brindisi, was seized in 1480 (Ottoman invasion of Otranto), but the Turks were routed there in 1481 by an alliance of several Italian city-states, Hungary and France led by the prince Alphonso II of Naples, when Mehmet died and a war for his succession broke out. Cem Sultan, pretender to the Ottoman throne, was defeated despite being supported by the pope; he fled with his family to the Kingdom of Naples, where his male descendants were bestowed with the title of Principe de Sayd by the Pope in 1492. They lived in Naples until the 17th century and in Sicily until 1668 before relocating to Malta.

====Attacks in the 16th century====
It is a subject of debate whether Otranto was meant to be the base for further conquests. In any case, the Ottoman sultans had not given up their ambition to take over the Italian Peninsula and to finally install Islamic sovereignty after the conquest of Constantinople. After the conquests of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) and Hungary in 1526 and the defeat of the Turkish army at Vienna in 1529, Turkish fleets again attacked southern Italy. Reggio was sacked in 1512 by the famous Turkish corsair Khayr al-Din, better known by the nickname of Barbarossa; in 1526 the Turks attacked Reggio again, but this time suffered a setback and were forced to turn their sights elsewhere. In 1538 they defeated the Venetian fleet. In 1539 Nice was raided by the Barbary pirates (Siege of Nice), but an attempted Turkish landing on Sicily failed, as did the attempted conquest of Pantelleria in 1553 and the siege of Malta in 1565.

Next to Spain, the biggest contribution to the victory of the Christian &quot;Holy League&quot; in the battle of Lepanto in 1571 was made by the Republic of Venice, which between 1423 and 1718 fought eight costly wars against the Ottoman Empire. In 1594, the city of Reggio was again sacked by Cığalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha, a renegade who converted to Islam.

===Imperial Italian era===
By the 19th century, Italy had finally reunified the country and engaged in a process of colonialism. Italy would conquer territories like Albania, Libya, Somalia and Eritrea; the majority of these colonies had predominantly Muslim population. This also resulted in a new wave of migration of the Muslim population to Italy, mainly from the Albanian Muslim communities due to proximity.

In 1937, Benito Mussolini proclaimed himself as the Protector of Islam and held the ceremonial Sword of Islam as an attempt to demonstrate his support for the Muslim population. During the World War II, Italy recruited Muslim soldiers from their colonies in Somalia, Libya and Eritrea to fight against the British and American forces, as well as supporting various fascist groups, notably the Albanian Fascist Militia and the Cham Albanians, majority of them were Muslims. Most of these Albanian Muslims were expelled by Greece after the WW2 ended, with some of them escaped to Italy instead of returning to Communist Albania.

==Present day==

According to a 2016 Pew Research Center projection and Brookings, there are 1,400,000 Muslims in Italy (2.3% of the Italian population), almost one third of Italy&#x27;s foreign population (250.000 have acquired Italian citizenship). The majority of Muslims in Italy are Sunni, with a Shi&#x27;ite minority. There are also a few Ahmadi Muslims in the country. This diversity has induced a lack of organization throughout the Italian Muslim community. As a result, the community also lacks cohesive leadership.

Despite undocumented immigrants representing a minority of the Muslims in Italy, considering that undocumented migrants and refugees predominantly come from Muslim countries, the issue of Islam in contemporary Italy has been linked by some political parties (particularly the Lega Nord) with immigration, and more specifically illegal immigration. Immigration has become a prominent political issue, as reports of boatloads of illegal immigrants (or &quot;clandestini&quot;) dominate news programmes, especially in the summertime. Police forces have not had great success in intercepting many of the thousands of &quot;clandestini&quot; who land on Italian beaches, mainly because of a political unwillingness, partly fostered by the EU, to address the issue. However, the vast majority of the &quot;clandestini&quot; landing in Italy are only using the country as a gateway to other EU states, due to the fact that Italy offers fewer economic opportunities and social welfare services for them than Germany, France, or the United Kingdom.

While in medieval times, the Muslim population was almost totally concentrated in Insular Sicily and in the city of Lucera, in Apulia, it is today more evenly distributed, with almost 60% of Muslims living in the North of Italy, 25% in the centre, and only 15% in the South. Muslims form a lower proportion of immigrants than in previous years, as the latest statistical reports by the Italian Ministry of Interior and Caritas indicate that the share of Muslims among new immigrants has declined from over 50% at the beginning of the 1990s (mainly Albanians and Moroccans) to less than 25% in the following decade, due to the massive arrivals from eastern Europe.

Recent points of contention between ethnic Italians and the Muslim immigrant population include the strong presence of crucifixes in public buildings, including school classrooms, government offices, and hospital wards. Adel Smith has attracted considerable media attention by demanding that crucifixes in public facilities be removed. The Italian Council of State, in the Sentence No. 556, 13 February 2006, confirmed the display of the crucifix in government sponsored spaces. Smith was subsequently charged with defaming the Catholic religion in 2006.

In November 2016, Minister of the Interior Angelino Alfano reported that Italy had deported nine imams for inciting racial violence.

In January 2017, community groups representing around 70% of the Muslim community in Italy signed a pact with the government to &quot;reject all forms of violence and terrorism&quot; and to hold prayers in mosques in the Italian language or at least to have them translated.

== Conversion to Islam ==
The conversion of Italians to Islam has been rising since the year 2000. According to the Union of Islamic Communities in Italy (Ucoi), approximately 70,000 Italians have embraced Islam during this period.

===By ethnicities and nationalities===
Currently, Moroccans form the largest Muslim population, while Albanians form the second largest Muslim community in Italy. The Albanians are also the oldest living Muslim community in Italy as well, and have an official representative, the Union of Albanian Muslims in Italy (&quot;Unione degli Albanesi Musulmani in Italia&quot;).

=== Muslim prison population in Italy ===
As of 2013, of the total 64,760 detainees in Italy, approximately 13,500 (20.8%) came from countries with Islamic majorities, mostly Morocco and Tunisia.

===Mosques===

There are a total of eight mosques in Italy. While Italy is home to the fourth largest Muslim population in Europe, the number of mosques is minute in comparison to France (which is home to over 2,200 mosques) and the United Kingdom (which is home to over 1,500 mosques). The scarcity of mosques in Italy is caused predominantly by the fact that Italy does not officially recognize Islam as a religion. Official state recognition would guarantee and protect places of worship, recognize religious holidays and allow access to public funding.

There have been a number of cases of extraordinary rendition of Muslim activists, as well as attempts by a past government to close mosques. Many mosque constructions are blocked by opposition of local residents. In September 2008 the Lega Nord political party was reported to have introduced a new bill which would have blocked the construction of new mosques in much of the country, arguing that Muslims can pray anywhere, and do not need a mosque. The construction of mosques had already been blocked in Milan. The bill was not approved.

=== Extremism ===
In 2007, the Moroccan imam at the mosque in Ponte Felcino in Perugia was deported by the Italian government for extremist views.

Deportation (expulsion) of foreign suspects have been the cornerstone of Italy&#x27;s preventive counter-terrorism fight against suspected radicals. Every deportee is prohibited from re-entering Italy and therefore the entire Schengen Area, for a period of five years. Italy is able to use this method as many radicalized Muslims are first-generation immigrants and therefore have not yet acquired Italian citizenship. In Italy as elsewhere in Europe, prison inmates show signs of radicalization while incarcerated and in 2018, 41 individuals were deported upon release from prison. Of the 147 deported by the Italian government in the 2015–2017 all were related to jihadism and 12 were imams. From January 2015 to April 2018, 300 individuals were expulsed from Italian soil. The vast majority of the deportees come from North Africa and a smaller group come from the Balkans.

In the mid to late 2010s, a &quot;homegrown&quot; Islamist movement started to emerge in Italy with Islamists writing online content in Italian. While radicalized individuals may get in contact with fellow extremists at mosques, indoctrination and planning of violence take place elsewhere.

From 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2017, a total of eight imams were deported. The following twelve-month period, two were deported.

In July 2016, the Moroccan imam at the &quot;Asonna&quot; center in Noventa Vicentina was deported for reportedly expressing extremist views and for posing a security threat. While most extremists are banned for 5 to 10 years, Muhammed Madad was banned from returning for 15 years.

In March 2018, police carried out an anti-terrorist operation in Foggia against the &quot;Al Dawa&quot; unauthorized prayer hall located near the railway station. Egyptian Abdel Rahman Mohy preached to children using Islamic State propaganda.

According to prison authorities in Italy, in October 2018 there were 66 Muslim detainees who either had been sentenced or were awaiting trial for terrorism offences.

=== Islamophobia ===

Although Muslim population in Italy is very small compared to its counterparts in France, Germany, Britain and Spain, anti-Islamic feeling in Italy runs high, which became clear following the September 11 attacks and 7 July 2005 London bombings. Survey published in 2019 by the Pew Research Center found that 55% of Italians had an unfavourable view of Muslims. Much of the local Italian media correlates Islam to terrorism as a whole. This contributes to these unfavorable opinions.

=== Acts of violence against Islamic places of worship ===
In recent years there have been some acts of violence against Islamic places of worship in Italy:

* On 24 April 1994, a Molotov cocktail caused a fire at the small mosque in albenga&#x27;s old
* Anti-Islamic attacks following the September 2001 bombings in Sicily and Southern Italy 
* On 24 January 2004, a rock thrown from a car broke through the window of the entrance to the Mosque of Segrate,
* In April 2004, the Mosque of Mercy in Savona was the subject of discriminatory spray writing on the door, including a swastika.
* On the night of 3–4 August 2010, an arson attack was carried out in the offices of the Luce mosque in Bologna by unknown persons who entered it by cutting through the fences with a shear. The act has been condemned by the Jewish community in Bologna and by various political forces.

==Organizations==
A minority of Italian Muslims belong to religious associations, the best known of which are:

* UCOII Unione delle Comunità Islamiche d&#x27;Italia (Union of the Islamic Communities and Organizations of Italy)
** Since its founding, the union has been active in the political scene, recently attempting to become the primary Islamic liaison.
* CICI, Centro Islamico Culturale d&#x27;Italia, which has its seat in the Mosque of Rome, which is reputed to be the largest mosque in Europe
* COREIS, Comunità Religiosa Islamica Italiana, which has its seat in Milan, but also a branch in Rome.
*USMI, Union of Muslim Students in Italy 
**Founded in the 1970s in Perugia and composed mostly of Jordanian, Syrian and Palestine students, the group&#x27;s ideology is quite similar to the Muslim Brotherhood, the transnational Islamic movement in Egypt in the 1920s.

<text>A frock coat is a formal men&#x27;s coat characterised by a knee-length skirt cut all around the base just above the knee, popular during the Victorian and Edwardian periods (1830s–1910s). It is a fitted, long-sleeved coat with a centre vent at the back and some features unusual in post-Victorian dress. These include the reverse collar and lapels, where the outer edge of the lapel is often cut from a separate piece of cloth from the main body and also a high degree of waist suppression around the waistcoat, where the coat&#x27;s diameter round the waist is less than round the chest. This is achieved by a high horizontal waist seam with side bodies, which are extra panels of fabric above the waist used to pull in the naturally cylindrical drape. As was usual with all coats in the 19th century, shoulder padding was rare or minimal.

In the Age of Revolution around the end of the 18th century, men abandoned the justaucorps with tricorne hats for the directoire style: dress coat with breeches or increasingly pantaloons, and top hats. However, by the 1820s, the frock coat was introduced along with full-length trousers (pants), perhaps inspired by the then casual country leisure wear frock. Early frock coats inherited the higher collars and voluminous lapels of the dress coat style at the time, and were sometimes offered in different, albeit increasingly dark, colours. Within its first next few years, though, plain black soon became the only established practice, and with a moderate collar. The top hat followed suit.

Although black trousers did occur, especially at daytime, the black frock coat was commonly worn with charcoal grey, pin-striped or checked formal trousers. The single-breasted frock coat sporting the notched (step) lapel was more associated with day-to-day professional informal wear. Yet, from the end of the 19th century, with the gradual introduction of the lounge suit, the frock coat came to embody the most formal wear for daytime. Especially so when double-breasted with peaked lapels, a style sometimes called a &quot;Prince Albert&quot; after Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria. The formal frock coat only buttoned down to the waist seam, which was decorated at the back with a pair of buttons. The cassock, a coat that is buttoned up to the neck, forming a high, stand-up Roman style collar for clergymen, was harmonized to the style of the contemporary frock coat.

By the late 19th century, the knee-length dress coat, morning coat and shorter cut lounge suit were all standardized. While the dress coat and the morning coat are knee-length coats like the frock coat and traditionally share the waist seam of the precursor, they are distinguished by the cutaway of the skirt which gives dress coats and morning coats tails at the back. From the 1920s, the frock coat was increasingly replaced as day formal wear by the cut-away morning coat. In 1936, it was suspended from the protocol of audiences at the British royal court. While effectively relegated to a rarity in formal wear ever since, it does occur in certain formal marriages and traditional processions.

==Name==
The name frock coat appeared out from the earlier frock.

Earlier terminology also used &quot;redingote&quot; (or redingotte, redingot), derived from a French alteration of the English &quot;riding coat&quot;, an example of re-borrowing.

==History==

Frock coats emerged during the Napoleonic Wars, where they were worn by officers in the Austrian and various German armies during campaign. They efficiently kept the wearer warm as well as protecting his uniform. Privates and non-commissioned officers would wear greatcoats on campaign.

===The earlier &quot;frock&quot;===
During the mid seventeenth century the older doublets, ruffs, paned hose and jerkins were replaced by the precursor to the three piece suit comprising waistcoat, tight breeches and a long coat called a justacorps, topped by a powdered wig and tricorne hat. This coat, popularized by Louis XIII of France and Charles II of England, was knee length and looser fitting than the later frock coat, with turn-back cuffs and two rows of buttons. English and French noblemen often wore expensive brocade coats decorated with velvet, gold braid, embroidery and gold buttons to demonstrate their wealth.

Before the frock coat existed, there was another garment called the &quot;frock&quot; in the 18th century, which was probably unrelated to the frock &quot;coat&quot;, sharing only a similarity in name. The earlier frock was originally country clothing that increasingly became common around 1730. Formal dress was then so elaborate that it was impractical for everyday wear, so the frock became fashionable as half dress, a less formal alternative. By the 1780s the frock was worn widely as town wear and, towards the end of the 18th century, started to be made with a single-breasted cut away front and tails. It was thus the precursor to the modern dress coat worn with white tie dress code.

These relations can be seen in similar foreign terms. The modern word for a dress coat in Italian, French, Romanian and Spanish is &quot;frac&quot;; in German and Scandinavian languages &quot;Frack&quot;; and Portuguese &quot;fraque&quot;, used in the late 18th century to describe a garment very similar to the frock, being a single or double-breasted garment with a diagonally cutaway front in the manner of a modern morning coat. Even coats with horizontally cut away skirts like a dress coat were referred to as a &quot;frock&quot; in the late eighteenth and very early 19th century, before being renamed to &quot;dress coat&quot;.

This suggests that the earlier frock from the 18th century is more the direct ancestor of the modern dress coat, whereas the frock &quot;coat&quot; in the 19th century, the subject under discussion here, is a different garment altogether with separate military origins in the 19th century. However a remote historical connection to the frock cannot entirely be excluded, as is the case with similar looks variably referred to as redingote or riding coat.

Other meanings of the term &quot;frock&quot; include clerical garb and a type of woman&#x27;s dress combining a skirt with a shirt–blouse top.

===Military uniforms===
The first military frock coats were issued late in the Napoleonic Wars to French line infantry and Prussian Landwehr troops. Unwilling to soil the expensive tail coats on campaign, the French adopted a loose fitting single-breasted coat with contrasting collar and cuffs. The Germans, having been devastated by years of war, were unable to afford elaborate uniforms like the British line infantry and chose a peaked cap and double-breasted blue coat, again with contrasting collar and cuffs, as these were cheaper to produce for the large numbers of recruits, smart enough for full dress and more practical for campaigns.

By the 1840s, frock coats were regulation for the American, Prussian, Russian and French armies. By 1834 officers of the British Army had adopted a dark blue/black frock coat for ordinary duties, derived from an earlier greatcoat worn during the Napoleonic period. US army officers were first issued navy blue frocks during the Mexican War, with gold epaulettes and peaked caps of the German pattern. Enlisted USMC personnel received a double breasted version with red piping worn with a leather stock and shako to reflect their status as an elite unit. Infantry soldiers continued to be issued the 1833 pattern shell jacket until the M1858 uniform complete with French style kepi entered service shortly before the US Civil War.
===The earlier &quot;redingote&quot;===

The men&#x27;s &quot;redingote&quot; was an eighteenth-century or early-nineteenth-century long coat or greatcoat, derived from the country garment (i.e. derived from &quot;riding coat&quot;) with a wide, flat collar called a &quot;frock&quot;. In French and several other languages, &quot;redingote&quot; is the usual term for a fitted frock coat. The form a men&#x27;s redingote took could be of the tightly fitting frock coat style or the more voluminous, loose &quot;great coat&quot; style, replete with overlapping capes or collars, such as a &quot;garrick&quot; redingote, depending on fashion throughout its popularity.

During the 19th century the term &quot;redingote&quot; also applied to a military riding coat worn mainly by French cavalrymen. This took the form of a greatcoat with long skirts, extending over the sides of the horse being ridden.

===The origins and rise of the frock coat===

When the frock coat was first worn, correct daytime full dress was a dress coat. The frock coat began as a form of undress, the clothing worn instead of the dress coat in more informal situations. The coat itself was possibly of military origin. Towards the end of the 1820s, it started to be cut with a waist seam to make it more fitted, with an often marked waist suppression and exaggerated flair of the skirt. This hour-glass figure persisted into the 1840s. As the frock coat became more widely established around the 1850s, it started to become accepted as formal day time full dress, thus relegating the dress coat exclusively to evening full dress, where it remains today as a component of white tie. At this period, the frock coat became the most standard form of coat for formal day time dress. Through most of the Victorian era it continued to be worn in similar situations those in which the lounge suit is worn today such as in weddings, funerals and by professionals. It was the standard business attire of the Victorian era.

Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria, is usually credited with popularizing the frock coat and even gave a synonym for its double-breasted version, a &quot;Prince Albert&quot;. During the Victorian era, the frock coat rapidly became worn universally in Britain, Europe and America as standard formal business dress or for formal daytime events. It was considered the most correct form of morning dress for the time.

Notably, however, this time was before contemporary established dress code terminology and so definitions of formal attire, as well as morning and evening attire, were not altogether according to later standards.

===The decline of the frock coat===
Around the 1880s and increasingly through into the Edwardian era, an adaptation of the riding coat called a Newmarket coat, that rapidly and ever since became known as a morning coat, began to supplant the frock coat as daytime full dress. Once considered a casual equestrian sports coat, the morning coat slowly started to become both acceptable and increasingly popular, as a standard day-time town full dress alternative to the frock coat, a position which the morning coat enjoys to this day.

The morning coat was particularly popular among fashionable younger men and the frock coat increasingly came to be worn mostly by older conservative gentlemen. The morning coat gradually relegated the frock coat only to more formal situations, to the point that the frock coat eventually came to be worn only as court and diplomatic dress.

The lounge suit was once only worn as smart leisure wear in the country or at the seaside but in the middle of the 19th century started to rise rapidly in popularity. It took on the role of a more casual alternative to the morning coat for town wear, moving the latter up in the scale of formality. The more the morning coat became fashionable as correct daytime full dress, the more the lounge suit became acceptable as an informal alternative. Finally the frock coat became relegated to the status of ultra-formal day wear, worn only by older men. At the most formal events during the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, heads of government wore the frock coat but at more informal meetings they wore morning coats or even a lounge suit. In 1926, George V hastened the demise of the frock coat when he shocked the public by appearing at the opening of the Chelsea Flower Show wearing a morning coat. The frock coat barely survived the 1930s only as an ultra-formal form of court dress, until being finally officially abolished in 1936 as official court dress by Edward VIII (who later abdicated to become the Duke of Windsor). It was replaced by the morning coat, thus consigning the frock coat protocol-wise to the status of historic dress at the British royal court.

Since that time it has been worn sparingly, albeit arguably not altogether vanished (see section on contemporary use further below).

==Composition==

===Formal wear===

Frock coats worn with waistcoat and formal striped trousers are still very occasionally worn as daytime formal wear, especially to weddings, as an alternative to morning coats, in order to give the wedding attire a Victorian flavour. They are today usually only worn by the wedding party, where elements of historical costume are more acceptable and even this practice is unusual, as its role as a formal ceremonial coat in daytime formal wear has been long supplanted in modern dress code by the morning coat. Like morning coats, frock coats are only worn for daytime formal events before 5pm. and no later than until around 7pm.

Prior to the establishment of morning dress around the turn of the century in 1900, the expression &quot;morning dress&quot; tended to refer to frock coat, while gradually extending to mean both the frock coat and &quot;morning dress&quot; in the contemporary sense.

====Cloth====

Standard fibres used for the frock coat included wool and vicuña. The most common weaves were known as broadcloth and duffel, both so called &quot;heavy wools&quot; manufactured along a process originating from Flanders in the 11th century (Flemish cloth). The standard colour of a civilian frock coat was solid black but later, in the Victorian era, charcoal grey became an acceptable but less common alternative and Midnight Blue was an even rarer alternative colour. For business and festive occasions the revers was lined with black silk facings (either satin or grosgrain). For funerals black frock coats without self-faced revers were worn with a matching black waistcoat. In military uniforms a wider variety of colours was and is common, prompting such colour names as &quot;navy blue&quot; and &quot;cadet grey&quot;.

On more formal outings the coat was worn with a pair of cashmere striped morning trousers (&quot;cashmere stripes&quot; refers to the muted design in black, silver and charcoal grey, not the fibres of the cloth). However, trousers of muted checks were also worn in slightly more informal situations. In keeping with the rules set for morning dress, trousers matching the coat were considered a somewhat less formal alternative.

A matching black waistcoat was worn for more formal business or more solemn ceremonies. During the earlier Victorian period, colourful fancy waistcoats of silk were noted as being worn by gentlemen such as Charles Dickens. In summer a white or buff coloured linen waistcoat could be worn. For festive occasions a lighter coloured waistcoat such as light grey was permissible.

====Cut====
The length of the skirt of the frock coat varied during the Victorian era and Edwardian era according to fashion. The most conservative length became established as being to the knees but fashion conscious men would follow the latest trends to wear them either longer or shorter. Similarly, the height of the waist – the point of maximal waist suppression – changed according to fashion. During its heyday, the frock coat was cut following the 19th century ideal of flattering the natural elegance of the naked figure, based on the ideals of Neoclassicism that admired the depiction of the idealised nude in Classical Greco-Roman sculpture. The elegance of the form of the frock coat derived from its hourglass shape with a closely cut waist which at times around the 1830s-40&#x27;s was reinforced further with padding to round out the chest. A cut with an ideal hourglass silhouette was achievable because coats during this era were all made bespoke, individually cut to the exact measurements of the customer. The 19th century aesthetics of tailoring contrasted markedly to the modern style of cutting suits which involves a greater degree of drape (fullness), as established by the great early 20th century Savile Row tailor Frederick Scholte. Caution needs to be exercised by modern tailors trained to create the drape cut style of modern lounge suits to minimise drape – particularly around the waist – when cutting a historically accurate frock coat. Sometimes, modern lounge suit coats with an unusually long skirt are referred to by ready-to-wear makers as a &#x27;frock coat&#x27; but these lack the waist seam, resulting in the fuller drape more typical of a modern overcoat or a lounge suit jacket. The silhouette of the historically accurate frock coat has the waist seam precisely tailored to permit the classical and elongating hourglass figure with the strong waist suppression.

====Details====

Another characteristic of frock coats was their lack of any outer pockets. Only late in the Victorian and Edwardian era were they ever made with a chest pocket to sport a pocket square, a feature more typical of the modern lounge suit. Oscar Wilde, a famous dandy of his time, was often seen in portraits wearing just such a model but this was rather rare on frock coats; while in keeping with the flamboyant nature of Wilde&#x27;s dress, it was frowned upon by traditionalists. Side pockets were always absent from frock coats but pockets were provided on the inside of the chest or inside the top part of the tail.

The buttons on a frock coat were always covered in cloth, often to match the silk on the revers, showing in the triangle of lining wrapped over the inside of the lapels. Another common feature was the use of fancy buttons with a snow-flake or check pattern woven over it.

Through most of the Victorian era until towards the end, the lapels were cut separately and sewn on later, apparently because it made the lapel roll more elegantly from bottom up. The lapel revers from the inside of the coat wrapped over to the front, creating a small triangle of silk, while the outer half was cut from two strips of the body fabric. This was a feature of double-breasted frock coats used on all such coats but morning and dress coats, which had previously followed this practice, began to be made with attached lapels (wholecut) around the end of the Edwardian era. Through the Victorian era, a row of decorative button holes was created down the lapel edge but by Edwardian period these were reduced down to just the one lapel boutonnière button hole.

Turn back cuffs on the sleeves, similar to the turn ups (cuffs in American English) on modern trouser hems, were standard, with two buttons on the cuff.

Another rare feature was the use of decorative braiding around the sleeve cuffs and lapel edges.

====Accessories====
Proper accessories to wear with the frock coat included a non-collapsible top hat and a boutonnière in the lapel. A Homburg hat was considered too informal to wear with proper formal morning dress. During the Victorian and Edwardian era, button boots with a single row of punching across the cap toe were worn along with a cane. On cold days, it was common to wear a frock overcoat, a type of overcoat cut exactly the same as the frock coat, with the waist seam construction only a little longer and fuller to permit it to be worn over the top of the frock coat. Patent leather dress boots were worn up until the Edwardian era with morning dress. The practice of wearing patent leather shoes is today reserved strictly for evening formalwear. Trousers are uncuffed and worn with braces to avoid the top of the trousers from showing underneath the waistcoat. Only white shirts were worn with frock coats. The shirt was worn with a standing detachable collar with either wingtips or &quot;imperial&quot; style (plain standing). The most standard neckwear was a formal cravat . The cravat was tied in the Ascot knot characterised by way the ends cross over in front or alternatively in a Ruche knot, tied like a four-in-hand knot of a modern necktie. A decorative cravat pin often adorned with a precious stone or pearl was used to keep the cravat tidy. The cravat was usual with a frock coat when worn in more formal occasions through the Victorian and Edwardian eras, although the long necktie came to be worn increasingly after the turn of the century in the same manner as it is today with morning dress. The practice of wearing bow ties as an acceptable alternative with formalwear fell away after the late Victorian to early Edwardian era and became relegated to eveningwear, as remains the case in the 21st century. As with a formal shirt for white tie, cuffs were single (rather than double) cuffed and made to close with cufflinks. The waistcoat was usually double-breasted with peaked lapels. Formal gloves in light grey suede, chamois or kid leather were also required.

===Informal frock coat suits===

The solid black garment described above was widely used but before the lounge suit became popular, there was a need for a more informal garment for smart casual wear. A version of the frock coat was used here too, with matching trousers and a more informal cloth, featuring stripes or the check shown in the plate opposite. The waistcoat, instead of being black as usual in the formal version, was matching or odd. Until the modern cut away morning coat was worn, the single breasted frock coat was called a morning coat and was used in such a less formal context and double breasted coats made this way would often not fasten, being held loosely together in much the same way the modern morning coat is, with a single link.

The accessories for the two styles depended on the intended use of the coat: for more formal settings, the outfit might still have striped trousers and demand a top hat and white gloves; for business, by the turn of the century, the morning coat was used (again, this referred to a single breasted frock coat then, not the modern morning coat). This last was accompanied by a business collar (such as winged collar, not a standing Imperial collar); a four in hand tie (as opposed to the formal cravat and puff) and a soft Derby or Homburg.

==Modern use==
===General===
Although ceasing to be required by protocol as formal attire at the British royal court in 1936, at the order of the short-reigning King Edward VIII, the frock coat has not altogether vanished as modern civilian formal wear.

The state funeral of Winston Churchill in 1965 included wearers of frock coats.

Savile Row tailor and reinnovator Tommy Nutter (1943– 1992) was a frequent wearer.

Frock coats, albeit often in other colours than black, survive until this day in the livery of hotel staff.

King Tupou VI of Tonga (born 1959) is a frequent wearer of frock coats.

Examples of frock coats in fashion in the 21st century include Alexander McQueen in 2012, Prada&#x27;s autumn edition in 2012, and Paul Smith in 2018.

Frock coats still appear in certain traditional Catholic processions, such as the Blutritt in Germany.

Some wedding grooms apply more or less creative civil or military variants of frock coats. In the civilian wear cases it is sometimes accompanied by the same creativity in terms of ascot ties. As a prominent example, when Prince Harry married Meghan Markle in 2018, he and his brother and best man Prince William opted for military full dress uniform variants of frock coats. 

===Military uniforms===

The cut of a frock coat with a waist seam flatters a man&#x27;s figure, as opposed to a sack coat, and such frock coats remained part of some 21st-century military uniforms. They can either be single-breasted, as in some army uniforms, or double-breasted as in both army and navy uniforms. An example of the latter is seen in the modern gala dress of officers in the Spanish Navy. The British Army currently retains the frock coat for ceremonial wear by senior officers of Lieutenant-General rank and above, by officers of the Household Division, by some bandmasters and by holders of certain Royal appointments.

The 19th century Polish frock coat with hood and toggle-and-tow fastenings stood model for the overcoat used by the Royal Navy and British Army from 1890 on, known as Duffel coat or Monty coat.

===Orthodox Jewish wear===
In the Lithuanian yeshiva world, many prominent figures wear a black frock coat also known as a kapotteh (accompanied by either a Homburg or fedora hat) as formal wear. In recent years many Sefardi rabbis also wear a similar frock coat. The frock coat amongst non-Hassidic Jews is usually reserved for a rosh yeshiva, (maybe also the mashgiach and other senior rabbis of the yeshiva) and other rabbis such as important communal rabbis and some chief rabbis.

Most married male Lubavitcher Hasidim also don frock coats on Shabbat. All Hasidim also wear a gartel (belt) over their outer coats during prayer services.

Most Hasidim wear long coats called rekelekh during the week, which are often mistaken for frock coats but are really very long suit jackets. On Shabbat, Hasidim wear bekishes, which are usually silk or polyester as opposed to the woollen frock coat. The bekishe and the rekel both lack the waist seam construction of the frock coat. Additionally, bekishes can be distinguished from frock coats by the additional two buttons on front and a lack of a slit in the back.

Part of the slit hem in the back of the frock coat is rounded so as to not require tzitzit. The buttons are usually made to go right over left on most Jewish frock coats, particularly those worn by Hasidic Jews.

In Yiddish, a frock coat is known as a &quot;frak&quot;, a &quot;sirtuk&quot; or a &quot;kapotteh&quot;.

===Teddy Boys===
The Teddy Boys, a 1950s UK youth movement, named for their use of Edwardian-inspired clothing, briefly revived the frock coat, which they often referred to as a &quot;drape&quot;.

<text>The Norway Scholarship is a scholarship to the University of Oxford that is awarded in Norway. Norway Scholars receive funding for one or two years of study and research at Oxford University, and the scholar always becomes a member of Wadham College.

The first Norway Scholarship was awarded in 1920. Since then, one Norway Scholar has been selected annually, except for a few periods, such as during the Second World War. The scholarship is highly competitive, and is awarded to a current student, or recent graduate of Oslo University. Past Norway Scholars have included Nordahl Grieg, Peter A. Munch and Harald Sverdrup.


==History==
The idea for a scholarship fund enabling students from Royal Frederik University, (now University of Oslo) to study for one year at Wadham College in Oxford was conceived in 1919 by a young alumnus of the college, who during the war years 1914–18 had held the post of British vice-consul at Kristiansund in Møre og Romsdal, Norway. Arthur Ivor Garland Jayne (1882-1958) was a son of Francis Jayne (1845–1921) Lord Bishop of Chester. Arthur Jayne had married Fredrikke Marie Cathrine von Munthe af Morgenstierne, daughter of Professor Bredo Henrik von Munthe af Morgenstierne (1851–1930), Rector of the University of Oslo (1912–1918). As with famous Polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen, he gave NOK 5000.- towards the establishment of a Norwegian Oxford Scholarship Fund. Altogether Jayne succeeded in raising NOK. 60 000.- or approximately GBP 2780. Jayne spent his later life as a lecturer in English at the University of Oslo.

Arthur Jayne retrospectively explained his initiative in a letter dated 14. October 1945 to Professor Didrik Arup Seip (1884–1963), then Rector of Oslo University, in the following words:

&quot;At the time of the first world war – - – a considerable amount of ‘Allied’ propaganda material, sent to Norway and intended to inform Norwegian opinion about the war, proved ill-adapted to enlist the understanding sympathy of those who had previously had cultural or business contacts with the nations in conflict with the Allies. The experience seemed to indicate the great importance of any educational facilities which would bring the youth of Norway and Britain into really close association with each other. It struck me that one useful step in that direction could be some permanent arrangement which would enable Norwegian students to participate in the typically English form of university life that exists in the college system of Oxford and Cambridge. Without actual residence in a college this is impossible. But whereas foreign students have been able to attend courses at English universities, it has always been very difficult for them to obtain permission to reside at a college, sharing to the full all that the college environment can offer.&quot;

From 1920, with the exception of the years 1926–27 and the war years 1940–44, Norwegian students were awarded the Norway Scholarship for studies of the most varied description. However, as the basic funding of the scholarship proved inadequate, the scholars soon became dependent on supplementary grants from other university funds, but from the late 1970s even this arrangement proved inadequate to meet rising costs. For some years no scholars were appointed at all. The basic foundation capital had by then shrunk to only NOK. 130 000.- (about GBP 6500.- at the current rate of exchange). 

In the late 1970s Alf Bøe (Wadham. 1952) as head of the Committee, called on Andor Birkeland (Wadham. 1946) of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, accountant Sven Guldberg (Wadham. 1937) and former Minister for Culture Helge Sivertsen (Wadham. 1938). With the help of the College and of William Bentley, British Ambassador to Norway, they were able to raise NOK 1 170 000 (around GBP 117 000). In the 1990s Bøe formed a new committee consisting of Michael Benskin (St. Peter&#x27;s. 1965), Haakon Melander (Balliol. 1966) and Erik Rudeng (Norway scholar. 1969). Iver B. Neumann (Norway Scholar. 1988) was recruited in 1993. When Bøe retired in 2003, Neumann took over as chair. Bjørn Blindheim (Norway Scholar. 1992) and Neumann formed a Norwegian chapter of the Oxford Society, with Blindheim as chair. Since 1981 the Committee has organised an annual dinner with a guest of honour from Oxford University, who has also given one or more lectures locally in Oslo. King Harald V of Norway (Balliol College.1960) often participates at the grand dinner of Norway Scholars that is held each year in Oslo by the Oxford University Society Norway.

<text>Karekare is a small coastal settlement in West Auckland, New Zealand, sandwiched between the Waitākere Ranges and a large black sand surf beach.

== Geography ==
It is located west of Auckland city centre, south of the larger beach of Piha. It is north of Whatipu, south of Piha and west of the Centennial Memorial Park and Water Catchment area, which cover most of the native bushland Waitākere Ranges. Karekare Beach is the confluence of the Company Stream, which was traditionally known by the name Waiteahoaho, and the Karekare Stream. The Karekare Falls are located inland from the beach.

The beach at Karekare is split into two sections separated by the, Karekare Stream, Karekare Beach to the south and Tāhoro / Union Bay, to the north. Two major geographical sites within Karekare are The Watchman, traditionally known by the names Te Matua and Te Tokamatua, a significant knoll on the beach&#x27;s ridge, and Paratahi Island, located to the south of Karekare.

Karekare is the remains of an ancient volcanic crater of the Waitākere Volcano, which was uplifted due to tectonic forces between 3 and 5 million years ago. Te Matua (the Watchman) is the hardest remaining portion of dacite of the crater, and Paratahi Island is a lava dome.

==History==

Karekare, along with the greater Waitākere Ranges area, was traditionally settled by the Te Kawerau ā Maki iwi. Karekare is one of the few locations where textiles created prior to European contact have been preserved. The ocean between Piha and the Pararaha Valley was traditionally known as Waikarekare, referring to the turbulent waters of the Tasman Sea. Over time, the name was shortened to Kakare and Karekare, and was used for the beach and the general area.

A traditional Te Kawerau ā Maki legend of the area involves three rocks found on the beach. According to the legend, Te Matua (the Watchman), the large headland of the beach, had two children during Te Ao Kohatu, the age where inanimate things of the world could walk. Te Matua&#x27;s children would play at the beach, however one disobeyed their parent, and strayed too far away. When the age of Te Ao Kohatu ended, her two children were frozen in place: Te Tokapiri, the obedient child who remained close to their mother, and Te Tokapaoke, who stands at the southern end of Karekare, alone in the ocean. Te Tokapaoke became known as Paratahi Island.

Karekare was a major settlement for Te Kawerau ā Maki in the Waitākere Ranges, known for its extensive kūmara (sweet potato) cultivations inland. Te Kawerau ā Maki rangatira Kowhatu-ki-te-uru, known for his abilities to create stone pā, settled at Karekare in the mid-18th century. Directly north-east of the beach, Kowhatu-ki-te-uru built a pā known as Te Kaka Whakaara (&quot;The Kākā Parrot Standing Watch&quot;) on The Watchman (Te Matua), while the kāinga (village) near the pā was known as Te Marae o Mana, referring to Kowhatu-ki-te-uru&#x27;s son Manaairangi. The cultivations were known as Māraroa (&quot;The Great Gardens&quot;). Other significant pā in the area included one on Te Ahua Point, and one at Te Aoaho (above Karekare Falls).

In 1826 during the Musket Wars, Te Kaka Whakaara pā was attacked by two Ngāpuhi taua (war parties) led by Hōne Heke and Te Kahakaha. Te Kawerau ā Maki killed many of the Ngāpuhi taua by pelting them with rocks, however could not match the musket fire from the war parties. Te Kawerau ā Maki suffered many losses, especially at Wharengarahi, a cave on the beach where many of the tribe&#x27;s women, children and elderly were taking shelter. Due to the battle, Karekare was not occupied when Te Kawerau ā Maki returned after the war, due to the tapu caused by the deaths.

During the early colonial era, Karekare was the site of two Kauri mills: Karekau Sawmill, which operated between 1881 and 1886, and a smaller mill which opened in 1906. In the early 20th century, the lower Karekare valley was farmland, tended to by the Farley family. In 1935, the Karekare Surf Club was formed.

Into the modern era, artists such as Sir Peter Siddell and Joyce Campbell have lived in the area and called the beach home, being inspired by the regions landscape. Today, Karekare is home to the Karekare House Artists Residency, giving artists the opportunity to live in the historic Karekare House, and practice in the area for 3 month periods running from March to November every year. 

The region was heavily effected by Cyclone Gabrielle in February 2023, with many historic homes damaged or destroyed.

==Demographics==
Karekare is described by Statistics New Zealand as a rural settlement, and covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the Waitākere Ranges South SA2 statistical area.
Karekare had a population of 309 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 12 people (4.0%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 66 people (27.2%) since the 2013 census. There were 162 males, 144 females and 3 people of other genders in 108 dwellings. 4.9% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 41.4 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 66 people (21.4%) aged under 15 years, 36 (11.7%) aged 15 to 29, 153 (49.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 54 (17.5%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 92.2% European (Pākehā); 12.6% Māori; 1.9% Pasifika; 4.9% Asian; 2.9% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 3.9% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 96.1%, Māori language by 2.9%, and other languages by 16.5%. No language could be spoken by 1.9% (e.g. too young to talk). The percentage of people born overseas was 23.3, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 5.8% Christian, 1.0% Hindu, 1.0% Islam, 2.9% New Age, and 5.8% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 77.7%, and 6.8% of people did not answer the census question.

The median income was $37,900, compared with $41,500 nationally. 36 people (14.8%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 108 (44.4%) people were employed full-time, 45 (18.5%) were part-time, and 6 (2.5%) were unemployed.

== Tourism ==

At the turn of the century, holidaymakers would travel by coach from Glen Eden to stay at the Karekare guest house. Karekare continues to be a popular destination for Aucklanders in summer, but receives fewer visitors than nearby Piha, partly because the road is narrow and only recently sealed. There are surf patrols in summer.
The track to the base of the Waitakere waterfall—Karekare falls—is a short walk from the road. The track to the top of the falls is now closed to help stop the spread of the incurable Kauri dieback disease.
The settlement was immortalised in song by Crowded House on their &quot;Together Alone&quot; album in 1993, much of which was recorded at Karekare; the well known Dub/Reggae group, Salmonella Dub, used the name as well on their album &quot;Feel the Seasons Change - Live with the NZSO&quot;. The location will also be familiar to viewers of the film &quot;The Piano&quot;, which included beach scenes shot at Karekare and Piha.

== Safety information ==

The rips along this section of coast are very unpredictable and can shift with little warning, and have caused a number of drownings. Lifeguards advise swimming between the red and yellow flags, during patrol hours.

==Education==
There is a small community primary school (Lone Kauri School) with approximately 30 students located at Karekare. It is an independently operating branch of Oratia School, under the supervision of a senior teacher.

<text>The Ordnance BL 2.75-inch mountain gun was a screw gun designed for and used by the Indian Mountain Artillery into World War I.

==Description==
The gun was an improved version of the 1901 BL 10-pounder mountain gun.

The new 1911 version improved on the 1901 gun with a new pole trail, recoil buffer, recuperator and gun shield, and increased shell weight from 10 to . It was a screw gun design, where the barrel could be separated into two parts via a screw joint. This allowed for the gun to have a heavier barrel, but still be broken into smaller portions for transport by mule teams. This was important for a weapon designed to be used in mountainous and rough terrain, or where adequate vehicle and horse transport was not readily available. The weapon could be carried by six mules or towed.

==Service history==

The gun was adopted in 1911 and began entering service in 1914.

The weapon served primarily with the Indian Mountain Artillery in the northwest portion of British Indian territory (on what is now the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan) and participated in British-led military action in that theatre.

It also served in Mesopotamia and the Salonika front during World War I.

Due to its specialised nature the gun was produced in only limited numbers, with just 183 manufactured during the war.

It was superseded at the end of World War I by the QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer.

==Surviving examples==

A 2.75-inch mountain gun is on display at the Heugh Battery Museum, Hartlepool

<text>The term cleanser refers to a product that cleans or removes dirt or other substances. A cleanser could be a detergent, and there are many types of cleansers that are produced with a specific objective or focus. For instance, a degreaser or carburetor cleanser used in automotive mechanics for cleaning certain engine and car parts.

Other varieties include the ones used in cosmetology, dermatology or general skin care. In this case, a cleanser is a facial care product that is used to remove make-up, skin care product residue, microbes, dead skin cells, oils, sweat, dirt and other types of daily pollutants from the face. These washing aids help prevent filth-accumulation, infections, clogged pores, irritation and cosmetic issues like dullness from dead skin buildup &amp; excessive skin shine from sebum buildup. This can also aid in preventing or treating certain skin conditions; such as acne. Cleansing is the first step in a skin care regimen and can be used in addition of a toner and moisturizer, following cleansing or using makeup remover cotton and makeup remover.

Sometimes &quot;double cleansing&quot; before moving on to any other skincare product is encouraged to ensure the full dissolution &amp; removal of residues that might be more resistant to cleansing, such as; waterproof makeup, water-resistant sunscreen, the excess sebum of oily skin-type individuals and air pollution particles. Double cleansing usually involves applying a lipid-soluble cleanser (e.g. cleansing balm, cleansing oil, micellar cleansing water) to dry skin and massaging it around the face for a length of time, then the area may or may not be splashed with water. Any type of aqueous cleanser is then emulsified with water and used as the main cleanser that removes the first cleanser and further cleans the skin. Then the face is finally thoroughly rinsed with water until no filth or product residue remains.

Using a cleanser designated for the facial skin to remove dirt is considered to be a better alternative to bar soap or another form of skin cleanser not specifically formulated for the face for the following reasons:
* Bar soap has an alkaline pH (in the area of 9 to 10), and the pH of a healthy skin surface is around 4.7 on average. This means that soap can change the balance present in the skin to favor the overgrowth of some types of bacteria, increasing acne. In order to maintain a healthy pH balance and skin health, your skin must sit on the proper pH level; some individuals who use bar soap choose to use pH-balancing toners after cleaning in attempts to compensate for the alkalinity of their soaps.
* Bar cleansers have thickeners that allow them to assume a bar shape. These thickeners can clog pores, which may lead to pimples in susceptible individuals. Wet dry shampoos, face wash and body washes are often labeled as &quot;bar cleansers&quot; because they have thickeners that allow them to assume a bar shape. These thickeners can clog pores, which may lead to pimples in susceptible individuals.
* Using bar soap on the face can remove natural oils from the skin that form a barrier against water loss. This causes the sebaceous glands to subsequently overproduce oil, a condition known as reactive seborrhoea, which will lead to clogged pores. In order to prevent drying out the skin, many cleansers incorporate moisturizers.

== Facial cleansers==
Facial cleansers include the following: 
#Balm cleansers
#Bar cleansers
#Clay cleansers 
#Cold cream cleansers
#Creamy cleansers
#Exfoliant/Scrub cleansers
#Foam/Foaming cleansers
#Gel/Jelly cleansers
#Lotion cleansers
#Micellar cleansers
#Milky cleansers
#Oil cleansers
#Powder cleansers 
#Treatment/Medicated cleansers (&quot;aloe vera, benzoyl peroxide, carboxylic acids, charcoal, colloidal oatmeal, honey, sulphur, vitamin c, lighteners)&quot;
#Tool cleansers (&quot;cotton rounds, konjac sponges, microfiber cloths, mitts, silicone brushes, spinning brushes, sponges, towelettes/wipes)&quot;

Cleansers that have active ingredients are more suitable for oily skins to prevent breakouts. But they may overdry and irritate dry skin, this may make the skin appear and feel worse. Dehydrated skin may require a creamy lotion-type cleanser. These are normally too gentle to be effective on oily or even normal skin, but dry skin requires much less cleansing power. It may be a good idea to select a cleanser that is alcohol-free for use on dry, sensitive, or dehydrated skin.

Some cleansers may incorporate fragrance or essential oils. However, for some people, these cleansers may irritate the skin and often provoke allergic responses. People with such sensitivity should find cleansers that are pH-balanced cosmetic balanced, contain fewer irritants, suit many variating skin types, and do not make the skin feel dehydrated directly after cleansing. Tight, uncomfortable skin is often dehydrated and may appear shiny after cleansing, even when no sebum is present. This is due to the taughtening and &#x27;stripping&#x27; effect some cleaners can have on the skin. One should discontinue use of a cleanser that upsets the balance of the skin; cleansers should work with the skin not against it. Finding the right cleanser can involve some trial-and-error.

<text>Sweet Kisses is the debut studio album by American singer Jessica Simpson, released in the United States on November 23, 1999, by Columbia Records. Its lyrical and visual representations carry the common theme of virginal innocence, a continuation of 1999&#x27;s teen-pop revival. It was produced to capitalize on the success of teen artists Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who both debuted earlier that year. &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; was a hit in the US, peaking at number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, and was certified 2× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of over two million copies. As of February 2009, it has sold 1.9 million copies in the US.

&quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; spawned three singles, including Simpson&#x27;s debut single: &quot;I Wanna Love You Forever&quot;, which is her biggest hit in the US. The second single was a duet: &quot;Where You Are&quot; with future husband Nick Lachey of 98 Degrees. The third single was a dance track: &quot;I Think I&#x27;m in Love With You&quot;, which samples &quot;Jack &amp; Diane&quot; by John Cougar Mellencamp.

==Background==
Simpson first developed and nurtured her talent in her local Baptist church, where her father also worked as the congregation&#x27;s youth minister. At age twelve, she unsuccessfully auditioned for &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. While attending a church camp, at the age of 13, Simpson sang Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and an arrangement of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;. One of the camp&#x27;s visitors was launching a Gospel music record label and saw great promise and profits in her voice. It was during this time, while attending J. J. Pearce High School, Simpson signed to Proclaim Records, a minor Gospel music record label. She recorded an album, &quot;Jessica&quot;, but Proclaim went bankrupt and the album was never officially released except for a small pressing funded by her grandmother. This small pressing gained her minor attention which led her to performing at concerts with other gospel legendary acts such as Kirk Franklin, God&#x27;s Property, and CeCe Winans. When she was seventeen years old, Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola heard &quot;Jessica&quot;, he was impressed with Simpson&#x27;s musical talent and skill. Mottola instantly thought Simpson sounded like Mariah Carey. Simpson was immediately signed to the label. She dropped out of high school but later earned her GED.

Simpson also collaborated with Sam Watters for the album. Watters produced the singles &quot;I Wanna Love You Forever&quot; and &quot;Where You Are&quot;, as well as &quot;Heart of Innocence&quot;. Watters also co-wrote the track &quot;I Wanna Love You Forever&quot;, along with Louis Biancaniello. Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers also produced the tracks &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Eyes On You&quot; and &quot;Betcha She Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; together.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; was released on 23 November 1999 through Columbia Records in United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Following year, it was released in Japan, on 19 January 2000 through Sony Music Entertainment. The album was released in the United Kingdom on 24 April 2000.

===Singles===
&quot;I Wanna Love You Forever&quot; was the first single released from the album in September 1999. The song became Simpson&#x27;s highest-charting single in the United States, peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Its commercial sales were particularly strong, landing atop the Hot 100 Singles Sales for six weeks; the song later received a platinum certification. It was also a top ten hit in Canada. Worldwide, the single was also successful. It peaked within the top ten in most European nations and Australia, which reached the top ten in Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium and Australia.

&quot;Where You Are&quot; was released as the second single from the album. The single failed to reach even the top fifty of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at sixty-two. The song did, however, become a relative Adult Contemporary hit. The song became a hit on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales reaching number four. Internationally, the song was not released in major music markets excluding Canada.

&quot;I Think I&#x27;m In Love With You&quot; was the third and final single released from the album and became a moderate hit, reaching number twenty-one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 largely on the strength of its radio airplay; it reached the top five on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 40 Mainstream and achieved success on the Adult Contemporary and Rhythmic Top 40 charts. Worldwide, it was a moderate hit, peaking at number ten on Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and reached the top twenty in Canada, United Kingdom and New Zealand.

==Critical reception==

The album received mostly mixed reviews. Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars, quoting, &quot;She delves into the frothy dance-pop that&#x27;s teen pop&#x27;s stock-in-trade, but the heart of her album lies in adult contemporary ballads like her breakout hit &quot;I Wanna Love You Forever,&quot; which gives her a chance to show off the richness of her voice. She doesn&#x27;t over-sing, like Aguilera occasionally does, even if she has moments where she pushes the envelope slightly — just like her idol Dion. However, there are already indications that she&#x27;s developing her own voice, since she is equally capable of delivering danceable urban R&amp;B (&quot;Final Heartbreak,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Eyes on You,&quot; the Destiny&#x27;s Child duet &quot;Woman in Me&quot;) as she is mature balladry (&quot;Faith in Me,&quot; the Nick Lachey duet &quot;Where You Are&quot;). Like most teen-pop albums, &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; suffers from inconsistent material, yet the filler is well-produced and performed, making the record every bit as listenable as Aguilera&#x27;s fine debut.&quot; &quot;People Magazine&quot; was less critical of the album, quoting &quot;Blonde, pouty-lipped and impossibly cute, Jessica Simpson is as tough to pick out of a lineup of lookalike teenage songbirds as her breathless hit &quot;I Wanna Love You Forever&quot; is difficult to differentiate from the rest of Top 40 radio. So far, Simpson&#x27;s debut album hasn&#x27;t scored the same success as those of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. But rest assured there are more cookies like &quot;I Wanna&quot; in Simpson&#x27;s cutter. One ditty, titled &quot;Where Are You,&quot; is a duet with 98° boy-toy Nick Lachey, Simpson&#x27;s real-life squeeze. Unlike her peers the 19-year-old Simpson is not a former member of Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse Club. She auditioned for the show at age 12 but didn&#x27;t make the cut. Also setting her apart from the teen pop pack is Simpson&#x27;s track record as a performer on the Christian music circuit. Here, she sounds downright worldly singing &quot;Heart of Innocence&quot;—a devotional tune she wrote extolling the virtues of premarital abstinence—in a low, sexy croon. Bottom Line: Teen yearnings set to a watery R&amp;B beat.&quot; Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; as a hopeful debut when comparing her next album negatively to it.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a C−, stating &quot;Jessica Simpson, a melodramatic 19, chirps cheeky Mariah Carey-isms on Sweet Kisses, a subpar portfolio, missing the soulful target almost every time. &#x27;Do you wanna see the woman in me?/Let me show you,&#x27; she lasciviously hisses in one laughable instance, backed by a doo-wopping Destiny&#x27;s Child. Uh, thanks, but no, kid. Been there, done that. Mom&#x27;s waiting for you outside in the station wagon.&quot; Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;: &quot;Simpson is a blonde who got out of cheerleading early to prepare herself for whatever show business offered--game-show sidekick, R-rated remake of &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot;, bond trader seeking trophy wife. What she got was a John Cougar Mellencamp sample and the hard-earned ability to carry a tune. We know teenpop is rarely as vapid, prefab, and faux-wholesome as gatekeepers who&#x27;ve barely listened to it claim. So let&#x27;s not tell them about this &#x27;refreshing blend of pop, R&amp;B and [note copywriter getting desperate] gospel-flavored sounds.&#x27;&quot;

==Commercial performance==
Initially, &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; debuted at number sixty-five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 65,000 copies in its first week, significantly lower than expected by Columbia Records, as the first single from the album was a hit, peaking at #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The following week, the album had dropped to number seventy, and continuing down the following weeks. To boost record sales, the label released the second single &quot;Where You Are&quot;, but could not reach the success of its predecessor &quot;I Wanna Love You Forever&quot;. While &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; was kept in the top sixty for several weeks, the label decided to make one last attempt to launch the third single from the album. &quot;I Think I&#x27;m in Love With You&quot; was released in May 2000, instantly became a hit on radio stations that helped to rise from posts and the album reached the peak of twenty-five in August 2000. In total, the album stayed on the chart for sixty-two weeks. The album was certified 2× Platinum by the RIAA. As of February 2009, the album has sold 1.9 million copies in the United States. In territories outside of the United States, the album had a similar chart effect. In Canada, &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; peaked at number thirty-four on the Canadian Albums Chart. The album stayed on the chart for 37 weeks. Later it was certified Platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA; now Music Canada).

In Europe, the album performed better on the charts, peaking at number four in Norway and was certified Gold for sales 15,000 copies in that territory. and number five in Switzerland and remains Simpson&#x27;s only top five album in that territory. It also peaked at number fifty-five in Sweden. In Japan, the album debuted at number sixteen on the Oricon albums chart, making it her only album to date to chart within the top twenty in Japan. In the United Kingdom, where the singles were met with a great commercial performance, the album debuted at number thirty-six. This makes &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; Simpson&#x27;s highest-charting album in the United Kingdom, tied with her third studio album &quot;In This Skin&quot; (2003). In Australia, the album debuted at number fifty-two, surprising the label as the album had spawned two top ten hits in the country. In total, &quot;Sweet Kisses&quot; has sold four million copies worldwide.

<doc id="1228843" wikidata="Q930427" url="?curid=1228843" title="Tuil">
<text>Tuil is a village in the Dutch province of Gelderland. It is a part of the municipality of West Betuwe, and lies about 14 km west of the town Tiel.

Jan Willem Boellaard has been Lord of Tuil since 1956.

==History==

The area now encompassing the village of Tuil was inhabited in Roman times by the Batavians, but by about 800 AD Frankish tribes had occupied the site. The River Waal in this area originally meandered to the north of the present river&#x27;s course, but spontaneously straightened in the 13th century due to increased river flow, leaving the village streets running at right angles to the river. By the 19th century, after repeated dike breaks at Tuil, a new dike was built along the present-day route that severely truncated the village.

The first known mentions of Tuil appear in feudal documents of 963 AD and 1031 AD. In the 14th century, four members of the family Felder lived near the village of Tuil, and three others to the northern farmland, along the River Linge. This establishes the village of as the place of origin for the family name Felder.

<doc id="1228845" wikidata="Q3006091" url="?curid=1228845" title="Moisturizer">
<text>A moisturizer, or emollient, is a cosmetic preparation used for protecting, moisturizing, and lubricating the skin. These functions are normally performed by sebum produced by healthy skin. The word &quot;emollient&quot; is derived from the Latin verb &quot;mollire&quot;, to soften.

== Mechanism of action ==

In the human body, water constantly evaporates from the deeper layers of the skin through an effect known as transepidermal water loss. By regulating its water content, human skin naturally maintains a dry, easily shed surface as a barrier against pathogens, dirt, or damage, while protecting itself from drying out and becoming brittle and rigid. The ability to retain moisture depends on the lipid bilayer between the dead skin cells.

Moisturizers modify the rate of water loss, with active ingredients of moisturizers falling into one of two categories: occlusives and humectants.

&quot;Occlusives&quot; form a hydrophobic coating on the surface of the skin, keeping moisture from escaping. The more occlusive the formulation, the greater the effect. Ointments are more occlusive than aqueous creams, which are more occlusive than lotion. Water loss through the skin is normally about 4–8 g/(m2⋅h). A layer of petrolatum applied to normal skin can reduce that loss by 50–75% for several hours. Oils naturally produced by the human body moisturize through this same mechanism.

&quot;Humectants&quot; are hydrophilic and absorb water. They absorb water from humid air (when &gt;70% humidity) to moisturize the skin. More commonly, however, they draw out water from the dermis into the epidermis, making deeper skin dryer. When used in practical applications, humectants are combined with occlusives. Moisturizers commonly contain water, which acts as a temporary hydration agent.

== Types ==
There are many different types of moisturizers. Petrolatum is one of the most effective moisturizers, although it can be unpopular due to its oily consistency. 

Other popular moisturizers are cetyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, cocoa butter, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, lanolin, liquid paraffin, polyethylene glycols, shea butter, silicone oils, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol and castor oil, and other oils.

Moisturizers may also be available as lotions, creams, ointments, bath oils, or soap substitutes.

Mineral oils and waxes are not prone to oxidation or rancidity. For this reason, they have essentially replaced vegetable oils in emollients and topical medication.

Moisturizer cosmetics may additionally contain antioxidants, ceramides, emulsifiers, fragrances, penetration enhancers, preservatives, and solvents. Some products are marketed as having anti-wrinkle and skin enhancement effects. Many plant and animal extracts have been claimed to impart skin benefits, but such claims are presented with little scientific evidence.

== Use ==
Moisturizers are used for the treatment of certain skin diseases, such as psoriasis, ichthyosis vulgaris, xerosis, and pruritus in atopic dermatitis. More often, they are bases or vehicles for topical medication, such as in Whitfield&#x27;s ointment. They are often combined with humectants, such as salicylic acid and urea.

Moisturizers are also widely used in sunscreens, antiperspirants, skin cleansers, shaving creams, aftershaves, and hair tonics.

Moisturizers are used in disposable diapers to prevent dry skin and diaper dermatitis.

Moisturizers show some beneficial effects in treating atopic dermatitis (eczema). Using moisturizers helps to improve skin comfort and may reduce disease flares. They can be used as leave-on treatments, bath additives, or soap substitutes. There are many different moisturizer products, but the majority of leave-on treatments (from least to most greasy) are one of the following: lotions, creams, gels, or ointments. As none of the different types of moisturizers are more effective than the others, people with atopic dermatitis need to choose one or more products according to their age, affected body site, climate/season, and personal preference. However using moisturizers daily in infants during the first year of life does not help to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis, and might even increase the risk of skin infections.

== Potential health risks ==

=== Over-moisturization ===

Persistent moisturization to the skin via water contact may contribute to an allergic reaction or contact dermatitis. This could allow foreign objects to penetrate the skin. 

Changes in the skin&#x27;s normal ecological environment–either atop or within the skin–can also allow for the overgrowth of pathogens.

=== Allergens ===

Aromas or food additives in moisturizers may trigger an immune reaction, including development of an allergy.

There is currently no regulation over use of the term &quot;hypoallergenic&quot;. In fact, some pediatric skin products marketed as hypoallergenic contained allergens. 

Those with eczema are especially vulnerable to allergic reaction with lotions and creams, as their compromised skin barrier allows preservatives to bind with and activate immune cells.

The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology released a warning in 2014 that natural lotion containing ingredients commonly found in food (such as goats milk, cow&#x27;s milk, coconut milk, or oil) may introduce new allergies, potentially causing an allergic reaction upon later consuming such foods. A paper published in 2021 noted that frequent skin moisturization in early life might promote the development of food allergy, even when skin conditions such as eczema are taken into account.

=== Fire risk ===

Paraffin-based skincare products and contaminated clothing can pose a serious fire hazard. Between 2010 and 2018, paraffin was linked to 50 fire incidents (49 of which were fatal) in the U.K. A West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service study found that clothing contaminated with cream containing only 21% paraffin, when set alight, was fully engulfed in flame in 3 seconds. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) released a warning in 2008 about the flammability of paraffin-based products. MHRA recommends that regular paraffin users change their sheets regularly, refrain from smoking and/or bringing open flames near paraffin-coated people or objects. MHRA also recommends that skin creams containing any paraffin have a flammability warning on the packaging.

<doc id="1228848" wikidata="Q5337931" url="?curid=1228848" title="Edgeworth's limit theorem">
<text>Edgeworth&#x27;s limit theorem is an economic theorem, named after Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, stating that the core of an economy shrinks to the set of Walrasian equilibria as the number of agents increases to infinity.

That is, among all possible outcomes which may result from free market exchange or barter between groups of people, while the precise location of the final settlement (the ultimate division of goods) between the parties is not uniquely determined, as the number of traders increases, the set of all possible final settlements converges to the set of Walrasian equilibria.

Intuitively, it may be interpreted as stating that as an economy grows larger, agents increasingly behave as if they are price-taking agents, even if they have the power to bargain.

Edgeworth (1881) conjectured the theorem, and provided most of the necessary intuition and went some way towards its proof. Formal proofs were presented under different assumptions by Debreu and Scarf (1963) as well as Aumann (1964), both proved under conditions stricter than what Edgeworth conjectured. Debreu and Scarf considered the case of a &quot;replica economy&quot; where there is a finite number of agent types and the agents added to the economy to make it &quot;large&quot; are of the same type and in the same proportion as those already in it. Aumann&#x27;s result relied on an existence of a continuum of agents.

== The core of an economy ==

The core of an economy is a concept from cooperative game theory defined as the set of feasible allocations in an economy that cannot be improved upon by subset of the set of the economy&#x27;s consumers (a coalition). For general equilibrium economies typically the core is non-empty (there is at least one feasible allocation) but also &quot;large&quot; in the sense that there may be a continuum of feasible allocations that satisfy the requirements. The conjecture basically states that if the number of agents is also &quot;large&quot; then the only allocations in the core are precisely what a competitive market would produce. As such, the conjecture is seen as providing some game-theoretic foundations for the usual assumption in general equilibrium theory of price taking agents. In particular, it means that in a &quot;large&quot; economy people act as if they were price takers, even though theoretically they have all the power to set prices and renegotiate their trades. Hence, the fictitious Walrasian auctioneer of general equilibrium, while strictly speaking completely unrealistic, can be seen as a &quot;short-cut&quot; to getting the right answer.

==Illustration when there are only two commodities==
Francis Ysidro Edgeworth first described what later became known as the limit theorem in his book &quot;Mathematical Psychics&quot; (1881). He used a variant of what is now known as the Edgeworth box (with quantities traded, rather than quantities possessed, on the relevant axes) to analyse trade between groups of traders of various sizes. In general he found that &#x27;Contract without competition is indeterminate, contract with perfect competition is perfectly determinate, [and] contract with more or less perfect competition is less or more indeterminate.&#x27;

===Trade without competition===

If trade in two goods, X and Y, occurs between a single pair of traders, A and B, the potential outcomes of this trade can be shown in an Edgeworth box (&quot;Figure 1&quot;). In this diagram A and B initially possess the entire stock of X and Y respectively (point E). The lines U(a) and U(b) are the indifference curves of A and B which run through points representing combinations of goods which give utility equal to their initial holdings. As trade here is assumed to be non-coercive, neither of the traders will agree to a final settlement which leaves them worse off than they started off and thus U(a) and U(b) represent the outer boundaries of possible settlements. Edgeworth demonstrated that traders will ultimately reach a point on the contract curve (between C and C&#x27;) through a stylized bargaining process which is termed the recontracting process. As neither person can be made better off without the other being made worse off at points on the contract curve, once the traders agree to settle at a point on it, this is a final settlement. Exactly where the final settlement will be on the contract curve cannot be determined. It will depend on the bargaining process between the two people; the party who is able to obtain an advantage while bargaining will be able to obtain a better price for his or her goods and thus receive the higher gains from trade.

This was Edgeworth&#x27;s key finding - the result of trade between two people can be predicted within a certain range but the exact outcome is indeterminate. 

===Trade with less than perfect competition===
Suppose a single extra pair of identical traders is added to this initial pair. As these new traders are identical to the first pair, the same Edgeworth box can be used to analyse the exchange. To examine the new outer limits of the trade, Edgeworth considered the situation where trade occurs at the limit of trade between two people (point C or C&#x27; in &quot;Figure 2&quot;). If trade were to occur at point C one of the B&#x27;s (say B(1)) would receive all the gains from trade. The one A who trades with B(1) (say A(1)) now has a mix of goods X and Y which he is able to trade with A(2). As the two A&#x27;s are identical, they will agree to split their post-trade endowments equally between them, placing them at point P in &quot;Figure 2&quot; which gives them a higher utility than they would otherwise receive (indifference curve U&#x27;(a) instead of U(a)). B(2) now has an opportunity and strong incentive to offer the A&#x27;s a better price for their goods and trade with them at this price, leaving B(1) out in the cold. This process of B&#x27;s competing against one another to offer the A&#x27;s a better price will continue until the A&#x27;s are indifferent between trading at P and trading on the contract curve (&quot;Figure 3&quot;). The same reasoning can be applied to the case where A(1) initially receives all the gains from trade, and it can be shown that the outermost limit given by U(b) will also move inwards. This is called the shrinking core of the market - as an extra pair of traders is added, the feasible range of trades shrinks.
If a third pair of traders is added, the core of the market shrinks further. If trade occurs at the limit where B(1) gets all the gains from trade, the point P is now two thirds of the way along the line EC. This improves the bargaining power of the A&#x27;s who are able to get onto a higher indifference curve as B&#x27;s compete to trade with them. The outer limit of final settlement where there are multiple pairs of traders can be generalised (&quot;Figure 4&quot;) where K = (n-1)/n.

===Trade with perfect competition===

If there is a sufficient number of traders, the core of the market will shrink such that the point of final settlement is perfectly determinate (&quot;Figure 5&quot;). This point is equal to the price-taking equilibrium at which trade is assumed to take place at in models of perfect competition.

===Generalisation===
This analysis can be modified to accommodate traders who are not identical or who have motivations which aren&#x27;t purely selfish as well as the situation where one group of traders is larger than the other. If the traders are heterogeneous the point P will not reflect a &quot;split the difference&quot; trade between the group of traders and the outer limit of trade determined by this point will be modified accordingly. If the utility of one trader(s) influences the utility of another (i.e. the latter is not selfish) then the associated limit of the contract curve will shrink inwards, ruling out the most inequitable trades. If the groups of traders are differently sized, the outer limits of the contract curve will not shrink an equal amount.

<doc id="1228869" wikidata="Q3435918" url="?curid=1228869" title="Robert H. Michel">
<text>Robert Henry Michel (; March 2, 1923 – February 17, 2017) was an American Republican Party politician who was a member of the United States House of Representatives for 38 years. He represented central Illinois&#x27; 18th congressional district, and was the GOP leader in the House, serving as House Minority Leader during his last 14 years in Congress (1981–1995).

His tenure in leadership occurred during the latter part of the decades-long era in which the Democratic Party held a majority in the House of Representatives. Well known for his bipartisanship and friendship with prominent Democrats in the House, Michel was eventually eclipsed by Newt Gingrich and other younger Republicans who favored a more hardball style. Michel did not seek re-election in the 1994 midterm elections, where Gingrich led the Republican Revolution that resulted in the GOP taking control of the House for the first time in 40 years.

==Early life==
Michel was born and raised in Peoria, Illinois. His father was an immigrant from Alsace and his mother was the daughter of German immigrants. He attended Peoria High School. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Bradley University.

==Military service==
When the U.S. entered the Second World War, Michel joined the United States Army and served with the 39th Infantry Regiment as an infantryman in England, France, Belgium, and Germany from February 10, 1943, to January 26, 1946, while also participating in the Invasion of Normandy in 1944. He was wounded by machine gun fire and awarded two Bronze Stars, the Purple Heart, and four battle stars.

==Education and early career==
After the war ended, Michel attended Bradley University in Peoria, graduating in 1948. From 1949 to 1956, he worked as an administrative assistant to U.S. Representative Harold Velde.

==Electoral career==

Although Michel was never part of the majority party, during his 38 years in the House he was noted for his bipartisanship in striking bargains. Michel was well respected across the aisle and was good friends with Democrats such as Speaker Thomas &quot;Tip&quot; O&#x27;Neill and Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski.

Michel was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1956 and served until his retirement on January 3, 1995. He served as Minority Whip from 94th Congress through the 96th Congress. Michel served from 1959 to 1980 as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, including 12 years as the ranking Republican on the Labor, Health, Education and Welfare Subcommittee. Later, he served as House Minority Leader from the 97th Congress through 103rd Congresses. Michel voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Michel voted in favor of the House amendment to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on July 9, 1965, but voted against the joint conference committee report on August 3, 1965.

Michel&#x27;s toughest re-election was probably during the 1982 midterms, when he was in a tight race due to dissatisfaction over U.S. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s economic policies and the 1982 recession. Reagan travelled to Peoria to campaign for him.
Michel voted in favor the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday in August 1983. In March 1988, Michel voted against the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to uphold President Reagan&#x27;s veto). Michel stirred a controversy in 1988 when he recalled enjoying and participating in blackface minstrel shows as a young man, and said he missed the shows. He also compared the removal of racially offensive words in songs such as &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; to the Soviet re-writing of history. He later apologized for having given offence, explaining that he was honestly attempting to understand and accept changes in U.S. culture.

In the early 1990s, Newt Gingrich and other young, aggressive conservative congressmen criticized Michel for being too easy-going and not fighting hard enough for Republican goals in the House. Supporters said Michel&#x27;s practice of socializing with Democrats over a game of golf or cards resulted in deals that moved bills through the legislative process. It was also noted that Michel&#x27;s voting was nearly as conservative as Gingrich&#x27;s.
During negotiations with the Democrats who held majorities in the House and Senate, President George H. W. Bush reached a deficit reduction package which contained tax increases despite his campaign promise of &quot;read my lips: no new taxes&quot;. Gingrich led a revolt that defeated the initial appropriations package and led to the 1990 United States federal government shutdown. The deal was supported by the President and Congressional leaders from both parties after long negotiations, but Gingrich walked out during a televised event in the White House Rose Garden. Michel characterized Gingrich&#x27;s revolt as &quot;a thousand points of spite&quot;.
In 1993 Michel gave the rebuttal to President Bill Clinton&#x27;s address to a joint session of Congress, criticizing the economic policies of the newly inaugurated president. &quot;The Clinton spin doctors have even given us a new political vocabulary, if you will – investment now means big government spending your tax dollars. Change now means reviving old, discredited big government tax-and-spend schemes. Patriotism now means agreeing with the Clinton program. The powerful evocative word, sacrifice, has been reduced to the level of a bumper sticker slogan&quot;, he said. He was later criticized for obstructing Clinton&#x27;s economic stimulus plan.

As a result of Gingrich&#x27;s rising prominence which gradually attracted support from the caucus, Michel decided not to seek re-election in the 1994 mid-term elections. Had Michel run in the 1994 elections and won, he would have served in a Republican-controlled House for the first time in his entire Congressional career. However, the caucus would have likely favored Gingrich over Michel as Speaker of the House, due to Gingrich&#x27;s central role in the Republican Revolution. In announcing his retirement, Michel complained that some of his fellow congressmen were more interested in picking fights than in passing laws. Gingrich had a confrontational style, which contrasted sharply with Michel&#x27;s bipartisanship, but Republicans retained the majority during his term. Gingrich&#x27;s successor as Speaker, Dennis Hastert, stated his desire to return to Michel&#x27;s style.

Michel was succeeded in Congress by his longtime chief of staff, Ray LaHood. Several years after Michel&#x27;s retirement, LaHood praised his former boss. Michel &quot;knew warfare first hand&quot;, LaHood said. &quot;That is the reason he never used the macho phrases like &#x27;warfare&#x27; and &#x27;take no prisoners&#x27; when discussing politics with his staff. To Bob, the harsh, personal rhetoric of ideological warfare had no place in his office, no place in the House, and no place in American politics.&quot;

==Namesakes and honors==
On January 18, 1989, outgoing president Ronald Reagan conferred upon him the Presidential Citizens Medal, the second highest civilian award given, making him the 7th recipient of the honor. On August 8, 1994, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States, by President Bill Clinton. He was one of the recipients of the first Congressional Distinguished Service Award in 2000, along with John Rhodes, Louis Stokes, and Don Edwards. This honor was created by then-Speaker Dennis Hastert and then-Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. In 2010, he was given the Schachman Award by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The Society commended him for his post-congressional work in increasing public and congressional support for the National Institutes of Health which contributed to the doubling of the NIH&#x27;s budget.

During the 1960s Michel was a frequent winning pitcher in the annual Democrats vs. Republicans baseball game, and in 1993, the Capitol Hill publication &quot;Roll Call&quot;, named him to its Baseball Hall of Fame.

In 1994, Michel received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.
The Bob Michel Bridge, carrying Illinois Route 40 across the Illinois River at Peoria, is named after Robert H. Michel as is the Robert H. Michel Student Center at Bradley University. In the United States Capitol, the second-floor suite of offices occupied by the Speaker were designated the Robert H. Michel Rooms by the House in 1995. At the Capitol Hill Club located adjacent to the Republican National Committee, the cloak room is named for Bob Michel. In Peoria, Illinois, the VA Clinic is named the Bob Michel Community Based Outpatient Clinic. The Robert H. Michel Lifetime Achievement Award is presented by the Creve Coeur Club of Peoria each year at the club&#x27;s Washington Day Banquet to recognize community leadership.

Robert H. Michel was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State&#x27;s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1997 in the area of Government.

==Personal life and death==
Michel was married to Corinne Woodruff (Michel) from 1948 until her death in 2003. The couple had four children, Scott, Bruce, Robin, and Laurie.

In 1978, he required hospital treatment after he was robbed and beaten by youths outside his Washington, D.C. home. One perpetrator was caught and convicted in juvenile court of assault on a member of Congress and assault with intent to rob.

Michel died on February 17, 2017, at the age of 93, from pneumonia in Arlington, Virginia.

<text>Raggedy Ann is a character created by American writer Johnny Gruelle (1880–1938) that appeared in a series of books he wrote and illustrated for young children. Raggedy Ann is a rag doll with red yarn for hair and a triangle nose. The character was created in 1915, as a doll, and was introduced to the public in the 1918 book &quot;Raggedy Ann Stories&quot;. When a doll was marketed with the book, the concept had great success. A sequel, &quot;Raggedy Andy Stories&quot; (1920), introduced the character of her brother, Raggedy Andy. Further characters such as Beloved Belindy, a black mammy doll, were featured as dolls and characters in books.

==Origins==
The exact details of the origins of the Raggedy Ann doll and related stories, which were created by Johnny Gruelle, are not specifically known, although numerous myths and legends about the doll&#x27;s origins have been widely repeated. Gruelle biographer and Raggedy Ann historian Patricia Hall notes that the dolls have &quot;found themselves at the center of several legend cycles—groups of stories that, while containing kernels of truth, are more myth than they are history. What makes this even more intriguing is that fact that Johnny Gruelle, either unwittingly or with the great sense of humor he was known for, initiated many of these legends, a number of which are continuously repeated as the factual history of Raggedy Ann and Andy.&quot;

Hall further explains that according to an oft-repeated myth, Gruelle&#x27;s daughter Marcella brought down from her grandmother&#x27;s attic a faceless cloth doll on which the artist drew a face, and that Gruelle suggested that Marcella&#x27;s grandmother sew a shoe button for a missing eye. Hall says the date of this supposed occurrence is given as early as 1900 and as late as 1914, with the locale variously given as suburban Indianapolis, Indiana, downtown Cleveland, Ohio, or rural Connecticut. More likely, as Gruelle&#x27;s wife Myrtle reported, it was her husband who retrieved a long-forgotten, homemade rag doll from the attic of his parents&#x27; Indianapolis home sometime around the turn of the twentieth century before the couple&#x27;s daughter was born. Although the incident is unconfirmed, Myrtle Gruelle recalled, &quot;There was something he wanted from the attic. While he was rummaging around for it, he found an old rag doll his mother had made for his sister. He said then that the doll would make a good story.&quot; Myrtle Gruelle also indicated that her husband &quot;kept [the doll] in his mind until we had Marcella. He remembered it when he saw her play [with] dolls ... He wrote the stories around some of the things she did. He used to get ideas from watching her.&quot;

Additionally, Gruelle did not create Raggedy Ann as a tribute to his daughter following her death at 13 from an infected vaccination. Hall notes Gruelle&#x27;s May 28, 1915, application for the design of the prototype that became the Raggedy Ann doll was already in progress around the time that Marcella fell ill, and the artist received final approval by the U.S. Patent office on September 7, 1915. Nonetheless, the anti-vaccination movement adopted Raggedy Ann as a symbol, though Marcella died from an infected vaccination, not from the side effects of the vaccination itself.

==Naming Raggedy Ann==
On June 17, 1915, shortly after submitting his patent application for the doll&#x27;s design, Johnny Gruelle applied for a registered trademark for the Raggedy Ann name, which he created by combining words from two of James Whitcomb Riley poems, &quot;The Raggedy Man&quot; and &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot;. (Riley was a well-known Hoosier poet and a Gruelle family friend and neighbor from the years when they resided in Indianapolis.) The U.S. Patent Office registered Gruelle&#x27;s trademark application (107328) for the Raggedy Ann name on November 23, 1915.

==Early books and doll design==
&quot;Raggedy Ann Stories&quot; (1918), written and illustrated by Johnny Gruelle and published by the P. F. Volland Company, was the first in a series of books about his cloth doll character and her friends. The book&#x27;s first edition also included Gruelle&#x27;s own version of the doll&#x27;s origins and the related stories. Two years after the publication of the first Raggedy Ann book, Gruelle introduced Raggedy Ann&#x27;s brother, Raggedy Andy, in &quot;Raggedy Andy Stories&quot; (1920).

Although the female members of Gruelle&#x27;s family may have made a small number of initial versions of the Raggedy Ann doll in Norwalk, Connecticut, to help market the related books, Gruelle soon established a merchandising agreement with P. F. Volland Company, his primary publisher, to begin commercially manufacturing, selling, and promoting a mass-produced version of the doll.

In addition to his patent application in 1915 for the design of what became the Raggedy Ann doll, Gruelle patented his design for a generic male doll in 1920. A short time after its literary debut in 1920, Raggedy Andy appeared as a commercially made doll, marketed by Volland.

Following the success of the first Raggedy Ann book, Gruelle continued to author and illustrate at least one Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy story each year until his death in 1938. In addition to books Gruelle also wrote lyrics for musical compositions that were published as sheet music and songbooks for children. These works included &quot;Raggedy Ann&#x27;s Sunny Songs&quot; (1930) which was set to music by former U. S. Treasury Secretary William H. Woodin.

In his later years Gruelle collaborated with his son, Worth, on illustrations for some of his later books such as &quot;Raggedy Ann and the Golden Meadow&quot; (1935) and on a series of illustrated Raggedy Ann proverbs that were syndicated in newspapers. By 1938, the year that Johnny Gruelle died, his first Raggedy Ann book had sold more than 3 million copies.

Raggedy Ann doll sales were also growing. The P. F. Volland Company&#x27;s initial order of 24 dozen dolls from the Non-Breakable Toy Company, the doll&#x27;s early manufacturer, increased to about 3,200 dolls within the first eight months of production. With its growing popularity, Gruelle gave Volland the exclusive rights to manufacture and sell the dolls as long as it remained the exclusive publisher of his books.

==Legal challenges==
In 1935 Gruelle brought suit against Mollye Goldman (&quot;Gruelle vs. Goldman&quot;) after her company, Molly-&#x27;Es Doll Outfitters, continued to manufacture unauthorized versions of the Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls. Goldman&#x27;s attorney argued that Gruelle&#x27;s design patent for Raggedy Ann had expired in 1929, and Gruelle did not apply for a design patent or a trademark for a doll specifically named Raggedy Andy. The U.S. Patent office registered Goldman&#x27;s application for a trademark for her Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy dolls in 1935. Her patent application for her Raggedy Andy design was granted on May 7, 1935. Goldman&#x27;s versions of Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy closely resembled the Gruelle-designed rag dolls, which he had authorized the Exposition Doll and Toy Manufacturing Company to manufacture. Gruelle brought suit against Goldman for trademark infringement in October 1936, but the case was dismissed. He won the lawsuit on appeal in 1937. In the appellate court&#x27;s option handed down on December 23, 1937, Goldman&#x27;s company, Molly-&#x27;Es Doll Outfitters, could not legally manufacture dolls named Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy. Goldman was ordered to provide restitution to Gruelle.

Following Gruelle&#x27;s death in 1938, Myrtle (Swann) Gruelle, his widow, took further legal action to secure the rights to his works, trademarks, and patents, including those relating to Raggedy Ann and Andy. She also continued to promote Raggedy Ann and Andy, among Gruelle&#x27;s other literary characters, through the Johnny Gruelle Company, which also published the author&#x27;s books for several years. (P. F. Volland, his primary publisher, had discontinued its book publishing business during the Great Depression.)

==Legacy==
By the end of the 1940s, sales of Raggedy Ann-related books exceeded 7 million copies. The Indianapolis-based Bobbs-Merrill Company became the authorized publisher and licensor for Raggedy Ann-related literary works in 1962, and the Knickerbocker Toy Company began manufacturing the Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls in the early 1960s. Bobbs-Merrill eventually became part of Macmillan Inc. and later Simon &amp; Schuster, while Hasbro acquired Knickerbocker Toys. As such, Hasbro holds the trademark for the Raggedy Ann stuffed doll, while all other trademarks are claimed by Simon &amp; Schuster, at present a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. The original for the 1915 doll design, as well as the &quot;&quot; (1918) and &quot;&quot; (1920) books, are in the public domain, their copyrights having expired.

The Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy dolls and their related memorabilia have become sought-after collectors&#x27; items. In addition to the dolls and books, other related items continue to be produced including adaptations of the stories into comic books, audio recordings, animated films, and television and theatrical productions.

==Honors and tributes==
The Raggedy Ann doll was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in Rochester, New York, on March 27, 2002. Raggedy Andy was inducted 5 years later on November 8, 2007.

==Related books==
Johnny Gruelle, Raggedy Ann&#x27;s creator, authored and/or illustrated dozens of related works. Many other books were released and in some cases credited to Gruelle after his death in 1938. In addition, numerous works have been written or illustrated by others such as Ethel Hays, who illustrated most of the Saalfield Publishing Company&#x27;s Raggedy Ann-related stories published from 1944.

===Doll production===
Although the female members of Gruelle&#x27;s family may have originally handmade a few of the versions of the Raggedy Ann doll in Norwalk, Connecticut, to help market the related books, Gruelle soon established a merchandising agreement with P. F. Volland Company, the primary publisher of his books, to manufacture, sell, and promote a mass-produced, commercial version of the Raggedy Ann doll. Early Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls were manufactured by different companies and not produced as matched sets.

Between 1918 and 1926, the Non-Breakable Toy Company of Muskegon, Michigan made more than 75,000 dolls for Volland. By the late 1920s Volland&#x27;s orders for Raggedy Ann dolls from its manufacturer had reached 4,000 per month. When Volland ceased operations during the Great Depression it had already sold more than 150,000 dolls and nearly 2 million Raggedy Ann books.

In 1935, Gruelle granted permission to the Exposition Doll and Toy Manufacturing Company to manufacture and sell authorized versions of the Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls. From 1935 until 1937 Molly-&#x27;Es Doll Outfitters manufactured and sold unauthorized versions of the Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls until a legal decision handed down in &quot;Gruelle v (Mollye) Goldman&quot; prohibited Molly-&#x27;Es Dolls from further manufacturing and sales of the dolls.

* In the original 1971 version of the Peter Pan&#x27;s Flight attraction at the Magic Kingdom, a pair of Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls could be seen having a tea party at the very start of the attraction. The small scene remained until around 2018-2019, where it was replaced with a chair and a generic doll.
* In John Carpenter’s 1978 slasher film, Halloween, a Raggedy Ann doll appears in Laurie Strode’s room during the scene where Laurie gets a call from her friend.

<text>Commandos is the special forces formation of the Singapore Army responsible for conducting special operations. Commandos are tasked with infiltrating behind enemy lines by raiding and reconnaissance operations using airborne raids, helicopter assault and sea landings. The formation is made up of only one battalion, the 1st Commando Battalion (1 CDO BN), and is based in Hendon Camp.

==History==
The Commandos formation traces its origin to 1967 when two officers, Major Clarence Tan and Major James Chia, were tasked with recruiting eligible candidates from any unit within the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to form an elite unit. On 1 December 1969, ten officers and 20 men, all regulars, came together to form a unit called the Regular Battalion. Captain Tham Chee Onn was initially the acting commanding officer until Major Clarence Tan subsequently joined the unit, became its commanding officer, and established a training programme for the unit. A second recruitment drive was launched in early 1970 to increase the number of officers in the unit.

On 3 May 1971, the battalion introduced the red beret for its soldiers, and it was renamed 1st Commando Battalion (1 CDO BN) on 16 July 1971. The battalion had only one company at the time. After the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) allowed Full-Time National Servicemen (NSFs) to join the 1 CDO BN in 1972, a second company was formed on 15 January 1973 from the first batch of conscripts enlisted in the Commandos. From July 1973 to January 1975, three more companies were created. In April 1975, 1 CDO BN was restructured and placed under the command of the 3rd Division (3 DIV). In 1977, 1 CDO BN and two Guards battalions came under the command of the 7th Singapore Infantry Brigade (7 SIB), and they received the state and regimental colours on 22 January 1977 from Minister for Defence Goh Keng Swee.

On 1 July 1980, 1 CDO BN was placed under the command of HQ Infantry. On 1 October that year, the School of Commando Training was established to take charge of 1 CDO BN. Brigadier-General Tan Chin Tiong, acting Chief of the General Staff, presented the 1 CDO BN with its current formation logo, which incorporates a winged stiletto denoting their airborne status, as well as the formation&#x27;s motto, &quot;For Honour and Glory&quot;. On 17 December 1984, the first company, which used to comprise only regulars, started taking in conscripts and training for long-range reconnaissance patrol and divisional disruptive operations. In December 1986, a new Commando tradition started when a stiletto (Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife) was presented to every Commando of the second company during the ceremony when they received their red berets. Since then, every Commando has received a stiletto after completing two years of service in the battalion.

In 1989, HQ Commandos was established and it received its state and formation colours from President Wee Kim Wee on 20 October 1991. On 27 January 1994, Lieutenant-General Ng Jui Ping, Chief of Defence Force, officially opened Hendon Camp, which has since been the base of the Commando formation. Since 1992, the 1 CDO BN has organised an annual Commando Skills-at-Arms Meet, involving the Commandos competing in various skills such as marksmanship, demolition and completion of the standard obstacle course in full battle order.

In 2005, a sixth company was formed in the 1 CDO BN. It was reported that some Commandos had been deployed to the War in Afghanistan as part of the SAF&#x27;s Operation Blue Ridge between 2007 and 2013.

==Selection and training==
The selection process for Commandos is stringent. Potential candidates are screened during the pre-National Service check-up before they enlist in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Shortlisted candidates undergo further tests, security clearance checks, among other things, as well as a panel interview, before they are directly enlisted into one of the 1st Commando Battalion&#x27;s companies.

===Basic Military Training===
All newly enlisted recruits undergo Basic Military Training (BMT) at the Commando Training Institute in Pasir Ris Camp. Upon completing BMT, they proceed for vocational training in specific roles, such as signaller, combat medic, weapons specialist, sniper, small boat operator, and demolition expert. Outstanding trainees who have demonstrated leadership potential may be sent for further training to be specialists or officers.

===Basic Airborne Course===
All trainees need to pass the Basic Airborne Course conducted by the Parachute Training Wing to earn the parachutist badge. After completing the basic airborne course, trainees undergo company-level training at Hendon Camp and an overseas training course in Brunei. To mark the end of nine months of training, they go for a route march before attending a ceremony in Hendon Camp to receive their red berets. The Commandos will continue training extensively in battalion-level operations, rappelling, fast-roping, small boat operations, and other advanced tactics.

Commando reservists are routinely called up for in-camp training after completing their full-time national service and are required to achieve standards higher than their non-Commando counterparts when they take the Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) every year.

===School of Commandos===
The School of Commandos has two training wings: the Commando Training Wing which conducts the &quot;&quot;Singapore Armed Forces Ranger Course&quot; (SAF RC) and the Parachute Training Wing which conducts the &quot;Basic Airborne Course&quot;&quot; (BAC).

The Commando Training Wing, established in 1974, conducts the Commando Section Leaders&#x27; Course, the Commando Small Boat Operators&#x27; Course, the Commando Officer Conversion Course, and the Singapore Armed Forces Ranger Course. The Commando Section Leaders&#x27; Course trains selected Commandos to become specialists, serving as section leaders. The best performing trainees are selected to undergo further training at the Officer Cadet School (OCS) at the SAFTI Military Institute. After they are commissioned, they return to the Commando Training Wing to attend the Commando Officer Conversion Course to be trained as platoon commanders.

&quot;Singapore Armed Forces Ranger Course&quot; (SAF RC), 65 days long, is the toughest small unit leadership course in the SAF, with intense combat leadership training focused on small-unit-tactics. First conducted in 1978, it is now conducted annually at Pasir Ris Camp with a limited number of slots open for application to not only Commandos, but also eligible regulars from other formations. Commando regulars have to enrol in the course and, upon completion of the course, they may be recommended to attend the United States Army&#x27;s Ranger School.

&quot;Basic Airborne Course&quot; (BAC) covers the static line jumps. The Parachute Training Wing was established in 1974 as the Parachute Training School and started out with instructors trained in the United States and New Zealand. It completed training the first batch of Commandos on 19 October 1974 and subsequently started taking in non-Commando trainees as well. It conducts the Basic Airborne Course for about 120 to 160 trainees per class, as well as more advanced courses such as the Parachute Jump Instructor Course and the Military Free Fall Course.

==Known Operations==
;Laju ferry hijacking
On 1 January 1974, four terrorists from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and Japanese Red Army attacked an oil refinery on Pulau Bukom and hijacked the ferry &quot;Laju&quot; and took five hostages. After negotiations with the Singapore Government, the terrorists freed the hostages on 8 February 1974 and boarded a flight to Kuwait. They were escorted by 13 men, of which four were Commandos.

;Operation Thunderstorm 
On 8 May 1975, the Commandos and the Navy stormed several vessels carrying Vietnamese refugees intruding into Singapore waters. They kept watch on the refugees and the crews until they were resupplied and escorted out of Singapore about two days later.

;Operation Thunderbolt
On 26 March 1991, Singapore Airlines Flight 117 was hijacked by four Pakistani militants, who took all 129 people on board hostage. When the plane landed at Changi Airport, an unknown number of Commandos from the Special Operations Force (SOF) stormed the plane, killed the four hijackers and freed the hostages within five minutes. The Commandos were awarded the Medal of Valour for their achievement.

;United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia
Commandos were deployed as peacekeepers alongside Super Puma helicopters.

;Operation Blue Heron
Commandos were deployed as peacekeepers to East Timor from May 2001 to November 2002 while having small arms.

;Operation Blue Orchid
Commandos deployed to Iraq from 2002 to 2008 to protect Singaporean Air Force aircraft and crew providing humanitarian relief and transporting essential supplies.

;Operation Flying Eagle
Commandos were deployed in Aceh to ensure safety of SAF forces providing humanitarian relief.

;Operation Blue Ridge
Commandos were deployed alongside regular SAF forces from 2007 to 2013 for protection and support operations.

==Accidents and controversies==
The Commandos have won the Singapore Armed Forces&#x27; annual Best Combat Unit competition many times since 1969. However, in 2003, 1 CDO BN was barred from the competition after it was found guilty of doctoring score-keeping records and fitness test results.

Serious accidents during training are rare and were hardly, or probably never, publicised in the media until 2003, when the Singapore Armed Forces&#x27; standards of safety in training came under increased scrutiny following the deaths of some servicemen during training.

On 21 August 2003, a Guardsman, Second Sergeant Hu Enhuai, died during a combat survival training course conducted by the Commandos. Four Commandos were charged in court a year later for carrying out the &quot;dunking&quot; procedure deemed inappropriate for training purposes. On 3 September 2003, another Guardsman, Second Sergeant Rajagopal Thirukumaran, died after a run during the selection process for the Ranger Course conducted by the Commando Training Wing.

On 15 June 2005, Second Sergeant Ong Jia Hui, a member of the Maritime Counter-Terrorism Group, drowned during training at Changi Naval Base. On 13 July 2005, First Sergeant Shiva s/o Mohan fell from 20 metres above the ground while rappelling from a helicopter and was pronounced dead in hospital about two hours later.

On 20 June 2006, Lieutenant Lionel Lin died after encountering difficulties while training at the swimming pool in Hendon Camp.

On 13 March 2010, First Sergeant Woo Teng Hai was accidentally shot by a villager during overseas training in Thailand. He was flown back to Singapore on the same day and was discharged from hospital by the end of that month.

<text>John Barton Gruelle (December 24, 1880 – January 9, 1938) was an American artist, political cartoonist, children&#x27;s book and comics author, illustrator, and storyteller. He is best known as the creator of Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy dolls and as the author/illustrator of dozens of books. He also created the Beloved Belindy doll. Gruelle also contributed cartoons and illustrations to at least ten newspapers, four major news syndicates, and more than a dozen national magazines. He was the son of Hoosier Group painter Richard Gruelle.

==Early life and education==
Gruelle was born in Arcola, Illinois, on December 24, 1880, to Alice (Benton) and Richard Buckner Gruelle. In 1882, when Gruelle was two years old, he moved with his parents to Indianapolis, Indiana, and settled in a home on Tacoma Avenue in what is the present-day Lockerbie Square Historic District. The Gruelles made Indianapolis their home for more than twenty-five years.

John was exposed to art and literature at an early age. His father, Richard, who was a self-taught portrait and landscape painter who became associated with the Hoosier Group of American Impressionist painters. In addition to Richard Gruelle, the informal group included William Forsyth, T. C. Steele, Otto Stark, and J. Ottis Adams. Another Gruelle family friends was Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, whose poems &quot;The Elf-Child,&quot; later titled &quot;Little Orphant Annie&quot; (1885), and &quot;The Raggedy Man&quot; (1888), eventually formed the name for John Gruelle&#x27;s iconic Raggedy Ann character. Gruelle later honored Riley&#x27;s memory in his own book, &quot;The Orphant Annie Story Book&quot; (1921), written in tribute to Riley&#x27;s famous poem.

John was the eldest child of the Gruelle family, which also included a younger sister, Prudence (1884–1966), and a brother, Justin (1889–1979). Gruelle&#x27;s parents exposed all three children to music, literature, and art. John, who likely attended public schools in Indianapolis as a youth, became interested in art, and learned drawing from his father. Prudence trained as a vocalist in New York City, performed in vaudeville theaters, and married Albert Matzke, an illustrator and watercolorist. She also became an author of children&#x27;s books and a syndicated newspaper columnist. Justin studied art in Indianapolis and New York City and became a landscape painter, illustrator, and muralist.

==Marriage and family==
Nineteen-year-old Gruelle met his future wife, Myrtle J. Swann, in Indianapolis, where they were married on March 23, 1901. Marcella, the first of their three children, was born on August 18, 1902, and died on November 8, 1915, at age 13. The Gruelles also had two sons, Worth, who became an artist and illustrator, and Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Gruelle. Gruelle&#x27;s widow, Myrtle (Swann) Gruelle Silsby, who remarried for a brief period in 1945, died on April 25, 1968, at the age of eighty-three.

John and Myrtle Gruelle began their married life in Indianapolis and moved with their young daughter to Cleveland, Ohio. By 1910 they had left Cleveland and moved to the Norwalk, Connecticut, area, where Gruelle&#x27;s parents had acquired a property in Silvermine, a present-day historic district and art colony along the Silvermine River comprising sections of Norwalk, New Canaan, and Wilton, Connecticut. Gruelle and his family initially lived in a studio maintained by his father and brother on the former site of the Blanchard Fur Factory until they built a home in the Wilton section of Silvermine. Gruelle&#x27;s parents, his sister and her husband, and his younger brother also made their home in the Silvermine area. After the death of their daughter, Marcella, in 1915 from an infected smallpox vaccine, John and Myrtle Gruelle moved with their two sons to Norwalk. In addition to being closer to his family, Gruelle&#x27;s relocation to the East Coast provided him with additional opportunities for freelance work in newspapers and magazines as an artist and journalist.

Gruelle also spent a year in Ashland, Oregon, from 1923 to 1924.

==Career==
Gruelle began his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Indianapolis newspapers. His work was eventually syndicated nationwide. He also completed commissions for illustrations of well-known fairy tales, as well as writing and illustrating his own stories. Gruelle is best known as the creator of a series of stories about a rag doll named Raggedy Ann and her friends. He also created the iconic Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy dolls. In addition to becoming a successful commercial artist and illustrator, cartoonist, writer, and businessman, Gruelle was a nature-lover, storyteller, and spiritualist.

===Early years===

In the early years of his career Gruelle created political cartoons and single-frame sports comics that appeared in Indianapolis newspapers such as the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; and the &quot;Indianapolis Daily Sentinel&quot;. In 1903 he became assistant illustrator for the &quot;Star&quot;. Within a few months his political cartoons of a top-hatted crow began to appear on the front page of the &quot;Star&quot; with witty comments for the day. Gruelle&#x27;s crow figure also became the &quot;Star&quot;&#x27;s weather bird and continued to appear on the newspaper&#x27;s front page even after Gruelle&#x27;s death in 1938. (The bird was initially named &quot;Jim Crow,&quot; but it was renamed &quot;Joe Crow&quot; in the 1950s.)

From 1906 to 1911, his cartoons, usually signed as &quot;Grue&quot;, appeared in other city newspapers, such as &quot;The Toledo News-Bee&quot;, the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot;, the &quot;Tacoma Times&quot;, the &quot;Spokane Press&quot;, and the &quot;Cleveland Press&quot;. Gruelle&#x27;s big break came in 1910–1911, when his two entries for a full-page, comic-drawing contest sponsored by the &quot;New York Herald&quot; won first and second place among the submissions from 1,500 entrants. His first-place entry, &quot;Mr. Twee Deedle&quot;, was syndicated in weekly installments nationwide until 1918.

As Gruelle earned notoriety as a cartoonist for the &quot;Herald&quot;, he also pursued writing and illustrating his own fairy tales. His first major illustrating commission was a single-volume edition of &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales&quot; (1914) that included Gruelle&#x27;s artwork for eleven full-color plates. In other early commission work he illustrated and retold other fairy tales that included the stories of &quot;Cinderella,&quot; &quot;Little Red Riding Hood,&quot; and &quot;Hansel and Gretel,&quot; among others. He also wrote and illustrated &quot;My Very Own Fairy Stories&quot; (1917), published by P. F. Volland Company, a publisher of inspirational cards, gifts, and books. Beginning with these early stories, Gruelle typically used a &quot;fairy-story-with-a-moral format&quot; to teach the ethical lessons that became a trademark of his work. Gruelle also created a cartoon series in 1917 called &quot;Quacky Doodles&quot;, produced as part of Bray Productions&#x27; weekly &quot;Paramount Pictograph&quot; productions.

===Creator of Raggedy Ann===

The exact details of the origins of the Raggedy Ann doll and related stories are uncertain. Gruelle biographer Patricia Hall notes that according to an oft-repeated myth, Gruelle&#x27;s daughter, Marcella, brought from her grandmother&#x27;s attic a faceless rag doll on which the artist drew a face, and that Gruelle suggested that Marcella&#x27;s grandmother sew a shoe button for a missing eye. Hall says the date of this supposed occurrence is given as early as 1900 and as late as 1914, with the locale variously given as suburban Indianapolis, Indiana, downtown Cleveland, Ohio, or Wilton, Connecticut. More likely, as Gruelle&#x27;s wife, Myrtle, told Hall, Gruelle retrieved a long-forgotten, homemade rag doll from the attic of his parents&#x27; Indianapolis home sometime around the turn of the 20th century, a few years before the couple&#x27;s daughter was born. As Myrtle Gruelle recalled, &quot;There was something he wanted from the attic. While he was rummaging around for it, he found an old rag doll his mother had made for his sister. He said then that the doll would make a good story.&quot; She further explained that her husband &quot;kept [the doll] in his mind until we had Marcella. He remembered it when he saw her play [with] dolls... He wrote the stories around some of the things she did. He used to get ideas from watching her.&quot;

Hall notes another unproven legend states that Gruelle began writing and illustrating the Raggedy Ann stories while his daughter was gravely ill from complications resulting from an infected vaccination, and her death at age 13 inspired him to publish the stories and create the rag doll as a tribute to her memory. Another version of the doll&#x27;s origins suggests that it appeared as a character in an illustrated poem in one of Gruelle&#x27;s earlier books. Some journalistic sources have continued to repeat the various myths and legends.

A few of the details about the Raggedy Ann doll and its origins are documented. On September 7, 1915, the U.S. Patent Office approved , Gruelle&#x27;s May 28, 1915, patent application for the design of the prototype that became the Raggedy Ann doll. Gruelle&#x27;s patent application for the doll&#x27;s design was already in progress around the time that his daughter, Marcella, became ill. The artist received final approval for the U.S. patent the same month as her death. On June 17, 1915, Gruelle applied for a trademark logo for the Raggedy Ann name, which he formed from a combination of names from two James Whitcomb Riley poems, &quot;The Raggedy Man&quot; and &quot;Little Orphant Annie.&quot; The P. F. Volland Company published Gruelle&#x27;s &quot;Raggedy Ann Stories&quot; (1918), the first in a series of books about his Raggedy Ann rag-doll character and her friends. Both became major successes. The book&#x27;s first edition also included Gruelle&#x27;s own version of the doll&#x27;s origins and the related stories.

Although the female members of Gruelle&#x27;s family may have made initial versions of the Raggedy Ann doll in Norwalk, Connecticut, to help market the related books, Gruelle soon established a merchandising agreement with P. F. Volland Company, his primary publisher, to begin manufacturing, selling, and promoting a mass-produced version of the doll. Raggedy Ann books and dolls became major successes. Two years later Gruelle introduced Raggedy Ann&#x27;s brother, the mischievous and adventuresome Raggedy Andy, in &quot;Raggedy Andy Stories&quot; (1920). Gruelle also patented his design for a generic male doll (). A short time after its literary debut, Raggedy Andy appeared as a Volland-made doll. Gruelle was also awarded design patents for two duck toys in 1915. is based on his character &quot;Quacky Doodles&quot; and is based on his character &quot;Danny Daddles.&quot; In addition, Gruelle applied for a stuffed elephant toy () in 1920 and a stuffed bear toy () in 1921.

===Other projects===
In addition to the Raggedy Ann books, Gruelle continued to write and illustrate other works for children that included &quot;Friendly Stories&quot; (1919), another volume of his fairy stories. During the 1920s and 1930s he wrote and illustrated &quot;The Magical Land of Noom&quot; (1922), published by P. F. Volland Company, and the &quot;Orphant Annie Story Book&quot; (1921) and &quot;Johnny Mouse and the Wishing Stick&quot; (1922) for Indianapolis-based publisher Bobbs-Merrill Company. (Bobbs-Merrill became the authorized publisher and licensor for Raggedy Ann-related literary works in 1962.) The success of Gruelle&#x27;s early books launched his career as a children&#x27;s author/illustrator. While continuing to work on commissions for newspapers and magazines, he authored and illustrated at least one Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy story each year.

On November 27, 1929, the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate launched &quot;Brutus,&quot; a domestic-comedy comic strip with elements of fantasy. Gruelle continued to work on this comic strip until his death in 1938.

Gruelle also wrote lyrics for musical compositions that were published as sheet music and songbooks for children. His lyrics in &quot;Raggedy Ann&#x27;s Sunny Songs&quot; (1930) was set to music by William H. Woodin, a former U. S. Treasury Secretary. (It is likely that one of Gruelle&#x27;s characters, &quot;Little Wooden Willie,&quot; was named for the politician.) Other sheet music included &quot;Beyond the Moon&quot; (1931) with lyrics by Gruelle and Johnny Mercer, music by Guy Stevens; and &quot;Beneath the Southern Skies&quot; (1931) with lyrics by Gruelle and Joan Jasmyn, music by M. K. Jerome. Other Gruelle children&#x27;s songbooks and recordings include the Richard Wolfe Children&#x27;s Chorus performing on a recording of &quot;A Raggedy Ann Songbook&quot; (1996).

==Later years==
Gruelle and his wife relocated from Connecticut, to the Miami, Florida, area in 1932. In his later years Gruelle continued to write and illustrate books such as &quot;Raggedy Ann and the Golden Meadow&quot; (1935), which was completed with the assistance of his son, Worth. The father-and-son duo also collaborated on a series of illustrated Raggedy Ann proverbs that were syndicated in newspapers. In addition, Gruelle produced humorous cartoons and made public appearances, but took time away from work to pursue his hobby of collecting automobiles. Although the Great Depression of the 1930s caused some setbacks that included the bankruptcy of his primary publisher, P. F. Volland, and a lawsuit for patent and trademark infringement that he finally won on appeal in 1937, Gruelle and his family continued to experience an active life in Florida until stress took its toll on Gruelle&#x27;s health.

==Death and legacy==
He died unexpectedly of heart failure at his son Worth&#x27;s home in Miami Springs, Florida, on January 9, 1938, two weeks after his fifty-seventh birthday. Following Gruelle&#x27;s death, his widow, Myrtle (Swann) Gruelle, took legal action to secure the rights to his works, trademarks, and patents. She also continued her efforts to promote his legacy through the Johnny Gruelle Company, the Bobbs-Merrill Company, and other commercial agreements.

In a career that spanned forty years, Gruelle was an author and/or illustrator of dozens of books and contributed cartoons and illustrations to at least ten newspapers, four major new syndicates, and more than a dozen national magazines. Despite the diversity of his work, Gruelle is best known as the illustrator, author, and the creator of the Raggedy Ann doll and related books, illustrations, and characters. By the time of his death in 1938, his first Raggedy Ann book had sold more than 3 million copies. The iconic Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy dolls that Gruelle designed and their related memorabilia have become sought-after collectors&#x27; items.

Gruelle also left a legacy of other artistic and literary works. Although he was inspired by many sources and most of his work was based on traditional European folktales, Gruelle developed his own storytelling style. Many of his stories for children included parables about the virtues of &quot;sharing, compassion, and telling the truth.&quot; In addition to his prose, Gruelle used his illustrations to tell stories of magical lands, fanciful animals, and memorable characters, especially Raggedy Ann, Raggedy Andy, and their friends. While his early artwork used a romantic, dreamlike style that frequently included the gold-and-violet palette of his father, among other American Impressionists, Gruelle&#x27;s later illustrations used a brighter color palette. Animation historian Donald Crafton described Gruelle&#x27;s illustrations as having a typically &quot;clean, curvilinear style that looks ahead to the Disney graphics of the 1930s.&quot;

Cartoonists such as Sidney Smith, Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss), and Mary Engelbreit have named Gruelle among those who have inspired their work. Gruelle&#x27;s own creative work continues through the ongoing production of the Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy dolls and related items, numerous reprints of Gruelle&#x27;s books, and adaptions of his work that includes numerous comic books, audio recordings, animated films, theatrical scripts and screenplays.

==Honors and tributes==
* Gruelle&#x27;s Raggedy Ann doll was inducted into National Toy Hall of Fame in Rochester, New York, in 2002; Raggedy Andy was inducted in 2007.

<text>Edinburgh College of Art (ECA) is one of eleven schools in the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Edinburgh. Tracing its history back to 1760, it provides higher education in art and design, architecture, history of art, and music disciplines for over three thousand students and is at the forefront of research and research-led teaching in the creative arts, humanities, and creative technologies. ECA comprises five subject areas: School of Art, Reid School of Music, School of Design, School of History of Art, and Edinburgh School of Architecture &amp; Landscape Architecture (ESALA). ECA is mainly located in the Old Town of Edinburgh, overlooking the Grassmarket; the Lauriston Place campus is located in the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s Central Area Campus, not far from George Square.

The college was founded in 1760, and gained its present name and site in 1907. Formerly associated with Heriot-Watt University, its degrees have been issued by the University of Edinburgh since 2004. The college formally merged with the university on 1 August 2011, combining with the School of Arts, Culture and Environment and continues to exist with the name Edinburgh College of Art as an enlarged school in the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.

==History==
Edinburgh College of Art (ECA) can trace its history back to 1760, when the Trustees Drawing Academy of Edinburgh was established by the Board of Trustees for Fisheries, Manufactures and Improvements in Scotland. This board had been set up by Act of Parliament in 1727 to &quot;encourage and promote the fisheries or such other manufactures and improvements in Scotland as may most conduce to the general good of the United Kingdom&quot;. The aim of the academy was to train designers for the manufacturing industries. Drawing and the design of patterns for the textile industries were taught at the Academy&#x27;s rooms at Picardy Place.

The board was responsible for the construction of the Royal Institution (named for the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland), now the Royal Scottish Academy building, on The Mound and also commissioned the Scottish National Portrait Gallery on Queen Street. From 1826, classes were held at the Royal Institution building. The master of the school was always a fine artist, the first being French painter William Delacour. Subsequent masters included Alexander Runciman and David Allan. The academy&#x27;s focus gradually shifted from applied arts to encompass fine art, and the school gained a reputation for excellence in both painting and design. Scottish artists who were trained at the Academy include John Brown, Alexander Nasmyth and Andrew Wilson.

In 1858, the academy was affiliated to the Science and Art Department in London, known as the &quot;South Kensington system&quot;, under which it became the Government School of Art for the city of Edinburgh. A School of Applied Art was also established under this system. The Drawing School became part of a system of schools managed on similar lines, and distinctive teaching practices were lost. In 1903 it amalgamated with the School of Applied Art. In 1907, the Scottish Education Department took over responsibility for the school, and it became Edinburgh College of Art.

ECA was officially recognised by the Scottish Government as a Small Specialist Institution for the teaching of art, design and architecture prior to the merger with University of Edinburgh in 2011. From 1968 it was associated with Heriot-Watt University for degree awarding purposes but the validation agreement with Heriot-Watt University was due to end in 2012. In 2004 ECA partnered with the University of Edinburgh for degree awarding purposes, an Academic Federation Agreement to facilitate closer collaboration was put in place between the two institutions in 2007 and they merged in 2011. At the time the merger plan was announced in January 2011, Scottish Government Education Secretary Mike Russell criticised the financial management of ECA.

The joint Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (ESALA) formed in August 2009 as a joint venture between ECA and the University of Edinburgh.

The first professorship in an ECA subject area was the Reid Professor of Music, which was created in 1839, with the first holder being Scottish composer John Thomson who conducted the first Reid concert in 1841. The Watson Gordon Chair of Fine Art founded some forty years later, the first of its kind in the British Isles and a turning point in the teaching of the History of Art.

In 2005, the College joined with Edinburgh Napier University to launch the Screen Academy Scotland, a new centre of excellence in film learning and education.

==College buildings==

With the creation of Edinburgh College of Art in 1907, the institution moved to new premises on Lady Lawson Street. Formerly a cattle market, the site lies above the Grassmarket and opposite Edinburgh Castle. The red sandstone main building was designed in the Beaux-Arts style by John Wilson while working for John More Dick Peddie and George Washington Browne, and was completed in 1909. The main building was listed Category A in 1970. Inside, the Sculpture Court displays casts of the Elgin Marbles and other antique statuary, alongside changing displays of contemporary student&#x27;s work.

The Architecture Building was added to the east end of the college in 1961, designed by architect Ralph Cowan, who was a Professor of Architecture at the college. In 1977 the Lauriston Campus was expanded with the addition of the Hunter Building. This L-shaped red sandstone block, designed by Anthony Wheeler in 1971, encloses the college courtyard and fronts Lauriston Place to the south. In the 1990s the college took over a separate group of buildings in the Grassmarket, for use as a library and teaching space, and also took over the former Salvation Army building on West Port. These buildings in the Grassmarket and West Port were disposed of after the College purchased Evolution House.

The nine-storey Evolution House on West Port by Reiach and Hall Architects was completed 2003, adjacent to the main College building. Built as speculative offices, it now houses the art and design library, as well as providing design studios and office facilities for the School of Design. While the college remains mainly concentrated on the Lauriston Place Campus, as a result of the merger with the University of Edinburgh in August 2011, the new enlarged ECA incorporated Minto House on Chambers Street (part of ESALA) and Alison House in Nicolson Square (Reid School of Music). In 2017, the Lauriston Campus expanded to include the former Lothian &amp; Borders Fire &amp; Rescue Service Headquarters, formerly housing the&#x27;Museum of Fire&#x27;, Building (arch. Robert Morham, 1897–1901).

The Wee Red Bar serves as the student union bar, and acts as a year-round venue for gigs and theatre shows, and also acts a venue during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe

<text>Places of interest in the [[Death Valley]] area are mostly located within Death Valley National Park in eastern California.

==Aguereberry Point==
Aguereberry Point is a promontory and tourist viewpoint in the Panamint Range, within Death Valley National Park in Inyo County, eastern California.

The point&#x27;s elevation reaches 6,433 ft and is named for Jean Pierre &quot;Pete&quot; Aguereberry, a Basque miner who was born in 1874, emigrated from France in 1890, and lived at and worked the nearby Eureka Mine from 1905 to his death in 1945.

From this viewpoint, one can see the surrounding Panamint Range extending to the north and south; Death Valley to the east, with Furnace Creek and the salt flats of Badwater Basin to the southeast; and Mount Charleston in Nevada far to the east.

==Amargosa Chaos==

The Amargosa Chaos is a series of geological formations located in the Black Mountains in southern Death Valley. In the 1930s, geologist Levi F. Noble studied the faulting and folding in the area, dubbing it the &quot;Amargosa chaos&quot; due to the extreme warping of the rock. Later researchers discovered that the region had experienced substantial tension that pulled large blocks of crust apart.

Modern geologists have documented four major deformational events that faulted and folded the Amargosa Chaos. The first event metamorphosed Death Valley&#x27;s Precambrian basement rocks and occurred around 1,700 million years ago.

The second event began while layered younger Precambrian sediments were being deposited on top of the beveled surface of older metamorphic basement rocks. This deformational event shifted the crust vertically, creating thinning and thickening of some sedimentary layers as they were being deposited.

The two events responsible for the chaotic appearance of the Amargosa Chaos did not occur until over half a billion years later, during Mesozoic or Early Tertiary time. This third event folded the layered Precambrian and Cambrian sedimentary rocks.

The fourth and final event occurred quite recently, geologically speaking. This phase of deformation coincided with severe crustal stretching that created the deep valleys and high mountains of this part of the Basin and Range Province. In just a few million years, during Late Miocene to Pliocene time, older rocks were intensely faulted and sheared. In some areas all that remains of some thick rock layers are lens-shaped pods of rock bounded on all sides by faults. Other layers have been sliced out of their original sequence altogether.

==Artist&#x27;s Drive and Palette==

Artist&#x27;s Drive rises up to the top of an alluvial fan fed by a deep canyon cut into the Black Mountains. Artist&#x27;s Palette is an area on the face of the Black Mountains noted for a variety of rock colors. These colors are caused by the oxidation of different metals (iron compounds produce red, pink and yellow, decomposition of tuff-derived mica produces green, and manganese produces purple).

Called the Artist Drive Formation, the rock unit provides evidence for one of the Death Valley area&#x27;s most violently explosive volcanic periods. The Miocene-aged formation is made up of cemented gravel, playa deposits, and volcanic debris, perhaps thick. Chemical weathering and hydrothermal alteration cause the oxidation and other chemical reactions that produce the variety of colors displayed in the Artist Drive Formation and nearby exposures of the Furnace Creek Formation.
==Badwater Basin==
The Badwater Basin is a salt flat adjacent to the Black Mountains that descends to the lowest elevation in North America at below sea level. The massive expanse of white is made up of almost pure table salt. The basin is the second lowest depression in the Western Hemisphere, eclipsed only by Laguna del Carbón in Argentina at .

This pan was first created by the drying-up of deep Recent Lake 2000 to 3000 years ago. Unlike at the Devils Golf Course, significant rainstorms flood Badwater, covering the salt pan with a thin sheet of standing water. Each newly formed lake doesn&#x27;t last long though, because the average rainfall is overwhelmed by a annual evaporation rate. This, the nation&#x27;s greatest evaporation potential, means that even a deep, long lake would dry up in a single year. While flooded, some of the salt is dissolved, then is redeposited as clean, sparkling crystals when the water evaporates.

==Charcoal Kilns==
The Wildrose Charcoal Kilns were completed in 1877 by the Modock Consolidated Mining Company, above Death Valley in the Panamint Range, and were used to reduce pinyon and juniper tree wood to charcoal in a process of slow burning in low oxygen. This fuel was then transported to mines in The Argus Range, 25 miles to the west, to feed smelting and ore extraction operations.

Although the mines themselves were worked intermittently until about 1900, there is no clear evidence that the charcoal kilns were operational after 1879. They were restored by Navajo Indian stonemasons from Arizona in 1971.

The kilns were located here as the trees single-leaf pinyon pine &quot;(Pinus monophylla)&quot; and Utah juniper (&quot;Juniperus osteosperma)&quot; dominate the landscape in the upper Panamint Mountains. Shrubs of Mormon tea &quot;(Ephedra sp.)&quot;, such as Death Valley ephedra &quot;(Ephedra funerea)&quot;, are spaced between them, with other xeric sub-shrubs and native bunchgrasses.

Other historic charcoal kilns in the United States include the Cottonwood Charcoal Kilns at Owens Lake, the Piedmont Charcoal Kilns in Wyoming, and the Walker Charcoal Kiln in Arizona.

Wildrose Canyon has 2 campgrounds above the kilns, Thorndyke at 7,490 feet and Mahogany Flat at 7923 feet. The latter is the trail head for the hiking trail to Telescope Peak and has views to the east down to Badwater.

==Dante&#x27;s View==

From Dante&#x27;s View one can see the central part of Death Valley from a vantage point above sea level. From here Badwater Basin can be seen, which 
contains the lowest dry point in North America. Telescope Peak can also be seen from here which is above sea level. This is the greatest topographic relief in the conterminous U.S.

The mountain that Dante&#x27;s View is on is part of the Black Mountains which along with the parallel Panamint Range across the valley from what geologists call a horst and the valley that is called a graben. These structures are created when the surface of the earth is under extensional, or a pulling force. The crust responds to this force by sending a large and long roughly v-shaped block of crust down which forms the bedrock of the valley floor (see Basin and Range).

==Darwin Falls==

Darwin Falls is a waterfall located on the western edge of Death Valley National Park near the settlement of Panamint Springs, California. There are several falls, but they are mainly divided into the upper and lower with a small grotto in between. The small, narrow valley where the creek and falls are located features a rare collection of riparian greenery in the vast desert and is home to indigenous fauna such as quail. The falls themselves support several small fern gullys.

== Devil&#x27;s Golf Course ==
The Devil&#x27;s Golf Course is a large salt pan on the floor of Death Valley. It was named after a line in the 1934 National Park Service guide book to Death Valley National Monument, which stated that &quot;Only the devil could play golf&quot; on its surface, due to a rough texture from the large halite salt crystal formations.

Lake Manly once covered the valley to a depth of . The salt in the Devil&#x27;s Golf Course consists of the minerals that were dissolved in the lake&#x27;s water and left behind in the Badwater Basin when the lake evaporated. With an elevation several feet above the valley floor at Badwater, the Devil&#x27;s Golf Course remains dry, allowing weathering processes to sculpt the salt there into complicated formations.

Through exploratory holes drilled by the Pacific Coast Borax Company, prior to Death Valley becoming a national monument in 1934, it was discovered that the salt and gravel beds of the Devil&#x27;s Golf Course extend to a depth of more than . Later studies suggest that in places the depth ranges up to .

Devil&#x27;s Golf Course can be reached from Badwater Road via a gravel drive, closed in wet weather. It should not be confused with an actual golf course in Furnace Creek, also in Death Valley.

==Eureka Valley and Sand Dunes==

Between the Last Chance Range and Saline Mountains is the graben Eureka Valley. Sand dunes cover 3 square miles (8 km2) of Eureka Valley, rising 680 feet (207 m) as one of North America&#x27;s tallest dunes. As sand moves down the dune face it produces a booming noise, known as singing sand phenomenon, due to the small grain size and loose, dry packing. Endemic species include the Eureka Dune Grass, the Eureka Evening Primrose and the Shining Locoweed.

==Furnace Creek==

Furnace Creek is a spring, oasis, and village that sits on top of a remarkably symmetrical alluvial fan. The main visitor center of the park is located here as well as the Oasis at Death Valley resort complex. Controversy surrounds the use of Furnace Creek water to support the resort (complete with a swimming pool) and nearby facilities, including a golf course. The scarce springs and surrounding lush oases support thriving plant communities and attract a wide variety of animals. As the resort grew, the marshes and wetlands around it shrank.

The highest temperature in North America was recorded at Furnace Creek Ranch (134 °F or 57 °C).

The Furnace Creek Fault runs through this part of Death Valley.

== Hells Gate ==
Hells Gate is a point of interest located in Death Valley National Park, at the intersection of Daylight Pass Road and Beatty Road. There is a parking area and hiking paths.

==Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes==

The Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes are at the northern end of the valley floor and are nearly surrounded by mountains on all sides. Due to their easy access from the road and the overall proximity of Death Valley to Hollywood, these dunes have been used to film sand dune scenes for several movies including films in the Star Wars series. The largest dune is called Star Dune and is relatively stable and stationary because it is at a point where the various winds that shape the dunes converge. The depth of the sand at its crest is but this is small compared to other dunes in the area that have sand depths of up to deep.

The primary source of the dune sands is probably the Cottonwood Mountains which lie to the north and northwest. The tiny grains of quartz and feldspar that form the sinuous sculptures that make up this dune field began as much larger pieces of solid rock.

In between many of the dunes are stands of creosote bush and some mesquite on the sand and on dried mud, which used to cover this part of the valley before the dunes intruded (mesquite was the dominant plant here before the sand dunes but creosote does much better in the sand dune conditions).

==Mesquite Spring==

Mesquite Spring is located in the northernmost part of Death Valley. This part of the valley has numerous cotton top cactus, blister beetles and &quot;cholla cactus&quot;. On the alluvial fan above the springs there are 2–3 thousand year old petroglyphs from the extinct Mesquite Spring culture.

The petroglyphs here are made possible because many of the rocks in these arid conditions have desert varnish on them. This particular form of desert varnish takes 
10,000 years to make 1/100 of an inch of varnish and is deposited by a certain type of bacteria that collects the iron, manganese and clay needed to make the varnish.

Also, since varnish is created at a predictable rate, it is possible to date petroglyphs based on the amount of re-varnishing that has taken place since the marks were made. Varnish does not normally form on carbonate rocks because their surfaces weather too easily.

In a wash near some of the petroglyphs there is a fault scarp that exposes some fanglomerate which is a type of sedimentary rock which looks like concrete with large rocks intermixed. In fact it is lithified alluvial sediment.

==Mosaic Canyon==
Mosaic Canyon is a canyon in the north western mountain face of the valley which is named after a stream-derived breccia sediment with angular blocks of dolomite in a pebbly matrix. The entrance to Mosaic Canyon appears deceptively ordinary, but just a walk up the canyon narrows dramatically to a deep slot cut into the face of Tucki Mountain. Smooth, polished marble walls enclose the trail as it follows the canyon&#x27;s sinuous curves. The canyon follows faults that formed when the rocky crust of the Death Valley region began stretching just a few million years ago. Running water scoured away at the fault-weakened rock, gradually carving Mosaic canyon.

Periodic flash floods carry rocky debris (sediment) eroded from Mosaic Canyon and the surrounding hillsides toward the valley below. At the canyon mouth water spreads out and deposits its sediment load, gradually building up a large wedge-shaped alluvial fan that extends down toward Stovepipe Wells. This canyon was formed through a process of cut and fill which included periodic erosive floods followed by long periods of deposition and uplift. But due to the uplift when the next flood hit the area it would deeply cut the streambed which forms stairstep-shaped banks.

Mosaic Canyon&#x27;s polished marble walls are carved from the Noonday Dolomite and other Precambrian carbonate rocks. These rock formation began as limestone deposited during Late Precambrian (about 850–700 million years ago) when the area was covered by a warm sea. Later addition of magnesium changed the limestone, a rock made of calcium carbonate, to dolomite, a calcium-magnesium carbonate. The dolomite was later deeply buried by younger sediment. Far below the surface, high pressure and temperature altered the dolomite into the metamorphic rock, marble. The Noonday Dolomite has since been tilted from uplift.

Mosaic Canyon was named for a rock formation known as the Mosaic Breccia. Breccia is an Italian word meaning &quot;gravel&quot;. This formation is composed of angular fragments of many different kinds of parent rock, and it can be seen on the floor of the canyon just south of the parking area.

==Natural Bridge Canyon==
Natural Bridge Canyon is found on the east side of the park and is one of the few canyons with an official trailhead. Located south of the Artist&#x27;s Drive scenic loop, the canyon contains a natural stone bridge, accessible after a fifteen-minute walk from the parking area.

==Panamint Valley==
The Panamint Valley basin runs between the Panamint Range to the east and Argus and Slate ranges to the west for 65 miles (105 km). It has a width of about 10 miles (16 km). It is an endorheic basin that can form a lake after heavy rain. Airspace above the valley is part of the Panamint Military Operating Area, restricted to US military use. The ghost town of Ballarat had 400 residents at the turn of the 20th century when mines were active in the area.

==Racetrack Playa==
Racetrack Playa is a seasonally dry lake (playa) located in the northern part of the Panamint Mountains that is famous for rocks that mysteriously move across its surface. During periods of heavy rain, water washes down from nearby mountain slopes onto the playa, forming a shallow, short-lived lake. Most of the so-called &#x27;sailing stones&#x27; are from a nearby high hillside of dark dolomite on the south end of the playa. Similar rock travel patterns have been recorded in several other playas in the region but the number and length of travel grooves on The Racetrack are notable. Racetrack stones only move once every two or three years and most tracks last for just three or four years.

==Rainbow Canyon==
Rainbow Canyon is a canyon near the western edge of the park. It is commonly used by the United States Military for fighter jet training and is frequented by photographers who, from the canyon rim, are able to photograph jets flying beneath them. Since a 2019 plane crash all military air traffic has been banned from flying below the rim.

==Red Cathedral==
Red Cathedral is a geological formation located between highways 178 and 190. Formed of steep cliffs, it is composed of red colored oxidized rocks and is visible from Zabriskie point and the Golden Canyon trail.

==Saline Valley==
==Salt Creek==
Much of Salt Creek is usually dry at the surface and covered by a bright layer of salt which was created by many flooding and subsequent evaporation of water that 
periodically flows at the surface. Over time the small amount of solutes in the water accumulate to form this linear salt pan. Another part of salt creek runs with brackish water year-round. It is here that the last survivor of Lake Manly resides; the Death Valley pupfish.

==Saratoga Springs==

Saratoga Springs () is a desert oasis located in southern Death Valley National Park. The wetland lies at the southern tip of the Ibex Hills, on the floor of Death Valley and just northeast of the Amargosa River. Several springs overflow into pools totaling 6.6 acres (2.7 ha) in area, making the site the third largest marsh in the park. The pools provide habitat for several endemic species, including the Saratoga Springs pupfish. Other rare species present include the Amargosa tryonia snail, the Amargosa springsnail, the Saratoga Springs belostoma bug, the Amargosa naucorid bug, and the Death Valley June beetle. Plant life includes common reeds, bulrush and saltgrass.

The springs were probably named in 1871 by the Wheeler Survey after the resort town of Saratoga Springs, New York, and were an important water source for the twenty-mule teams of the 1880s. The area saw a failed nitrate rush in 1902, and similarly unsuccessful attempts to mine gold and silver in the middle part of the decade. The Pacific Nitrate Company arrived in 1909 and built a small camp, but left within a few years. From the 1930s through the 1960s the springs provided water for the successful talc mines in the nearby Ibex Hills.

Except for two partially collapsed stone structures, little evidence remains of human habitation at the spring. A dirt road provides access to an overlook of the area, but human entry into the wetland itself is prohibited in order to the protect the sensitive habitat.

== Scotty&#x27;s Castle ==
==Shoreline Butte==
This desert butte was once an island in a lake that filled Death Valley several times during the Pleistocene ice ages. Scientists call all manifestations of this large body of water Lake Manly. There are different horizontal linear features on the northeast flank of the butte that are ancient shorelines from this lake.

It takes some time for waves to gnaw away terraces like the ones seen on Shoreline Butte, so these benches provide records of times when the lake level stabilized long enough for waves to leave their mark on the rock. The highest strandline is one of the principal clues that geologists use to estimate the depth of the lake that once filled Death Valley. Shorelines of ancient Lake Manly are preserved in several parts of Death Valley, but nowhere is the record as clear as at Shoreline Butte. Several lakes have occupied Death Valley since the close of the Pleistocene epoch 10,000 years ago, but these younger lakes were quite shallow compared to Lake Manly (See Badwater and Devils Golf Course above).

== Teakettle Junction ==

At the junction where the unimproved road from Ubehebe Crater meets roads to the Racetrack Playa and Hunter Mountain (), there is a sign reading &quot;Teakettle Junction.&quot; While the origin of the name is unknown, it has become a tradition for visitors to attach teakettles to the sign with messages written on them. National Park Service rangers will sometimes remove a number of teakettles when there are too many.

The rock at the junction includes the bedrock sandstone of the Eureka Quartzite strata.

==Telescope Peak==

Telescope Peak is the highest point within Death Valley National Park and was named for the great distance visible from the summit – from atop this desert mountain one can see for over one hundred miles in many directions, including west to Mount Whitney, and east to Charleston Peak. Its summit rises above Badwater Basin, the lowest point in Death Valley at .

==Titus Canyon==
Titus Canyon is a narrow gorge in the Grapevine Mountains near the eastern boundary of Death Valley National Park. It features megabreccia and other rock formations, petroglyphs, and wildlife of various kinds, including bighorn sheep. Along the road to the canyon stands Leadfield, a ghost town dating to the 1920s.

== Ubehebe Crater ==
Ubehebe Crater is the largest of more than a dozen of in the Ubehebe Craters field. As groundwater exploded into steam due to the heat of magma underneath, an empty pit was left behind and the debris spread around the field. Erosion over the millennia since the eruption revealed multi-colored stripes on the crater walls dating to the Miocene. Visitors can hike on trails to the bottom or around the rim.

== Ventifact Ridge ==
Ventifact Ridge is a part of a basaltic lava flow. The rocks on its exposed and barren ridge are famous for being shaped by wind erosion and are called ventifacts. Sharp edges of ventifacts called &quot;Kanters&quot; are formed when two or more facets (planar surfaces) intersect. Open grooves in the ventifacts are called flutes. Most of the holes in the basalt are vesicles that were formed when gas escaped from the cooling lava. Some of these have been expanded or even merged by sandblasting.

Non-stop winds on this ridge are concentrated and compressed at the top of the hill and are very fast as a result. These strong winds pick-up dust and sand (mostly from the two closest alluvial fans), which literally sand-blast exposed surfaces. Winds strong enough for sandblasting come from the north and the south.

<text>The Isle of Pines (, ; name in Kanak language Kwênyii: &#x27;) is an island in the [[Pacific Ocean]], in the [[archipelago]] of [[New Caledonia]], an [[overseas collectivity]] of [[France]]. The island is part of the [[commune in France|commune]] (municipality) of [[L&#x27;Île-des-Pins]], in the [[South Province, New Caledonia|South Province]] of New Caledonia. The Isle of Pines is nicknamed&#x27; (&quot;the closest island to Paradise&quot;).

The island is around and measures by . It lies southeast of Grande Terre, New Caledonia&#x27;s main island, and is southeast of the capital Nouméa. There is one airport (code ILP) with a runway. The Isle of Pines is surrounded by the New Caledonia Barrier Reef.

The inhabitants of the island are mainly native Melanesian Kanaks, and the population is 2,000 (estimated 2006) (1989 population 1,465).

The island is rich with animal life and is home to unusual creatures such as the crested gecko &quot;Correlophus ciliatus&quot; and the world&#x27;s largest gecko, &quot;Rhacodactylus leachianus&quot;.

The &quot;&quot; is the island&#x27;s highest point, at elevation. River Ouro is the longest river.

==History==

Melanesian people lived on the island for over 2000 years before the island was first visited by Europeans. Captain James Cook in 1774 saw the island and renamed it on his second voyage to New Zealand. Cook gave the island its name after seeing the tall native pines (&quot;Araucaria columnaris&quot;). He never disembarked onto the island, but as he saw signs of inhabitance (smoke) assumed it was inhabited. In the 1840s, Protestant and Catholic missionaries arrived, along with merchants seeking sandalwood.

The French took possession of the island in 1853 at which time the native Kunies converted to the Catholic religion. In 1872, the island became a French penal colony, home to 3,000 political deportees from the Paris Commune.

== Sights ==
The ruins of a penal colony can be seen in the village of Ouro in the west of the island. The water tower of Ouro which was built by prisoners in 1874/75 and renovated in 2005 is still used.

At the cemetery &quot;Cimetière des Déportés&quot; near Ouro is a pyramid-shaped memorial and the graves of 300 deportees who died between 1872 and 1880.


== Archaeology ==
Scattered across the central plateau of the island lie more than 300 poorly understood mounds, some of which have been excavated and found to have concrete cores. No human remains or man-made objects have been found in the mounds; one snail shell embedded in excavated concrete was carbon-dated to 12,900 ± 450 years old. Much as with the American mima mounds, there is no consensus on what these mounds are, and proposed explanations have included Paleolithic, Neolithic or later human construction, natural formations, or prehistoric birds’ nests, specifically of the extinct species &quot;Sylviornis neocaledoniae.&quot;

<text>A cable machine is an item of equipment used in weight training or functional training. It consists of a rectangular, vertically oriented steel frame about 3 metres wide and 2 metres high, with a weight stack attached via a cable and pulley system to one or more handles. The cables that connect the handles to the weight stacks run through adjustable pulleys that can be fixed at any height. This allows a variety of exercises to be performed on the apparatus. One end of the cable is attached to a perforated steel bar that runs down the centre of the weight stack. To select the desired amount of resistance, move the metal pin into the labelled hole in the weight stack. The other end of the cable forms a loop, which allows the user to attach the appropriate handle for the exercise. Most cable machines have a minimum of 20 pounds (~9 kilograms) of resistance in order to counterbalance the weight of the typical attachment.

The album was primarily aimed at the European market, as shown by the exclusion of the US hits &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;I Started a Joke&quot;, &quot;Lonely Days&quot;, &quot;How Can You Mend a Broken Heart&quot; and &quot;Fanny (Be Tender with My Love)&quot;.

The album has been re-issued several times, including a 1996 version which dropped &quot;You Win Again&quot; and &quot;Ordinary Lives&quot; from the track listing. On the other hand, the version released in Hong Kong omitted two tracks and instead added &quot;Melody Fair&quot; which was not included in the original release.

<text>Pirro Ligorio ( October 30, 1583) was an Italian architect, painter, antiquarian, and garden designer during the Renaissance period. He worked as the Vatican&#x27;s Papal Architect under Popes Paul IV and Pius IV, designed the fountains at Villa d’Este at Tivoli for Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este, and served as the Ducal Antiquary in Ferrara. Ligorio emphasized and showed a deep passion for classical Roman antiquity.

==Early life and career==
Due to lack of accurate documentation, very little is known about the first three decades of Ligorio&#x27;s life. It is estimated that he was born in Naples, Italy, in 1512 or 1513 while the city was still under Spanish rule. His parents, Achille and Gismunda Ligorio, were rumored to be members of the noble class in Seggio di Portanova, a section of Naples. Around age twenty, Pirro Ligorio left the tumultuous and poverty-stricken city of Naples to pursue a more flourishing livelihood in Rome. The city was home to a thriving art community, especially under the patronage of the Vatican.

For his first job in Rome, Ligorio painted and decorated the façades of homes and palaces. This role had previously been filled by Polidoro da Caravaggio, who fled in 1527, allowing Ligorio to enter the field with very little formal artistic training. His first documented contract was signed on 12 May 1542 when Ligorio decorated the loggia on the palace of the archbishop of Benevento. He was chosen specifically for his knowledge of the grotesque style, which was popularized by Raphael and his followers in the sixteenth century. Ligorio greatly appreciated this style, and incorporated its elements (friezes, scenes from Roman history, trophies, etc.) into his work often.
Many of the paintings from his early career, unfortunately, were destroyed or repainted less than a century later. However, several surviving drawings from that time period have been recovered and attributed to Ligorio. This identification was often made based on the subject matter; many of the drawings featured façade paintings, Roman characters, and antique Renaissance objects. These loose connections allowed historians to name Ligorio as the rightful artist of these drawings, which are now held in collections across the world (including one at the Art Institute of Chicago).

In the mid sixteenth century, Ligorio was commissioned to assist in the decoration of the Oratory of San Giovanni Decollato in Rome. In particular, he painted a fresco of &quot;The Dance of Salome&quot;. Exact dates are unclear, but it is estimated he painted the fresco between 1544 and 1553. Early drawing drafts and the fresco itself shows Ligorio&#x27;s commitment to the Raphaelesque and Manneristic styles. Notably, this is one of the few surviving large works of his early career.

Around the same time, Ligorio began to explore the subject of classical antiquity. He spent a large portion of the 1540s learning as much as possible about Roman antiques, and preserved valuable information while the pope destroyed artifacts in excavation projects. In the following decade, Ligorio worked to publish this knowledge. He published one book, &quot;Delle antichità di Roma&quot;, in 1553, and engraved several antiques. He also attempted to write an encyclopedia of Roman and Greek antiquity at least twice, some parts of which can now be found in the Biblioteca Nazionale in Naples. Despite its important contributions to the Italian knowledge base of Roman antiquities, Ligorio&#x27;s writings were met with some criticism; in particular, he was charged with widespread forgery. However, no substantial evidence of forgery has been identified.

Finally, Ligorio&#x27;s period of archeological exploration and writing was accompanied by another pursuit: cartography. Between 1557 and 1563, Ligorio combined his antiquarian knowledge and drawing abilities to create several maps of Rome. Most notably, in 1561 he published his “Antiquae urbis imago” (Image of Ancient Rome), a topographical map of ancient Rome. This was considered the pinnacle of his cartographical endeavors.

== Career at the Vatican ==
=== Pope Paul IV (1555–1559) ===
When Paul IV became Pope, he was interested in hiring a fellow Neapolitan as the Vatican Architect. Three years into his papacy, in 1558, he hired Ligorio as the Architetto Fabricae Palatinae, meaning Architect of the Vatican Palace. His assistant was Sallustio Peruzzi.

His first and most prominent work was on the chapel in the newly built Papal apartment. Construction of the residential areas had been prioritized, allowing Paul to move in by October 1556. The chapel, however, remained unfinished and was tasked to Ligorio. He designed two large angel paintings for the space, and finished the project in about ten months. Around the same time, he received the commission to create a casino for the pope near Belvedere Court. This project was stalled due to financial concerns, but would later become one of Ligorio&#x27;s cornerstone projects under the patronage of Pope Pius IV.

Paul IV also pursued major renovations to the papal palace in this time period. In particular, Paul aimed to increase the flow of light in the Hall of Constantine. Ligorio, as his most trusted architect, was chosen to remedy the darkness problem. They chose to destroy the old papal apartment and incorporate a rooftop garden into the space, allowing more light to enter the Hall of Constantine.

Towards the end of Paul IV&#x27;s tenure, he asked Ligorio to design a monstrance, or tabernacle, to be used for special papal trips. It was to be stored in the newly designed chapel. Unfortunately, Paul died while the project was still in its early stages. The following pope, however, greatly valued continuation of unfinished projects, and ordered that Ligorio finish the monstrance. Upon completion, it was sent to Milan as a gift to the Duomo.

=== Pope Pius IV (1559–1565) ===
Pius IV rose to the papacy in 1559, already holding a reputation as a strong patron of the arts—architecture especially. In fact, within the first three years of his pontificate, he spent a million and a half gold scudi on building projects. His approach was unique in that he prioritized finishing incomplete projects, rather than starting new ones. This aligned well with Ligorio&#x27;s values, specifically his desire to restore fragmented artifacts and preserve classical antiquities.

Under Pius IV, Ligorio was once again paired with his assistant, Sallustio Peruzzi. Their first major project was remodeling the Vatican Library in 1560. Some records suggest plans to create an entirely new library, but due to lack of funding, these updates likely involved smaller-scale woodworking and masonry by Ligorio. He was also tasked with smaller projects in this time, such as masonry work and apartment building throughout the palace.

In May 1560, Ligorio received a commission of great significance: the continuation of Paul&#x27;s plans for the papal casino. Located in the woods behind the Belvedere court, Pius&#x27; revamped plans for the space included a second story, large fountain, and oval courtyard with arched entryways. The decorations matched Ligorio&#x27;s preferred Raphaelesqu style. It was named the Casino of Pius IV in honor of the pope who supported its construction. Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt called it &quot;the most beautiful afternoon retreat that modern architecture has created.&quot;

On 2 December 1560, Ligorio was awarded with honorary Roman citizenship for his contributions to the culture and architecture of the city. This was a major honor, awarded to only three other people during the sixteenth century: Michaelangelo, Titian, and Fra Guglielmo della Porta. For the remainder of his life, Ligorio identified as both a Neapolitan citizen by birth and a Roman citizen. This recognition also increased the commissions and projects for which Ligorio was pursued, and made the papacy of Pius IV one of Ligorio&#x27;s busiest times. 

This period also marked one of Ligorio&#x27;s most prominent ventures into engineering. Papal duties included protecting the cities in its territory, which involved repairing fortifications in those cities. The duties of a Renaissance architect included consideration of engineering concerns, so Ligorio engaged in these renovations during his time as the Architect of the Vatican. He is particularly remembered for his role in the restoration of the Acqua Vergine, an ancient Roman aqueduct. Its malfunction was forcing Roman citizens to use the unsanitary water of the Tiber River. Ligorio demanded its reconstruction, which began in April 1561 and took approximately five years to complete.

In the early 1560s, the pope turned his attention toward the completion of several projects in the Belvedere Court. Ligorio in particular focused on the Nicchione built by Bramante in the northern end of the Belvedere Court. He added a semicircular loggia, which ended up being used in many of Rome&#x27;s festivals as a fireworks site. Ligorio&#x27;s other contribution to the Belvedere Court was an open-air theater on the southern end, which was completed in May 1565. Unfortunately this theater was torn down in the eighteenth century and replaced by a wall. The Belvedere Court itself was used for a large tournament in March 1565 in honor of the marriage of the pope&#x27;s nephew. The Nicchione space was designed to be viewed specifically from a window in the pope&#x27;s apartment, framed like a painting.

Another project requested by Pius IV in 1565 was the organization of Vatican archives. Ligorio was tasked with designing a structure to hold these records. Although little remains of this Archivio today, its architectural design suggests a brief departure from Ligorio&#x27;s typical style (as exemplified by, for example, the extravagant Casino). Normally his facades were beautifully and intricately decorated in the mannerist tradition. This building, however, was notably utilitarian and modest. Ligorio was staying true to the purpose of the building and Pius&#x27; wishes by matching its design to its no-frills function.

After the death of Michelangelo, Ligorio was appointed as the architect of the San Pietro church in May 1564. This greatly annoyed Giorgio Vasari, an admirer of Michelangelo and enemy of Ligorio. The second architect on the project was Giacomo Vignola. Together they accomplished little progress on the church, and were eventually released from their duties under the new pope.

=== Imprisonment ===
Ligorio&#x27;s employment at the Vatican was briefly interrupted in the summer of 1565 when he was imprisoned for one week. Allegedly, he had committed fraud by stealing building materials during several of his papal architectural projects. He was investigated extensively and had his writings removed. He was released with little incident, aside from having medallions worth six thousand &quot;scudi&quot; removed from his possession. Accusations like these, however, did not help Ligorio&#x27;s already controversial fame and earlier allegations of forgery against him.

=== Pope Pius V (1566–1572) ===
Unlike his predecessor, Pius V had little to do with Ligorio; this was mostly due to the two popes&#x27; deep-rooted ideological differences. He tasked Ligorio with some minor woodworking and design projects; Ligorio held on to his title of Palace Architect until possibly as late as June 1567. During the final years of his tenure, he actually returned to Ferrara for work.

== Ferrara ==
=== Ippolito II d&#x27;Este ===
In September 1550, before his employment at the Vatican and during his study of classical antiquity, Ligorio was hired by the Cardinal of Ferrara (Ippolito II d&#x27;Este) to accompany him to Tivoli. There, while the Cardinal served as governor, Ligorio managed his antique collection and served as a top advisor. The area was rich with remains of old villas and temples, allowing Ligorio to further his research of Roman antiques and the governor to add to his own personal collection.

=== Villa d&#x27;Este ===
Upon arriving to Tivoli, Ippolito II d&#x27;Este decided to turn an old monastery into his own luxury villa. Building would be stalled for the majority of the decade due to changes in Ippolito&#x27;s duties, but fully resumed in 1560. Giovanni Alberto Galvani served as the main architect, but Pirro Ligorio took charge of the villa&#x27;s extensive and intricate gardens. These gardens included many waterworks and fountains (utilizing Ligorio&#x27;s knowledge of aqueduct engineering), as well as a collection of ancient sculpture. Ligorio designed both a larger public garden and a smaller private garden. The latter can be accessed directly from the palace, and utilizes shaded walls to maintain a private retreat. 

As described by David Coffin, Ligorio&#x27;s most prominent biographer, Ligorio employed three major themes in these gardens. First and foremost was a focus on the relationship between nature and art—a concern indicative of the Renaissance period. Many of Ligorio&#x27;s waterworks and sculptures incorporated flora and fauna, marrying the natural aspects of the garden with the man-made artistic elements. The second theme was geographic; Ligorio designed the fountains to represent the three rivers flowing into the Fountain of Rome in an ode to the cardinal&#x27;s appreciation of the arts. Finally, Ligorio&#x27;s use of mythological iconography, specifically the influence of the Garden of the Hesperides, was executed with special attentiveness. This incorporation of the imagery of Hercules and his struggle with virtue and vice showcases both Ligorio&#x27;s knowledge of ancient Greek and Roman mythology, but also the cardinal&#x27;s Christian faith and moral grounding.

=== Alfonso II d&#x27;Este ===

Much later, at the end of Ligorio&#x27;s work for the Vatican, he returned to Ferrara yet again—this time in a more purely intellectual role. Beginning in December 1568, he served under Duke Alfonso II d&#x27;Este of Ferrara as the Ducal Antiquarian. He also acquired the title of Lector at the University of Ferrara. Ligorio&#x27;s main duties involved preparing the ducal library and organizing an antique museum for Alfonso&#x27;s court. He contributed numerous drawings and designs to these records, and continued to foster a reputation of antiquarian knowledge in Ferrara. In 1580, he was named an honorary citizen—adding a third layer to his identity as a Neopolitan and Roman.
On 16 November 1570, a major earthquake hit the city of Ferrara and inflicted heavy damage on its architecture. This sparked an interest in Ligorio, who decided to write a treatise on historical earthquakes. He detailed the effects of the Ferrara earthquake for several months, then began developing plans for an earthquake-resistant home. Ligorio diverted from the traditional view of earthquakes as supernatural phenomenon, and treated them as a natural occurrence around which man could reason. Many of the elements he incorporated, including thicker brick walls and stone piers, match modern anti-seismic practices. Again, this shows Ligorio&#x27;s concern for not just the design, but also the engineering and structural integrity of his buildings.

== Legacy ==
Ligorio reportedly died in October 1583 after suffering a particularly rough fall in Ferrara.

Despite his major contributions to Renaissance Italian architecture, classical antiquity, and garden design, Pirro Ligorio maintains surprisingly little presence in accounts of that time period. Giovanni Baglioni published the first biography of Ligorio in 1642, which was later replicated in other biographies by Milizia and Nagler, except with numerous factual errors. This may be due, in part, to the lack of documentation regarding Pirro Ligorio&#x27;s life. The first thirty years of his life, for example, remain almost entirely a mystery. Additionally, many of Ligorio&#x27;s designs, drawings, and buildings were destroyed over the years, making documentation of his work even more difficult. In the twentieth century, historian David Coffin wrote his dissertation on the life of Ligorio and quickly became the world&#x27;s foremost expert on the architect. Coffin&#x27;s book, &quot;Pirro Ligorio: The Renaissance Artist, Architect, and Antiquarian&quot;, remains the most valuable and complete account of Ligorio&#x27;s life and works.

In the Epilogue of his book, Coffin describes Ligorio&#x27;s personality as having three main traits: curiosity, imagination, and ambition. His curiosity led him to pursue a multitude of projects and interests, including painting, garden design, engineering, gardening, cartography, and archaeology. His imagination can be seen in the groundbreaking marriage of botany, sculpture, waterworks, and mythology found in the gardens at Tivoli. Finally, his ambition: Ligorio pursued his chosen fields with great focus and fervor, gaining admirers as well as detractors along the way. In particular, Ligorio found an enemy in fellow Renaissance architect Giorgio Vasari, who refused to include a biography of Ligorio in his &quot;Vite&quot;. This had a significant impact on the immortalization of Ligorio&#x27;s legacy, and left his life much less documented compared to his contemporaries.

<doc id="1228933" wikidata="Q794069" url="?curid=1228933" title="Best of Bee Gees">
<text>Best of Bee Gees is a 1969 compilation album by the English-Australian rock band Bee Gees. It was their first international greatest hits album. It featured their singles from 1966–1969 with the exception of the band&#x27;s 1968 single &quot;Jumbo&quot;.

==History==
The following songs in this compilation from 1966-1969 were very popular worldwide and were picked up by many casual fans who owned no other Bee Gees album. The compilation includes the US singles &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;I Started a Joke.&quot; However, the 1968 song &quot;Jumbo&quot; that was also released as a single was not included. This was the first LP appearance of &quot;Words&quot; and first LP appearance outside North America of &quot;I&#x27;ve Gotta Get a Message to You.&quot; Both songs were presented in stereo on the Atco version and in mono elsewhere. Many fans consider the songs from &quot;Bee Gees&#x27; 1st&quot; to sound better here than on the original album.

==Release==
With the release of this compilation, Robin Gibb had left the group after the previous release, &quot;Odessa&quot;, and this compilation was released while the remaining Bee Gees worked on their next album, &quot;Cucumber Castle&quot;. Guitarist Vince Melouney, although playing guitar on most of the tracks, is not pictured on the front or back cover as he had departed the group a year earlier. The cover of the album features only the four members and was taken in early 1967 before Melouney joined the band. The back cover is from the winter of 1968-1969. The original 1969 vinyl release included the Bee Gees&#x27; 1966 Australian top ten hit &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, but due to licensing issues with Festival Records in Australia, the group&#x27;s 1969 hit &quot;Tomorrow Tomorrow&quot; was substituted on the Polydor CD release. The album is noted by fans for its bad stereo mix of the song &quot;Words&quot;, which increased the vocals so much that the percussion was lost in the background. This is the only album/CD with this mix. All future compilations have a more balanced stereo mix.

The first issue in Germany was in August 1969, and had the song &quot;Please Read Me&quot; on the disc by mistake where &quot;I Can&#x27;t See Nobody&quot; belongs. This was fixed a month later.

With the release of &quot;Their Greatest Hits: The Record&quot; in 2001, this CD went out of print for several years until Rhino reissued it in November 2008 with the same tracks as the Polydor CD. Three of the thirteen tracks from the combined vinyl/CD &quot;Best of Bee Gees&quot; do not appear amongst the forty seven tracks on &quot;Their Greatest Hits: The Record&quot;: &quot;I Can&#x27;t See Nobody&quot; and &quot;Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You&quot; had only actually been the B-sides of other hits on &quot;Best of Bee Gees&quot;, while &quot;Tomorrow, Tomorrow&quot; had charted but had never reached the top 20 in the charts of the UK, USA nor Australia.

==Legacy==
In October 2010, it was listed at No. 16 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

Noel Gallagher commented that &quot;Best of Bee Gees&quot; is one of his favourite albums and that it inspired the cover art of his band High Flying Birds&#x27; greatest hits album, &quot;Back the Way We Came: Vol. 1 (2011–2021)&quot;.

<text>Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events (also simply known as A Series of Unfortunate Events) is a 2004 American black comedy adventure film directed by Brad Silberling from a screenplay by Robert Gordon, based on the first three novels of the book series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;: &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; (1999), &quot;The Reptile Room&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Wide Window&quot; (2000), by Lemony Snicket (the pen name of American author Daniel Handler). It stars Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Timothy Spall, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Billy Connolly, Cedric the Entertainer, Luis Guzmán, Jennifer Coolidge, and Meryl Streep, and Jude Law as the voice of Lemony Snicket.

Nickelodeon Movies purchased the film rights to Handler&#x27;s book series in 2000 and soon began development of a film with Barry Sonnenfeld attached to direct. Handler adapted the screenplay and courted Carrey for Count Olaf. Sonnenfeld left over budget concerns in January 2003 and Brad Silberling took over. Robert Gordon rewrote Handler&#x27;s script, and principal photography started in November 2003. The film was entirely shot using sound stages and backlots at Paramount Pictures and Downey Studios.

&quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on December 17, 2004, by Paramount Pictures with DreamWorks Pictures distributing the movie internationally. It received positive reviews from critics, with many praising its production values, Newman&#x27;s score and performances (particularly Carrey&#x27;s performance), while some criticized its comical tone and short length. The film grossed $211 million worldwide. At the 77th Academy Awards, it won the Academy Award for Best Makeup (the second to involve Carrey, after &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; in 2000) and received nominations for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score.

==Plot==
In a clock tower, investigator Lemony Snicket begins writing a documentation of the whereabouts of the Baudelaire children: 14-year-old inventor Violet, her 12-year-old bibliophile brother Klaus, and their 2-year-old sister Sunny. One day, the children are orphaned when a mysterious fire destroys their mansion, killing their parents. Mr. Poe, the family banker, manages their affairs and leaves them in the care of Count Olaf, a nefarious stage actor intent upon secretly obtaining their family fortune, which will remain in the custody of the bank until Violet turns 18. Olaf forces them to do heavy chores and belittles them.

Driving back from the court where Olaf has legally obtained custody of the kids, he stops to go into a general store, leaving them locked in the car parked on train tracks with a train heading toward them, Mr. Poe calls and Violet tries to tell him that they were going to be hit by the train, but is unable to hear her due to him driving next to the train. The children divert the train by building a device to remotely activate the railroad switch. Mr. Poe arrives and takes them away, thinking that Olaf was allowing the kids to drive the car alone.

The orphans are taken to uncle Dr. Montgomery &quot;Monty&quot; Montgomery, an eccentric herpetologist who treats them incredibly kindly. One day, Olaf arrives disguised as a new assistant &quot;Stephano&quot;. The orphans attempt to warn Uncle Monty about Count Olaf&#x27;s arrival, but he believes Stephano is after the Incredibly Deadly Viper, a giant misnomer python, in his laboratory that he discovered. Uncle Monty is discovered dead shortly after, and his death is blamed on the viper, although the children are certain that Count Olaf murdered him. They are almost placed in Stephano&#x27;s care by Mr. Poe, but Sunny proves his guilt by showing that the snake is harmless, and Stephano escapes.

Mr. Poe takes the children to their Aunt Josephine, a grammar-obsessed widow with panphobia, living on a house at the edge of a cliff. Olaf later appears, disguised as a sea captain named &quot;Captain Sham&quot;, to meddle with their plans again. One day, Josephine is not at the house, leaving an apparent suicide note entrusting them to Captain Sham. Klaus deduces that Olaf forced her to forge the note, but she left a hidden message revealing her location. A hurricane causes the house to fall into the lake; however, the children escape. They sail to the cave where Aunt Josephine is hiding and rescue her, but attract leeches due to Josephine eating a banana. Olaf appears and takes the children, leaving Josephine to be eaten by the leeches. Mr. Poe then finds him with the children, and Olaf pretends to have rescued them. Mr. Poe is fooled and returns the children back to Olaf, believing that he has redeemed himself.

Olaf plans a play titled &quot;The Marvelous Marriage&quot;, starring Violet and him as a bride and groom, respectively. Klaus&#x27;s suspicions reveal that Olaf is planning to take advantage of the play to really marry Violet in an attempt to get the fortune, using legally recognized vows and a bona fide justice of the peace. Olaf locks Sunny up in a birdcage, threatening to drop her to her death if Violet refuses to take part in the play. Klaus escapes and finds a hidden tower in Olaf&#x27;s house, where he discovers a large window with a set of lenses that, if positioned correctly, can focus the rays of the sun. Klaus realizes that Olaf used it to set fire to the Baudelaire mansion. Using the window, Klaus manages to burn the marriage certificate, leading to Olaf&#x27;s arrest. As a punishment, Olaf is made to suffer every hardship that he forced upon the Baudelaire kids before serving a life sentence. However, a jury of his peers overturns his sentencing and Olaf vanishes.

Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are taken to visit the charred remains of their old home one final time. A lost letter from their parents finally arrives, and inside is a spyglass announcing their family&#x27;s secret society before they became orphans. Snicket finishes writing his documentation and hides the papers in the clock tower for his publisher to find. As Mr. Poe drives the Baudelaires to their next home, Snicket concludes that despite the siblings&#x27; recent unfortunate events, they have each other.

=== Notes ===
Handler initially viewed Count Olaf as a James Mason type. Carrey was not familiar with the book series when he was cast, but he became a fan of the series. &quot;Handler&#x27;s books are just a bold and original way to tell a children&#x27;s story,&quot; he said. Carrey was also attracted to the role despite self-parody concerns. Silberling was open to Carrey&#x27;s idea of improvisation for various scenes, especially the Stephano and Captain Sham alter egos. To make his prosthetic makeup more comfortable and easier to apply, Carrey shaved his head bald for the part. His inspiration for Olaf&#x27;s voice was combining the voices of Orson Welles and Bela Lugosi.

Emily Browning was cast as Violet Baudelaire when she auditioned at a casting call in Australia. She was sent Handler&#x27;s original script when Barry Sonnenfeld was planning to direct, and screen tested for the part using an English accent. Browning became a fan of the books after reading Handler&#x27;s original script. The actress was not cast until Silberling took over, then her character&#x27;s accent was changed to American.

==Production==
===Development===
Nickelodeon Movies purchased the film rights to the &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; novel series in May 2000. Paramount Pictures, owner of Nickelodeon Movies, agreed to co-finance, along with Scott Rudin. Various directors, including Terry Gilliam and Roman Polanski, were interested in making the film. One of Daniel Handler&#x27;s favorite candidates was Guy Maddin. In June 2002, it was announced that Barry Sonnenfeld was hired to direct. He was chosen because he previously collaborated with Rudin and because of his black comedy directing style from &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; and &quot;Get Shorty&quot;. Sonnenfeld referred to the &quot;Lemony Snicket&quot; novels as his favorite children&#x27;s stories. The director hired Handler to write the script with the intention of making &quot;Lemony Snicket&quot; a musical, and cast Jim Carrey as Count Olaf in September 2002.

The film suffered setbacks in development in December 2002. Rudin left &quot;Unfortunate Events&quot; over budget concerns. While Sonnenfeld and Carrey remained, Sonnenfeld admitted he was skeptical of Paramount&#x27;s $100 million budget. The studio decided that changing the shoot from Hollywood to Wilmington, North Carolina, would be less expensive. The April 2003 start date was also pushed back. Paramount eventually settled the situation in January 2003 by enlisting help from DreamWorks Pictures to co-finance the film, but Sonnenfeld vacated the director&#x27;s position. Rudin and Sonnenfeld had no involvement with the film afterward, but were credited as executive producers. Carrey remained with approval over the hiring of the next director.

Brad Silberling signed on to direct in February 2003. He was not familiar with the series when he was first approached. He quickly read the first three novels and was excited that &quot;Hollywood was taking a chance to put over $100 million to adapt these inventive children&#x27;s books onto screen&quot;. Handler, who wrote eight drafts of the script for Sonnenfeld, was replaced by Robert Gordon in May 2003. Handler approved of the changes that were made to his screenplay. &quot;I was offered credit on the film for screenwriting by the Writers Guild of America&quot;, Handler continued, &quot;but I didn&#x27;t take it because I didn&#x27;t write it. I felt like it would be an insult to the guy who did.&quot;

===Filming===
Filming was set to begin in October 2003, but was pushed back. Principal photography commenced on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted the younger actors to feel as if they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf&#x27;s mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and the ruins of the Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one million gallons of water. The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; wrapped on May 29, 2004.

===Design===
Silberling, production designer Rick Heinrichs and costume designer Colleen Atwood all aimed for the film&#x27;s setting to be ambiguous, giving it a &quot;timeless&quot; feel. Heinrichs also added steampunk designs to the period. To contribute to the setting, Silberling hired Emmanuel Lubezki as the cinematographer because he was impressed with the trio&#x27;s work on &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;.

Lubezki compared the cinematic similarities to &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, notably the monochromatic look of both films. He also chose a specific color palette backdrop for &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. &quot;The story is very episodic, so we picked a different color scheme for each section. For example, Count Olaf&#x27;s house has a lot of greens, blacks and grays; the house of Uncle Monty has a lot of greens and browns and a bit of yellow; and the house of Aunt Josephine has blues and blacks.&quot; The railroad crossing set was constructed on a cyclorama, which was the most ambitious set piece for the art department on using elements of &quot;in house&quot; special effects and matte paintings.

===Visual effects===
Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), supervised by Stefen Fangmeier, created the film&#x27;s 505 visual effects shots. The filmmakers used as few digital effects as possible, though the train and smoke for the railroad crossing scene were created entirely by computer animation. ILM also used color grading techniques for the Lake Lachrymose scene, which required complete animation for the leeches. The digital animators studied footage of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season to accurately depict Hurricane Herman, which was ILM&#x27;s most ambitious use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) for the film. Nexus Productions designed the opening &quot;Littlest Elf&quot; animated sequence by modeling it after stop-motion animation and completing it with computer animation. The snakes at Monty&#x27;s house were a combination of real snakes and animatronics. The animatronics, primarily the Incredibly Deadly Viper, were used as reference models that ILM later enhanced using CGI. Because working with infants was sometimes risky in producing a film, four scenes involving Sunny Baudelaire required CGI with motion capture technology. Among these are the shot of Sunny hanging on to a table by her teeth, catching a spindle with her mouth and the scene where she is entangled with the Incredibly Deadly Viper. Animation supervisor Colin Brady used his baby daughter for motion capture recording. Kevin Yagher designed a remote-controlled animatronic of Sunny.

==Release==

===Marketing===

In October 2002, Nickelodeon Movies hired Activision (which actually had a partnership with DreamWorks) to create the film&#x27;s tie-in video game. The agreement also included options for sequels. Silberling delivered his first cut of the film to the studio in August 2004. Fearing his original version was &quot;too dark&quot;, Paramount and DreamWorks conducted test screenings. The film was then reedited over family-friendliness concerns. Given its December release, the film&#x27;s marketing campaign was criticized as a deliberately anti-holiday comedy with taglines like &quot;Taking the cheer out of Christmas&quot; and &quot;Mishaps. Misadventures. Mayhem. Oh Joy.&quot; The premiere of&quot; Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; was held at the Cinerama Dome on December 13, 2004. A tent display on Vine Street was decorated with pieces from the film&#x27;s sets.

===Home media===
&quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on April 26, 2005. A Portuguese-labeled All-Region Blu-ray was released in 2012 and then an American Region A Blu-ray was released on September 9, 2014. The film was re-released on DVD on January 24, 2017.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; grossed $118.6 million in the United States and Canada and $92.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $211.5 million, against a budget of $140 million.

The film was released in the United States and Canada on December 17, 2004, on 4,400 screens at 3,620 theaters, earning $30.1 million in its opening weekend and finishing first at the box office. In its second weekend the film fell to second behind &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot;, grossing $12.6 million. It was the highest-grossing film under the Nickelodeon Movies banner until &quot;The Last Airbender&quot; surpassed it.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 72% based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Although it softens the nasty edges of its source material, &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; is a gothic visual treat, and it features a hilariously manic turn from Jim Carrey as the evil Count Olaf.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 62 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Robert K. Elder of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised Rick Heinrichs&#x27;s production design and Carrey&#x27;s balanced performance as a scene stealer, calling the film &quot;exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive.&quot; Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reasoned over a fellow film-goer&#x27;s characterization of Count Olaf, &quot;Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He&#x27;s not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can&#x27;t let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he&#x27;s rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur.&quot; Ty Burr, in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, observed, &quot;Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling&#x27;s not a hack like Chris Columbus, and &quot;Snicket&quot; has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. The film&#x27;s no masterpiece, but at least you&#x27;re in the hands of people who know what they&#x27;re doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children&#x27;s innate sense that the world is &quot;not&quot; a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet.&quot;

Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that &quot;the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; manages to remain witty throughout.&quot; Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: &quot;Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I&#x27;ll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, the best superhero movie ever made.&quot; Scott Foundas of &quot;Variety&quot; gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the story line in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, &quot;&quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; suggests what &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton&#x27;s longtime production designer Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton&#x27;s &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==Cancelled franchise and reboot==
===Cancelled film series===
Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies hoped that the film would become a series like the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. Carrey thought his character would be good as the basis for a film franchise since each installment would feature new disguises for Count Olaf allowing him to dive into a new role each time, though he said he didn&#x27;t &quot;have a deal&quot; for a sequel. In May 2005, producer Laurie MacDonald said &quot;&quot;Lemony Snicket&quot; is still something Paramount is interested in pursuing and we&#x27;re going to be talking with them more.&quot;

In October 2008, Handler said that &quot;a sequel does seem to be in the works. Paramount has had quite a few corporate shakeups, which has led to many a delay. Of course, many, many plans in Hollywood come to naught, but I&#x27;m assured that another film will be made. Someday. Perhaps.&quot; In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film, with each film in a new medium, due to the young lead actors having grown too old to continue their roles, saying, &quot;In an odd way, the best thing you could do is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, &#x27;Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors. Now, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to have to show you the real thing.&#x27;&quot;

===Television series===

In November 2014, Netflix announced its plans for a television adaptation of the entire novel series. The series stars Neil Patrick Harris, Malina Weissman, Louis Hynes and Presley Smith, with Patrick Warburton as Lemony Snicket. The series, also titled &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, premiered on January 13, 2017. The first season consisted of eight episodes, and adapts the first four books of the series. &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; season two was released on March 30, 2018, and contains 10 episodes, adapting books five through nine of the novel series. The third and final season was released on January 1, 2019, and adapts the four remaining books in seven episodes.

==Video game==
A video game based on the film was released in 2004 by Activision for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and Microsoft Windows. The player plays as all three orphans at points in the game.

<text>Manhattan Murder Mystery is a 1993 American black comedy mystery film directed by Woody Allen, which he wrote with Marshall Brickman, and starring Allen, Alan Alda, Anjelica Huston, and Diane Keaton. The film centers on a married couple&#x27;s investigation of the death of their neighbor&#x27;s wife.

The film began as an early draft of &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, which Allen co-wrote with Brickman. Eventually, the script evolved and principal photography took place in 1992, in the titular city. It was released in August 1993 to positive reviews. Keaton was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. This film marked the eighth, and most recent, collaboration between Allen and Keaton.

==Plot==
Larry Lipton, an editor at HarperCollins, and his wife Carol have a pleasant encounter in the elevator with older neighbors, Paul and Lillian House. They are invited to an evening with the Houses where the women exchange information on exercise routines. The next day, Lillian dies of a heart attack, shocking the Liptons as she appeared robust and healthy. They become suspicious of Paul&#x27;s cheerfulness after his wife&#x27;s death. When Carol brings the widower a dessert, she finds a crematory urn under his kitchen sink that contradicts his story about Lillian&#x27;s burial. Carol decides to investigate and steals the key to the House apartment from the super, entering when Paul is away and snooping to find two tickets to Paris and hotel reservations with a woman named “Helen Moss.” Carol dials the code for the last number dialed, and the phone is answered by someone saying “Waldron”. Paul returns while Helen is snooping, narrowly missing her hiding under the bed, but she manages to sneak out undetected. Paul later finds her reading glasses under the bed, but Carol pretends she lost them on the first visit, supposing the glasses were kicked under the bed. Appalled at his wife’s breaking and entering, Larry wants her to stop. Obsessed, Carol engages the cooperation of their more adventurous close friend, Ted, who becomes as obsessed as Carol with the mystery.

Carol and Ted track down Helen Moss, an actress, whom they surveil. A few days later, Carol spots a woman who looks identical to Lillian on a passing bus. Larry suggests she has a twin, but Ted finds out Lillian has none. Ted and Carol follow the bus route to the end, discovering a shabby Hotel Waldron. Returning later, Carol and Larry find Lillian dead in the bedroom. The responding police find no trace of the body. Carol surmises that Paul was hiding in the closet when they found the body and then moved the body. Later, Carol and Larry find Lillian&#x27;s body in the emergency exit panel of the elevator. They see Paul putting the body in a car and witness him disposing of the body by dropping it into an industrial melting furnace.

Marcia Fox, an author that Larry publishes, is drawn into the amateur investigation when Larry sets her up on a date with Ted. Marcia theorizes that the dead body was Lillian&#x27;s wealthy sister, who resembled her and had a heart attack while visiting the Houses. The Houses took advantage of the situation by claiming &quot;Lillian&quot; had died so Lillian could impersonate her sister, hiding at the Waldron Hotel, while cleaning out her sister’s bank accounts and liquidating her assets. After getting the funds, Paul double-crossed Lillian and killed her so he could run away with the younger Helen. Marcia devises a plan to trick Paul into incriminating himself by using Helen, someone he trusts, to claim she saw Lillian’s unincinerated body.

Ted, a playwright theater owner, sets up a false audition for actress Helen Moss, having her read aloud a phony script with innocuous text written by Ted that will not tip off Helen while they secretly record her. Splicing together words from the recorded script, they create a phone call from Helen to Paul warning that she has been shown Lillian’s unincinerated body by blackmailers who want $200,000 to give up the body. Using five recorders with different combinations of phrases, they respond reasonably well to Paul’s anticipated questions to “Helen”, cutting the conversation short by saying, “I have to hang up.”

The plan backfires when Paul kidnaps Carol and demands Lillian&#x27;s body in exchange for her. At the run-down second-run movie theater Paul owns, where Carol is being held, Larry dodges Paul’s bullets in a film noir chase parody echoing the in-process showing of Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; during a similar shootout-in-a-room-full-of-mirrors sequence in the film. Mrs. Dalton, Paul&#x27;s erstwhile loyal assistant and jealous spurned aging former lover, shoots Paul with a bitter reference to being used and discarded. Larry rescues Carol, and they call the police. Marcia&#x27;s theory is proven correct; and Larry and Carol and Ted and Marcia pair off and enjoy separate celebratory dinners.

Allen started &quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot; as an early draft of &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, but he did not feel that it was substantial enough, and he decided to go in a different direction. He put off making the film for years because he felt it was too lightweight, &quot;like an airplane book read&quot;. Allen decided to revisit the material in the early 1990s. He contacted Marshall Brickman, who co-wrote &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, and they developed the story further. The role of Carol was originally written for Mia Farrow, but the part was recast when she and Allen ended their relationship and became embroiled in a custody battle over their three children. Allegations in the media claimed that changes were made to the film in what was &quot;definitely a reaction&quot; to Allen&#x27;s relationship problems, including the casting of Anjelica Huston as &quot;a much younger first time novelist&quot; with whom Allen&#x27;s character became romantically involved (Huston was 41 during production).

In the fall of 1992, Allen called Diane Keaton and asked her to fill in for Farrow, and she immediately accepted. When asked if he had re-written the script to fit Keaton&#x27;s talents, Allen said: 

Making the film was a form of escape for Allen because the &quot;past year was so exhausting that I wanted to just indulge myself in something I could relax and enjoy&quot;. He also found it very therapeutic working with Keaton again. After getting over her initial panic in her first scene with Alan Alda, Keaton and Allen slipped back into their old rhythm. After she had trouble with that scene, Allen decided to re-shoot it. In the meantime, she worked with her acting coach and did other scenes that went well. According to Allen, Keaton changed the dynamic of the film because he &quot;always look(s) sober and normal compared to Keaton. I turn into the straight man&quot;. Huston said that the set was &quot;oddly free of anxiety, introspection and pain&quot;, and this was due to Keaton&#x27;s presence.

The film was shot in the fall of 1992 on the streets of Greenwich Village, the Upper East Side and the Upper West Side. Allen had cinematographer Carlo Di Palma rely on hand-held cameras, &quot;swiveling restlessly from one room to another, or zooming in abruptly for a close look.&quot;

Larry and Carol Lipton&#x27;s apartment is at 200 East 78th Street, between 2nd and 3rd Avenue and between two groups of New York City Designated Landmarks, east of one group of rowhouses and west of another group. Allen staged a climactic shoot-out in a roomful of mirrors that, according to Allen, referenced a similar shoot-out in Orson Welles&#x27; film &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot;.

The film marked Allen&#x27;s second and final film with TriStar Pictures, and it was speculated in the press that this deal was not extended because of the filmmaker&#x27;s personal problems or that his films were not very profitable. Allen, however, denied these allegations in interviews at the time. Zach Braff, who was 17 years old at the time, appeared in one scene as Nick Lipton, the son of Larry and Carol. Years later, he said: &quot;When I look at that scene now, all I can see is the terror in my eyes.”

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Manhattan Murder Mystery&quot; opened on August 18, 1993, in 268 theaters and made USD $2 million in its opening weekend. It went on to gross $11.3 million in North America, below its estimated $13.5 million budget. Its £1,920,825 in box office made it the number-one film in the United Kingdom for the weekend ending January 23, 1994.

===Critical response===
The film was well received by critics and holds a 94% positive &quot;Fresh&quot; rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with 29 positive out of 31 reviews.

In his review for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, David Ansen wrote, &quot;On screen, Keaton and Allen have always been made for each other: they still strike wonderfully ditsy sparks&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, and advised fans to forget Allen&#x27;s tabloid woes because &quot;there&#x27;s a better reason why Allen fans should give it a shot. It&#x27;s very, very funny, and there&#x27;s no mystery about that&quot;. Janet Maslin called it a &quot;dated detective story&quot; but also wrote, &quot;it achieves a gentle, nostalgic grace and a hint of un-self-conscious wisdom&quot;. Desson Howe, in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, complained that there was &quot;little &#x27;new&#x27;&quot; in this film. Allen and Keaton are essentially playing Alvy Singer and Annie Hall gone middle-aged&quot;.

===Nominations===
* 1994 César Awards: Best Foreign Film
* 48th British Academy Film Awards: Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Anjelica Huston
* 51st Golden Globe Awards: Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role – Comedy/Musical, Diane Keaton

<text>Kamila Stösslová (née Neumannová; 1891–1935) was a Czech woman. The composer Leoš Janáček, upon meeting her in 1917 in the Moravian resort town of Luhačovice, fell deeply in love with her, despite the fact that both of them were married, and that he was almost forty years older than she was. She had a profound influence on the composer in his last decade.

Kamila was at the time living in Luhačovice with her husband, David Stössel, and their two sons, Rudolf (born 1913) and Otto (born 1916). David was in the army and assisted Janáček in obtaining vital food supplies in wartime. David Stössel&#x27;s army service may have meant he could be at Luhačovice only on some days, thus giving Janáček opportunities to converse with Kamila. Janáček arrived in the resort on 3 July 1917 (he preferred Luhačovice over other spas due to its proximity to his house in Brno). By 8 July he had jotted down a fragment of her speech in his diary. His correspondence with Kamila had begun with a brief note by 24 July 1917.

Despite her ambivalence about his feelings for her, Janáček was inspired by her to create the lead characters of two of his operas: Káťa in &quot;Katya Kabanová&quot; and Emilia Marty in &quot;The Makropulos Affair&quot;. He acknowledged her as the inspiration for the former opera, telling her in a letter that &quot;I saw for the first time how a woman can love her husband… that was the reason why I took up Kát’a Kabanová and composed it&quot;. Likewise, during rehearsals for The Makropulos Affair, Janáček wrote to her that &quot;&quot;Mrs. Kerová, who is taking [the role of Emilia Marty], has movements like you… that lady seems just like you in her gait and her whole appearance&quot;”

Another work inspired by was &quot;The Diary of One Who Disappeared&quot; about which the composer wrote to her &quot;&quot;That black Gypsy girl in my Diary was especially you… That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so much emotional hea&quot;t. Other works she inspired include the &quot;Glagolitic Mass&quot;, the &quot;Sinfonietta&quot; and in particular the &quot;String Quartet No. 2&quot; (subtitled &quot;Intimate Letters&quot;). Not only is this last work dedicated to Stösslová, but the composer added a codicil to his will stipulating that she receive all of the royalties.

While many of these works reveal a realization by the composer that his love for her was unrequited, she was nonetheless the subject of intense correspondence. There are over 700 letters that bear witness to his intense obsession with Kamila. During the final year of his life, he wrote to Kamila almost every day. Although she always remained emotionally aloof, she was with him when he died in 1928.

In the award-winning TV film &quot;In Search of Janáček&quot;, written and directed by Petr Kaňka, her character was performed by Zuzana Vejvodová.

<doc id="1228949" wikidata="Q377493" url="?curid=1228949" title="Selective mutism">
<text>Selective mutism (SM) is an anxiety disorder in which a person who is otherwise capable of speech becomes unable to speak when exposed to specific situations, specific places, or to specific people, one or multiple of which serve as triggers. This is caused by the freeze response. Selective mutism usually co-exists with social anxiety disorder. People with selective mutism stay silent even when the consequences of their silence include shame, social ostracism, or punishment.

==Signs and symptoms==
Children and adults with selective mutism are fully capable of speech and understanding language but may be completely unable to speak in certain situations, even if speech is expected of them. This behaviour may be perceived as shyness for some or rudeness by others. A child with selective mutism may be completely silent at school for years but speak quite freely or even excessively at home. There is a hierarchical variation among people with this disorder: some people participate fully in activities and appear social but do not speak, others will speak only to peers but not to adults, others will speak to adults when asked questions requiring short answers but never to peers, and still others speak to no one and participate in few, if any, activities presented to them. In a severe form known as &quot;progressive mutism&quot;, the disorder progresses until the person with this condition no longer speaks to anyone in any situation, even close family members.

To meet DSM-5 criteria for selective mutism, one must exhibit the following:

* Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations (in which there is an expectation for speaking, e.g., at school) despite speaking in other situations.
* The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication.
* The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of school).
* The failure to speak is not due to a lack of knowledge of the spoken language required in the social situation.
* The disturbance is not better accounted for by a communication disorder (e.g., childhood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively in people with autism spectrum disorders or psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.

Selective mutism is strongly associated with other anxiety disorders, particularly social anxiety disorder. In fact, the majority of children diagnosed with selective mutism also have social anxiety disorder (100% of participants in two studies and 97% in another).&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1007/s10862-005-3263-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers therefore speculate that selective mutism may be an avoidance strategy used by a subgroup of children with social anxiety disorder to reduce their distress in social situations.

Particularly in young children, selective mutism can sometimes be conflated with an autism spectrum disorder, especially if the child acts particularly withdrawn around their diagnostician, which can lead to incorrect diagnosis and treatment. Although many autistic people are also selectively mute, they often display other behaviors—stimming, repetitive behaviors, social isolation even among family members (not always answering to name, for example)—that set them apart from a child with selective mutism alone. Some autistic people may be selectively mute due to anxiety in unfamiliar social situations. If mutism is entirely due to autism spectrum disorder, it cannot be diagnosed as selective mutism as stated in the last item on the list above.

The former name &quot;elective mutism&quot; indicates a widespread misconception among psychologists that selectively mute people choose to be silent in certain situations, while the truth is that they often wish to speak but are unable to do so. To reflect the involuntary nature of this disorder, the name was changed to &quot;selective mutism&quot; in 1994, although some people are calling for a name change to &quot;situational mutism&quot; because the current name can promote the belief that it is a behavior the individual selects rather than it occurring in certain situations.
The incidence of selective mutism is not certain. Due to the poor understanding of this condition by the general public, many cases are likely undiagnosed. Based on the number of reported cases, the figure is commonly estimated to be 1 in 1000, 0.1%. However, a 2002 study in &quot;The Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry&quot; estimated the incidence to be 0.71%.

===Other symptoms===
Besides lack of speech, other common behaviors and characteristics displayed by selectively mute people, according to Elisa Shipon-Blum&#x27;s findings, include:

* Shyness, social anxiety, fear of social embarrassment or social isolation and withdrawal
* Difficulty maintaining eye contact
* Blank expression and reluctance to smile or incessant smiling 
* Difficulty expressing feelings, even to family members
* Tendency to worry more than most people of the same age
* Sensitivity to noise and crowds

On the flip side, there are some positive traits observed in many cases:

* Above average intelligence, inquisitiveness, or perception
* A strong sense of right and wrong
* Creativity
* Love for the arts
* Empathy
* Sensitivity for other people

==Causes==
Selective mutism (SM) is an umbrella term for the condition of otherwise well-developed children or adults who cannot speak or communicate under certain settings. The exact causes that affect each person may be different and yet unknown. There have been attempts to categorize, but there are no definitive answers yet due to the under-diagnosis and small/biased sample sizes. Many people are not diagnosed until late in childhood only because they do not speak at school and therefore fail to accomplish assignments requiring public speaking. Their involuntary silence makes the condition harder to understand or test. Parents often are unaware of the condition since the children may be functioning well at home. Teachers and pediatricians also sometimes mistake it for severe shyness or common stage fright.

Most children and adults with selective mutism are hypothesized to have an inherited predisposition to anxiety. They often have inhibited temperaments, which is hypothesized to be the result of over-excitability of the area of the brain called the amygdala. This area receives indications of possible threats and sets off the fight-or-flight response. Behavioral inhibitions, or inhibited temperaments, encompass feelings of emotional distress and social withdrawals. In a 2016 study, the relationship between behavioral inhibition and selective mutism was investigated. Children between the ages of three and 19 with lifetime selective mutism, social phobia, internalizing behavior, and healthy controls were assessed using the parent-rated Retrospective Infant Behavioral Inhibition (RIBI) questionnaire, consisting of 20 questions that addressed shyness and fear, as well as other subscales. The results indicated behavioral inhibition does indeed predispose selective mutism. Corresponding with the researchers’ hypothesis, children diagnosed with long-term selective mutism had a higher behavioral inhibition score as an infant. This is indicative of the positive correlation between behavioral inhibition and selective mutism.

Given the very high incidence of social anxiety disorder within selective mutism (as high as 100% in some studies), it is possible that social anxiety disorder causes selective mutism. Some children or adults with selective mutism may have trouble processing sensory information. This could cause anxiety and a sense of being overwhelmed in unfamiliar situations, which may cause the child or adult to &quot;shut down&quot; and not be able to speak (something that some autistic people also experience). Many children or adults with selective mutism have some auditory processing difficulties.

About 20–30% of children or adults with selective mutism have speech or language disorders that add stress to situations in which the child is expected to speak. In the DSM-4, the term “elective mutism” was changed to “selective mutism.” This name change intended to deemphasize this refusal and oppositional aspect of the disorder. Instead, it highlighted that in select environments, the child is unable to speak rather than choosing not to. In fact, children with selective mutism have a lower rate of oppositional behavior than their peers in a school setting. Some previous studies on the subject of selective mutism have been dismissed as containing serious flaws in their design. According to a more recent systematic study it is believed that children or adults who have selective mutism are not more likely than other children or adults to have a history of early trauma or stressful life events. Many children or adults who have selective mutism almost always speak confidently in some situations.

==Treatment==
Contrary to popular belief, people with selective mutism do not necessarily improve with age. Effective treatment is necessary for a child to develop properly. Without treatment, selective mutism can contribute to chronic depression, further anxiety, and other social and emotional problems.

Consequently, treatment at an early age is important. If not addressed, selective mutism tends to be self-reinforcing. Others may eventually expect an affected child to not speak and therefore stop attempting to initiate verbal contact. Alternatively, they may pressure the child to talk, increasing their anxiety levels in situations where speech is expected. Due to these problems, a change of environment may be a viable consideration. However, changing school is worth considering only if the alternative environment is highly supportive, otherwise a whole new environment could also be a social shock for the individual or deprive them of any friends or support they have currently. Regardless of the cause, increasing awareness and ensuring an accommodating, supportive environment are the first steps towards effective treatment. Most often affected children do not have to change schools or classes and have no difficulty keeping up except on the communication and social front. Treatment in teenage or adult years can be more difficult because the affected individual has become accustomed to being mute, and lacks social skills to respond to social cues.

The exact treatment depends on the person&#x27;s age, any comorbid mental illnesses, and a number of other factors. For instance, stimulus fading is typically used with younger children because older children and teenagers recognize the situation as an attempt to make them speak, and older people with this condition and people with depression are more likely to need medication.

Like other disabilities, adequate accommodations are needed for those with the condition to succeed at school, work, and in the home. In the United States, under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a federal law, those with the disorder qualify for services based upon the fact that they have an impairment that hinders their ability to speak, thus disrupting their lives. This assistance is typically documented in the form of an Individualized Education Program (IEP). Post-secondary accommodations are also available for people with disabilities.

Under another law in the US, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, public school districts are required to provide a free, appropriate public education to every &quot;qualified handicapped person&quot; residing within their jurisdiction. If the child is found to have impairments that substantially limit a major life activity (in this case, learning), the education agency has to decide what related aids or services are required to provide equal access to the learning environment.

Social Communication Anxiety Treatment (S-CAT) is a common treatment approach by professionals and has proven to be successful. S-CAT integrates components of behavioral-therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and an insight-oriented approach to increase social communication and promote social confidence. Tactics such as systemic desensitization, modeling, fading, and positive reinforcement enable individuals to develop social engagement skills and begin to progress communicatively in a step-by-step manner. There are many treatment plans that exist and it is recommended for families to do thorough research before deciding on their treatment approach.

===Self-modeling===
An affected child is brought into the classroom or the environment where the child will not speak and is videotaped. First, the teacher or another adult prompts the child with questions that likely will not be answered. A parent, or someone the child feels comfortable speaking to, then replaces the prompter and asks the child the same questions, this time eliciting a verbal response. The two videos of the conversations are then edited together to show the child directly answering the questions posed by the teacher or other adult. This video is then shown to the child over a series of several weeks, and every time the child sees themself verbally answering the teacher/other adult, the tape is stopped and the child is given positive reinforcement.

Such videos can also be shown to affected children&#x27;s classmates to set an expectation in their peers that they can speak. The classmates thereby learn the sound of the child&#x27;s voice and, albeit through editing, have the opportunity to see the child conversing with the teacher.

===Mystery motivators===
Mystery motivation is often paired with self-modeling. An envelope is placed in the child&#x27;s classroom in a visible place. On the envelope, the child&#x27;s name is written along with a question mark. Inside is an item that the child&#x27;s parent has determined to be desirable to the child. The child is told that when they ask for the envelope loudly enough for the teacher and others in the classroom to hear, the child will receive the mystery motivator. The class is also told of the expectation that the child ask for the envelope loudly enough that the class can hear.

===Stimulus fading===
Affected subjects can be brought into a controlled environment with someone with whom they are at ease and can communicate. Gradually, another person is introduced into the situation. One example of stimulus fading is the &quot;sliding-in&quot; technique, where a new person is slowly brought into the talking group. This can take a long time for the first one or two faded-in people but may become faster as the patient gets more comfortable with the technique.

As an example, a child may be playing a board game with a family member in a classroom at school. Gradually, the teacher is brought in to play as well. When the child adjusts to the teacher&#x27;s presence, then a peer is brought in to be a part of the game. Each person is only brought in if the child continues to engage verbally and positively.

===Desensitization===
The subject communicates indirectly with a person to whom they are afraid to speak through such means as email, instant messaging (text, audio or video), online chat, voice or video recordings, and speaking or whispering to an intermediary in the presence of the target person. This can make the subject more comfortable with the idea of communicating with this person.

===Shaping===
The subject is slowly encouraged to speak. The subject is reinforced first for interacting nonverbally, then for saying certain sounds (such as the sound that each letter of the alphabet makes) rather than words, then for whispering, and finally saying a word or more.

===Spacing===
Spacing is important to integrate, especially with self-modeling. Repeated and spaced out use of interventions is shown to be the most helpful long-term for learning. Viewing videotapes of self-modeling should be shown over a spaced out period of time of approximately 6 weeks.

===Drug treatments===
Some practitioners believe there would be evidence indicating anxiolytics to be helpful in treating children and adults with selective mutism, to decrease anxiety levels and thereby speed the process of therapy. Use of medication may end after nine to twelve months, once the person has learned skills to cope with anxiety and has become more comfortable in social situations. Medication is more often used for older children, teenagers, and adults whose anxiety has led to depression and other problems.

Medication, when used, should never be considered the entire treatment for a person with selective mutism. However, the reason why medication needs to be considered as a treatment at all is because selective mutism is still prevalent, despite psychosocial efforts. But while on medication, the person should still be in therapy to help them learn how to handle anxiety and prepare them for life without medication, as medication is typically a short-term solution.

Since selective mutism is categorized as an anxiety disorder, using similar medication to treat either makes sense. Antidepressants have been used in addition to self-modeling and mystery motivation to aid in the learning process. Furthermore, SSRIs in particular have been used to treat selective mutism. In a systematic review, ten studies were looked at which involved SSRI medications, and all reported medication was well tolerated. In one of them, Black and Uhde (1994) conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigating the effects of fluoxetine. By parent report, fluoxetine-treated children showed significantly greater improvement than placebo-treated children. In another, Dummit III et al. (1996) administered fluoxetine to 21 children for nine weeks and found that 76% of the children had reduced or no symptoms by the end of the experiment. This indicates that fluoxetine is an SSRI that is indeed helpful in treating selective mutism.

==History==
In 1877, German physician Adolph Kussmaul described children who were able to speak normally but often refused to as having a disorder he named &quot;aphasia voluntaria&quot;. Although this is now an obsolete term, it was part of an early effort to describe the concept now called selective mutism.

In 1980, a study by Torey Hayden identified what she called four &quot;subtypes&quot; of elective mutism (as it was called then), although this set of subtypes is not in current diagnostic use. These subtypes are no longer recognized, though &quot;speech phobia&quot; is sometimes used to describe a selectively mute person who appears not to have any symptoms of social anxiety.

The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM), first published in 1952, first included selective mutism in its third edition, published in 1980. Selective mutism was described as &quot;a continuous refusal to speak in almost all social situations&quot; despite normal ability to speak. While &quot;excessive shyness&quot; and other anxiety-related traits were listed as associated features, predisposing factors included &quot;maternal overprotection&quot;, &quot;mental retardation&quot;, and trauma. Elective mutism in the third edition revised (DSM III-R) is described similarly to the third edition except for specifying that the disorder is &quot;not&quot; related to social phobia.

In 1994, Sue Newman, co-founder of the Selective Mutism Foundation, requested that the fourth edition of the DSM reflect the name change from elective mutism to selective mutism and describe the disorder as a &quot;failure&quot; to speak. The relation to anxiety disorders was emphasized, particularly in the revised version (DSM IV-TR). As part of the reorganization of the DSM categories, the DSM-5 moved selective mutism from the section &quot;Disorders Usually First Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, or Adolescence&quot; to the section for anxiety disorders.

<doc id="1228958" wikidata="Q2518938" url="?curid=1228958" title="Vought XF5U">
<text>The Vought XF5U &quot;Flying Flapjack&quot; was an experimental U.S. Navy fighter aircraft designed by Charles H. Zimmerman for Vought during World War II. This unorthodox design consisted of a flat, somewhat disc-shaped body (resembling a flying flapjack/pancake, hence its nickname) serving as the lifting surface. Two piston engines buried in the body drove propellers located on the leading edge, at the wingtips.

==Design and development==
A developed version of the original V-173 prototype, the XF5U-1 was a larger aircraft. Of all-metal construction, it was almost five times heavier, with two 1,400 hp (1,193 kW) Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2000 radial engines. The configuration was designed to create a low aspect ratio aircraft with low takeoff and landing speeds but high top speed. The aircraft was designed to keep the low stall speed and high angle of attack from the V-173 prototype while providing for better pilot visibility, cockpit comfort, less vibration, and provisions to install armament. This included a cockpit redesign moving the cockpit from the leading edge of the wing to a nose nacelle that extended further in front of the leading edge. The arrestor hook was changed to a dorsal hook that would diminish the drag from the apparatus.

 Normally, a wing with such a low aspect ratio will suffer from very poor performance due to the degree of induced drag created at the wingtips, as the higher pressure air below spills around the wingtip to the lower-pressure region above. In a conventional aircraft, these wingtip vortices carry a lot of energy with them and hence create drag. The usual approach to reducing these vortices is to build a wing with a high aspect ratio, i.e. one that is long and narrow. However, such wings compromise the maneuverability and roll rate of the aircraft, or present a structural challenge in building them stiff enough. The XF5U attempted to overcome the tip vortex problem using the propellers to actively cancel the drag-causing tip vortices. The propellers are arranged to rotate in the opposite direction to the tip vortices, with the aim of retaining the higher-pressure air below the wing. With this source of drag eliminated, the aircraft would fly with a much smaller wing area, and the small wing would yield high maneuverability with greater structural strength.

The propellers envisioned for the completed fighter — unlike the torque-reducing counter-rotating propellers of the V-173 design — were to have a built-in cyclic movement like a helicopter&#x27;s main rotor, with a very limited ability to shift their center of lift up and down to aid the aircraft in maneuvering. Initially, the aircraft used propellers originally designed for the V-173 prototype. These propellers would be replaced with propellers taken from the Vought F4U-4 Corsair. An ejection seat was fitted to allow the pilot to clear the massive propellers in the event of an in-flight emergency. Although the prototype was unarmed, a combination of six M2 Browning 50-caliber machine guns or four M3 20 mm cannons would be mounted in the wing roots in service.

==Testing and evaluation==
The XF5U design was promising: specifications given at the time promised great maneuverability and speeds up to 452 mph (727 km/h). However, it came at the time when the United States Navy was switching from propeller driven to jet propelled aircraft. By 1946, the XF5U-1 project was already long over its expected development time, and well over budget. With jet aircraft coming into service, the Navy finally canceled the project on 17 March 1947, and the prototype aircraft (V-173) was transferred to the Smithsonian Museum for display. Although two aircraft were constructed, a lone XF5U-1 underwent ground runs but never overcame vibration problems. Taxi trials at Vought&#x27;s Connecticut factory culminated in short &quot;hops&quot; that were not true flights. The only completed XF5U-1 proved to be so structurally solid that it had to be destroyed with a wrecking ball.

<doc id="1228965" wikidata="Q865977" url="?curid=1228965" title="Coat of arms of Puerto Rico">
<text>The coat of arms of Puerto Rico was first granted by the Spanish Crown on November 8, 1511, making it the oldest heraldic achievement in use in the Americas. The territory was seized from Spain and ceded to the United States as a result of the Treaty of Paris that put an end to the Spanish–American War in 1899, after which two interim arms were adopted briefly. A law was passed in 1905 that reestablished the historical armorial bearings as the arms of the territory. Then in 1976, after numerous investigations and amendments, the current version was adopted.

== History ==

The main element of the coat of arms of Puerto Rico is the Lamb of God. Despite Puerto Rico being a US territory, the shield continues to have elements reminiscent of Spain&#x27;s presence in the New World. There have been different variations of the coat of arms throughout Puerto Rico&#x27;s history. The current version was officially readopted by the government of Puerto Rico on 3 June 1976.

== Features ==
==Great Seal==
All of the states and territories of the United States employ a seal to authenticate and ratify documents and accordingly a seal of Puerto Rico exists, but the traditional coat of arms is used as the main emblem of the territory. The seal has most of the elements of the coat of arms, but the religious elements have been stripped away in accordance with the separation of church and state in the United States. In the seal, the lamb, which no longer has a halo, carries a white banner instead of one with a Red Cross. The book the lamb sits on does not have the seals of the Book of Revelation. The first Governors used the seal as their emblem but in recent years the usage of the seal has been limited to being the official emblem used to represent Puerto Rico on its legal documents when they are sealed.

==Seal of the governor==
The seal of the governor is the official symbol of the executive head of Puerto Rico. It follows the design used by the seal of the president of the United States. There are several variants of the governor&#x27;s seal in use.

==Seals of the government of Puerto Rico==
There are several seals of the different sections of the Puerto Rican government.

<doc id="1228972" wikidata="Q3835857" url="?curid=1228972" title="The Dirty Fork">
<text>The Dirty Fork, also known simply as Restaurant Sketch, is a Monty Python sketch that appeared in episode 3 of the first series of the television series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, and later in the film, &quot;And Now For Something Completely Different&quot;. It is notable for being the first Monty Python sketch wherein the characters react to the audience &quot;booing&quot; them.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; has ranked &quot;The Restaurant Sketch&quot; as one of Monty Python&#x27;s top 20 sketches. In England, it is used in approved course materials for Key Stage 2 of the state school curriculum.

==Synopsis==
A man (Graham Chapman) and his wife (Carol Cleveland) are enjoying a night out at an expensive French restaurant. The man discovers that he has been given a dirty fork and politely asks Gaston the waiter to replace it.

Gaston (Terry Jones) apologizes profusely and runs to get the head waiter, Gilberto (Michael Palin). Gilberto arrives, demands that the entire washing-up staff be fired, tells Gaston to report this news to the manager immediately, and recoils in disgust at the fork.

The manager (Eric Idle) arrives, tells Gilberto to relax, then sits down at the table and apologizes &quot;humbly, deeply, and sincerely&quot; for the dirty fork. He becomes emotional when explaining the problems the restaurant staff has been suffering, and bursts into tears. Mungo the cook (John Cleese) enters, berating the couple for criticizing such a vulnerable man, and swings his cleaver onto their table. Gilberto clutches his head, complaining about his &quot;war wound&quot;. The manager stabs himself in the stomach with the dirty fork, screaming &quot;It&#x27;s the end! The end!&quot; and collapses to the ground dead.

Mungo lifts his knife over Chapman and cries, &quot;Revenge!&quot; Gilberto rounds the corner and grabs the angry cook just in time. &quot;Mungo!&quot; he gasps, &quot;Mungo, never kill a customer!&quot; Gilberto dies from his war wound. Mungo raises his knife again, but Gaston tackles him before he can kill Chapman. A caption reads, &quot;And Now… The Punchline!&quot;

&quot;Lucky we didn&#x27;t say anything about the dirty knife,&quot; Chapman says into the camera. The audience then boos as Chapman objects to it.

There are several changes to the sketch in the &quot;And Now For Something Completely Different&quot; version. The waiter is named &quot;Giuseppe&quot; instead of &quot;Gaston&quot;. There&#x27;s no audience and the actors do not boo when Chapman delivers the &quot;punchline&quot; which was changed slightly to &quot;Lucky I didn&#x27;t tell them about the dirty knife&quot;.

==Writing style==
This sketch reflects Python&#x27;s thoughts about punch lines. The Monty Python troupe had decided from the start that they were going to throw away punchlines, and this was a play on the shows that would use corny lines like the dirty knife. Most Python sketches just end abruptly, and sometimes even characters say &quot;What a stupid sketch&quot; and walk out. In &quot;Monty Python Live in Aspen&quot;, Terry Gilliam explains:

Ironically, the episode the sketch appeared in concludes with the sketch &quot;Candid Photography&quot; (better known as &quot;Nudge Nudge&quot;), which concludes with a punch line.

Yuen Wah (born Yung Kai-chi; 2 September 1950) is a Hong Kong action film actor, action choreographer, stuntman and martial artist who has appeared in over 160 films and over 20 television series.

==Early life==
Born Yung Kai-chi on 2 September 1950 in Hong Kong, Kai attended the China Drama Academy, a Peking opera school in Hong Kong in the late 1950s and 1960s. He was instructed by Master Yu Jim Yuen and became a member of the Seven Little Fortunes along with fellow students including Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao, Yuen Qiu and Corey Yuen. Like the other students, he took his sifu&#x27;s given name – &quot;Yuen&quot;. In his biography, Jackie Chan stated that Yuen Wah&#x27;s martial arts ability was well respected among his fellow students. After leaving the opera school, many of the students entered the Hong Kong film industry. Yuen Wah was given an anglicised stagename, &quot;Sam Yuen&quot;, but like Yuen Biao (Bill Yuen / Jimmy Yuen), the name was not used. Rather than reverting to their birth names, both retained their opera school names, as did several other former students.

==Career==
Known for his agility and acrobatic skills, Yuen Wah began his film career working as Bruce Lee&#x27;s stunt double in the films &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (1972) and &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973). He also made his acting debut in &quot;Fist of Fury&quot;, as a Japanese man who asks Bruce Lee&#x27;s character to crawl like a dog and is soundly beaten for it. He began to receive a number of roles in Shaw Brothers films.

Yuen&#x27;s versatility, his lean, wiry frame and later, his distinctive moustache often saw him cast as the villain in most films. During the 1980s, he worked on several films with former classmates Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, both in an action director / stunt co-ordinator capacity, and in acting roles as villainous characters. The films included &quot;Mr. Vampire&quot; (1985), &quot;My Lucky Stars&quot; (1985), &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Express&quot; (1986), &quot;Eastern Condors&quot; (1986), and &quot;Dragons Forever&quot; (1988).

During the 1990s, whilst still appearing in a number of films, Yuen began to focus on television series roles for TVB. In 1996, he starred as a Taoist priest fighting jiangshi vampires in the series &quot;The Night Journey&quot;. His comical and endearingly scrooge-like image earned him popularity on the Hong Kong television circuit. Since then, he has appeared in over 20 different television series.

In 2004, Yuen was cast as the Landlord in Stephen Chow&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Kung Fu Hustle&quot;. During the 2005 Hong Kong Film Awards, his colleagues took the opportunity to award him with the award for Best Supporting Actor.

Yuen made his debut in an English language film in &quot;Aiming High&quot; in 1998. He appeared in another English language production, the 2008 Baz Luhrmann period film &quot;Australia&quot;, alongside Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. He played a supporting role in the 2021 Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot;.

Yuen Wah has starred in more than 60 films and worked on over 160. In the early 1970s, Yuen worked as a stuntman and extra, later progressing to stunt coordinator / action director roles, as well as full-fledged acting parts.

During the 1980s he made a number of appearances, primarily as villainous characters in the films of his former-China Drama Academy friends, Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao.

From the mid-1990s, Yuen embarked on a television career in Hong Kong. To date, he has appeared in 23 different series for broadcaster TVB. He also appeared in a show for Taiwanese channel CTS – a remake of the film &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story&quot; titled &quot;&quot;.

Yuen is credited as an actor in over 180 films and as a martial arts director for over 40 films.

<doc id="1228983" wikidata="Q410862" url="?curid=1228983" title="Mucin">
<text>Mucins () are a family of high molecular weight, heavily glycosylated proteins (glycoconjugates) produced by epithelial tissues in most animals. Mucins&#x27; key characteristic is their ability to form gels; therefore they are a key component in most gel-like secretions, serving functions from lubrication to cell signalling to forming chemical barriers. They often take an inhibitory role. Some mucins are associated with controlling mineralization, including nacre formation in mollusks, calcification in echinoderms and bone formation in vertebrates. They bind to pathogens as part of the immune system. Overexpression of the mucin proteins, especially MUC1, is associated with many types of cancer.

Although some mucins are membrane-bound due to the presence of a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain that favors retention in the plasma membrane, most mucins are secreted as principal components of mucus by mucous membranes or are secreted to become a component of saliva.

==Genes and proteins==
Human mucins include genes with the HUGO symbol MUC 1 through 22. Of these mucins, the following classes have been defined by localization:

* Secreted mucins in humans, with their chromosomal location, repeat size in amino acids (aa), whether they are gel-forming (Y) or not (N), and their tissue expression.

* Membrane-bound (transmembrane) mucins: MUC1, MUC3A, MUC3B, MUC4, MUC12, MUC13, MUC15, MUC16, MUC17, MUC21 (formerly C6orf205), MUC22 (highly polymorphic)

The major secreted airway mucins are MUC5AC and MUC5B, while MUC2 is secreted mostly in the intestine but also in the airway. MUC7 is the major salivary protein.

==Protein structure==
Mature mammalian mucins are composed of two distinct regions:

* The amino- and carboxy-terminal regions are very lightly glycosylated, but rich in cysteines. The cysteine residues participate in establishing disulfide linkages within and among mucin monomers.
* A large central region (&quot;PTS domain&quot;) formed of multiple tandem repeats of 10 to 80 residue sequences in which up to half of the amino acids are serine or threonine. This area becomes saturated with hundreds of O-linked oligosaccharides. N-linked oligosaccharides are also found on mucins, but in less abundance than O-linked sugars.

== Evolutionary classification ==
The functional classification does not correspond to an exact evolutionary relationship, which is still incomplete and ongoing. Known-related groups include:

* The gel-forming mucins (2, 5AC, 5B, 6, 19) are related both to each other and to otogelin and von Willebrand Factor (PTHR11339). Four of these occur in a well-conserved gene cluster (at 11p.15.5 in humans).
* The EGF-like domain containing mucins. These include MUC3(A,B), MUC4, MUC12, MUC13, and MUC17.
* Some EGF-like mucins, plus MUC1 and MUC16, carry SEA domains, a vertebrate invention. It is unclear whether this points to a common origin among these transmembrane mucins.
* MUC21 and MUC22 are related to each other by sharing a C-terminal domain (PF14654). They also occur in a human gene cluster on 6p21.33.
* MUC7 is a recent invention in placental mammals. It started as a copy in the secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) gene cluster and rapidly gained PTS repeats.

== Function in humans ==
Mucins have been found to have important functions in defense against bacterial and fungal infections. MUC5B, the predominant mucin in the mouth and female genital tract, has been shown to significantly reduce attachment and biofilm formation of &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;, a bacterium with the potential to form cavities. Unusually, MUC5B does not kill the bacteria but rather maintains it in the planktonic (non-biofilm) phase, thus maintaining a diverse and healthy oral microbiome. Similar effects of MUC5B and other mucins have been demonstrated with other pathogens, such as &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, &quot;Helicobacter pylori,&quot; and even HIV. In the mouth, mucins can also recruit anti-microbial proteins such as statherins and histatine 1, which further reduces risk of infection.

Eleven mucins are expressed by the eye surface epithelia, goblet cells and associated glands, even though most of them are expressed at very low levels. They maintain wetness, lubricate the blink, stabilize the tear film, and create a physical barrier to the outside world.

==Glycosylation and aggregation==
Mucin genes encode mucin monomers that are synthesized as rod-shaped apomucin cores that are post-translationally modified by exceptionally abundant glycosylation.

The dense &quot;sugar coating&quot; of mucins gives them considerable water-holding capacity and also makes them resistant to proteolysis, which may be important in maintaining mucosal barriers.

Mucins are secreted as massive aggregates of proteins with molecular masses of roughly 1 to 10 million Da. Within these aggregates, monomers are linked to one another mostly by non-covalent interactions, although intermolecular disulfide bonds may also play a role in this process.

==Secretion==
Upon stimulation, MARCKS (myristylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate) protein coordinates the secretion of mucin from mucin-filled vesicles within the specialized epithelial cells. Fusion of the vesicles to the plasma membrane causes release of the mucin, which as it exchanges Ca2+ for Na+ expands up to 600 fold. The result is a viscoelastic product of interwoven molecules which, combined with other secretions (e.g., from the airway epithelium and the submucosal glands in the respiratory system), is called mucus.

==Clinical significance==
Increased mucin production occurs in many adenocarcinomas, including cancers of the pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, colon and other tissues. Mucins are also overexpressed in lung diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis. Two membrane mucins, MUC1 and MUC4 have been extensively studied in relation to their pathological implication in the disease process. Mucins are under investigation as possible diagnostic markers for malignancies and other disease processes in which they are most commonly over- or mis-expressed.

Abnormal deposits of mucin are responsible for the non-pitting facial edema seen in untreated hypothyroidism. This edema is seen in the pretibial area as well.

== Non-vertebrate mucins ==
Beyond the better-studied vertebrate mucins, other animals also express (not necessarily related) proteins with similar properties. These include:

* &quot;Drosophila&quot; is known to express mucin proteins containing PTS-rich repeats.
* &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot; express cell-surface mucins ().

Some other organisms produce mucilage that does not have a protein component, only polysacchides.

==Cosmetic use==
Misuse of skincare products containing snail secretions of mucin have resulted in pain, swelling, and oozing. Counterfeit versions of a Korean snail mucin product called COSRX have been selling online, putting users at risk. It’s important to follow manufacturer guidelines on their use and buy skin products from authorized vendors.

<text>Raven Arms was a firearms manufacturer established in 1970 by firearms designer George Jennings. The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibiting the importation of inexpensive handguns prompted Jennings to design the MP-25, a .25-caliber semi-automatic pistol, and enter the firearms business. Raven has been referred to as the original &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; company, a term describing companies known for producing inexpensive Saturday night special handguns.

Raven kept manufacturing costs to a minimum by building their guns from injection-molded zamak, a zinc alloy.

==History==
Before Jennings developed the MP-25, a friend who owned a pawn shop that sold firearms complained to Jennings that his supply of inexpensive imported handguns (typically made by Röhm Gesellschaft) had been cut off due to the Gun Control Act of 1968, resulting in a significant loss of sales. At the time, Jennings operated a machine shop that made parts for Southern California aerospace companies. Jennings established Raven Arms to produce the first Raven, the P-25 for his friend, and over the next 20 years, the company sold approximately two million variations of the pistols. The first variation of the Raven had a large button sliding safety on the side, and was manufactured in Baldwin Park, California. The second variation changed the safety to a smaller sliding safety, but retained the designation of P-25, and was manufactured in Industry, California (as were all other subsequent Ravens). The third variation changed the design of the pistol slide serrations and was designated the MP-25. The fourth and final variation of the pistol removed the sliding safety and changed it to an upward moving disk safety and retained the designation MP-25. In parallel with this growth, gun-control advocates started pushing legislation in Washington, in state capitals, and in city councils to ban inexpensive weapons.

In November 1991, a fire destroyed the Raven Arms factory. Jennings retired and sold his designs to Phoenix Arms. Phoenix was owned in equal shares by Jennings&#x27;s ex-wife, his children, four of his grandchildren, and by Raven&#x27;s former general manager. Phoenix continued to produce the MP-25 as the &quot;Model Raven&quot; and introduced a magazine safety disconnect which rendered the pistol unable to fire without a magazine inserted Phoenix was run under the management of Jennings&#x27;s son Bruce, and developed additional .22 and .25-caliber pistols, called the HP22 and HP25.

==MP-25==
===Description and Operation===

The MP-25 can hold six .25 ACP rounds in the magazine, plus one in the chamber, and is finished in chrome, satin nickel or black. The grips can be either wood or imitation mother-of-pearl handles. There is a similar model called the Raven Arms P-25. Both have similar blowback and envelope designs and are essentially identical firearms.

Early models have a sliding bar safety that will not allow the pistol to chamber a round or cock the striker if the safety is not in the fire position when the slide is pulled back. Later models have a push up safety that will not allow the action to be cycled at all when engaged.

The firing pin also acts as the ejector. It protrudes from its hole when the slide nears the end of its rearward travel, contacting the spent case and sending it up and out of the pistol. The gun&#x27;s fixed sights are cast into the top of the slide. The trigger pull is fairly stiff, at about 8 pounds, 6 ounces.

===Conflicting Views===
There are conflicting views on the MP-25. Critics refer to it by the pejorative term &quot;Saturday night special&quot;, as it is both easily concealed and affordable enough that the poor can afford to purchase it. However, Roy Innis, president of the activist group Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), rejected the pejorative term: &quot;To make inexpensive guns impossible to get is to say that you&#x27;re putting a money test on getting a gun. It&#x27;s racism in its worst form.&quot; Some advocates of the pistol say that it is reliable, despite its low cost. 

Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners (AFTE) reported that a Phoenix Arms Model Raven with an altered or damaged sear tip discharged unintentionally when the safety was moved &quot;off&quot; after the trigger had been pulled with the safety &quot;on&quot;.

===Criminal uses===
*An MP-25 was used in the 24 April 1998 Parker Middle School dance shooting. The shooter shot two teachers (one fatally) and two students with his father&#x27;s pistol.
*Serial killer Robert Lee Yates shot his victims with two MP-25s.
*Mark Orrin Barton used an MP-25 and several other handguns in his killing spree in Atlanta and Stockbridge, Georgia, on July 29, 1999, before killing himself. The MP-25 had been purchased from a pawnshop by someone else in 1991.

<doc id="1228993" wikidata="Q1290493" url="?curid=1228993" title="Saucy Jacky postcard">
<text>The &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard is the name given to a postcard received by the Central News Agency of London and postmarked 1 October 1888. The author of the postcard claims to have been the unidentified serial killer known as Jack the Ripper.

Because so many hoax letters were received by Scotland Yard, the press and others, it is unknown whether this was an authentic letter written by the Whitechapel murderer. The postcard did contain information deemed compelling enough to lead investigators to publish a facsimile of the communication in hopes that someone might recognise the handwriting.

==Text==

Postmarked and received on 1 October 1888, the postcard mentions that the two victims murdered on 30 September, Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes, were both killed in the early morning of 30 September and that the author had insufficient time to sever his victim&#x27;s ears to send to the police as promised in a previous letter received by the Central News Agency. The lobe and auricle of Eddowes&#x27; right ear was found detached at the crime scene as a result of facial mutilations that the killer had performed, although this was not public knowledge.

The text of the postcard reads:
Some authors have argued that the postcard was sent before the murders were publicised, making it unlikely that any hoaxer would have such knowledge of the crime; however the correspondence was postmarked more than 24 hours after the killings had occurred, and long after many details of the murders were known by journalists and residents of the area.

==Later revelations==
Police officials later claimed to have identified a specific journalist as the author of this postcard and the earlier &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter. In 1931, journalist Fred Best of &quot;The Star&quot; claimed he and a colleague at the newspaper had written all the letters signed &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; in order to &quot;keep the business alive&quot;.

In the years after the Ripper murders, the Saucy Jacky postcard disappeared from the police files. Although the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter was recovered in 1987, the &quot;Saucy Jacky&quot; postcard is still missing.

In 2018, a forensic linguistic analysis found strong linguistic evidence suggesting that this postcard and the &quot;Dear Boss&quot; letter were written by the same person.

<text>A school bus contractor is a private company or proprietorship that provides student transport services to a school district or non-public school. Of the 450,000 school buses operating in the United States, it is estimated that approximately 39% are operated by school bus contractors. In Canada (with some still operated by the school boards) and the United Kingdom, almost all school transportation is performed by contractors. 

A school bus contractor may range in size from an individual driver with a single bus, to a small company serving a single school or district, to a large multi-national company with as many as 60,000 buses. 

Major school bus contractors currently operating in the United States and Canada include First Student, National Express, and Student Transportation Inc.

<text>The Canicattì massacre (or Canicattì slaughter) was a massacre that occurred in Canicattì, Italy following its capture by American forces. During the invasion of Sicily in July 1943, eight unarmed Italian civilians were killed by U.S. troops. The town of Canicattì had already surrendered when U.S. troops entered, following heavy German bombardment during their withdrawal.

==History==
Upon arrival, U.S. troops received a report that civilians were looting a bombed factory and filling up buckets with the factory&#x27;s products: food and liquid soap. At around six o&#x27;clock in the evening, Lieutenant Colonel George Herbert McCaffrey, the military governor of Palermo, and some military police arrived at the factory. McCaffrey fired into the crowd after it had failed to disperse. At least eight civilians, including an eleven-year-old girl, were killed though the exact number of casualties is uncertain.

McCaffrey, 63, died of a heart attack in New Jersey on January 25, 1954. He&#x27;d been undergoing treatment for tuberculosis at the time of his death.

The incident remained virtually unknown until Joseph S. Salemi of New York University, whose father witnessed it, publicized information about it.

<doc id="1229021" wikidata="Q796261" url="?curid=1229021" title="BLU-109 bomb">
<text>The BLU-109/B is a hardened bunker buster penetration bomb used by the United States Air Force (BLU is an acronym for Bomb Live Unit). As with other &quot;bunker busters&quot;, it is intended to penetrate concrete shelters and other hardened structures before exploding. In addition to the US, it is part of the armament of the air forces of Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Israel, Netherlands, Norway,Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, and United Arab Emirates.

==Design==
The BLU-109/B has a steel casing about thick. Its warhead is filled with of tritonal. It has a mechanical-electrical delayed-action FMU-143 tail-fuze. 

The BLU-109 entered service in 1985. It is also used as the warhead of some marks of the GBU-15 electro-optically guided bomb, the GBU-24 Paveway III and GBU-27 Paveway III laser-guided bombs, as well as the GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) and AGM-130 air-to-surface missile.

==Variants==
The BLU-118 is reportedly a thermobaric explosive filler variation on the BLU-109 casing and basic bomb design. It contains PBXIH-135, a traditional explosive.

In 2015, General Dynamics started a $7.2 million development of a version called HAMMER, which is intended to destroy chemical and biological substances by spreading dozens of Kinetic Fireballs Incendiaries (KFI) (not explosions) inside a bunker. The KFIs evolved out of the earlier Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program by Exquadrum, Inc. of Adelanto, California.

==Operators==
The BLU-109 has been sold to key US allies including South Korea, Israel, Greece, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Pakistan, and Turkey

==Operational history==
In late 2023, the United States delivered 100 BLU-109 bombs to Israel. Israeli F-15I fighter jets are believed to have used BLU-109s with JDAM guidance kits in the strikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut on 27 September 2024.

<doc id="1229022" wikidata="Q4634510" url="?curid=1229022" title="30 Minute Meals">
<text>30 Minute Meals is a Food Network television series hosted by Rachael Ray. Her first of four shows on Food Network, its original run aired from November 17, 2001, until May 5, 2012. The show specializes in convenience cooking for those with little time to cook. The show is recorded live-to-tape, with Ray doing almost all preparation in real time. The show was awarded an Emmy for Best Daytime Service Show in 2006.

A common feature on the program is the creation of new versions of classic dishes like clam chowder or macaroni and cheese, some of which are traditionally slow to cook. Ray focuses on creating meals in less than 30 minutes.
Ray has also done two specials with the title &quot;Thanksgiving in 60&quot;, about preparing a Thanksgiving dinner in one hour.

Each episode Ray opens the show by saying &quot;Hi there, I&#x27;m Rachael Ray and I make 30-minute meals. Now that means in the time it takes you to watch this program, I will have made a delicious and healthy meal from start to finish.&quot;

A 30-episode revival was announced on January 25, 2019 and began airing on April 1, 2019.

== About the show ==

Rachael Ray&#x27;s &quot;30 Minute Meals&quot;, based on the cookbook series, debuted on November 17, 2001, and ended production in 2012, then was revived in 2019. After writing and releasing her cookbook in 1999, Rachael Ray went on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; to make soup with Al Roker. Two weeks later, she had two pilot shows on TV.

== Criticism of the show ==

Criticism of Rachael Ray&#x27;s show has been levied despite its successes. Ray had no formal cooking experience, leading to complaints about the appearance of her food.

Charlie Dougiello, Ray&#x27;s director of publicity stated, &quot;Rachael always says that some of the criticisms of her as a chef are correct. She is not a chef. She whips up meals in a way some chefs would cringe at. If she slips up, she slips up. We don&#x27;t stop taping. It is just like life.&quot;

== Books ==

The TV series has also led to a group of cookbooks.

Since the original &quot;30 Minute Meals: Comfort Foods&quot;
came out, several other books have also been published:

<doc id="1229025" wikidata="Q1211760" url="?curid=1229025" title="The Brethren (Grisham novel)">
<text>The Brethren is a 2000 legal thriller novel by American author John Grisham.

==Plot==
The &quot;Brethren&quot; are three former judges who are incarcerated at Trumble, a fictional federal minimum security prison located in northern Florida. The trio embark on a scam to deceive and exploit wealthy closeted gay men. None of them is gay, but they write convincingly as two young vulnerable gay men, developing friendships and then asking for financial help. In some cases, they also try blackmail.

With the help of their lawyer, Trevor Carson, they transfer their ill-gotten money to a secret Bahamian bank account. Carson takes one-third and employs private detectives to investigate the victims of the scam. This takes over from Carson&#x27;s normal legal business, which had been making very little money for him.

Meanwhile, Teddy Maynard, the ruthless and soon-to-retire director of the CIA, is orchestrating a scheme to tip the United States presidential election in the favor of Aaron Lake, a hawkish congressman supported by arms manufacturers. However, Lake, who is closeted, is hooked by the unwitting Brethren in their scam. Realizing that Lake stands to be exposed, Maynard scrambles to stop them from finding out the truth. After the Brethren fire Carson, he is killed by CIA agents in the Caribbean.

The CIA plant a man inside Trumble, who tells the Brethren that he knows about the scam. A deal is worked out, money changes hands and the judges are pardoned by the outgoing president at Maynard&#x27;s insistence. The judges leave the country and travel to Europe, where they later restart the scam. Meanwhile, Lake is elected and Maynard, eager to finish the cover-up, selects for him a suitable First Lady.

==Reception==
In a starred review, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; highlighted how Grisham is one of &quot;only a few megaselling authors of popular fiction [who] deviate dramatically from formula&quot;. In line with this praise, they noted that &quot;Grisham&#x27;s fans may miss the stalwart lawyer-heroes and David vs. Goliath slant of his earlier work&quot;, given the fact that &quot;every personage in this novel lies, cheats, steals and/or kills&quot;; however, they concluded that &quot;all will be captivated by this clever thriller that presents as crisp a cast as he&#x27;s yet devised, and as grippingly sardonic yet bitingly moral a scenario as he&#x27;s ever imagined&quot;.

The A.V. Club&#x27;s Tasha Robinson also discussed how &quot;&quot;The Brethren&quot; presents a curious speed bump in [Grishman&#x27;s] decade-long ride on literary cruise control&quot;, adding that, &quot;most notably, there isn&#x27;t a single film-friendly hero here&quot;.

While &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; referred to the plot as &quot;expertly orchestrated and very complex plot&quot;, Robinson argued that &quot;Grisham takes his time&quot; connecting seemingly disconnected plot lines, and &quot;even when the book finally coheres, the fireworks are minimal&quot;.

Robinson concluded, &quot;&quot;The Brethren&quot; isn&#x27;t especially exciting, nor is it especially glib. But it is suspiciously relevant to the current presidential election, as well as a satisfying break from Grisham-as-usual.&quot;

<text>Ralph Summers Plaisted (September 30, 1927 – September 8, 2008) was an American explorer who, with his three companions, Walt Pederson, Gerry Pitzl and Jean-Luc Bombardier, are regarded by most polar authorities to be the first to succeed in a surface traverse across the ice to the North Pole on April 19, 1968, making the first confirmed surface conquest of the Pole.

==Background==

Plaisted was a high-school dropout from Bruno, Minnesota, who found success as an insurance salesman. An avid outdoorsman, in the early 1960s he was one of the first Minnesotans to buy a Ski-Doo snowmobile, a then-novel invention of Canada&#x27;s Bombardier Company, and became a convert and promoter of the machine. In 1965, Plaisted drove his snowmobile from Ely to White Bear Lake, Minnesota in one day, which is regarded as the first long-distance snowmobile trek.

==Arctic expedition==
Plaisted and his friend Art Aufderheide conceived the idea of reaching the North Pole by snowmobile in the spring of 1966, aiming to make the trip the following year. Gordon Mikkelson (1929-1990) helped with snowmobiling and base camp logistics. Customized clothing was assembled for the team, which they tested by sleeping on a frozen lake in northern Minnesota. In April and May 1967, Plaisted&#x27;s first attempt was thwarted at 83° 20&#x27; latitude by storms and open water. The attempt resulted in a CBS-TV documentary &quot;To the Top of the World,&quot; reported by Charles Kuralt, who accompanied the Plaisted team.

Plaisted returned for a successful attempt the following year in March 1968. Starting at Canada&#x27;s Ward Hunt Island just a few miles from Peary&#x27;s start at Cape Columbia on Ellesmere Island, Plaisted began the traverse on March 9.

Navigating with a sextant and resupplied when possible with fuel and supplies dropped by a turboprop DeHavilland Twin Otter, the expedition members spent 43 days, 11 hours traveling on the ice before reaching their final camp on the evening of April 19. Navigator Jerry Pitzl made hourly sextant sightings over the next two days to confirm their location. On the morning of April 20, the party journeyed somewhat less than to account for ice drift, and signaled a United States Air Force C-135 weather reconnaissance aircraft using a handheld radio. At 10:30 am Eastern Daylight Time, the aircraft, call sign LARK-47, flew overhead confirming the party was exactly at the North Pole. The party was then flown out.

Given the doubts surrounding the North Pole conquest claims of Robert Peary and Frederick Cook, Ralph Plaisted&#x27;s journey, the Plaisted Polar Expedition, is regarded as the first undisputed surface conquest of the North Pole. Affidavits signed by resupply pilots Welland Phipps and Ken Lee confirm that the expedition did not cover any distance by air.

<text>John Turner (12 August 1947 – 1 May 2002), known professionally as John Nathan-Turner, was an English television producer. He was the ninth producer of the long-running BBC science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and the final producer of the series&#x27; first run on television (from 1980 until it was cancelled in 1989). He finished the role having become the longest-serving &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer and cast Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy as the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, respectively.

==Early life==
Born John Turner in Birmingham, he adopted the double-barrelled stage name &quot;John Nathan-Turner&quot; to distinguish himself from the British actor John Turner. He was educated at King Edward VI School, at Aston in Birmingham, where he showed an early interest in acting and theatre. His earliest television acting work was as an extra in TV productions for ITV, including &quot;Crossroads&quot; and &quot;The Flying Swan&quot;. Both shows were made in Birmingham (the former at ATV&#x27;s Aston studios). On leaving school, he initially worked as an actor and assistant stage manager at Birmingham&#x27;s Alexandra Theatre.

Turner was later taken on by the BBC as a television floor assistant, working on every type of show (from light entertainment to news and current affairs), including–more importantly for his later career–drama. Shows produced by the BBC&#x27;s drama department that he worked on included &quot;The Pallisers&quot;, &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;, &quot;Angels&quot;, and &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;. An assignment to the BBC&#x27;s light entertainment department also led to him spending two years working on &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot;, prior to the act&#x27;s move to ITV in 1978.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
Having joined the BBC as a floor assistant in the 1960s, he first worked on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1969 as part of the floor crew at a time when the series was recorded in Studio D at the BBC&#x27;s Lime Grove Studios. The first serial he worked on was the Patrick Troughton story &quot;The Space Pirates&quot; in 1969.

Nathan-Turner worked as an assistant floor manager on two serials in the Jon Pertwee era of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;: &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot; (1970) and &quot;Colony in Space&quot; (1971). He later worked on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the Tom Baker era as production unit manager under producer Graham Williams from 1977 to 1979. When Williams decided to leave the show after three seasons and the BBC management&#x27;s first choice to replace him, George Gallaccio, turned it down, he accepted the post of producer for season 18, which would also become the last to feature Baker as the Fourth Doctor.

Due to Nathan-Turner&#x27;s relatively young age at 33 and lack of previous experience as a producer, the BBC brought former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer Barry Letts back to the series to act as executive producer for his first season. Nathan-Turner&#x27;s experience of working with Graham Williams helped form his views on the future direction of the series. He strongly felt that people working on the programme (especially Williams, script editor Douglas Adams and star Tom Baker) had stopped taking the show seriously: it was parodying science fiction, rather than presenting serious storylines. He also believed that Williams had allowed Baker too much influence on the show&#x27;s direction, rather than confronting Baker over his increasingly comedic acting style. Nathan-Turner, together with new script editor Christopher H. Bidmead, decided Baker&#x27;s creative influence needed to be reined in.

Nathan-Turner decided on a &quot;new broom&quot; approach, and instituted sweeping changes: replacing the arrangement of the theme music which had run throughout the 1970s with a more contemporary electronic arrangement by Peter Howell, and introducing revamped opening titles (featuring a new photograph of Baker, replacing the original taken in 1974) and a new closing credit sequence. Nathan-Turner also dispensed with the services of long-time composer Dudley Simpson, who had provided the incidental music for the majority of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials of the 1970s and all of the Williams era stories. With Simpson departed, the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; incidental music under Nathan-Turner&#x27;s stewardship would be provided by electronic composers including Peter Howell, Paddy Kingsland, Malcolm Clarke, Roger Limb, Jonathan Gibbs, Keff McCulloch, and Mark Ayres.

As Nathan-Turner had no writing or script-editing experience, the choice of the stories for production was largely left to Bidmead. This at once led to difficulties, with the second story to enter production, &quot;Meglos&quot; (1980), suffering from all the problems which Nathan-Turner had identified in the show&#x27;s scripts under Graham Williams (a lack of realism, an over indulgence in comedy). Nathan-Turner&#x27;s first major story influence was in bringing back the Master, but the details of this he left to Bidmead. At the end of Nathan-Turner&#x27;s first season in charge, both Bidmead and Letts left their posts on the series along with Tom Baker, and Lalla Ward, who had played companion Romana, also left partway through the season in &quot;Warriors&#x27; Gate&quot; (1980). Letts was not replaced, leaving Nathan-Turner as sole producer. Nathan-Turner cast Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor for season 19, having previously worked with him on &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;. Bidmead was briefly replaced with Antony Root, then more permanently with Eric Saward, who would work as script editor (and occasional writer) of the series from 1982 until 1986.

After Nathan-Turner brought the Master back for three consecutive stories, &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot; (1981), &quot;Logopolis&quot; (1981) and &quot;Castrovalva&quot; (1982, now played on a regular basis by Anthony Ainley), he believed that the show could benefit from the publicity inherent in bringing back popular characters and monsters from its past. &quot;Earthshock&quot; (1982) enjoyed considerable publicity from featuring the return of the Cybermen, after an absence of seven years. Season 20 then saw the return of Omega, the Mara, the Black and White Guardians (from the &quot;Key to Time&quot; season), and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. The Daleks and Davros also returned in &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; (1984), but the re-use of classic villains often proved complex for script editor Eric Saward and the show&#x27;s writers. Nathan-Turner, however, was largely focused on generating publicity for the series, something which he also achieved by the device of casting high profile, well-known actors (sometimes from the world of light entertainment) as guest stars.

Nathan-Turner rarely used directors or writers who had worked for previous producers. The few exceptions were director Pennant Roberts (who directed &quot;Warriors of the Deep&quot; and &quot;Timelash&quot;), and the writers David Fisher (who wrote &quot;The Leisure Hive&quot;), Terrance Dicks (who wrote &quot;State of Decay&quot; and &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;), and Robert Holmes (who wrote &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;, &quot;The Mysterious Planet&quot; and the first episode of &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot;).

By coincidence, Nathan-Turner&#x27;s tenure occurred during a period of large growth in the show&#x27;s fan base in the United States, thanks to repeated showings there of the Tom Baker serials on affiliates of the American Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) network. Nathan-Turner became a familiar face among the many &quot;Doctor Who&quot; celebrities who made appearances during PBS fundraising drives, held to finance the purchase of more &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials for screening in the United States.

In addition to his work on the television series, for some years during the Eighties Nathan-Turner&#x27;s interest in light entertainment led to him producing an annual Christmas Pantomime, at the Tunbridge Wells Theatre, starring the incumbent Doctor and other members of the cast. The first of these, in December 1982, starred Peter Davison and co-starred Anthony Ainley (the Master) and the actress Sandra Dickinson (who at that time was Davison&#x27;s wife, but later guest starred in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; with Jon Pertwee, on &quot;Ghosts of N-Space&quot;).

During his time producing &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Nathan-Turner wrote two books about the programme, &quot;Doctor Who: The TARDIS Inside Out&quot; (1985) and &quot;Doctor Who: The Companions&quot; (1986).

===Contentious decisions===

Criticism of his production decisions was wide-ranging, from employing too many back-references (thereby limiting the scriptwriters, and confusing the casual viewer), to employing excessive violence in Colin Baker&#x27;s 1985 season, to his hostility to using writers and directors from the show&#x27;s past, and in the casting of guest stars best known for roles from light entertainment rather than from drama (including Rodney Bewes, Beryl Reid, Richard Briers, Ken Dodd and Hale and Pace). Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; argued that &quot;John Nathan-Turner should be applauded for enticing big-name guest stars and his &#x27;stunt casting&#x27; of actors in wildly inappropriate roles often pays off&quot;, although he cited Briers as an example who was &quot;shockingly bad&quot;.

He was criticised for the casting of companions purely as gimmicks: the character Tegan Jovanka (an Australian air-stewardess played by Janet Fielding) was introduced solely to curry favour with viewers in Australia; whilst Peter Davison reported that the American character Peri Brown (played by Nicola Bryant) was introduced only in an attempt to endear the show to American viewers. Davison has said Nathan-Turner&#x27;s decision to introduce an American companion merely to appeal to the American market was one of his reasons for leaving the show, as he felt it was wrong for the series, but led to his realising that – despite being its star – the direction of the series was out of his control, and he could do nothing about decisions he disagreed with.

In 1985, BBC1 controller Michael Grade enforced an 18-month hiatus on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, publicly criticising the series as tired, violent and unimaginative. In 1986, after the series had returned (with fewer episodes in the season), Grade insisted that Nathan-Turner replace the actor he had cast as the Sixth Doctor, Colin Baker, as a condition of it continuing. According to an interview with Peter Davison in 2018, Baker was &quot;the victim&quot; because &quot;the power structure in the BBC had changed and they didn&#x27;t want John Nathan-Turner around.&quot;

Nathan-Turner also received criticism from his former executive producer, Barry Letts, for introducing the question mark motif on Tom Baker&#x27;s costume. Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy all said they were not happy with their wardrobe in the series. Davison disliked what he considered the &quot;designer look&quot; of his cricket attire; Baker didn&#x27;t approve of the tasteless multi-coloured outfit he was given (as he detailed in the documentaries &quot;The Story of Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Trials and Tribulations&quot;); while McCoy was dissatisfied with his pullover being covered in question marks, which he found &quot;overstated&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Tim Dowling thought it &quot;certainly undermined a lot of his darker scenes&quot;.

Eric Saward, who joined &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as script editor in season 19 (1982), had a tumultuous working relationship with Nathan-Turner and quit the programme during production of season 23 (1986). In September 1986, an interview with Saward was published in issue No. 97 of &quot;Starburst&quot; magazine in which Saward voiced scathing criticism of Nathan-Turner.

Nathan-Turner&#x27;s casting decisions for the central role of the Doctor have also been criticised. Former script editor Terrance Dicks said of the three actors he cast: &quot;The magic wasn&#x27;t quite there.&quot; Former producer Philip Hinchcliffe stated that, following Tom Baker&#x27;s departure, the series &quot;became a bit pantomime for me&quot; and that Baker&#x27;s successors lacked the &quot;moral conviction&quot; the earlier actors brought to the role. Eric Saward disagreed with the casting of Colin Baker in particular, saying he lacked &quot;the energy and eccentricity that the part calls for&quot;, and complained that Nathan-Turner hadn&#x27;t discussed casting decisions with him. Saward was also unhappy with the casting of Bonnie Langford as Mel Bush, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t think she can act, let alone bring anything to the show.&quot;

Terrance Dicks was particularly scathing of Nathan-Turner&#x27;s production of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during an interview in 2013: &quot;There was a decline, without a doubt. I think the people working on it, particularly John Nathan-Turner, were not fit for purpose, as it were. Colin Baker, for example, never got a chance with that silly costume, which I thought was a great shame. I was sorry, but I wasn&#x27;t surprised when they took it off.&quot; Composer and audio engineer Mark Ayres made an impassioned defence of Nathan-Turner on the DVD commentary for &quot;The Greatest Show in the Galaxy&quot;, stating: &quot;John gets a lot of criticism as a producer but he was absolutely fantastic in giving people a chance: new writers, new composers, new actresses. And a lot of what John did didn&#x27;t work, let&#x27;s be honest, but when it does work I think you get something really quite special.&quot;

==Later career==

After the series ended in 1989, and until shortly before his death, Nathan-Turner continued to be involved in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-related events, and remained a familiar face at conventions for many years afterwards.

In the early 1990s, while working for BBC Video, Nathan-Turner produced and wrote several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; videotape documentary releases: &quot;The Hartnell Years&quot;, &quot;The Troughton Years&quot;, &quot;The Pertwee Years&quot;, &quot;The Tom Baker Years&quot;, &quot;The Colin Baker Years&quot;, &quot;Daleks: The Early Years&quot;, &quot;Cybermen: The Early Years&quot;, and a special release of the unfinished story &quot;Shada&quot; with Tom Baker doing first person linking narration as the Fourth Doctor in place of the missing scenes.

Also during the early 1990s, Nathan-Turner produced the earliest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; commercial releases on audio cassette, for the BBC Radio Collection, creating narrated adaptations of television serials for which only the soundtrack remained. In these, he mixed the surviving soundtrack with a narration (written by himself) explaining the missing pictures, using as narrator actors who had played the Doctor. As Patrick Troughton had died in 1987, Nathan-Turner contracted Jon Pertwee (for &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;), Tom Baker (for &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;), and Colin Baker (for &quot;The Macra Terror&quot;) to narrate Troughton-era stories which, at the time of the link narration recordings, were all missing from the BBC&#x27;s television archives except for episode 2 of &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot;. Nathan-Turner left his roles at BBC Video and the BBC Radio Collection at the end of 1992.

Nathan-Turner co-presented the &quot;BSB&quot; &quot;31 Who&quot; programmes during their 1990 &quot;Doctor Who Weekend&quot;, and co-wrote the 1993 charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; for the show&#x27;s 30th Anniversary. Nathan-Turner made his final contribution to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in March 2002, six weeks before his death, when he gave his final interview on a location visit to what was used during the &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; recordings in 1983. This last interview from March 2002 first appeared on the November 2002 original DVD release of &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot;.

==Personal life==

A long term drinker and smoker, Nathan-Turner was in poor health in the last years of his life. He contracted an infection and died in hospital on 1 May 2002, aged 54. Nathan-Turner lived for many years in London, with a home also in Saltdean, Brighton.

An out gay man, he was survived by his long-term partner, Gary Downie, who was also a BBC employee (ultimately becoming a production manager with BBC Television). They met in 1972, and worked together on &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, where Nathan-Turner was Production Unit Manager (Downie was the Assistant Floor Manager at BBC Pebble Mill on series 3), and on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Downie, who was born Roderick Pinkus in South Africa in 1940, died on 19 January 2006. He spoke of his life with Nathan-Turner in an interview with &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;.

Richard Marson&#x27;s book, &quot;JN-T: The Life and Scandalous Times of John Nathan-Turner&quot; (2013), alleges inappropriate sexual behaviour on the part of Nathan-Turner and Downie by stating that the two men were preying on male teenage underage fans during the 1980s, including making unwanted advances to himself. The age of consent for gay men at the time was 21 in the UK, compared to 16 for heterosexual relationships.

<text>Jaruman (or Jarumann; died 669) was the fourth Bishop of Mercia. He fought against apostasy outside his diocese. He served as bishop in the time of King Wulfhere of Mercia, on whose behalf he undertook several missions to Saxon tribes which had returned to paganism. He probably originated in Ireland but was educated at Lindisfarne.

Some Tolkien scholars suggest that Jaruman&#x27;s name was the inspiration for that of Saruman in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

<text>Bass River is an estuary and village in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts, United States. The estuary separates the towns of Yarmouth and Dennis at the central, southern sections of the towns. At its widest and most southerly point, it opens to and meets Nantucket Sound. Its brackish, northwestern end flows into Follins Pond, from there winding further north as a brook, to Mill Pond then an underground stream that nearly bisects Cape Cod.

The mouth of the river is between Smugglers Beach on the Yarmouth side and West Dennis Beach on the Dennis side. West Dennis beach has become a popular site for kite boarding in the past few years. In the same way, Kalmus Beach in Hyannis has become popular for windsurfing. Once inside the river, there is a large land mass covered with sea grass, in the middle of which is a large bay. The island is called &#x27;Marsh Island&#x27; by the locals.

Marsh Island separates Bass River into two parts. The right side of the river, which is referred to as the &#x27;Old Field Channel&#x27;, goes towards West Dennis and the Fingers development. The left side is the main channel of the river, passing Windmill Beach, Bass River Yacht Club, Ship Shops Marina and the prestigious Bass River Marina and Yacht Club. After the marina, the river goes under the Route 28 bridge and winds five more miles deep into the cape. Bass River was once considered a viable location for a canal traversing Cape Cod, and is the largest river the Mid-Cape Highway spans.

Bass River is home to a friendly rivalry between West Dennis Yacht Club and the Bass River Yacht Club. These clubs also compete against Hyannis Yacht Club, Wianno Yacht Club, and others in the Southern Massachusetts Sailing Association team racing circuit. The Yarmouth shores are home to Bass River Golf Course, which is owned and operated by the town of Yarmouth.

<doc id="1229071" wikidata="Q3625450" url="?curid=1229071" title="Syntagmatic analysis">
<text>In semiotics, syntagmatic analysis is analysis of syntax or surface structure (syntagmatic structure) as opposed to paradigms (paradigmatic analysis). This is often achieved using commutation tests.

&quot;Syntagmatic&quot; means that one element selects the other element either to precede it or to follow it. For example, the definitive article &quot;the&quot; selects a noun and not a verb.

Of particular use in semiotic study, a syntagm is a chain which leads, through syntagmatic analysis, to an understanding of how a sequence of events forms a narrative. Alternatively, syntagmatic analysis can describe the spatial relationship of a visual text such as posters, photographs or a particular setting of a filmed scene.

Roland Barthes was able to use metaphor in the form of various garments in order to display how the syntagm/paradigm relationship worked together to at once create and change meaning. Expanding on this form of explanation by Barthes, both David Lodge and Susan Spiggle have further developed the metaphor, using specific wearable items. Shirt, shorts and sandals for example, are freely interchangeable along the plane of tops, bottoms and footwear, the paradigmatic plane, assuming they follow the rules of wearable items, the syntagmatic plane. While you can change the sandals for high heels, it would be breaking the rules to wear them as a top.

==Application==

Due to the abstract nature of the signifier/signified relationship, a free-standing signifier is unable to convey knowledge or understanding by itself. After all, the only reason any word means what it means at all is due to a consensus of understanding by the wider community. Expanding on Saussure&#x27;s own example of the arbitrariness of the word &quot;tree&quot;, or any word for that matter, it can be seen that the word &quot;tree&quot; by itself could mean just about any upright bit of wood with branches, whether it grows leaves or provides a place to hang cups or hats. Meaning is therefore provided by an extended syntagmatic chain, which will identify for the reader of the text just what sort of tree is meant.

This understanding leads to the opportunity to consider the linguistics of texts and language in a wider variety ways. Thwaite, Davis, and Mules identify a syntagm as &quot;the result of using a conventional rule to combine a series of elements from various paradigms&quot;. From this understanding it is possible to consider the structure of textsfilm and television being an ideal example.

Looking at the mise-en-scène of a set piece, the various signs combine to give the viewer a greater understanding of what they are viewing. The syntagmatic chain is constructed in such a way that it sets the feel of the scene and is particularly apparent when considering genre. A western for example may have many of the paradigmatic signs that the viewer has grown accustomed to. That everything is where they expect to see it is following the rules of this syntagmatic chain. If the horse is riding the cowboy, it breaks these rules and becomes a very different movie.

<text>A synsepal is a floral structure formed by the partial or complete fusion of two or more sepals. Such sepals are said to be synsepalous or gamosepalous.

It is common among lady&#x27;s slipper orchids (Cypripedioideae) that the two lateral sepals are connate to form a synsepal in the outer whorl. This is located directly behind the pouch, opposite the upward-pointing dorsal sepal.

Synsepals may be bifid, i.e. divided into two equal lobes, or forked and divided in two by a deep cleft.

<text>Urban Frank Meyer III (born July 10, 1964) is an American sportscaster and former college football coach. He spent most of his coaching career at the collegiate level, having served as the head coach of the Bowling Green Falcons from 2001 to 2002, the Utah Utes from 2003 to 2004, the Florida Gators from 2005 to 2010, and the Ohio State Buckeyes from 2012 to 2018. He retired from coaching in 2019 at the end of the Rose Bowl, and stayed at Ohio State as an assistant athletic director and was also an analyst for Fox Sports, appearing weekly on their &quot;Big Noon Kickoff&quot; pregame show. In 2021, Meyer came out of retirement to take his first National Football League (NFL) job as head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, but was fired 13 games into his first and only season, after going 2–11 and being involved in both on- and off-field controversies. He then went back to Fox Sports to resume his broadcasting career.

Meyer was born in Toledo, Ohio; grew up in Ashtabula, Ohio; and attended the University of Cincinnati, where he played football as a defensive back. While at the University of Florida, he coached the Gators to two BCS National Championship Game victories, during the 2006 and 2008 seasons. Meyer&#x27;s winning percentage through the conclusion of the 2009 season (.842) was the highest among active coaches with a minimum of five full seasons at a Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) program.

Following his temporary retirement in 2011, he worked as a college football analyst for the television sports network ESPN before joining Ohio State to become their head coach. In 2014, he led the Buckeyes to their first Big Ten Conference title under his tenure as well as the program&#x27;s eighth national championship. Meyer is one of four coaches, along with Pop Warner, Howard Jones, and Nick Saban, to win a major college football national championship at two universities. Meyer was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2025.

==Early life==

Meyer was born on July 10, 1964, in Toledo, Ohio, and was raised in Ashtabula, Ohio. He graduated from Ashtabula&#x27;s Saint John High School in 1982.

Meyer was selected in the 13th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball Draft by the Atlanta Braves as a shortstop, where he spent two seasons playing minor league baseball in the Braves organization. He concurrently played defensive back at the University of Cincinnati before earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology in 1986. During his undergraduate studies, Meyer was a member of Sigma Chi Fraternity (Zeta Psi Chapter).

Meyer earned his master&#x27;s degree in sports administration in 1988 from Ohio State University.

==Coaching career==
In 2004, Meyer was recognized as the college football coach of the year by both sportswriters (Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year) and television commentators (Home Depot Coach of the Year Award). He then had twenty years of college coaching experience, including nine as a head coach. His overall record as a head coach through the end of the 2009 season was 96–18, and he was 49–14 in conference play. His winning percentage (.842) through the end of the 2009 season ranked first nationally among active college football head coaches. By winning the 2009 BCS Championship game on January 8, 2009, Meyer moved past Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops into second place on the list of active Division I coaches ranked by winning percentage.

Meyer is Catholic, and on several occasions has referred to the head coaching position at the University of Notre Dame as his &quot;dream job&quot;, leading to speculation that he would someday wish to coach there. However, according to a July 2009 newspaper report, Meyer insisted he would never leave Florida for Notre Dame. And when the employment status of Irish coach Charlie Weis came into question in November 2009, Meyer held a press conference to dispel rumors linking him to the possible opening, stating that he would remain at Florida for &quot;as long as they&#x27;ll have me&quot;. The University of Cincinnati&#x27;s Brian Kelly was eventually hired for the job.

On December 26, 2009, Meyer announced he would resign following the team&#x27;s bowl game against Cincinnati, citing health concerns. However, the following day Meyer announced that he would instead take an indefinite leave of absence, and he resumed his coaching duties in time for the beginning of the Gators&#x27; spring practice on March 17, 2010.

Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley announced Meyer&#x27;s resignation on December 8, 2010, but stated that Meyer would remain as the head coach through the Gators&#x27; appearance in the Outback Bowl on January 1, 2011.

On November 28, 2011, Meyer accepted the head coach position at Ohio State University.

===Early coaching career===
After playing as a defensive back and placeholder for the University of Cincinnati, Meyer spent one season interning as a defensive back coach at Saint Xavier High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1985 under the mentorship of legendary St. Xavier head coach Steve Rasso, where he met members of the Ohio State coaching staff. His first collegiate coaching position was a two-year stint as a graduate assistant coaching tight ends at Ohio State under head coach Earle Bruce. He spent the next thirteen years as an assistant—two at Illinois State, six at Colorado State, and five at Notre Dame.

One of the talents he coached at Colorado State was WR Greg Primus (3,096 yards and 17 TD in 3 years). He put up over 1,000 yards receiving from 1990 to 1992 under Meyer&#x27;s tutelage. At Notre Dame, he coached WR Bobby Brown who would finish his career with 1,521 yards and 12 TD receiving. At Notre Dame in 2000, he coached WR David Givens who would later be drafted by the New England Patriots.

In 1990, while still the linebacker coach at Illinois State, he called Toledo head coach Nick Saban&#x27;s home and spoke to Saban&#x27;s wife to inquire if a position was available. Saban, however, never returned the call. Saban later said &quot;I was so kind of caught up and busy with what I was doing, I never really followed up on that. Obviously, that was a huge mistake on my part because the guy&#x27;s a fantastic coach.&quot;

===Bowling Green===
In 2001, Meyer took his first head coaching job at Bowling Green. In his first season there, he engineered one of the greatest turnarounds in the NCAA football history, going 8–3 and capping off the season with a 56–21 victory over Bowling Green&#x27;s rival, the University of Toledo Rockets. He also earned Mid-American Conference coach of the year honors. The next year, Bowling Green finished with a 9–3 record. After a 17–6 overall record, Meyer left for the University of Utah.

He helped turn around a team that had gone 2–9 in 2000 in large part due to QB Josh Harris, a player tailor-made for Meyer&#x27;s scheme. In a part-time play in 2001, Harris passed for 1,022 yards with 9 touchdowns and ran for 600 yards and 8 touchdowns. The next year, he passed for 2,425 yards with 19 TD and ran for 737 yards with 20 TD. Meyer would later use such quarterbacks as Alex Smith and Tim Tebow in a fashion similar to the way Meyer used Harris.

===Utah===
After two seasons at Bowling Green, he took the job at Utah in 2003. In his first year there, Meyer was named the Mountain West Conference&#x27;s Coach of the Year with a 10–2 record, the best ever for a coach&#x27;s first season at Utah. He also earned honors as &quot;The Sporting News&quot; National Coach of the Year, the first Utes coach to do so. They also won the program&#x27;s first outright conference championship since the 1957 team won the Skyline Conference title.

Meyer&#x27;s success can be attributed to his unique offensive system, which is an offshoot of Bill Walsh&#x27;s West Coast Offense, relying on short pass routes. Meyer&#x27;s base offense spreads three receivers and puts the quarterback in shotgun formation. Then, he introduces motion in the backfield and turns it into an option attack, adding elements of the traditional run-oriented option offense.

In 2004, Meyer led the undefeated Utes to a Bowl Championship Series bid, something that had not been done by a team from a non-automatically qualifying BCS conference since the formation of the BCS in 1998. He remained at Utah long enough to coach the team to a Fiesta Bowl win over Pittsburgh, capping off the Utes&#x27; first perfect season (12–0) since 1930.

In 2003, Utes quarterback Alex Smith threw for 2,247 yards and 15 touchdowns and ran for 452 yards with five touchdowns. In 2004, he threw for 2,952 yards with 32 touchdowns and ran for 631 yards and 10 touchdowns. His production in Meyer&#x27;s offensive scheme was a large reason why Smith was considered a first-round pick entering the 2005 NFL draft.

===Florida===
In the wake of his accomplishments at Utah, both the University of Florida and the University of Notre Dame vied for his services. Meyer chose to become Florida&#x27;s head coach for the 2005 season, signing a seven-year contract worth $14 million. He later signed a six-year contract extension with the Gators on June 7, 2007; the extended contract paid an average of $3.25 million per year. On August 3, 2009, Meyer received another contract extension that made him the SEC&#x27;s highest-paid coach during the 2009 season; his 2009 extension was worth $24 million over six years. At the time of the latest contract extension, Meyer was the third highest-paid college football coach, behind only Pete Carroll and Charlie Weis.

Meyer has been criticized by some commentators because 31 of his players were arrested during his six years as the Gators&#x27; coach. The seriousness of the charges varied widely, from minor offenses such as possession of alcohol by a minor to the charges of possession of a concealed weapon, &quot;aggravated stalking, domestic violence by strangulation, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and fraudulent use of credit cards&quot;. Many of the charges were ultimately dismissed.

In September 2010, after Gator receiver Chris Rainey was arrested for sending a threatening text message to a former girlfriend, Meyer stated that he was &quot;real upset about that. After a while, enough&#x27;s enough. If there&#x27;s something that we can improve on, we&#x27;re certainly looking into that. It&#x27;s like if our graduation rate stinks then we gotta improve that. If there are other issues in a program, that&#x27;s our job to get it better. It&#x27;s people making stupid mistakes, that&#x27;s something we gotta correct.&quot;

====2005 season====

In 2005, his first season at Florida, Meyer&#x27;s Gators team finished the season 9–3 (5–3 in the Southeastern Conference). The season included an undefeated record at home and a bowl victory against Iowa in the Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida. The Gators would have faced LSU in the , but they lost to South Carolina and former Florida head coach Steve Spurrier in the SEC regular-season finale.
====2006 season====

In 2006, Meyer coached the Gators to a 13–1 (8–1 in the SEC) record, with the one loss coming to the Auburn Tigers. After clinching the SEC East, the Gators won the on December 2 over Arkansas by a score of 38–28. The Gators defeated the Ohio State Buckeyes, 41–14, in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game to win the national championship. It was the first BCS bowl berth for the Gators since the Orange Bowl that capped off the 2001 campaign, and Florida&#x27;s first national championship appearance and victory since winning the 1997 Sugar Bowl.

Meyer has been known for winning big games. In addition to his 5–1 record in bowl games at Florida, Meyer compiled a 16–2 record against three of the Gators&#x27; biggest opponents—Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida State.

====2007 season====

The Gators managed a 9–3 regular season record in 2007, including blowout wins over rivals Tennessee and FSU but once again losing to Auburn. During his tenure at the University of Florida, Coach Meyer never defeated Auburn. Quarterback Tim Tebow also became Coach Meyer&#x27;s first Heisman Trophy winner. The team led the conference in scoring, but struggles on defense made it difficult for the Gators to reach a BCS bowl game. The Gators lost the to Michigan 41–35 on January 1, 2008. Meyer served as a pre-game and halftime analyst for the 2008 BCS National Championship Game.

====2008 season====
In 2008, Meyer led the Gators to a 13–1 overall record and the BCS National Championship over Oklahoma, including wins over six ranked teams. The team&#x27;s lone defeat came at the hands of Ole Miss on September 27, 2008, a game in which Florida led in time of possession and passing yards, but had three turnovers. Eleven of the Gators&#x27; twelve wins in the 2008 regular season were by 20 points or more. On December 6, 2008, Meyer led the Gators to a 31–20 victory over then top-ranked Alabama in the SEC title game. Leading in time of possession, rushing yards, and passing yards, the Gators rallied from behind after a third-quarter deficit to score two touchdowns and hold Alabama scoreless in the fourth quarter. The victory would vault Florida to No. 1 in the Associated Press Poll, No. 2 in the USA Today Coaches&#x27; Poll, and No. 2 in the BCS rankings, setting up a showdown against Oklahoma in the BCS Championship Game on January 8, 2009, at Dolphin Stadium in Miami, Florida. The Gators won 24–14, securing their second national championship under Meyer.

====2009 season====

In 2009, Meyer&#x27;s Gators began the season ranked No. 1 by the largest margin in the history of the AP preseason poll. Though the team struggled on offense at times, and quarterback Tim Tebow suffered a frightening concussion in a September victory over Kentucky, Florida finished the regular season 12–0 and still ranked No. 1. The winning streak ended in the SEC Championship Game, when they lost 32–13 to Alabama.

Florida was selected to play the undefeated Cincinnati Bearcats in the 2010 Sugar Bowl. The Gators won 51–24 to finish the season with a 13–1 record for the second consecutive year.

====Leave of absence====
In the early morning of December 6, 2009, soon after returning home following his team&#x27;s loss in the 2009 SEC Championship Game, Meyer was quietly admitted into a Gainesville hospital suffering from chest pains and dehydration. He was released later in the day, and the incident was not announced to the public at the time.

On December 26, after discussions with his family, Meyer revealed his medical scare and announced that he would resign as Florida&#x27;s head coach due to health and family concerns following his team&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day Sugar Bowl appearance. Meyer stated: &quot;I have ignored my health for years, but recent developments have forced me to re-evaluate my priorities of faith and family.&quot; He also said: &quot;I&#x27;m proud to be a part of the Gainesville community and the Gator Nation and I plan to remain in Gainesville and involved with the University of Florida.&quot; Meyer admitted that he had suffered frequent chest pains, later discovered to be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and occasional severe headaches due to an arachnoid cyst for years, and that they were related to stress.

On December 27, Meyer announced that he would take an indefinite leave of absence instead of resigning. He was unsure if he would return for the 2010 season but stated that &quot;I do in my gut believe that will happen.&quot; Offensive coordinator Steve Addazio would serve as the interim coach in Meyer&#x27;s absence.

On January 1, 2010, Meyer coached the Gators in their 51–24 Sugar Bowl victory over the Cincinnati Bearcats. In a post-game interview, Meyer again suggested that he would return to coach the Gators at some point by saying: &quot;I plan on being the coach of the Gators.&quot;

Meyer took significant time off from his coaching duties after the bowl game in an attempt to improve his personal health. While he did stay in touch with potential new players during the busy recruiting season, Meyer did much less traveling to visit recruits than usual. Nevertheless, the Gators still signed the consensus No. 1 recruiting class in the nation in February.

On March 17, 2010, Meyer returned full-time to his position for the start of the Gators&#x27; spring practice and continued in that role into the 2010 season.

====2010 season====

With his victory over Kentucky on September 25, 2010, Meyer achieved his 100th career win as a coach. With that win, his record was at 100–18 over the course of 10 seasons. He became the sixth fastest NCAA coach to reach that record, following Gil Dobie (108 games), George Woodruff (109 games), Bud Wilkinson (111 games), Fielding Yost (114 games), and Knute Rockne (117 games). He was also the second-fastest to reach 100 wins since Wilkinson in 1945.

Despite reaching this milestone, the season was a difficult one for the Gators, and their 7–5 regular-season record was the worst in Meyer&#x27;s tenure at Florida. On December 8, 2010, Meyer again announced his retirement from coaching for much the same reasons he mentioned in December 2009: his family and his health.

Meyer&#x27;s last game as Florida&#x27;s coach was a 37–24 win in the 2011 Outback Bowl on January 1, 2011.

====Aftermath====
After a three-month investigation, the &quot;Sporting News&quot; published an exposé titled &quot;How Urban Meyer broke Florida football&quot;, suggesting that Meyer had created a toxic culture in the locker room at Florida and departed just before implosion. The article quoted several Florida players who declared that Meyer developed a &quot;Circle of Trust&quot; that included only star players, and that those players received favorable treatment, including not having to complete workouts, lenient punishment, and hiding the player&#x27;s positive drug tests from the public. Although Meyer stated: &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard of Circle of Trust before in my life&quot;, former players contend it was the foundation of Florida&#x27;s culture under Meyer.

===ESPN career===
After resigning as the head football coach of the Florida Gators, Meyer worked as a college football commentator and analyst for the American television sports network ESPN.

===Ohio State===
On November 17, 2011, &quot;Eleven Warriors&quot; reported that Meyer would become the head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes. Meyer denied the report publicly, then asked ESPN to be taken off assignment during the weekend of the Ohio State–Michigan game, adding more to the speculations that he might be named the next head coach of Ohio State. On November 28, WBNS Columbus confirmed that Meyer had accepted the job as Ohio State&#x27;s head football coach, and was introduced as head coach later that night. The school said Meyer would receive a six-year contract that paid $4 million annually, plus another $2.4 million total in &quot;retention payments&quot;. It was reported by CBS Sports on April 13, 2015, that Meyer signed a contract extension with the Buckeyes through 2020.

====2012 season====

In Meyer&#x27;s first year of coaching at Ohio State, he helped lead the Buckeyes to an undefeated 12–0 record and a No. 3 AP Poll ranking. The team was ineligible for all other rankings, as well as postseason play, due to NCAA sanctions. He was surrounded by first-year coaches such as offensive coordinator Tom Herman, co-offensive coordinator Ed Warriner, and co-defensive coordinator Everett Withers.
====2013 season====

Meyer&#x27;s next year was not as good as the previous one, but Ohio State still finished #12 in the BCS rankings and a 12–2 record. Meyer lost talent at the end of the year to the 2014 NFL Draft, including linebacker Ryan Shazier, cornerback Bradley Roby, and running back Carlos Hyde. Roby and Shazier went in the first round, and Hyde went in the second round.

====2014 season====
Before the start of the season, Ohio State lost its star quarterback, Braxton Miller, when he sustained a right shoulder injury during practice. Redshirt freshman quarterback J. T. Barrett stepped in as his replacement and led Ohio State to an 11–1 record through the first 12 games of the season. However, in the final game of the regular season, he sustained a broken ankle and was lost for the remainder of the year. Cardale Jones replaced Barrett at quarterback and guided Ohio State to a 59–0 blowout win over Wisconsin in the Big Ten Football Championship Game. With the conference championship and the convincing win over Wisconsin, Ohio State moved up to #4 in the College Football Playoff rankings, jumping the two Big 12 teams in playoff contention, Baylor and TCU, qualifying for the inaugural four-team postseason tournament. They played #1 Alabama in the semifinal Sugar Bowl. Despite being nine-point underdogs and trailing by as much as 15 points in the first half, Ohio State came back to win, 42–35. The Buckeyes then faced Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota and the Oregon Ducks in the College Football Playoff National Championship. The Buckeyes were again underdogs as the #2-ranked Ducks were favored by seven points. Despite giving up four turnovers, Ohio State beat Oregon, 42–20, with MVP performances from running back Ezekiel Elliott and safety Tyvis Powell. The victory marked the eighth national championship in Ohio State&#x27;s history and gave Meyer his third career national title, following his two with Florida.

====2018 season====
On August 1, 2018, Meyer was placed on paid administrative leave by Ohio State after reports surfaced that Meyer knew about spousal abuse allegations against assistant coach Zach Smith prior to Smith&#x27;s firing the week prior.

After an independent investigative panel reviewed the evidence, the Ohio State Board of Trustees found that Meyer and Ohio State University Athletic Director Gene Smith did not uphold the values of the university. On August 22, the board voted to suspend Meyer for the opening three games of the season for the Buckeyes. He missed the team&#x27;s games against Oregon State, Rutgers, and TCU.

Ohio State finished the year with a 12–1 record, including winning the Big Ten conference, but was not selected for the College Football Playoff, instead receiving a spot in the 2019 Rose Bowl.

On December 4, 2018, Meyer announced that he would retire from coaching following the team&#x27;s Rose Bowl game for health reasons. It was announced that Ryan Day would take over the head coaching position immediately after the Rose Bowl.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
On January 14, 2021, Meyer was hired to become the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars. On July 1, 2021, the NFL fined Meyer $100,000 for violating practice rules during organized team activities.

In early October, a video appeared to show Meyer inappropriately touching a woman who was not his wife while he was at his Columbus-area restaurant, Urban Meyer&#x27;s Pint House. Meyer apologized to the team and personnel. Jaguars owner Shahid Khan said that Meyer&#x27;s behavior had been &quot;inexcusable&quot; and that Meyer &quot;must regain our trust and respect&quot;.

The Jaguars won their first regular season game on October 17 against the Miami Dolphins by a score of 23–20. The Jaguars won their second regular season game when they defeated the heavily favored Buffalo Bills by a score of 9–6 on November 7.

Toward the end of the 2021 season, Jaguars players and coaches were critical of Meyer&#x27;s treatment of them, to which the team officially responded with assertions of Meyer&#x27;s job security.

On December 15, former Jaguars kicker Josh Lambo publicly accused Meyer of physical abuse, saying that Meyer repeatedly kicked Lambo&#x27;s leg during warmups prior to the team&#x27;s final preseason game. Lambo said it was inexcusable for any boss at any workplace to strike an employee. After Lambo told Meyer never to kick him again, Lambo said Meyer responded, &quot;I&#x27;m the head ball coach. I&#x27;ll kick you whenever the fuck I want.&quot; Later that day, Lambo reported the incident to his agent, who then reported it to the Jaguars team. Within hours of these new revelations from Lambo, Jaguars owner Shahid Khan made the decision to fire Meyer from his position and informed him of this in the early hours of December 16, 2021.

Meyer recorded a 2–11 (.154) record during his brief tenure. His thirteen-game tenure is tied with Lou Holtz and Bobby Petrino for fourth-shortest coaching tenures in NFL history. Holtz and Petrino also were making their NFL head coaching debuts after previously being a head coach in college. His .154 winning percentage is the worst of any non-interim head coach since Cam Cameron&#x27;s .063 winning percentage with the Miami Dolphins in 2007.

On January 26, 2022, Meyer spoke publicly for the first time about his tenure with the Jaguars on Dan Dakich&#x27;s podcast &quot;Don&#x27;t @ Me&quot;, calling it &quot;the worst experience I&#x27;ve had in my professional lifetime&quot;, citing the five-game losing streak and the differences in practice time compared to college football. Meyer added that he experienced &quot;depression&quot;, and said, &quot;I&#x27;d stare at the ceilings and [think] &#x27;are we doing everything possible&#x27; because I really believed we had a roster that was good enough to win games. I just don&#x27;t think we did a great job.&quot;

==Spread offense==
When Meyer landed his first head coaching position at Bowling Green University, he travels to visit John L. Smith and Scott Linehan at University of Louisville, Randy Walker and Kevin Wilson at Northwestern University, Bill Snyder at Kansas State a University, Joe Tiller and Jim Chaney at Purdue University, and Rich Rodriguez at West Virginia University, all of whom ran some version of the spread offense.

Meyer&#x27;s teams at Bowling Green, Utah, Florida, and Ohio State all ran the spread, chiefly utilizing a run-first variation most similar to Rodriguez&#x27;s at West Virginia, but with tweaks to fit the offensive personnel. For example, Meyer&#x27;s first two years at Florida skewed toward a drop-back passing attack led by Chris Leak, while Tim Tebow led an option run-based spread (as did Alex Smith at Utah). Using this offense, he won two BCS titles, won the inaugural College Football Playoff National Championship, became the first coach to lead a BCS non-automatically qualified conference team (Utah) to a BCS bowl, coached a Heisman Trophy winner (Tim Tebow), and graduated a player who became a number one overall pick in the NFL draft (Alex Smith).

<doc id="1229078" wikidata="Q5130472" url="?curid=1229078" title="Publicly funded elections">
<text>A publicly funded election is an election funded with money collected through income tax donations or taxes as opposed to private or corporate funded campaigns. It is a policy initially instituted after Nixon for candidates to opt into publicly funded presidential campaigns via optional donations from tax returns. It is an attempt to move toward a one voice, one vote democracy, and remove undue corporate and private entity dominance.

Jurisdictions such as United Kingdom, Norway, India, Russia, Brazil, Nigeria, and Sweden have considered legislation that would create publicly funded elections.

== United States ==
Methods of publicly funded election legislation have been adopted in Colorado, Maine, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan, Arizona, North Carolina, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Massachusetts.

=== Court rulings and legality ===
Portions of Vermont system for publicly funding elections were found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 2006 decision &quot;Randall v. Sorrell&quot;. In particular, state supplemental funds for publicly financed candidates whose opponents outspend them were struck down, while full funding of governor and lieutenant governor candidates remained in place.

Portions of Connecticut&#x27;s statute were held unconstitutional in 2009, on the grounds that it unfairly discriminated against third party and independent candidates, but the core program of full funding of constitutional and legislative candidates remained in place. In July 2010 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld portions of the district court&#x27;s order but allowed the core program to continue.

In as part of the 2010 &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot; decision, U.S. Supreme Court defined money as a form of speech. A number of jurisdictions reacted by modifying existing laws or trying to pass new laws.

On June 27, 2011, ruling in the consolidated cases &quot;Arizona Free Enterprise Club&#x27;s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett&quot; and &quot;McComish v. Bennett&quot;, the Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional the matching-funds provision of the Arizona law.

=== States ===
Comprehensive public funding systems have been in effect in Arizona and Maine since 2000. In Maine, since enactment, approximately three quarters of state legislators have run their campaigns with government funds provided by the state program. In Arizona, a majority of the state house and both the Republican and Democratic candidates for governor ran publicly financed campaigns in 2006. There has not yet been a statewide election in Maine in which both the Republican and Democratic candidates were financed through the public financing system.

Massachusetts voters passed a Clean Elections Law by referendum in 1998, providing funding to candidates agreeing to limits and a maximum of $100 contributions. The people reversed this position a few years later, voting 74% against keeping publicly funded elections on 2002 Question 3, an advisory question. The law was repealed by the legislature as part of the 2003 state budget. The legislature had refused to fund the law, which prompted state courts to order the sale of a disused state hospital, state-owned automobiles, and desks and sofas in the offices of legislative leaders Thomas M. Finneran, Salvatore F. DiMasi, and Joseph F. Wagner.

In 2008, the California Fair Elections Act (AB583) passed the California Assembly and Senate and was signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Because of the ban on publicly funded elections, the law had to be approved by voters in an initiative in June 2010. On June 8, 2010, California voters decided against the measure by 57% to 43%. An earlier Clean Elections ballot initiative that suggested funding elections with a business tax, Proposition 89 was also defeated in California in 2006, by 74% against to 26% in favor of a corporate tax to fund elections.

A Clean Elections ballot initiative in Alaska failed by a 64% to 35% margin in August 2008.

In 2013, North Carolina repealed its popular &quot;Voter Owned Elections&quot; program of public financing of judicial campaigns.

Wisconsin&#x27;s 33 year old program was ended by the state legislature in 2011 by Governor Scott Walker and the legislature&#x27;s joint finance committee.

In 2016, California overturned its ban on publicly funded elections, but charter cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles were already exempt from the ban and already have some form of public financing.

=== Municipalities ===
Portland, Oregon&#x27;s program was narrowly repealed by voters in a 2010 referendum.

Seattle voters approved the democracy voucher program in 2015, which gives city residents four $25 vouchers to donate to participating candidates. Since then, activists have pushed for democracy vouchers in other jurisdictions, arguing that the program would make political donors more reflective of the population, empower candidates to fundraise without relying on big donors, and decrease the influence of special interest groups over government.

Denver votes passed the Fair Elections Act in 2018. The law went into effect on January 1, 2020. The Fair Elections Act, which began as The Democracy For The People Initiative, has a public funding component that provides a 9-to-1 match on contributions up to $50 for candidates who opt-in and don&#x27;t take any money other than contributions from individuals. It also included a ban on donations from business and unions, and lowered the amounts individuals could donate to candidates.

=== Federal legislation ===
In the US, SB 752, the Fair Elections Now Act, calling for publicly funded elections in U.S. Senate campaigns, was sponsored in the 111th Congress (2009–10) by Senators: Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Arlen Specter (D-PA). A companion bill, H.R. 1826, was introduced in the House, sponsored by John Larson (D-CT), Chellie Pingree (D-ME), and Walter Jones (R-NC). Unlike the Clean Elections laws in Maine and Arizona, H.R. 1826 did not include the &quot;rescue funds&quot; provision, perhaps due to concern about constitutionality in the wake of the Davis decision. Neither bill moved out of committee.

=== Clean elections systems ===
&quot;Clean elections&quot; is the name supporters have given to some public financing efforts, used most prominently in Maine and Arizona.

Some clean elections laws provide a government grant to candidates who agree to limit their spending and private fundraising. Candidates participating in a clean elections system are required to meet certain qualification criteria, which usually includes collecting a number of signatures and small contributions (generally determined by statute and set at $5 in both Maine and Arizona) before the candidate can receive public support. In most clean elections programs, these qualifying contributions must be given by constituents. To receive the government campaign grant, &quot;Clean Candidates&quot; must agree to forgo all other fundraising and accept no other private or personal funds. Candidates who choose not to participate are subject to limits on their fundraising, typically in the form of limits on the size of contributions they may accept and the sources of those contributions (such as limits on corporate or union contributions), and detailed reporting requirements.

In the US, in order to comply with &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot;, participation by candidates is not legally required. Originally, many clean elections programs provided that publicly financed candidates who were outspent by a privately funded candidate could receive additional funds (sometimes called &quot;rescue funds&quot;) to match their privately funded opponent, up to a cap, with the intent of assuring that a candidate running with private funding would not outspend his government funded opponent. However, in &quot;Arizona Free Enterprise Club&#x27;s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court held that such &quot;rescue fund&quot; provisions unconstitutionally burdened the rights of speakers by intentionally limiting the effectiveness of their own speech. Thus since Bennett clean elections systems in the U.S. have been forced to abandon the &quot;rescue funds&quot; approach.

Clean election systems have been endorsed by individuals including U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), political candidate Andrew Yang, founder of the National Voting Rights Institute John Bonifaz, then-Illinois senator Barack Obama, and former-U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ).

== Brazil ==
In 2015, the Supreme Federal Court declared corporate donations to political parties and campaigns to be unconstitutional. Before the decision, electoral laws allowed companies to donate up to 2% of their previous year&#x27;s gross revenue to candidates or party campaign funds, which totaled over 76% ($760m) of the donations on the 2014 election. The decision came as a response to corruption scandals and illegal donations, in the wake of the Operation Car Wash.

Since then, to cover the lack of private campaign finance, a public electoral fund was set up, to be divided among the parties based on their representation in the National Congress. Individuals can still make donations as a natural person, limited to 10% of their income in the previous year.

<text>Sun Yaoting (Traditional Chinese: 孫耀庭, Simplified Chinese: 孙耀庭, Hanyu Pinyin: Sūn Yàotíng, Wade-Giles: Sun Yao-t&#x27;ing; 29 September 1902 – 17 December 1996) was the last surviving imperial eunuch of Chinese history. 

== Life ==
Born into poverty, his family home was burned and fields stolen by a landlord in their village; his family hoped that by making Sun Yaoting into a eunuch, they would gain Imperial influence, and would be able to take revenge on the landlord. At the age of eight, Sun Yaoting was emasculated by his father at home with a single razor cut, and without the use of anesthesia. The emperor he had hoped to serve, Puyi, was deposed months later.

Nonetheless, Sun Yaoting became a palace eunuch, and had become the attendant to the empress before the imperial family was expelled from the Forbidden City. He continued to serve in Manchukuo until the puppet state&#x27;s collapse at the end of World War II. His preserved genitals, considered a treasure by eunuchs, were discarded by his family during the Cultural Revolution, when it was considered taboo to own anything from the &quot;old society.&quot;

The 1988 dramatic film &quot;Lai Shi, China&#x27;s Last Eunuch&quot; is based on Sun Yaoting&#x27;s life. His biography &quot;The Last Eunuch of China&quot; was published in 1998 and translated to English in 2008.

<doc id="1229102" wikidata="Q734900" url="?curid=1229102" title="Heartland Flyer">
<text>The Heartland Flyer is a daily passenger train that follows a route between Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Fort Worth, Texas. It is operated by Amtrak and jointly funded by the states of Oklahoma and Texas.

The train&#x27;s daily round-trip begins in Oklahoma City in the morning and reaches Fort Worth in the early afternoon. It leaves Fort Worth during the afternoon rush for an evening return to Oklahoma City. Future plans call for the train&#x27;s northern terminus to be extended from Oklahoma City to Newton, Kansas with increased frequency along the original route by 2029.

==History==
=== Predecessors ===
The rail corridor utilized by the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; was built in 1887 by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (shortened to the &quot;Santa Fe&quot;) to join its Texas-based Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe subsidiary to the main Santa Fe network. The railroad consisted of two segments: one built south from Arkansas City, Kansas, and one built north from Fort Worth, Texas; the two segments met in modern-day Purcell, Oklahoma. The Land Rush of 1889 followed shortly after, causing many of the railroad stations in Oklahoma to become the centerpieces of permanent settlements; Oklahoma City is a notable example.

The corridor saw use by the Santa Fe for both freight (particularly the movement of cattle) and for passenger rail. Of the passenger routes that used the corridor, the most notable was the &quot;Texas Chief&quot;, which traveled from Chicago to Galveston.

In 1971, following the Rail Passenger Service Act, the &quot;Texas Chief&quot; was transferred to the newly-formed Amtrak. The route (renamed to the &quot;Lone Star&quot; in 1974) remained in service until 1979, when budget cuts at Amtrak caused the route to close. The closure of the &quot;Lone Star&quot; ended passenger rail service in the state of Oklahoma.

=== Inauguration ===
In late 1998, Oklahoma and Kansas state officials began meeting in an effort to restore passenger service along the corridor. Initial plans called for a train from Fort Worth to Kansas City, though this was eventually pared down to the current route for budgetary reasons. On May 18, 1999, Amtrak began taking reservations for the route, tentatively named &quot;The New Train&quot;.

Senator Don Nickles sponsored a &quot;Name the Train&quot; contest, encouraging Oklahoma schoolchildren to pick a name for the new route. The winning name was submitted by 11-year-old Katie Moore of Del City, Oklahoma, who christened the new train on its first run.

The &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; was inaugurated on June 14, 1999, with a demonstration trip from Fort Worth to Oklahoma City, which carried state officials, Amtrak board members, and mayors for the serviced cities. Regular service began the next day, ending a 20-year absence of passenger rail in Oklahoma and North Texas. First-year ticket sales totaled 71,400 passengers, more than triple Amtrak&#x27;s projection of 20,000 riders.

=== Regular service ===
The route carried its 500,000th passenger in September 2007 and its millionth in November 2013.

The state of Oklahoma initially received $23 million in federal funding for the route, which expired in September 2005. In anticipation of this, on April 11, 2005, a rally was held at the Oklahoma State Capitol to demand that the state fund the train, as well as expand the service to Kansas. Oklahoma City mayor Mick Cornett served as a keynote speaker at the event alongside the mayors of Perry, Guthrie, and Purcell. In response, state lawmakers passed House Bill 1078, which provided an annual $2 million subsidy to continue the service; however, the route was not extended.

In April 2016, Amtrak began Thruway bus service between the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; in Oklahoma City and the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; in Newton, Kansas, with one stop in Wichita. The schedule runs mostly overnight because the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; running both eastbound and westbound calls on Newton in the early morning hours. Initial service was operated under contract by Village Tours of Wichita.

On October 15, 2021, the northbound &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; struck a car hauler north of Thackerville, Oklahoma. The train partially derailed and four passengers were injured.

==Proposed expansion==
===Extension to Kansas===
Since its inception, numerous proposals have been made to extend the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; northward from Oklahoma City to Kansas along the original route of the &quot;Lone Star&quot;. The extended line would serve Wichita Union Station before connecting with the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; in Newton, Kansas. Some proposals would further extend the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; from Newton to along the route of the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;.

A 2009 study conducted by Amtrak proposed four options for the extension:

# Extend the current round trip to Newton as a night train
# Extend the current round trip to Kansas City as a night train
# Add a new day train from Fort Worth to Kansas City
# Add a new day train from Oklahoma City to Kansas City

Through coach service with the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; was also stated as a possibility. By September 2010, only the first and third options were said to remain under consideration. In late 2011, the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) released the results of a study into these options. A night train to Newton had an estimated start-up cost of $87.5 million and an annual subsidy of $4.4 million, while a day train to Kansas City had an estimated start-up cost of $245.5 million and an annual subsidy of $10 million. On June 9, 2017, Amtrak ran an inspection train between Oklahoma City and Kansas City in order to explore the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; extension to Newton.

In June 2021, Amtrak included the extension to Newton in its 15-year expansion vision. The plan also includes two additional round trips between Oklahoma City and Fort Worth. In November 2021, President Biden signed the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which could fund the plan. The extension was endorsed by the Oklahoma City Council in April 2022, and by Dodge City in October 2022. The governors of Oklahoma and Kansas supported the use of state funding for the plan.

In June 2023, Oklahoma and Kansas state officials began seeking federal approval and funding to extend the Heartland Flyer from Oklahoma City to Newton. In November 2023, KDOT said the service would start in 2029 if approved, but could begin sooner were the project to be fast tracked.

In December 2023, the Federal Railroad Administration accepted an application by KDOT to enter the Oklahoma City–Wichita–Newton extension into its Corridor Identification and Development Program. The program grants $500,000 toward service planning and prioritizes the extension for future federal funding. It could include stops in Edmond, Guthrie, Perry, and Ponca City.

===Other proposals===
During the 1990s, a reroute of the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; was considered that would have removed Austin and San Antonio in favor of the former Texas &amp; Pacific route via Abilene and Midland/Odessa to Sierra Blanca. To compensate for the loss, the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; would have been extended south to San Antonio, connecting with the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;. This reroute was ultimately rejected.

In 2020, Amtrak reported it was working to add a new stop in Thackerville, Oklahoma with access to the WinStar World Casino operated by the Chickasaw Nation.

==Rolling stock==

The &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; uses equipment from Amtrak&#x27;s national fleet, typically two General Electric Genesis locomotives and two or three &quot;Superliner&quot; railcars. One of the &quot;Superliner&quot; cars is a snack coach with seating on the upper level of the car and a small Café area on the lower level. Previously, the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; used a combination of &quot;Hi-Level&quot; and &quot;Superliner&quot; railcars.

For many years, the train was powered by only one locomotive with a Non-Powered Control Unit (NPCU) on the opposite end of the train to facilitate bi-directional travel. In 2009, the NPCU was replaced with a standard Genesis P42DC, giving the train locomotive power on both ends. The train returned to having an NPCU in 2015 until an accident in 2017 took one NPCU out of operation so the train alternated between both configurations. It later returned to having locomotive power on both ends.

From April 2010 to April 2011, Amtrak and the Oklahoma Department of Transportation carried out a research project to run the train on a biodiesel blend known as B20 (20% pure biofuel and 80% diesel).

In 2022, Amtrak announced plans to replace its aging fleet of locomotives and railcars over the next ten years. Under the plan, the rolling stock utilized by the &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot; will be replaced between 2027 and 2032, though the exact trainset has not yet been determined.

=== Big Game Train ===
From the route&#x27;s inception in 1999, additional cars have been added during the week of the Red River Rivalry football game to accommodate fan travel to and from Dallas, where the game is held. Dubbed the &quot;Big Game Train&quot;, this layout originally consisted of one additional coach, but has since been increased to as many as three coaches plus a &quot;Sightseer&quot; lounge. This configuration has been used every year, with the exception of 2020, when the train was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="1229108" wikidata="Q1121617" url="?curid=1229108" title="Leroy F. Aarons">
<text>Leroy &quot;Roy&quot; F. Aarons (December 8, 1933 – November 28, 2004) was an American journalist, editor, author, playwright, founder of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA), and founding member of the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education. In 2005 he was inducted into the NLGJA Hall of Fame.

==Early life==

He was born in Bronx, New York, on December 8, 1933 to Latvian-Jewish immigrant parents. Leroy F. Aarons Aarons graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Brown University and earned an MS from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He served in the Navy and Naval Reserve, attained the rank of lieutenant, and was a copyeditor at the &quot;New Haven Journal-Courier.&quot;

==At &quot;The Washington Post&quot;==

Aarons worked at the &quot;Post&quot; for many years. As an editor and a national correspondent, he served as New York bureau chief and later established the paper&#x27;s first Los Angeles bureau. He covered major events of the 1960s and 1970s such as the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, urban riots, and government scandals.

Aarons had a front-row seat when the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; story surfaced. As Los Angeles bureau chief, he covered California-related events in the case, including what work Daniel Ellsberg had been doing for the Rand Corporation and how he managed to remove the Pentagon Papers from Rand headquarters.

The scandal that forced a president to resign was Watergate, and the &quot;Post&quot; was the paper that broke the story. Because of his role at the paper during the Watergate reporting, Aarons was hired as an accuracy consultant for the &quot;Post&quot;-centered film about the scandal, &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;.

==Work with Robert C. Maynard==

In 1981 Aarons met Israeli computer consultant Joshua Boneh at his Jewish Community Center in Washington D.C. He followed Boneh to Israel in 1982 where he covered the Lebanon War for &quot;Time&quot;. The two celebrated their 20th anniversary with a commitment ceremony at the same JCC where they met. Aarons joined the &quot;Oakland Tribune,&quot; urged by former colleague Robert C. Maynard. Maynard had purchased the declining &quot;Tribune&quot; and recruited Roy to be its features editor.

In the 1970s Aarons had joined Maynard in founding what would become the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education (MIJE). Maynard had been working with a summer program for minority journalists at Columbia University, and he urged Aarons to join its faculty. In 1976, the program moved to the University of California, Berkeley as the Summer Program for Minority Journalists. It later became MIJE, a model program in training and supporting minority journalists.

At the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Aarons rose to executive editor and then to senior vice president for news, where he worked for greater staff diversity. He led his team to a 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The following year he retired from journalism.

==Activism==

In 1989 the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE) asked Aarons to coordinate a survey of gay and lesbian journalists. Responses from 250 print journalists revealed that most were closeted in their newsrooms. An overwhelming majority said coverage of gay issues was &quot;at best mediocre.&quot; Fewer than 60 percent had told colleagues about their sexual orientation; fewer than 7 percent said their work environments were good for gays. At ASNE&#x27;s national convention in 1990, Aarons presented the results and closed his speech by coming out. Four months after his speech, Aarons convened six journalists in his California dining room to launch the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA). He was its president until 1997, and remained on the board until his death.

After working for over a year, in Fall 2003, Aarons, Dane S. Claussen, Amy Falkner, Rhonda Gibson, and others relaunched the then-GLBT Interest Group of the Association for Education in Journalism &amp; Mass Communication (AEJMC). Aarons asked Claussen to serve as the first Head, but he could not because he already was to be 2003-4 Head of AEJMC&#x27;s Mass Communication &amp; Society Division. David Adams and Sue Lafky served as the first Co-Heads, with Claussen as Vice-Head/Program Chair, and Aarons as Secretary. Aarons, then teaching at the University of Southern California, followed that up by persuading the Accrediting Council for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (ACEJMC) to add sexual orientation content in its curriculum diversity standard.

On its 15th anniversary in 2006, NLGJA established the annual Leroy F. Aarons Scholarship Award for a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender student pursuing a journalism career. CNN provided $100,000 to fund the scholarship. The AEJMC LGBTQ Interest Group&#x27;s Teaching Committee also awards, generally every two years, its Leroy F. Aarons Award for lifetime contributions to university teaching and/or research related to the LGBTQ communities.

==Influence in journalism==

In the 1970s, Aarons collaborated with Robert Maynard in starting programs to train people of color for journalism careers, then switching to LGBT issues in journalism.

Aarons believed that coverage of the gay community, as with other minorities, required training of journalists. He began to lobby journalism schools to include gay issues in their diversity training. In 1999, as a visiting professor of journalism at the USC Annenberg School for Communication, he founded and directed its Sexual Orientation Issues in the News program. Adapted by universities, the program analyzes how the media has shaped public perception of people and issues since the early 20th century. In 2003, Aarons, Dane S. Claussen, David L. Adams, and several other U.S. journalism professors relaunched the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Interest Group of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. The group biannually presents the Leroy F. Aarons Award for career contributions to media-oriented education and research affecting LGBTQ.

In 1985, Aarons started We the People - The Voice North Bay&#x27;s LGBT Community, which was a monthly newspaper for 27 years.

==Music and opera==

Aarons had a love of music and often invited colleagues and friends to his home in California for sing-along parties. In the last decade of his career, Aarons turned to opera, writing the libretto for &quot;Monticello&quot;. Composed by Glenn Paxton, &quot;Monticello&quot; portrays the love affair between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. L. A. Theatre Works produced the original work in 2000.

After the attacks of Sep 11, 2001, Aarons wrote the libretto for &quot;Sara&#x27;s Diary, 9/11&quot;, an opera composed by his collaborator on &quot;Monticello&quot;, Glenn Paxton. A song cycle, this work is a fictional account of a pregnant woman, who, after her husband dies in the tragedy, experiences deeply mixed emotions. It premiered at the Spreckels Performing Arts Center on Sep 8, 2003 in commemoration of the unprecedented attacks.

==&quot;Prayers for Bobby&quot;==

In 1989 Aarons read a newspaper article about the suicide of a young gay man, Bobby Griffith, and its effects on his mother. After he left daily journalism in 1991, he researched the story in depth. The result was his first book, published by HarperCollins in 1995, &quot;Prayers for Bobby: A Mother&#x27;s Coming to Terms with the Suicide of Her Gay Son&quot;. He did not see it presented to a large viewership before he died. &quot;Prayers for Bobby&quot; premiered on January 24, 2009, as a Lifetime TV film starring Sigourney Weaver in her first made-for-television film.

==Other works==

In 1991 Aarons revisited the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot; case, co-authoring the docudrama &quot;Top Secret: The Battle for the Pentagon Papers&quot; with Geoffrey Cowan. That year it aired on National Public Radio, performed by Ed Asner and Marsha Mason. The play won the Corporation for Public Broadcasting&#x27;s Gold Award for best live entertainment program on public radio. &quot;Top Secret&quot; still tours colleges nationwide as a production of L.A. Theatre Works.

==Death==

On November 28, 2004, Leroy Aarons died of cancer in Santa Rosa, California. He was 70 years old.

At the time of his death, Aarons was working on another play, &quot;Night Nurse&quot;, about South Africa&#x27;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, for which he and his life partner of 24 years, Joshua Boneh, had spent a month in South Africa doing research. An actor and producer in Berkeley, California performed it as a work-in-progress in Mill Valley. The play has not yet been completed.

<text>Meaux Abbey (archaic, also referred to as &quot;Melsa&quot;) was a Cistercian abbey founded in 1151 by William le Gros, 1st Earl of Albemarle (Count of Aumale), Earl of York and 4th Lord of Holderness, near Beverley in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England.

A chronicle of its history was written by Thomas Burton, one of the abbots. The abbey owned the land of Wyke, which was purchased from it by King Edward I of England in 1293 to establish the town of Kingston upon Hull.

The abbey was closed in 1539 by King Henry VIII. It was demolished, and the stones were used to build defences for the town of Kingston upon Hull.

The site of the abbey is a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

<text>During the Dachau liberation reprisals, German SS troops were killed by outraged U.S. soldiers and concentration camp prisoners at the Dachau concentration camp on April 29, 1945, during World War II. It is unclear how many SS guards were killed in the incident, but most estimates place the number killed at around 35–50. In the days before the camp&#x27;s liberation, SS guards at the camp had forced 7,000 inmates on a death march that resulted in the death of many from exposure and shooting. When Allied soldiers liberated Dachau, they were variously shocked, horrified, disturbed, and angered at finding the massed corpses of prisoners, and by the combativeness of some of the remaining guards who allegedly fired on them.

==Discoveries==

On April 29, 1945, scouts of the 522nd Field Artillery Battalion located a satellite camp next to the small Bavarian town of Lager Lechfeld, adjacent to Hurlach. Afterwards, soldiers of the 3rd Battalion, 157th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Felix L. Sparks, approaching the sprawling Dachau complex from the southwest, found 39 railway boxcars containing some 2,000 skeletal corpses parked on rail tracks just outside the complex itself. Brain tissue was splattered on the ground from one victim found nearby with a crushed skull. The smell of decaying bodies and human excrement and the sight of naked, emaciated bodies induced vomiting, crying, disbelief, and rage in the advancing troops. Advancing soldiers from H Company, 22nd Regiment, used a loudspeaker to call on the SS to surrender, but they continued to fire in bursts.

Upon moving deeper into the complex, and the prisoner area itself, the soldiers found more bodies. Some had been dead for hours or days before the camp&#x27;s capture and lay where they had died. Soldiers reported seeing a row of concrete structures that contained rooms full of hundreds of naked and barely clothed dead bodies piled floor to ceiling, a coal-fired crematorium, and a gas chamber. &quot;The stench of death was overpowering,&quot; Sparks recalled.

==Surrender==
Two days prior to the liberation, &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Eduard Weiter had already begun evacuating the camp, prioritizing Russian POWs and Jewish prisoners as they were considered the most dangerous in the event of a liberation by American soldiers. According to Harold Marcuse, American professor of German history, &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; Martin Weiss, who had been left in command of the camp, together with the camp guards and the SS garrisons, had also fled before the arrival of U.S. troops. &quot;SS-Untersturmführer&quot; Heinrich Wicker (killed after the surrender) was left in charge and had roughly 560 personnel at his disposal; these came from conscripted inmates of the SS disciplinary prison inside the Dachau concentration camp and Hungarian Waffen-SS troops.

On April 29, Dachau was surrendered to Brigadier General Henning Linden of the 42nd Infantry Division of the U.S. Army by &quot;Untersturmführer&quot; Wicker. According to Linden, he arrived at the command post in Dachau at about 15:00 and proceeded to make his way across the Amper River to the site of the complex, approximately one-half kilometre south of the bridge he crossed. He proceeded to take control of the camp in some tumult; thereafter, he toured the camp with a group of reporters (including war correspondent Marguerite Higgins). A description of the surrender appears in Linden&#x27;s memorandum to Maj. Gen. Harry J. Collins, entitled &quot;Report on Surrender of Dachau Concentration Camp&quot;:

==Capture &quot;communiqué&quot;==
Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower issued a &quot;communiqué&quot; regarding the capture of Dachau concentration camp: &quot;Our forces liberated and mopped up the infamous concentration camp at Dachau. Approximately 32,000 prisoners were liberated; 300 SS camp guards were quickly neutralized.&quot;

Military historian Earl Ziemke describes the event:

==Killings by U.S. soldiers==


===Sparks account===
Lt. Col. Sparks, a battalion commander of the 157th Infantry Regiment, 45th Infantry Division wrote about the incident. Sparks watched as about 50 German prisoners captured by the 157th Infantry Regiment were confined in an area that had been used for storing coal. The area was partially enclosed by an L-shaped masonry wall about high and next to a hospital. The German POWs were watched over by a machine gun team from Company I. He left those men behind to head towards the center of the camp where there were SS who had not yet surrendered; he had only gone a short distance when he heard a soldier yell, &quot;They&#x27;re trying to get away!&quot; and then machine-gun fire coming from the area he had just left. He ran back and kicked a 19-year-old soldier nicknamed &quot;Birdeye&quot; who was manning the machine gun and who had killed about 12 of the prisoners and wounded several more. The gunner, who was crying hysterically, said that the prisoners had tried to escape. Sparks said that he doubted the story; Sparks placed an NCO on the gun before resuming his journey towards the center of the camp. Sparks further stated:

===Buechner account===
In the U.S. military &quot;Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau&quot; conducted by Lt. Col. Joseph Whitaker, the account given by Howard Buechner (then a first lieutenant in the United States Army and medical officer with the 3rd Battalion, 157th Infantry) to Whitaker on May 5, 1945, did not contradict the Sparks account. Buechner&#x27;s sworn testimony was that around 16:00 he arrived in the yard where the German soldiers had been shot, and that he &quot;saw 15 or 16 dead and wounded German soldiers lying along the wall&quot;. He noted that some of the wounded soldiers were still moving, but he did not examine any of them. He answered &quot;Yes, sir&quot; when asked if he was the surgeon of the 3rd Battalion, 157th Infantry, at that time, and did not know if any medical attention was called for the wounded.

According to Buechner&#x27;s 1986 book, &quot;Dachau: The Hour of the Avenger: An Eyewitness Account&quot;, U.S. forces killed 520 German soldiers, including 346 killed on the orders of 1st Lt. Jack Bushyhead, in an alleged mass execution in the coal yard several hours after the first hospital shooting. Buechner did not witness the alleged incident, and his sworn testimony was that he &quot;saw 15 or 16 dead and wounded German soldiers lying along the wall.&quot; His sworn testimony in the official investigation report also did not include any mention of a second shooting. David L. Israel disputed this account in his book &quot;The Day the Thunderbird Cried&quot;:

Jürgen Zarusky also concluded that Buechner&#x27;s claims were incorrect.

===Other accounts===
Abram Sachar reported, &quot;Some of the Nazis were rounded up and summarily executed along with the guard dogs.&quot;

According to Jürgen Zarusky (originally published in a 1997 article in &quot;Dachauer Hefte&quot;), 16 SS men were shot in the coal yard (one more killed by a camp inmate), 17 at Tower B, and perhaps a few more killed by U.S. soldiers in the incident. Anywhere from as few as 25 or more than 50 were killed by inmates. Zarusky&#x27;s research makes use of the detailed interrogation records contained in Whitaker&#x27;s official May 1945 investigation report, which became accessible in 1992, as well as a collection of documents compiled by General Henning Linden&#x27;s son.

The Dachau liberation reprisals were documented among others by U.S. Army photographers Paul Averitt, George Gaberlavage, Sidney Rachlin and Ed Royce, Sr.

==Killings by the inmates==
Walenty Lenarczyk, a prisoner at Dachau, stated that following the camp&#x27;s liberation &quot;prisoners swarmed over the wire and grabbed the Americans and lifted them to their shoulders... other prisoners caught the SS men... The first SS man elbowed one or two prisoners out of his way, but the courage of the prisoners mounted, they knocked them down and nobody could see whether they were stomped or what, but they were killed.&quot; Elsewhere in the camp SS men, Kapos and informers were beaten badly with fists, sticks and shovels. There was at least one incident where US soldiers looked away as two prisoners beat a German guard to death with a shovel, and Lt. Bill Walsh witnessed one such beating. Another soldier witnessed an inmate stomping on an SS trooper&#x27;s face until &quot;there wasn&#x27;t much left.&quot; When the soldier said to him, &quot;You&#x27;ve got a lot of hate in your heart,&quot; he simply nodded.

An American chaplain was told by three young Jewish men, who had left the camp during liberation, that they had beaten to death one of the most sadistic SS guards when they discovered him hiding in a barn, dressed as a peasant.

==United States Army investigation==
Lt. Col. Joseph Whitaker, the Seventh Army&#x27;s Assistant Inspector General, was ordered to investigate after witnesses came forward testifying about the killings. He issued a report on June 8, 1945, called the &quot;Investigation of Alleged Mistreatment of German Guards at Dachau&quot;, also known as &quot;The I.G. Report&quot;. In 1991, an archived copy was found in the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and made public.

Whitaker reported that close to the back entrance to the camp, Lt. William P. Walsh, commander of Company &quot;I&quot;, 157th Infantry, shot four German soldiers in a boxcar who had surrendered to him. Pvt. Albert C. Pruitt then climbed into the boxcar and performed a &quot;coup de grâce&quot; on the wounded men.

After he had entered the camp, Walsh, along with Lt. Jack Bushyhead, the executive officer of Company &quot;I&quot;, organized the segregation of POWs into those who were members of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and those who were in the SS. The SS were marched into a separate enclosure and shot by members of &quot;I&quot; Company with several different types of weapons.

The investigation resulted in the U.S. military considering courts-martial against those involved, including battalion commander Lt. Col. Felix Sparks, while Lt. Howard Buechner was cited in the report for dereliction of duty for not giving medical aid to the wounded SS men in the coal yard. However, Gen. George S. Patton, recently appointed military governor of Bavaria, chose to dismiss the charges. Therefore, the witnesses to the killings were never cross-examined in court.

Col. Charles L. Decker, an acting deputy judge advocate, concluded in late 1945 that, while there had probably been a violation of international law, &quot;in the light of the conditions which greeted the eyes of the first combat troops, it is not believed that justice or equity demand that the difficult and perhaps impossible task of fixing individual responsibility now be undertaken&quot;.

<text>The Pont des Arts () or Passerelle des Arts () is a pedestrian bridge in Paris which crosses the River Seine. It links the and the central square (&quot;cour carrée&quot;) of the Palais du Louvre, (which had been termed the &quot;Palais des Arts&quot; under the First French Empire).

== History ==
Between 1802 and 1804, under the government of Napoleon Bonaparte, a nine-arch metallic bridge for pedestrians was constructed at the location of the present day Pont des Arts: this was the first metal bridge in Paris. The engineers Louis-Alexandre de Cessart and Jacques Dillon initially conceived of a bridge which would resemble a suspended garden, with trees, banks of flowers, and benches. Passage across the bridge at that time cost one &quot;sou&quot;.

On 17 March 1975, the French Ministry of Culture listed the Pont des Arts as a national historic monument.

In 1976, the Inspector of Bridges and Causeways (&quot;Ponts et Chaussées&quot;) reported several deficiencies on the bridge. More specifically, he noted the damage that had been caused by two aerial bombardments sustained during World War I and World War II and the harm done from the multiple collisions caused by boats. The bridge would be closed to circulation in 1977 and, in 1979, suffered a 60-metre collapse after a barge rammed into it.

The present bridge was built between 1981 and 1984 &quot;identically&quot; according to the plans of Louis Arretche, who had decided to reduce the number of arches from nine to seven, allowing the look of the old bridge to be preserved while realigning the new structure with the Pont Neuf. On 27 June 1984, the newly reconstructed bridge was inaugurated by Jacques Chirac, then the mayor of Paris.

The bridge has sometimes served as a place for art exhibitions, and is today a &quot;studio &quot;en plein air&quot;&quot; for painters, artists and photographers who are drawn to its unique point of view. The Pont des Arts is also frequently a spot for picnics during the summer.

The Argentine writer, Julio Cortázar, talks about this bridge in his 1963 book &quot;Rayuela&quot;. When Horacio Oliveira goes with the pythia and this tells him that the bridge for La Maga is the &quot;Ponts des Arts&quot;.

In 1991, UNESCO listed the entire Parisian riverfront, from the Eiffel Tower to the end of the Ile Saint Louis, as a World Heritage Site. Therefore, the Pont des Arts is now a part of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Love locks ==
Since late 2008, tourists have taken to attaching love locks with their first names written or engraved on them to the railing or the wire netting on the side of the bridge, then throwing the key into the Seine river below, as a romantic gesture. This gesture is said to represent a couple&#x27;s committed love. Although this is not a French tradition and has only been taking place in Paris since the end of 2008, with locks occasionally being cut off by city workers, since 2012 the number of locks covering the bridge has become overwhelming, with locks being attached upon other locks. In February 2014, &quot;Le Monde&quot; estimated that there were over 700,000 locks; with the 2014 summer tourist season, many thousands more have since been added, creating a serious safety concern for city authorities and an aesthetic issue for Parisians.

By 2014, concern was being expressed about the possible damage the weight of the locks was doing to the structure of the bridge. In May, the newly elected mayor, Anne Hidalgo, announced that she was tasking her First Deputy Mayor, Bruno Julliard, with finding alternatives to love locks in Paris. In June, part of the parapet on the bridge collapsed under the weight of all of the padlocks that had been attached to it.

In August 2014, the Paris Mayor&#x27;s Office began to say publicly that they wanted to encourage tourists to take &quot;selfies&quot; instead of leaving love locks, when they launched the &quot;Love Without Locks&quot; campaign and social media hashtag. The web site states: &quot;Our bridges can no longer withstand your gestures of love. Set them free by declaring your love with #lovewithoutlocks.&quot; With the high tourist season in full swing, more than 50% of the panels on the Pont des Arts had to be boarded over with plywood because the weight of the locks (estimated by the city to be 700 kg per panel) was creating the risk of more panels collapsing.

On 18 September 2014, the City Hall of Paris replaced three panels of this bridge with a special glass as an experiment as they search for alternative materials for the bridge where locks cannot be attached.

From 1 June 2015, city council workmen from Paris started to cut down all the locks after years of complaints from locals. Health and Safety officials said &quot;the romantic gestures cause long term Heritage degradation and danger to visitors&quot;. As of 2015, over a million locks were placed, weighing approximately 45 tons. Street artists like Jace, El Seed, Brusk or Pantonio have been chosen to paint the new panels that replaces the old railings with locks.

== Access ==

By foot from Quai François Mitterrand from the right bank of the Seine, and Quai Malaquais or Quai de Conti from the left bank.

== Popular culture ==

Due to its recognizable nature, the bridge has been featured in numerous films and television shows. &quot;Le Pont des Arts&quot; directed by Eugène Green is the story is of a young man who falls in love with and finds the whole meaning of his life contained in a young woman who sings a baroque lament on record. He discovers she committed suicide from the Pont des Arts, so that is the only way he can be with her too. The action unrolls in Paris between 1979 and 1980, in other words it occurs during the collapsing of the bridge. The film was presented in 2004 at the 57th Locarno International Film Festival.

The bridge was used in the last scene of the 1995 film &quot;Sabrina&quot;, and appeared on the 2004 finale of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

The bridge has also been featured in the 2013 Hollywood heist adventure film &quot;Now You See Me&quot;, directed by Louis Leterrier, where Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent) is met by Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo). Alma takes a lock and a key that Dylan produces, putting the lock on a chain fence and throwing the key into the Seine.

Art historian Kenneth Clark wrote about the Pont des Arts in his book &quot;Civilisation&quot;:

St. Germain released a song called &quot;Pont Des Arts&quot; on his 2000 album &quot;Tourist&quot;. Garden City Movement released a song by the same name in 2014.

The bridge was the site of love lock-unlocking tasks on &quot;Amazing Race&quot; and &quot;HaMerotz LaMillion 3&quot;. The bridge also served as the Pit Stop for the fifth leg of &quot;The Amazing Race 32&quot;.

Honoré de Balzac described the bridge in &quot;Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes&quot; as follows:

The bridge served as a prominent venue for the iconic performance by internationally renowned French superstar Aya Nakamura during the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The ceremony unfolded throughout the city, with the Seine River serving as a central focal point.

<doc id="1229145" wikidata="Q777727" url="?curid=1229145" title="From the House of the Dead">
<text>From the House of the Dead () is an opera in three acts by Leoš Janáček. The libretto was translated and adapted by the composer from the 1862 novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky. It was the composer&#x27;s last opera, premiered on 12 April 1930 at the National Theatre Brno, two years after his death. The United States premiere of the work took place at Lincoln Center in 1989 when the New York City Opera mounted a production led by conductor Christopher Keene with a cast starring Harlan Foss as Alexandr Petrovič Gorjančikov, John Absalom as Filka Morozov, Jon Garrison as Skuratov, and John Lankston as Šapkin.

==Composition history==
Janáček worked on this opera from February 1927 to 8 June 1928, knowing that it would be his last, and for it he broke away from the habit he had developed of creating characters modeled on his love interest Kamila Stösslová, although the themes of loneliness and isolation can clearly be seen as a response to her indifference to his feelings. There is only one female character, and the setting, a Siberian prison, presents a large ensemble cast instead of one or several prominent leads. There is no narrative to the work as a whole, but individual characters narrate episodes in their lives, and there is a play-within-a-play in act 2.

&quot;From the House of the Dead&quot; was virtually finished when Janáček died. Two of his students, believing the orchestration was incomplete, &quot;filled out&quot; large portions of the score and adapted the ending to be more optimistic in tone. In addition to the work of Břetislav Bakala and Osvald Chlubna, made changes to the text and sequence of events in the opera. Decades later, a version closer to the composer&#x27;s intentions superseded that version, and it is the one most often heard today. Some productions, however, still use the earlier version&#x27;s ending to lessen the bleakness of the story.

The opera requires a vast orchestra, including chains as a percussion instrument to evoke the sound of the prisoners. The words of prisoners&#x27; songs from the Dostoevsky novel are used in full or in part by Janáček.

An arrangement in the form of a suite of the opera by conductor František Jílek has been performed by the Brno Philharmonic.

One critic has suggested that by pursuing extreme high and low sonorities in this opera, Janáček was cutting out its heart, the orchestral mid range, in an attempt to convey human heartlessness.

==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
&quot;A Siberian prison camp on a winter morning&quot;

The prisoners get up, two get into a dispute, as the rumour is spread that a nobleman will be the new arrival (&quot;Přivednou dnes pána&quot;). He is Alexandr Petrovitch Goryantchikov, a political prisoner. The prison governor interrogates him and orders him to be flogged (&quot;Jak tě nazývají&quot;). The prisoners have found a wounded eagle and tease the bird until the guards order them to their work (&quot;Zvíře! Nedá se!&quot;). The prisoners lament their fate (&quot;Neuvidí oko již&quot;); one of them, Skuratov, recalls his previous life in Moscow (&quot;Já mlada na hodech byla&quot;). Another, Luka Kuzmitch, tells how he incited a rebellion and killed an officer in his first prison camp (&quot;Aljeja, podávej nitku&quot;). Just as he describes his own flogging, Goryantchikov is dragged in, half dead (&quot;Aljeja! Niti!&quot;).

===Act 2===
&quot;Six months later, at the Irtysh river&quot;

Goryantchikov has befriended the young Tartar Alyeya, asks him about his family and offers to teach him to read and write (&quot;Milý, milý Aljeja&quot;). The prisoners finish work as a holiday begins and a priest blesses the food and the river (&quot;Alexandr Petrovič, bude prazdnik&quot;). Skuratov tells his story: He loved a German girl, Luisa, but when she was to be married to an old relative, Skuratov shot the groom (&quot;Jaj, já pustý zbytečný člověk&quot; – &quot;Přešel den, druhý, třetí&quot;). For the holiday, the prisoners stage a play about Don Juan and Kedril (&quot;Dnes bude můj poslední den&quot;) and the pantomime about a beautiful, but unfaithful miller&#x27;s wife (&quot;Pantomima o pěkné mlynářce&quot;). After the play, a prisoner tries to provoke Goryantchikov, as the nobleman has the means to drink tea even in prison (&quot;Pěkně hráli, co?&quot;). Alyeya gets injured.

===Act 3===
&quot;The prison hospital&quot;

Goryantchikov looks after Alyeya, who is happy that he now knows how to read and write (&quot;Isak, prorok boží&quot;). Luka lies dying of tuberculosis and insults Tchekunov for his servile mannerism towards Goryantchikov.

<text>Lawrencia Ann &quot;Bambi&quot; Bembenek (August 15, 1958 – November 20, 2010), known as Laurie Bembenek, was an American security officer at Marquette University when she was arrested on charges of first-degree murder of Christine Schultz in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on May 28, 1981. Bembenek was convicted and sentenced in 1982 to life in prison.

Schultz was the ex-wife of Elfred O. &quot;Fred&quot; Schultz, a veteran officer with the Milwaukee Police Department. They had been married for several years and had two sons together when they divorced in November 1980. Bembenek and Fred Schultz married in January 1981 in Illinois, but the marriage was ruled invalid because Wisconsin does not allow remarriage less than six months after divorce. The couple officially remarried in November 1981, after Christine Schultz had been murdered.

The elements of the case made it a sensation, garnering national attention during the trial. In 1984 Bembenek and Fred Schultz divorced. In prison she completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

She gained even more media notice in 1990 after she escaped from Taycheedah Correctional Institution in Wisconsin. After three months, she and her fiancé were captured in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. (This episode inspired books, movies, and the slogan &quot;Run, Bambi, Run&quot;.)

Upon winning a new trial, Bembenek pleaded no contest to second-degree murder in exchange for reduced prison time. Ballistics tests had appeared to establish her husband&#x27;s gun as the murder weapon, and she had access to it.

In December 1992 Bembenek was sentenced to time served and ten years&#x27; probation. For years, she sought to have her sentence overturned. With the revelation of new evidence about the lack of her DNA at the scene, a ballistics test showing the murder weapon was different than Schultz&#x27;s gun, and evidence of an unknown male at the victim&#x27;s house, Bembenek sought to have her conviction overturned. Appeals were unsuccessful because of her nolo contendere plea.

Bembenek had graduated from the police academy and served briefly with the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), before being fired in August 1980 during her probationary period. She sued the department, claiming that its officers engaged in sexual discrimination and other illegal activities, but the investigation did not uphold her complaint.

Two years after gaining freedom in November 1992, Bembenek moved to Vancouver, Washington, where her parents lived. She worked at volunteer and paying jobs and married again. On November 20, 2010, Bembenek died at a hospice facility in Portland, Oregon, at age 52.

==Early life==
Lawrencia Ann Bembenek was the youngest of three girls; she was born on August 15, 1958 to Joseph and Virginia Bembenek in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Her father Joseph had worked for the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) but quit after witnessing what he described as corruption there. He later worked as a carpenter.

Raised Catholic, Bembenek attended St. Augustine&#x27;s Elementary School and St. Mary&#x27;s Academy in Milwaukee. She later transferred to Bay View High School, where she graduated in 1976. Bembenek attended Bryant &amp; Stratton College in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where she earned an associate degree in fashion merchandising management.

==Career and marriage==
After college, Bembenek returned to Milwaukee, where she worked in retail and had a brief stint as a model. In 1978, she appeared as &quot;Miss March&quot; in a calendar distributed by the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company.

In March 1980, Bembenek began training at the Milwaukee police academy. While still a trainee, she was accused by an anonymous tipster of smoking marijuana at a party. Bembenek denied the charge, which was investigated but never substantiated.

While still at the academy, Bembenek met and became close with Judy Zess, another female trainee. Bembenek graduated from the academy in the summer of 1980 and was assigned to the MPD&#x27;s South Side Second District.

In her autobiography &quot;Woman on the Run&quot; (1992), Bembenek later claimed that the MPD was then composed of &quot;brutal, lazy, apathetic and corrupt&quot; police officers. She also said that female and minority officers were routinely subjected to harassment and abuse during training. Bembenek also said that when female and minority trainees joined the department, they were routinely punished or even fired for minor infractions during their probationary period, while white male officers went unpunished for more serious offenses.

At a rock concert in May 1980, Zess was arrested for smoking marijuana. This violated her probation as a new officer and she was fired. Bembenek was dismissed from the Milwaukee Police Department on August 25, 1980 because of her involvement in filing a false report related to Zess&#x27;s May arrest.

After being fired, Bembenek discovered scandalous photos of several veteran MPD officers, including Elfred O. &quot;Fred&quot; Schultz (her future husband), dancing nude on picnic tables in Gordon Park, after drinking at a nearby tavern. She took the pictures to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), where she argued that she had been dismissed for a minor infraction, but the male police officers were committing more serious violations (as shown in the photos), and did so with impunity. The EEOC encouraged Bembenek to file a discrimination report with the MPD&#x27;s internal affairs division.

Later, Bembenek briefly worked as a waitress at the Playboy Club in Lake Geneva. Around this time, Bembenek met Fred Schultz, who was already a thirteen-year veteran of the MPD.

Schultz divorced his wife, Christine, in November 1980. They had two young sons, Sean and Shannon. She had custody of the boys.

Bembenek and Schultz married in January 1981 in Waukegan, Illinois. 
They shared an apartment with her friend Judy Zess, and Zess&#x27;s boyfriend Thomas D. Gaertner.

Bembenek began working as a personal trainer at a health club. By May 1981 she was working as a campus security officer at Marquette University in Milwaukee.

A judge ruled the Schultz couple&#x27;s marriage was invalid, stating that Schultz had violated Wisconsin law by not waiting six months after his divorce to remarry. Bembenek and Schulz married again in November 1981.

==Murder of Christine Schultz==
On May 28, 1981, at approximately 2:15 a.m., Christine J. (Pennings) Schultz was murdered in her Milwaukee home. She was shot point blank into her back through her heart by a single shot from a .38 caliber pistol. Christine was gagged and blindfolded, and her hands were tied in front of her with a clothes line.

Her two sons, Sean and Shannon, then 11 and 7 years old, were asleep in the house when the assailant entered their room. They found their mother face down on her bed and bleeding. The older boy, Sean, saw the assailant, which he described as a masked male figure in a green army jacket and black shoes. He also said the man had a long (approx. 6&quot; or 15 cm) reddish-colored ponytail.

Christine and Fred Schultz had been divorced six months when she was killed. Fred Schultz initially said he was on duty investigating a burglary with his partner, Michael Durfee, at the time of the murder. Years later he admitted the two men were drinking at a local bar.

When ballistics testing allegedly revealed that his off-duty revolver was the murder weapon, suspicion shifted to Bembenek. She had been alone at home, in the apartment she shared with Fred Schultz. She had access to both the gun and a key to Christine&#x27;s house, which Fred Schulz had secretly copied from his oldest son&#x27;s house key. After the police investigated, they arrested Bembenek for Christine Schultz&#x27;s murder on June 24, 1981.

Fred Schultz had previously been investigated in the fatal shooting of a Glendale, Wisconsin police officer, George Robert Sassan, on July 23, 1975. Sassan had arrested a subject in a bar while off-duty. Milwaukee police officers, including Schultz, responded to the call in suburban Glendale (outside of their jurisdiction), reportedly mistook Sassan for a suspect, and fatally shot him when he turned toward them, holding a gun. Schultz and his partner were cleared in the shooting, exonerated by the Milwaukee County District Attorney&#x27;s Office.

===Trial and conviction===
Bembenek&#x27;s trial generated tremendous publicity. Newspapers began referring to her as &quot;Bambi&quot; Bembenek (a nickname she disliked). The prosecution portrayed Bembenek as a loose woman addicted to expensive living who wanted Christine Schultz dead so that her new husband would no longer have to pay alimony and child support.

Noting that Bembenek had financial problems, the prosecution claimed that she was the only person with the motive and means to carry out the crime. The gun used to kill Christine was Bembenek&#x27;s husband&#x27;s off-duty revolver; the prosecution claimed Bembenek was the only person besides Schultz who had access to the gun, which had blood on it. Bembenek supposedly also had access to a key to Christine&#x27;s home. There were no signs of a break-in and no valuables taken. These were all elements of circumstantial evidence.

The strongest evidence, however, was two human hairs found at the crime scene, which matched ones taken from the hairbrush of the defendant. But Schultz&#x27;s eldest son, an eyewitness, said he could not identify Bembenek as the person he had seen in the house and who shot his mother. Bembenek had dyed blonde hair, weighed 140 pounds and was .

Prosecution witnesses testified that Bembenek had spoken often of killing Christine. The prosecution produced a witness who said Bembenek offered to pay him to carry out the murder. According to witnesses for the prosecution, Bembenek owned a green jogging suit similar to the one described by Schultz&#x27;s son. Other evidence was her owning a clothes line and a blue bandanna similar to what were used to bind and gag the victim. A wig found in the plumbing system of Bembenek&#x27;s apartment matched fibers found at the murder scene. A boutique employee testified that Bembenek had purchased such a wig shortly before the murder.

On March 9, 1982, the jury found Bembenek guilty of first-degree murder; she was sentenced to life in prison. She was imprisoned at the Taycheedah Correctional Institution in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.

==Post-trial publicity, events and appeals==
While Fred Schultz had initially stood by Bembenek, claiming she was innocent, he later changed his mind and in 1989 publicly stated that he believed she was &quot;guilty as sin.&quot; They had been divorced in 1984. Bembenek in turn came to believe that Schultz was guilty of having hired a man named Freddy Horenberger to murder Christine, and allowed Bembenek to take the fall.

Horenberger, along with an accomplice, had been questioned days before the murder by a deputy with the Milwaukee County Sheriff&#x27;s Office about an unrelated crime. Horenberger had briefly worked with Fred Schultz on a remodeling project. He was also a former boyfriend of Judy Zess, who testified for the prosecution against Bembenek. A disguised Horenberger had robbed and beaten Zess several weeks prior to Christine Schulz&#x27;s murder. Later he was convicted for that crime and sentenced to ten years in prison.

Bembenek contended that the attorney whom her husband had hired to represent her had a conflict of interest. Her attorneys said that the first attorney purposely failed to inform the jury that there was evidence connecting her husband Schultz to his ex-wife&#x27;s murder.

After her imprisonment, Bembenek filed three unsuccessful appeals of her conviction, citing police errors in handling of key evidence. She also noted the fact that one of the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses, Judy Zess, had recanted her testimony, stating it was made under duress. Bembenek and her supporters also alleged that the MPD may have singled her out for prosecution because of her role as a key witness in a federal investigation into police corruption. Bembenek&#x27;s supporters agreed with her claim that Horenberger, at the behest of Fred Schulz, had murdered Christine.

Following Bembenek&#x27;s conviction, numerous affidavits were filed that alleged that, while imprisoned, Horenberger boasted to other inmates of having killed Christine Schulz. However, he publicly denied any involvement in the murder until his alleged suicide in November 1991. This followed his participation in a robbery and hostage situation.

Questions were raised as to the accuracy of evidence used in the Bembenek trial. Dr. Elaine Samuels, the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy, had originally concluded that hairs recovered from Christine&#x27;s body were consistent with those of Christine Schulz herself. The hair evidence was also examined by Diane Hanson, a hair analyst from a crime lab in Madison, Wisconsin and prosecution witness. She said that two of the hairs were consistent with samples taken from Bembenek&#x27;s hairbrush.

But, Dr. Samuels refuted that claim. In a 1983 letter, published in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 1991, she stated that,

The apartment where Bembenek and Schultz lived shared drainage with another apartment. A brownish-red wig was found in the drainpipe, which matched some of the hairs found on the victim&#x27;s body. The woman who occupied the other apartment testified that Zess had knocked on her door and asked to use her bathroom; after Zess used the woman&#x27;s bathroom, the plumbing was clogged. Zess had also admitted to owning a brownish-red wig.

==Bembenek&#x27;s prison years==
About a year after she went to prison, on June 28, 1983, Bembenek filed for divorce from Fred Schultz. In an interview she gave to &quot;The Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; earlier that year, Bembenek said that Fred had written her a letter saying that he was living with a 19-year-old woman in Florida and had decided to end their marriage. Their divorce was granted on June 19, 1984.

While in prison, Bembenek earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Wisconsin–Parkside. She also helped found a prisoners&#x27; newspaper. She met and became engaged to factory worker Dominic Gugliatto, brother of her cellmate.

==Escape and capture==
On July 15, 1990, Bembenek escaped through a laundry room window and was picked up by her fiancé, Gugliatto. The couple were spotted in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin two days after Bembenek&#x27;s escape, driving in Gugliatto’s truck. The abandoned truck was later found in a parking lot of a Target.

Bembenek and Gugliatto fled to Thunder Bay, Ontario while sensational stories about their relationship swirled through American tabloids. Her escape also reignited publicity surrounding her case, and she became something of a folk hero. A song was written about her, and T-shirts were sold with the slogan &quot;Run, Bambi, Run&quot;.

While on the run, Bembenek used the name &quot;Jennifer Gazzana&quot; and got a job working as a waitress. The couple evaded capture for three months. She also worked as a fitness instructor.

On October 17, 1990, the couple were arrested after a tourist saw a segment about Bembenek&#x27;s escape on &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; TV series. Gugliatto was deported to the United States a month later and was eventually sentenced to one year in prison for his role in the escape.

Bembenek sought refugee status in Canada, claiming that she was being persecuted by a conspiracy between the police department and the judicial system in Wisconsin. The Canadian government showed some sympathy for her case. Before returning her to Wisconsin, it obtained a commitment that Milwaukee officials would conduct a judicial review of her case. Although the review did not find evidence of crimes by police or prosecutors, it did list seven major police blunders that had occurred during the Christine Schultz murder investigation.

As a result, Bembenek won the right to a new trial. Bembenek voluntarily returned to the United States on April 22, 1991. Rather than risk a second conviction and in order to get out of prison earlier, she pleaded no contest (&quot;nolo contendere&quot;) to second-degree murder during a hearing held on December 9, 1992.

Bembenek was sentenced to 20 years, which was commuted to time served. She was released from custody three hours after the hearing, having served a little more than ten years.

==Life after prison==
Bembenek wrote a book about her experience, titled &quot;Woman on Trial&quot; (1993). After her release, she had various legal and personal problems: she was arrested again on possession of marijuana and filed for bankruptcy.

She was diagnosed with hepatitis C, which she had acquired from her mother at birth, and had other liver and kidney problems. She admitted to being an alcoholic. She legally changed her name to Laurie Bembenek in July 1994.

In 1996, she moved to Washington state to be near her retired parents in Vancouver. There she met U.S. Forest Service employee Marty Carson. They married in 2005.

Bembenek was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, complicated by a growing addiction to alcohol. Carson encouraged her to devote time to her passion of painting as a form of therapy. Bembenek had been painting since childhood, and her early work had been the subject of an exhibition at University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 1992. Carson constructed a studio for her, and she eagerly returned to her art. After several years she had amassed about 30 paintings, which she put on display at a local art gallery. The gallery burned down and she lost all the paintings.

In 2002, Bembenek either fell or jumped from a second-story window, breaking her leg so badly that it had to be amputated below the knee. Bembenek said that she had been held in an apartment by handlers in preparation for appearing on the &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; television show. A spokesman for the show said they intended to protect her from media harassment. Bembenek said the confinement felt too much like her time in solitary in prison; she tried to escape and suffered the injury. She sued Dr. Phil, Paramount and 52 staffers from the show.

Bembenek continued to proclaim her innocence, but the Wisconsin Supreme Court refused to overturn her &quot;no contest plea&quot;, saying that such a plea cannot be withdrawn. In April 2008, Bembenek filed a petition with the United States Supreme Court, seeking a reversal of the second murder conviction. Bembenek&#x27;s attorney pointed to evidence withheld in the original trial, including ballistics tests that showed the murder bullets did not match Fred Schultz&#x27;s gun, male DNA found on the victim, evidence showing that the victim had been sexually assaulted, and the eyewitness testimony of the two young sons who claimed that the intruder was a heavyset, masked man. Bembenek&#x27;s petition argued that the court needed to clarify whether defendants who plead guilty or no contest have the same right to review evidence as those who plead not guilty. Her appeal was denied in June 2008.

===Death===
On November 20, 2010, Bembenek died at a hospice facility in Portland, Oregon, from liver and kidney failure.

==Representation in other media==
Her case inspired two television movies, a podcast and various books and articles. 
*&quot;Woman on the Run: The Lawrencia Bembenek Story&quot; (1993) is an American drama film written and directed by Sandor Stern. It is adapted from Bembenek&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Woman on Trial&quot;. It stars Tatum O&#x27;Neal and Bruce Greenwood.

<doc id="1229155" wikidata="Q540320" url="?curid=1229155" title="Labor Party (Mexico)">
<text>The Labor Party (, , PT; also known as the Workers Party) is a socialist political party in Mexico. It was founded on 8 December 1990. The party is currently led by Alberto Anaya.

Following the 2018 election, the PT became the third-largest political party in the Chamber of Deputies with 61 deputies, after Morena with 191 and the PAN with 81. Political maneuvering briefly established the PRI as the third-largest party in August 2020, although it later turned out that the PT and the PRI were tied with 46 seats each after doubtful PRD deputy defections in favor of the PRI.

It received 6.46% of the total votes cast in the 2024 presidential election, becoming the sixth national political force. It has 49 deputies and 6 senators in the LXVI legislature of the Congress of the Union.

==History==
=== Foundation ===

==== Initial History ====
Following the coordination of several social groups, including the Independent Teachers&#x27; Movement, the National Union of Agricultural Workers (UNTA), the National Coordinator &quot;Plan de Ayala,&quot; the Popular Front of Struggle of Zacatecas, the Popular Front &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot; of Monterrey, the of Durango and Chihuahua, and the Popular Union of Agricultural Workers, the PT formed.

The party first participated in federal elections in 1991, but it failed to win 1.5 percent of the vote (the amount necessary to be recognized as a national party). In 1994, Cecilia Soto became the presidential candidate.

=== 1998–2006 ===
In 1998 the PT allied with the larger Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) for the first time in the state of Zacatecas. In the 2000 elections, the party took part in the PRD-led Alliance for the Good of All. As part of the Alliance, it won 7 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 1 seat in the Senate.

The PT ran separately from the PRD in the 2003 elections for the Chamber of Deputies. The party won 2.4 percent of the popular vote and 6 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

In November 2005, the PT endorsed the PRD&#x27;s candidate for President, Andrés Manuel López Obrador for the July 2006 elections. In these elections the party won 12 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 3 out of 128 Senators.

In October 2006, the PT further allied itself with the PRD and the Convergence Party to form the Broad Progressive Front (FAP for its Spanish initials), which was granted the register by the Federal Electoral Institute.

===2012 Mexican general election===
In 2012 the PT supported PRD presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

===2018 Mexican general election===
The 2018 Mexican general election was the fifth presidential election PT had participated in. Its candidate for the Presidency was Andrés Manuel López Obrador as PT formed a coalition with left-wing National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and right-wing Social Encounter Party (PES).

==== Background ====
On 24 June 2017, the PT approved to stand for election in 2018 in an electoral alliance with MORENA, however the coalition was not officially registered before the National Electoral Institute, the electoral authorities of the country. From MORENA, the alliance was facilitated as a result of the decline of the PT candidate Óscar González Yáñez, who resigned his candidacy requesting the vote in favor of Delfina Gómez Álvarez, standard-bearer in the state elections of the State of Mexico in 2017.

At first, there was speculation about the possibility of a front grouping all the leftist parties: MORENA, PRD, PT and Citizens&#x27; Movement (MC). However, Andrés Manuel López Obrador rejected any kind of agreement due to political differences, especially after the elections in the State of Mexico, when the candidates of the PRD and MC continued with their campaigns refusing to support the candidate of MORENA. At the end of November 2017, the leaders of MORENA and the PES announced that they were in talks to form a possible alliance. In this sense, Hugo Eric Flores Cervantes, President of PES, said, &quot;We don&#x27;t negotiate with the PRI, we have two options, go alone or with MORENA.&quot;

==== Confirmation ====
On December 13, the coalition between Morena, the PT and the PES was formalized under the name Juntos Haremos Historia (English: Together we will make history). Following the signing of the agreement, Andrés Manuel López Obrador was appointed as a pre-candidate for the three political formations. It is a partial coalition that will promote López Obrador as a presidential candidate and, with respect to the legislative elections: MORENA will have to choose candidates in 150 federal electoral districts and 32 districts to the Senate; 75 deputies and 16 senators for PT and 75 deputies and 16 senators for the PES.

The alliance has received criticism as it is a coalition between two leftist parties (MORENA and the PT) with a formation related to the evangelical right (PES). In response, the national president of MORENA, Yeidckol Polevnsky, mentioned that her party believes in inclusion, joint work to &quot;rescue Mexico&quot; and that they will continue to defend human rights, while Hugo Eric Flores Cervantes, national president of the PES, mentioned that &quot;the only possibility of real change in our country is the one headed by Andrés Manuel López Obrador&quot; and that his party had decided to put &quot;on the right side of history.&quot;

== Platform ==
The current party platform seeks to maintain the policies of the so-called &quot;4T&quot; these policies include, deepen federalism, and decentralize federal government duties. It encourages a socialist market economy as an alternative to neo-liberalism. It advocates for judicial reform, including the election of ministers by popular vote. To reform the educational system, they seek to incorporate socialist, left-wing, and progressive organizations. Through its relationships with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, it aims to advance Latin Americanism in international politics; Furthermore, recognize the State of Palestine formally.

==Election results==
===Presidential elections===
===Congressional elections===

====Chamber of Deputies====
Due to a number of party changes among legislators, in September 2020 the PT became tied for the third-largest political party in the Chamber of Deputies, after Morena and the PAN, but tied with the PRI, with 34 seats each.

====Senate elections====

<text>Kumeū is a town in the Auckland Region, situated north-west of the City Centre in New Zealand. State Highway 16 and the North Auckland Line pass through the town. Huapai lies to the west, Riverhead to the north, Whenuapai to the east, and Taupaki to the south.

The wider area has been settled by Tāmaki Māori since the 13th or 14th centuries, and the area is of significant importance to Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara and Te Kawerau ā Maki. The Kumeū River valley was an important transport node between the Kaipara and Waitematā harbours, due to a portage called Te Tōangaroa, where waka could be hauled overland. 

Kumeū village developed in the 1870s after the construction of the Kumeu–Riverhead Section, a railway on Te Tōangaroa that linked Kumeū to Riverhead. Over the latter 19th century, the town transitioned from a centre for the kauri logging and kauri gum trades into an agricultural centre. The Kumeu Stockyards opened in 1915, and from 1921 the town began holding a large-scale agricultural show called the Kumeu Show. By the 1940s, Croatian New Zealanders had developed a winemaking industry in the area. Since the 1970s, Kumeū and Huapai have grown to become a single urban area, often referred to as Kumeū-Huapai.

==Etymology==

The name Kumeū in Māori language originally referred to the north-east of Taupaki village, to the south of modern-day Kumeū. The name is associated with one of the earliest ancestors of the modern Te Kawerau ā Maki iwi, Te Kauea, who was of the early iwi Tini ō Toi (the people of Toi-te-huatahi). During the battle that preceded the peace accord, a (woman warrior) pulled at her breast when calling her warriors to revenge an insult, giving rise to the name &quot;Kume-ū&quot; (&quot;Pull Breast&quot;).

The first print references to the Kumeū River in English date from the 1850s, followed by references to the Kumeu Road District in 1861. References to Kumeu and Kumeu Flats as a settlement begin from 1867.

The traditional Māori name for Kumeū is .

==Geography==
Kumeū is a town north-west of Auckland, located along the Kumeū River, a major tributary of the Kaipara River. It is located to the east of Huapai, and the two towns share a conurban metropolitan area, and is close to the towns of Riverhead (to the north-east) and Waimauku, to the west past Huapai. Urban West Auckland suburbs are located to the south-east of Kumeū, including Westgate and the NorthWest Shopping Centre.

The Kumeū River area has traditionally been a wetland and flood plain, prior to European settlement. The Kumeū valley regularly flooded during the 1920s and 1930s, and a major flood occurred in 1954.

Kumeū has a substantial amount of lifestyle blocks.

==History==
===Māori history===

The Auckland Region has been settled by Māori since around the 13th or 14th centuries. Some of the first tribal identities that developed for Tāmaki Māori who settled in the wider area include Tini o Maruiwi, Ngā Oho, Ngā Iwi, and Tini ō Toi, the latter of whom descend from Toi-te-huatahi. Many place names in the Kumeū River valley reference Te Kauea, a member of Tini ō Toi. Tāmaki Māori legends describe supernatural beings as the inhabitants of the area known as the Tūrehu, who lived in areas such as the Waitākere Ranges.

While the Kumeū River valley was sparsely populated by Tāmaki Māori due to poor soil quality not suited to traditional crops, it was an important transportation node due to Te Tōangaroa, a portage where waka could be hauled between the Kaipara Harbour and the Waitematā Harbour, via the Kaipara and Kumeū rivers. Major settlements in the area were typically upland of the Kaipara and Kumeū rivers.

Around the 15th century, a group known as Ngāti Awa who descended from the &quot;Mātaatua&quot; waka settled Te Korowai-o-Te-Tonga Peninsula, led by Tītahi. The iwi were prominent constructors of terraced pā. By the mid-17th century, Ngāti Awa and Ngā Oho struggled to control territory. A descendant of Tītahi, Hauparoa, to ask his relative, a renowned warrior, to migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region. Maki conquered and unified many of the Tāmaki Māori tribes, including those of West Auckland and the southern Kaipara, leading to the development of Te Kawerau ā Maki as a tribal identity.

In the 17th and early 18th centuries, Ngāti Whātua tribes began migrating south of the Kaipara Harbour. Initially relations between the iwi were friendly, and many important marriages were made. Hostilities broke out and Ngāti Whātua asked for assistance from Kāwharu, a famed Tainui warrior from Kawhia. Kāwharu&#x27;s repeated attacks of the Waitākere Ranges settlements became known as Te Raupatu Tīhore, or the stripping conquest. Lasting peace between Te Kawerau ā Maki and Ngāti Whātua was forged by Maki&#x27;s grandson Te Au o Te Whenua, who fixed the rohe (border) between Muriwai Beach and Rangitōpuni (Riverhead). Ngāti Whātua divided the land among different hapū, including Te Taoū, who were the major power in the Kaipara River catchment.

Around the year 1740, war broke out between Ngāti Whātua and Waiohua, the confederation of Tāmaki Māori tribes centred to the southeast, on the Tāmaki isthmus. Kiwi Tāmaki, paramount chief of Waiohua, led a surprise attack in the south Kaipara during an uhunga (funeral rite commemoration), in response for past grievances and to assist a Ngāti Whātua faction who were opposed to Te Taoū. By 1741, Ngāti Whātua had successfully fought against Kiwi Tāmaki, both sides often using the portage at Kumeū. Following the end of the conflict, members of Te Taoū established themselves on the Auckland isthmus, and a Ngāti Whātua kāinga was settled in the Kumeū area, until the 1820s.

During the Musket Wars of the 1820s, Ngāti Whātua and Te Kawerau ā Maki vacated the area, returning in the late 1820s and 1830s. The Ngāti Whātua village was not resettled after the war. During modern times, the area is considered parts of the rohe of Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara and Te Kawerau ā Maki.

===Early colonial era===

After the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840, Ngāti Whātua operated coastal trading vessels, supplying goods to early European settlers at Auckland. The first land blocks of the Kumeū River valley were purchased by the Crown from Ngāti Whātua in 1853, with remaining blocks sold between 1868 and 1890. Ngāti Whātua sold land in the hope that this would lead to Europeans settlements developing and stimulate the economy of the area. Often land sales had negligible profits for Ngāti Whātua, due to the cost of the Native Land Court bureaucracy, surveying costs, advertising and auction costs, ad often land was sold to speculators who did not intend to settle in the area. The Kumeū River valley was difficult to navigate, and a narrow dray road was constructed primarily by Ngāti Whātua in the 1850s.

After the establishment of the Albertland settlements at Port Albert and Wellsford in the early 1860s, the Kaipara River and Kumeū River valley saw increased traffic. Road conditions along the Kumeū River valley were so poor and the Kaipara Harbour mouth too treacherous for most ships, that the Albertland settlers petitioned the government for better transportation links, fearing that they would starve. The Kaipara Harbour was not a priority for the government, who instead focused on developing logistically important locations south of Auckland during the Invasion of the Waikato, but by 1865 the government had agreed to fund road improvements. Ngāti Whātua, hoping for better infrastructure in the area, sold a narrow strip of land between the Awaroa Creek and Riverhead in 1866.

The first references to European settlement begins in 1867, with the mention of a court case involving a store at Kumeu Flats, owned by Mr. Vidal of Auckland and illegally operated by James Ensor. By the 1870s, the first families had settled in the Kumeū River valley.

===The Kumeu–Riverhead railway===

Ngāti Whātua of the southern Kaipara struggled financially during the 1870s, as the increase in settlers and trade had not eventuated, leading Ngāti Whātua to sell further land blocks. By 1877, most of the Kumeū River valley had been sold, with Ngāti Whātua communities remaining at Reweti, Woodhill and the Kaipara Harbour coast, no longer having a presence in the Upper Waitematā Harbour.

In 1875 after four years of construction, a railway between Kumeū and Riverhead was opened. Kumeū land owner Thomas Deacon gifted land for the railway, which led to the construction of two railway stations: Kumeū in the south, and one near his hotel at modern Huapai (then variously called Pukekorari, Kumeu Flat, or Kumeu North), which was established in 1877. The railway brought more settlers to the Kumeū-Huapai area. Initially the Kumeu Flat area was developed by Deacon into a village, with Kumeū remaining a rural for longer. The villages of Kumeū and Taupaki slowly grew during this period, and the first Kumeu Hall was constructed by 1876. The hall became a hub for the community, used as a school, church and for social events.

Shortly after the Kumeu–Riverhead Section opened, Auckland area residents pressured the government for a continuous rail link between Auckland and Helensville, to bypass the need to cross the Waitematā Harbour and Kaipara River by boat. Construction on the extended North Auckland Line from New Lynn north began in 1879, employing many men who lived at Kumeū and Taupaki, who helped to construct a tunnel for the railway line. The service opened in 1881, in the same year that the Kumeu–Riverhead Section was shuttered. This caused significant growth in the Kumeū area, and the surrounding communities gradually gravitated towards the railway stations along the North Auckland Line.

From 1884, kauri loggers were drawn to the Kumeū area, after the opening of the railway made logging financially possible in the area. Kauri gum diggers were also drawn to the area between 1880 and 1900, and local resident Tom Deacon ran a combined kauri gum camp and general store at Kumeū. 

===Rise of agriculture and World War II===
Farmers were increasingly drawn to the Kumeū area from the 1880s, as land was gradually cleared of forest, kauri gum and flax. Initially most farmers ran sheep farms, but by the 1890s dairy farming had become more viable. By the turn of the 20th century, settlers to the area primarily arrived from Britain, Australia, and other parts of New Zealand, joined by Yugoslav, Croatian and later Dutch communities during the early to mid-20th century.

The Kumeū River valley was promoted as a fruit growing area during the 1910s, and approximately north of Kumeū were developed into apple and pear orchards by Northern Fruitlands Ltd as the Huapai estate. A new Kumeu hall opened in 1913, becoming the centre for the wider district for the next 60 years. The Kumeū Catholic Church was established in 1915, on land donated by Dalmatian immigrant Martin Lovich, becoming the focus for both Catholic and Croatian communities in the wider area.

In 1915, Alfred Buckland established the Kumeu Stockyards adjacent to the railway, and fortnightly livestock auctions became a major fixture of Kumeū for much of the 20th century. From 1921, the Kumeu Show became a major annual event for the community.

By 1936, 311 people were living in Kumeū and the surrounding areas, with 303 people at Huapai. Winemaking was established at an industry at Kumeū in the early 1940s, led by Croatian families such as Nick and Zuva Nobilo, and Mick and Katé Brajkovich.

During World War II, the RNZAF Base Auckland was established to the east at Whenuapai, becoming the main hub of operations for the New Zealand Defence Force. Wary of the threat of Japanese airstrikes, a decoy airforce base was established at Kumeū, and wooden Hudson bombers were constructed. While primarily a decoy, the airstrip was used by pilots training to use Tiger Moths. During the war, the Kumeū Hall became a popular socialisation spot for servicement based at Whenuapai, and for United States marines based at Muriwai.

===Industrial centre and winemaking===

A commercial centre developed at Kumeū in 1957, after the establishment of Wally Reber&#x27;s transport business. The winemaking industry underwent a boom in the 1960s and 1970s, including vineyards such as San Marino (now known as Kumeū River Valley), Gilbey Nobilo. Corbans bought vineyeards in the area, and in 1960 Selaks relocated to Kumeū after their Te Atatū vineyard was requisitioned to construct the Northwestern Motorway.

In the 1970s, industrial firms began opening operations in Huapai and Kumeū, including a Carters timber yard, and the New Zealand Particle Board factory, both opening in 1972. During this period, the villages began to merge into a single urban area.

In 2019, the name of the town was officially gazetted as Kumeū, although it is common to see it spelt without the macron.

The Kumeu Showgrounds are also the venue for the annual Auckland Folk Festival, a 4-day event of music, dancing and workshops, now in its 46th year. The festival is generally held over the last weekend in January.

== Transport ==
The railway network&#x27;s North Auckland Line passes through Kumeū. For six years the town was the terminus of the isolated Kumeu-Riverhead Section railway, which linked Kumeū to Riverhead, where ferries ran to Auckland. It operated from 1875 until 1881. In 1881, the North Auckland Line reached Kumeū, making the town a railway junction. This status lasted a mere five days; the new railway from Auckland made the line to Riverhead redundant and it was accordingly closed.

In June 2007 it was announced that suburban rail services would be extended to Helensville in 2008, with temporary stations to be built at Huapai and Waimauku. The service commenced on 14 July 2008 for a one-year trial period, and was then suspended permanently in 2009.

==Education==
Kumeū is served by Huapai District School and Matua Ngaru School, which are coeducational full primary schools serving years 1–8 with rolls of and students respectively as at . Huapai District School opened in 1919. Matua Ngaru opened in 2019.

The state integrated Hare Krishna School is a coeducational composite school serving years 1–10 with a roll of students as at .

The majority of high-school-aged students attend schools in surrounding suburbs. The closest secondary schools are Kaipara College, Massey High School, Liston College, Albany Junior High School and St Dominic&#x27;s College.

Kumeu Library is based at Huapai. Since the amalgamation of Auckland Council in 2010, Kumeu Library became a branch of Auckland Libraries. In July 2021, Huapai Service Centre was absorbed into the Library to form the Kumeū Library and council services.

== Local government ==

From 1876 until 1974, Kumeū was administered by the Waitemata County, a large rural county north and west of the city of Auckland. After this, Kumeū became a part of Rodney County. In 1989, the county was abolished, and in its place the Rodney District was formed. Rodney District Council was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010.

Within the Auckland Council, Kumeū is a part of the Rodney local government area governed by the Rodney Local Board. It is a part of the Rodney ward, which elects one councillor to the Auckland Council.

<doc id="1229169" wikidata="Q2452400" url="?curid=1229169" title="Triathlon equipment">
<text>Due to the nature of triathlons as a race consisting of multiple sports many pieces of technical equipment have been borrowed from other sports, or developed specifically in an effort to race faster and improve a competitors safety. 

== Trisuits ==

A trisuit is a single skin tight item of clothing designed specifically for triathlon athletes to provide comfort and remove the necessity to change clothing while switching from swimming to cycling to running. Normally a trisuit is a single item of clothing; however, two-piece versions exist with separate shorts and top. These are mainly chosen for longer races where comfort is more important. All trisuits have a cycling chamois built in for comfort on the bike leg of the competition. However, these are thinner than traditional shorts for cycling to allow the wearer to run without additional friction. Traditionally, trisuits have no sleeves to allow for greater shoulder mobility for swimming, but trisuits with tight-fitting sleeves have become more popular recently. The material of a trisuit is important, as athletes will go from swimming to cycling, the clothing needs to be quick-drying so as to be comfortable for the majority of the cycling. The material also needs to be wicking or breathable, as cycling and running are sweat-producing activities and the trisuit is tight-fitting.

== Watch &amp; Heart rate ==
In modern competition, triathletes often wear a watch to monitor time. This watch may be a smartwatch, tracking other metrics like distance, pace, and speed. A triathlete may also utilize a heart rate monitor, either on the wrist or across the chest, to help maintain a sustainable pace with maximum energy efficiency without &quot;bonking&quot; or &quot;hitting the wall&quot; (becoming too fatigued to continue).

== Swimming equipment ==
Typical equipment for the swim segment include a swim cap, goggles and possibly a wetsuit.

=== Cap and Goggles ===
Swim caps are normally provided by the event with the colours to organise and categorise swimmers by event or by heat. Swim goggles are used to protect the eyes of the swimmer from the water and to allow greater vision when swimming. In some triathlons the swim portion is held in a swimming pool if this is the case no wetsuit is used and no special care is required for the goggles or swim cap. Usually though triathlon swims are done in open water (lakes, rivers, or oceans), therefore extra considerations must be made about equipment.

Due to the reduced visibility of participants in open water bright coloured swimming caps are almost exclusively used to allow swimmers to be seen for both safety and spectators. Swim goggles for open water swimming will often have either coloured or mirrored lenses, because without this light reflecting of the waters surface will dazzle or blind swimmers not allowing them to see where they are swimming.
=== Wetsuits ===
Because most triathlon swim stages that are conducted in open waters are cold, many entrants wear wetsuits. However, typical wetsuits manufactured for snorkeling or surfing are not optimised for swimming, because the tightness at the shoulders generally restrict the range of motion too much for comfortable stroking during the swim. Modern triathlon wetsuits were invented by Dan Empfield in 1987 and are customised to the needs of triathletes, and generally incorporate the following features:

* Thinner and/or more pliable rubber near the shoulders, sleeveless versions are also available.
* Long zippers and sometimes wrist/ankle zippers to facilitate quick removal during transition.

In addition, triathlon wetsuits have a very smooth, but often fragile, surface. This slick surface helps to reduce water friction and allow a faster swim, but it would be easily destroyed by contact with a sandy surfboard. Another advantage of a wetsuit is the added buoyancy around the hips and legs which can provide competitors with a considerable advantage.

Specific rules vary by event, but typically the legality of racing in a wetsuit depends on the water temperature on the day of the event. Wetsuits are disallowed if the water temperature is above a specified threshold and become mandatory if the water temperature is below and optional between the two, for example the British Triathlon rules state that wetsuits are forbidden above 22 °C and mandatory below 14 °C. If not racing in a wetsuit an athlete has the option of wearing any other style of swimsuit allowed by the rules. Under the current ITU rule set , there exists a wetsuit thickness rule. No wetsuit with a thickness of greater than 5mm may be used. Most triathlon wetsuits have thicknesses of 3mm to 5mm.

=== Disallowed aids===
Any artificial propulsion device, such as fins, paddles or swim socks as well as any flotation device except a wetsuit, is prohibited. Headphones or any in ear device such as a tempo timer. Snorkels used to be a grey area with many national federations including that of Canada, Australia and the USA as well as the sports governing body the ITU not specifically disallowing snorkels. However after a change to the ITUs official rule set specifically banning snorkels most national federation have also disallowed. In the U.S., snorkels are forbidden for races held by the ITU and the WTC (Ironman races) but not by USAT. Tom Reilly, a USAT-certified official, closed the debate around the grey rules of USAT by stating officially that snorkels are allowed since not on the forbidden list of items. 

=== Ergometers ===
Some triathletes do not have the luxury of an open water swim environment near where they train, and year-round outside training can be difficult in cold climates. Several swim training products have been created to address this issue including ergometers like the Vasa Swim Trainer or compact swimming treadmills like Endless Pools.

== Cycling equipment ==

===Triathlon bicycles===

Triathlon bicycles are a variant of road-racing bicycles, designed primarily to optimise aerodynamics. Since in most triathlons, cyclists do not draft as in many other forms of road racing, triathletes can gain a significant advantage by riding a bicycle which reduces wind resistance. The most obvious features of a triathlon bicycle are the handlebars, commonly known as &quot;aero-bars&quot; (see below).

In addition, many components of a triathlon bicycle are designed with an aerodynamic profile: frame tubes have an oval or teardrop (instead of circular) cross-section; handlebars may be flat instead of round; wheels may have fewer spokes, or even be carbon fiber tri-spokes or discs rather than conventional spoked wheels. Lastly, a number of &quot;radical&quot; bicycle frames that are illegal in road cycling are still legal in triathlon, so &quot;nontraditional&quot; frame designs are also common, including Zipp 2001, Softride, and Kestrel.

Tri bikes generally have a very &quot;aggressive&quot; geometry, meaning steep (close to vertical) tube angles and a low stem and handlebars relative to the saddle. This position helps to improve aerodynamics by lowering the cyclist&#x27;s torso and creating a smaller overall &quot;drag profile&quot;. In addition, many triathletes feel cycling in this position helps preserve the muscles used in running by emphasising pedalling with non-running muscle groups.

The concept of a tri specific bicycle was pioneered by Ralph Ray and Dan Empfield in the late 1980s. Tri bikes are generally very similar to time trial bicycles used in time trial races. In 1989, Empfield designed the Quintana Roo Superform, a triathlon specific bicycle &quot;built from the aerobars back&quot; which provided an aerodynamic advantage as well as more power when in the &quot;aero&quot; position. Empfield&#x27;s bike had 650c wheels and an 80 degree seat angle which was unique to the period. Many professional triathletes were sceptical of the &quot;steep&quot; design at first but when Ray Browning rode it at Ironman New Zealand breaking the bike and overall course records and left the bike leg with a 30-minute lead over rival Scott Tinley, the concepts were here to stay.

The aerodynamic shape causes somewhat higher weight, even if carbon fiber is used. In very hilly races where a lot of time is spent in slow uphills, a low-weight traditional road bicycle might be preferred.

===Aerobars===
Aerobars, also commonly referred to as &quot;tri-bars,&quot; are handlebars designed to reduce the cyclist&#x27;s wind profile. Triathlon played a key role in the development of cycling with an aero geometry during the 1980s. Aerobars are used in other forms of cycling, such as time trials and some events in track cycling.

Instead of the familiar curved &quot;drop bars&quot; of road bicycles, aerobars are mounted to a set of &quot;pace bars&quot; or &quot;bull-horns&quot;. A pair of bars stretches straight forward from the centre of these handlebars at the stem of the fork. Padded cups or pads in the middle of the bars support the athlete&#x27;s elbows and/or forearms while the hands are stretched forward to hold the centre bars. This position keeps the rider&#x27;s elbows in close to the body and lowers his or her torso compared to the usual upright position.

The brake levers are mounted on the side horns; the rider will hold these instead of the centre bars when braking or manoeuvring is required. Often the shifters for the derailleur gears are mounted at the tips of the aero bars allowing the athlete to change gear ratios without compromising their aerodynamic position.

Riding with aerobars is facilitated by adopting a steep seat-tube angle, often referred to as an &quot;aggressive&quot; geometry. The forward nature of this positioning is not as easy to control as traditional seat tube angle and upright position. Manoeuvrability is compromised for an aerodynamic body position when a bike is fitted with low aerobars.

The International Triathlon Union regulates the size of aerobars used in competition for draft-legal races. Triathlons allowing drafting promote cycling as a group on the cycle leg of the triathlon, allowing athletes to compete with a very aggressive geometry compromises safety as vulnerability is reduced. Professional triathletes competing in these races use &quot;shorty&quot; aerobars mounted on traditional drop handlebars.

===Triathlon shoes===
Triathlon shoes are similar to other forms of cycling shoe used in racing, with automatic binding cleats (clipless) that snap the cyclist&#x27;s feet to the pedals. Tri shoes are often optimised for this approach: they may be padded to allow comfortable use without socks, have holes to allow water from the swim to drain easily, and have only one or two velcro straps for ease of fastening rather than the three straps, laces, or ratcheting buckles found on modern road racing shoes. It is not uncommon for the Velcro straps used to close from the outside of the foot inwards, this non-traditional configuration keeps the opened straps away from the chain and bicycles, preventing the possibility of entangling them if pedaling with unstrapped shoes early or late in the race.

Many competitive triathletes choose to leave their shoes clipped onto the pedals for the entire duration of the race in order to save time during transitions. This means the athlete is jumping onto the bicycle with wet, bare feet after the swim, and will pedal up to a reasonable speed, with his or her feet sitting on top of the shoes, before pausing to slip the feet inside the shoes and fasten them. Likewise, the athlete will pull his or her feet out of the shoes while coasting up to the bike-run transition area and run barefoot into the transition corral rather than attempt to run on the awkward cycling cleats.

===Hydration systems===

As with everything else, triathletes often strive to make their water bottles as aerodynamic as possible, and often to reduce the need to reach for a water bottle - which may interrupt pedaling and slow the racer down. Triathletes have tried placing water bottles in unusual locations, such as in a bracket behind the saddle, on the theory that the bottles are shielded from the wind by the body. However, a recent wind-tunnel study by &quot;Triathlete Magazine&quot; discovered that this approach is actually counterproductive because it interrupts the laminar flow of air down the athlete&#x27;s curved back. A 2003, wind tunnel study by Dan Empfield found that the best configuration was a single water bottle on the bike&#x27;s downtube (it smoothed airflow to the seat tube and rear wheel). This caused less drag than having no waterbottle at all. The most drag was 2 water bottles; one on the down tube and one on the seat tube.

A number of products have been created to satisfy triathlete&#x27;s demands for aerodynamic hydration systems. Examples include the Aerodrink system by Profile Design, an aero bottle that hangs from the handlebars with a straw so the athlete can drink without using his hands; and the Neverreach system, a teardrop-shaped reservoir mounted behind the seat with a tube running up to the handlebars. In addition, certain high-end triathlon bicycles have a hydration system integrated into the frame&#x27;s tubing itself.

On long-distance triathlons, the participants will get filled bottles by the organiser during the race as replacement for the used ones. If using special bottles, the received bottle should be emptied into own bottle, and immediately thrown. Bottles hanging from the handlebars are generally prepared for this. To throw bottles outside aid stations is not allowed. In Ironman own aid suppliers are not allowed.

===Wheels===
A vast array of low-weight and/or aerodynamic wheels exist for racing bicycles. Some (such as wheels with an aerodynamic ring, flat spokes, and fewer spokes than the traditional 32) are legal for use in most cycling events, while others such as carbon-fiber tri-spokes (wheels with only three large, rigid spokes) generally are only legal in triathlons and time-trials. Typically wheels that are lighter are preferred and, although this is an obvious consideration, it is not the only one. Higher profile wheels (larger rim) are conducive to laminar flow of air past them more so than traditional thin rimmed wheels.

Solid disc wheels are used as well, though in outdoor settings these are generally not used on the front wheel because they are difficult to handle in crosswinds. Disc wheels provide a significant aerodynamic advantage when mounted on the rear wheel improving laminar flow over the rear half of the bike. Recent developments in technology have given rise to disc wheels with a dimpled surface like a golf ball, also in the name of aerodynamics. Disc wheels are not permitted at the Ironman World Championships in Kona Hawaii, as large crosswinds are not uncommon and present an unsafe situation to athletes.

Some triathlon bikes use 650c wheels (a nominal diameter of 65 centimeters) rather than the conventional 700c wheels used on nearly all road bikes. The smaller wheels weigh less, have a smaller cross-sectional area (reducing wind resistance), and reduce the overall wind resistance of the bicycle by bringing the frame and cyclist closer to the ground. A potential drawback is that the smaller diameter means a higher curvature at the tire&#x27;s contact patch, which increases rolling resistance. Which effect is more prominent depends on the cyclist and the windiness and steepness of the course.

===Other components===
Many triathletes can be quite fixated with improving the aerodynamics and lowering the weight of their bicycles. As a result, the triathlon industry has developed a whole host of components which improve myriad characteristics of the bicycle. Examples include chainrings which have no holes or gaps (increasing aerodynamics a minuscule amount at the cost of a few grams of weight), brake and shifter cables which run inside the bicycle frame, and components of all sorts made from carbon fiber composite rather than steel or aluminum, in order to save weight.

==Running equipment==

===Shoes===

Normal running shoes are used by most athletes, but triathlon-specific shoes do also exist. One difference between runner&#x27;s shoes and triathlete&#x27;s shoes is that the triathlete&#x27;s shoes may have a hole cut in to the heel to allow water to drain out, keeping the shoes from becoming saturated and heavy. This is especially important on longer run courses, where a minor annoyance can become painful. This is also more common in an aquathlon event where athletes go from swimming straight to running, carrying much more water into the shoe.

===Elastic Shoelaces===
Triathletes often replace their shoelaces with laces made of elastic, which allows a triathlete when racing them to pull on the shoes without stopping to tie the laces. This saves a time during the bike to run transition, in fact most athletes find that their finger dexterity is reduced due to tiredness meaning lacing shoes takes longer than expected. The laces work by being threaded tight like normal laces but then a clamping mechanism holds a pre-set the tension of the laces providing support to the wearer but the flex in the elastic allows enough give to slide the shoes on and off. The most well known brand of such laces that are designed specifically for triathlon are Lock Laces.

===No Socks ===
Socks are often forgone on short course races, as they cannot be worn during the swim and the time required to put them on is seen as time that cannot be recovered. If socks are worn, they are normally trainer socks which are faster to put on. Not using socks can cause abrasion which might be painful. Triathletes often practice running the intended distance in the racing shoes without socks. On the long course races most athletes will wear socks, especially for the run, as the comfort provided is seen to outweigh the time lost. Also on long course events some athletes use long compression socks with the expectation that the socks will enhance endurance .

==Triathlon-specific transition equipment==
Triathlon, even more so than other multi-sport races, is distinctive because athletes must transition between the three disciplines (swimming, cycling, and running) while the clock is still running on the race. As a result, triathletes have come to rely on particular equipment (in addition to some of the equipment above) to either speed up the transition process, or make it a more comfortable one.

===Race number belts===
A race number belt is a simple, elastic belt with a plastic slide-in buckle. As its name suggests, athletes often attach race numbers to this belt, so they can quickly clip it on during the transition before the run. This method allows athletes to not wear the race number (also referred to as a &quot;bib&quot;) until the last leg of the race, when it is needed for official purposes (Note: some races also require wearing the bib during the bike portion, in that case on the back. Please refer to specific race rules for your race). It also makes attachment fast and easy, and avoids the need to pin the bib though one&#x27;s clothing. During races which require race numbers during the bike leg, wearing a race number belt makes it easy to display the race number properly: athletes slide the belt to show their bib number on their backs whilst cycling, and then slide the belt to display the number on the front during the run.

===Rubber bands===
Especially in professional races, rubber bands are used to speed up the transition process by using them to suspend cycling shoes upright on a bike, while the shoes are already clipped in to the pedals. The athlete will then run with the bike out of the transition area, hop on the bike with the shoes already on it, and immediately start pedaling. The rubber bands will break on the first pedal stroke, and the athlete will then begin pedaling, riding with his or her feet on top of the shoes until the terrain is calm enough to put his or her feet into the shoes while still riding the bike. This low-tech method can save tens of seconds in the race.

=== Talcum Powder ===
Talcum powder is placed in both sets of shoes to in an extra attempt to absorb any excess moisture and keep the foot dry

<text>The North Atlantic Conference (NAC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference which competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III. Member schools are primarily small liberal arts colleges in the New England states of Maine, Massachusetts and Vermont, as well as the Mid-Atlantic state of New York.

The conference was founded in 1996 when six colleges agreed to form the North Atlantic Women&#x27;s Conference. It changed to its current name in the fall of 1999. It currently sponsors a total of 17 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports played by teams of the 13 institutions therein.

The 17 different sports that are played in the NAC range from the fall season, throughout the winter, and to the spring season. These sports are played among both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams.

In the fall season, there are six sports played. Among these are, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, field hockey, men&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s tennis, and women&#x27;s volleyball.

In the winter season there are two sports played, which are men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball along with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving.

In the spring time there are four sports both for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. The NAC has men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, baseball, softball, men&#x27;s tennis, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field.

<text>The 33rd Division was an infantry division of the British Army that was raised in 1914, during the First World War. The division was raised from volunteers for Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies, that was originally made up of infantry battalions raised by public subscription or private patronage. The division was taken over by the War Office in September 1915. It served in France and Belgium in the trenches of the Western Front for the duration of the war. The division&#x27;s insignia was the &quot;double-three&quot; from a set of dominoes.

== Formation history ==
The Division was one of the six created for the Fourth New Army on 10 December 1914. It landed in France in November 1915. Major-General Herman Landon took command of the division on its arrival. It saw action at the Battle of the Somme in autumn 1916 and, after Major General Reginald Pinney had taken command, it also saw action at the Battle of Arras in April / May 1917 and the Battle of Passchendaele in autumn 1917.

<text>Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort, originally to be named Tempo Bay Hotel and previously the Contemporary Resort Hotel, is a resort located at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. Opened on October 1, 1971, the hotel is one of two original properties located at the complex alongside Disney&#x27;s Polynesian Village Resort, and is currently listed as a deluxe-priced resort. It is adjacent to the Magic Kingdom theme park, and is identified by its A-frame main building.

==History==

The Contemporary Resort is one of two resorts located on property when Walt Disney World opened in 1971.

The Contemporary Tower, the most prominent of the resort&#x27;s three stand-alone buildings, was built as an A-frame with outer walls which slope inwards around an inner atrium. This design was a collaboration by Disney, the United States Steel Corporation, and Xerox Tower architect Welton Becket. To construct the building, steel frames were erected on-site and modular pre-constructed rooms, designed by California architect Donald Wexler, were lifted into place by crane. The original buildings at Disney&#x27;s Polynesian Village Resort the Court of Flags Resort and one residential property at Bay Hill (using the first four units off the assembly lines) were all built the same way, except these rooms were stacked instead of slid in.

In 2006, Disney filed plans for a project on the site of the Contemporary Resort&#x27;s North Garden Wing. Bay Lake Tower ultimately contained 281 timeshare units. In preparation for the future sale, Disney incorporated a condominium association for the property on January 9, 2007, that would manage the units. The project was officially unveiled on September 16, 2008. Timeshares began on September 28, 2008, to existing Disney Vacation Club members and on October 5, 2008, for new members.

In 2005, Disney began an extensive renovation of the Contemporary Resort, and it was completed in 2009. As part of the construction, the North Garden Wing of the hotel was demolished to make way for a separate Disney Vacation Club resort that opened in 2009. At the same time, the Bay Lake Tower began construction. Disney&#x27;s Racquet Club was demolished by January 30, 2007, while the North Wing itself was demolished between January 31 and April 6, 2007. Construction on the new building continued through 2007, without Disney announcing what was actually being built. The Bay Lake Tower opened in 2009.

===Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1973 press conference===

On November 17, 1973, the Contemporary was the site of what would become one of the most famous press conference statements in modern American politics, where President Richard Nixon declared, &quot;I am not a crook.&quot; Nixon, whose job approval rating had been declining steadily for over a year due to the on-going Watergate scandal, made the statement during an appearance at the Associated Press Managing Editors Association annual convention, at which he held a live one-hour televised press conference. Following an earlier question on Nixon&#x27;s taxes, Nixon addressed claims that he profited from his public service, stating &quot;I&#x27;ve earned every cent. And in all of my years of public life I have never obstructed justice ... People have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I&#x27;m not a crook. I&#x27;ve earned everything I&#x27;ve got.&quot; Less than one year later, facing almost certain impeachment and removal from office, Nixon announced his resignation in a national speech on August 8, 1974, which became effective the following day.

==Layout==
===Main building===

====Rooms and facilities====
The Contemporary Tower houses most of the resort&#x27;s key facilities, including resort registration and the guest service concierge. The main hall, named the Grand Canyon Concourse, is located in main tower and houses restaurants and shops. 383 guest rooms line the outer walls of the Contemporary Tower. The Walt Disney World Monorail System runs through the inside of this building and a monorail station is located here for resort guests. Adorning the concourse walls is a multi-story mosaic designed by Mary Blair. One three-story wing flanks the south side of the tower and houses an additional 250 rooms. A convention center was added to the resort and opened on November 11, 1991, with more than of convention space. In October 2007, the resort received designation as part of the Florida Green Lodging Program.

In June 2021, Disney Parks Blog announced the rooms had undergone a redesign blending monorail motifs with Incredibles characters.

====Dining====
There are several restaurants in the Contemporary Resort&#x27;s main building. The California Grill is a full-service dining restaurant located at the top (15th floor) of the Contemporary Resort&#x27;s tower, formerly the Top of the World restaurant. A second full-service restaurant, Steakhouse 71, is located on the first floor of the main tower in a space formerly occupied by The Wave ... of American Flavors and, before that, the Fiesta Fun Center arcade. Its theming and name are both inspired by the resort&#x27;s opening year, 1971. Two restaurants, a character buffet (Chef Mickey&#x27;s) and a quick-service facility (Contempo Café), are located on the Grand Canyon Concourse in the main tower&#x27;s atrium, with coffee bars and lounges located throughout the resort complex.

===Bay Lake Tower===
Bay Lake Tower at Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort, part of the Disney Vacation Club, is a 15-story addition that officially opened on August 4, 2009. It is located on the former location of the demolished North Garden Wing rooms. The tower shares design features with the original resort. The front desk, concierge, valet, bell services and transportation are shared services provided through the main resort. Bay Lake Tower has a concierge desk and an online check-in desk of their own for guests who wish to check into Bay Lake Tower directly. Its fifth floor is connected by a skyway from the main tower&#x27;s fourth floor.

The units were among the most expensive offered by Disney Vacation Club at initial offering, presumably because of their proximity to the Magic Kingdom. Some of the resort&#x27;s features include full-length windows with views into the Magic Kingdom or onto Bay Lake. Some bathrooms on the Magic Kingdom side include movable partitions to permit watching the park&#x27;s fireworks displays from the bathtub.

==Incidents==

*On November 12, 1992, an off-duty Cast Member fell off the ledge outside the Top of The World restaurant on the 15th floor of the Contemporary. The cast member had been sitting on the ledge when a swarm of wasps appeared; while trying to swat the wasps away, the cast member lost his balance and fell to his death 11 stories below.
*On March 22, 2016, a person died at Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort. According to multiple sources, the person jumped to their death inside the central A-frame tower.
*On May 28, 2018, an intoxicated man was arrested at Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort after he falsely told other guests an active shooter was in the resort. Panic soon followed and the resort was placed on lockdown until police could arrive. The reports were traced back to the man, who was found hiding in bushes outside of the resort. When questioned, the man claimed that his motive was to get reactions from people for a class and his YouTube channel.
