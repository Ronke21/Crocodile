<text>A prepaid mobile device, also known as a pay-as-you-go (PAYG), pay-as-you-talk, pay and go, go-phone, or prepay, is a mobile device such as a phone for which credit is purchased in advance of service use. The purchased credit is used to pay for telecommunications services at the point the service is accessed or consumed. If there is no credit, then access is denied by the cellular network or Intelligent Network. Users can top up their credit at any time using a variety of payment mechanisms such as the Pay-as-you-go (PAYG). In 2020, 155 countries had the mandatory SIM registration laws for the prepaid mobile SIM cards such as the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) or other type of legal identification verification at the point of sale to prevent the anonymous use of unregistered prepaid mobile which facilitates criminal or terrorist activities. The [[Prepaid_mobile_phone#burner|Burner phone]] is a prepaid phone number specifically purchased without the Know Your Customer (KYC) or other type of legal identification verification at the point of sale; with the purpose of using it briefly and then replacing it, thus making these phone more suitable for the criminal use. 

The alternative billing method (and what is commonly referred to as a mobile contract) is the postpaid mobile phone, where a user enters into a long-term contract (lasting 12, 18, or 24 months) or short-term contract (also commonly referred to as a rolling contract or a 30-day contract) and billing arrangement with a mobile phone operator (mobile virtual network operator or mobile network operator).

==Overview==
A prepaid mobile phone provides most of the services offered by a mobile phone operator. The main difference is that with prepaid phones, payment for service is made before use. As calls and texts are made, and as data is used, deductions are made against the prepaid balance amount until no funds remain (at which time services stop functioning). A user may avoid interruptions in service by making payments to increase the remaining balance.

Methods of payment:
*Credit card, debit card, or online payment processors.
*Direct draw from bank account using an ATM
*Retail store purchase with a &quot;top-up&quot; or &quot;refill&quot; card at retail. These cards are stamped with a unique code (often under a scratch-off panel) which must be entered into the phone in order to add the credit onto the balance.
*Retail store purchase using a swipe card where the balance is credited automatically to the phone after the retailer accepts payment.
*Retail store or online purchase: a person can top-up a prepaid phone in another country by asking for &quot;international top-up&quot;. Often, migrant workers will send prepaid top-up internationally as a form of support.
*Other mobile phones on certain networks which provide international top-up services, where the initiator of the top up is often a migrant worker wanting to add minutes to the prepaid mobile phone of a family member back home.
*Direct from some open-loop prepaid cards featuring a mobile refill service.
*Through electronic reloading where a specially designed SIM card is used to reload a mobile phone by entering the mobile number and choosing the amount to be loaded. This process is widely implemented in the Philippines and India so that any person can be a prepaid load retailer, creating a nationwide availability of reloading stations, even in remote areas.

Credit purchased for a prepaid mobile phone may have a time limit – for example, 120 days from the date the last credit was added. In these cases, customers who do not add more credit before expiration will have their remaining balance depleted through expiration of the credits.

There is no compulsion on a prepaid mobile phone user to top up their balance. To maintain revenues, some operators have devised reward schemes designed to encourage frequent top-ups. For example, an operator may offer some free SMS to use next month if a user tops up by a certain amount this month.

Unlike postpaid phones, where subscribers have to terminate their contracts, it is not easy for an operator to know when a prepaid subscriber has left the network. To free up resources on the network for new customers, an operator will periodically delete prepaid SIM cards which have not been used for some time, at which point, their service (and its associated phone number) is discontinued. The rules for when this deletion happens vary from operator to operator, but may typically occur after six months to a year of non-use.

By 2003, the number of prepaid accounts grew past contract accounts, and by 2007, two-thirds of all mobile phone accounts worldwide were prepaid accounts.

==History==

The history of prepaid mobile phones begins in the 1990s, when larger markets were being sought after by the mobile phone operators. Before this date, all mobile phone services were offered on a
post-paid basis, which excluded people with poor credit.

Prepaid mobile service was invented by Subscriber Computing, Inc., an Orange County company, (1986–1998), founded and directed by Arlene Harris. The patents covering this invention are:

*US-5291543-A, filed 12/5/1990 and awarded on 9/15/1992.
*US-5148472-A, filed 6/24/1992 and awarded in 3/1/1994.

These patents describe the ability to access the cost of a call and deduct the cost of the call from the user&#x27;s account balance in near real time. If the user&#x27;s balance is below the carrier-defined threshold, the next call that the user makes is routed to an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) device that announces to the user that the account balance is low and suggests they add funds to the account so their service is not interrupted. When the user&#x27;s account balance is depleted, the service is suspended until they added funds to their account. If the user&#x27;s account balance is depleted, all call attempts are routed to the IVR. These patents expired in 2010 and 2012 respectively.

The prepaid service was sold to Metro Mobile in June 1989, and was implemented in November 1989.

The prepaid service was also sold to carriers in Mexico; Celcom in 1994, and implementation took place in Monterrey, and to Telcel, where implementation began in November 1997 and production took place beginning in April 1998.

Ericsson also became a partner in the prepaid service; a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed in June 1997 and the final agreement was signed in late 1997. The announcement was made on January 26, 1998 (or listen to it).

Prepaid service enabled carriers in third world countries to add subscribers without having to print monthly statements or having an accounts receivable department, and gave them the ability to add subscribers without concern for their ability to pay their bills.patent holder).

In 1996 MTN became the first mobile operator to introduce a prepaid cellular service in Africa, popularizing &quot;pay as you go&quot; in emerging markets.

The first Prepaid card was called &quot;Mimo&quot; and was launched by TMN, the mobile phone operator of Portugal Telecom, in September 1995. In 2006 Swisscom celebrated ten years with its product and service &quot;NATEL® easy&quot; which also holds a patent on &quot;Prepaid mobile subscriber identification card and method implemented thereby&quot;.

==Versus postpaid==

===Advantages===
A prepaid plan may have a lower cost (often for low usage patterns e.g. a telephone for emergency use) and make it easier to control spending by limiting debt and controlling usage. They often have fewer contractual obligations – no early termination fee, freedom to change providers, plans, able to be used by those unable to take out a contract (i.e. under age of majority). Depending on local laws, they may be available to those who do not have a permanent address, phone number, or credit card. This makes them popular among travelers and students away from their hometowns. Additionally, they are popular with parents who wish to have a way to stay connected with their college age students and have some control over the costs.

===Disadvantages===
Sometimes, pay-as-you-go customers pay more for their calls, SMS and data than contract customers. In some cases they are limited in what they can do with their phone – calls to international or premium-rate telephone numbers may be blocked, and they may not be able to roam. These limitations are usually the results of deficiencies in the prepaid systems used by the wireless carriers, as technology has evolved to the point where these are easily managed by triggers or APIs to third-party solution providers. Current models being deployed by wireless carriers are capable of setting the price points for all services on an individual basis (via packages), such that higher pricing is a marketing decision.

==Churn==
As described above, prepaid accounts require a subscriber to have a credit balance in the account to make outgoing calls (except emergency calls, which are always allowed). In the US, incoming calls are also barred, while in some other countries, a prepaid mobile with zero balance may still receive calls and texts.

This results in an &quot;on/off&quot; or &quot;all or nothing&quot; proposition for the prepaid service providers and their clients (i.e. the account either has enough credit to use the phone, or it does not). Some operators (e.g., Orange) allow their pre-paid customers to have a small negative balance to allow short calls or texts when the customer&#x27;s credit has been completely used. This is then deducted when the customer next adds more credit.

The time most likely for a prepaid customer to switch to a different service provider is when the prepaid account reaches a &quot;zero credit balance&quot;. Like other service providers, mobile service providers losing a mobile account call it &quot;churn&quot;.

==Roaming==
In the early years, a prepaid mobile phone could only be used within the network of the operator from which the customer purchased the phone. It was not possible to roam onto other GSM networks when using the phone abroad. This was because the operator had no way to bill calls in real time from another network.

However, most prepaid phones now offer roaming using one of the following methods:
*The prepaid mobile phone user dials a &quot;trigger&quot; number from the foreign location using a USSD message which is not charged for while roaming. Upon receipt of the USSD, the customer&#x27;s operator will then return the call. When the service calls back, the user is being charged for the cost of the service from the credit available in the home network. The service will then prompt the user to enter the dialed number of the party to be called. The disadvantage of this method of roaming is that the user will not be able to dial numbers directly from the handset. The advantage is that it works in almost all locations around the world since USSD is ubiquitous and free.
*The user can direct dial from their handset if the network they are roaming in supports CAMEL (Customized Applications for Mobile networks Enhanced Logic). This allows real time billing by the home operator without having to dial the customer back. The advantage is that it is more natural and works seamlessly. The disadvantage is that not all networks support CAMEL so the list of countries where a prepaid customer can use their phone abroad is smaller than for postpaid mobile phones.

==Privacy rights==
Burner phone is a prepaid phone number specifically purchased without KYC or identity registration with the purpose of using it briefly and then replacing it. Such a phone is colloquially known as a &quot;burner phone&quot; or simply . A Los Angeles technology company developed a mobile application of the same name that replicates this functionality for a smartphone. United States Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced legislation requiring consumers to produce identification before buying pre-paid phones in 2010, which was not passed.

As of January 2020, research found that governments of 155 countries have been mandating SIM registration laws such a mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) or other type of legal identification verification at the point of sale; in some countries, prepaid users must submit biometrics like photos and fingerprints. Since July 2013, at least 80 countries globally (including 37 on the African continent) have mandated, or are actively considering mandating, the registration of prepaid SIM users. 

There is a concern by police and security agencies that anonymous use of prepaid mobile services facilitates criminal or terrorist activities. Prepaid phone users can be anonymous for two reasons:

* In certain countries, there is no mandatory legal requirement to register the phone in the name of buyer at point of sale in shops by conducting KYC or other type of legal identification verification, unlike postpaid phones who have to credit check the user before allowing them to purchase and enter into a contract.

* As prepaid services can often be topped up using cash and vouchers, there is no way to trace the payment and thence determine the identity of a prepaid phone user from payment records.

While there is no doubt that criminals and terrorists use prepaid SIM cards to help stay anonymous and avoid easy detection, to date there has been no empirical evidence to indicate that mandating the registration of prepaid SIM users leads to a reduction in criminal activities or the he lack of any registration of prepaid SIM users is linked to a greater risk of criminal or terrorist activities. This may be due to the fact that the rate of crimes committed using burner phones is rising faster with the rising mobile phone adoption as compared to the ratio of crimes prevented by the mandatory phone registration.

In fact, a publicly available policy assessment report from Mexico showed that mandatory SIM registration introduced there in 2009 had failed to help the prevention, investigation and/or prosecution of associated crimes. As a result, policymakers decided to repeal the regulation three years later.

==International branding==
In an effort to differentiate the prepaid from post-paid service for their customers, CSPs have branded prepaid services differently from the post-paid services. A variant of post-paid service has emerged in recent years that comes closer to the prepaid service, by offering a &quot;pay monthly&quot; contract.

Prepaid phones and SIMs in the United Kingdom are known as &quot;Pay as you go&quot;.

==Usage==
Usage of prepaid cellphone service was common in most parts of the world. In 2012 around 70% of customers in Western Europe and China use prepaid phones with the figure rising to over 90% for customers in India and Africa. 36% of cellphone users in the United States of America were using some form of prepaid service as of 2021. Prepaid SIM cards are also becoming a variation of the traditional prepaid cellphone plans. Rather than needing to purchase an entirely new phone, existing phones can be used by simply replacing the SIM card within the device. Prepaid service has also evolved to include rate plans and buckets traditionally seen in postpaid plans but with a lower cost of ownership for the network operator. Such Advance Pay plans are often monthly plans with either Unlimited Voice/SMS/MMS (or monthly buckets for some of these) and Prepaid Data Volume Add-ons and throttling mechanisms.

<doc id="1234737" wikidata="Q3519972" url="?curid=1234737" title="The Beta Band (album)">
<text>The Beta Band is the debut studio album of the Beta Band, released in June 1999 by Regal Records. The album followed the critically acclaimed compilation of their first three EPs titled &quot;The Three E.P.&#x27;s&quot; (1998). With high anticipation for &quot;The Beta Band&quot;, the band originally planned to record the album in four separate continents, but financial constraints slimmed the recording locations down; however, the album was still recorded in a variety of locations. The band approached creating the songs in a variety of ways, sometimes forming songs from single melodies, sometimes bringing together other strands of music, among other forms.

The album builds upon the experimentation of their EPs, and is often seen as a particularly intricate, experimental and layered album, with a variety of different influences, sound effects, instrumentation and song structures. Based more around beat and rhythm than prior releases, the numerous different styles and influences incorporated into &quot;The Beta Band&quot; include psychedelia, hip hop and blues. Vocalist Steve Mason described his lyrics as fitting but without narrative interests. The band also recorded an ambient bonus disc of two long compositions, &quot;Happiness and Colour&quot; and &quot;The Hut&quot;, but decided not to include the disc in the final release.

Upon its release, the band made their dissatisfaction with the album public, infamously calling it &quot;fucking awful&quot;, largely blaming time constraints. Upon its release, it reached number 18 on the UK Albums Chart. Critics were favourable towards the album, although many found the album particularly messy and disappointing after the EPs. In later years however, several critics have found the album to be underrated and have praised its ambitions. In 2018, as part of a reissue campaign of the band&#x27;s discography, Because Music re-released the album alongside the intended bonus disc.

==Background==
In 1997 and 1998, Scottish-based The Beta Band recorded their first releases, three EPs, &quot;Champion Versions&quot;, &quot;The Patty Patty Sound&quot; and &quot;Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos&quot;, which were met with high critical acclaim. After they had signed to Regal Records, a subsidiary of EMI&#x27;s label Parlophone, the three EPs were released together as the album &quot;The Three E.P.&#x27;s&quot; in September 1998, which similarly was met with positive reviews. In 1999, they signed to Astralwerks in the United States and the label subsequently released &quot;The Three E.P.&#x27;s&quot; in the country. According to writer Ted Hedrickson, the band – consisting of multi-instrumentalists Steve Mason, Robin Jones, Richard Greentree and John MacLean – fused musical elements like ambient drones, trip hop beats and Pink Floyd-style introspective balladry to create their unique sound throughout their EPs, and that these releases &quot;served as a fabulous taster for the band&#x27;s self-titled debut.&quot;

By the time of &quot;The Beta Band&quot;, the group had undergone a successful, quick American tour while having become known in Britain for their live performances. Their gigs typically featured films, a DJ set that they would perform before the show, and quirky on-stage sampling from Mclean. Although anticipation for the band&#x27;s official debut album was high, McLean later admitted they were &quot;sure a bit worried about doing an album.&quot; They would later tour in the United States in promotion of &quot;The Beta Band&quot;.

==Writing and recording==
Each song on the album was approached differently; some songs the band developed from a single idea or melody, while the chords and melodies of others were developed beforehand. Robin Jones stated &quot;We never really had a master plan ... after we did a song, we turned around and tried to do exactly the opposite. The most exciting songs were the ones where we were making something out of nothing.&quot; Describing his lyrics for the record, vocalist Steve Mason explained he typically just followed &quot;the rhythms of the songs, more like a percussionist&quot;, and mentioned that the songs &quot;don&#x27;t really tell a story. It&#x27;s just words that go in there. They mean something, but they don&#x27;t mean…anything.&quot; Despite some critics believing some of the tracks to be pastiches, the band explained to writer Lydia Vanderloo that they were not &quot;really into pastiche or irony or anything&quot;, with Maclean commenting, &quot;Everything&#x27;s very serious and honest, hopefully. We&#x27;re not so scared that we hide behind the irony that a lot of folks seem to hide behind these days.&quot; Mason later explained to Hedrickson about the creation of the songs:

According to Steve Taylor in &quot;The A to X of Alternative Music&quot;, none of the songs were prepared before the band entered the studio, which is where they were &quot;determined to keep their manual looping techniques&quot;. The band&#x27;s original intention for &quot;The Beta Band&quot; was for it to be a double album with each side of the LP recorded in a different continent, &quot;one in Tokyo, one in Mexico and so on&quot;. The band tried to plan this with their manager and Regal owner Miles Leonard, but ultimately Leonard dismissed the idea as impossible: &quot;it would have cost three-quarters of a million pounds or something and they would have lost the plot.&quot;

Instead, according to &quot;Spin&quot;, the album was at least partly recorded in a small hut belonging to Maclean&#x27;s grandfather in a remote northwest part of Scotland, where the group found themselves with no room to sleep as they filled the hut with an excessive amount of musical equipment and homemade instruments. Sawmills Studio, Rockfield Studios and Jacobs Studio were also recording locations for the album. In a 1999 interview, Mclean clarified that separate sections of the albums were recorded in different places: &quot;Four songs here, four songs somewhere else. You know, break it up a bit?&quot; As with the band&#x27;s prior releases, The Beta Band co-produced the album with Chris Allison, who also engineered it, although the band&#x27;s manager later admitted he felt the collaboration was not as successful this time.

===Ambient bonus disc===
In one of their attempts to &quot;make something out of nothing&quot;, the band had originally intended the album to contain a bonus disc of two long-form ambient pieces, &quot;Happiness and Colour&quot; and &quot;The Hut&quot;, both of which lasted over 20 minutes and represented the band&#x27;s desire to &quot;make a record of sound as a description for something like happiness, where a distinct first part gives way to a distinct second part&quot;. The band&#x27;s idea to record &quot;The Beta Band&quot; in Maclean&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s hut was so they could record the sounds of the ocean for these pieces, and during which they discussed the possibility of a quadruple album. After the band returned to London, they had with them several hours of audio that they had recorded, which were then edited down into the two tracks.

According to Craig McLean of &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;both sounded a little random, like a radio scanning across the ether&quot;. However, the band ultimately decided to remove these tracks from the album. Jones recalled: &quot;We liked some of what we recorded, but it&#x27;s not really what we wanted it to be from start to finish. We felt the second part was lacking in direction.&quot; Nonetheless, this decision came several weeks after the band&#x27;s record label had already included the ambient disc with promotional copies of the album distributed to various people in the music industry. Drummer Robin Jones felt the reason they dropped the disc was because they were rushed into constructing it in only four days, saying they intended it to be &quot;an ambient… sound-piece. It’s really indulgent on our part, but I wanted to make it a musical story. In the same way &quot;Chill Out&quot; by The KLF is a story. So it sort of succeeds. It just needed more… conclusions. Rushed again.&quot; The bonus disc was eventually released officially alongside special editions of the album&#x27;s 2018 remaster.

==Composition==
===Musical style===
&quot;The Beta Band&quot; is an experimental, sonically complex, dense and detailed album. Unlike the band&#x27;s previous EPs, which presented their varied genre influences in a less coarse way, the album is more abstract and beat-minded, fusing genres more abrasively, whilst being less influenced by folk music. Described by AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny as &quot;a brashly schizophrenic freak-out which weaves its way throughout the history of rock &amp; roll,&quot; the album crosses a wide variety of musical ground which, in the words of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;, makes it &quot;hard to locate exactly where the foursome are coming from.&quot; Ankeny, describing the styles, said: &quot;Pop, blues, folk, psychedelia, hip-hop -- they&#x27;re all here, sometimes even colliding within the same song; the disc somehow sounds almost completely different with each successive listen, consistently revealing new layers and possibilities.”

The ten songs on the album rely on a snippet of melody, often sung and played on acoustic guitar by Steve Mason, but surrounding his voice are not only guitars or drums but many other, more unusual instruments and techniques, including samples, xylophones, sleigh bells, hand claps, spoons, and a diversity of bird whistles, including a cuckoo, with its songs integrating numerous tape loops and offbeat breakbeats into what writer Ron Hart called the album&#x27;s &quot;ambient classic rock jams and textured pop melodies&quot;. The music is said to disregard melody and other examples of musical theory such as verses and choruses in favour a chaotic approach. Jonathan Perry of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, describing the tracks, said:
As with prior albums, the band&#x27;s early Pink Floyd influence is prominent throughout &quot;The Beta Band&quot;, although hip hop is said to be a more prominent influence on this record, with rapping, splicing and samples appearing prominently. Mason hoped, regardless of the &quot;really obvious&quot; criss-cross of styles on &quot;The Beta Band Rap&quot;, the band&#x27;s various influences throughout the rest of &quot;The Beta Band&quot; would sound &quot;a bit more subtly involved&quot;. He also felt the record was both a conscious and natural effort, adding &quot;it&#x27;s just something we all really wanted to do&quot;, while Greentree himself described the album as &quot;like a bird without all the fleshy bits and feathers.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;″s Derek Miller called the album a &quot;testimony to balls-out astral tribalism&quot; which features &quot;some of the more singular &#x27;alt-pop music&#x27; of the last decade&quot;, while doing so &quot;in a veiled manner that never shows its hand until you’re four songs deep and still stuck in thought about the first.”

===Songs===
&quot;The Beta Band Rap&quot; opens the album and consists of three distinctive parts, opening with a spirited marching band introduction that segues into a rap section whose lyrics recount the band&#x27;s history to date in detail, describing the band&#x27;s formation, signing to Parlophone subsidiary label Regal Records and &quot;drinking champagne at EMI&quot;. It was described by writer Stuart Berman as &quot;actually equal parts barbershop-quartet serenade, proto-&#x27;Lazy Sunday&#x27; faux b-boy braggadocio, and Elvis pelvis thrusts.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s Not Too Beautiful&quot; follows, starting with pulsating guitars that push &quot;a wished whirlpool sound&quot; and followed by Mason&#x27;s multitracked vocals. According to one review, &quot;the song seems to take flight on the whirl of a helicopter, with blades blunted and made soft by the dander in the air.&quot; &quot;Simple Boy&quot; is a quieter song, backed by atmospheric changes.
Described as a country rock ramble, &quot;Round the Bend&quot; is among the more focused songs. Mason&#x27;s very specific lyrics are displayed as internal monologue as he recalls a disappointing night. He blends simple thoughts about drinking and dinner with travel fantasies about pyramids, opinions on the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Wild Honey&quot; and &quot;moments of deep awkwardness&quot;. A jam of both organic and electronic elements, &quot;Dance O&#x27;er the Border&quot; is heavy on repetition and percussion and lacks a melody for the first four minutes, while featuring lyrics that forgo verses, choruses and rhyming in favour of Mason spoken, stream-of-consciousness comments. Miles Bowe named it the album&#x27;s best song and the band&#x27;s fifth best overall, saying that although not &quot;very representative of the Beta Band&#x27;s sound&quot;, it &quot;does a pretty great job&quot; of anticipating LCD Soundsystem.

&quot;Brokenupadingdong&quot; and &quot;Smiling&quot; were compared to Julian Cope by writer Tom Ewing, who described them as &quot;ramshackle campfire clapalong jams with a powerful communal momentum&quot; that partly recall Amon Duul I, Can and late 1980s British house music. Between them is &quot;Number 15&quot;, a frustrated song with an emphasis on dance music and unusual choral refrains, alongside gamelan elements played with kitchen utensils. &quot;The Hard One&quot; was partly inspired by Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s 1983 hit &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;. The band sampled the piano motif from the song, and &quot;although [they] put it through stuff&quot;, they declared it &quot;their cover version&quot;; &quot;We switched the lyrics to the chorus around&quot;, Mason told &quot;CMJ&quot;, &quot;I thought that it was a great song, so we ended up writing a tune around it.&quot; Jim Steinman, who wrote and produced &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;, threatened the band with legal action over using its lyrics, &quot;Once upon a time I was falling in love, now I&#x27;m only falling apart&quot;, which the band changed slightly so that they became &quot;Once upon a time I was falling apart, now I&#x27;m only falling in love&quot;, but changed his mind after he heard the song. &quot;The Cow&#x27;s Wrong&quot; closes the record in a muted fashion.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;The Beta Band&quot; was highly anticipated, with &quot;Spin&quot; calling it &quot;one of the most anticipated releases in Britain since Oasis&#x27; &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;&quot;. Prior to release, &quot;The Beta Band&quot; was played before an invite-only industry audience in a studio/bar in Shoreditch, London, which included Noel Gallagher and Verve guitarist Nick McCabe. The band were in attendance, &quot;looking slightly embarrassed, like gate crashers at a party in their own home&quot;, according to Craig McLean. Gallagher praised the album when talking to an &quot;NME&quot; journalist. As the band told Lydia Vanderloo of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;, the band did not enjoy promoting the album. &quot;The Beta Band&quot; was released by Regal Records in the United Kingdom on 21 June 1999, and by Astralwerks in the United States on 29 June 1999. Astralwerks also released &quot;Round the Bend&quot; and &quot;The Cow&#x27;s Song&quot; as a promotional cassette single in the US. Upon its release, &quot;The Beta Band&quot; debuted and peaked at number 18 on the UK Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for two weeks.

===Band denouncement===

A week prior to the album&#x27;s release, Steve Mason infamously denounced the album as &quot;fucking awful&quot;, adding that &quot;it&#x27;s definitely the worst record we&#x27;ve ever made and it&#x27;s probably one of the worst records that&#x27;ll come out this year.&quot; Speaking to &quot;NME&quot;, he said the album contained &quot;some terrible songs&quot;, opining that none of the album&#x27;s tracks were fully written or developed, dismissing them as &quot;[h]alf-written songs with jams in the middle.” Greentree felt the production should have been less muddy, while McLean noted that their apparent shortcomings were the band&#x27;s fault; however, the band also blamed Regal for their dissatisfaction with the final album, including the abandoning of the ambient disc, which they saw as having been incomplete, and for not providing them with enough time or money to work on the album satisfyingly.

The statements immediately caused tension between the band and their label; &quot;The Guardian&quot; quoted &quot;an enraged EMI chairman&quot; as demanding to know &quot;what the fuck is going on with the Beta Band?&quot; The newspaper said the band &quot;began a public slagging match with their record company.&quot; Miles Leonard, boss of Regal and the band&#x27;s manager, dismissed their complaints, calling them &quot;lame excuses&quot; as &quot;they had as much time as they wanted to have to make it, they were not forced to do anything they didn&#x27;t want to.&quot; However, he did admit that some of the financial constraints led him to prevent the band&#x27;s continental recording idea, but felt the album was &quot;nowhere near as bad as they say&quot;, despite feeling it could have better. By the time of follow-up album &quot;Hot Shots II&quot; (2001), the band&#x27;s opinion on &quot;The Beta Band&quot; had not changed and spoke out against it being mentioned to them in interviews, with Greentree adding: &quot;We just never felt the album was properly finished.&quot; Mason later said, &quot;I sometimes wonder how that album would have been received if I&#x27;d kept my mouth shut.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Beta Band&quot; was less well received by music critics than the Beta Band&#x27;s previous releases. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Stuart Berman, the album &quot;deflated the ballooning expectations surrounding the group in the wake of &quot;The Three EPs&quot; with all the elegance and subtlety of a whoopee cushion.&quot; While many critics praised the band&#x27;s ambitions, the album was also concurrently criticised as overstuffed and messy. In a retrospective piece, Derek Miller of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; disagreed that it was messy, saying it was &quot;brave and cohesive&quot;, and noted how &quot;they manage to somehow form a whole out of shattered, uneven pieces. It&#x27;s awkward, Dalian, almost completely disinterested in closing the circle, and that’s the beauty in its madness.&quot;

Among original reviews, Brent DiCrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; hailed &quot;The Beta Band&quot; as a unique sounding album that was &quot;so psychedelic, yet not excessively experimental.&quot; Ron Hart, writing for &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot;, was favourable, praising the album and how it turned &quot;experimental dabblings&quot; into a &quot;fully realised concept&quot;. Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the band &quot;layer warped voices, pastoral guitars and random sound effects over slow-motion loops to evoke a chance meeting between King Crimson circa 1969 and Happy Mondays circa 1989&quot;, highlighting &quot;The Cow&#x27;s Wrong&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album a three-star honourable mention rating, signifying &quot;an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure.&quot; He stated that the band is &quot;still lost in sound, but oriented enough here to make tunes out of it.&quot;

Writing several months after the release of &quot;The Beta Band&quot;, Tom Ewing of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; called it &quot;the most troublesome album of 1999,&quot; highlighting how &quot;its makers disown it, its few disciples adore it, a whole lot of people hate it, and a whole lot more like me just don&#x27;t know what to make of it, but keep playing it anyway. While there are certainly good bits and bad bits on &quot;The Beta Band&quot;, it’s not always possible to work out which is which, let alone pull them apart. And the funny thing is that after a few months you stop caring and just take the whole damn lot as it comes.&quot;

At the end of 1999, &quot;The Beta Band&quot; was ranked in several publications&#x27; lists of the year&#x27;s best albums; &quot;Intro&quot; named it 9th, &quot;Mojo&quot; named it the 10th, &quot;Rockdelux&quot; named it the 26th, &quot;Muzik&quot; named it the 27th, and &quot;NME&quot; named it the 36th. In a retrospective review, AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny thought that the album &quot;constantly runs the risk of collapsing into complete self-indulgence.&quot; Nevertheless, Ankeny further stated: &quot; In its way the Beta Band&#x27;s genius is their wanton disregard for niceties like verses, choruses, and melodies; rejecting musical theory in favor of the chaos theory, the album&#x27;s neither a masterpiece nor a mess, but both.&quot; Miles Bowe of &quot;Stereogum&quot; have conceded no less that &quot;everyone knew that the record was rushed, and that maybe the band didn’t have enough time to fully develop the songs or lyrics as much,&quot; while also noting that &quot;people tend to forget that &quot;The Beta Band&quot; is not &#x27;fucking awful&#x27; — it’s actually pretty fucking great.&quot;

==Legacy==

In retrospect, &quot;The Beta Band&quot; has been re-assessed by some critics and considered underrated.
Writing in 2005, Jess Harvell of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; felt the band were neglected by critics and said &quot;there&#x27;s not a single band in the past year with the balls– or lack of sense, your call– to release a debut album as overgrown with ideas (not always good ones, mind you) as &quot;The Beta Band&quot;.&quot; Stuart Berman, also of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, described &quot;The Beta Band&quot; as the group&#x27;s most notorious release and felt it was the last known example of a &quot;group this strange&quot; signing to a major label and then using their new label to make even stranger music, especially when considering the abandoned ambient bonus disc. &quot;If the record violently vascillates between fascinating and frustrating on a song-by-song basis,&quot; he said, &quot;its over-arching oddness retains its own peculiar allure.&quot;

Derek Miller of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; said that by the time the band split up in 2004, &quot;The Beta Band&quot; was widely considered to be &quot;unnecessarily difficult, a short side-step in the career of a remarkably talented band&quot;, but he felt the album had been long underrated and was due for re-evaluation, praising its unique sound and adding that it &quot;remains the broken-toothed step-child with a little bit of dander on the lip and a tangle of hair on its back, but Christ those eyes, so keen and full of mischief, forgive the ugly parts.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; founder Ryan Schreiber called &quot;The Beta Band&quot; &quot;the greatest acid-burnt full-length of the late 90s&quot;, saying that although it &quot;took some getting used to, since half of its songs were, to put it gently, cracked&quot;, the &quot;densely layered electronic psychedelia&quot; songs proved the band as &quot;one of the few modern electronic-based bands capable of successfully splicing hundreds of self-created sources into huge, pastoral symphonies, grounded in both pop music and Dalí surrealism.&quot; The album is featured in &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The Mojo Collection&quot;, which lists what its authors consider to be the 1,000 greatest albums of all time.

<text>DJ Cheese (born Robert Cheese) is a disc jockey and record producer who won the 1986 DMC World Final in London, showcasing the art of scratching in turntablism for the first time. He also appeared in the 1986 UK tour with Run-DMC. He is known as ‘master of the crossfader’.

==Early life==
Cheese was born in Oak Hill, West Virginia. He lived in Edison, New Jersey from birth and later moved to Plainfield in 1977. In 1980, Cheese would become inspired by Grandmaster Flash and begin to develop an interest for hip hop and purchasing and collecting official DJ equipment.

==Career==
In 1984, DJ Cheese won the DJ Battle for World Supremacy at the New Music Seminar, becoming the first non-NYC DJ to win the title. At the seminar, Cheese met and joined Tony Prince in competition. Cheese was later invited by Tony Prince to appear in the inaugural DMC DJ World Championship. Cheese&#x27;s portion of the competition incorporated scratching, which initiated a different approach to deejay battling and changed the course of DMC competitions moving forward.

From 1985-1986, under the label Profile Records, Cheese released two vinyl 12&quot; singles with the group Word Of Mouth entitled &#x27;Coast to Coast&#x27; and &#x27;King Kut&#x27;. King Kut would be used in the coming years as a way of &quot;basing songs around how great your deejay is.&quot;

In 1986, Cheese headlined both performances (afternoon/evening) at the London’s &quot;UK Fresh ’86&quot; show at the Wembley Arena. It was during these performances that DJ Cheese performed his set along with KMC and MC Original G from Word of Mouth. Later that year Cheese would collaborate with Fats Comet on the song &#x27;Eat The Beat&#x27;.

After this, Cheese distanced himself from Word of Mouth due to a financial dispute with Profile Records. Since then, he has spent periods of involvement in music, performing with Doug E. Fresh, Slick Rick, Big Daddy Kane, and 50 Cent. In 2013, he reconnected with Word of Mouth to record the single &quot;Life Without Hip Hop&quot;.

<text>William Robert Webb (November 11, 1842December 19, 1926) also known as &quot;Sawney&quot; Webb, was an educator who founded the Webb School and served briefly as a Democratic United States Senator from Tennessee.

==Biography==
Webb was born near Mount Tirzah in Person County, North Carolina. He was the grandson of Richard Stanford, an early ten-term United States Representative from North Carolina. His father, Alexander Webb, died when he was six years old. He attended private schools, including the Bingham School in Oaks, North Carolina, and then matriculated at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1860. However, he soon left to join the Confederate Army in the Fifteenth North Carolina Infantry Regiment, in which he served until badly wounded at the Battle of Malvern Hill on July 1, 1862. While recovering from his wounds, he again attended UNC. In the spring of 1864, he re-enlisted as a private in the Second North Carolina Cavalry Regiment and had risen to the rank of Captain by the time of his capture on April 3, 1865, after the Battle of Namozine Church. He was imprisoned on Hart&#x27;s Island in western Long Island Sound and then transferred to Castle Williams on Governors Island in June, 1865, from which he escaped for a one-day adventure in the city. After the conclusion of the Civil War he returned to UNC, graduating in 1868 and subsequently teaching at Horner Military School in Oxford, North Carolina until 1870.

That year he moved to Tennessee and established The Webb School, a preparatory school in the small community of Culleoka. In 1886, after Culleoka incorporated and legalized the sale of liquor in the new city, he (being a prohibitionist) moved the Webb School to Bell Buckle, where it still exists today.

Webb married Emma Clary on April 23, 1873, and together they produced eight children: William Robert, Jr. (1874–1960), Alla (1875–1944), John Stanford (1877–1951), Adeline (1879–1968), Daniel Clary (1881–1954), Susan (1882–1980), Emma (1884–1973), and Thompson (1887–1975). His eldest son Will succeeded him as principal at the Webb School, and his youngest son Thompson founded the Webb School of California (now The Webb Schools) in Claremont in 1922.

He was elected to the United States Senate by the Tennessee General Assembly to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Robert Love Taylor and served from January 24 to March 3, 1913. He was the last Confederate soldier to do so. Always a prohibitionist, he delivered his one speech in the Senate to support a law prohibiting interstate transport of liquor. He then returned to Bell Buckle and his school, dying there in 1926 and being buried at Hazelwood Cemetery.

<doc id="1234760" wikidata="Q704616" url="?curid=1234760" title="Ramón Franco">
<text>Ramón Franco Bahamonde (2 February 1896 – 28 October 1938) was a Spanish pioneer of aviation, a political figure and brother of later caudillo Francisco Franco. Well before the Spanish Civil War, during the reign of Alfonso XIII, both brothers were acclaimed as national heroes in Spain; however, the two had strongly differing political views. They had a less-known brother, Nicolás, who was a military man like Francisco and Ramón, and also a politician. 

==Aviator==
Ramón started his career as an ordinary successful military officer in the infantry, assigned to Morocco in 1914. In 1920 he joined the Spanish Air Force, participating in activities that earned him international attention. Promoted major, in 1926 he became a national hero when he piloted the &quot;Plus Ultra&quot; flying boat on a transatlantic flight. His co-pilot was Julio Ruiz de Alda Miqueleiz; the other crew members were Teniente de Navio (Navy Lieutenant) Juan Manuel Duran and the mechanic Pablo Rada. The &quot;Plus Ultra&quot; departed from Palos de la Frontera, in Huelva, Spain on 22 January and arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 26 January. It stopped over at Gran Canaria, Cape Verde, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo. The 10,270 km journey was completed in 59 hours and 39 minutes.

The event appeared in most of the major newspapers worldwide. Throughout the Spanish-speaking world the Spanish aviators were glamorously acclaimed, particularly in Argentina and Spain where thousands gathered at Plaza de Colón in Madrid. 

In 1929, he attempted another trans-Atlantic flight, this time crashing the airplane to the sea. The crew was rescued days later by HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;, an aircraft carrier of the British Royal Navy.

==Political activism==
During the reign of Miguel Primo de Rivera he declared himself on several occasions against the regime. He conspired against the Monarchy, inflicted losses on the army and was sent to prison, from which he was able to escape. In December 1930, along with other Republican aviators, he seized some aircraft at the aerodrome of Cuatro Vientos and flew over Madrid dropping leaflets which falsely stated a republican revolution had broken out all over Spain, calling on citizens and soldiers to aid the movement and stating that troops&#x27; quarters would be bombed shortly if they did not help in the revolution. He fled to Portugal and returned to Spain when the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed.

Reentering the Army, in April 1931 he was named chief of a main directorate of Aeronautics. His tenure lasted 2 months; in June 1931 he was dismissed in wake of a Tablada affair, an unclear episode which gave rise to suspicion that Franco was involved in a revolutionary plot in Andalusia. He was elected as a deputy in the Cortes for Republican Left of Catalonia in Barcelona, retiring from the army and focused on politics.

==Civil War==
When the Spanish Civil War exploded in July 1936, he was in the United States as an air attaché of the Spanish Embassy.

Upon his return to Spain, in spite of his leftist political past, he joined the Nationalist side of which his brother Francisco was a main leader. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was named head of the airbase at Majorca. His receipt of the command in Majorca was &quot;received very badly&quot; by his fellow aviators, who resented that Ramón, a Freemason who had been dismissed, had been promoted over officers with war merits.

==Death==
Ramón Franco was killed in an air accident on 28 October 1938, when his seaplane, a CANT Z.506, crashed off Pollença, near the coast of Majorca, while attempting to bomb Republican-controlled Valencia. His body was found floating in the water, and his death led to rumours of conspiracies and sabotage. According to his sister, he was murdered by Freemasons who loaded bricks and mortar aboard his plane because he wanted to publish an anti-Masonic book called &quot;La burla del grado 33&quot;. After the crash, his brother Francisco, who would rule Spain for the next three decades, severed most relations with his brother&#x27;s widow and daughter.

<text>The Romanian Athenaeum () is a concert hall in the center of Bucharest, Romania, and a landmark of the Romanian capital city. Opened in 1888, the ornate, domed, circular building is the city&#x27;s most prestigious concert hall and home of the &quot;George Enescu&quot; Philharmonic and of the George Enescu Festival.

== History ==
In 1865, cultural and scientific personalities such as Constantin Esarcu, V. A. Urechia, and Nicolae Crețulescu founded the Romanian Athenaeum Cultural Society. To serve its purposes, the Romanian Athenaeum, a building dedicated to art and science, would be erected in Bucharest.

The building was designed by the French architect Albert Galleron, built on a property that had belonged to the Văcărescu family and inaugurated in 1888, although work continued until 1897. A portion of the construction funds was raised by public subscription in a 28-year-long effort, of which the slogan is still remembered today: &quot;Donate one &quot;leu&quot; for the &quot;Ateneu&quot;!&quot; (Romanian &quot;Dați un leu pentru Ateneu!&quot;).

On December 29, 1919, the Athenaeum was the site of the conference of leading Romanians who voted to ratify the unification of Bessarabia, Transylvania, and Bukovina with the Romanian Old Kingdom to constitute Greater Romania.

Extensive reconstruction and restoration work has been conducted in 1992 by a Romanian construction company and restoration painter Silviu Petrescu, saving the building from collapse. The nine million Euro required were contributed in equal shares by the government and the Council of Europe Development Bank.

== Building and facilities ==
The overall style is neoclassical, with some more romantic touches. In front of the building there is a small park and a statue of Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu.

Inside, the ground floor hosts an ornate conference hall as large as the auditorium above; in the auditorium there are 600 seats in the stalls, the rest of the seats being placed in 52 loges.

A fresco by Costin Petrescu decorates the inside of the circular wall of the concert hall. Painted using the &quot;al fresco&quot; technique, the piece depicts the most important moments of Romanian history, starting with the conquest of Dacia by Roman emperor Trajan and ending with the realization of Greater Romania in 1918.

Recognized as a symbol of Romanian culture, the building has been inscribed in 2007 on the list of the Label of European Heritage sites.

<text>Wych Kaosayananda (; born 1974), also known as Wych Kaos or Kaos, is a Thai film director.

== Early life ==
The son of Thai diplomat Kaosayananda, he lived and studied in Pakistan, where his father was posted in Islamabad as an ambassador.

== Career ==
His directorial debut was &quot;Fah&quot;, released in 1998, which at the time was the highest-budgeted film in the history of the Thai film industry, but failed in the Thai box office.

His second film and American debut (which he directed under the shortened name &quot;Kaos&quot;) was the 2002 thriller &quot;&quot;, which upon release was widely panned by both critics and moviegoers as one of the worst films ever made. In March 2007, Rotten Tomatoes ranked the film number 1 among &quot;The Worst of the Worst&quot; movie list.

Kaosayananda&#x27;s post-&quot;Ballistic&quot; films include &quot;Tekken 2: Kazuya&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (2014), &quot;&quot;Zero Tolerance&quot;&quot; (2015) and &quot;One Night in Bangkok&quot; (2020).

&quot;Zero Tolerance&quot; was previously completed and released only in Vietnam under the title of &quot;Angels&quot;. Kaosayananda found it difficult to sell his film to distributors because &quot;Angels&quot; was more of a drama than an action film. Therefore, he decided to add action star Scott Adkins into the mix for marquee value and to re-shoot and re-edit the entire film in order to craft more of a streamlined actioner that would interest buyers. This re-edited version, entitled &quot;Zero Tolerance&quot;, is the cut of the film that has been released to the rest of the world.

&quot;Dead Earth&quot; tells a parallel story to Kaosayananda&#x27;s &quot;The Driver&quot;, focusing on events that happen within the same post-apocalyptic world, with characters and locations intersecting between both films.

<text>John Albert Thompson (born Jon Torsteinsson Rue; April 30, 1827 – May 15, 1876), nicknamed Snowshoe Thompson, an early resident of the Sierra Nevada of Nevada and California, was a Norwegian-American considered to be the father of California skiing.

==Background==
Jon Torsteinsson Rue was born on the Rue farm in Austbygdi, Tinn in Telemark, Norway. He was the son of Torsten Olsen Rue (ca. 1760–1829) and Gro Jonsdatter Håkaland (1781-ca. 1846). His father died when Thompson was 2 years old.

In 1837, at the age of 10, Thompson came to America with his mother, settling first on a farm in Norway, LaSalle County, Illinois at the Fox River Settlement. The family subsequently moved on the Norwegian immigrant settlement in Shelby County, Missouri which was under the leadership of Cleng Peerson.
In 1839, they were joined by Thompson&#x27;s brother Tostein (1819-1880) and sister Kari (born 1822). In 1840, they followed Hans Barlien and moved to the Sugar Creek Settlement in Lee County, Iowa.

In 1846, Thompson and his brother Tostein came to Dane County, Wisconsin. In 1851, Thompson drove a herd of milk cows to California and settled in Placerville. For a short while he mined in Kelsey Diggins, Coon Hollow and Georgetown. With the small amount he saved, he bought a small ranch at Putah Creek, in the Sacramento Valley. In 1860, Thompson homesteaded a 160-acre ranch in Diamond Valley, south of Genoa in California&#x27;s Alpine County.

==Mail delivery==
Between 1856 and 1876, he delivered mail between Placerville, California and Genoa, Nevada and later Virginia City, Nevada. Despite his nickname, he did not make use of the snowshoes that are native to North America, but rather would travel with what the local people applied that term to: ten-foot (over 3-meter) skis, and a single sturdy pole generally held in both hands at once. He knew this version of cross-country skiing from his native Norway, and employed it during the winter as one of the earlier pioneers of backcountry skiing in the United States. Thompson delivered the first silver ore to be mined from the Comstock Lode. Later he taught others how to make skis, as well as the basics of their use. Despite his twenty years of service as a subcontractor, he was never paid for delivering the mail.

Thompson typically made the eastward trip in three days, and the return trip in two days. Thompson carried no blanket and no gun; he claimed he was never lost even in blizzards. A rescue attributed to him was that of a man trapped in his cabin by unusually deep snow. Thompson reached him, realized the damage to the man&#x27;s legs from frostbite was sufficient to kill him, skied out to get chloroform, skied back in with it, and delivered the chloroform in time to save him.

Thompson traveled the Star routes along Old Emigrant Road and later Big Tree Route. The route known as &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Cutoff&quot; was a pathway first marked by John Calhoun Johnson, an early explorer and first man to deliver mail over the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Today this approximates the route of U.S. Route 50 as it winds its way from Placerville, California to South Lake Tahoe.

==Personal life==
In 1866, Thompson married Agnes Singleton (1831-1915) who had come to America from England. The Thompsons&#x27; only child, Arthur Thomas, was born on February 11, 1867. From 1868 to 1872 Thompson served on the Board of Supervisors of Alpine County, and was a delegate to the Republican State Convention in Sacramento in 1871. In spite of a resolution sent to Washington, D.C. by the Nevada Legislature, the many political contacts he had gathered, and a trip to Washington, D.C. in 1872, Snowshoe Thompson was never paid for his services delivering the United States Mail.

Snowshoe Thompson died of appendicitis which developed into pneumonia on May 15, 1876. His grave can be seen in Genoa, Nevada, in Carson Valley, east of Lake Tahoe. His son, Arthur, died two years later of diphtheria, and was buried next to his father at the cemetery in Genoa.

==Legacy==
*In 1885, a marble stone was erected on the site of Snowshoe&#x27;s grave. Engraved are a pair of crossed skis and the phrase &quot;Gone but not forgotten.&quot;

*In 2001, a statue of Snowshoe Thompson was erected on the grounds of the Mormon Station State Historic Park in Genoa, Nevada.

*Monuments to the memory of Snowshoe Thompson can also be found at Carson Pass, Boreal Ski Resort, Palisades Tahoe and Carthay Circle, Los Angeles.

*A memorial stone in Austbygdi, Telemark in Norway where he was born.
*Thompson Peak is a 9,340-ft summit in the Sierra Nevada that is named for him.

==Thompson in popular culture==
*In 1954, the character actor Don Kennedy (born 1920) played Thompson in an episode of the syndicated western anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days,&quot; hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Thompson comes to the aid of Sierra Nevada miners in Placerville and other mining camps to carry the U. S. mail in snowy winters. Despite his enthusiasm for the job, he was never compensated. The lack of funds caused a delay into his planned marriage to Agnes (Jane Hampton).
*Country and folk singer Johnny Horton in 1956 recorded &quot;Snowshoe Thompson&quot;, a song about Thompson&#x27;s adventures as a mail carrier. The song is track 4 on the compilation: &quot;Johnny Horton Makes History&quot;.
*Scottish rocker Alex Harvey covered the song on his posthumous 1982 release, Soldier On The Wall.
*In 2008 Norwegian author Terje Nordberg wrote a Donald Duck comic strip (&quot;Donald Duck &amp; Co&quot;), which Norwegian artist Arild Midthun illustrated. The title &quot;Snowshoe Duckson&quot; makes an obvious reference.
*In 2020, Colorado band Wildfire Stampout recorded “Snowshoe” on their album “Stampout Songstravaganza”. The song is based on Snowshoe Thompson&#x27;s reliability during his cross-mountain deliveries.

<doc id="1234795" wikidata="Q7611207" url="?curid=1234795" title="Stereo Type A">
<text>Stereo Type A (stylized as Stereo ★ Type A) is the second studio album by Cibo Matto released in 1999. As the group disbanded in 2001, it was their last studio album prior to their 2011 reunion. The album peaked at number 171 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and also reached the top spot of &quot;CMJ&quot;″s College charts.

==Background==
While having a strong focus on atmospheric and ambient sounds and melody (particularly in &quot;Moonchild&quot;), &quot;Stereo Type A&quot; also contains a broad range of styles, reaching into hip hop territory on &quot;Sci-Fi Wasabi&quot; (with additional vocals by Duma Love), and heavy metal on &quot;Blue Train&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;Clouds&quot; and &quot;Mortming&quot; contain heavily vocoded vocals.

In their interview with the band, Barnes &amp; Noble noted the band moving away from writing songs about food, opining the album is a &quot;diverse collection of tracks that includes metal-edged rockers, lounge-influenced pop, pithy hip-hop -- and only one song about culinary delicacies (&#x27;Sci-Fi Wasabi&#x27;).&quot; In the same interview, Yuka spoke about the album&#x27;s title:

When we decided to make this record, Miho and I talked about a lot of things that were on our minds: what was happening around us and how we felt about what happened with [the perception of] &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot;. For three days we were just sitting around talking and talking instead of writing music. And we kept bumping into that subject a lot: how we have to deal with stereotypes so much, and how it can be very hard, because the people who have these stereotypes aren&#x27;t even aware of it.

==Critical reception==
Several critics noted the album&#x27;s difference from the group&#x27;s debut, regarding it positively as a progression of style and a maturation. The album received positive reviews upon its release, with &quot;Melody Maker&quot; calling it &quot;album of the year so far. Purely joyous pop.&quot; &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine also named it &quot;pure pop LP of the year so far.&quot;

Heather Phares of AllMusic says of the album: &quot;Relying less on samples and more on their latent funk and jazz elements, &quot;Stereotype A&quot; sounds like summer in New York -- eclectic, hot, and funky. ...&quot;Stereotype A&quot;″s overall sound is more direct and less fanciful than of their debut album &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot;.&quot; Independent publication &quot;SOMA Magazine&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;Stereotype A&quot; confirms that the best way to make pop music is by combining multiple styles... Combined with Yuka Honda&#x27;s style for sampling and Miho&#x27;s sensual vocals, &quot;Stereotype A&quot; is a complete success.&quot;

<text>Fewell is a Scottish name derived from a word for &quot;people&quot;. It has been a family name since the late 5th century, though the Saxon invasions mixed the native Scottish bloodline with conquering noblemen in 1200. The line that was therefore created in Scotland extended later into Western Europe and eventually into the Americas.

One line of the Fewell family became wealthy through seafaring trade in the southern Scottish ports. The family gained repute because they guaranteed protection for the merchants that traveled through their ports. The wealth was lost when that family migrated to the United States during the 1820s. Another branch of the Fewell family may have emigrated to Virginia as early as 1656; US Census records this branch in Faquier County, Virginia, in the 1790 census and every succeeding census although the only males in this line who have living male descendants bearing the name Fewell removed to Washington, DC in the early 20th century and their descendants are to be found in the early 21st century to New York.

Fewell is also a family name of Austrian origin, derived from &quot;fuer&quot; or its variants and anglicized upon immigration to the United States.

People named Fewell include:

*John Fewell, English Member of Parliament
*Perry Fewell (born 1962), American collegiate and National Football League coach
*Stephen Fewell, British actor
*Billy Bowlegs III or Billy Fewell (1862–1965), Seminole elder</text><links>

<doc id="1234808" wikidata="Q1757555" url="?curid=1234808" title="Viva! La Woman">
<text>Viva! La Woman is the debut studio album by the band Cibo Matto, released on January 16, 1996, by Warner Bros. Records.

The tracks &quot;Birthday Cake&quot; and &quot;Know Your Chicken&quot; were first released as singles in 1995. Following the release of &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot;, the latter was reissued as a single in July 1996. Music videos were produced for &quot;Know Your Chicken&quot; and &quot;Sugar Water&quot;, directed by Evan Bernard and Michel Gondry, respectively.

==Background==
Warner Bros. Records signed Cibo Matto after the band&#x27;s self-titled EP caught the label&#x27;s attention. The tracks on &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot;, Cibo Matto&#x27;s first album for the label, reflected the band&#x27;s live performances, utilizing pre-recorded samples and loops. Cibo Matto instrumentalist Yuka Honda has expressed regret that she did not stand up for herself when others discouraged her from replacing the samples and loops with new recordings.

==Composition==
&quot;Stereogum&quot;″s James Rettig classifies &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot; as a trip hop album. Throughout the album, vocalist Miho Hatori&#x27;s alternately sung, rapped, and whispered performances are backed by Yuka Honda&#x27;s hip hop-inspired sound collages. &quot;New York&quot; writer Chris Norris described Hatori and Honda as avant-pop musicians who on &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot; &quot;weave found sounds, Muzak, and orchestral textures&quot; into &quot;atmospheric&quot; songs. In &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, critic Rob Sheffield described the music as a mixture of hip hop, dub, lounge, and pop.

The album&#x27;s lyrics balance humorous themes in &quot;Beef Jerky&quot;, &quot;Birthday Cake&quot;, and &quot;Know Your Chicken&quot; with abstract, often emotional narrative-style wording in &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Sugar Water&quot;, and &quot;Artichoke&quot;, as well as overall pop music fare in &quot;White Pepper Ice Cream&quot;, &quot;Theme&quot;, and &quot;Le Pain Perdu&quot;. Several songs feature the group&#x27;s well-known references to food, primarily present on this release. Honda explained: &quot;Food is something you can&#x27;t escape. It&#x27;s there every day.&quot; The band would often go to restaurants after rehearsals, and according to Honda, &quot;Cibo Matto grew out of those restaurant times.&quot;

&quot;Theme&quot;, unusual among Cibo Matto&#x27;s discography for its length, is a track which features a relatively normal song sung in English with several Italian words before shifting into instrumental passages and leading into a second half that contains entire verses in Japanese and French.

==Packaging==
The album booklet contains illustrations and lyrics accompanying most of the songs. The only tracks for which the booklet features no lyrics are &quot;The Candy Man&quot;, a cover of a song from the 1971 film &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; (presumably for copyright reasons; the song also has all lyrical references to Willy Wonka changed to &quot;the candy man&quot;), and &quot;Jive&quot;, an 18-second hidden track primarily consisting of a recording of Miho Hatori tapping her thighs, for which she is also credited.

==Reception==
&quot;Viva! La Woman&quot; was acclaimed by music critics. Michele Romero of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described Cibo Matto as &quot;sonic savants who go nutty mixing disparate ingredients, like avant-garde trumpet with bossa nova bass lines and sugary non-sequitur lyrics&quot;, summarizing the album as &quot;kitschy club music, as kooky and lovable as Hello Kitty.&quot; &quot;Select&quot; writer Andrew Male remarked on the album&#x27;s playful lyrics, while noting that the band is &quot;far more musically adept than yer average guitar &#x27;n&#x27; shouting comedy act.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Caroline Sullivan called &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot; &quot;an ambitious confection of trickling beats and delicately comatose spoken vocals whose only hint of wackiness is the lyrics&quot;, while AllMusic&#x27;s Heather Phares praised it as &quot;innovative and catchy&quot; and &quot;diverse and entertaining&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; named &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot; the tenth best album of 1996 and later ranked it as the 90th best album of the 1990s. The album spent six weeks at number one on CMJ&#x27;s college radio charts. Some listeners perceived the album as a novelty, &quot;partly because of the cutesy-pie assumptions attached to Asian women in pop and partly because of the band&#x27;s propensity for writing songs about food&quot;, much to Cibo Matto&#x27;s chagrin.

===Legacy and impact===

Writing in &quot;The Quietus&quot; in 2014, Joe Sweeney regarded &quot;Viva! La Woman&quot; as &quot;a food-obsessed avant-rap record that dared to be ridiculous at a time when full-throated earnestness... was shipping millions.&quot;

&quot;Viva!&quot; has been recognized as influential in the years since its release. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; positively discussed its impact within the history of Shibuya-kei music in a 2018 article. The site&#x27;s Samuel Rosean credited the album with bringing western listeners&#x27; attention to the sound, deeming it &quot;one of the genre&#x27;s first big international crossover moments&quot;. He praised &quot;Viva!&quot; as &quot;a masterstroke of progressive electronic sounds&quot; and called the band&#x27;s &quot;abstract&quot; fusion of Shibuya-kei with art pop and trip hop &quot;artful and forward-thinking&quot;.

<doc id="1234814" wikidata="Q588198" url="?curid=1234814" title="Antirrio">
<text>Antirrio (, pronounced , ) is a town and a former municipality in Aetolia-Acarnania, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Nafpaktia, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 50.794 km2. 

It is situated on the north side of the narrow (2.4 km) Strait of Rio, which separates the Gulf of Patras in the west from the Gulf of Corinth in the east. Since August 2004 the Rio–Antirrio bridge connects northwestern Greece with the Peloponnese. The name Antirrio means &quot;opposite Rio&quot;. 

==Subdivisions==
The municipal unit Antirrio is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):
*Antirrio (Antirrio, Karaoulia, Myrtia, Spartorachi)
*Makyneia (Makyneia, Agios Polykarpos, Agrapidokampos, Riza)
*Molykreio (Molykreio, Ano Platanitis, Fragkaiika)

==Historical population==

==Geography==
Antirrio is situated at the western entrance of the Gulf of Corinth. It is 3 km northwest of Rio, 10 km north of Patras and 9 km southwest of Naupactus. 8 km to the northwest is the 1,039 m high mountain Klokova (also known as &quot;Paliovouna&quot;), rising steeply from the Gulf of Patras coast. The Rio–Antirrio bridge, carrying Motorway 5, connects it with the Peloponnese peninsula. Greek National Road 5 connects it with Missolonghi and northwestern Greece, Greek National Road 48 with Naupactus and Livadeia.

==The port of Antirrio==

The Port of Antirrio is served by ferries that carry traffic between the Peloponnese and northwestern Greece. Its significance has decreased since the opening of the Rio-Antirrio bridge in 2004. It is still in use as a ferry port for hazardous cargo and by users attracted by the scenic route or the lower fare for crossing the Rio-Antirrio strait. Adjacent to the port there is a lighthouse and the Castle of Antirrio.

On the eastern pier of Antirrio port there is the Antirrio RTS (Regional Traffic Service) which is part of the national Vessel traffic service system of Greece (Officially called Vessel Traffic Management and Information System). The RTS of Antirrio includes a building with the necessary electronics/communication equipment and a sensors/radar mast of 20m height. On top of the mast there is a remotely controlled CCTV camera, VHF antennas and the antenna of the coastal surveillance and navigation radar GEM RT02-25D.

<text>Tolbachik () is a volcanic complex on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the far east of Russia. It consists of two volcanoes, Plosky (&quot;flat&quot;) Tolbachik (3,085 m) and Ostry (&quot;sharp&quot;) Tolbachik (3,672 m), which as the names suggest are respectively a flat-topped shield volcano and a peaked stratovolcano. As Ostry is the mountain&#x27;s highest point, the entire mountain is often referred to as &quot;Ostry Tolbachik&quot;, not to be confused with Ostry, a separate volcano to the north also on the Kamchatka Peninsula.

== Activity ==
Its eruptive history stretches back thousands of years, but the most notable eruption occurred in 1975, commonly known as &quot;The Great Tolbachik Fissure Eruption&quot;. It was preceded by an earthquake swarm, which led to a successful prediction of the eruption by scientists from the Russian Institute of Volcanology. The eruption created several new cinder cones, and in terms of volume of lava emitted, was Kamchatka&#x27;s largest basaltic eruption in historic times.

On November 27, 2012 a strombolian type eruption started from two fissures. Basaltic lava flows move relatively fast, and quickly flooded buildings 4 km away. The eruption continued for more than a month, as lava continued to flow from the fissures. Lava flowed up to 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the line of fissures on the volcano&#x27;s southern flank. According to the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team, the eruption ended September 15, 2013. Several lava caves were formed as a result of the 2012–2013 eruption.

==Mineralogy==
The fumarole deposits of Tolbachik are rich in exotic minerals and, , 100 new minerals have been first described here including alarsite and tolbachite.

<text>Eastern Mountain Sports (or EMS) is an outdoor clothing and equipment retailer in the Northeastern United States headquartered in Meriden, Connecticut.

EMS sells outdoor equipment and clothing from both name brands and its own EMS line. The company also has a set of EMS Schools that offer classes in rock and ice climbing, kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding, trekking, and skiing. The EMS Schools headquarters is located in the White Mountains in North Conway, New Hampshire, and has other locations near the Adirondacks in New York, etc.

== History ==
EMS was founded in 1967 in Wellesley, Massachusetts by two camping enthusiasts, Alan McDonough, who was running the family hotel chain, and Roger Furst, a lawyer whose office was in the McDonough complex. They targeted the outdoor equipment market in Boston. The first store on Linden St. in Wellesley carried the Gerry outdoor equipment line as well as downhill skis.
In 1968, the two enterprises merged and built the 1041 Commonwealth Avenue store – at 10,000 sq. ft. McDonough and Furst sold the company in 1979 to The Franklin Mint, which was acquired by Warner Communications in 1981. Four years later Warner sold the Mint but retained EMS, subsequently selling it to the American Retail Group, owned by the Brenninkmeijer family.

In July 2003 Will Manzer became President and CEO and shifted the company focus back towards specialty outdoors gear. A new logo, store reorganization, and a shift from stores in shopping malls to freestanding community-based stores followed.

American Retail Group sold Eastern Mountain Sports to investors led by J.H. Whitney &amp; Company in 2004.

Bob Mayerson was announced as the new president in March 2010, as Will Manzer continued leading the company.

In 2012, Versa Capital Management bought EMS from J.H. Whitney and Mark Walsh became CEO. As of 2013, EMS operated over 70 stores throughout the Northeast US, from Maine to Virginia.

In April 2016, Vestis Retail Group, the Versa Capital-owned unit which owned the Sport Chalet and Bob&#x27;s Stores sporting goods chains as well as Eastern Mountain, announced it had filed for bankruptcy protection and reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Vestis said it would reorganize and focus on the operations of Eastern Mountain and Bob&#x27;s, while all Sport Chalet stores would close.

On 19 April 2017, Sports Direct International plc (Sports Direct) received permission to acquire Bob&#x27;s Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports following Eastern Outfitters LLC&#x27;s Chapter 11 filing.

In May 2022, Bob&#x27;s Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports was acquired by GoDigital Media Group as part of its strategy to generate synergy between content, community and commerce.

In June 2024, SDI Stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, marking Eastern Mountain Sports&#x27; third time in bankruptcy protection. The filing came after the company announced that up to 10 stores would close from both brands. SDI Stores owed millions of dollars in unpaid debt to many of its creditors. As a result of the bankruptcy, the Meriden warehouse will close and all future online ordering purchases will be directed to stores.

However, in July 2024, SDI Stores announced that it would permanently close all of its remaining Bob&#x27;s Stores and a select number of Eastern Mountain Sports locations, with liquidation sales beginning immediately after the announcement. Additional layoffs are also expected to occur by July 5. However, up to 24 Eastern Mountain Sports locations will remain open during the bankruptcy proceedings for now, with 15 Eastern Mountain Sports locations being listed as clearance stores.

On September 3, 2024, the chain was acquired by British Outdoor retailer Mountain Warehouse for $10 million. Mountain Warehouse plans to expand the company and open as many as 100 new stores over the next few years.

<doc id="1234822" wikidata="Q1536103" url="?curid=1234822" title="Battle of Lund">
<text>The Battle of Lund, part of the Scanian War, was fought on December 4, 1676, in an area north of the city of Lund in Scania in southern Sweden, between the invading Danish army and the army of Charles XI of Sweden. The Danish had an army of about 13,000 under the personal command of 31-year-old King Christian V of Denmark, aided by General Carl von Arensdorff. The Swedish army, which numbered about 8,000, was commanded by Field Marshal Simon Grundel-Helmfelt and the 21-year-old Swedish king Charles XI. It is one of the bloodiest battles in percent of casualties on both sides ever fought in Scandinavia.

==Events leading up to the battle==
After the Swedish defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin and a number of Danish triumphs at sea, the Swedish military was occupied retaining their tenuous hold on dominions in Brandenburg and Pomerania.

The Danes saw this as an opportunity to regain control over the Scanian lands, which had fallen to Sweden with the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde. The Danes invaded via Helsingborg in late June 1676 with an army of 14,000 men, where they found themselves supported by the local peasantry. This made it impossible for the outnumbered Swedish troops to effectively defend the recently acquired province. After a month, only the fortified town of Malmö remained under Swedish control.

In August, a Danish detachment tried to advance north, but Swedish King Charles XI had prepared a new army in the province of Småland, and the Danish advance was halted at the Battle of Halmstad. The Swedes had gathered 14,000 men by October, of which three-fourths were mounted, and felt confident enough to march south. They slowly fought their way in an attempt to break the siege of Malmö. Swedish supply lines were thin due to frequent interceptions by local peasants under the command of Danish officers.

In early November, the Danish king and his army had taken post at Lund, south of the Kävlinge River. The Danes controlled all the river crossings, and the Swedish army was forced to camp on the north side. For one month this situation endured, but snow arrived in late November, and the river surface began to freeze. On the morning of December 3, the Swedish General of Fortifications Erik Dahlberg reported to the king that the ice would hold their weight. The Danes assumed that the Swedes had gone into winter camp and that they would not attack until spring.

==Order of battle==
===Swedish forces===
Supreme Commander: Karl XI&lt;br&gt;
Commander in chief: Field Marshal Simon Grundel-Helmfelt&lt;br&gt;
Head of cavalry: General Rutger von Ascheberg&lt;br&gt;
Quartermaster general: Colonel Erik Jönsson Dahlberg.
===Unit sizes===
Squadron: 2 cavalry companies.&lt;br&gt;Battalion: 4 infantry companies.&lt;br&gt;Cavalry company: ca 75 riders.&lt;br&gt;Infantry company: ca 50 soldiers.&lt;br&gt;On average a squadron had 150 riders and a battalion 200 soldiers. Because of detachments, disease and desertions the units were rarely at full strength.

===Danish forces===
Supreme Commander: Kristian V&lt;br&gt;
Commander in chief: General Carl von Arensdorff 
==Battle==
Before daybreak the Swedish army broke camp and made preparations to cross the river. The Swedes had 2,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry at their disposal; their Danish opponents had more than 5,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, in addition to a few hundred Dutch sailors—in all, about 13,000 men. Under the cover of a moonless night, between 04:00 and 05:30, the entire Swedish force successfully crossed the river and reached the southern bank without alarming the Danes. The Swedes planned to attack the sleeping Danish camp with cavalry from the southeast. Reconnaissance patrols reported that the ground between the two armies was unsuitable for mounted troops, so King Charles XI and his generals gathered to discuss the new situation. Most advisers pointed out that it would be foolish to attack by foot as the Danish army possessed much more infantry and the Swedish main strength lay in its cavalry. Additionally, the Swedes would likely lose the element of surprise during the long march towards the Danish camp. The king was eager to attack at once, but was swayed by his advisers. He ordered the troops to advance towards the hills just outside the north wall of Lund, to seize a tactical advantage. The hills would mean better terrain for the cavalry and the town itself would cover the Swedish southern flank. By then the Danes had woken, and soon recognised the Swedish intentions. The Danes quickly broke camp and started to race the Swedes for control of the hills. The first skirmish was between the Swedish right wing and the Danish left wing, and ended in a draw. However, the hills were secured under Swedish control, and the Danes were pushed to the east.

The main battle began at 09:00, at sunrise. The front now stretched one kilometer from north to south, with the Danes to the east and the Swedes to the west. The Danish army was supported by 56 cannon of various calibers, while the Swedes brought only eight six-pounders and four three-pounders. Once the fighting commenced, Charles XI personally led a flanking maneuver to overwhelm the Danish left flank. During the fighting, the Danish commander Carl von Arensdorff was badly wounded, and the entire left wing was forced to retreat at 10:00, severely crippling the Danish army. von Arensdorff would later die from gangrene after amputation. Charles XI and Field Marshal Simon Grundel Helmfelt used their cavalry to pursue fleeing Danish troops and cut down any who lagged behind. The pursuit continued eight kilometers, right up to the river. Some officers at the Danish camp attempted to ward off the Swedes, but many Danes were forced onto the ice. The ice did not hold, and a great number of the remaining Danish left wing drowned.

While the Danish left wing fled, the right wing pushed the Swedes back until the Swedish left wing scattered with its commander lieutenant general Johan Galle killed. With the absence of Danish King Christian V and with General Arensdorff wounded, Friedrich von Arensdorff, the general&#x27;s brother, had assumed command of the Danish army. The Danish front was now facing south and the Swedish forces found themselves under constant attack with their backs against the town wall. The situation for the Swedes was desperate, as there had been no sign of the king, the Household cavalry, or the Field Marshal for hours. The Swedes were also greatly outnumbered, with approximately 1,400 infantry and 2,500 cavalry, as the Danes approximately counted 4,500 infantry and 2,100 cavalry. However, instead of forcing the attack, Friedrich von Arensdorff ordered the army to regroup at noon, halting the battle.

At the river, the Swedish king was contemplating his next move. Available intelligence from the town was scarce, and suggested that the whole Danish army was on the run. Although he was tempted to rout the fleeing Danish cavalry all the way to Landskrona, he decided to return to his army instead.

The battle at Lund renewed, and the Swedes were forced back once more. At sunset (about 15:00) the Swedish king returned from the north with his cavalry, combined with some cavalry units from the scattered Swedish left wing. He decided to try to circle the Danish army to the west to join the remains of the Swedish center. Danish commander Arensdorff made the decision to halt the offensive on the Swedish center and instead tend to the enemy cavalry in the northwest.

Charles XI, two generals, and three guards broke through the Danish lines to join the diminished Swedish center. While Arensdorff was still attacking the cavalry in the north, the return of the Swedish king inspired the exhausted troops, who attacked the Danish forces in the back. Though the Danes still outnumbered the Swedes, by approximately 4,500 to 4,000, Arensdorff had lost the initiative and after half an hour his army disintegrated. Charles XI wanted to clear the field of Danish soldiers. The remaining Danish cavalry quickly disappeared into the night. Although Danish General Siegwert von Bibow protected the infantry retreat, many of the Danes were massacred until Field Marshal Helmfelt ordered the killing to stop and the surrendering Danish soldiers were spared. At 17:00 a ceasefire was sounded.

==Aftermath==
Although the bodies were counted the next day, the original notes have been lost and the exact death toll is unknown. Contemporary Swedish sources indicate that between 8,300 and 9,000 were buried, excluding the Danes that drowned and soldiers that died from their wounds over the following weeks; however, it is likely that the peasants burying the bodies inflated the reported numbers for economic reasons, as suggested by author Gustaf Björlin, or that they include soldiers that had died of sickness and other reasons prior to the battle. One contemporary Danish source talks about a total of 9,300 dead. More realistically, the total deaths on the battlefield amounted to between 3,000 and 4,000 men, of which about 1,000 or slightly more were Swedes. The Swedes also had 2,000 men severely wounded after the battle, and perhaps 500 or so lightly wounded. According to Danish sources, their army had but 5,000 combat-ready men after the battle. Swedish sources, on the other hand, estimates that only 400 infantry and 2,500 Danish cavalry made it out unharmed; this number does not include artillery personnel or officers. At least 1,500 Danes had been captured and another 500 or so had been dispersed (of which many were subsequently killed or captured). The Dutch sailors had been exceptionally unfortunate; according to various sources, only a few dozen out of the 1,300 survived. The battle severely crippled both armies, seeing as it was extremely bloody when taking into consideration the casualties in comparison to the total number of combatants.

The Swedish victory is often attributed to the composition of their army, as it contained far fewer mercenaries than the Danish army. The Swedish mix of cavalry and infantry made it possible for the Swedes to mount swift counterattacks as soon as a friendly infantry unit buckled. The Danish still used the caracole tactic, undermining the speed and agility of their cavalry.

The victory at Lund boosted the morale of the Swedish army. Charles XI was criticized for getting carried away by his success on the right flank, but the battle made him popular with his troops. The remaining Danish forces were forced to retreat to the fortress of Landskrona. Reinforced by their Austrian and German allies, they would once again meet the Swedish army at the Battle of Landskrona.

<text>The Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great (; ) was established on 1 September 1831, by Pope Gregory XVI, seven months after his election as Pope.

The order is one of the five orders of knighthood of the Holy See. The honor is bestowed upon Catholic men and women (and certain notable non-Catholics) in recognition of their personal service to the Holy See and to the Catholic Church, through their unusual labors, their support of the Holy See, and the examples they set in their communities and their countries.

==History and appointment==

The inaugural brief states, in part, that &quot;gentlemen of proven loyalty to the Holy See who, by reason of their nobility of birth and the renown of their deeds or the degree of their munificence, are deemed worthy to be honored by a public expression of esteem on the part of the Holy See&quot;. The end of the brief states that they must progressively maintain, by continued meritorious deed, the reputation and trust they had already inspired, and prove themselves worthy of the honor that had been conferred on them, by unswerving fidelity to God and to the sovereign Pontiff.

The awarding of the Order of St. Gregory the Great presents no particular obligations on the recipients toward the Catholic Church – except for the general ones stated above.

==Insignia==
An eight-pointed cross, the insignia of the order, bears a representation of St. Gregory on the obverse and on the reverse the motto (&quot;For God and Ruler&quot;). The cross is suspended from a red and gold ribbon. In ecclesiastical heraldry, laymen awarded the high rank of Grand Cross can display a red and gold ribbon surrounding the shield in their personal coats of arms, but the recipients of the lower ranks place an appropriate ribbon below the shield. The difference between the civilian and military insignia is that the former group wears the cross hanging from a green crown of laurel, whereas the latter group wears the cross hanging from a trophy of arms.

==Vestments and accoutrements==
The Order comprises four classes:

* &quot;Knight/Dame Grand Cross&quot; (GCSG)
* &quot;Knight/Dame Commander with Star&quot; (KC*SG/DC*SG)
* &quot;Knight/Dame Commander&quot; (KCSG/DCSG)
* &quot;Knight/Dame&quot; (KSG/DSG)

A green uniform was later prescribed by Pope Pius IX. The uniform contains a black beaver-felt hat decorated with black silk ribbons, silver metallic twisted rope, buttons and black ostrich feathers. The jacket, made of green wool, is trimmed with silver metallic thread, and has a tail, nine yellow metal buttons in the front and three buttons on the cuffs and is lined with black satin. Finally, the costume contains suspenders, several yellow and red rosettes, white leather gloves, and a short sword with a handle made of mother of pearl with a medallion of the order at the end.

Knights Grand Cross wear a sash and a badge or star on the left side of the breast; Commanders wear a cross around the neck; and Knights wear a smaller cross on the left breast of the uniform:

<text>This article lists notable industrial disasters, which are disasters caused by industrial companies, either by accident, negligence or incompetence. They are a form of industrial accident where great damage, injury or loss of life are caused.

Other disasters can also be considered industrial disasters, if their causes are rooted in the products or processes of industry. For example, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was made more severe due to the heavy concentration of lumber industry facilities, wood houses, and fuel and other chemicals in a small area.

The Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents is designed to protect people and the environment from industrial accidents. The Convention aims to prevent accidents from occurring, to reduce their frequency and severity, and to mitigate their effects. The Convention addresses primarily industrial accidents in one country that affect the population and the environment of another country.

==Defense industry==
* October 12, 1654: Delft Gunpowder Explosion, Delft, The Netherlands. A gunpowder depot in the center of Delft exploded and killed more than 100 people while destroying a large part of the city center of Delft.

* December 6, 1917: The Halifax Explosion. Halifax, Canada. A ship loaded with about 9,000 tons of high explosives destined for France caught fire as a result of a collision in Halifax harbour, and exploded. The explosion killed about 2,000 and injured about 9,000.
* July 1, 1918 National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell. 134 workers were killed and 250 injured when eight tons of TNT detonated at a munitions factory at the village of Chilwell, now a suburb of Nottingham, UK.
* October 4, 1918: T. A. Gillespie Company Shell Loading Plant explosion. An ammunition plant in Sayreville, New Jersey, exploded, killing approximately 100 people, destroying 300 buildings and causing $18 million in damages.
*March 1, 1924: 1924 Nixon Nitration Works disaster. A plant for processing ammonium nitrate in Edison, New Jersey, exploded, killing 24 people, injuring 100 and destroying several buildings.
*July 10, 1926: Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey. 600,000 lbs. of explosives detonated as a result of a lightning strike. 187 of the 200 buildings in the arsenal were destroyed and debris was found as far as 20 miles away. Damage of close to one billion dollars in 2022 dollars.
* April 14, 1944: Bombay docks explosion. A British freighter SS &quot;Fort Stikine&quot; carrying 1400 tons of explosives and 240 tons of weapons (torpedoes and mines) caught fire due to improper storage, resulting in two massive explosions killing some 800-1300 people. The explosion also led to fires in many parts of the city and the docks needed months of repair work to function again.
* July 17, 1944: Port Chicago Disaster. A munitions explosion that killed 320 people occurred at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine in Port Chicago, California.
* Nov 27, 1944: RAF Fauld Explosion. Explosion of between 3500 and 4000 tonnes of ordnance in an underground munitions store killed 70 people.
* August 9, 1965: Searcy missile silo fire, Arkansas. 53 contract workers were killed during a fire at a Titan missile silo. The cause of the fire was determined to be a welding rod damaging a hydraulic hose carrying Aerozine 50 fuel. This allowed the hypergolic fuel vapors to spread throughout the silo, which were then ignited by an open flame.
* April 13, 1976: Lapua Cartridge Factory explosion. An explosion in a munitions factory in Lapua, Finland, kills 40 workers.
* May 5, 1983: &quot;6 Martie&quot; Ammunition Factory in Zărnești, Romania. An explosion in the production facilities inside the factory completely destroyed two buildings, killing 37 people and injuring more than 300.

==Energy industry==

* October 1957: The Windscale fire, the worst nuclear accident in the United Kingdom&#x27;s history, released substantial amounts of radioactive contamination into the surrounding area at Windscale, Cumberland (now Sellafield, Cumbria). The incident led to about 100 to 240 cancer deaths.
* May 1962: The Centralia mine fire in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania began due to a fire on the surface accidentally igniting the mine&#x27;s shallow coal vein, forcing the gradual evacuation of the Centralia borough. The fire continues to burn underneath the abandoned settlement.
* October 1963: The Vajont Dam overflow, caused by a massive landslide, leading to the complete destruction of several villages and towns, and 1,917 deaths in northern Italy. The accident was anticipated by numerous warnings and signs of dangers disregarded by the electrical company and government.
* March 4, 1965: The Natchitoches explosion: A 32-inch gas transmission pipeline, north of Natchitoches, Louisiana, belonging to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline exploded and burned from stress corrosion cracking on March 4, killing 17 people. At least 9 others were injured, and 7 homes 450 feet from the rupture were destroyed. The same pipeline also had an explosion on May 9, 1955, just 930 feet (280 m) from the 1965 failure.
* March 1967: The supertanker was shipwrecked off the west coast of Cornwall, England, causing an environmental disaster. This was the first major oil spill at sea.
* August 1975: The Banqiao Dam failed in the Henan Province of China due to extraordinarily heavy precipitation from the remnants of Typhoon Nina and poor construction quality of the dam, which was built during the Great Leap Forward. The flood immediately killed over 100,000 people, and another 150,000 died of subsequent epidemic diseases and famine, bringing the total death toll to around 250,000 and making it the worst technical disaster ever.
* March 16, 1978: The &quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot;, a VLCC owned by the company Amoco sank near the northwest coast of France, resulting in the spilling of 68,684,000 US gallons of crude oil (1,635,000 barrels). This is the largest oil spill from an oil tanker in history.
* January 8, 1979: The &quot;Whiddy Island disaster&quot;, also known as the &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; incident, occurred around 1:00 am, when the oil tanker &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; exploded in Bantry Bay, at the offshore jetty for the oil terminal at Whiddy Island, Ireland. The explosion and resulting fire claimed the lives of 50 people (42 French nationals, seven Irish nationals, and one British national).
* March 28, 1979: Three Mile Island accident. Partial nuclear meltdown near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Mechanical failures in the non-nuclear secondary system, followed by a stuck-open pilot-operated relief valve in the primary system, allowed large amounts of reactor coolant to escape. Plant operators initially failed to recognize the loss of coolant, resulting in a partial meltdown. The reactor was brought under control but not before up to 481 PBq (13 million curies) of radioactive gases were released into the atmosphere.
* June 3, 1979: Ixtoc oil spill. The Ixtoc I exploratory oil well suffered a blowout resulting in the third-largest oil spill and the second-largest accidental spill in history.
* March 1980: The Alexander L. Kielland, a Norwegian semi-submersible drilling rig, capsized while working in the Ekofisk oil field, killing 123 people.
* November 20, 1980: A Texaco oil rig drilled into a salt mine transforming Lake Peigneur, a freshwater lake before the accident, into a saltwater lake.
* February 15, 1982: Newfoundland, Canada. The mobile offshore oil rig Ocean Ranger was struck by a rogue wave off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada and sank with the loss of all 84 crew.
* December 19, 1982: The Tacoa disaster, an immense boilover from a fuel oil tank within the premises of a thermal power plant. It caused about 150 fatalities, including firefighters, media workers and bystanders.
* January 7, 1983: An explosion in Newark, New Jersey was felt as far away as 100–130 miles from the epicenter, but only claimed 1 life, and injured 22–24 people.
* July 23, 1984: Romeoville, Illinois, Union Oil refinery explosion killed 19 people.
* November 19, 1984: San Juanico Disaster. A series of boiling liquid expanding vapor explosions (BLEVEs) at a liquefied petroleum gas tank farm killed more than 500 and injured thousands in San Juan Ixhuatepec, Mexico. 
*April 26, 1986: Chernobyl disaster. At the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Pripyat, Soviet Union, (modern-day Ukraine) a test on reactor number four went out of control, resulting in a nuclear meltdown. The ensuing steam explosion and radiation killed up to 50 people with estimates that there may be between 4,000 and several hundred thousand additional cancer deaths over time, although this has not yet been observed and was estimated based on the contested linear no-threshold model. Nuclear fallout could be detected as far away as Canada. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, covering portions of Belarus and Ukraine surrounding Pripyat, remains contaminated and mostly uninhabited. Pripyat itself was totally evacuated and remains as a ghost town, although teeming with wildlife.
* May 5, 1988: Norco, Louisiana, Shell Oil refinery explosion. Hydrocarbon gas escaped from a corroded pipe in a catalytic cracker and was ignited. Louisiana State Police evacuated 2,800 residents from nearby neighborhoods. Seven workers were killed and 42 injured. The total cost arising from the Norco blast is estimated at US$706 million.
* July 6, 1988: Piper Alpha disaster. An explosion and resulting fire on a North Sea oil production platform killed 167 men. The total insured loss was about US$3.4 billion. To date it is rated as the world&#x27;s worst offshore oil disaster in terms both of lives lost and impact to industry.
* March 24, 1989: &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill. The &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot;, an oil tanker bound for Long Beach, California, hit Prince William Sound&#x27;s Bligh Reef, dumping an estimated minimum 10.8 million US gallons (40.9 million litres, or 250,000 barrels) of crude oil into the sea. It is considered to be one of the most devastating human-caused environmental disasters ever to occur. 100,000 to as many as 250,000 seabirds died, as well as at least 2,800 sea otters, approximately 12 river otters, 300 harbor seals, 247 bald eagles, and 22 orcas, and billions of salmon and herring eggs were destroyed. Overall reductions in population have been seen in various ocean animals, including stunted growth in pink salmon populations. Sea otters and ducks also showed higher death rates in following years, partially because they ingested prey from contaminated soil and also from ingestion of oil residues on their hair/feathers due to grooming.
* July 5, 1990: 1990 ARCO explosion. An explosion at a petrochemical plant in Channelview, Texas, killed 17 people and injured five others.
* April 22, 1992: 1992 Guadalajara explosions. A leak of gasoline into the sewer system caused 12 explosions in downtown Guadalajara, Mexico between 10:05 and 11:16 a.m., killing 206 – 252 people and injuring 1,800. Eight kilometers of streets were destroyed or seriously damaged.
* March 23, 2005: Texas City refinery explosion. An explosion occurred at a BP refinery in Texas City, Texas. It is the third largest refinery in the United States and one of the largest in the world, processing 433,000 barrels of crude oil per day and accounting for three percent of that nation&#x27;s gasoline supply. Over 100 were injured, and 15 were confirmed dead, including employees of Jacobs, Fluor and BP. BP has since accepted that its employees contributed to the accident. Several level indicators failed, leading to overfilling of a knockout drum, and light hydrocarbons concentrated at ground level throughout the area. A nearby running diesel truck set off the explosion.
* July 27, 2005: Mumbai High fire. A major fire struck ONGC&#x27;s Mumbai High North offshore complex, located approximately 100 km off Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, when a support vessel collided with the production platform. The fire caused 22 fatalities and extensive material damage.
* December 11, 2005: Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire. A series of explosions at the Buncefield oil storage depot, described as the largest peacetime explosion in Europe, devastated the terminal and many surrounding properties. There were no fatalities. Total damages have been forecast as £750 million.
* December 19, 2007: T2 Laboratories explosion and fire. Runaway reactor for production of gasoline additives explodes at Jacksonville, Florida, killing four.
* December 22, 2008: Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill. 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash were released when a dike ruptured at an ash storage pond at the Tennessee Valley Authority&#x27;s Kingston Fossil Plant in Roane County, Tennessee. 
* August 17, 2009: Sayano–Shushenskaya power station accident. Seventy-five people were killed at a hydroelectric power station when a turbine failed. The failed turbine had been vibrating for a considerable time. Emergency doors to stop the incoming water took a long time to close, while a self-closing lock would have stopped the water in minutes.
* February 7, 2010: 2010 Connecticut power plant explosion. A large explosion occurred at a Kleen Energy Systems 620-megawatt, Siemens combined cycle gas- and oil- fired power plant in Middletown, Connecticut, United States. Preliminary reports attributed the cause of the explosion to a test of the plant&#x27;s energy systems. The plant was still under construction and scheduled to start supplying energy in June 2010. The number of injuries was eventually established to be 27. Five people died in the explosion.
* April 20, 2010: &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven oil platform workers died in an explosion and fire that resulted in a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, considered the largest offshore spill in US history.
* March 11, 2011: As a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami,
**Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan. Regarded as the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster, there were no direct deaths but a few of the plant&#x27;s workers were severely injured or killed by the disaster conditions resulting from the earthquake.
**Fujinuma Dam failure, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The dam failed 20 to 25 minutes after the earthquake as the nearly full reservoir overtopped the dam&#x27;s crest. Eight people were killed. 
**Ichihara gas tank fire, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. A fire in natural gas containers at the Ichihara oil refinery. Six people were injured, and storage tanks were destroyed.
* February 24, 2012: Köprü Dam in Adana Province, Turkey. A hydroelectric dam whose diversion tunnel seal was breached. 97 million cubic meters of water flooded the area downstream of the dam. The accident and flood killed 10 workers.
* October 29, 2012: Hurricane Sandy caused a Consolidated Edison power plant to explode, causing a blackout in most of midtown Manhattan. The blue light emitted from the arc made places as far as Brooklyn glow. No person was killed or injured.
* July 6, 2013: Lac-Mégantic, Quebec Canada. Lac-Mégantic derailment. Forty-seven people were killed when there was a derailment of an oil shipment train. The oil shipment caught fire and exploded, destroying more than thirty buildings. It was the fourth-deadliest rail accident in Canadian history.
* July 23, 2018: Laos dam collapse. Part of a hydroelectric dam system under construction collapsed in Champasak Province, Laos. The collapse lead to widespread destruction and homelessness. 40 people were confirmed dead, at least 98 more were missing, and 6,600 others were displaced.
* June 21, 2019: Philadelphia Refinery Explosion. An explosion at Philadelphia Energy Solutions&#x27; refinery destroyed the alkylation unit, where crude oil is converted to high octane gas, and led to the planned closure of the financially troubled plant. While the explosion and fire only led to a few minor injuries, it was catastrophic for the business.

==Food industry==

* 17 October 1814: The London Beer Flood was an accident at Meux &amp; Co&#x27;s Horse Shoe Brewery, London, on 17 October 1814. It took place when one of the wooden vats of fermenting porter burst. The pressure of the escaping liquid dislodged the valve of another vessel and destroyed several large barrels: between 128,000 and 323,000 imperial gallons (580,000–1,470,000 L; 154,000–388,000 US gal) of beer were released in total.
* 18 June 1875: The Dublin whiskey fire took place on 18 June 1875 in the Liberties area of Dublin. It lasted a single night but killed 13 people, and resulted in €6 million worth of damage in whiskey alone (adjusted for inflation). People drank the deep river of whiskey that is said to have flowed as far as the Coombe. None of the fatalities suffered during the fire were due to smoke inhalation, burns, or any other form of direct contact with the fire itself; all of them were attributed to alcohol poisoning.
* May 2, 1878: Great Mill Disaster. Six flour mills in Minneapolis were destroyed by a flour dust explosion and subsequent fire coming from the Washburn A Mill, killing 18. The mill was rebuilt with updated technology. The explosion led to new safety standards in the milling industry. A dust explosion is the rapid combustion of fine particles suspended in the air within an enclosed location. Dust explosions can occur where any dispersed powdered combustible material is present in high-enough concentrations in the atmosphere or other oxidizing gaseous medium, such as pure oxygen.
* August 9, 1919: The Port Colborne explosion at Port Colborne, Ontario was a dust explosion in the Dominion grain elevator on August 9, 1919. The blast killed 10 and seriously injured 16 more.

* January 15, 1919: Great Molasses Flood. A large molasses tank in Boston, Massachusetts burst and a wave of molasses rushed through the streets at an estimated 35 mph (56 km/h), killing 21 and injuring 150. The event has entered local folklore, and residents claim that on a hot summer day, the area still smells of molasses.
* February 6, 1979: The Roland Mill, located in Bremen, West Germany, was destroyed by a flour dust explosion, killing 14 and injuring 17.
* September 3, 1991: Hamlet chicken processing plant fire in Hamlet, North Carolina, where locked doors trapped workers in a burning processing plant, causing 25 deaths.
* September 3, 1998: Grain elevator explosion in Haysville, Kansas. A series of dust explosions in a large grain storage facility resulted in the deaths of seven people.
* May 9, 2000: The Wild Turkey Distillery fire – On May 9, 2000, a fire destroyed a seven-story aging warehouse at the company in Anderson County, Kentucky. It contained more than 17,000 wooden barrels of whiskey. Burning whiskey flowed from the warehouse setting the woods on fire. Firefighters saved Lawrenceburg&#x27;s water treatment plant from destruction. However, an estimated 20% of the whiskey flowed into the Kentucky River. The river contamination required the temporary shutdown of the water treatment plant. Officials ordered water usage restrictions. Businesses and schools were closed because of the water shortage. The alcohol spill also depleted the oxygen in the river, killing an estimated 228,000 fish along a 66-mile stretch. The EPA and the Coast Guard&#x27;s Gulf Strike Team aerated the river using equipment mounted on barges. The company paid $256,000 to the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife in an effort to restore the fish population in the river.
* February 7, 2008: The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion in Port Wentworth, Georgia, United States. Fourteen people were killed and 42 injured when a dust explosion occurred at a sugar refinery owned by Imperial Sugar.
* March 12, 2008: Morin-Heights, Quebec, Canada. A roof collapse in the Gourmet du Village bakery warehouse killed three workers.
* June 9, 2009: The 2009 ConAgra Foods plant explosion, when a natural gas explosion at the ConAgra Foods Slim Jim production facility in Garner, North Carolina, United States killed four people and triggered an ammonia leak. 
* September 2013: The Honolulu molasses spill – In September 2013, 1,400 tons of molasses spilled into Honolulu Harbor. The spill was discovered on 9 September 2013. It was caused by a faulty pipe, for which the shipping company Matson Navigation Co. took responsibility. Molasses is an unregulated product, and neither Matson nor government officials had a contingency plan to respond to a molasses spill. Natural currents and weather were expected to eventually dilute and flush the molasses out of the harbor and a nearby lagoon.

<text>Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism is a series of periodical essays by Matthew Arnold, first published in Cornhill Magazine 1867–68 and collected as a book in 1869. The preface was added in 1869.

Arnold&#x27;s famous piece of writing on culture established his High Victorian cultural agenda which remained dominant in debate from the 1860s until the 1950s.

According to his view advanced in the book, &quot;Culture [...] is a study of perfection&quot;. He further wrote that: &quot;[Culture] seeks to do away with classes; to make the best that has been thought and known in the world current everywhere; to make all men live in an atmosphere of sweetness and light [...]&quot;.

His often quoted phrase &quot;[culture is] the best which has been thought and said&quot; comes from the Preface to &quot;Culture and Anarchy&quot;:

:The whole scope of the essay is to recommend culture as the great help out of our present difficulties; culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world, and, through this knowledge, turning a stream of fresh and free thought upon our stock notions and habits, which we now follow staunchly but mechanically, vainly imagining that there is a virtue in following them staunchly which makes up for the mischief of following them mechanically.

The book contains most of the terms – culture, sweetness and light, Barbarian, Philistine, Hebraism, and many others – which are more associated with Arnold&#x27;s work influence.

<text>Bopal is an area in Ahmedabad City, located in the state of Gujarat, India. In 2015, Bopal and its neighbouring area, Ghuma, were merged and granted municipality status.

For electoral purposes, it falls under the Ghatlodiya election-area.

==Demographics==
In the 2001 Census of India, Bopal had a population of 12,181. Males and females constituted 53% and 47% of the population, respectively. Bopal had an average literacy rate of 80%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with male literacy of 84% and female literacy of 75%.

The population of Bopal-Ghuma together in 2001 was 18,553, which increased to 55,068 in 2011. As of 2023, the total population in Bopal-Ghuma Nagarpalika is more than 100,000. This rise has been attributed to BRTS and AMTS connectivity alongside affordable real-estate prices.

==Infrastructure==
Bopal has experienced a growth in infrastructure in the past decade. The Bopal-Ghuma Nagarpalika has rolled out schemes for several development works. 
The multiplex theatre &quot;City Gold&quot; was built during this time. BRTS route has end-mile connectivity to Ghuma that goes from Iskon to Bopal-Ambli road to Ghuma via Bopal Cross Roads.This route includes a direct line from the Shivranjini cross-roads to the Bopal roundabout. The government was criticized for spending Rs 50 million for building a road and then 6 months later, digging it up all over again for laying the BRTS route.

Since 2005, many new properties have come up around Basant Bahar Road (some people call it Gala Gymkhana Road) as well as the Bopal-Ghuma 4 km stretch. The villages Ghuma and Bopal are very close – it is hard to differentiate. The South Bopal area (popularly known as SoBo) has become a hotspot of the Bopal area. The well-known road of North Bopal area is the &#x27;Chocolate&#x27; road which passes through Bopal Lake, DPS, ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) colony, GEB Electrical supply office, and connects with Shela Road.

There are a high number of private and public sector banks in the area, including HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, State Bank of India, Dena Bank, Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank, Kalupur Bank, Punjab National Bank, Bank Of India, and most recently the Oriental Bank of Commerce.

Drinking water has high total dissolved solids. A 2005 study of 10 residential areas in Ahmedabad city found that Bopal has the highest SC (Specific Conductivity), fluoride content and chloride content in groundwater, making it necessary for most of the dwellers to use reverse osmosis purified water. In early 2019, the government announced a 60 million per day capacity Narmada Canal based water project for the area.

Drainage line was a big problem, but now the local authority, AUDA (Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority), has completed drainage facilities and most of the properties in Bopal are now connected with drainage line. Also, the rainwater pipeline has been constructed and the roads were widened by AUDA in Bopal. The main road connecting Ghuma and Bopal with S.P. Ring Road nowadays observes very high traffic during office hours in the morning as well as the evening. AUDA has declared that a flyover will be constructed on S.P. Ring Road at the Bopal Cross Roads. This will surely ease traffic flow at the junction in the coming years. The flyover construction work commenced after a monsoon in 2014 and is currently underway.

It is expected in early 2015 that Bopal may emerge as a key residential location due to its proximity to the business districts in Prahladnagar and along the S.G. Highway, and improving physical infrastructure in the region.

AUDA has proposed to construct 2,500 homes in the Bopal area by 2016 for people from different income groups as a part of social development initiative

The rapid urbanization and growing population have increased criminal activities in Bopal &amp; Ghuma. The Gujarat Police has been inadequate in serving the expanding security needs of these regions and is trying to cope by deploying additional police personnel.

AUDA plans to develop a sewage treatment plant around the residential affordable housing (RAH) zone that will supply treated water to Bopal and Ghuma lakes.

The development has also led to Bopal Crossroads becoming one of the most polluted areas in Ahmedabad city.

South Bopal, popularly known as SoBo, is a newer residential area. In December 2018, the government opened a 6,235 sq. km. park for the residents, featuring special seating arrangements for senior citizens, three gazebos, a walkway for fitness enthusiasts, and a basketball and volleyball court. A library and a fire station are also coming up in the area.

== Healthcare ==
A Community Health Center (CHC) has been functional since June 2015. The state-of-the-art Krishna Heart Center is also located in Ghuma.

==Education==

Bopal, Ghuma, and nearby areas have many Gujarati &amp; English medium self-financed and grant-in-aid schools.

Self-financed English medium schools include Delhi Public School, Shivashish School, New Tulip International School, St. Ann&#x27;s School, Shri Ram Vidhyalaya,
Little Bard High School, Satyamev Jayate International School,o Shri Ram Vidhyalaya, appollo international school,Zydus School of Excellence, Sanskardham.

Self-financed Gujarati medium schools include Shivashish Vidhyamandir, M K Patel High School, Ravi Madhyamik Shala, Sanskardham.

<text>The Three E.P.&#x27;s is a compilation album of the first three releases by Scottish musical group The Beta Band, comprising the EPs &quot;Champion Versions&quot;, &quot;The Patty Patty Sound&quot; and &quot;Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos&quot;. The album was released on 28 September 1998 in the United Kingdom by Regal and on 26 January 1999 in the United States by Astralwerks. Its cover art includes the main image from each of the EPs.

&quot;The Three E.P.&#x27;s&quot; was prominently featured in a scene from the 2000 film &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, in which record store owner Rob Gordon (John Cusack) tells his co-workers that he would sell five copies of the album, and plays &quot;Dry the Rain&quot; in his store for his customers. Astralwerks, the band&#x27;s American label, reported that sales of &quot;The Three E.P.&#x27;s&quot; had quadrupled within a month of the film&#x27;s March 2000 release.

Front man Steve Mason later said, &quot;At the time I just thought this is the way all music should be made. I hated the people who were just in bands; who the fuck wants to be in a band with a guitarist and a bassist and a lead singer? All this Britpop shit had been rammed down everyone&#x27;s throats. Honesty and experimentation were our weapons of choice.&quot;

==Critical reception==

In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;The Three E.P.&#x27;s&quot; at number 74 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed the album at number 23 in its list of the Top 100 Albums of the 1990s.

<doc id="1234864" wikidata="Q2756643" url="?curid=1234864" title="RC Succession">
<text>was an influential Japanese rock band from Tokyo, formed in 1968. One of Japan&#x27;s longest-running bands, it went through many line-up changes over the years with front man Kiyoshiro Imawano and bassist Kazuo Kobayashi the only constant members, before disbanding in January 1991.

In 2003, HMV Japan ranked RC Succession at No. 16 on their list of the &quot;Top 100 Japanese Pops Artists&quot;. In September 2007, &quot;Rolling Stone Japan&quot; rated their 1980 live album &quot;Rhapsody&quot; at No. 2 and their 1988 cover album &quot;Covers&quot; at No. 41 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Japanese Rock Albums of All Time&quot;. &quot;Covers&quot; was named number 1 on &quot;Bounce&quot;″s 2009 list of &quot;54 Standard Japanese Rock Albums&quot;.

== History ==
In 1966, Imawano formed a band named &quot;the Clover&quot; with Kenchi Haren. This band broke up the following year, however, the remaining members added some new members and called it &quot;the Remainders of the Clover&quot;. This band changed members again in 1968, and this time they were renamed to &quot;The Remainders of the Clover Succession&quot;. The name was shortened and the band &quot;RC Succession&quot; was born. The group first started as a Tokyo-based folk trio in 1966 when leader Kiyoshiro Imawano was still in junior high school and playing in a Ventures copy band. The group is hard to classify, but in early years their sound was mostly R&amp;B fashioned music played acoustically. Imawano, however, has quite a distinctive high warbling voice that is not typical of soul singers. More than a singer, he is known as a lyricist for his clever and timely lyrics. RC Succession developed a reputation early on as a strong live band, but did not have a hit record until 1972, and then not again for a long time after that. In the late 70s the group took on a more electric sound, as well as an odd glam influenced look, with Imawano in particular often appearing in loud clothing and heavy makeup. The group became part of a hot late 70s scene which included Yellow Magic Orchestra, The Plastics, and Sandii &amp; The Sunsetz, created when these groups began interacting with foreign bands and releasing internationally. RC Succession did not catch on internationally as much as some of the others.

In 1970, RC Succession made its debut as an acoustic trio of Kiyoshiro Imawano (vo., gt.), Wassho Rinko (another name for Kazuo Kobayashi) (b.) and Kenchi Haren (gt.). After guitarist Reichi &quot;Chabo&quot; Nakaido joined the band in 1978 replacing Haren, their popularity grew as they strengthened their rock and roll sound. Since then, they released series of milestone numbers including &quot;Ameagari no Yozora Ni&quot; (1980) and &quot;Transistor Radio&quot; (1980).

in 1982, the band enter in part of a famous concert in 1982 called &quot;The Day of R&amp;B&quot;, which took place at a packed baseball stadium and included as headliners Chuck Berry and Sam Moore of Sam &amp; Dave. The event was filmed and released as a video. Another thing in 1982 that helped establish them as a major act was a collaboration with Ryucihi Sakamoto called &quot;Ikenai Rouge Magic&quot;. The single&#x27;s jacket and promotional picture featured Imawano and Sakamoto kissing - quite a shocker at the time. The song was also used in a popular TV commercial. Among the best-known RC Succession songs are &quot;Ameagari No Yozora Ni&quot; and &quot;Toranjisuta Rajio&quot;. RC Succession have often collaborated with other artists, and Imawano marks among the highlights of his career working with his heroes Booker T. &amp; The MG&#x27;s. RC Succession are also unusual in that for a Japanese pop band they are fairly political and outspoken. They are one of the few Japanese bands that regularly play benefits, and Imawano has spoken out against war, 
nuclear power and in favor of Tibetan freedom.

In 1988, the band recorded an album consisting of cover versions of rock and pop standards (with original Japanese lyrics) aptly named &quot;Covers&quot;. It was originally intended for a release from the band&#x27;s record company Toshiba EMI, however, the release was suddenly canceled with small notice by Toshiba EMI on newspapers claiming &quot;The album was too wonderful to be released.&quot; Two months later in August 1988, it was released by Kitty Records. Kiyoshiro revealed that there had been pressure from Toshiba to remove some of the anti-war and anti-nuclear songs from the album. The album gained wide attention due to the incident, and debuted at number one of the Oricon album chart.

Members Gee2Woo (keyboards) and Kozo Niida (drums) left the band in 1990. Kiyoshiro, Nakaido, and Kazuo Kobayashi (bass) released the album &quot;Baby a Go-Go&quot; that September with former Carmen Maki &amp; Oz member Hirofumi Kasuga on drums. Former Vow Wow keyboardist Rei Atsumi also joined soon after. However, RC Succession held their last concert at the Nippon Budokan on December 25, 1990.

After they stopped performing, Kiyoshiro and Nakaido continued as solo artists, while other members (Kobayashi, Niida, and Gee2Woo) resumed their careers as session players. While the band never played together again, Kiyoshiro and Nakaido kept close relationships and collaborated from time to time, including the 1994 album &quot;Glad All Over&quot; which was credited to Kiyoshiro Imawano &amp; Reichi Nakaido.

Kiyoshiro died of cancer on May 2, 2009.

<text>Admiral Sir Henry Harwood Harwood, (19 January 1888 – 9 June 1950) was a Royal Navy officer who won fame in the Battle of the River Plate during the Second World War.

==Early life==
Following education at Stubbington House School, Harwood entered the Royal Navy in 1904 and specialised in torpedoes. He served in the First World War. In 1919, he served on the battleship ), 1st Battle Squadron. By 1929 he had been promoted to captain and become the commanding officer of the destroyer and Senior Officer of the 9th Destroyer Division.

In 1931 and 1932, Harwood attended the Imperial Defence College. Upon completion of the course in March 1932, he became flag captain of the heavy cruiser whilst at the same time serving as Chief Staff Officer to the Rear-Admiral Commanding the 1st Cruiser Squadron. From July 1934 until 1936, Harwood served on the staff of the Royal Naval War College at Greenwich ().

In September 1936, Harwood was appointed commodore and given command of the South American Division of the America and West Indies Station, whilst at the same time serving as commanding officer of the cruiser . At the outbreak of the Second World War, command of HMS &quot;Exeter&quot; passed to Captain F. S. Bell. Commodore Harwood remained in &quot;Exeter&quot; until he transferred his pennant to HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; on 27 August.

==Second World War==
Harwood commanded a squadron consisting of the heavy cruisers and , and the light cruisers HMS &quot;Achilles&quot; and . He flew his broad pennant in &quot;Ajax&quot; as his flagship. The squadron was deployed to the South Atlantic against the , which was attacking Allied shipping there.

Harwood suspected that &quot;Graf Spee&quot; would try to strike next at the merchant shipping off the River Plate estuary. With &quot;Cumberland&quot; being absent for repairs, Harwood deployed his other three cruisers off the estuary on 12 December. In the ensuing Battle of the River Plate on 13 December, Harwood&#x27;s cruisers were damaged, but so was &quot;Graf Spee&quot;, which fled to Montevideo in neutral Uruguay. She was scuttled there a few days later. For this action, Harwood was promoted to rear admiral and knighted.

From December 1940 to April 1942, Rear-Admiral Harwood served as a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty and Assistant Chief of Naval Staff. In April 1942, Harwood was promoted to vice-admiral and Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, and flew his flag at . The command was later split, and he became Commander-in-Chief, Levant, in February 1943, with responsibility for flank support and seaborne supply of the British Eighth Army.

In April 1944, Harwood became Admiral Commanding, Orkneys and Shetlands (). He retired on 15 August 1945 with the rank of admiral, having been declared medically unfit for further duty.

==Post-war==
Sir Henry Harwood died in Goring-on-Thames in 1950. Harwood Avenue, the main thoroughfare in the town of Ajax, Ontario, was named after him. In the 1956 film, &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot;, Harwood was played by Anthony Quayle.

<text>Sir John Holker (1828 – 24 May 1882) was a British lawyer, politician, and judge. He sat as a Member of Parliament for Preston from 1872 until his death ten years later. He was first Solicitor General and later Attorney General in the second government of Benjamin Disraeli.

== Biography ==
Holker was born in Bury, Lancashire, and educated at Bury Grammar School. After being articled to a solicitor, he was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1854, where he was later a bencher, and treasurer in 1875. He joined the Northern Circuit, and lived in Manchester. He married in 1861 but had no children. After his first wife died, he remarried in 1874 to Miss Mary Lucia Richardson. There were no children from either marriage.

He returned to London in 1864, where he developed a very successful and lucrative legal practice, and was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1866.

He was the Conservative candidate at a by-election in Preston in 1872, one of the first held after the Ballot Act 1872 required the use of a secret ballot. He served as Member of Parliament for Preston until his death in 1882. He became Solicitor General in the government of Benjamin Disraeli in 1874, and was knighted. He replaced Sir Richard Baggallay as Attorney General in 1875, retaining in the position until Liberals won the general election in 1880.

He was appointed a Lord Justice of Appeal in January 1882, but resigned due to ill health in May, and died in London a few days later.

<doc id="1234884" wikidata="Q4933021" url="?curid=1234884" title="Bob Kevoian">
<text>Robert James Kevoian (born December 2, 1950) is a retired American radio host of the nationally syndicated radio show &quot;The Bob &amp; Tom Show&quot; together with his partner, Tom Griswold. The show is broadcast from WFBQ&#x27;s studios in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Education==
Kevoian is a 1973 graduate of California State University, Long Beach. With no formal training in radio, Kevoian had never set foot in a radio studio until his time at WBMN in Petoskey, Michigan, where he met future business partner Tom Griswold. Kevoian was awarded an honorary doctorate in Communications from Central Michigan University where he gave the commencement speech in 2003.

==Entertainment career==
After touring the U.S. for three years as sound engineer of The Young Americans, Kevoian began his radio career at WMBN in Petoskey, Michigan, in 1979. That lasted until 1982, when Kevoian joined cross-town WJML where Bob and Tom teamed up as a regular morning show. &quot;We were there for 12 to 18 months,&quot; Kevoian recalls. The pairing of one of syndicated radio&#x27;s most successful morning shows came when radio personality-by-day Kevoian moonlighted as a bartender at Harbor Springs, Michigan&#x27;s Bar Harbor. &quot;In small town radio, you needed to supplement your income by doing anything,&quot; the Long Beach State University alum states. &quot;Tom came in after a J. Geils concert at Castle Farms in [nearby] Charlevoix and ordered a drink. At the end of the bar was another guy who worked in Country radio.&quot; The two radio talents were talking about the inferior nature of their respective stations&#x27; cart machines. &quot;Tom overheard us and asked if we worked in radio and I told him I was doing middays,&quot; Kevoian remembers. &quot;Tom said he did a year of radio in Florida, but was out of work and wanted to visit the station and look at the trades. Two days later, he was hired as my PD; it was pretty wild.&quot; They achieved a 44 share in the ratings and in order to get rid of them the competition made a compilation tape of their best bits and mailed it to the Superstars Convention, a gathering of program directors from 300 stations, where it was played. They started getting offers from all over the country. He is the producer, director, writer and composed credits for The &quot;Bob and Tom Show Home Movie&quot;, 2004. Kevoian participated in the Bob and Tom Radio: The Comedy Tour shows recorded in Anderson, Indiana. Kevoian has personally produced over 15,000 &quot;bits&quot; used in his show, some of which are actually his original ideas.
===Retirement===
On November 5, 2015, after being inducted along with Tom Griswold into the National Radio Hall of Fame, Kevoian announced his retirement effective at the end of 2015. His last live show as co-host aired on December 17, 2015. On November 17, 2016, Bob and Tom were reunited when they were inducted into the Indiana Broadcasters Hall of Fame. Kevoian made his first post-retirement appearance as a guest host on April 3, 2017, when the show was in Cincinnati for the Cincinnati Reds home opener. Kevoian returned again on December 8, 2017, filling in for Tom Griswold. Kevoian returned March 30, 2018, and March 28, 2019, for the Cincinnati Reds opening day broadcast and again on May 24, 2019, for the Indianapolis 500 Bob and Tom Show. Kevoian returned once again on April 17, 2020, to the show.

==On TV==
The Bob and Tom Show aired nightly on WGN America and occasionally weekend best of airings until its cancellation in September 2010.

==Personal life==
Kevoian was born in Los Angeles, California, to John Hike &quot;Toby&quot; Kevoian and Jean Baker. On April 2, 2005, he married his current wife, Becky Martin. He has a son named Toby. Kevoian has stepsons named Wade and Joey. Kevoian is almost always seen wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers hat as a tribute to his father, who was a longtime employee of the Dodgers, but considers himself &quot;a big Cincinnati Reds fan.&quot; Kevoian is an avid guitar player and has written some of the lyrics and music for the show&#x27;s comedic parodies. Kevoian&#x27;s brother-in-law (Becky&#x27;s brother) is world-renowned tuba player Rex Martin. Kevoian&#x27;s younger brother is actor Peter Kevoian. His mother was on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot; and won a Brunswick pool table, which she traded for cases of oyster stew. She retired from the Los Angeles County Office of Education in Downey, California. Kevoian also likes to collect &quot;large&quot; ordinary items, such as coffee cups or safety pins that are extremely large compared to their normal sizes. Kevoian likewise keeps a collection of these &quot;large&quot; items in his studio.

On June 7, 2023, Kevoian made a guest appearance on the Bob &amp; Tom show to reveal he had been diagnosed with gastric cancer. Kevoian says the outlook is very good and he has responded to treatment well. While on the show Kevoian promoted his podcast &quot;The Bob &amp; Cancer show&quot;. The show includes him, his wife Becky Kevoian, and longtime Bob &amp; Tom show friend Whit Grayson. The show chronicles his journey with cancer and highlights the humorous aspects of it. During his treatment, it has been stated that he has experienced no hair loss and his iconic mustache is still intact and ready to celebrate its 54th birthday on June 18, 2023.

<doc id="1234896" wikidata="Q212526" url="?curid=1234896" title="Trinidad piping guan">
<text>The Trinidad piping guan (Pipile pipile) locally known as the pawi, is a bird in the chachalaca, guan and curassow family Cracidae, endemic to the island of Trinidad. It is a large bird, somewhat resembling a turkey in appearance, and research has shown that its nearest living relative is the blue-throated piping guan from South America. It is a mainly arboreal species feeding mostly on fruit, but also on flowers and leaves. At one time abundant, it has declined in numbers and been extirpated from much of its natural range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird as &quot;critically endangered&quot;.

==Description==
This is a medium-sized cracid, 60 cm in length, and similar in general appearance to a turkey, with a thin neck and small head. It is mainly black with a purple gloss. The large crest is blackish, edged with white, and there are large white wing patches. The bare face and wattle are blue, and the legs are red.

The Trinidad piping guan&#x27;s call is a thin piping. The wings whirr in flight.

==Ecology==
They are forest birds, and the nest is built in a tree. Three large white eggs are laid, the female alone incubating. This arboreal species feeds on fruit and berries (such as those from the fragrant nutmeg and baboonwood), as well as flowers and leaves. The confirmation of small insects being a part of their diet has not been made yet.

==Taxonomy==

Data confirms that the other blue-wattled species, the blue-throated piping guan, is the Trinidad species&#x27; closest living relative. The same data suggests that these diverged some 400,000 years ago at latest, perhaps as early as 1.6 mya, whereas Trinidad has been an island only since the end of the last ice age. This indicates that the Trinidad piping guan evolved in mainland South America, being driven to its relict island range in more recent times. The holotype of this species was supposedly collected in the &quot;Orinoco River [region] near Cumaná&quot; (del Hoyo 1994a,b). This locality has usually been considered erroneous. However, as it indicates an area on the mainland roughly opposite Trinidad, it might actually be correct and indicate that the Trinidad piping guan was not extirpated from Venezuela until around 1800. In South America, the form &quot;cumanensis&quot; has a greenish gloss to the plumage, a white face and crest, and a blue wattle, &quot;cujubi&quot; has a blue face and a red wattle, and &quot; jacutinga&quot; has a black face and a red wattle.&quot;

==Status==
This species is found only in Trinidad where it was once abundant throughout the Northern Range and the southern Trinity Hills, and also occurred in lowland areas such as the Nariva Swamp and Aripo Savannas. It is threatened by illegal hunting and to a lesser extent by habitat destruction. It is now absent from the lowlands, and almost certainly extinct in the Trinity Hills where surveys have failed to find it since 1994. There is a credible report of a sighting in 2000 in the Northern Range and there are of suitable habitat there so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird as &quot;critically endangered&quot;.

<doc id="1234897" wikidata="Q7385628" url="?curid=1234897" title="Ryūkōka">
<text>is a Japanese musical genre. The term originally denoted any kind of &quot;popular music&quot; in Japanese, and is the sinic reading of &quot;hayariuta&quot;, used for commercial music of Edo Period. Therefore, &quot;imayō&quot;, which was promoted by Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the Heian period, was a kind of &quot;ryūkōka&quot;. Today, however, &quot;ryūkōka&quot; refers specifically to Japanese popular music from the late 1920s through the early 1960s. Some of the roots of &quot;ryūkōka&quot; were developed from Western classical music. &quot;Ryūkōka&quot; ultimately split into two genres: &quot;enka&quot; and &quot;poppusu&quot;. Unlike &quot;enka&quot;, archetypal &quot;ryūkōka&quot; songs did not use the &quot;kobushi&quot; method of singing. &quot;Ryūkōka&quot; used legato. Bin Uehara and Yoshio Tabata are considered to be among the founders of the modern style of &quot;kobushi&quot; singing.

Many composers and singers of &quot;ryūkōka&quot; went on to earn official distinctions; Ichiro Fujiyama and composers Masao Koga and Ryoichi Hattori received the People&#x27;s Honour Award in later years.

Although &quot;enka&quot; branched off from &quot;ryūkōka&quot;, many singers of the latter genre proclaimed strong disdain for its stylistic descendant. In a 1981 interview, Noriko Awaya said &quot;Whenever I hear &quot;enka&quot;, I have to get away from the music because I feel like vomiting.&quot;

==History==
=== 1914–1927: Origin ===

In 1914, Sumako Matsui&#x27;s song &quot;Katyusha&#x27;s song&quot;, composed by Shinpei Nakayama, was used as a theme of the rendition &quot;Resurrection&quot; in Japan. The record of the song sold 20,000 copies. One theory holds that this was the first &quot;ryūkōka&quot; song, which was made by Hogetsu Shimamura&#x27;s order: &quot;the tune between Japanese popular folk music and Western music&quot;. However, street performers called had been popular until record labels such as the Victor Company of Japan began to produce songs in the early Shōwa period.

Although Matsui committed suicide after Shimamura&#x27;s death, Nakayama continued to develop his music. During his career, he composed about 3,000 songs such as the 1921 song &quot;Teru teru bozu&quot;. Nakayama transferred Japanese traditional music to staff-style by main force. His 1921 song was later covered by various singers, but was at first best known for being covered by violin enka-shi featuring Orchestra. The pentatonic scale used in this song was &quot;Minor scale without forth and seventh degree&quot;. However, the music based on the scale had difficult in presenting chord and harmony because traditional Japanese music didn&#x27;t adopt equal temperament.

Nakayama&#x27;s songs were based on Japanese folk music called &quot;min&#x27;yō&quot;, but also adopted Western musical style. Therefore, his music was called .

===1928–1930: Beginning of popularity===

In the early Showa period, the microphone was introduced into the popular music of Japan. Teiichi Futamura released his cover version of in 1928. The song was originally composed by Fred Fisher. Chiyako Sato&#x27;s 1928 song , composed by Nakayama, sold 100,000 copies. The song was also sung by singer Yoshie Fujiwara. Chiyako Sato&#x27;s 1929 song &quot;Tokyo March&quot; sold more than 300,000 copies.

===1931–1937: Rising popularity===
Some of the country&#x27;s first major stars were singer Ichiro Fujiyama and composer Masao Koga. Koga attempted to initiate fusion of Western jazz and Japanese dodoitsu. Fujiyama&#x27;s 1931 song , composed by Koga, became a major hit in Japan. This song created a fusion of Fujiyama&#x27;s crooning and Koga&#x27;s guitar play. Using the vocal technic &quot;Mezza Voce&quot; with a microphone, Fujiyama sang the song by the deep voice of not Opera&#x27;s G minor but D minor. Fujiyama&#x27;s song sold 600,000 copies. However, Fujiyama was an elite student, who specialized Western classical music in the Tokyo Music School. &quot;Ryūkōka&quot; songs often dealt with the &quot;Ero Guro Nansensu&quot; things. Since his school regarded &quot;ryūkōka&quot; as bad form at that time, Fujiyama was once suspended from the school, though Fujiyama was not dismissed from the school because Klaus Pringsheim Sr., a professor of the school, opposed the proposal of Fujiyama&#x27;s expulsion.

This period also saw the popularity of &quot;geisha&quot; singers such as Ichimaru and Katsutaro Kouta. Katsutaro became famous when Fujiyama was turned out of &quot;ryūkōka&quot;. Her song sold 600,000 copies. Katsutaro and Issei Mishima recorded duet song &quot;Tokyo Ondo&quot;. The song was composed by Shinpei Nakayama and was released in 1933. The single &quot;Tokyo Ondo&quot; sold 1,200,000 copies.

When Fujiyama sang Western classic lied songs, those songs were called &quot;kayōkyoku&quot;, but the term &quot;kayōkyoku&quot; went on to be used as another name of &quot;ryūkōka&quot; in NHK. At first, Koga was a good co-worker for Fujiyama but they moved apart from each other because Koga sought &quot;Japanese&quot; music. On the other hand, Yoshie Fujiwara drew a clear line between him and &quot;ryūkōka&quot; and established the Fujiwara Opera in 1934, launching the establishment of Japanese Opera. Baritone singer Taro Shoji&#x27;s 1934 song also became popular, though he did not know Kunisada Chūji, the theme of the song.

Soprano singer Noriko Awaya also sang &quot;ryūkōka&quot;, but the Toyo Music School once annulled her graduation. However, her song became a hit in 1937. The song was composed by jazz composer Ryoichi Hattori. She was called &quot;Queen of Blues&quot;, though term &quot;blues&quot; was just a song title.

===1937–1945: Influences of war===
In 1936, NHK started radio program to compete with &quot;ryūkōka&quot;, which was under the influence of &quot;Ero Guro Nansensu&quot;, but it soon began to air war songs around July 1937. The program was renamed to in 1941 and then in 1942. The songs during the war were called . During the war, many musicians were forced to write war songs. Yuji Koseki composed many war songs and was later criticised as a war collaborator, though he seemed to be touched with remorse. Koseki composed released in 1937. Although the song was a B-side song, it sold 600,000 copies. The 1937 song sold 1,000,000 copies. However, Japanese jazz musicians such as Ryoichi Hattori seemed to be vigorless to compose war songs. His son Katsuhisa Hattori claimed that he was not an antinationalist and he technically were hardly not able to compose war songs even if they wanted to make those because Japanese war songs were musically &quot;enka&quot;.
On the other hand, former enka-shi Haruo Oka&#x27;s debut song was released in 1939. Yoshio Tabata also mede his debut with song in 1939. &quot;Rōkyoku&quot; (&quot;naniwa-bushi&quot;) was used for enhancing the national prestige.
Although many war songs were made after the beginning of the Pacific War, , sung by Noboru Kirishima and Akiko Futaba, became popular as a lyrical song. When the war was nearing an end, the theme included frightful spectacles such as the Battle of Attu, Guadalcanal Campaign and Marshall Islands Campaign. Oka went to Ambon Island, but fell ill and soon returned to Japan. Bin Uehara, who used &quot;kobushi&quot; of &quot;naniwa-bushi&quot; for singing, was killed in the New Guinea campaign and Fujiyama was taken prisoner in Indonesia.
After the war, the songs during the war have been regarded as a taboo even in Japan despite those historical importance. One of war songs, , composed by Isao Hayashi, went on to become a theme of Japanese right-wing groups called &quot;uyoku dantai&quot;. Li Xianglan&#x27;s &quot;Suzhou Nocturne&quot;, composed by Hattori, has remained controversial in China, though it was a non-propaganda song. After the war, Taro Shoji, who heard the Gyokuon-hōsō in Nagano Prefecture, was once banned from singing many of his songs because those were regarded as nationalistic. &quot;Rōkyoku&quot; faded into the wallpaper with the spread of television in the postwar period. In 1946, NHK revived their music program as &quot;Radio Kayō&quot; and it was later reformed as &quot;Minna no Uta&quot;, but NHK was disinclined to mention its former history.

===1945–1954: Postwar popularity===
Michiko Namiki&#x27;s song sung by Michiko Namiki and Noboru Kirishima, airing in 1945 movie &quot;Soyokaze&quot;, became popular. Haruo Oka also released hit songs such as his 1946 song and his 1948 song . Ichiro Fujiyama, who was falsely reported to have been killed in battle, returned to Japan in 1946.
Ryoichi Hattori, who moved to Shanghai in 1944, contributed to advancing Japanese &quot;poppusu&quot; music after the war. Shizuko Kasagi&#x27;s 1947 song &quot;Tokyo Boogie-Woogie&quot;, composed by Hattori, became popular. Hattori also composed Ichimaru&#x27;s 1949 song &quot;Shamisen Boogie-Woogie&quot;. Around that time, Hibari Misora became known as an impersonator of Kasagi. She made her debut with song &quot;Kappa Boogie-Woogie&quot; in 1949. Hattori&#x27;s composed song , which was sung by Ichiro Fujiyama and Mitsue Nara, became a major hit in the early post-war years in Japan.

Yuji Koseki composed and . &quot;Nagasaki no Kane&quot;, based on Takashi Nagai&#x27;s book &quot;The Bells of Nagasaki&quot;, was sung by Fujiyama in 1949. Fujiyama became the final singer of all singers at the 1st Kōhaku Uta Gassen with &quot;Nagasaki no Kane&quot; in 1951. Chiemi Eri debuted in 1952 and Izumi Yukimura debuted in 1953. Fujiyama moved to NHK in 1954 and returned to his original style―classical music. He went on to become a conductor for &quot;Hotaru no Hikari&quot; at the Kōhaku Uta Gassen.

===1955–1963: Transformation of music===
New singers such as Hibari Misora, Hachiro Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi and Chiyoko Shimakura became popular when old singers became unpopular. The period between around 1955 and 1964 saw the popularity of &quot;kayōkyoku&quot;. Around that time, Japanese composers went on to establish their own genres such as Toru Funamura and Minoru Endo&#x27;s &quot;Enka&quot;, Tadashi Yoshida&#x27;s &quot;Mood Kayō&quot;, and Hachidai Nakamura and Hiroshi Miyagawa&#x27;s &quot;Jazz&quot;. Masao Koga renounced his pre-war musical style, approaching Hibari Misora.

The song &quot;Otomisan&quot; was made for being sung by Haruo Oka, but was eventually sung by Hachiro Kasuga and became a major hit in Japan in 1954. The single sold over one million copies. The song was composed by Masanobu Tokuchi, who came from the Ryukyu Islands. Kasuga&#x27;s 1955 song &quot;Wakare no Ipponsugi&quot;, composed by Funamura, also became a hit song. Funamura also composed Michiya Mihashi&#x27;s 1955 song &quot;Anoko Ga Naiteru Hatoba&quot;. &quot;Ryōkyōku&quot; singers such as Haruo Minami and Hideo Murata joined Japanese popular music. Hachiro Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi and Hideo Murata went on to form their genre later called &quot;enka&quot;.
Frank Nagai&#x27;s 1957 song &quot;Yūrakuchō de Aimashō&quot;, composed by Yoshida, also became popular. Around that time, however, Japanese rock and roll movement began and the Nichigeki Western Carnival was opened in 1958. The concerts were taken part in by future popular singers such as Mickey Curtis and Kyu Sakamoto. Against Japanese rock and roll movement, Yukio Hashi shocked Japanese popular music as a young &quot;enka&quot; singer because singers of the genre were elderly singers such as Hachiro Kasuga and Michiya Mihashi.

Japanese singers such as Kyu Sakamoto, The Peanuts and Mieko Hirota covered American songs at first, but they began to sing their own song. Sakamoto&#x27;s 1961 single &quot;Ue o muite arukō&quot;, composed by Nakamura, became a major hit in Japan. On the other hand, Hideo Murata&#x27;s 1961 single , composed by Toru Funamura, sold over one million copies in Japan. On June 5, 1962, Saburō Kitajima made his debut with the single &quot;Bungacha Bushi.&quot; Funamura composed Kitajima&#x27;s 1962 hit song . Hiroshi Miyagawa composed The Peanuts&#x27; 1962 song &quot;Furimukanaide.&quot; The Peanuts also sang &quot;Mothra&#x27;s Song&quot;. The song was composed by Yuji Koseki.

In 1963, the era of former popular singers such as Hibari Misora, Chiemi Eri, Izumi Yukimura, Hachiro Kasuga, Michiya Mihashi and Frank Nagai seemed to end and Sakamoto released a Japanese hit song titled &quot;Miagete Goran Yoru no Hoshi o&quot;. In June 1963, Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;Ue o muite arukō&quot; reached the number-one position in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 under its alternative title &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;. In 1963, Kitajima&#x27;s song and Kazuo Funaki&#x27;s song also became popular. Both songs were composed by Minoru Endo. Hashi and Funaki became singers for youth music, making a new genre called .

===1963–1966: Enka&#x27;s independence and collapse===

On September 6, 1963, record label Nippon Crown became independent from the Nippon Columbia. Saburō Kitajima was its member. Hibari Misora presented a song titled &quot;Kanto Harusame Kasa&quot; when the record label was established. Kitajima took part in the Kōhaku Uta Gassen for the first time on December 31, 1963. The audience share of the 14th Kōhaku Uta Gassen reached 81.4% in 1963. In 1964, Haruo Minami released his cover version of song , composed by Masao Koga. In 1965, Kitajima released a string of hits such as , and . &quot;Kaerokana&quot; was composed by Hachidai Nakamura. Koga composed Hibari&#x27;s song &quot;Yawara&quot;, which won the grand prix award at the Japan Record Award in 1965. Koga was also an original composer of Hibari&#x27;s 1966 cover song . His music, called &quot;Koga melody&quot;, became a base of modern &quot;enka&quot; and he became known as &quot;the father of modern &quot;enka&quot;&quot;.

On the other hand, Hachidai Nakamura also composed the Johnnys&#x27; 1964 debut single &quot;Wakai Namida.&quot; Japanese guitarist Yūzō Kayama also produced his 1965 hit song &quot;Kimi to Itsumademo&quot; as a singer. British rock band The Beatles visited Japan and had a concert at the Nippon Budokan in 1966. With the aim of breaking the traditional style, Group Sounds band The Blue Comets&#x27; 1966 song , originally released as an English song, was released as a Japanese song. In 1966, folk singer Ryoko Moriyama, a daughter of jazz musician Hisashi Moriyama, also released hit song . The Blue Comets&#x27; song &quot;Blue Chateau&quot; won the grand prix award at the Japan Record Award in 1967. The Folk Crusaders&#x27; 1967 song &quot;I Only Live Twice&quot; also had a big impact on Japanese popular music. New musical movement called also a string of hits such as Ayumi Ishida&#x27;s 1968 song &quot;Blue Light Yokohama&quot;, composed by Kyohei Tsutsumi.

Group Sounds became unpopular in the late 1960s in Japan. Then, Group Sounds was displaced by &quot;New Rock&quot; in Japanese underground rock music around 1970. Japanese-language rock band Happy End became one of prototypes of modern J-pop. Mickey Curtis formed rock band &quot;Samurai&quot; in 1969 in U.K. and later scouted the Japanese band &quot;Carol&quot; in which leader was Eikichi Yazawa.

==Legacy==
A part of Ryoichi Hattori&#x27;s Western-style music during that period remained in Western-style classical music of Japan and was transvalued in 2000s. His tribute album was released on October 17, 2007. Various musicians such as Hideaki Tokunaga (for &quot;Wakare no Blues&quot;), Kazumasa Oda (for &quot;Suzhou Nocturne&quot;), Masaharu Fukuyama (for &quot;Tokyo Boogie-woogie&quot;) and Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra (for &quot;Aoi Sanmyaku&quot;) took part in the album. The tribute album debuted at the number-ten position on the Japanese Oricon weekly album charts.

<doc id="1234907" wikidata="Q6379472" url="?curid=1234907" title="Kawachi ondo">
<text>Kawachi Ondo (河内音頭) is a kind of Japanese folk song that originates from Yao City in the old Kawachi region of Japan, now part of modern-day Osaka Prefecture. This song&#x27;s style and melody are said to have evolved from another folk song called Gōshū Ondo from Shiga Prefecture, known as Goshu in earlier days. Kawachi Ondo accompanies the Bon dance (also known as Bon Odori) in the Osaka/Kawachi region of Japan, however, this song has recently grown in popularity and is often played at other major Bon dances, even in Tokyo. Emmanuelle Loubet writes that Kawachi Ondo has long had a grassroots vitality and that the Kawachi area&#x27;s association with the working class, yakuza, street fights, rough language, and Buraku communities has likely contributed to the form&#x27;s close links to community practice rather than being &quot;pasteuriz[ed] for consumption by the masses.&quot;

==Form==
&quot;Kawachi Ondo&quot; is a fluid form of traditional folk music. It has a common melody and a returning chorus, but the lyric is fluid. This folk tune is used to tell epic tales, usually about historic people, lore, and/or geography, even yakuza. It can be used to talk about current events, and expert singers are able to improvise lyrics on the spot, as well as sing words directly from a newspaper. There is varying instrumentation for Kawachi Ondo, though the staples are always a taiko drum and the shamisen. Sometimes modern instruments are used in the Kawachi Ondo ensemble, such as electric guitars and electric basses.

==Singers==
It is considered an art to be able to put lyric to Kawachi Ondo. It takes years of observation and study to become a singer. Expert singers, known as &quot;ondotori&quot;, become renowned in the area or in parts of Japan where Kawachi Ondo is famous. There is a festival called Kawachi Ondo Matsuri in Yao City, the birthplace of Kawachi Ondo. The festival celebrates the song, and a massive Bon Odori is held where many famous singers go and perform. The most famous singer of Kawachi Ondo is Kawachiya Kikusuimaru of Yao City. Koishimaru Izutsuya&#x27;s singing is featured on a UNESCO/Smithsonian Folkways recording with extensive liner notes and transcriptions of his live performance.

A Kawachi Ondo singer was traditionally accompanied by one taiko player (on an chudaiko or odaiko) and a shamisen player. Since the 1970s, the shamisen has been increasingly replaced by an electric guitar player.

==Dance==
There are many ways to dance to Kawachi Ondo. The most famous dance is called &quot;mamekachi&quot;. The dance proceeds clockwise around the yagura, though a few steps go in the opposite direction, and it is marked by a succession of three claps before the dance sequence begins again. It may be the most standard of Kawachi Ondo dances, but even this dance will vary slightly from region to region.

There is an alternate dance called &quot;teodori&quot;, literally, &quot;hand dance&quot;. Most of the movement is in the hands. In contrast, the mamekachi involves a lot of foot work. The teodori dance proceeds counter-clockwise around the yagura and the dancers clap twice before beginning the dance sequence anew. Often to change things, dancers will switch between the mamekachi and teodori dances halfway through a Kawachi Ondo performance, as performances can last up to 30 minutes or so.

Like the song Kawachi Ondo itself, the dance is ever changing and people are always coming up with new ways to dance to it. Guilds will often take an existing dance and add their own flair to it. For example, taiko troupes that decide to join in a local bon odori will often bring their bachi (drum sticks) and incorporate taiko drumming motions into the dance. Martial arts groups will incorporate chopping and kicking moves, etc. Sometimes groups may even come up with an entirely new dance altogether. Enka singer Mitsuko Nakamura is famous for singing Kawachi Ondo and a derivative of the song called Kawachi Otoko Bushi; she is credited for inventing a new Kawachi Ondo dance, and loyal fans get together and dance the &quot;Nakamura Mitsuko&quot; at bon dances.

==Goshu Ondo==
Kawachi Ondo is closely tied to Goshu Ondo, as it is said Kawachi Ondo evolved from it. The kakegoe &quot;ha iya korase dokoise&quot; is found in both songs and is well known to Japanese citizens of Osaka. As in Kawachi Ondo, the lyrics in Goshu Ondo are fluid, and it takes expertise to become a proficient singer. Singers of Kawachi Ondo are often singers of Goshu Ondo as well. In some parts of Osaka, both are sung alternatively at bon dances.

==Kakegoe==
Kawachi Ondo has two kakegoe, and they are sung at different times. They are &quot;Ha enya korase, dokkoise!&quot; and &quot;Sorya yoi, dokoi sa, sa no yoiya sansa!&quot;

&quot; However, I will do my best to sing&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; This song, Kawachi ondo&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot; Which has been sung for nearly 700 years&quot;&lt;br&gt;
:&quot; Sorya yoi dokkoisa, sa no yoiya sansa!&quot;

<text>Thomas &quot;Tom&quot; Bruce Griswold (born April 22, 1953) co-hosts the radio show &quot;The Bob &amp; Tom Show&quot; together with Chick McGee, Kristi Lee, and Josh Arnold. Co-host Bob Kevoian retired at the end of 2015. This comedy-based early morning program is among the highest rated in American radio and has been nationally syndicated since 1995. The show is broadcast from studios at WFBQ in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Radio career==
Griswold worked in radio in WETO in DeLand, Florida and WMBN and WJML in Petoskey, Michigan. While in Petoskey, Griswold met Bob Kevoian, and the duo moved to Indianapolis to launch &quot;The Bob &amp; Tom Show&quot; at WFBQ in March 1983. After 12 years of broadcasting to central Indiana, they began syndicating their show nationally on January 6, 1995.

Griswold often hosts or participates in Bob and Tom Radio: The Comedy Tour shows.

Griswold and Kevoian were inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame on November 5, 2015. The Indiana Broadcasters Association gave Griswold a Lifetime Achievement Award on October 3, 2022, during the association&#x27;s annual meeting.

==Personal life==
Griswold was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Herbert Bruce and Sally Griswold. He is a 1971 graduate of University School in Hunting Valley, Ohio and a graduate of Columbia University with a degree in Literature. Griswold is the father of seven children, including three boys and four girls. His children are Sam, Willie, Lucy, Charlie, Sally, Finley and Hart Griswold. At age 4, Finley recovered from emergency surgery to remove a benign brain tumor. Charlie, 27, died suddenly on July 29, 2022.

Griswold&#x27;s sister is model Janet Griswold de Villeneuve; his nieces are Daisy and Poppy de Villeneuve.

In July 2009, Griswold was hospitalized for nearly a week due to a broken right arm (humerus bone) and a shoulder injury he suffered after falling from a motorcycle. The injury required surgery that included numerous screws and a plate in his arm. He returned to the air on July 30, 2009.

Griswold was hospitalized for heart valve replacement surgery for several days during August 2021. Doctors had initially planned to perform a valve repair operation but determined that a valve replacement &quot;would provide a better long term outcome.&quot; Griswold resumed broadcasting on September 13, 2021.

Griswold and fellow &quot;Bob and Tom Show&quot; cast members occasionally encourage listeners to make charitable contributions. Griswold has supported the Miracle Ride and Riley Children&#x27;s Foundation, the charitable arm of Riley Hospital for Children.

==Television==
&quot;The Bob and Tom Show&quot;, a one-hour video version of the four-hour radio show featuring clips from that morning&#x27;s broadcast, debuted on WGN America in November 2008 and ran weeknights until its cancellation in September 2010.

A newer, 30-minute &quot;Bob and Tom&quot; television show aired weeknights and late Saturday evenings from October 5, 2020, through January 8, 2022, on MyIndy-TV 23 (WNDY-TV, Indianapolis). A 20-minute version of &quot;Bob and Tom Tonight&quot; continues to be posted at 8 p.m. (Eastern Time) weekdays on YouTube and Facebook.

<text>Jean-Marc Gounon (born 1 January 1963) is a French racing driver. He raced in Formula One in and , participating in a total of 9 Grands Prix and scoring no championship points. He is the father of fellow racing driver Jules Gounon.

==Career==
After winning the French Formula 3 Championship in 1989, Gounon moved into International Formula 3000 in 1990. He was the only man to win F3000 races in a non-Reynard in 1991 and 1992, in a RALT and Lola respectively. He also became known for his quick starts, and might have had another win at Enna in 1991, but was controversially adjudged to have jumped the start in the era before electronic detection.

In 1993 Gounon was originally signed to drive in F1 for March but the team collapsed at the start of the season. He later bought a two-race deal with Minardi after Christian Fittipaldi was dropped but he finished neither race, being withdrawn at Suzuka and spinning off in the season-closer, Adelaide&#x27;s 1993 Australian Grand Prix.

The next year Gounon benefited from Andrea Montermini having broken his leg, and finished 9th for Simtek at his home race, France (Simtek&#x27;s joint best ever result). He raced in seven grands prix that season and qualified for all of them, being finally replaced after the Portuguese Grand Prix by the better-funded Domenico Schiattarella, ending his F1 career.

Later in his career he went on to drive sports cars.

<text>Jesús Ricardo Iglesias (February 22, 1922, in Pergamino – July 11, 2005, in Pergamino), was a racing driver from Argentina. He initially competed with some success in long distance races in Argentina with a Chevrolet Special, before being invited to drive one of the works Gordini Type 16s in the 1955 Argentine Grand Prix. He qualified 17th out of 22 competitors, but had to retire on lap 38 due to transmission failure, although he also seemed to be on the brink of exhaustion because of the boiling heat.

After that Iglesias went back to endurance racing, in which he competed solely in Argentinian races. He had his best result in the Rafaela 500-mile race in 1956, where he took second place in his Chevrolet Special car.

<doc id="1234926" wikidata="Q78581" url="?curid=1234926" title="Jo Gartner">
<text>Josef Anton Gartner (24 January 1954 – 1 June 1986) was a Formula One and sports car endurance driver from Austria. After a successful lower formula career, including a win in the Formula Two Pau Grand Prix, he participated in eight Formula One Grands Prix for Osella during the 1984 season, scoring no points. He was killed in an accident at the 1986 24 Hours of Le Mans.

==Career==

===Early career===
Gartner was born in Vienna. In 1972, he began working for the Kaimann Formula Super Vee team in a technical capacity. After buying, modifying and selling a Formula Vee chassis of his own, Gartner began his motor sport career in some hillclimbing events in 1976. In 1977, aged 23, he started competing more seriously, driving in the Volkswagen-supported European Formula Super Vee championship. The following season he finished third in the championship.

He moved up to the European Formula Three Championship in 1979, driving a Martini with support from Renault, and switched to Formula Two in 1980 with a two-year-old March. On his Formula Two debut, Gartner&#x27;s car was damaged by debris from the accident that killed his countryman Markus Höttinger. He was subsequently invited to take Höttinger&#x27;s place in the BMW M1 Procar Championship series, in which he raced against Formula One drivers, driving for fellow Austrian Helmut Marko.

In 1981, Gartner drove a year-old Toleman TG280 at selected races and picked up a point with sixth place at the Enna-Pergusa round. He finished the season with two races for the Merzario team, finishing eighth at Mantorp Park. Continuing with Merzario for 1982, Gartner picked up his only point of the season with sixth at the opening round at Silverstone, but the car was generally uncompetitive in a strong field.

For 1983, Gartner decided to return to running his own car, an ex-works Spirit 201. After a fourth place at Hockenheim, he won the Pau Grand Prix when the first driver across the line, Alain Ferté, was disqualified because his car was underweight. This win enabled Gartner to gain the necessary sponsorship for a move to Formula One.

===Formula One===
In 1984, Gartner had secured the part-time second seat with the struggling Italian Osella team, as teammate to Piercarlo Ghinzani, driving a year-old, non-turbo FA1E. He qualified on his debut at the 1984 San Marino Grand Prix, but his race ended with an engine failure. At his next race, Gartner was given the new turbocharged Osella FA1F as the team decided to run a second car at all the remaining races. At the 1984 British Grand Prix, Gartner was allowed to start in 27th position because the Tyrrell Racing team was participating under appeal. However, his race ended when he was unable to avoid a first-lap accident involving Philippe Alliot and Eddie Cheever. After mechanical failures in the next two races, he finished 12th at the Dutch Grand Prix, five laps down on the winner Alain Prost.

At the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Gartner qualified 24th but finished fifth, beating fellow Austrian Gerhard Berger into sixth after Ghinzani and Cheever ran out of fuel. However, Gartner was denied the two points normally awarded to the fifth-place finisher, as Osella had only entered one car at the beginning of the season. Berger in sixth was similarly denied his single point, driving for ATS.

Classified 12th at the European Grand Prix although he retired with fuel injection problems, Gartner closed the season with a 16th place classification in Portugal, having run out of fuel. For 1985, he was in contention for a seat at Arrows, but lost out to Berger. He also held talks with Toleman and Osella, but both seats went to drivers with more finance in place.

===Endurance racing===
Gartner had finished fourth in the 1985 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Porsche 962C along with teammates David Hobbs and Guy Edwards. In 1985, after his season in Formula One, he joined the Fitzpatrick Porsche Group C endurance racing team, driving a Porsche 956, and also campaigned a Porsche 962 for Bob Akin in the IMSA GT Championship. He won the 1986 12 Hours of Sebring, along with teammates Akin and Hans-Joachim Stuck, finishing on three wheels, and also won an international race at Thruxton with Tiff Needell. Gartner was aiming to join the factory Rothman&#x27;s Porsche team for 1987.

Whilst contesting the 1986 24 Hours of Le Mans for Kremer Racing with teammates Sarel van der Merwe and Kunimitsu Takahashi, Gartner&#x27;s Porsche 962 suffered a mechanical failure at 2:10 am on the Sunday morning, and turned hard left into the barriers on the Mulsanne Straight at . The car somersaulted down the track, hit a telephone pole, crashed into trees and then caught fire after it came to a rest on top of the barriers on the opposite side of the track. The accident took out 100 meters of guardrail and debris was strewn over 200 meters. Gartner was killed on impact, due to a broken neck. Although the cause of the accident was never determined, two marshals saw Gartner brake on the straight before the car veered off into the barriers. Gartner was the last fatality at the Le Mans 24 Hours under race conditions until Allan Simonsen was killed in the 2013 race.

<doc id="1234928" wikidata="Q2096209" url="?curid=1234928" title="Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya">
<text>Al-Barāhīn al-Ahmadīyyah &#x27;alā Haqīqatu Kitāb Allāh al-Qur&#x27;ān wa&#x27;n-Nabūwwatu al-Muhammadīyyah (Ahmadiyya Arguments in Support of the Book of Allah - the Qur&#x27;an, and the Prophethood of Muhammad) is a five-part book written by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement. The first two parts were published in 1880 CE, the third volume was published in 1882, the fourth volume in 1884 and the fifth volume in 1905. In writing the book, Ghulam Ahmad sought to rejuvenate Islam by arguing for the validity of its principles and vindicating its teachings in response to Christian and Hindu polemics against Islam as well as atheistic philosophies. In this context, a significant portion of the subject matter of the book is dedicated to the defence of Islam as a whole against the criticism of Muhammad, the Qur&#x27;an and Islam that was raised in the 18th and 19th centuries predominantly by Christian missionaries and Hindu revivalists.

Along with the publication of the book, Ghulam Ahmad issued a poster advertising a reward of 10,000 rupees (the total value of his property in 1879) for anyone who could rebut his arguments in favor of the divine nature of the Quran and the authenticity of Muhammad&#x27;s claim to prophethood; or could present at the very least one-fifth of the &#x27;excellences&#x27; as presented in the &quot;Barāhīn&quot; in favour of Islam, in favour of their own religion, scripture and founder(s).

The work was initially intended to be a fifty-volume series in the defence of Islam, however, Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s claim to be divinely appointed as the expected Mahdi and Messiah during the course of its writing and following the publication of volume four marked a major turning point in his life. The series thus ended with the fifth volume. The &quot;Barāhīn&quot; proved to be a useful source for the defence of Islamic doctrine and was critically acclaimed by many Indian Muslim scholars at the time, earning Ghulam Ahmad recognition as an expert in formulating arguments against Christians and Hindus among the intellectual circles of the Punjab. However, other aspects of the work proved highly controversial within the Muslim community itself because of the author&#x27;s messianic claims and his claim to be a recipient of revelation.

==The Conditions for the Challenge==
In the announcement contained in part one, Ghulam Ahmad sets out the form, conditions and criteria of the challenge and offers a reward of 10,000 rupees (total value of the author&#x27;s property) to the respondent, provided that three judges agreed upon by both parties, &#x27;unanimously give the verdict that the conditions&#x27; have been met.
*Anyone from the &#x27;various religions and creeds&#x27; is invited to prove that their holy books are equal in status to the Qur&#x27;an by presenting such arguments in support of and derived purely from their central scriptures, as the author has done from the Qur&#x27;an in support of its truth and that of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.
*If one is unable to advance the same number of arguments as he has, then one may produce half, or one-third, or one-fourth, or one-fifth of them or at the least refute his arguments one by one.
*The permission to advance up to one fifth of the arguments does not pertain to the total number of arguments but rather to each &quot;category of arguments&quot; that is, (a) arguments based on the &#x27;inherent excellences&#x27; or internal evidence of the truth of the holy scripture and that of the religion&#x27;s founder; and (b) arguments based on external evidence, upon &#x27;objective facts and established, recurrent events&#x27;. These two categories are further divided into the &#x27;simple argument&#x27; and the &#x27;composite argument&#x27;, the former being that which is independently and in itself sufficient evidence of divine origin and truth; the latter that whose validity requires a set of mutually dependent arguments.

*If he is unable to advance arguments from his own scripture or present even one fifth of the arguments in accordance with the conditions then he must acknowledge by a written submission that the &#x27;inadequacy and irrationality of his scripture has rendered him incapable of fulfilling this clause.&#x27;

==Contents==

The first and second volumes are largely introductory in their nature and present an outline of the book. Ghulam Ahmad listed six points to which the book adheres.
===Part III===
*It contains all the truths based on the principles of the knowledge of religion; all the truths put together can be called Islam
*It is claimed to contain 300 arguments for truth of Islam
*It contains answers to the allegations, accusations, objections and whimsical views of the opponents of Islam, like Jews, Christians, Magians, Aryas, Brahmins, Naturalists, Atheists, idol worshippers and non-religious people.
*It contains a discussion on the basic religious beliefs of other religions.
*It contains the explanation of the secrets of the word of God. The wisdom of the Quran becomes manifest throughout.
*All the discussions have been penned with great coolness and fineness and in perfect accordance with the rules of discussion; everything has been said in a lucid manner and understanding has been made easy.
In the third volume Ghulam Ahmad laments at the poor condition and plight of the Muslims and has shown great concern for them. The subject of external and internal proofs of the truth and excellences of the Quran (قرﺁن) are dealt with at length.

===Part IV===
The fourth volume discusses the need for the word of God (revelation). The excellence and uniqueness of Al-Fatiha (opening chapter of the Qur&#x27;an) and other verses of the Quran are discussed. A comparison is made between the teachings of the Quran and those of the New Testament. It also compares the nature of God as presented in the Vedas arguing that they do not address the idea of God&#x27;s oneness and leave the concept of God unclear, open and miscible. Certain prophecies are made of which many people were told of beforehand. The miracles of Jesus, the meaning and nature of salvation and how it can be attained are also discussed.

Towards the end of this volume, Ghulam Ahmad claimed that he had received a sudden manifestation of God, the like of which had been received by Moses and that God addressed him saying &quot;Verily I am your Lord&quot;. Thereafter he was made aware of such secrets of &#x27;spiritual heights&#x27; as could not be comprehended merely by human wit and intelligence. With this he declared that he no longer had any control over this book, but that it was God alone who knew how it would proceed.

===Part V===
This volume starts with a description of what constitutes a true and living religion and stresses the point that mere stories and legends of ancient times are not enough to establish the truth of a religion, it must have the continued miraculous manifestation of the words and deeds of the Almighty God up to the present. Any religion that is not true and is not living will certainly be devoid of these manifestations. He then continues to explain what a miracle really is and why it is essential for miracles to take place. He adds that living miracles and signs and not merely the stories of bygone ages are the sure sign of a living religion.

An extended supplement is attached to this volume. Ghulam Ahmad explains the unusual delay of 23 years to write the 5th Part (1905) of &quot;Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya&quot;; after the initial four parts (1884), during which period he wrote more than 80 other books. Ahmad explains that the delay was the Will of God, so that many of the Revelations, he received 23 years earlier and published in the initial parts, would have been fulfilled. He answers objections raised by some people; the death of Jesus is also dealt with in the light of verses of the Quran. After the supplement, Ghulam Ahmad intended to add an epilogue, the notes of which have been added. These notes explain what Islam really is according to Ghulam Ahmad, an explanation of the teachings of the Quran and the fulfillment of promises that he claimed God had made with him.

The fifth volume of the &quot;Barahin&quot; ends with an explanation of certain revelations which Ghulam Ahmad claimed to have received in which he was addressed as Jesus. About his claim he states (with which ends the fifth volume):

==Translations==
The book was written largely in Urdu. Since 2018 all five parts of &quot;Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya&quot; have been translated into English, German and Arabic by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Parts III, IV, and V have been partially translated into English by the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam.

<doc id="1234929" wikidata="Q171786" url="?curid=1234929" title="Jo Schlesser">
<text>Joseph Théodule Marie Schlesser (18 May 1928 – 7 July 1968) was a French Formula One and sports car racing driver. He participated in three World Championship Grands Prix, including the 1968 French Grand Prix in which he was killed. He scored no championship points. He was the uncle of Jean-Louis Schlesser who himself became a Formula One driver in the 1980s.

==Early career==
Schlesser began his motor sport career in 1952, when he rallied a Panhard before, in 1954, trying the then popular French class of racing known as Monomill. His career was then interrupted for three years whilst he was working in Mozambique but he returned to Europe in 1957 when he finished second in the Rome–Liège–Rome Rally in a Mercedes. He then raced a Ferrari 250 GT but without much success until 1960 when he finished second in class at the Nürburgring 1000 km and second overall at Rouen. He also raced a Cooper in Formula Two in 1960 but only achieved a sixth place at Syracuse. In 1961 his season was cut short by an accident at Le Mans but he returned in 1962 with a Formula Junior Brabham.

In 1964 Schlesser moved to the new one-litre Formula Two and became a highly regarded competitor in European Formula Two in the pre-European Formula Two Championship era. In 1966 he joined the works Matra Formula Two team and continued with the same team as Ford France in 1967. In 1968 he joined his close friend Guy Ligier to race McLarens.

Jo Schlesser also raced in NASCAR, finishing 13th in the 1964 Daytona 500 as a teammate to Ned Jarrett.

== Formula Two ==

Schlesser participated in the 1966 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring with a Formula Two (F2) specification Matra MS5-BRM 1.0 litre and again in 1967 at the same venue with an F2 Matra MS5-Cosworth 1.6 litre. In 1966, he finished 10th in the overall classification and third in the Formula Two classification. In 1967, he was forced to retire with a clutch problem after two laps.

== Formula One and Death ==

An opportunity for a Formula One seat came for Schlesser in the 1968 with Honda. The Honda team had completed an experimental air-cooled Formula One car (the RA302) which had been tested by their works driver John Surtees. Surtees pronounced it as not ready for racing, and a potential deathtrap. Undaunted, and with the financial help of Honda France, Honda entered it for the French Grand Prix at Rouen. Being the local hero, Schlesser was hired to drive it.
After two laps, the car slid wide at the &quot;Six Frères&quot; corner and crashed sideways into a bank. The magnesium-bodied Honda and 58 laps&#x27; worth of fuel ignited instantly, leaving Schlesser no chance of survival. As a result, Honda withdrew from Formula One at the end of the 1968 season after Surtees had again refused to drive the car in the Italian Grand Prix.

== Legacy ==

Guy Ligier, a close friend, former teammate and business partner, established his company Ligier Cars shortly after Schlesser&#x27;s death, in fulfillment of the dream that they had shared, to build a &quot;good car&quot;.
Ligier cars would receive type designators beginning with &quot;JS&quot; as a tribute to Schlesser. This tradition is being continued by Onroak, the current owner of Ligier Cars. Italian company Dallara would later adopt this style of nomenclature for their 2012 IndyCar entry by naming it after the new car&#x27;s test driver Dan Wheldon, who had died in the final race of the new car&#x27;s predecessor.

His nephew, Jean-Louis Schlesser, would also become a successful racing driver. He started in one Formula One Grand Prix, won the World Sportscar Championship and the Paris–Dakar Rally twice (1999 and 2000).

<text>Joseph Vonlanthen (born 31 May 1942) is a former racing driver from Switzerland. He participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, on 17 August 1975, driving a Williams. He retired with engine failure, scoring no championship points.

Vonlanthen started in Formula Vee, before progressing to Formula Three, where he won the Swiss Formula 3 Championship. He found things a little tougher in Formula Two, but managed to secure a seat with Frank Williams for the non-championship Swiss Grand Prix in 1975, where he finished 14th. He also made a World Championship start in the 1975 Austrian Grand Prix. Vonlanthen can be considered lucky to have started this race, as he was only allowed to start when Wilson Fittipaldi suffered an injury in practice which prevented him from taking his place on the grid.

He subsequently returned to Formula 2 before disappearing from the sport&#x27;s higher levels.

<text>Joseph Michael Kelly (13 March 1913 – 28 November 1993) was an Irish racing driver and businessman, who entered into the 1950 and 1951 British Grand Prix. 

==Biography==
===Racing career===
By profession Kelly was a motor dealer from Dublin and he used the profits from this business to indulge his interest in motorsport. He raced a Maserati 6CM on 20 August 1949, during the 1949 BRDC International Trophy meeting at Silverstone Circuit. It was the first race meeting to use the former airfield&#x27;s perimeter roadways, rather than the main runways. The event was held that day over two heats of 20 laps and one final of 30 laps of the Grand Prix circuit. The final was won by Italian Alberto Ascari driving a Ferrari; Ascari would go on to win the Formula One World Championship twice. The race meeting was marred by the death of St. John Horsfall in an accident during the final race.

In 1950, Kelly – using his own Alta GP car, the last built – participated in the 1950 and 1951 British rounds of the Formula One World Championship. He was not classified in the results of either race, scoring no championship points and his best grid position was 18th place, but his persistence with the Alta GP car paid off in 1952 with third place in the Ulster Trophy at Dundrod. His Alta was later modified to accept a naturally aspirated Bristol straight-6 engine to become the &quot;Irish Racing Automobile&quot;. He also owned and raced a Jaguar C-Type sports car which he raced in Ireland at &quot;The Curragh&quot;, known throughout the world as the home of Irish horse racing, and could also boast of having no less than two motor racing circuits in the late 1940s and early fifties. Known as the &quot;Short&quot; circuit and the &quot;Big&quot; circuit, both played host to great entries and attracted huge crowds. The Short circuit was first used in 1947 and catered for both car and motorcycle events. It was used until the late fifties, whereas the &quot;Big&quot; circuit was the venue for the famous International Wakefield Trophy car races which were held annually from 1949 to 1954. At a June meeting the lap record was broken by Kelly, this time driving a Maserati. This was the first purpose-built racing car to compete at the Curragh. Up until then the entries consisted mostly of MGs and home or garage built &quot;specials&quot;. The crowd had become a great fan of Kelly and he certainly gave them a demonstration of high speed racing that day. The record which he set that day was to remain unbroken until 1954, when he again shattered it by almost 10 mph, this time in a Ferrari sports car.

His own full-time driving career came to an end in 1955, following a serious accident at the Oulton Park circuit. However, he did compete in some hill climbs in later life driving Porsche and Ferrari sports cars, at Wicklow in Ireland. His Jaguar C-Type is still raced in historic meetings around the world, as is his Ferrari Monza.

===Business life===


Kelly was first a businessman; his racing took second place to making money. His car dealing and property trading came high on his list of priorities; he owned many very famous homes during his property dealing days in the 1970s and 80&#x27;s in Ireland and England. He was very well known in his native Dublin. He hit the Irish Press in the Fifties due to being the first Irishman to get a royal invitation to the first British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Following his withdrawal from racing, Kelly concentrated on his business interests, which included the Irish Ferrari concession.

===Collections and later life===
After 1955 and the crash at Oulton Park, Kelly worked on building up car showrooms in
England, then in 1969 sold them all and decided to move back to Athy, Ireland.
This is where he started his property portfolio which resulted in Kelly owning some
of the most impressive estates in the country, including Old Conna Hill near Dublin.

In the late 1970s and 80s Kelly started a collection of rare and expensive cars which included
Lamborghini, Ferrari and Rolls-Royce.

Whilst he spent most of his life in Ireland, Kelly died in Neston, Cheshire, England.

<text>Riverside Church is an interdenominational church in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City, United States. The church is associated with the American Baptist Churches USA and the United Church of Christ. It was conceived by philanthropist businessman and Baptist John D. Rockefeller Jr. in conjunction with Baptist minister Harry Emerson Fosdick as a large, interdenominational church in Morningside Heights, which is surrounded by academic institutions.

The church occupies the block bounded by Riverside Drive, Claremont Avenue, 120th Street, and 122nd Street near Columbia University&#x27;s Morningside Heights campus and across from Grant&#x27;s Tomb. The original building opened in 1930; it was designed by Henry C. Pelton and Allen &amp; Collens in the Neo-Gothic style. It contains a nave consisting of five architectural bays; a chancel at the front of the nave; a 22-story, tower above the nave; a narthex and chapel; and a cloistered passageway that connects to the eastern entrance on Claremont Avenue. Near the top of the tower is the church&#x27;s main feature, a 74-bell carillon—the heaviest in the world—dedicated to Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s mother Laura Spelman Rockefeller. A seven-story wing was built to the south of the original building in 1959 to a design by Collens, Willis &amp; Beckonert, and was renamed for Martin Luther King Jr. in 1985. The Stone Gym to the southeast, built in 1915 as a dormitory, was designed by Louis E. Jallade and was converted to a gymnasium in 1962.

Riverside Church has been a focal point of global and national activism since its inception, and it has a long history of social justice in adherence to Fosdick&#x27;s original vision of an &quot;interdenominational, interracial, and international&quot; church. Its congregation includes members of more than forty ethnic groups. The church was designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2000 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.
== History ==
=== Context ===
==== Congregation ====
Several small Baptist congregations, including the Mulberry Street Baptist Church that was established in 1823 by a group of 16 congregants, were founded in Manhattan after the American Revolutionary War. The Mulberry Street church occupied at least three locations in the Lower East Side and two locations on Broadway in Midtown Manhattan before moving to a more permanent site at Fifth Avenue and 46th Street in the 1860s. The businessman William Rockefeller was the first of several Rockefeller family members to attend the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church; he became a major financial backer of the church in the 1870s. William and his brother John D. Rockefeller later became trustees of the church and many of its services were held at the Rockefellers&#x27; home nearby.

Cornelius Woelfkin, who became the church&#x27;s minister in 1912, started leading the church in a more modernist direction. By the early 20th century, Fifth Avenue was experiencing increased commercial development and the church building became dilapidated. The congregation sold its old headquarters in 1919 and bought land at Park Avenue and 63rd Street the following year. John Rockefeller&#x27;s son John D. Rockefeller Jr. funded half of the projected $1 million cost. The new church, which was dubbed the &quot;Little Cathedral&quot;, was designed by Henry C. Pelton in partnership with Francis R. Allen and Charles Collens. The final service in the Fifth Avenue location was held on April 3, 1922, and the renamed Park Avenue Baptist Church held its first class in the new location the next week.

==== Progressive ideology ====
In 1924, John D. Rockefeller Jr. donated $500,000 to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights, which was further uptown from the Park Avenue location, in an unsuccessful attempt to influence the cathedral&#x27;s ideology in a progressive direction. The following January, Harry E. Edmonds—leader of the International House in Morningside Heights for whose construction Rockefeller had provided funds—wrote to Rockefeller to propose creating a new church in the neighborhood. Edmonds suggested progressive pastor Harry Emerson Fosdick should head such a church. Rockefeller then told the Park Avenue Baptist Church&#x27;s leaders about the plan and hired an agent to inspect the planned church site.

Woelfkin quit in mid-May 1925 and Rockefeller Jr. immediately started looking for a new minister, ultimately deciding on Fosdick, who had declined Rockefeller&#x27;s offers several times, saying he did not &quot;want to be known as the pastor of the richest man in the country&quot;. Fosdick stated he would accept the minister position on the conditions that the church would move to Morningside Heights, follow a policy of religious liberalism, remove the requirement for members to be baptized, and become nondenominational. At the end of May 1925, Fosdick agreed to become minister of the Park Avenue Baptist Church. Only fifteen percent of congregants voted against Fosdick&#x27;s appointment.

Under Fosdick&#x27;s leadership, the congregation doubled in size by 1930. The new members were diverse; of the 158 people who joined in the year after Fosdick became minister, about half were not Baptists. Though some existing congregants had doubts about whether the Park Avenue Baptist Church should move from its recently completed edifice, the church&#x27;s board, which was in favor of the relocation, stated congregants would not have to pay any of the costs for the new church.

=== Planning and construction ===
==== Site selection ====

Morningside Heights, where the new church was to be located, was being quickly developed as a residential neighborhood surrounded by numerous higher-education institutions, including Union Theological Seminary and International House of New York. The development had been spurred by the presence of Riverside Park and Riverside Drive nearby, as well as the construction of the New York City Subway&#x27;s Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line—the modern-day —under Broadway. Rockefeller briefly considered a location on Morningside Drive on the eastern edge of Morningside Heights, between 117th and 118th Streets. He ultimately chose a larger site at the southeastern corner of Riverside Drive and 122nd Street on the neighborhood&#x27;s western border, which overlooked Riverside Park to the west and Claremont Park to the north. Rockefeller felt the Riverside Drive site was more easily visible because it abutted the Hudson River and would be seen by recreational users of Riverside Drive.

In May 1925, Rockefeller finalized his purchase of the new church&#x27;s site at Riverside Drive. That July, he exchanged his previous purchase of a plot on Morningside Drive for another plot on Riverside Drive. Shortly afterward, he acquired yet more land, after which he had a frontage of on Riverside Drive for the new church. At the time of the acquisition, three apartment buildings and two mansions occupied the church&#x27;s future site. Rockefeller wished to keep the apartments in place for several years to fund the church&#x27;s eventual construction.

==== Planning ====
Rockefeller was the chairman of the committee tasked with developing a new building for the church. Hoping to avoid publicity, rather than host an architectural competition, he privately asked several architectural firms to submit plans for the building. Rockefeller tried to downplay his role in the planning and construction process, asking for his name to be omitted from media reports and discussion of the church, though with little success. His role in the selection process raised concerns from church trustees, including Fosdick, who believed such close financial involvement could place the church in &quot;a very vulnerable position&quot;. John Roach Straton, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church on 57th Street in Midtown Manhattan, criticized Rockefeller&#x27;s involvement and mockingly suggested it be called the Socony Church after the oil company the Rockefellers headed. George S. Chappell, writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;T-Square&quot;, said the project &quot;was known to most secular minds as the Rockefeller Cathedral&quot;.

Neither Rockefeller nor Fosdick had strict requirements for the church&#x27;s architectural style. Rockefeller asked for the new building to include space for the Park Avenue Baptist Church&#x27;s carillon, which he had donated. Most of the plans entailed a church facing 122nd Street and wrapping around the existing apartment buildings on the site. The exception was a plan by Allen &amp; Collens and Henry C. Pelton—who had designed Park Avenue Baptist Church—that called for a Gothic Revival church with its main entrance on the side, facing Riverside Drive, with a bell tower and apartment towers for the neighboring Union Theological Seminary. The building committee removed the apartment towers from the church plan and Allen, Collens, and Pelton were selected to design the new church in February 1926. As part of the plans, there would be a —later —bell tower, a 2,400-seat auditorium, and athletic rooms. The building would occupy a by lot. There was no room for a chapel in the original plans so Rockefeller proposed trading land with the Union Theological Seminary. In May 1926, Rockefeller gave Union an apartment building on 99 Claremont Avenue, to the northeast of the church. In exchange, Riverside Church received a small plot to its south, allowing for the construction of the chapel and a proposed cloister passage to Claremont Avenue.

Rockefeller chose to delay the construction process until the leases of the site&#x27;s existing tenants expired in October 1926. The official plans were filed with the New York City Department of Buildings in November that year. The following month, the congregation voted to approve the building plans at a cost of $4 million. Pelton and Collens then went to France to look for churches upon which to model Riverside Church&#x27;s design. They eventually selected the 13th-century Chartres Cathedral as their model.

==== Construction ====

Marc Eidlitz &amp; Son, Inc. was hired as the contractor for the construction of the new Riverside Drive church. On November 21, 1927, the church&#x27;s ceremonial cornerstone was laid, marking the start of construction. The cornerstone included items such as Woelfkin&#x27;s Bible and &quot;New York Times&quot; articles about the new church. The Park Avenue church building and three adjacent rowhouses was sold for $1.5 million in April 1928. The same month, Park Avenue Baptist Church&#x27;s official monthly newsletter announced its existing 53-bell carillon would be expanded to 72 bells upon its relocation to Riverside Drive, making it the largest set of bells in the world.

In late 1928, three fires occurred after wooden scaffolding around the new church was ignited. On December 22, 1928, one of these fires caused $1 million in damage and almost completely destroyed the interior, though the exterior remained mostly intact. Much of the damage was covered by an insurance policy placed on the building. Shortly after the December 1928 fire, Rockefeller announced he would continue with construction after insurance claims were settled. The fire delayed the completion of the interior by six months. In February 1929, the congregation began seeking donations to continue construction; Rockefeller donated $1.5 million, which when combined with the proceeds from the sale of the Park Avenue building, provided $3 million in funds. Construction of a mortuary at the Riverside Drive church was approved in March 1929. While construction was ongoing, the congregation temporarily relocated to Temple Beth-El on Fifth Avenue and 76th Street for nine months starting in July 1929.

The first portion of the new church building to be completed, the assembly hall under the auditorium, opened in October 1929. That December, Fosdick formally filed plans to rename the church from &quot;Park Avenue Baptist Church&quot; to &quot;Riverside Church&quot;. The bell was hoisted to the top of the tower&#x27;s carillon in early September 1930, the tower was completed later that month, and the first Sunday school class was held there on September 29. The church was completed on October 5, the same day the first service was held in the altar; it was attended by 3,200 people. All of the space in the nave and basement was filled and thousands more people wished to enter. The next month, officials received two oil paintings from Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s collection. The first officers of Riverside Church were elected in December 1930 and the church was formally dedicated with an interdenominational service two months later. The total cost of construction was estimated at $4 million. In the early years of the new building, journalists often referred to the church in association with either Rockefeller—who sought to reduce emphasis on his role at the church—or Fosdick. Riverside Church&#x27;s completion sharply contrasted with the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, which remained incomplete after almost four decades. Allen &amp; Collens&#x27;s plan was described by architect Robert A. M. Stern as the culmination of a &quot;craving for a tall cathedral among people of everyday tall ideas&quot;, which had started when St. John&#x27;s was proposed in 1889.

Despite the completion of Riverside Church, Rockefeller felt the surroundings still needed to be improved. In 1932, he announced he would pay for a $350,000 landscaping of the adjacent, decrepit Sakura Park. Rockefeller hired the Olmsted Brothers to renovate the park and the project was completed two years later. When Union Theological Seminary announced it would build a new apartment building at 99 Claremont Avenue. Rockefeller offered to exchange his neighboring apartment building at 122nd Street and Claremont Avenue for the lots south of the church, which were owned by the seminary. The land was swapped in 1931 after Rockefeller offered to finance part of the dormitory&#x27;s construction. In 1935, the land under the church was deeded to Rockefeller and he purchased a lot at Riverside Drive and 122nd Street from St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, after which he owned all of the land along the eastern side of Riverside Drive between 120th and 122nd Streets. Rockefeller spent a total of $10.5 million on land acquisition and church construction.

=== Use ===
==== 1930s through mid-1960s ====

The completion of the new church building at Morningside Heights resulted in a steady increase in the congregation&#x27;s membership. By May 1946, the congregation had 3,500 members, an increase of 800 in twenty years. According to a brochure issued by the church, &quot;soon every room ... was in use seven days a week&quot;, and enrollment at the church&#x27;s Sunday school had correspondingly increased.

Riverside Church became a community icon and a religious center of Morningside Heights. By 1939, the church had more than 200 staff in both part-time and full-time positions, and over 10,000 people a week were attending its social and religious services, athletic events, and employment programs. In addition to its well-attended Sunday morning service, Riverside Church hosted Communion services every first Sunday afternoon, as well as Ministry of Music services on other Sunday afternoons. The Riverside Guild, the young-adult fellowship, held worship services during Sunday evenings. Weddings and funerals were also hosted at the church. In 1942, the United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen&#x27;s School at Columbia started using Riverside Church for services, drawing 2,000 attendees on average, and continued to hold its services at the church until October 1945.

In June 1945, Fosdick announced he would step down as senior minister the following May. This spurred a search for a new pastor and in March 1946, Robert James McCracken was chosen for the position and officially became the senior pastor of Riverside Church that October. Fosdick and McCracken held each other in mutual respect so the transition between ministers went smoothly. Over the next two decades, McCracken continued Fosdick&#x27;s policy of religious liberalism. In 1956, halfway through McCracken&#x27;s tenure, the church conducted an internal report and found the organizational structure was disorganized and that most staff did not feel any single person was in charge. As a result, six councils were created and placed under the purview of the deacons and trustees. The councils partitioned power into &quot;a series of mini-kingdoms&quot;, according to a later pastor, Ernest T. Campbell.

Construction on the Martin Luther King Jr. Wing, to the south of the existing church, started in 1955. The seven-story wing was designed by Collens, Willis &amp; Beckonert, successors to Allen &amp; Collens; its $15 million cost was funded by Rockefeller. The wing was dedicated in December 1959 and contained additional facilities for the church&#x27;s programs. A dummy antenna had been placed on top of Riverside Church&#x27;s -tall carillon earlier that year to determine whether it could be used by Columbia University&#x27;s radio station, WKCR (89.9 MHz FM), despite strong opposition from parishioners and the local community. Nevertheless, the church decided to place an antenna atop the carillon for its own radio station, the top of the antenna being above ground level. Riverside Church started operating the radio station WRVR (106.7 MHz FM) in 1961 and continued to operate it until 1976. In 1960, Riverside Church&#x27;s congregation voted to join the United Church of Christ, the successor denomination to the Congregational Christian Churches. Rockefeller purchased the Stone Gym, an existing Union Theological Seminary building southeast of the original church, and reopened it as a community facility in April 1962 after a five-year renovation. In April 1967, McCracken announced he would leave his position as senior minister, citing health issues.

==== Late 1960s through 1990s ====

Ernest T. Campbell became pastor in November 1968. Less than a year later, civil rights leader James Forman interrupted a sermon at Riverside Church, citing it as one of several churches from which Black Americans could ask for reparations for slavery. This led to the church releasing its financial figures in 1970 for the first time; the figures valued the building at $86 million and the total financial endowment of $18 million, as well as the creation of a $450,000 Fund for Social Justice to disburse reparations over three years. Following a 1972 metropolitan mission study, several ministries aimed toward ameliorating social conditions in the New York City area were formed at Riverside Church. Campbell&#x27;s tenure was marked by several controversial sermons and increasing conflicts among the church&#x27;s boards, councils, and staff. In June 1976, Campbell suddenly resigned, having felt his style of leadership was not sufficient to reconcile these disagreements. The same month saw the installment of the church&#x27;s first female pastor, Evelyn Newman.

By a vote in August 1977, William Sloane Coffin was selected as the next senior minister of Riverside Church. Coffin officiated his first service in November 1977. At this point, the congregation&#x27;s size had been declining for several years but after Coffin&#x27;s selection as senior minister, membership increased to 2,627 by the end of 1979, and total annual attendance for morning services rose from 49,902 in 1976 to 71,536 in 1978. Coffin&#x27;s tenure was also marked by theologically liberal sermons, many of which were controversial, though he was more traditional in his worship. This era also saw Channing E. Phillips, the first African-American major-party U.S. presidential nominee, being hired as minister of planning and coordination.

Coffin announced his intention to resign in July 1987 to become the president of disarmament organization SANE/Freeze, and held his last sermon that December. Riverside Church formed a committee that conducted a nationwide search for its next senior minister over the next year. In February 1989, the committee chose James A. Forbes, a professor at nearby Union Theological Seminary, for the position. The congregation voted almost unanimously to approve Forbes&#x27;s selection and he became the church&#x27;s first black senior minister. At the time, between one-fourth and one-third of the congregation was Black or Hispanic. Tensions between Forbes and executive minister David Dyson soon developed over matters including the duration of Forbes&#x27;s sermons and his musical choices. Tensions grew and a mediator was engaged after Forbes tried to fire Dyson. The dispute was resolved when Dyson resigned in October 1992.

In 1996, Riverside Church started conducting a study on the building&#x27;s current use and services, and the following October, Body Lawson, Ben Paul Associated Architects and Planners published the Riverside Church Master Plan. The plan included a major addition on Riverside Church&#x27;s eastern side, consisting of the relocation of the Claremont Avenue entrance, paving of the forecourt, reconfiguration of the cloister lobby, and construction of a seven-story building over the gymnasium. This plan was controversial among congregants, some of whom petitioned the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (NYCLPC) to designate the church to prevent the alteration of the original appearance of the Claremont Avenue entrance. In December 1998, the congregation voted to officially nominate the church for landmark status. Only the original church building was nominated; the nomination excluded the Martin Luther King Jr. Wing, despite preservationists&#x27; requests for the entire structure to be considered for landmark designation. The NYCLPC approved landmark status for the original church in May 2000.

==== 21st century ====

Two controversies involving Riverside Church arose in the early 2000s: an allegation of sexual abuse against the director of a basketball program at the church and an allegation of financial mismanagement due to a $32 million decrease in the endowment between 2000 and 2002. The accused basketball director resigned in 2002 while the accusation of financial mismanagement was prolonged through several years of court cases, although the New York Supreme Court had dismissed a lawsuit over the topic. Forbes announced his retirement in September 2006 and held his last sermon in June 2007. By that time, the church had 2,700 congregants, a large proportion of whom were black and Hispanic. The church had a $14 million annual operating budget and a paid staff of 130.

Another nationwide, year-long search for a new senior minister commenced and in August 2008, it was announced Brad Braxton had been selected as the sixth senior minister of Riverside Church. Braxton&#x27;s tenure was marked by theological disputes; congregants disagreed whether the church should take a fundamentalist or progressive position, as well as a lawsuit over his salary, which a church spokesperson stated was $457,000. In June 2009, Braxton submitted a letter of resignation due to these disputes. For the next five years, Riverside Church had no senior minister and in 2014, its congregation had decreased to 1,670, a loss of over a thousand since 2007. In 2012, the church and its annexes were listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In June 2014, Amy K. Butler was selected as the church&#x27;s seventh, and the first female, senior minister. In September 2018, the church announced it would buy the neighboring McGiffert Hall at Claremont Avenue and 122nd Street for $45 million. The dormitory was on land John Rockefeller Jr. had donated to the Union Theological Seminary, and under the donation agreement, the church had the right of first offer to buy the building should it ever be offered for sale. In July 2019, the church&#x27;s governing council announced Butler&#x27;s contract would not be renewed, and the Church Council and Butler released a joint letter stating Butler&#x27;s resignation was mutual. A former Church Council member later said Butler was dismissed after she and several other female staff members had experienced sexual harassment by another former council member, Dr. Edward Lowe. Michael E. Livingston became the interim senior minister.

== Design ==

Riverside Church occupies a lot between Riverside Drive to the west, 122nd Street to the north, Claremont Avenue to the east, and 120th Street to the south. Riverside Church&#x27;s main architects; Henry C. Pelton, Francis R. Allen, and Charles Collens; created the general plan for the church. Pelton was most involved with tactical planning while Collens was most involved with the Gothic detail. Sculptural elements were designed by Robert Garrison and constructed by local studios, including the Piccirilli Brothers. The church&#x27;s interior was designed by Burnham Hoyt. The Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) Wing to the south of the original building was designed by Collens, Willis &amp; Beckonert and the Stone Gym to the southeast was designed by Louis E. Jallade. , Riverside Church is the tallest church in the United States and is among the world&#x27;s tallest churches, with a tower rising .

Pelton and Collens chose a Gothic architectural style for Riverside Church&#x27;s exterior; by contrast, the internal structure incorporates modern curtain walls and a steel frame. Fosdick later said the exterior Gothic style is suited to &quot;make people pray&quot; and that the church had &quot;not outgrown Gothic&quot; in that regard. Riverside Church&#x27;s design is partially derived from Chartres Cathedral in France but also incorporates designs of several Gothic churches in France and Spain. Pelton and Collens said Chartres would provide the &quot;fundamental principles&quot; for the design of Riverside Church but that Riverside would have a completely different outline. The features inspired by Chartres include the detailing of the three Riverside Drive entrances and the lack of decorative elements on the facade, except for the stained glass windows on the walls and the sculptural elements around each portal. The massive single bell tower was inspired by the two western towers at Chartres. The rest of the facade consists of Indiana Limestone.

Upon Riverside Church&#x27;s completion, its design received both praise and criticism. In mid-1931, &quot;The American Architect&quot; published pieces in mid-1931 that featured a critical viewpoint from Columbia architecture professor Walter A. Taylor and a rebuttal from architect Charles Crane, who had worked on the project with Pelton. While Taylor believed the design should have been more modernist, Crane defended Pelton&#x27;s Gothic design as being &quot;fundamentally Christian&quot;. The writers of the 1939 &quot;WPA Guide to New York City&quot; said the tower&#x27;s features make the &quot;building itself seem smaller than it is, so that its scale is scarcely impressive, even when seen at close range&quot;. Other critics called the building&#x27;s exterior overly opulent; according to one critic, when considered along the progressive ideology, the Gothic design &quot;can only be interpreted as an outward confession that religion is dead&quot;. &quot;The New York Sun&quot; referred to the building as one of the &quot;most outstanding additions&quot; to New York City&#x27;s church architecture &quot;in recent years&quot;. Eric Nash, in his book &quot;Manhattan Skyscrapers&quot;, called Riverside Church &quot;Manhattan&#x27;s last great eclectic skyscraper&quot; while the &quot;AIA Guide to New York City&quot; dubbed the church &quot;easily the most prominent architectural work along the Hudson [River] from midtown to the George Washington Bridge&quot;.

=== Main building ===
Riverside Church&#x27;s main structure is centered around the nave, which is aligned on a north–south axis and is closer to Riverside Drive on the western portion of the block. The chapel and narthex are to the south, closer to 120th Street, while the chancel, which contains the altar, and the ambulatory are to the north, closer to 122nd Street.

==== Facade ====

The western facade of the church&#x27;s nave is adjacent to Riverside Drive. At the time of Riverside Church&#x27;s construction, the church did not own the lots along 120th Street to the south so the building&#x27;s three entrances are on its western side facing Riverside Drive rather than on the southern side at the back of the nave, as is customary in most churches. The entrances are atop small flights of steps leading from the street. The building&#x27;s main entrance faces west and is below the tower&#x27;s base and is accessed through a set of double wooden doors with recessed wooden panels. The figures sculpted in the concentric archivolts of the doorway represent leading religious, scientific, and philosophical figures, and an elaborate tympanum is below the arches (see ). To the south is the entrance to the narthex, which is accessed through a single door. Directly south of the narthex entrance, another double-door entrance leads to the chapel; this entrance contains two archivolts and a simpler tympanum. The northern portion of the western facade adjacent to the nave has five sets of windows (see ).

The view of the southern facade is mostly blocked by the MLK Wing to the south. The top portions of four narrow, arched stained-glass windows can be seen above the hip roof of the structure that connects the two sections. Above these stained-glass windows are three recessed, arched windows that are topped by a pediment containing a circular window.

The eastern facade also has five groupings of windows facing the nave but much of this facade is obscured by McGiffert Hall, which faces directly onto Claremont Avenue and 122nd Street. On the eastern facade of the nave is a cloistered passageway leading to Claremont Avenue (see ). Above the cloister section is a rose window.

The northern facade surrounds the chancel and ambulatory. An arched entrance called the Woman&#x27;s Porch, which contains carvings of biblical women, is in the western portion of the north facade. Above the entrance arch is an ornate belt course and nearby are two lancet windows. Another entrance is in the eastern (right) portion of the north facade. Between the two entrances is the ambulatory, with two tiers of window groupings, each with a rose window above a pair of lancet windows. The lower section has three sets of windows while the upper clerestory section has five sets of windows. Vertical buttresses, which separate each window grouping, end in finials above the roofline.

==== Nave ====

The Gothic-themed nave was inspired by Albi Cathedral, France, and measures high, wide and long. The width between the overhanging clerestory walls is . The low, wide form of the nave is inspired by those of southern French and Spanish churches. The nave has a metal roof, whose base is surrounded by a shallow arcade. The nave&#x27;s interior contains a finish of Indiana limestone, the ceilings of its vaults are lined with Guastavino terracotta tiles, and its floor is made of marble.

Three main vertical sections, which are split by buttresses, comprise the nave&#x27;s eastern and western walls, each of which has five architectural bays along the portion of the nave adjacent to the aisles; each bay contains a pointed-arch window. Above the stained-glass windows of each bay is a triforium gallery with three colonettes, followed by two adjacent lancet windows in the clerestory, and topped with a rose window. Pointed arches resting on piers that contain engaged columns support each of the clerestory bays and serve as the bases for the ribs under the vaulted ceiling. The engaged columns are surmounted by Corinthian capitals that are decorated with scenes from the Book of Jeremiah. The ceilings of the vaults underneath the triforium galleries are faced with Guastavino tile and contain lighting.
Above the clerestory, the nave&#x27;s ceiling is eight stories high. It consists of several vaults, each of which is divided into four segments by diagonally interlocking transverse ribs that do not provide structural support. Eight iron lanterns hang from the transverse ribs and descend lower than the level of the triforium gallery. The vaults contain a finish of acoustic Guastavino tiles, which are mostly gray. The tiles above the chancel and the nave&#x27;s northernmost two bays are brown because a sealant that was applied in 1953 to increase the organ&#x27;s acoustical reach has turned yellow over time.

The nave was built with a seating capacity of either 2,400, 2,408, or 2,500. The ground level contains 38 rows of oaken pews that have Gothic decoration; five additional rows of pews used to exist at the front of the nave. Two seating galleries overhang the southern portion of the nave. The lower gallery is made of carved wood, has rows of oaken pews on a downward slope, and contains a wooden ceiling with nine lamps. The upper gallery is also made of carved wood and contains oaken pews on a slope but there is no canopy above it. The upper gallery is illuminated with four lanterns that are similar to the eight above the main section of the nave. Behind the southern wall are six double-tiered niches with stone sculptures of ministers and Jacob Epstein&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot;. The Trompeta Majestatis organ stop projects from the wall beneath the niches.

==== Chancel, ambulatory, and apse ====

The chancel is directly north of the nave, slightly raised above it and separated from the nave by a limestone railing with 20 quatrefoil medallions. The western portion of the rail contains a pulpit with a wooden canopy and three carved limestone blocks. A labyrinth composed of three types of marble; it was inspired by a similar design at Chartres Cathedral and is inlaid in the middle of the chancel floor. The labyrinth is flanked on both sides are four rows of oaken choir stalls with carvings of Psalms texts. To the north, behind the choir stalls, is the organ console. A communion table made of Caen stone is near the back of the chancel in the center, behind which is a baptismal pool.

The back of the chancel contains a convex polygonal wall that includes seven bays, each with three vertical tiers that are a few feet above the corresponding tiers in the nave. The lowest tier contains pointed arches with an elaborate stone chancel screen; the middle tier contains cusped arches with colonettes; and the top tier serves as the clerestory. Each of the three center bays behind the chancel screen has one window group on the lower tier, each of which has two lancet windows topped by a rose window and is divided by vertical buttresses. The apse clerestory, the upper section of the ambulatory, is recessed slightly inward. The upper section&#x27;s fenestration is similar in form; each window grouping contains a rose window above a pair of lancet windows but the window groupings are on five sides of the polygon. The vertical piers of the chancel wall converge above the clerestory level, creating an apse above the chancel and ambulatory.

==== Narthex ====

The narthex, which was designed in the late Gothic style with a Romanesque layout, is directly south of the nave and can be accessed from the church&#x27;s West Portal. The narthex is split into four vaults that have Guastavino tiled ceilings that are supported by simple limestone columns. A stone spiral staircase on the west side of the narthex, directly south of the West Portal, leads to the basement. There are two grisaille windows and one rose window on each of the western and eastern sides of the narthex. The eastern wall has four 16th-century lancet windows that were previously in the Park Avenue Baptist Church; they are the only windows in Riverside Church that were not built specifically for the church. Stairs leading both upward and downward are on the eastern side of the narthex, and a mortuary chapel is on the northeastern corner. The mortuary chapel is known as the Gethsemane Chapel but prior to 1959, it was called the Christ Chapel.

==== Chapel ====
The chapel to the south of the narthex, which since 1959 has been known as the Christ Chapel, was inspired by the Basilica of Saints Nazarius and Celsus in France. Its design was inspired by the pointed Romanesque nave at Carcassonne Cathedral. The design, which was described by architectural historian Andrew Dolkart as &quot;earlier than Gothic&quot;, is intended to give the impression the rest of the sanctuary was built after the chapel. The chapel is subdivided into four bays and has a barrel-vaulted ceiling with Guastavino tiles, and the walls and floor have a limestone finish. The southern wall, which is adjacent to the MLK Wing, has four arched, back-lit stained-glass windows; one in each bay. Double doors to the west lead to Riverside Drive and a passage to the south leads to the MLK Wing. There are engaged columns on the north and south walls between each of the four bays, and eight lanterns hang from the columns.

The eastern end of the chapel contains an altar, four steps above the chapel&#x27;s main level. There is a lectern to the right of the altar and a pulpit to the left. Several sculpted representations are above the altar. Behind the altar are a baptismal pool and a reredos, which are accessed through an arched opening. An alcove to the narthex is north of the altar.
=== Tower and carillon ===

The tower was named after Laura Spelman Rockefeller, the mother of John D. Rockefeller Jr. The tower contains 21 usable floors, which include 80 classrooms and office rooms. There are four elevators, of which two rise only to the 10th floor, whereas the other two rise to the 20th floor. The 20-floor elevators, which rise , were described in 1999 as the world&#x27;s tallest elevators inside a church. Two staircases ascend from ground level; one on the western side of the tower ends at the ninth floor, and the one on the eastern side continues to the carillon. Balconies are at the southern corners on the 8th floor and on all sides of the 10th floor except the north side.

The tower&#x27;s main entrance is on the western elevation of the tower&#x27;s base and is flanked by projecting vertical piers (see ). Seven arched niches, each containing one statue of a king, are above the main entrance. A large rose window is above the statuary grouping. The apex of the tower is fitted with aircraft warning lights. Above the tenth floor are five tiers of window arrangements on each floor; the higher tiers become progressively narrower. From bottom to top, the successive tiers have two, three, four, and five windows on each side. There are narrow, canopied niches in each corner of the tower, with one statue inside each niche. At the top of the tower is a conical metal roof.

==== Tower stories ====
Most of the tower&#x27;s stories have plaster floors, steel doors, steel window frames, and iron lighting fixtures hanging from each ceiling. There are elevator lobbies with vaulted ceilings on several stories of the tower. On the stories that contain common spaces, including the ninth and tenth floors, the floors are finished with stone, terrazzo, and wood, and are fitted with wooden doors. Several spaces in the tower have been used by outside entities, who carpeted floors and installed lighting fixtures in some office rooms.

Originally, the fourth through fourteenth floors were occupied by Riverside Church&#x27;s school while the fifteenth floor and above contained staff and clergy offices, as well as spaces for group activities. The second floor connects to the nave&#x27;s lower seating gallery, while the third floor leads to the upper seating gallery. The fourth through eighth floors are below the height of the nave&#x27;s ceiling; these housed the nursery, junior high, and high school departments of the church&#x27;s school. The ninth and tenth floors housed the double-story school kitchen, school offices, and storage rooms over the nave. The ninth floor also houses a library, and there is wooden furniture in the kitchen and library. The main structure&#x27;s roof is above the tenth floor, and the tower rises independently above that point. The eleventh through fourteenth floors originally contained the church&#x27;s elementary school while the fifteenth and sixteenth floors respectively housed the young people&#x27;s meeting room and the social room. These floors were later converted into office space, and several floors were subdivided and leased out. The seventeenth through twentieth floors include meeting rooms and the seventeenth floor also contains offices. The twenty-first floor includes the carilloneur&#x27;s studio and the twenty-second floor is devoted to mechanical space.

==== Carillon ====
The 23rd floor of the tower contains a three-level belfry that houses a carillon whose final complement of 74 bronze bells, which at the time of its construction the largest carillon of bells in the world, includes the 20-ton, bourdon, the world&#x27;s largest tuned bell. Though other carillons with more bells have been commissioned, Riverside Church&#x27;s carillon is still the largest in the world by aggregate weight: the bells and associated mechanisms weigh a combined . The bells themselves are cited as weighing approximately or over 100 short tons. Of the carillon&#x27;s bells, 53 were made for the original Park Avenue church by English founders Gillett &amp; Johnston and another 19 were made for Riverside Church when it opened. Two bells were added in 1955 and 58 treble bells were replaced by bell founders Van Bergen. The bells were replaced again by Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 2004. The bells can reportedly be heard from up to from the tower. The bourdon sounds one octave lower than other bourdons.

A mechanical power room and control room are in the belfry, with the clavier cabin at the top, above the carillon. Due to the weight of the carillon, the heaviest steel beams used in the construction of Riverside Church were used in the tower. The north facade, which overhangs the nave, is supported by a single cross truss that weighs . Outside the carillon, the tower&#x27;s facade has ornate Neo-Gothic detailing that includes features such as gargoyles. On top of the carillon is a public observation deck; the deck was closed after the September 11, 2001, attacks due to security concerns but the church resumed tours in January 2020.

=== Cloister passageway ===
The cloister passageway leads from the southern portion of the nave to Claremont Avenue in the east. It has four pointed-arch bays, each with a Corinthian-style colonette topped by a grisaille window opening on the south wall. The north and south walls also contain stained-glass windows; the northern wall&#x27;s windows are artificially illuminated. Inside the cloister passageway are five vaults, which are illuminated by six lanterns. The entrance to the passageway is a small, two-story structure with two arched doorways facing Claremont Avenue and a set of double doors facing a short wheelchair ramp to the south. The top of the cloister entrance&#x27;s eastern facade contains three niches with figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and the southeastern corner contains a figure of Maaseiah. A gift shop is adjacent to the cloister passageway, and sculptures of the church&#x27;s architects and builder are above the doorway leading to the tower&#x27;s base.

=== Martin Luther King Jr. Wing ===

The Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) Wing is a seven-story annex south of the main structure and facing 120th Street along the southern boundary of the plot. The long arm of this L-shaped building lies north–south adjacent to Riverside Drive and the short arm lies west–east next to 120th Street. The MLK Wing connects to the original church building to the north and the Stone Gym to the east. The area between the MLK Wing and the cloister forms a small courtyard or garth, which is enclosed on the eastern side by a metal fence. Inside the wing are children&#x27;s chapels, space for the school, a rooftop recreation area, space for a radio station, community areas including a gymnasium and assembly room, and a basement with a parking lot.

The structure, which was designed by Collens, Willis and Beckonert, and built by Vermilea-Brown, is a simplified version of Allen and Collens&#x27; original church design and was perceived as being &quot;modern Gothic&quot;. The building was known as the South Wing until 1985, when it was renamed for civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

==== Facade ====
The facade is clad with Indiana limestone, the foundation is made of stone and concrete, and the structure is supported by a steel frame. The main entrance is through the chapel doors on Riverside Drive to the west; there are also entrances to the basement from 120th Street. The basement, first and second floors of the western facade contains eight architectural bays, each with one small lancet window, which are recessed between projecting buttresses and below a set of arches. The two outermost bays project slightly outward and do not contain recessed arches. The section of the MLK Wing above the second floor is set back from Riverside Drive, and the windows on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth floors are also recessed between buttressed arches. The seventh-floor windows are flush with the buttresses. The two outermost bays have two sets of windows rather than a single window on each floor, and project slightly outward.

The wing&#x27;s southern and eastern facades are designed in a similar fashion to the upper portion of the western facade; the seventh-floor windows are flush with the buttresses while the windows below are in recessed arched bays. The southern facade contains eight window bays, six of which are recessed. There are no windows into the first and second floors on the westernmost four bays of the southern facade but the eastern four bays do have windows into these floors. On the far eastern portion of the southern facade are two pointed-arched openings that lead to the church&#x27;s underground parking garage (see ). The eastern facade is separated into two sections; the section at the end of the wing&#x27;s short arm contains four recessed window bays. The section next to the north–south axis of the &quot;L&quot; contains six window bays, four of which are recessed.

==== Interior ====
The northern arm of the MLK Wing&#x27;s first floor includes the South Hall Lobby, which has a two-story-high coffered ceiling that is supported by a pointed-arch arcade and its walls are made of gray plaster. To the south of the lobby lie an elevator bank and an auditorium called the South Hall. The South Hall&#x27;s walls are made of wood paneling below limestone and it has nine stained-glass lancet windows on the western side. To the east of the auditorium are two mezzanine levels that lie below the South Hall&#x27;s ceiling, while a sealed tunnel leading to the Interchurch Center across 120th Street is also accessible from the auditorium.

The third-to-seventh floors include classrooms, except for the fifth floor, which contains offices. The hallway floors are made of terrazzo and individual rooms have resilient flooring, except for the fifth floor rooms, which contain carpeted rooms, and each level has dropped ceilings. Chapels for children are on the third floor&#x27;s southwestern corner and on the sixth floor&#x27;s southern side. The roof contains a solarium and a play area.

=== Stone Gym ===

The Stone Gymnasium is a -story English Gothic building at 120th Street and Claremont Avenue, east of the Martin Luther King Jr. Wing. The gym was built in 1912 to a design by Louis E. Jallade and was originally used by the Union Theological Seminary. Its architectural details include a facade of schist with limestone decoration and a metal hip roof. The structure measures five bays long on the eastern facade and one bay wide on the southern and northern facades. In 1957, Rockefeller donated the building to the church and five years later, it reopened as a gymnasium and community facility. The building&#x27;s interior contains a basketball court with synthetic flooring, and there are offices and lockers in its northern end.

=== Basement ===
Riverside Church&#x27;s basement includes several modern amenities such as a 250-seat movie theater and a gymnasium with a full-size basketball court. The section of the basement under the nave has a double-height ceiling; an assembly hall is on the southern side of this space while the gymnasium is on the northern side. The assembly hall has a stone floor and walls, and there are six arched stained-glass windows on the eastern wall and one rectangular stained glass window on the south wall, as well as cabinets that contain two Heinrich Hofmann paintings (see ). It also has a wooden ceiling that is supported by stone arches, with lanterns suspended from the ceiling and a stage in the northern portion. A kitchen is east of the stage, and a corridor runs adjacent to the western wall of the assembly room and gymnasium.

The basement originally included a four-lane bowling alley that was adjacent to the assembly floor. It was later removed and converted into storage space. There is a two-story, 150-space parking lot underneath the MLK Wing.

== Organs ==
The two Riverside Church organs are located in the chancel and the seating gallery. The chancel organ was the 14th largest in the world . It was furnished in 1930 by Hook and Hastings, and was originally criticized as mediocre. Aeolian-Skinner built an organ console in the chancel in 1948 and replaced the chancel organ in 1953–1954, and the ceiling above the chancel and the front of the nave was coated with sealant to improve the chancel&#x27;s acoustic qualities. The chancel organ was opened with a concert in March 1955 with a concert by Virgil Fox and the New York Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, attended by 3000 people.

In 1964, another Aeolian-Skinner organ was installed within the eastern wall of the nave&#x27;s seating gallery; three years later, Anthony A. Bufano installed a five-manual console for the gallery organ. The gala concert celebrating the opening of this console included a work for two organs &quot;Signs in the Sun&quot; commissioned for the event from Daniel Pinkham. M. P. Moller built another stop for the gallery organ, the Trompeta Majestatis, in 1978. Two years later, the chancel organ received a new principal chorus with the addition of the Grand Chorus division. In the 1990s, the console was rewired, the chancel organ was cleaned, and the ceiling was covered with ten layers of sealant.

The Interim Director of Music and organist is Alan Montgomery . Past organists at the Riverside Church include Virgil Fox (1946–1965), Frederick Swann (1957–1982), John Walker (1979–1992), Timothy Smith (1992–2008), and Christopher Johnson (2009–2021).

== Art and sculpture ==
=== Paintings ===

Paintings by Heinrich Hofmann that were purchased by Rockefeller Jr. and donated to the church in November 1930 are displayed in the building. &quot;Christ in the Temple&quot; (1871) and &quot;Christ and the Young Rich Man&quot; (1889) are displayed in the assembly hall beneath the nave, and are usually locked within the cabinets there. Hofmann&#x27;s &quot;Christ in Gethsemane&quot; (1890) is displayed the Gethsemane chapel.

=== Stained glass ===
Riverside Church&#x27;s main building contains 51 stained glass windows, excluding small grisaille windows. These were created in a mosaic style, which was becoming more popular at the time of the church&#x27;s construction. Of these, 34 windows are in the nave; most of them include religious iconography. Generally, the richly colored windows are on the building&#x27;s western side, which is considered the &quot;light&quot; side, while those with muted colors are on the eastern &quot;dark&quot; side.

French glassmakers Jacques Simon from Reims Cathedral and Charles Lorin from Chartres Cathedral were hired to create the glass for the clerestory windows in the nave. Lorin designed the stained-glass windows on the western side of the clerestory while Simon designed those on the eastern side. Both sets of windows depict general religious and governmental themes, and also incorporate secular iconography and depictions of non-Christians. The clerestory windows closely resemble those at Chartres and include a rose with lancet windows. The other windows in the nave were created by Boston-based firm Reynolds, Francis and Rohnstock and depict 138 scenes with both religious and non-religious contexts. The three groups of stained glass windows in the apse and the nine stained glass windows in the South Hall were created by Harry Wright Goodhue.

=== Mosaics ===
Gregor T. Goethals created two mosaics for the fourth and seventh floors of the MLK Wing. The fourth-floor mosaic depicts events described in the Old Testament while the seventh-floor mosaic depicts the Creation story.

=== Sculpted elements ===
==== Exterior elements ====

The building&#x27;s most prominent sculptural details are on the Riverside Drive facade. The main entrance beneath the tower is topped with five concentric archivolts with sculptures of Jesus&#x27;s followers and prophets inlaid within each section. The third arch of the main entrance has depictions of philosophers including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Immanuel Kant, and Pythagoras, while the second arch depicts scientists including Albert Einstein, Charles Darwin, and Hippocrates. Other figures depict the months of the year. The columns framing the door jambs beneath the archivolts are decorated with capitals and gargoyles at the top and bottom, and a single figure in the middle. In the tympanum above the doors and below the archivolts is a figure of Christ seated, which is flanked by the symbols of the Evangelists.

When Riverside Church was completed, there was controversy over the inclusion of Einstein, a living Jewish man, because the other figures represented people who had since died. According to the publication &quot;Church Monthly&quot;, during construction, the committee tasked with the church&#x27;s iconography had proposed depicting 20 scientists, not including Einstein, on the facade. The faculty, however, unanimously decided Einstein should be included because he was indisputably one of 14 &quot;leading scientists of all time&quot;.

The chapel entrance on Riverside Drive south of the main entrance contains two archivolts that are supported by two sets of columns. The archivolts depict symbols of the zodiac and the second archivolt contains an elaborate decorative molding. A tympanum relief below the archivolts depicts the Virgin Mary flanked by two angels who are mirror images of each other.

Sculpted elements are also placed within niches that are spread across the church&#x27;s facade. Above the main entrance on the western facade are sculptures of seven kings. Statues are also included in the tower&#x27;s niches, as well as in niches on the facade of the cloister entrance to the east. The facade also has gargoyles, which are outside the carillon near the top of the tower. The northern section of the nave&#x27;s roof contains &quot;Angel of the Resurrection&quot;, a bronze statue of a trumpeter atop a pedestal.

==== Interior elements ====
The carvings inside the church correspond to the respective uses of the areas in which they are sited. For instance, the 20 quatrefoil medallions inscribed on the chancel railing depict the typical &quot;interests, emphases, activities, rites, and ceremonies&quot; that are conducted within the chancel. Around the pulpit are sculptures of ten Old Testament prophets. Above the nave, the southern wall of the upper seating gallery contains multi-tiered niches, whose upper tiers contain sculpted figures of ministers. The two central niches contain a cast of Epstein&#x27;s gilded-plaster sculpture &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot;.

There seven-paneled chancel screen at the back of the chancel is carved from Caen stone. It depicts influential figures including the composer Johann Sebastian Bach, the U.S. president Abraham Lincoln, the artist Michelangelo, the social reformer Florence Nightingale, and the author Booker T. Washington. The panels depict physicians, teachers, prophets, humanitarians, missionaries, reformers, and lovers of beauty.

Above the doorway between the cloister and the tower base are statues of architects Henry Pelton and Charles Collens, as well as general contractor Robert Eidlitz.

=== Sculpture ===
When the Martin Luther King Jr. Wing was built, Jacob Epstein&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, which was commissioned in 1927, was placed in the courtyard between the MLK Wing and the cloistered entrance.

== Social services ==

Riverside Church was conceived as a complex social-services center from the outset; the building has meeting rooms, classrooms, a daycare center, a kindergarten, library, auditorium, and a gymnasium. It was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2008 as &quot;a stronghold of activism and political debate throughout its 75-year history ... influential on the nation&#x27;s religious and political landscapes&quot;. Riverside Church provides various social services, including a food bank, barber training, clothing distribution, a shower project, and confidential HIV tests and HIV counseling. In 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Riverside Church has frequently &quot;been likened to the Vatican for America&#x27;s mainstream Protestants&quot;.

=== Social justice ministries ===
==== Charity and shelter ====
Riverside Church&#x27;s prisoner-related ministries, Riverside&#x27;s Prison Ministry and Family Advocacy Program, conduct worship services in the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, help prisoners and their families, links prisoners to their communities, workshops, support groups, and events, and lobby for prison reform and humane legislation.

Riverside&#x27;s Coming Home ministry, which was founded in 1985, helps ex-prisoners after they have been released. The prison ministries began in 1971, when the Council on Christian Social Relations created a prison reform and rehabilitation task force. It also deals with homelessness in New York City. Riverside&#x27;s advocacy of the homeless originated from a similar ministry, the Clothing Room and Food Pantry, which was a subdivision of the Social Services Department. The church began sheltering homeless people overnight from 1984 until 1994, when it was closed due to the decreasing homeless population and a staff shortage.

Riverside participated in the Sanctuary movement during the 1980s, and was among numerous congregations nationwide that sheltered and assisted undocumented immigrants. As part of the New Sanctuary Coalition, volunteers at Riverside Church assist detained asylum seekers and those on parole from immigration detention. In 2011, as part of the Occupy Faith movement, Riverside Church donated tents to Occupy Wall Street protesters and sheltered them during cold and inclement weather, and after the evacuation of Zuccotti Park.

==== Social and cultural ====

Riverside Church&#x27;s LGBT ministry is named Maranatha. It was founded in 1978 in response to growing demand from gay and lesbian congregants. Maranatha hosts several activities, workshops, and events, and marches annually in the NYC Pride March. In the 1980s, when the HIV/AIDS epidemic in New York City was at its peak, there was a backlash against Maranatha because the LGBT community was negatively associated with the epidemic. These events led to the founding of the separate HIV/AIDS ministry, which hosts a support forum, provides testing, counseling, and referral programs, and collaborates with several other programs.

Riverside Church&#x27;s African Fellowship and Ministry sponsors educational forums about issues facing Africa, advocates on behalf of African diasporas with an active Facebook page. The Sharing and Densford Funds advocate on behalf of Native Americans in the United States. Other ministries at Riverside include support groups for South Africans, and for Hispanic and Latino Americans.

==== Other activism ====
Riverside Church has several other social justice ministries. The environmentalist Beloved Earth ministry has a focus on climate change activism. The Wellbotics ministry helps the families of cancer patients. The church also has several pacifist task forces, including the Anti-Death Penalty Task Force and the &quot;Overcoming Violence&quot; task force, which is dedicated to fostering dialogue with the New York City Police Department. Riverside Church also participates in the National Religious Campaign Against Torture.

=== Former programming ===
When it was completed in 1959, Riverside Church&#x27;s MLK Wing included space for a radio station that was planned by the church. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the church an FM broadcasting license in 1960, and the following year, the church started operating the radio station WRVR (later WKHK, now WLTW), which broadcast on 106.7 MHz. WRVR originally broadcast from the church&#x27;s carillon but was relocated to the Empire State Building in 1971 to increase the range of its broadcast signal. WRVR, which was originally a noncommercial station, broadcast sermons and programming from cultural and higher-education institutions in New York City. WRVR incurred an annual net loss for Riverside Church and in 1971, it was turned into a &quot;limited commercial operation&quot;, which also failed to pay for itself. The church decided to sell its radio station in 1975, and the sale was finalized the following year.

Starting in November 1976, Riverside Church hosted the Riverside Dance Festival, which was a continuation of previous dance ministries hosted by the church and normally offered 34 weeks of programming from over 60 dance companies. The program ended in June 1987 because of a $900,000 funding shortfall.

A link to 106.7 FM&#x27;s days as Riverside Church-owned WRVR remains on WLTW in the present day. A recorded sermon from Riverside Church airs on the station from 5:00 to 6:00 a.m. on Sunday mornings, as part of WLTW&#x27;s non-music public affairs programming.

<text>John David Barber (22 July 1929 – 4 February 2015) was a racing driver from England. Before his racing career he was a fish merchant in London.

He first raced a Cooper-JAP and then bought a Formula Two Cooper-Bristol Mk1 which he raced during 1952. Despite winning a minor race at Snetterton, he had little success and finally crashed the car badly towards the end of the season.

At the start of 1953, Barber travelled to Argentina to compete in the Formula One Grand Prix there with a works Cooper T23, in which he came in eighth, seven laps down. He also competed in a Formula Libre race in Buenos Aires and finished 12th.

Back in England, he raced a Golding-Cooper, which may have been built from the remains of his crashed Mk1 Cooper. While racing this car in the British Empire Trophy on the Isle of Man, he was involved in an accident which killed another driver, James Neilson. Barber sold the car soon after. He next raced in 1955, driving a Jaguar C-type.

After his motor racing career came to an end, Barber retired to live on a boat in the Mediterranean.

<text>Michael John Churchill Campbell-Jones (21 January 1930 – 24 March 2020) was a Formula One driver from England. He participated in two World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 17 June 1962. He scored no championship points. He also participated in numerous non-Championship Formula One races.

After some success in sports car racing in 1958, Campbell-Jones entered Formula Two whilst entering minor Formula One races. In 1962, he joined the Emeryson team but achieved little; his one World Championship entry was in the Belgian Grand Prix, where the Emeryson&#x27;s gearbox failed in practice. He raced a borrowed Lotus which he retired with gearbox failure, although he was classified 11th. However, he did achieve some minor placings in lesser Formula One races that year. In the 1962 Solitude Grand Prix (non-championship) he had an accident in practice and was badly burnt.

In 1963, he moved to Tim Parnell&#x27;s team which were running Lolas, but he struggled again with his single Championship entry seeing him finish 13th at the British Grand Prix. After that season, Campbell-Jones faded from the scene.

<text>John Cannon (21 June 1933 – 18 October 1999) was a sports car racer, who competed under the banner of Canada, though he was born in London, U.K. He raced in the USRRC series, the CanAm Series and the L&amp;M Continental Series (Formula 5000).

In the USRRC he drove for Nickey Chevrolet in a Dan Blocker (of &quot;Bonanza&quot; fame) sponsored Genie/Vinegaroon.

In the first year of the Can Am he was the top finishing Canadian propelled by a fourth-place finish in the opening event at his home course, Circuit Mont-Tremblant. Cannon duplicated that accomplishment in 1968 propelled by a famous win over the dominant McLaren team in a very wet race at Laguna Seca. He also attained top Canadian status in 1973.

Cannon ran in the Continental Series (Formula 5000) in 1969 winning races at Riverside, Sears Point and Mosport in the Malcolm Starr Eagle prepared by Tom Jobe and Bob Skinner and finishing fourth in the standings. In 1970 he won the championship after winning races at Riverside, Kent and Elkhart Lake driving for Malcolm Starr and St Louis trucking magnate Carl Hogan, in the Hogan-Starr Racing McLaren M-10B. He also drove for Hogan Racing in the 1971 Tasman Series where he tied for 9th in the standings.

Cannon participated in one World Championship Formula One Grand Prix, on 3 October 1971 in the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen. He finished 14th, thus he scored no championship points. He also participated in one non-Championship Formula One race, the Questor Grand Prix, finishing in 12th. During 1971 he also ran strongly in a number of rounds of the European F2 championship, impressing many.

Cannon also made 15 starts in the USAC Championship Car series while driving on a part-time basis from 1968 to 1974. His best finish was 2nd place in the second race at Circuit Mont-Tremblant in 1968. He also finished a career best 27th in series points that year. He also attempted to qualify for the Indianapolis 500 in 1970 and 1974 but failed to make the race both years.

In 1975-76 he returned to US F5000 series with a March 741 modified for F5000, and ran in midfield, with best results 4th at Riverside in 1975 and 6th on the same track in 1976 in the last US F5000 races. Although Cannon held the Ferrari dealership (actually, he worked for Hollywood Sports Cars-he did not own it) for LA, finance and engine costs limited his form in highly competitive final years of US F5000, however he proved competitive when he ran a few rounds in the UK Shellsport F5000/F1/Libre series in 1976. He ran the Australian F5000 Rothmans series at the start of 1976, winning the Sandown Park round. His last serious racing was two years later in the Australian Rothmans, aged 45 where he managed a single, third place, purely on reliability.

He was inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame in 1993. His son Michael has built a career as a race engineer. During the 2006 season at Forsythe Racing in the Champ Car World Series Michael was race engineer for A. J. Allmendinger.

Ever active, Cannon died in New Mexico, USA, from injuries received in the crash of an experimental aircraft.

<text>John Cordts (born 23 July 1935) is a former racing driver who has raced in Formula One and North American sports car racing.

Cordts participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix, the 1969 Canadian Grand Prix on 20 September 1969. He qualified 19th, but retired his Brabham after 10 laps with an oil leak, while in 16th place.

In addition to his Formula One appearance, Cordts had been successful in Canadian and U.S. sports car racing, particularly with various McLarens run by Dave Billes&#x27;s Performance Engineering. He competed in many events, ranging from Harewood Acres (where he still holds the track record when it closed in 1970), Mosport, Mont-Tremblant, and Westwood in Canada to various tracks in the US and even Japan. He later became a regular participant in the CanAm series, in which he raced until 1974, mainly in McLarens and Lolas. His best Can-Am finish was second at Road America in 1974. He was also known for his participation in the SCCA Trans-Am Series, where he had, at one point, piloted a BF Goodrich-sponsored Pontiac Firebird, known as the &quot;Tirebird&quot; and also several FIA events with the Greenwood Corvette team.

Cordts has since retired to a private life in Western Canada where he is well known for his wood carvings and recently wrote his autobiography entitled &quot;Blood, Sweat and Turnips&quot;. John was also inducted into the Canadian Motorsport Hall of Fame in 2003.

==Personal life==
Born in Hamburg, Germany, Cordts emigrated from Germany to Sweden at the age of two with his family. He emigrated to Canada when he was in his early twenties to North Bay, Ontario with his wife Inga-Britt and his one-year-old son Jimmy. His two other children, Mary and Johnny were born in Canada and moved to Sweden with their mother.

<text>John Barry Nicholson (6 October 1941 – 19 September 2017) was a racing driver from Auckland, New Zealand. He participated in two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 20 July 1974. He scored no championship points.

Nicholson was the 1973 and 1974 British Formula Atlantic champion, using a Lyncar chassis and in his &#x27;day job&#x27; was an engine-builder for McLaren. Nicholson also worked for Cosworth, Lotus and Embassy Hill, and he prepared a Saab engine for use in a Reynard Formula Three car.

Following his Formula Atlantic success, Nicholson commissioned Martin Slater of Lyncar to build him a Formula One car, despite, by this time, having established his own engine building business, which meant he was unable to commit to a full grand prix season. His race entries, therefore, were mainly in non-championship races. He entered the British Grand Prix in 1974 and 1975 and qualified for the latter race. He was classified 17th, five laps behind, despite crashing in the heavy storm towards the end of the race. Nicholson subsequently planned a further and stronger attempt at Formula One with a privateer McLaren M23 but the purchase of the chassis fell through. He did continue in both Formula Two and Formula 5000 in 1976 before racing in his native New Zealand in January 1977.

After retiring from racing, Nicholson turned his sporting attention to powerboat racing as well as continuing with his business interests.

He died in 2017 at the age of 75.

<text>John Henry Augustin Prichard, later Riseley-Prichard, (17 January 1924 in Hereford – 8 July 1993 in Thailand) was a British insurance broker and racing driver.

After getting a taste for motorsport in a road-going Riley, he bought a second-hand Connaught Type A from the Rob Walker Racing Team. Using this vehicle he participated in one Formula One World Championship Grand Prix: the British Grand Prix on 17 July 1954. He spun out of the race, scoring no championship points. In addition to this he competed in a number of non-Championship Formula One and Formula Libre races, including a victory in the 1954 I Cornwall MRC Formula 1 Race.

Riseley-Prichard shared an Aston Martin in the infamous 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race with Tony Brooks, but after the trauma of this event retired from race driving. Later in the same year, he let Brooks take the wheel of his Connaught, giving the future Vanwall and Ferrari star his first big break.

Later in life, Riseley-Prichard became the centre of a child pornography scandal, and he emigrated to Thailand. After a lengthy illness he died in Baan Kai Thuan, a remote village approximately inland of Bangkok.

<text>Octave John Claes (; 11 August 1916 – 3 February 1956) was a British-born racing driver who competed for Belgium. Before his fame as a racing driver, Claes was also a jazz trumpeter and successful bandleader in Britain.

==Early life and jazz career==

Claes was born in London to a Scottish mother and Belgian father. He was educated in England at Lord Williams&#x27;s School. In England, he began playing trumpet in a jazz band that included Max Jones on reeds, and another with Billy Mason on piano. In the 1930s he moved to the Netherlands, where he worked with Valaida Snow and Coleman Hawkins. He also worked with Jack Kluger&#x27;s band in Belgium. Returning to England, he led his own group, the Claepigeons, making a recording in 1942. In the late 1940s he abandoned his jazz career and settled in Belgium as a professional racing driver.

Claes was one of several gentlemen drivers who took part in Grand Prix racing of post-World War II. His first contact with racing was at the 1947 French Grand Prix, where he served as interpreter for British drivers. He made his debut in 1948, in his own Talbot-Lago, raced under the &quot;Écurie Belge&quot; banner. Although Claes never scored any points in the World Drivers Championship, he was, like many of his contemporaries, very active in non-Championship Grand Prix races and sports car races. His first win was at the 1950 Grand Prix des Frontières, held at the Chimay race track.

In April 1951 Claes crashed into a crowd while practicing at San Remo Grand Prix in Sanremo, Italy. He was uninjured but an observer was killed and three onlookers were seriously injured. In 1952 he exchanged his outdated Talbot for a Gordini, and later for a Connaught, always with the Écurie Belge colours, but he also raced occasionally for works teams, including Gordini and Maserati. He also won the 1953 Liège–Rome–Liège Rally and took a class win at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans. Claes teamed with Pierre Stasse to finish 12th in the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans. They drove a Porsche. Together with compatriot Jacques Swaters, Claes finished third in the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Later in 1955 Claes&#x27; health problems worsened, as he had contracted tuberculosis. Claes sold his outfit to Swaters, who merged it with his own Écurie Francorchamps to form Écurie Nationale Belge. Claes entered occasional events until the end of the year, but finally succumbed to the disease in Brussels in 1956, aged 39.

<text>Louis José Lucien Dolhem (26 April 1944 – 16 April 1988) was a racing driver from France, and the half brother (and also 1st cousin) of Formula One driver Didier Pironi (they had the same father and their mothers were sisters).

Dolhem was born in Paris. He participated in three Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 7 July 1974, and scoring no championship points. His single grand prix start came to end when he was withdrawn by his team after his team-mate Helmut Koinigg&#x27;s fatal accident during the season-ending US Grand Prix.

Dolhem died in a plane crash at Saint-Just-Saint-Rambert near Saint-Etienne in 1988. Dolhem and Pironi, who died while offshore powerboat racing eight months earlier, are buried in the same plot at Grimaud, near St Tropez in southern France.

<text>is a Japanese former racing driver and businessman.

==Motorsport career==
Hoshino&#x27;s nickname was . He won the Japanese motocross national championships in the 90cc and 125cc classes for Kawasaki in 1968 before switching to cars as a Nissan factory driver in 1969.

Hoshino participated in two Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 24 October 1976 at the Japanese Grand Prix, making him – along with compatriots Noritake Takahara and Masahiro Hasemi – the first Japanese driver to start a Formula One Grand Prix. Driving a Tyrrell-Ford for Heros Racing, he ran as high as fourth, but retired having used up his tyre supply. He returned in 1977 and once again entered the Japanese Grand Prix driving for Heros Racing. He finished in eleventh place driving a year-old Kojima-Ford. He scored no championship points in his Formula 1 career.

His only major world championship win was in the 1985 World Sportscar Championship round at the Fuji 1000 race, which was boycotted by many competing teams due to torrential rain.

Hoshino won the Japanese Formula 2000 championship in 1975 and 1977, before winning the Japanese Formula Two championship in 1978. He then competed in the Japanese Formula 3000 championship, winning that title in 1987, 1990 and 1993. His 6 championships and 39 race wins still stand as series records.

Hoshino also dominated the Fuji Grand Champion Series in the 1970s and 1980s. He won five titles in 1978, 1982, 1984, 1985 and 1987, collecting 28 wins and 42 podiums.

Like his compatriot, Masahiro Hasemi, he continued his career racing for Nissan, driving a Skyline GT-R to win the Japanese Touring Car Championship in 1990. Hoshino drove a Nissan R90C with Toshio Suzuki to win the 1990 Suzuka 1000 race. Hoshino and Suzuki also won the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship in 1991 and 1992. Along with Nissan Motorsports teammates Aguri Suzuki and Masahiko Kageyama, Hoshino drove a Nissan R390 GT1 to a third-place finish at the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Hoshino retired from racing in 2002 and now continues to run his own Super GT team and his own Nissan specialised aftermarket parts company, Impul. Since 2003, his racing team has won the Formula Nippon championship seven times in eight years. His son, Kazuki Hoshino, currently competes in Super GT driving for GAINER in the GT300 class.

<doc id="1234965" wikidata="Q2378914" url="?curid=1234965" title="Barnton, Cheshire">
<text>Barnton is a civil parish and village, just outside the town of Northwich, in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. It lies north and east of the Trent &amp; Mersey Canal which goes through two tunnels (Barnton and Saltersford) to the west of the village.

The village can roughly be divided into four parts: the old village which grew northeastwards from the southwest corner; the more up-market properties northwest-wards along and to the west of the main Runcorn Road (A533); the council-built estate to the north west, largely between Townfield Lane and Runcorn Road; and the more modern estates (the largest known as the Locke estate after the builders) to the north and east. The village has no easily identifiable centre with some shops along the Runcorn Road and others by the new Health Centre in Lydyett Lane.

There is currently only one pub, a small number for such a large village and greatly fewer than there were 100 years ago. The parish church is Christ Church in Church Road in the old part of the village; there are also Catholic, Methodist and Pentecostal churches.

Barnton F.C. were founder members of the Mid Cheshire Football League and now compete in the North-West counties league division one south. The new village hall (the Memorial Hall) is located next to the Barnton F.C. ground off Townfield Lane. The village also has a cricket club which is located close to Barnton School which is also on Townfield Lane.

Below the village where the main A533 crosses the River Weaver, on 19 August 1659, at the Battle of Winnington Bridge, a Parliamentary army of 5,000 men under the command of General John Lambert defeated a rebel Royalist army of 4,000 men under the command of Sir George Booth. A plaque marking this was erected on the bridge in August 2009 by the Northwich &amp; District Heritage Society, 350 years after the battle commenced.

The Parish Church, Christ Church, Barnton was completed in 1842 and the Vicarage stands proudly on Church Road overlooking the Winnington Village housing estate. Further along at Church Road junction stands the old Police Station, which was built in 1902 for the sergeant who lived on Bells Brow. It contained an office, an interview room and three cells. There is still has a row of back-to-back houses on Bell&#x27;s Brow at the top of Barnton Hill built in 1810 to accommodate Brunner Mond labourers.

Barnton became known as &quot;Jam Town&quot; in the late 1800s due to so many people owning and not renting their homes. &quot;People in Barnton eat Jam butties so that they can own not only their own houses, but buy their neighbours too!&quot;. In December 2018, a wooden carving of a young boy eating a Jam Sandwich was unveiled in honour of the sacrifices for home ownership in the village. The statue was named the &#x27;Jam Butty Boy&#x27;, and is located on the A533 (Runcorn Road) that runs through the village.

<text>Kenneth Henry Downing (5 December 1917 – 3 May 2004) was an English racing driver. From a wealthy family, he began racing in the late 1940s, competing in his first event the Eastbourne Rally in a Healey. Initially racing a Brooke Special, he switched to a Connaught in 1951, winning 17 races throughout the year.

Downing switched to single seaters in 1952, racing a Connaught A-Type, and won the Madgwick Cup at Goodwood and second place at the Grand Prix des Frontières at Chimay, where he lost the lead at the end of the race several metres before the finish line. He finished ninth in the at Silverstone, but had run fourth in the race before spinning while avoiding a backmarker. He competed in the later that year, but retired from an oil-pressure problem. He switched to an Aston Martin DB3 for 1953, but decided to retire from racing soon after.

<text>Kenneth McAlpine (21 September 1920 – 8 April 2023) was a British racing driver from England.

==Biography==
McAlpine was born in Cobham, Surrey and was a grandson of Scottish civil engineer Sir Robert McAlpine, 1st Baronet. He participated in seven Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 19 July 1952 at the British Grand Prix alongside fellow Connaught driver Kenneth Downing. During the development of the Connaught Racing Team based at Send in Surrey, McAlpine became a considerable financial backer and enjoyed several team owner triumphs including Tony Brooks&#x27;s memorable F1 victory at the 1955 Syracuse Grand Prix. The team was eventually broken up in 1957 and cars sold off after McAlpine ceased receiving tax concessions.

McAlpine and co-driver Eric Thompson took part in the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans driving a Connaught ALSR. They retired after 6 hours with engine failure.

After retiring from motor racing, McAlpine returned full-time to his civil engineering business and later established a successful English wine growing and bottling business at his estate in Lamberhurst, Kent. He was also a member of The Air Squadron.

McAlpine died on 8 April 2023, at the age of 102.

<doc id="1234981" wikidata="Q477067" url="?curid=1234981" title="Mauritania national football team">
<text>The Mauritania national football team (), nicknamed Al-Murabitun in the reference to Almoravid dynasty, represents Mauritania in men&#x27;s international football. It is controlled by the Féderation de Football de la République Islamique de Mauritanie, and is a member of the Confederation of African Football. They have not qualified for the FIFA World Cup. However, in the Amílcar Cabral Cup, a regional tournament for West Africa, Mauritania came fourth in 1980 on hosting the competition. The national football team of Mauritania later runners-up in 1995, losing on penalties to Sierra Leone after the final finished 0–0.

On 18 November 2018, Mauritania qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in history, after they won 2–1 against Botswana to seal a spot in the 2019 tournament.

==History==

===1963–80===
Mauritania played its first match after independence from France on 11 April 1963, against Congo Kinshasa (also making their debut) and lost 6–0. The match was held in Dakar, Senegal as part of the L&#x27;Amitié tournament between African sides. It also saw the debuts of Chad, Liberia and Niger. Mauritania lost its three other matches in the tournament: 2–0 to the Ivory Coast, 4–0 to Tunisia and 7–0 to Congo Brazzaville.

Mauritania&#x27;s first goal and avoidance of defeat came four years after their debut, in 1967 with a 1–1 draw away in Tanzania. This was their first match since the L&#x27;Amitié tournament in 1963.

Mauritania entered their first African Games qualification campaign, in an aim to reach the 1973 finals in Nigeria. They were drawn in a group against Mali and Guinea in Guinea. The first game was lost 11–0 to Mali, and on 20 May Mauritania lost 14–0 to Guinea. Mauritania did not qualify.

In May 1976 Mauritania entered qualification for the football at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Canada. They were drawn against neighbouring Mali in a two-legged qualifier. The first leg was lost 6–0 away on 1 May, and the second leg was lost 1–0 at home on 18 May. Mali did not qualify for the finals.

Mauritania&#x27;s first entrance into World Cup qualification was an attempt to reach the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina. In March 1976 they were one of four countries put into two preliminary matches at the start of the African qualification campaign. Mauritania&#x27;s preliminary was a two-legged match against the Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso) and they drew the first match 1–1 away in Ouagadougou on 13 March. This was their first competitive avoidance of defeat, and their first avoidance of defeat since 1967. On 28 March, Mauritania lost their home leg in Nouakchott 2–0 and the Upper Volta advanced 3–1 on aggregate.

On 12 October 1980, seventeen years after their first game, Mauritania won for the first time by beating Mali 2–1 at home in a qualifier for the African Cup of Nations. Mali won 3–2 on aggregate having won the first leg 2–0.

===1998 FIFA World Cup qualification===
Mauritania entered qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, which was their first entry in twenty years and second overall. Again, they were drawn to face Burkina Faso in a two-legged preliminary. The first leg was played at home in Nouakchott in front of 15,000 people on 31 May 1996, one day before any other matches in the round. The match finished 0–0. The second leg was played at the Stade du 4-Aout in Ouagadougou on 16 June 1996 in front of 13,000 people. Burkina Faso won 2–0 to advance to the final group phase.

===2002 FIFA World Cup qualification===
Mauritania entered the qualification for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and were placed in a preliminary against Tunisia, who had qualified for the previous tournament. On 7 April 2000 they hosted Tunisia at the Stade Olympique in Nouakchott. A crowd of 10,000 saw Tunisia win 2–1 with second-half goals from Radhi Jaidi and Hassen Gabsi. In the second leg on 22 April 2000, Mauritania were beaten 3–0 at the Stade El Menzah in Tunis. The match was watched by only 3,000, despite a capacity of 45,000 in the ground. Tunisia won 5–1 on aggregate and later qualified for the finals in South Korea and Japan.

===2006 FIFA World Cup qualification===
Mauritania were drawn with Zimbabwe in the preliminary of the African section of the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification. On 12 October 2003 they lost the away leg 3–0 at the National Sports Stadium in Harare in front of 55,000 people. In the home return at the Stade Olympique on 14 November 2003, Mauritania scored twice in the opening ten minutes to win 2–1, their first victory in a World Cup match. However, Zimbabwe advanced 4–2 on aggregate.

===2010 FIFA World Cup qualification===
The African qualification process was altered for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Only the six lowest-ranked nations played a preliminary, a selection which for the first time did not include Mauritania. Mauritania played in Group 8 of the second qualifying round against Rwanda, Morocco and Ethiopia, and started with an away match at the Stade Regional Nyamirambo in Kigali, Rwanda on 31 May 2008. They lost 3–0 in front of 12,000 people. The first home match was on 7 June at the Stade Nacional in Nouakchott against Morocco. The Moroccans scored two in each half before a late penalty by Dominique da Silva of Mauritania made the game 4–1.

On 13 June 2008 Mauritania hosted Ethiopia at the Stade Nacional and lost 1–0 after an injury-time winner from Saladin Said. On 22 June Mauritania lost 6–1 in the away match versus Ethiopia at the Addis Ababa Stadium. The Ethiopian forwards Fikru Tefera and Andualem Nigussie scored two goals each in a match which also saw Ba Yaoub of Mauritania sent off after 37 minutes, conceding a penalty to Fikru. The game was 1–1 at half time. In September 2008 Ethiopia were expelled from the tournament due to government interferences in their football association and all of their results annulled.

Only 1,000 people saw Mauritania&#x27;s next game at the Stade Nacional as they were beaten 1–0 by Rwanda on 6 September with a late goal by Bobo Bola. Mauritania finished their group campaign at the Stade Moulay Abdellah in Rabat, Morocco. Like the home game against the Moroccans, Mauritania were 4–0 down but scored the last goal, this time by Dahmed Ould Teguedi. Although the Moroccan stadium had a capacity of 52,000, only 1,472 saw the match.

===2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualification===

Mauritania beat Mauritius 1–0 in the first leg of a preliminary round qualifier for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in Nouakchott.
SC Bastia&#x27;s midfielder Adama Ba scored the only goal midway through the first half. The return leg in Curepipe ended 2–0 in favour of Mauritania. Scorers were Demba Sow and Moulaye Ahmed Bessam.

In the first round, first leg match, Mauritania beat visitors Equatorial Guinea 1–0 in Nouakchott. The two sides headed into the break scoreless in their match played at Office du Complexe Olympique de Nouakchott. Hosts Mauritania broke the deadlock in the 76th minute through their Tunisian-based striker Ismaël Diakité. In the return match Equatorial Guinea beat Mauritania 3–0 in Malabo. Equatorial Guinea won 3–1 on aggregate. However, on 3 July 2014, the CAF announced that Equatorial Guinea were disqualified for fielding the ineligible player Thierry Fidjeu in the tie, and as a result, Mauritania advanced to the second round. Equatorial Guinea later qualified for the final tournament as replacement hosts.

===2019 Africa Cup of Nations===
On 18 November 2018, Mauritania qualified to the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations for the first time in their history, after they won 2–1 against Botswana, coming second in qualification Group I.

<doc id="1234982" wikidata="Q172252" url="?curid=1234982" title="Kunimitsu Takahashi">
<text>was a Japanese professional motorcycle road racer, racing driver, and team manager. Nicknamed &quot;Kuni-san&quot;, he is known as the &quot;father of drifting&quot;.

His racing career lasted from 1958 to 1999. He competed on motorcycles between 1958 and 1963, during which he became the first Japanese rider to win a World Grand Prix, taking four world-level wins in total. Injuries sustained in a crash in 1962 led to him switching to four-wheels in 1965, after which he won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in class, become a four-time All-Japan Sports Prototype Champion, and won in Japanese Top Formula, JTC, and JGTC. His final victory as a driver came in 1999 at the age of 59.

His racing team, Team Kunimitsu, has won multiple championships in Super GT. He was the chairman of the GT Association, the organizers of the Super GT series, from 1993 to 2007.

==Motorcycle racing==
In 1961, Takahashi became the first Japanese rider to win a motorcycle Grand Prix riding a 250cc Honda to victory at Hockenheim. His best World Championship finishes were a fourth place in the 1961 250 world championship and a fourth place in the 1962 125 world championship, both times on a Honda. He was seriously injured in the 1962 Isle of Man TT and switched to car racing in 1965. He won four Grand Prix races during his motorcycle racing career.

==Car racing==
Takahashi participated in one Formula One race, the 1977 Japanese Grand Prix on 23 October 1977, driving the non-works Tyrrell that Kazuyoshi Hoshino had used in the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix. Takahashi finished 9th in his single Grand Prix outing, thus he scored no championship points. From 1987 to 1992, he competed in the Japanese Formula 3000 championship. He also competed in eight 24 Hours of Le Mans races between 1986 and 1996. In the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans, his team competed with a Honda NSX, winning the GT2 Class and finishing eighth overall.

In 1994, he formed Team Kunimitsu to compete in the inaugural JGTC season, running a Porsche 911 RSR Turbo in the GT1 class alongside Keiichi Tsuchiya. In 1996, with the advent of the GT500 class, Team Kunimitsu switched manufacturers from Porsche to Honda. The next year, Team Kunimitsu cars wore the Raybrig colors for the first time. Takahashi drove for his own team until 1999. He retired at the end of the season to focus on team management. Team Kunimitsu won their first Drivers Championship in 2018 with Naoki Yamamoto and 2009 Formula One champion Jenson Button behind the wheel of the #100 Raybrig Honda.

==Death==
Takahashi died from lymphoma on 16 March 2022, at the age of 82.

<text>Lamberto Leoni (born 24 May 1953) is a former racing driver from Italy. He participated in five Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, failing to qualify for three of them. He scored no championship points.

==Career==
After racing in Italian Formula 3, Leoni graduated to European Formula 2 in 1976. He had a promising start, finishing third in his first race with Massimo Ciccozzi&#x27;s team Scuderia del Passatore at Autódromo do Estoril. He then raced for Giancarlo Minardi&#x27;s Scuderia Everest, with mixed results. His best result came the following season, when he won at Misano with a car fielded by Scuderia Trivellato.

In 1977 Leoni made his Formula One debut with Surtees at the 1977 Italian Grand Prix, replacing Vern Schuppan, but failed to qualify. The following year he joined Morris Nunn&#x27;s Ensign. Leoni qualified for the opening event, the 1978 Argentine Grand Prix, but was forced to retire the car after 28 laps because of an engine failure. At the following race in Brazil, Leoni once again managed to qualify but was prevented from starting the race after his transmission broke down during the formation lap. After failing to qualify the car in the following two races in South Africa and the United States, Leoni departed from the team and was replaced by Jacky Ickx.

Leoni returned to Formula 2 and then Formula 3000. In 1987 he formed his own First Racing team. Following a few moderately successful seasons, with wins for drivers Marco Apicella and Pierluigi Martini, in 1989 Leoni made an abortive attempt to enter Formula One with a car designed by Richard Divila and Gabriele Tarquini at the wheel. The car, however, was poorly assembled and although Leoni commissioned a second chassis, he eventually elected to end the team experience in Formula One. The second chassis was then purchased by Ernesto Vita for his unsuccessful Life outfit.

Leoni subsequently managed the career of Apicella, who ended up winning the Super Formula Championship in 1994 and have an outing in Formula One with Jordan Grand Prix in 1993.

In the early 1990s, Leoni resumed his racing career by becoming involved in powerboat racing. He was able to win several races and narrowly missed the 1993 World Championship.

<doc id="1234984" wikidata="Q172199" url="?curid=1234984" title="Lance Macklin">
<text>Lance Noel Macklin (2 September 1919 – 29 August 2002) was a British racing driver from England. He participated in 15 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 18 May 1952. He was infamously involved in the 1955 Le Mans disaster, starting the initial chain reaction.

==Early life==
Macklin&#x27;s father was the automotive entrepreneur Noel Macklin, founder of both the Invicta and Railton car companies, as well as Fairmile Marine, a manufacturer of motor gun and torpedo boats during World War II. Macklin was born in Kensington, and educated at Eton College. He volunteered for service with the Royal Navy in 1939 and (in line with his father&#x27;s business) was assigned to work on motor gun boats.

==Motoring career==
On demobilisation after the Second World War, Macklin followed his early ambition and became a racing driver, although an early attempt to enter a race on the Isle of Man was refused on grounds that he had no experience.

He secured an entry to the 1948 Grand Prix des Frontières, and practised for the event by driving his Invicta at high speeds on public roads, teaching himself to four-wheel drift around Belgrave Square in London&#x27;s Mayfair. He impressed in the race and eventually earned a signing with Aston Martin. He was made a reserve driver for Le Mans and raced at the Spa 24 Hours, finishing fifth.

He finished fifth at Le Mans in 1950 alongside teammate and HWM owner George Abecassis. Abecassis invited him to join HWM for several races, culminating with victory in the 1952 BRDC International Trophy, his biggest success in motor racing. HWM also gave Macklin his debut in the Formula One World Championship, but the small team was not competitive against the better-funded works entries and he scored no world championship points. While at HWM, Macklin formed a close bond with young teammate Stirling Moss.

He returned to Le Mans with Aston Martin in 1951, finishing third overall and taking his second S3.0 class victory, although class victories were not celebrated at that time. He left Aston Martin in 1952, dissatisfied with his retaining fee, and joined Bristol for the following year. The new team found little success, failing even to start the 1952 12 Hours of Reims, but such issues typically did not faze him. Macklin&#x27;s social confidence and smooth demeanour made him popular with women, and he would sometimes be more interested in them than racing. Abecassis had been critical of this easy-going attitude: &quot;He never cared whether he started in a race or not... Sometimes it was a nightmare to make him practice at all. If there was some blonde he was after he just wouldn&#x27;t show up.&quot;

=== Role in the 1955 Le Mans disaster ===
In the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans he was involved in the most catastrophic accident in racing history, which killed Pierre Levegh and 83 spectators and became known as the &quot;1955 Le Mans disaster&quot;. Macklin swerved to avoid hitting the Jaguar of Mike Hawthorn, who was braking hard in a late attempt to pit, and moved into the path of Levegh&#x27;s car causing it to clip his. Although Macklin&#x27;s car crashed, he was uninjured. Macklin was deeply affected by the incident. He felt that Hawthorn had tried to alleviate himself of responsibility, and that the racing community was turning the blame to him as a result.

He continued to race, but another tragic experience followed in the Tourist Trophy at Dundrod. Macklin crashed his Austin-Healey 100S avoiding an accident in which Jim Mayers and William T. Smith were killed. Soon after, Macklin retired from motor sport at the urging of his then-girlfriend.

==Business career==
Macklin joined Facel Vega in Paris, running the export division until the company failed in 1963, when he began working for London car dealership H.R. Owen.

==Personal life==
Macklin was married twice; firstly to Shelagh and subsequently to Gillian. He had two children from his first marriage and one from the second.

==Later years==
He later moved to Spain, but returned to England when he became ill. He died on 29 August 2002 in Tenterden, Kent, four days before his 83rd birthday.

<doc id="1234985" wikidata="Q173325" url="?curid=1234985" title="Leo Kinnunen">
<text>Leo Juhani &quot;Leksa&quot; Kinnunen (5 August 1943 – 26 July 2017) was a Finnish racing driver, and the first Formula One driver from Finland.

Kinnunen won the Nordic Challenge Cup in 1969, the Interserie from 1971–1973, and helped Porsche to take the World Sportscar Championship for manufacturers in 1970 (drivers championships were not awarded until 1981). In 1974, he switched to Formula One, but in addition to the problems with the underpowered Surtees TS16, his team soon ran into financial problems. He was the last driver to compete in Formula One using an open-face helmet.

==Early career==
Kinnunen started his racing career on motorcycles, but switched to four wheels after receiving his driver&#x27;s license in the early 1960s. He quickly gained success in rallying, autocross and ice racing. He finished runner-up in the Finnish Rally Championship and matched the points total of the winner Simo Lampinen. Kinnunen also participated in the Finnish F3 Championship with an outdated Brabham in 1967, and a Titan which he drove to several victories in 1968, including one at Ahvenisto Race Circuit in which he managed to beat Swedish future Formula One star Ronnie Peterson.

==International breakthrough==
In 1969, Kinnunen made a complete switch to circuit racing and won the Nordic Challenge Cup, predecessor of the popular Interserie, with two wins and a second place at Keimola Motor Stadium after a close battle with Jochen Rindt. He was then invited to test a Porsche 917 at Österreichring and made such an impression that he was hired to partner Pedro Rodriguez in the World Sportscar Championship. The pair surprised the racing world by winning the first race, 24 Hours of Daytona, and went on to win the overall championship for Porsche. For Kinnunen, however, this was unsatisfying time. The car was built for Rodriguez&#x27; measurements and driving style, and after Kinnunen managed to quickly outpace him with his own set-ups, he wasn&#x27;t allowed to modify the car to suit his style anymore. His chance to shine finally came at Targa Florio with the new Porsche 908/03 as Rodriguez was ill on the race day. On the final lap of the race, Kinnunen set a time of 33&#x27;36min, breaking the old lap record by 1½ minutes. This is still the fastest ever time recorded for the Sicilian road circuit.

==Interserie==
Kinnunen then moved on to drive Porsche 917 for Finnish AAW Racing Team in the Interserie. He won the championship in his debut year, despite withdrawing from the race at Norisring after seeing his former team-mate Rodriguez crash into the barriers and lose his life. He eventually went on to win the championship three times in a row, in 1971, 1972 and 1973, with a total of 18 heat and 11 outright wins. In 1973, he also participated in the World Rally Championship event 23rd 1000 Lakes Rally and finished third with his Porsche Carrera, behind Timo Mäkinen and Markku Alén.

==Formula One==
Kinnunen was close to moving to Formula One already for the 1971 season. With the help of Jochen Rindt he was negotiating for a race seat with Team Lotus, which was dominating the series at the time and eventually won the World Constructors&#x27; Championship that season. After Rindt&#x27;s sudden death at Monza, the negotiations came to a halt. According to Kinnunen, Bernie Ecclestone wanted him to drive for free. Kinnunen turned down the offer and demanded a wage for his services, as he was a professional racer.

In 1974, Kinnunen was looking for a job and John Surtees offered him one of his new Formula One cars, Surtees TS16, on lease. Kinnunen accepted the offer since the Surtees TS14 had done well the previous season. After finally finding sponsorship, Kinnunen entered the series with a new team and a Cosworth DFV V8 3.0 litre engine. Antti Aarnio-Wihuri allowed the team to use the AAW Racing Team name, which was recognized and had a good reputation in racing circles.

AAW Racing&#x27;s first Grand Prix at Nivelles turned out to be a disaster. The TS16 arrived in time for the race weekend, but Kinnunen had never even sat in the car before. It also turned out that the car had been used as a mobile testbed by the factory, and it already had a damaged monocoque and rear suspension. On top of that, it was 80 kilos overweight, the engine lacked power and the team was not allowed to get the top quality tires used by the top teams. When Kinnunen took the car on track, its gearbox broke after three laps. The team, consisting of only three mechanics, had no spare parts and repair work turned out to be unsuccessful, as the gearbox broke again in qualifying, leaving Kinnunen without a recorded time and the only driver not to qualify for the race.

After Nivelles, the team concentrated on testing and fixing the car. They did not travel to Monaco but entered the next race in Sweden. Kinnunen qualified 25th, and while usually only 24 drivers would be allowed to start, Kinnunen&#x27;s good standing within the Swedish motorsport circle meant an exception was made for him and he was allowed to start.

The AAW team knew that the car would not last the whole race, so they fueled it for only ten laps in order to make a quick press run. This compensated for the TS16&#x27;s heavy weight, and Kinnunen managed to overtake five cars in eight laps before a spark plug problem forced him to retire. Kinnunen later stated that a spark plug thread in the cylinder head had been stripped prior to the race. A Ferrari mechanic had loaned them a threaded insert kit to fix it, but a mechanic inadvertently damaged the threads while installing the plug and it never seated properly.

The rest of the season did not go well for the team either. They were not allowed to take part in the Dutch Grand Prix, and failed to qualify for the races in France, Great Britain, Italy or Austria. Lack of funding then forced the team to retire from Formula One.

==Later career==

After his short stint in Formula One, Kinnunen went back to the Interserie for the series&#x27; last event in Hockenheim. He won both heats, and placed sixth overall in the championship just for the points from this race. Kinnunen was then hired by Martini Racing to drive a Porsche 908 Turbo in the World Sportscar Championship in 1975. Partnered with Herbert Müller, his best result of the season was third at Nürburgring. In 1976, he switched teams and raced a Porsche 934 Turbo with Egon Evertz. They managed to collect three podium places and the highlight of the season was a second place at Watkins Glen. After the season the team quit in racing due to financial problems. Kinnunen quit his circuit racing career in 1977, but still raced in a few rally events in Finland, winning the 1979 Arctic Rally. He remained in the sport in administration and lived in Turku.

Kinnunen was asked to drive in the film &quot;Le Mans&quot; personally by actor and racing enthusiast Steve McQueen, who himself drove for Porsche in North America. Kinnunen&#x27;s contract with Porsche did not allow the performance and he was replaced by David Piper, who was severely injured during the filming.

<doc id="1234987" wikidata="Q172795" url="?curid=1234987" title="Les Leston">
<text>Alfred Lazarus Fingleston (16 December 1920 – 13 May 2012), better known as Les Leston, or in full Leslie Leston, was a British racing driver, born in Bulwell, Nottinghamshire.

==Early life==

Leston was the second son of Harry Fingleston, a coal factor from Milton Chambers, Nottingham, and his wife Kate or Kitty, née Fine, his elder brother being Dennis Leston the entomologist.

In his early life Leston was a successful drummer for the jazz band The Clay Pigeons. He also served in WW2 as a mid-upper gunner in an Avro Lancaster.

In 1939 before the outbreak of war he was the shopkeeper for fancy and toilet goods as part of the family business, and soon after the war finished he and his father &quot;Monty&quot; (otherwise Henry or Harry ) set up a successful aeronautical accessories business, Aero Spares, a company involved in a variety of technical appliances made for war planes.

==Racing career==

He started racing in a Jaguar SS100 before acquiring a 500cc Cooper and his own Leston Special. He won the Luxembourg Grand Prix in 1952 (a race containing Stirling Moss and Peter Collins), and became a Cooper works driver in 1954 winning the British Formula Three championship in the same year. He participated in three Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 2 September 1956, but scored no championship points. He was entered to 1962 Le Mans by Colin Chapman to co-drive with Tony Shelly in a Lotus 23, but the race organizer, ACO, denied the entry in the famous Lotus Le Mans debacle. His best success at Le Mans came as an Aston Martin works driver with Roy Salvadori where he finished 6th overall in 1957.

From 1958 to 1960 he had a successful stint in a Riley 1.5 becoming British Saloon Car champion in Class B as well as campaigning the car in the Monte Carlo Rally and using it as a daily run about for business and pleasure.

He was most famous for driving the famous DADIO - a Lotus Elite. His duels with Graham Warner in LOV1 have gone down in British racing history. He would become British GT Champion in this car and have many victories.

==Life outside racing ==

After escaping from a serious crash at Caen in 1958 when his F2 Lotus seized and the engine caught fire, he concentrated on his ever-expanding motorcar accessories business – the field that he was best known for. Les Leston Accessories merchandised aftermarket parts for cars, such as steering wheels and gear levers. The steering wheels were made in Walsall and like with most things in the aftermarket motoring accessories field Les Leston was the first to offer such items - hence he gained the tag as the godfather of the motoring aftermarket.

It was after receiving burns in the crash in Caen (where he leapt from the car at 90 mph) that he pioneered the marketing of flameproof overalls. At the time many racing drivers wore short sleeved shirts - Leston&#x27;s fame and connection to all the great Formula One drivers meant that very soon a lot of them were wearing Les Leston overalls. Graham Hill appeared regularly in Leston&#x27;s adverts in such overalls, also sporting the Leston made Graham Hill rally master jacket.

In the late 1960s Leston became a Formula One pit reporter for the BBC, until he was replaced by Barrie Gill.

In the 1990s Leston lived in Hong Kong, where he was married twice and expanded his merchandising business sourcing-in from China the giveaways, etc., that were rewards for incentives such as submitting cereal-box tops. His lifestyle involved owning a large cruiser that he would take out to sea at weekends and a jazz radio show. He frequented the bar of the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club, and for leisure he rode a BMW 1,200 cc motor bike.

<doc id="1234991" wikidata="Q172208" url="?curid=1234991" title="Leslie Johnson (racing driver)">
<text>Leslie George Johnson (22 March 1912 – 8 June 1959) was a British racing driver who competed in rallies, hill climbs, sports car races and Grand Prix races.

==Overview==

Leslie Johnson was born in Walthamstow, at that time one of London&#x27;s poorest districts, and he spent his early years there. His father, a cabinet maker, died soon after starting his own business. Johnson, left with a mother and younger brother to support even though he was still in his teens, took charge of the firm. The employees responded to his enlightened, philanthropic management with a loyalty and dedication which, allied to Johnson&#x27;s astute business brain, helped create the successful furniture manufacturing business that funded his entry into motor sport.

When competition resumed after World War II he progressed from rallies to hill climbs, sports car racing and single-seaters. Although a prodigiously gifted driver who early in his career won the admiration of senior competitors such as Raymond Sommer and Louis Chiron, he never made a full commitment to racing. Business interests remained his primary focus. Further, as a child his heart and kidneys were damaged by nephritis and acromegaly, and deteriorating health in adulthood imposed its own constraints on his racing.

He specialised in European sports car endurance events, competing in five Le Mans 24-hour races, two Spa 24-hour races and four Mille Miglias. He also took part in five Grands Prix, and broke several world speed records for production cars.

In sports car racing, he achieved Aston Martin&#x27;s first postwar international victory, and also the first successes for Jaguar&#x27;s XK120 model in both England and America.

His business ventures included the acquisition of British racing car manufacturer English Racing Automobiles (ERA) after World War II. He also initiated and negotiated Stirling Moss&#x27;s first commercial sponsorship deal, with Shell.

Among his close friends were Jaguar founder William Lyons (to whom he lent his BMW 328 for detailed mechanical investigation during the planning and design of the XK120) and Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix engineering supremo Rudolf Uhlenhaut. (Johnson used three Mercedes-Benz road cars: 300SL &quot;gullwing,&quot; 300 &quot;Adenauer&quot; saloon, and 220S &quot;ponton&quot; saloon.)

His worsening heart condition finally forced permanent retirement from competition in 1954. He bought a farm in Gloucestershire that included three houses: one was for himself and his family, one for his farm manager, and one for his bank manager. He continued to run his Maidenhead-based company Prototype Engineering, which produced precision components for the fledgling nuclear industry. Towards the end of his life he developed a keen interest in the &quot;Sport of Kings&quot; and owned several racehorses. 
Doug Nye recorded motor racing photographer Guy Griffiths&#x27;s personal recollection of Leslie Johnson:

:&quot;[Q]uite the most charming, friendly, unassuming and courteous man in motor racing... [His] furniture factory [was] an extremely paternalistic, caring concern, in which long-term employees were looked after virtually to the grave. When they became too old for their regular work they might be put onto lighter duties for a lesser wage, but there&#x27;d always be something for them, Johnson made sure of that.

:&quot;When he acquired ERA Ltd and re-established it at Dunstable he [employed] a number of old lags from pre-war racing who were looking for a job postwar. When he drove the E-Type, I think in the Isle of Man, Reg Parnell wandered over for a chat with Johnson, and absent-mindedly gave the car&#x27;s steering wheel a tweak, to discover VAAAST free-play. &#x27;You can&#x27;t race this Leslie, you&#x27;ll kill yourself&#x27;. &#x27;Oh yes, well, it takes a bit of getting used to but you know, the boys have worked so hard to get it ready I really feel I ought to give it a go...&#x27;.

:&quot;He apparently never complained, he was a very buttoned-up, stoical, philosophical chap...his final illness was very quick, and extremely painful for him, yet he never let it show [...] He was regarded as being straight as a die...a good fellow.&quot;

He was married to the widow of Anglo-French driver Pierre Maréchal, and stepfather to her son Christian Maréchal, an advertising copywriter, UK ultralight aviation pioneer and freelance journalist.

Leslie Johnson died in 1959, aged 46, at Foxcote House, the family&#x27;s home in the village of Foxcote, Gloucestershire, England.

===Rallies===

Johnson’s involvement in motor sport began and ended with rallying, and he was a member of the Rootes factory teams in four Monte Carlo Rallies and one Alpine Rally. Rootes Competition Manager Norman Garrad said Johnson &quot;knew more about the geometry of driving than anybody in the business . . . I used to sit beside Leslie and say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t give a damn who you are, you are never going to get round this one at this speed.&#x27; Thank God he always did.&quot;

Johnson&#x27;s rally results included:

*1937: Winner, Scottish Rally. Winner, Torquay Rally, BMW 328.
*1938: 3rd, RAC Rally, BMW 328.
*1939: 3rd, RAC Rally, BMW 328.
*1952: 3rd, RAC Rally, Jaguar XK120. Later disqualified after a protest for running without rear spats, despite the scrutineers having noted and agreed their removal.
*1953: Winner, Team Prize, Monte Carlo Rally, with Stirling Moss and Jack Imhof, Sunbeam-Talbot Mark IIAs. Class winner, Alpine Rally, Sunbeam Alpine Mark I.
*1954: Winner, Team Prize, Monte Carlo Rally, with Stirling Moss and Sheila van Damm, Sunbeam-Talbot Mark IIAs. During the rally Johnson suffered a heart attack. Norman Garrad, who was in the car with Johnson and navigator John Cutts, said: &quot;It was altogether typical of Johnson that he somehow persuaded his colleagues . . . to get to the end of the event before committing him to hospital in Monaco.&quot; He recalled that they arrived in Monte Carlo with Johnson &quot;absolutely unconscious&quot;, and that he nearly died that night in the hospital.

===Speed hill climbs===

Johnson competed in numerous British speed hill climbs in 1946. Notable results included:

* First and second, Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb International meeting 1 June; Talbot-Lago T150C and BMW 328. John Eason Gibson reported: &quot;It was noticeable that Johnson was one of the select few who deliberately slid their cars into the swerves, in preference to waiting for a centrifugally inspired slide to compel them to dice a bit…the high praise poured on Johnson by Sommer and Chiron, for his driving at Brussels, has been confirmed elsewhere.&quot;
*4th and 5th, Bugatti Owners Club Prescott Speed Hill Climb 23 June; Talbot-Lago and BMW 328.
*2nd, Bugatti Owners Club Prescott Speed Hill Climb 28 July; Talbot-Lago.
*First, FTD and course record, Scottish Sporting Club Bo&#x27;ness Speed Hill Climb 7 September; Talbot-Lago. Achieved on his first acquaintance with the course.
*3rd in class (to Sydney Allard&#x27;s Allard), Jersey Motor Club Bouley Bay Speed Hill Climb 17 October; Talbot-Lago.

===Racing: sports cars===

Johnson&#x27;s early races were with a BMW 328 and a Talbot-Lago T150C sports-racing car. Louis Chiron had driven the latter to victory in the 1937 Grand Prix de l&#x27;A.C.F. at Montlhéry. Johnson fitted extra fuel tanks in the tail and cockpit for long-distance racing.

*1946: 2nd overall and fastest lap, Brussels International Sports Car Race, Spa; BMW. &quot;The Motor&quot; reported his performance as that of &quot;a budding Dick Seaman&quot; and added: &quot;Sommer and Louis Chiron danced with fiendish glee as Johnson took the esses in a single controlled slide. Chiron said he had the flair of Nuvolari. Sommer, inarticulate with emotion, kissed the poor chap.&quot;
*1948: Winner, Spa 24 Hours; prototype Aston Martin shared with St. John Horsfall. Aston Martin&#x27;s first postwar victory.
*1949:
**3rd, Spa 24 Hours; Aston Martin DB2, partnered by Charles Brackenbury.
**Winner, Silverstone National Allcomers Race; Bentley 8 Litre owned by Forrest Lycett

His name is closely associated with Jaguar, particularly the XK120 model. The extraordinary competition history of his white car, road-registered as JWK 651, made it the world&#x27;s most valuable XK120 when it sold at auction for £230,000 ($350,000) in 2001.

His various successes with XK120s included the model&#x27;s first-ever victories in Europe and the United States:

*1949: Winner, Daily Express International Sports Car Race, Silverstone, the XK120&#x27;s first race, after an early collision with a spinning Jowett Javelin dropped Johnson to fifth.
*1950: Winner in class, 4th overall, Palm Beach Shores, Florida, SCCA sports car race – the XK120s first American race – despite losing the brakes. Johnson was granted an American racing licence for the event, as his entry was not sanctioned by the RAC, and the Jaguar was unmodified from standard specification. Jim McCraw wrote, &quot;In rain and high winds, the Jaguar finished fourth in a race that included three giants of American sports-car racing – Briggs Cunningham in a Cadillac-Healey, second; Phil Walters in a Healey, fifth; and Miles Collier in a Riley-Ford, sixth. Sam Collier finished eighth in one of the XK 120s, and Bill Spear DNF&#x27;d with no brakes in the third car.&quot; The success launched Jaguar in the US market.

Johnson&#x27;s Le Mans results: 

*1949: DNF, Aston Martin DB2, co-driver Charles Brackenbury. Retired from fifth place after six laps; overheating caused by water pump failure.
*1950: DNF, Jaguar XK120; clutch failure after 21 hours while lying third and catching the leader at a rate that would have seen the Jaguar in the lead before the full 24 hours had elapsed—an effort that convinced William Lyons it was worth investing in success at Le Mans. Explaining the clutch failure, Jim McCraw wrote: &quot;Leslie Johnson ran as high as second during the middle portion of the race, but, in order to save brake wear, he kept downshifting the transmission at high speeds and eventually blew the clutch, which prompted the substitution of a solid-disc clutch plate from then on.&quot;
*1951: DNF, Jaguar C-Type, co-driver Clemente Biondetti. Retired from third place after 50 laps; no oil pressure.
*1952: 3rd overall out of 57 starters, behind two factory-entered Mercedes-Benz W194 300SLs; first in class, ahead of triple Le Mans winner Luigi Chinetti&#x27;s Ferrari; second in Index of Performance; winner, Gold Challenge Cup. Nash-Healey (a lightweight competition version hastily constructed for the race—the body was fabricated in less than a week; the entire car built from scratch in a fortnight).
*1953: 11th out of 60 starters; Nash-Healey.

His Mille Miglia results:

*1950: 5th, Jaguar XK120. The best-ever result by an Englishman driving a British car, in this instance a production model beaten only by lightweight competition cars entered by Alfa Romeo (Fangio&#x27;s came third) and Ferrari.
*1951: DNF, Ferrari-Jaguar &quot;Biondetti Special&quot; shared with his 1951 Le Mans partner and four-time Mille Miglia winner Clemente Biondetti.
*1952: 7th to Bracco&#x27;s winning works team Ferrari, the works Mercedes-Benz 300SLs of Kling and Caracciola, and three works Lancias. Lightweight competition Nash-Healey, with Daily Telegraph motoring correspondent Bill McKenzie as passenger.
*1953: DNF, Jaguar C-Type.

===Racing: single-seaters===

Johnson raced Delage, Talbot-Lago and ERA cars in single-seater events between 1946 and 1950.

In August 1946, in his first drive in a &quot;proper&quot; racing car, albeit one that was already 20 years old, he broke the lap record at the Ards circuit (the Ulster venue of the RAC Tourist Trophy race from 1928 to 1936). The car was the supercharged straight-eight Delage previously raced by Earl Howe, Dick Seaman and Prince Bira. The clutch failed to release at the start so the car had to be pushed off the line. Having lost some 200 yards to the rest of the field, Johnson worked his way up to fourth behind Prince Bira, Reg Parnell and Bob Gerard but a spark plug melted four laps from the end, forcing him out. (He consoled himself with fastest average in the subsequent handicap race with his BMW 328.)

He entered three 1947 Grands Prix with his ten-year-old ex-Louis Chiron Talbot-Lago T150C – Johnson raced it both as a sports car and a single-seater, simply removing the mudguards to convert it to Grand Prix configuration. The results were:

*6th, Jersey International Road Race. Finished ahead of several Maserati and ERA single-seaters.
*7th, Belgian Grand Prix, Spa.
*DNF, Swiss Grand Prix, Bern. There was an almost total lack of crowd control, with the result that Achille Varzi&#x27;s Alfa Romeo killed one spectator on the track in practice, and Johnson pulled out of the race after his Talbot-Lago locked a brake entering a corner and tail-swiped the spectators, killing two. The following year, Varzi suffered a fatal accident in practice for the same event.

In November 1947 Leslie Johnson acquired English Racing Automobiles, together with one of their prewar ERA E-Type single-seaters. The car was fast but fragile, and Johnson&#x27;s 1948 results were disappointing despite a lap record and a fastest lap:
*DNF, Grand Prix du Salon, Montlhéry. Lap record and pole position, but the fuel tank split in the race.
*DNF, British Grand Prix, Silverstone. &quot;Autosport&quot; magazine reported that he posted fastest lap in the opening practice session, &quot;good enough for Johnson to be a front row man, and a potential winner!&quot; He was 5th on the starting grid. In the race, de Graffenried&#x27;s Maserati 4CL was fastest off the line. Before Woodcote, the first corner, Chiron&#x27;s Talbot-Lago T26C took the lead, followed by Parnell&#x27;s Maserati 4CLT and Johnson&#x27;s ERA. Entering Woodcote, Johnson drew level with Chiron. Then there was a &quot;crash and a bang&quot;&#x27; and the ERA &quot;rolled to a standstill . . . leaving a trail of flame and smoke in its wake.&quot; A driveshaft universal joint had failed.
*5th and fastest lap (shared with Parnell&#x27;s 4CLT Maserati), British Empire Trophy.

1949 saw three promising results from five entries:

*DNF, British Grand Prix, Silverstone—Britain&#x27;s first World Championship Grand Prix.
*5th, Richmond Trophy, Goodwood.
*3rd, Chichester Trophy.
*3rd, British Empire Trophy, despite broken rear shock-absorbers.
*DNS, Jersey Road Race. Second fastest to Italian champion Luigi Villoresi&#x27;s Maserati in practice, but engine bearing failure kept the car out of the race.

But in 1950 Johnson again found himself repeatedly sidelined by the car&#x27;s unreliability: 
*DNF, British Grand Prix, Silverstone. Started from the fourth row. The supercharger disintegrated after two laps and the car caught fire.

Other outings ended in steering failure and another split fuel tank.

Johnson&#x27;s ambitious and technically advanced E-Type successor, the G-Type ERA, was designed to race in both Grands Prix and Formula 2. The anticipated development funds did not materialise, and the car was unsuccessful even in the hands of Stirling Moss.

In 1951 Johnson was to have driven the new 600 bhp V16 BRM in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, but he was unable to reach the circuit in time for a pre-race test session in the very early morning. Hans Stuck took the drive but the car blew up in practice and did not race.

===Record-breaking===

Johnson set numerous world records with Jaguar sports cars at the Autodrome de Montlhéry, the banked oval track near Paris; most notably:

*1950: 107.46 mph for 24 hours, including stops for fuel and tyres, in Johnson’s Jaguar XK120 roadster JWK 651; co-driver Stirling Moss. The first time a production car had averaged over 100 mph for 24 hours. Johnson and Moss, driving in three-hour shifts, covered 2579.16 miles, with a best lap of 126.2 mph.
*1951: 131.83 miles in one hour, with a best lap of 134.43 mph; Johnson solo with the XK120. &quot;No mean feat...driving at almost twice today&#x27;s maximum &quot;(UK)&quot; speed limit into a steep turn, assaulted by the g-force induced by 30 degree banking twice every minute, using Forties technology, leaf spring suspension and narrow crossply tyres...Johnson remarked that the car felt so good it could have gone on for another week, an off-the-cuff comment that sowed the seed for another idea. Flat out for a week...
*1952: 100.31 mph for 7 days and 7 nights; Jaguar XK120 coupé; co-drivers Stirling Moss, Bert Hadley and Jack Fairman.
For the week-long 1952 marathon Jaguar&#x27;s founder, mindful of the considerable kudos and advertising mileage that had already accrued from Johnson&#x27;s efforts, commandeered a brand new gold-coloured XK120 FHC for him: it was Jaguar chief engineer Walter Hassan&#x27;s car, the second right-hand drive coupé made.

Moss recalled:

:&quot;...in mid-summer Leslie Johnson had another of his ideas. Having averaged 100mph for 24 hours at Montlhéry he now talked Jaguar into attempting 100mph for a week!...We again drove in three-hour spells. The speedbowl lap was under a minute at 120mph, so it was quite a strain. After each straight we hit the banking high up near the lip, then plunged off, twice every fifty seconds, night and day. In each spell we would cover about 2000 laps. It was impossible to keep one&#x27;s mind occupied on a job like that. We had a two-way radio which helped keep boredom at bay. We talked all the time, called each other names, even told stories. One dare not let the mind wander, because we were running within four feet of the banking lip at around 120mph. One had to concentrate on something. I worked out how many million revs the engine made in a day, how many times the wheels turned, things like that.

:The weather did not help; hot by day, cold at night. Night driving was a strain too, because we couldn&#x27;t afford the drain on the battery of extra lights. The headlights had to be set very high to let us see the top of the banking when we were on it, and this meant that on the short straights we could see nothing at all because the beams were playing in the air.

:We hit several hares, rabbits and birds, and Leslie swore at one point that he&#x27;d seen a huge ten-foot tall figure in a long cloak, wearing a tall pointed hat, striding toward him along the verge. Next time round the figure had gone...it worried the life out of him for the rest of his stint. In fact I had donned a Shell fuel funnel, pulled a tarpaulin around me and sat on Jack Fairman&#x27;s shoulders as he strode along the verge. After Leslie had whizzed by we ran away and hid...All very childish, but good fun in the circumstances. Leslie then had an extraordinary idea to get his own back during one of my stints. I came whistling off the banking to find him sitting with Jack Fairman in the middle of the track, playing cards!

:Then he took the pit signal board and put it out on the track, so that my natural line past the pits took me between it and the timekeeper&#x27;s hut. He was lounging beside the hut so I waved to him as I shot through the gap. Next time round the board had been moved closer to the hut. The gap was narrower, but I couldn&#x27;t leave the fast line so I shot through it again. Next time round, he&#x27;d moved the board closer still. Each lap he narrowed the gap which made me concentrate harder to pass through it. Eventually he gave in, and the board went back to its proper position, hung on the tent. At least it passed the time...&quot;

Montlhéry&#x27;s concrete surface was rough, and the Jaguar broke a spring when it was already well into the run. No spare was carried on board. Regulations stipulated that an outside replacement would make the car ineligible for any further records beyond those already achieved before the repair. Johnson drove nine hours to save the other drivers from added risk while the speed had to be maintained on the broken spring. When finally he stopped to have it replaced, the car had taken the World and Class C 72-hour records at 105.55 mph, World and Class C four-day records at 101.17 mph, Class C 10,000-kilometer record at 107.031 mph, World and Class C 15,000-kilometer records at 101.95 mph, and World and Class C 10,000-mile records at 100.65 mph. After the repair the car went on to complete the full seven days and nights, covering a total of 16,851.73 miles at an average speed of 100.31 mph.

In 1953 Rootes commissioned Johnson&#x27;s company ERA to modify a Sunbeam Alpine for Stirling Moss and Sheila van Damm to drive flat-out through a flying kilometre on the Jabbeke highway in Belgium, where Moss&#x27;s speed of established a new Belgian national record for cars of its class. Two days after the record runs, Johnson drove the car for an hour at an average speed of at Montlhéry, and Moss put in a lap at .

===High-speed run: 16 countries in 90 hours===

In December 1952 Johnson, Stirling Moss, rally driver David Humphrey, and navigator John Cutts crewed a Humber Super Snipe Mark IV on a journey from Oslo, Norway, to Lisbon, Portugal—a total of 16 countries and 3,380 miles—in 3 days, 17 hours and 59 minutes. The purpose was to publicise the car, which Rootes had introduced six weeks earlier as a new model for 1953. The company&#x27;s Competition Manager Norman Garrad, who had come up with the idea, hoped the trip might be completed in five days.

The team stopped only for meals, refuelling, driver changeovers, and to change a wheel after a puncture. With &quot;heroic driving, particularly from Stirling Moss and Leslie Johnson&quot; they finished at Lisbon 30 hours earlier than Garrad had expected, despite traffic, sheet ice, blizzards, and snowdrifts up to 18 inches deep en route. They took every opportunity to cruise at —Moss recalled that &quot;many times&quot; the speedometer indicated &quot;over ninety for a quarter of an hour at a stretch&quot;—and Johnson drove the last three hours to Lisbon at an average of .

<text>Annual publications, more often simply called annuals, are periodical publications appearing regularly once per year. Although exact definitions may vary, types of annuals include: calendars and almanacs, directories, yearbooks, annual reports, proceedings and transactions and literary annuals. A weekly or monthly publication may produce an &quot;Annual&quot; featuring similar materials to the regular publication. Some encyclopedias have published annual supplements that essentially summarize the news of the past year, similar to some newspaper yearbooks.

To libraries and collectors, annuals present challenges of size (tens or hundreds of volumes) and completeness (acquiring a sequence with no missing volumes). They are handled similar to serial publications, which typically means a single library catalog record for the title, not for individual years. The single record must then indicate which volumes (years) are held.

The mid- and late 20th century saw a sharp increase in the publication of annuals to report scientific results and provide overview, both in ever more specialized topics and in popular summary.

==History==
A new form of literary work called the &quot;Annual&quot; was a fad from about 1823 through 1857 and became so popular that they were soon published up to 17 times a year. British royalty increased their popularity. They closely resemble many college literary &quot;books&quot; just produced for college campus today, except they contained many etchings of beautiful women from steel plates. They were the fashion magazines of the day. Later it became fashionable to watercolor the etchings and the &quot;Annuals&quot; became early coloring books. There was later a backlash against &quot;beauty&quot; and the fad ended, as did steel plate etchings for books.

&quot;The Annual&quot; was a long-running fad from 1824 until 1857 which started in England, but spilled over into the U.S. Steel plates of the 1820s allowed book publishers to mass-produce pictures. What started out as an &quot;annual book&quot; or a gift for the holidays turned into something that had up to 17 editions through the year (yet were still called annuals). Countess Blessington and other royal women contributed to the works and altered fashion. This fad was sometimes referred to as &quot;beauty&quot;, as books with plates of women defined the content.
In one book, the steel plate was damaged and another picture of a woman was simply used as a replacement. The illustrations often had nothing to do with the text content. The content of the text was often of poor quality and &quot;The American Book of Beauty&quot; contained a story of prison torture with an illustration of a pretty woman with a lapdog. &quot;The American Book of Beauty&quot; also has several copies of the books with portraits in different orders. One edition of the &quot;Heath&#x27;s Book of Beauty&quot; was a college project and contained poems, short stories, etc. 1826 was not a good year for the annuals, because of the Panic of 1825. Thomas Hood&#x27;s sarcastic poem &quot;The Battle of the Annuals&quot; was published in the 1830s. Watercolor became popular in the 1830s and the black and white etchings were the coloring books of the day. In 1842, Volume 1, page 521 of the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, there are sarcastic pictures poking fun at the annuals. In 1844 there was an article referring to it as &quot;imbecilic mania&quot; and finally the &quot;Obituary for the Annual&quot; appeared in the Art Journal of 1857. The death of the annuals and new photo techniques replacing etching ended most engravers&#x27; careers.

==Yearbooks==

A yearbook is a volume that summarizes events of the past year. One of the earliest is &quot;The Annual Register&quot;, published in London since 1758. A forerunner is Abel Boyer&#x27;s &quot;The Political State of Great Britain&quot; (38 volumes, 1711–29). Later examples include &quot;The Statesman&#x27;s Yearbook&quot; (since 1864) and the &quot;Daily Mail Year Book&quot; (since 1901). Two early German titles are &quot;Europäischer Geschichtskalender&quot;, founded in 1861 by Heinrich Schulthess and Gottlob Egelhaaf&#x27;s &quot;Historisch-politische Jahresübersicht&quot; (28 volumes, 1908–1936).

==Comic books==
In the case of comic books, an annual is an extra issue that corresponds with an ongoing series, providing story material in addition to the customary 12 issues per year of a monthly series and filling holes in a publishing schedule that are usually created when a fifth release day falls in a month. A comic book annual customarily has a larger page count than its monthly counterpart, leaving room for longer single stories, biographical information on featured characters, full-page pin-ups of characters, reprints of previously published material, and/or all-new short stories (often called &quot;back-up&quot; stories). Chase Magnett, for &quot;ComicBook.com&quot;, highlighted that &quot;annuals are ultimately best defined by being what the monthly issues are not&quot; and that &quot;the only consistency surrounding the concept of these special sorts of issues is that they have been around in some form or another just about as long as superhero comics have been published&quot;. An annual is considered a separate series for purposes of numbering and collectability; a particular periodical&#x27;s &quot;Annual&quot; will thus have its own numbering series, or alternately be referred to by the year of its publication. As a result, annuals are much less valuable as collectables than other comic books, since collectors do not view them as part of a complete series run.

Comic book annuals originally were little more than reprint albums (for example &quot;Superman Annual&quot; #1, August 1960), representing stories that had first seen publication in their monthly counterparts, but eventually, this changed to annuals featuring primarily all-new material (the first example being &quot;Fantastic Four Annual&quot; #1, July 1963). Later annuals often featured stories with greater import to the characters featured than in the monthly publications, reflecting the &quot;special&quot; status of their once-yearly publication. Most annuals consisted of standalone stories that did not fit in with the then-current thrust of the monthly series&#x27; storyline.

In the late 1980s and much of the 1990s, annuals published by Marvel Comics and DC Comics were usually released in the summer of the year and often had a unifying theme, either a similar theme that individual stories were written around, or a crossover storyline bringing many of the characters in the individual publishers&#x27; continuities together for a single overall event. In the case of the &quot;crossover&quot; annuals, the number of characters and annuals involved in a crossover story varied. Some were company-wide, incorporating virtually every character in the publisher&#x27;s shared universe whose series received an annual edition. Most of those which used smaller groups of characters were specific to teams or &quot;extended families&quot; of characters; annual crossovers with no preexisting connection between the characters do exist, such as Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Lifeform&quot; from 1990, but are comparatively rare.

Annuals published by DC and particularly Marvel became fewer and far between by the late 1990s, mainly due to the near-collapse of the comic book industry in the wake of the speculator boom; annuals were seen as an unnecessary risk in a climate where many monthly publications were in danger of cancellation for lack of sales (especially at Marvel, which filed for bankruptcy at this time). When the industry began to recover from the &quot;bust&quot;, annuals began re-appearing on occasion, but by no means as regularly as before the &quot;bust&quot;, when numbered series of annuals had reached the tens or twenties, indicating over a decade of regular publication.

Currently, the comic book annual is still something of a rarity, its purpose in presenting &quot;extra&quot; material often served by &quot;Special Edition&quot;s that are released at random intervals rather than the set yearly schedule of an annual. Annuals often allow new talent to develop a story for A-list characters which &quot;creates an opportunity for a rising star to encounter the dedicated fanbase associated with these series, developing overlap that can expand the audience for talented new voices and grow the publisher&#x27;s concept of who should be part of their top tier of creators&quot;. In 2017, Katie Schenkel, for &quot;Book Riot&quot;, highlighted that annuals are &quot;less common that they were 20 or 30 years ago, but when companies decide to put them out for specific series the annuals are often out towards the end of summer. Comic story arcs tend to be around six issues long, and annuals fit in between one arc and the next&quot;.

===United Kingdom===

In the U.K., a large number of annuals are published shortly before the end of each year by companies such as D. C. Thomson, Egmont (formerly IPC/Fleetway), and Rebellion Developments, aimed at the Christmas market. These annuals are generally large-sized hardcover books with over 100 pages and a high color content. They are normally cover-dated with the following year&#x27;s date to ensure that stockists do not remove them from their shelves immediately after the new year.

One of the earliest annuals was issued in 1822. Frederic Shoberl was the founding editor of Ackermann″s &quot;The Forget-me-not&quot;, which was an early annual, a then-new type of publication in England. Shoberl continued to edit the annual until 1834. A junior version called &quot;The Juvenile Forget-me-not&quot; was published from 1828 onward.

For many years until the near-collapse of the British children&#x27;s comics market, an annual would be published each year for each of the comic titles published by Thomson and IPC/Fleetway, featuring extra adventures of the comic&#x27;s current and former characters, plus additional material in the form of puzzles, text articles, etc. Annuals were often even published for comics which had themselves ceased publication or been absorbed into other titles; for example, &quot;Scorcher&quot; annuals were still being published 10 years after the comic itself had been absorbed into &quot;Tiger&quot;. Today, this section of the market has been reduced to just a couple of surviving titles.

In addition, annuals are often published centered on sports, toys, currently-popular celebrities, recently released films, and popular TV series. In the period of the 1950s to the 1980s, companies like World Distributors, Brown Watson, and Grandreams were known for publishing annuals based on licensed characters and properties. British annuals are also published featuring American characters such as Spider-Man, often with simplified content aimed at younger readers. As tastes in these areas change, so does the line-up of annuals released each year. The increasing emphasis in recent years on annuals of this type (as opposed to the &quot;classic&quot; line-up of annuals based on comics) means that sales remain strong, and, in fact, they doubled between 1998 and 2005. Some annuals have become extremely collectible, especially &quot;The Beano&quot;, &quot;The Dandy&quot;, &quot;Rupert&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot;.

<doc id="1235003" wikidata="Q2904427" url="?curid=1235003" title="Birdie Tebbetts">
<text>George Robert &quot;Birdie&quot; Tebbetts (November 10, 1912 – March 24, 1999) was an American professional baseball player, manager, scout and front office executive. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher for the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox and the Cleveland Indians from 1936 to 1952. Tebbetts was regarded as the best catcher in the American League in the late 1940s.

Although he lacked speed and did not hit for power, Tebbetts was an exceptional defensive catcher and intelligent player who capably directed his pitchers. These traits served him well later in his career, as he became the manager for the Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Braves and the Cleveland Indians. His major league career encompassed 14 years as a catcher, 11 as a manager and 28 as a scout.

==Early life==
Tebbetts was born in Burlington, Vermont, but his family moved to Nashua, New Hampshire a few months after he was born. Shortly thereafter, his father died, leaving his mother to raise the family. Some reports state that Tebbetts acquired his nickname as a boy after an aunt observed that his voice sounded like a bird chirping, while other reports state the nickname was acquired while attending Providence College.

Tebbetts was a star athlete at Nashua High School where he attained All-State status as a football quarterback and as a baseball catcher. He signed a contract with the Detroit Tigers after they agreed to pay his college tuition. He attended Providence College where he became an All-American in baseball before graduating with a degree in philosophy in 1934.

==Baseball career==
The Tigers purchased future Hall of Fame catcher Mickey Cochrane from the Philadelphia Athletics in December 1933, leaving no place for Tebbetts on the team. He spent the next three seasons playing in the minor leagues before making his MLB debut with the Tigers on September 16, 1936 at the age of 23. In the 1937 season, Cochrane&#x27;s playing career came to an end when he was hit by a pitch and suffered a fractured skull. Rudy York replaced Cochrane as the Tigers&#x27; catcher, but his defensive skills were so poor that by the 1939 season, new Tigers manager Del Baker gave Tebbetts a chance to play. He ended the season with a .261 batting average and led American League (AL) catchers in assists and in baserunners caught stealing.

In 1940, York was converted into a first baseman, leaving Tebbetts in sole possession of the catcher&#x27;s position. He responded by posting a .296 batting average, as the Tigers defeated the Cleveland Indians and the New York Yankees in a tight pennant race to clinch the American League title. Tebbetts was held hitless in the 1940 World Series as the Tigers lost to the Cincinnati Reds in a seven-game series. He once again led AL catchers in assists and in baserunners caught stealing. In September, Tebbetts had been charged with assault and battery during a game in Cleveland when a basket of tomatoes was dropped on him by a Cleveland fan. As police held the fan, Tebbetts rushed up and struck him. The charges were later dismissed. He developed a reputation for antagonizing opposing players, constantly hectoring them in an effort to have them make mistakes and give his team an advantage.

In 1941, Tebbetts was hitting for a .296 average by mid-season and earned a place as a reserve player for the American League in the 1941 All-Star Game. He led American League catchers in assists for a third consecutive year. Tebbetts was named the starting catcher for the American League in the 1942 All-Star Game.
Despite holding a 3-A draft classification because of his mother&#x27;s dependency, Tebbetts applied for an Army Air Corps commission. He joined the military services in August 1942 and was assigned to recruiting duties in Waco, Texas during the Second World War. Tebbetts honed his managerial skills as a player-manager for the Waco Army Flying School&#x27;s baseball team. He lost three years of his baseball career to his military service.

After his discharge from the military, Tebbetts returned to play for the Tigers in 1946, posting a .243 batting average in 86 games. He was hitting for only a .094 average in May 1947 when he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for catcher Hal Wagner. After the trade, Tebbetts hit for a .299 average for the remainder of the season. There were reports in July 1947 that the Red Sox were considering Tebbetts as a successor to their manager, Joe Cronin. He was hitting for a .286 average at mid-season in 1948 and was named as a reserve catcher for the American League in the 1948 All-Star Game. The Red Sox finished the season in a first place tie with the Cleveland Indians before losing the pennant in a one-game playoff at Fenway Park.

Tebbetts was elected to be the starting catcher for the American League in the 1949 All-Star Game. He hit for a .270 average in 1949 as the Red Sox engaged the New York Yankees in a tight battle for the pennant that was not decided until the final game of the season. The Red Sox had a one-game lead with two games left to play in the season, but lost the final two games of the season against their New York rivals to once again finish in second place.

In 1950, the 37-year-old Tebbetts shared catching duties with Matt Batts as he posted a career-high .310 batting average in 84 games. The Red Sox were once again involved in a tight pennant race before faltering to finish in third place in the standings. At a public speaking engagement in October, Tebbetts defended Red Sox manager Steve O&#x27;Neill from criticism he received from some of the Red Sox players. In his speech, Tebbetts called the critics &quot;a couple of juvenile delinquents and moronic malcontents.&quot; His comments created friction within the team and two months later, his contract was sold to the Cleveland Indians. He spent the final two seasons of his career as a backup catcher for perennial All-Star Jim Hegan. Tebbetts played his final major league game on September 14, 1952 at the age of 38 although in a news report in December 1952, Tebbetts admitted that his actual age was 43, saying that he subtracted five years off his age after he left college.

==Career statistics==
In a fourteen-year major league career, Tebbetts played in 1,162 games, accumulating 1,000 hits in 3,704 at bats for a .270 career batting average along with 38 home runs, 469 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .341. He ended his career with a .978 fielding percentage. A four-time All-Star, Tebbetts led American League catchers four times in range factor, three times in assists, twice in baserunners caught stealing, and once in putouts. Before the arrival of Hall of Fame catcher, Carlton Fisk, Tebbetts was voted the Red Sox&#x27; all-time best catcher in a 1969 fan poll — a remarkable feat, considering that he spent only four years with the Red Sox.

==Managerial and executive career==

In December 1952, the Indians General Manager, Hank Greenberg, named Tebbetts as the manager of the Indianapolis Indians. After Tebbetts guided Indianapolis to a fourth-place finish in 1953, he was hired by Gabe Paul to replace Rogers Hornsby as the manager of the Cincinnati Reds. After leading the Reds to fifth-place finishes in 1954 and 1955, Tebbetts led the team to a surprising third-place finish in 1956. The Reds were in first place at mid-season and stayed in the pennant race until the last day of the season, ending up with a 91–63 record, two games behind the Brooklyn Dodgers. For his efforts, the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America voted Tebbetts as the 1956 Manager of the Year. The Reds rewarded him with a three-year contract in December.

In 1957, Tebbetts had the Reds in first place at mid-season, earning him a place on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in July of that year. The Reds faltered during the second half of the season and faded to finish in fourth place. Frank Robinson gave Tebbetts credit for his performance during the 1957 season saying, &quot;He kept after me all year and that&#x27;s what a young ball player needs.&quot; In 1958, the Reds fell into last place and Tebbetts announced his resignation on August 14.

In October 1958, Tebbetts was hired as an executive vice president for the Milwaukee Braves. He served in the Braves front office from 1959 through September 1961, but found that he missed the excitement of being on the playing field. When the team fired Chuck Dressen in September 1961, Tebbetts returned to managing for the last month of the season. Ironically, his former team, the Cincinnati Reds, would win the National League pennant that year. Despite having talented players like Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, Joe Adcock, Warren Spahn, and Lew Burdette, Tebbetts could manage only a fifth-place finish in 1962.

In October 1962, Tebbetts signed a three-year contract to manage the Cleveland Indians, saying that he felt he owed a long-standing debt to new Indians General Manager, Gabe Paul. After managing the Indians to a fifth-place finish in 1963, he suffered a heart attack during spring training in Tucson, Arizona on April 1, 1964. Just three months later, he returned to manage the team. After a fifth-place finish in 1965, Tebbetts led the Indians to fourteen victories in their first fifteen games of the 1966 season, but the team faltered and fell fifteen games out of first place before he resigned as manager in August. Tommy John remembered Tebbetts&#x27;s advice for pitchers when they faced hitters they really struggled against: tell the hitter exactly what they were going to throw. This was meant to confuse the hitter, who would be unsure whether to believe the pitcher or not.

In eleven seasons as a major league manager, Tebbetts compiled a 748–705 win–loss record. He returned to the minor leagues as a manager in 1967, managing the Marion Mets in the Appalachian League. From 1968 to 1997, Tebbetts scouted for the New York Mets, New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles and the Florida Marlins. His baseball acuity earned him a reputation as one of the most respected scouts in professional baseball. Reggie Jackson credited Tebbetts&#x27; scouting reports for helping him hit three home runs in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. He retired in 1997, having spent 60 years in baseball, including 53 years in the majors.

===Managerial Record===
==Later life==
Tebbetts moved to Anna Maria, Florida in the early 1960s. He was appointed to the Veterans Committee of the Baseball Hall of Fame in February 1979. He received the Judge Emil Fuchs Award in 1986 for his long and meritorious service in baseball.

Perhaps most revealing of Tebbetts&#x27;s character is his recollection of an umpire who suffered dizzy spells following his return from the war. Afraid of losing his job, the umpire asked Tebbetts, then the Tigers catcher, to help calling balls and strikes, and Tebbetts tipped him off with hand signals following each pitch.

Birdie Tebbetts died on March 24, 1999, in Bradenton, Florida, at the age of 86. On May 28, 2009, Birdie was announced as a Local Legend of Nashua, New Hampshire, and commemorated with a plaque to be placed in Holman Stadium.

<doc id="1235008" wikidata="Q242469" url="?curid=1235008" title="Mary Jane Kelly">
<text>Mary Jane Kelly ( – 9 November 1888), also known as Marie Jeanette Kelly, Fair Emma, Ginger, Dark Mary and Black Mary, is widely believed by scholars to have been the final victim of the notorious unidentified serial killer Jack the Ripper, who murdered at least five women in the Whitechapel and Spitalfields districts of London from late August to early November 1888. At the time of Kelly&#x27;s death, she was approximately 25 years old, working as a prostitute and living in relative poverty.

Unlike the other four canonical Ripper victims—each of whom had been murdered outdoors and whose mutilations could have been committed within minutes—Kelly was murdered within the sparsely furnished single room she rented at 13 Miller&#x27;s Court, affording her murderer an extensive period of time to eviscerate and mutilate her body. Kelly&#x27;s body was by far the most extensively mutilated of the canonical victims, with her mutilations taking her murderer approximately two hours to perform.

==Early life==
Compared with the other four canonical Ripper victims, Mary Kelly&#x27;s origins are obscure and undocumented, and much of this information is possibly embellished. Kelly may have fabricated many details of her early life as there is no corroborating documentary evidence, but there is no evidence to the contrary either. According to Joseph Barnett, the man she had most recently lived with prior to her murder, Kelly had told him she was born in Limerick, Ireland, in around 1863—although whether she referred to the city or the county is not known—and that her family moved to Wales when she was a child.

Kelly is known to have claimed to one acquaintance that her parents had disowned her, although she remained on close terms with her sister. She described her family to Barnett as moderately wealthy, and both he and a reported former landlady of Kelly&#x27;s, Mrs Carthy, claimed that Kelly came from a family of &quot;well-to-do people&quot;. Barnett reported that Kelly had informed him her father was named John Kelly and that he worked in an ironworks in either Caernarfonshire or Carmarthenshire. Barnett also recalled Kelly mentioning having seven brothers and at least one sister. One brother, named Henry, supposedly served in the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards. She once stated to a friend named Lizzie Albrook that a female family member was employed at the London theatrical stage. Her landlord, John McCarthy, also claimed that Kelly received infrequent correspondence from Ireland.

Carthy described Kelly as being &quot;an excellent scholar and an artist of no mean degree&quot;. However, at the inquest into Kelly&#x27;s murder, Barnett informed the coroner that in the months prior to her murder, she had often asked him to read newspaper reports of the Whitechapel murders to her, suggesting that she was illiterate.

Newspaper accounts dating from November 1888 claim Kelly was known as &quot;Mary McCarthy&quot;, which may have been a mix up with either the surname of her landlord at the time of her death or the surname of a previous landlady with whom she had lived until about 1886.

==Appearance==
Kelly has been reported as being a blonde or redhead, although her nickname &quot;Black Mary&quot; may suggest she had dark hair. Her eyes were blue. To some, Kelly was known as &quot;Fair Emma&quot;, although it is unknown whether this applied to her hair colour, her skin colour, her beauty, or other qualities. Some contemporary newspapers report she was nicknamed &quot;Ginger&quot; after her hair (though sources disagree even on this point, thus leaving a description of hair colour ranging from ash blonde to dark chestnut).

Contemporary reports estimated Kelly&#x27;s height at . Detective Walter Dew, in his autobiography, claimed to have known Kelly well by sight. He described her as &quot;quite attractive&quot; and &quot;a pretty, buxom girl&quot;. According to Dew, she always wore a clean white apron but never a hat. Sir Melville Macnaghten of the Metropolitan Police Force (who never saw Kelly prior to her death) said she had &quot;considerable personal attractions&quot;. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of 10 November 1888 described her as &quot;tall, slim, fair, of fresh complexion, and of attractive appearance&quot;.

==Marriage==
When Kelly was aged approximately 16 in about 1879, she reportedly married a coal miner named Davis or Davies, who was killed two or three years later in a mining explosion. Without any means of financial support, Kelly relocated to Cardiff, where she lived with a cousin. Although there are no contemporary records of Kelly&#x27;s presence in Cardiff, it is at this stage in her life that Kelly is considered to have begun her career as a prostitute, possibly being introduced to this profession by her cousin. No South Wales Police records exist to indicate Kelly was arrested for prostitution.

==Relocation to London==
In 1884, Kelly apparently left Cardiff and relocated to London, where she briefly worked for a tobacconist in Chelsea before securing employment as a domestic servant while lodging in Crispin Street, Spitalfields. The following year, Kelly is believed to have relocated to the central London district of Fitzrovia.

Via her acquaintance with a young French woman whom Kelly had met in Knightsbridge, she found work in a high-class brothel in the more affluent West End of London. She became one of the brothel&#x27;s most popular girls and spent her earnings on expensive clothing and hiring a carriage. Reportedly, Kelly was invited by a client named Francis Craig to France, but returned to England within approximately two weeks, having disliked her life there. However, by the time of her return to London, Kelly had adopted the French name &quot;Marie Jeanette&quot;.

==East End==
In 1885, Kelly briefly resided with a Mrs. Buki in lodgings near the London Docks North Quay. In the brief period of time she lodged with Buki, the two are known to have visited the home of a French lady living in Knightsbridge to demand the return of a box of expensive dresses belonging to Kelly. This information suggests Kelly&#x27;s descent into East End life was markedly rapid and may have been influenced by her efforts to avoid retribution from a procurer. It is also believed to be at this stage in her life when Kelly began drinking heavily.

After leaving Buki&#x27;s residence, Kelly lodged with a Mrs. Carthy in Breezer&#x27;s Hill, Ratcliffe Highway. According to Carthy, Kelly lived at her residence between 1885 and 1886, before leaving to live with a builder whom Carthy thought would have married Kelly. Gravitating toward the poorer areas of the East End, Kelly reportedly lived with a man named Morganstone near the Commercial Gas Works in Stepney and later with a mason&#x27;s plasterer named Joseph Flemming.

==Acquaintance with Joseph Barnett==
By 1886, Kelly was residing at Cooley&#x27;s Lodging House in Thrawl Street, Spitalfields. On 8 April 1887, she became acquainted with 28-year-old Joseph Barnett, whom she first encountered on Commercial Street. Barnett—who worked as a fish porter at Billingsgate Market—took Kelly for a drink before arranging to meet her the following day.

===Relationship and lodgings===
The two agreed to live together upon their second meeting on 9 April. Initially, Barnett and Kelly lodged in George Street, close to Commercial Street. They later took lodgings in Little Paternoster Row, but were soon evicted for non-payment of rent and drunk and disorderly conduct. They later took lodgings in Brick Lane, before relocating to Miller&#x27;s Court, off Dorset Street, in either February or March 1888.

==13 Miller&#x27;s Court==
In early 1888, Kelly and Barnett moved into 13 Miller&#x27;s Court, a small, sparsely furnished single room at the back of 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. This room had once been the back parlour of 26 Dorset Street and was partitioned by a wooden wall. The weekly rent for this room was 4s 6d.

Number 13 Miller&#x27;s Court was a single twelve-foot square room, with a bed, three tables and a chair. Above the fireplace hung a print of &quot;The Fisherman&#x27;s Widow&quot;, and a small tin bath was beneath the bed. Two irregularly sized windows faced the yard, in which the dustbin and water tap serving the property were located, and the door opened directly into the twenty-six-foot-long arched passageway which connected Miller&#x27;s Court with Dorset Street. This door was illuminated at night by a gas lamp located almost directly opposite the door to the property.

Kelly had lost her door key, instead bolting and unbolting the door from outside by putting a hand through a broken window beside the door. A German neighbour, Julia Venturney, claimed Kelly had broken this window when drunk, and that a man&#x27;s coat was frequently placed in this broken windowpane to both act as a curtain and prevent draught from entering the room.

According to Kelly&#x27;s friend and neighbour, Lizzie Albrook, Kelly was &quot;heartily sick&quot; of the life she was leading by 1888 and wished to return to Ireland &quot;where her people lived&quot;. Her landlord, John McCarthy, later recollected: &quot;She was a very quiet woman when sober but noisy when in drink.&quot; When drunk, Kelly would often be heard singing Irish songs, although when intoxicated, she would often become quarrelsome and even abusive to those around her, which earned her the nickname &quot;Dark Mary&quot;.

Barnett lost his employment as a fish porter in July 1888, reportedly due to committing theft. As a result, Kelly again resorted to prostitution. According to Barnett, she began to allow other prostitutes to sleep in their room on &quot;cold, bitter nights&quot; as she did not have the heart to refuse them shelter. Initially, Barnett was tolerant of this until he and Kelly quarrelled over her sharing the room with a prostitute he knew only as &quot;Julia&quot;. Barnett subsequently left 13 Miller&#x27;s Court on 30 October, more than a week before her death, taking lodgings at 24–25 New Street, Bishopsgate. Nonetheless, between 1 and 8 November, Barnett visited Kelly on an almost daily basis, occasionally giving her money.

===8 November===
Barnett visited Kelly for the last time between 7 and 8 p.m. on 8 November. He found her in the company of a friend of hers named Maria Harvey. Barnett did not stay at the property for long and apologised for having no money to give her. Both he and Harvey left Miller&#x27;s Court at about the same time. Barnett returned to his lodging house, where he played cards with other residents until falling asleep at about 12:30 a.m. Shortly before Barnett left Miller&#x27;s Court, Lizzie Albrook also visited Kelly. She later recollected that Kelly was sober, and one of the last things she had said to her was: &quot;Whatever you do, don&#x27;t you do wrong and turn out as I have.&quot; In the early evening, Kelly is known to have had one drink in the Ten Bells public house with a woman named Elizabeth Foster. Later that evening, Kelly was seen drinking with two acquaintances at the Horn of Plenty pub on Dorset Street.

Fellow Miller&#x27;s Court resident and prostitute, 31-year-old Mary Ann Cox, who described herself as &quot;a widow and unfortunate&quot;, reported seeing Kelly returning home drunk and in the company of a stout, ginger-haired man, aged approximately 36, at 11:45 p.m. This man was wearing a black felt bowler hat, had a thick moustache, blotches on his face, and was carrying a can of beer. Cox and Kelly wished each other goodnight, with Kelly adding, &quot;I am going to have a song.&quot; Kelly then entered her room with the man, who closed the door as Cox returned to her own lodgings at 5 Miller&#x27;s Court. Kelly was then heard singing the song &quot;A Violet from Mother&#x27;s Grave.&quot; She was still singing when Cox left her lodgings at midnight, and when she returned approximately one hour later, at 1 a.m. Elizabeth Prater resided in the room directly above Kelly. When she went to bed at 1:30 a.m., the singing had stopped.

===9 November===
Unemployed labourer George Hutchinson, who knew Kelly, reported the two had met at about 2 a.m. on 9 November on Flower and Dean Street and that Kelly asked him for a loan of sixpence. Hutchinson claimed to be broke, having spent his money in Romford the previous day. He later stated that as Kelly walked in the direction of Thrawl Street she was approached by a man of &quot;Jewish appearance&quot; and aged about 34 or 35. Hutchinson claimed he was suspicious of this man because, although Kelly seemed to know him, this individual&#x27;s opulent appearance made him a suspicious character to be in the neighbourhood. The man had also made an obvious effort to disguise his features from Hutchinson by &quot;[hiding] down his head with his hat over his eyes&quot; as the two had passed him.

Hutchinson later provided the police with an extremely detailed description of the man right down to the colour of his eyelashes despite it being the early hours of the morning. He reported that he overheard them talking in the street opposite the court where Kelly was living; Kelly complained of losing her handkerchief, and the man gave her a red one of his own. Hutchinson claimed that he then heard Kelly state: &quot;Alright my dear, come along. You will be comfortable.&quot; She and the man walked into 13 Miller&#x27;s Court, and Hutchinson followed them. He saw neither one of them again, laying off his watch at about 2:45 a.m.

Hutchinson&#x27;s statement appears to be partly corroborated by a laundress named Sarah Lewis, who reported that as she walked towards the courtyard at 2:30 a.m. to spend the night with her friends, the Keylers, who resided at 2 Miller&#x27;s Court, she had observed two or three people standing near the Britannia pub, including a respectably dressed young man with a dark moustache talking with a woman. Both appeared to be drunk. A poorly dressed and hatless young woman also stood nearby. Opposite Miller&#x27;s Court, Lewis observed a &quot;stout-looking and not very tall&quot; man standing at the entrance to the courtyard, observing the entranceway. As Lewis passed this man, she observed a man in the company of an obviously drunk woman further up the courtyard. Lewis was adamant as to the timing of these sightings as she recalled hearing the chiming of the Spitalfields Church clock.

Shortly after 1 a.m., Mary Ann Cox again left her room. She returned to her home at approximately 3 a.m. Cox reported hearing no sound and seeing no light from Kelly&#x27;s room at this time, although she thought she heard someone leaving the residence at about 5:45 a.m.

==Murder==
Elizabeth Prater, who resided in the room directly above Kelly&#x27;s and who had been awoken by her kitten walking over her neck, and Sarah Lewis, who had slept at number 2 Miller&#x27;s Court on 8–9 November, both reported hearing a faint cry of &quot;Murder!&quot; between 3:30 a.m. and 4 a.m., but did not react because they reported that it was common to hear such cries in the East End. Lewis described this cry as &quot;only one scream. I took no notice of it&quot;. She claimed not to have slept and to have heard people moving in and out of the court throughout the night. Prater did leave her room at approximately 5:30 a.m., to walk to the Ten Bells pub for a drink of rum. She saw nothing suspicious.

===Discovery===

On the morning of 9 November 1888, the day of the annual Lord Mayor&#x27;s Day celebrations, Kelly&#x27;s landlord, John McCarthy, sent his assistant, ex-soldier Thomas Bowyer, to collect the rent. Kelly was six weeks behind on her payments, owing 29 shillings. Shortly after 10:45 a.m., Bowyer knocked on her door but received no response. He then attempted to turn the handle, only to discover the door was locked. Bowyer then looked through the keyhole, but could not see anybody in the room. Pushing aside the clothing used to plug the broken windowpane and the muslin curtains which covered the windows, Bowyer peered inside the room—discovering Kelly&#x27;s extensively mutilated corpse lying on the bed. She is believed to have died between three and nine hours before the discovery of her body.

Bowyer ran to report his discovery to McCarthy, who first verified his claims, then instructed Bowyer to inform the Commercial Street Police Station. Bowyer ran to the police station, stammering the words: &quot;Another one. Jack the Ripper. Awful. [John] McCarthy sent me&quot; to Inspector Walter Beck. Beck accompanied Bowyer to Miller&#x27;s Court, and immediately requested the assistance of police surgeon George Bagster Phillips. He also gave orders preventing any individuals from entering or exiting the yard. Beck also arranged for news of the murder to be telegraphed to Scotland Yard, and requested the assistance of bloodhounds. The scene was attended by Superintendent Thomas Arnold and Inspector Edmund Reid from Whitechapel&#x27;s H Division, as well as Frederick Abberline and Robert Anderson from Scotland Yard, who arrived at the crime scene between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m.

News of the discovery of another Ripper victim spread rapidly throughout the East End. Crowds estimated to number over 1,000 gathered at each end of Dorset Street, with many members of the public voicing their frustration and indignation at the news.

Arnold ordered the room broken into at 1:30 p.m. after the possibility of tracking the murderer from the room with bloodhounds was dismissed as impractical. A fire fierce enough to melt the solder between a kettle and its spout had burnt in the grate, apparently fuelled with women&#x27;s clothing. Inspector Abberline thought Kelly&#x27;s clothes were burnt by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle Kelly had purchased on 7 November.

After two official crime scene photographs had been taken, Kelly&#x27;s body was taken from Miller&#x27;s Court to the mortuary in Shoreditch, where her body was formally identified by Joseph Barnett, who was only able to recognise Kelly&#x27;s body by &quot;the ear and the eyes&quot;. John McCarthy also viewed the body at the mortuary and was also certain the deceased was Kelly.
==Post-mortem==
The mutilation of Kelly&#x27;s corpse was by far the most extensive of any of the Whitechapel murders, likely because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room, without fear of discovery over an extensive period of time, as opposed to in public areas. The autopsy of Kelly&#x27;s body took two-and-a-half-hours to complete.

Thomas Bond and George Bagster Phillips examined the body. Phillips and Bond timed her death to about 12 hours before the examination. Phillips suggested that the extensive mutilations would have taken two hours to perform, and Bond noted that rigor mortis set in as they were examining the body, indicating that death occurred between 2 and 8 a.m. Bond&#x27;s official documents pertaining to his examination of the decedent, the crime scene, and subsequent post-mortem state:

Phillips believed that Kelly had been killed by a slash to the throat and the mutilations performed afterward. Bond stated in a report that the knife used was about wide and at least long, but did not believe that the murderer had any medical training or knowledge. He wrote:
==Inquest==
The official inquest into Kelly&#x27;s death was opened at the Shoreditch Town Hall on Monday 12 November. This inquest was presided over by the coroner for North East Middlesex, Roderick Macdonald, MP. The jury were duly sworn before being taken by Inspector Abberline to both view Kelly&#x27;s body at the mortuary adjoining Shoreditch Church and the crime scene in Miller&#x27;s Court. After approximately one hour, the jurors reconvened at Shoreditch Town Hall to hear witness testimony.

===Character testimony===
The first witness to testify was Joseph Barnett, who testified he had lived with Kelly for &quot;one year and eight months&quot; before the two had separated following a quarrel on 30 October over her allowing &quot;a woman of bad character&quot; to stay in her room, whom Kelly &quot;took in out of compassion&quot;. Barnett explained that, despite this argument, he had remained on good terms with Kelly in the week following their separation, and that he had last seen her alive at approximately 7:45 p.m. on 8 November. On the final occasion he had seen Kelly, she had been &quot;quite sober&quot;.

Discussing Kelly&#x27;s background, Barnett related her Irish origins, her marriage at age 16 and subsequent relocation to Cardiff following the death of her husband. Barnett also emphasised his belief Kelly&#x27;s cousin was the source of her leading a life of prostitution, stating: &quot;She was following a bad life with her cousin, who, as I reckon, and as I often told her, was the cause of her downfall.&quot;

Following Barnett&#x27;s testimony, Thomas Bowyer recounted his discovery of Kelly&#x27;s body on 9 November. Bowyer stated he had first observed two pieces of flesh on the bedside table, then seen Kelly&#x27;s extensively mutilated body. He had &quot;at once went very quietly&quot; to John McCarthy to inform him of his discovery. McCarthy had himself looked through the broken windowpane to verify Bowyer&#x27;s discovery before the two had separately proceeded to the nearest police station to report their discovery.

Bowyer&#x27;s testimony was then corroborated by McCarthy, who stated Bowyer had informed him: &quot;Guv&#x27;nor, I knocked at the door, and could not make anyone answer. I looked through the window and saw a lot of blood.&quot; The two had reported their discovery to Inspector Reid at Commercial Street Police Station. McCarthy stated Kelly&#x27;s rent was in arrears by 29 shillings. In discussing her character, McCarthy described Kelly as an &quot;exceptionally quiet woman&quot; when sober, but that &quot;when in drink she had a lot more to say&quot;.

Mary Ann Cox also testified at the inquest. Cox testified she had known Kelly for eight or nine months, and that she had last seen her alive in Dorset Street at 11:45 p.m. on 8 November, &quot;very much intoxicated&quot;. She had been wearing a red pelerine and a shabby skirt. Cox stated she had been in the company of a short, stout and shabbily dressed man who had a pot of ale in his hand. She had not heard any sound from Kelly&#x27;s room when she had returned to her own room at 5 Miller&#x27;s court at 3 a.m. The next witness to testify, Elizabeth Prater, stated she had heard a &quot;suppressed cry&quot; of &quot;Oh! Murder!&quot; at approximately 3:45 a.m., although she stated such cries were commonplace in and around Spitalfields. Also to testify were witnesses Caroline Maxwell and Sarah Lewis. Maxwell testified to having seen Kelly alive on the morning of 9 November; Lewis testified to having seen a stout man in a black wideawake hat standing in the courtyard in the early hours and to hearing a woman cry &quot;Murder!&quot; at &quot;nearly four&quot;.

===Medical testimony===
Shortly after Lewis&#x27;s testimony, Phillips testified as to his examination of the body at 13 Miller&#x27;s Court. He said he arrived at the crime scene at 11:45 a.m., and examined the body at 1:30 p.m. Kelly was lying &quot;two-thirds over, towards the edge of the bedstead&quot; and Phillips was certain the murderer had moved her body to perform the eviscerations. The initial attack had taken place as Kelly had lain on the right side of the bed, and the cause of her death was the severance of her right carotid artery. This conclusion was supported by a large quantity of blood under the bedstead and the palliasse, pillow and sheet at the top of the bed being saturated with blood. Blood spatterings on the wall on the right side of the bed in line with Kelly&#x27;s neck also supported this conclusion.

Phillips estimated Kelly&#x27;s death occurred between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m. Her last meal consisted of fish and potatoes, which had partly passed into her intestines, indicating she had last eaten between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m on 8 November. The superficial cut to her right thumb might have been caused while attempting to defend herself. The blade used for the mutilations was at least six inches (15cm) long and one inch (25mm) wide.

===Police testimony===
Following further eyewitness and character testimony from Julia Venturney and Maria Harvey, Inspectors Beck and Abberline testified about their response and examination of the crime scene. Beck testified to the orders he had given for a police surgeon to attend the scene, his efforts to retrieve evidence, and his orders forbidding any members of the public from entering Miller&#x27;s Court, or for residents to leave until all had been questioned. Abberline testified Superintendent Arnold had ordered the door of Kelly&#x27;s room to be forced open with a pickaxe at 1:30 p.m. He also testified as to his examination of the room, adding his opinion the extensive amount of clothing in the fireplace had been burned by Kelly&#x27;s murderer to provide sufficient light for him to mutilate her body, as the sole source of light in her room had been a single candle placed on top of a broken wine glass.

==Conclusion==
Abberline was the last of 12 witnesses to testify at the inquest, and the hearings were completed in a single day. At the close of the hearings, Macdonald instructed the jury whether they should adjourn to hear further testimony at a later date, or close the procedures. He said: &quot;My own opinion is that it is very unnecessary for two courts to deal with these cases, and go through the same evidence, time after time, which only causes expense and trouble. If the coroner&#x27;s jury can come to a decision as to the cause of death, then that is all that they have to do ... From what I learn, the police are content to take the future conduct of the case. It is for you to say whether you will close the inquiry today; if not, we shall adjourn for a week or fortnight, to hear the evidence that you may desire.&quot;

Following a short deliberation, the jury returned a unanimous verdict: &quot;Wilful murder against some person or persons unknown.&quot;

Kelly&#x27;s death certificate was issued on 17 November. This document records her name as &quot;Marie Jeanette Kelly&quot; and lists her age as &quot;about 25 years&quot;.

==Investigation==
Police conducted extensive house-to-house enquiries and searches. The wife of a local lodging-house deputy, Caroline Maxwell, claimed to have seen Kelly alive at about 8:30 a.m. on the morning of her murder, although she admitted to having only met Kelly on one or two previous occasions; moreover, her description did not match that of those who knew Kelly more closely. Maurice Lewis, a tailor, reported seeing Kelly at about 10 o&#x27;clock that same morning in a pub. Both statements were dismissed by the police since they did not fit the officially estimated time of death; moreover, they could find no other eyewitnesses to confirm these reports. Maxwell may have either mistaken someone else for Kelly or confused the actual day she had seen her.

On 10 November, Bond wrote a report officially linking Kelly&#x27;s murder with four previous ones to occur in and around Whitechapel—those of Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes. Bond also provided an offender profile of the murderer, which suggested the perpetrator was a solitary, eccentric individual who was subject to periodic attacks of homicidal and erotic mania, and who had been in an extreme state of satyriasis as he performed the mutilations upon Kelly and the four previous victims. On the same day, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Charles Warren, issued a pardon for &quot;any accomplice, not being a person who contrived or actually committed the murder, who shall give such information and evidence as shall lead to the discovery and conviction of the person or persons who committed the murder [of Mary Jane Kelly]&quot;. Despite this offer, no-one was ever charged with any of the murders.

No murders with a similar &quot;modus operandi&quot; were committed for over six months, as a result of which the police investigation into the Ripper murders was gradually wound down and press interest declined. Kelly is generally considered to have been the Ripper&#x27;s final victim, and it is assumed that the crimes ended because of the culprit&#x27;s death, imprisonment, institutionalisation, or emigration.

===Joseph Barnett===
The detective in charge of the investigation, Frederick Abberline, questioned Kelly&#x27;s former partner and roommate, Joseph Barnett, for four hours after her murder. His clothes were also examined for bloodstains, but he was released without charge. Abberline&#x27;s investigation appears to have completely exonerated Barnett.

A century after the murder, authors Paul Harrison and Bruce Paley proposed Barnett killed Kelly in a fit of jealous rage, possibly because she had scorned him. Harrison and Paley also suggested that he committed the previous murders to scare Kelly off the streets and away from prostitution. Other authors suggest Barnett killed Kelly only and had extensively mutilated her body to make the crime resemble a Ripper murder. The state of undress of Kelly&#x27;s body, and her folded clothes on a chair, have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which would indicate that she was either killed by someone she knew or believed to be a client.

The door to Kelly&#x27;s property was locked after her murder, indicating the murderer either had possession of the key or knew how to reach through the broken windowpane to lock and unlock the door. However, the perpetrator would likely have observed Kelly reaching through the windowpane to unlock the door prior to inviting him into the room.

Other acquaintances of Kelly&#x27;s put forward as her murderer include her landlord John McCarthy and her former boyfriend Joseph Fleming.

===George Hutchinson===

George Hutchinson only provided his eyewitness information to Sgt Edward Badham on 12 November. Inspector Abberline described Hutchinson&#x27;s statement as important to the investigation. Hutchinson unsuccessfully accompanied police around Whitechapel and Spitalfields in efforts to identify this man. Hutchinson&#x27;s name does not appear again in the existing police records, and so it is not possible to say with certainty whether his evidence was ultimately dismissed, disproven, or corroborated.

In his memoirs, Walter Dew discounts Hutchinson on the basis that his sighting may have been on a different day, and not the morning of the murder. Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who got a good look at the killer was a Jew who had observed a previous victim with her murderer. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.

==Other theories==
A small minority of modern authors consider it possible that Kelly was not a victim of the same killer as the other canonical victims of Jack the Ripper. At an assumed age of 25, Kelly was considerably younger than the other canonical victims, all of whom were in their 40s. In addition, the mutilations inflicted on Kelly were far more extensive than those on other victims. However, Kelly was also the only victim killed in the privacy of a room instead of outdoors. Her murder was separated by five weeks from the previous killings, all of which had occurred within the span of a month.

Writer Mark Daniel proposed that Kelly&#x27;s murderer was a religious maniac, who killed Kelly as part of a ritual sacrifice, and that the fire in the grate was not to provide light but was used to make a burnt offering. In 1939, author William Stewart proposed that Kelly was killed by a deranged midwife, dubbed &quot;Jill the Ripper&quot;, whom Kelly had engaged to perform an abortion. According to Stewart, the murderer had burned her own clothes in the grate because they were bloodstained and had then made her escape wearing Kelly&#x27;s clothes. This, he suggested, was why Caroline Maxwell had claimed to have seen Kelly the morning of her murder, and that Maxwell had actually seen the killer dressed in Kelly&#x27;s clothes. However, the medical reports, which were not available when Stewart constructed his theory, make no mention of pregnancy, and the theory is entirely based on speculation.

In 2005, author Tony Williams claimed that Mary Kelly had been found on the 1881 census return for Brymbo, near Wrexham, Wales. This claim was made on the basis that living next door to the Kelly family was a bachelor named Jonathan Davies, who could have been the &quot;Davies&quot; or &quot;Davis&quot; whom Joseph Barnett claimed had married Kelly when she was approximately 16. This claim is almost certainly wrong because if Kelly&#x27;s husband was indeed killed two or three years later, this Jonathan Davies could not have been him, as the 1891 census return indicates this individual was still alive and residing in Brymbo. In any case, hardly any of the details given by Barnett matched those of the family residing in Brymbo in 1881. Brymbo is in Denbighshire, not Carmarthen or Caernarfon, and the father&#x27;s name was Hubert Kelly, not John. Allegations that the diaries of Sir John Williams, on which Tony Williams based his research and whom he claims was the Ripper, were altered casts further doubt upon this author&#x27;s theories. In 2015, author Wynne Weston-Davies advanced the theory that Kelly&#x27;s real identity was his own great aunt Elizabeth Davies, born in 1857 as the daughter of a Welsh quarryman.

==Funeral==
Mary Jane Kelly was buried at 2 p.m. Monday 19 November 1888. She was laid to rest in St Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cemetery in Leytonstone in a service officiated by the Reverend Father Columban.

No family members could be located to attend her funeral, and both Joseph Barnett and her landlord, John McCarthy, were insistent her remains were interred in accordance with the rituals of her Church. The eight individuals within the two mourning coaches following Kelly&#x27;s polished elm and oak coffin from Shoreditch Church to the cemetery where she was buried were Joseph Barnett, an individual representing John McCarthy, and six women who had known Kelly and who had testified at the inquest into her murder: Mary Ann Cox; Elizabeth Prater; Caroline Maxwell; Sarah Lewis; Julia Venturney; and Maria Harvey. Several thousand people gathered outside Shoreditch Church to observe the funeral procession. Kelly&#x27;s obituary ran as follows:
The inscription upon Kelly&#x27;s grave marker reads: &quot;In loving memory of Marie Jeanette Kelly. None but the lonely hearts can know my sadness. Love lives forever.&quot;

<doc id="1235024" wikidata="Q2900747" url="?curid=1235024" title="Moses Rosen">
<text>Moses Rosen (known in Hebrew as David Moshe Rosen, ) (July 23, 1912 – May 6, 1994) was Chief Rabbi (Rav Kolel) of Romanian Jewry between 1948–1994 and president of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania between 1964 and 1994. He led the community through the entire Communist era in Romania and continued in that role after the restoration of democracy following the Romanian Revolution of 1989. In 1957, he became a deputy in the Romanian parliament (the Great National Assembly), a position he held through the Communist regime, and after 1989, in the democratic parliament. In the 1980s, the Romanian authorities allowed him to receive Israeli nationality and he was elected president of the Council of the Jewish Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv.

==Family and youth==

He was born on July 23, 1912, in the town of Moineşti, in the district of Bacău, the son of a known rabbi, the rav gaon Avraham Arie Leib Rosen (1870–1951), of Galician origin. 
In 1916, his father became rabbi in another Moldavian town, Fălticeni and moved there with the whole family. He used to preach in the &quot;Habad&quot; synagogue and was one of the most esteemed rabbis. Through the mediation of his son-in-law, the rabbi dr Wolf (Zeev) Gottlieb from Glasgow, his responsa and other religious law works of him were edited and printed in Rav Kook Publishing House in Jerusalem (&quot;Shaagat Arié&quot;, &quot;Eitan Arie&quot;, 1912; &quot;Pirkei Shoshana&quot;, 1920).
Moses Rosen lived in Fălticeni for at least part of his childhood. He learned Torah and Talmud with his father for many years, and studied at the local high school. Once, at age 14, after having expressed publicly his opinion against antisemitism, was arrested and judged for false Lèse majesté charges. He was granted amnesty after a month.

After having passed the state maturity exams in Dorohoi, in 1931 the young Moses Rosen entered the Law faculty in the University of Bucharest. But the antisemitic atmosphere, which dominated university life in the Romanian capital at that time, caused him to stop his law studies there and to continue them in Vienna. At the same time, he began his studies at the Viennese Rabbinical Seminary. For economic reasons, he had to return to Romania, and this time, despite hardships, he succeeded in finishing his studies at the Faculty of Law and got his license (Dr. Juris) in 1935. He then began his two-year military service in the town of Fălticeni, most of the time as military rabbi and confessor.
In 1937, he returned to Vienna to resume his Rabbinical studies, where he learned with rabbi Alter Dorf (Gornik) who came from Sadagura. The Anschluss in May 1938 forced him to leave soon after.
He returned to Romania, where he received his ordination in 1939, from some of the greatest rabbis of the country: Haim Rabinovici, Baruh Glanz, Moses Berger, members of the Rabbinical Council of Bucharest and from the chief rabbi of Romania, dr Jacob Itzhak Niemirower and the chief rabbi of Bucovina, dr. Abraham Jacob Mark.

==Activity as young rabbi in Romania==
His first job as rabbi was in a small synagogue in the Mahala quarter of Fălticeni. Then, in May 1940 he was appointed rabbi in the town of Suceava. But, after September 6, 1940, when the Iron Guard or the Legionnaires, the Romanian extreme right, came to the power, Moses Rosen was arrested under the charge of being &quot;Communist&quot; and deported to an internment camp in Caracal, in the south of Romania. After several months, after the defeat of the Legionnaires rebellion by the forces loyal to the prime minister, the General Ion Antonescu, Rosen was discharged and fulfilled a part-time job as rabbi in two synagogues in Bucharest – &quot;Reshit Daat&quot; and &quot;Beit El&quot;. Meanwhile, he also taught Talmud in a Jewish school. The entering of Romania in the war against the Soviet Union, as ally of Nazi Germany, brought more hardships to the Jewish population. Rosen had to hide in order to avoid deportation to Transnistria as a suspected &quot;left wing&quot; or &quot;Bolshevik Jewish activist&quot;. After the coup of August 23, 1944, which brought Romania to abandon the alliance with Hitler and put an end to the Fascist-style antisemitic regime, the freedom for Jews was reestablished and Moses Rosen advanced on the steps of the rabbinical hierarchy in Bucharest. He became the head of the religion department of the Jewish community, was elected as member in the Rabbinate Council and as rabbi of the Great Synagogue of Bucharest (Sinagoga Mare).

==Election as Chief Rabbi of Romanian Jewry – 1948==
In December 1947 the much esteemed Romanian Chief Rabbi in office, Dr Alexandru Şafran, was deported from Romania by the new Communist leadership of the country, which was installed under the pressure of the Soviet occupation force. Rabbi Şafran was considered too close to the Royal family and to the old &quot;bourgeois&quot; leadership of the Romanian Jews (the Union of Romanian Jews, dr Wilhelm Filderman, the Zionist representatives and others) which was hated by the new government. He was ordered to leave Romania within 2–3 hours. 
The Communist party, which meanwhile changed its name to &quot;Romanian Workers Party&quot; (Partidul Muncitoresc Român) imposed on the Jews a new ethnic organization called the Jewish Democratic Committee, somehow an imitation of the former Yevsektsiya from Soviet Russia. Under the supervision of the Jewish Democratic Committee, the rabbis and the communities representatives from all around Romania met in Bucharest on June 16, 1948, and elected by secret vote Dr Moses Rosen as the new Chief Rabbi instead of Alexandru Şafran who was accused as a traitor who &quot;abandoned&quot; his &quot;sheep and goats&quot;.

The rival of Moses Rosen in this election was Dr David Şafran, a nephew of the former chief rabbi, known as fervent Zionist activist. Following the item written on the scrap of paper he had pulled out, David Şafran had to give a sample of sermon about the fight for peace on basis of a week pericope from the Torah. At his turn, following the same procedure, Moses Rosen was demanded to preach at the inauguration of a craftsmen cooperative on basis of other pericope. 
On June 20, 1948, Moses Rosen, as winner of the contest, was installed as &quot;Rav Kolel&quot; in Romania, at a ceremony in the Choral Temple, in the presence of many officials, among them the vice-president of the Great National Assembly (the Romanian parliament under the communist regime), Ştefan Voitec and the minister of religious affairs, Stanciu Stoian. Rabbi David Şafran became a victim of the Communist terror, persecuted and imprisoned for several years for his Zionist convictions.
After his liberation, he was allowed in the end to emigrate to Israel, where he wrote many books, in many of them giving a very negative opinion about Moses Rosen, the &quot;Red rabbi&quot; (&quot;Rabinul roşu&quot;).

==Leader of Judaism in Romania in the years of Stalinism==
As leader of the Jewish religious institutions, Rabbi Rosen was submitted to the control of the Communist authorities which in the 1950s ran a very harsh policy against expressions of Jewish national feeling, especially Zionism, Hebrew culture and Jewish religion. There was some tolerance, but mostly limited to the culture in the Yiddish language. 
Openly opposing the regime, which used Stalinist terror methods, would have attracted cruel individual and collective repression and revenge measures.

After having been allowed during June 27 – July 6, 1948, to take part in the meeting of the World Jewish Congress in Montreux, Switzerland, following Moscow&#x27;s directives, the Romanian communist regime disconnected totally the Jews of Romania from the other Jewish communities in the world for a period of eight years. In those difficult circumstances the diplomatic mission in Bucharest of the newly founded Jewish state of Israel remained active. 
In 1948, the Rabbinical Council of Romanian Jews led by Moses Rosen was coerced to sign a declaration of condemnation of the so-called &quot;Zionist activity&quot; of the former Chief Rabbi Dr. Alexandru Şafran, who was meanwhile elected Chief Rabbi of Geneva.
Nevertheless, despite his formal membership in the Jewish Democratic Committee, Moses Rosen tried to keep a distance from the policy of the leaders of the Committee (Bercu Feldman, H. Leibovici-Şerban, Israel Bacalu etc.) who desired to encourage a Jewish secular culture in Yiddish on account of the Hebrew religious and secular one, to satisfy the ideology of the Communist regime.
The reserved attitude of Moses Rosen vis-a-vis the political and cultural line of the Jewish Democratic Committee proved to be the right diplomacy.
In March 1953, the regime, again inspired by Moscow, decided to rid itself from the Committee and led to its &quot;voluntary&quot; dissolution. The press organ of the Committee, &quot;Unirea&quot; was closed.

After Stalin&#x27;s death and later, after the beginning of de-Stalinization in USSR, the Communist authorities in Romania decided to use the good offices of the leaderships of the different religious faiths in Romania, including those of religious minorities, in order to improve their image in the world and to improve Romania&#x27;s economic relations with other countries.

In 1956, the year when many of the Zionist activists were freed from the Romanian prisons, the authorities allowed Rabbi Rosen to take part again in Jewish meetings and conferences abroad. The first occasion was the contact with the Chief Rabbi of Sweden, Kurt Wilhelm. The same year, in October 1956, Rosen was authorized to found &quot;Revista Cultului Mozaic&quot; (The Mosaic Cult Review), official press organ of the Romanian Jewry, published in Romanian, Yiddish and Hebrew. It was the sole Hebrew periodical regularly printed in the entire communist world, for over 30 years. The prestigious scholar Ezra Fleischer former Romanian Prisoner of Zion, and Israel Prize winner, was one of the first editors of the journal, before his emigration to Israel.

Since 1957, Chief Rabbi Rosen, following a renewed tradition existing during the pre-Fascist epoch, was elected member of the Romanian Parliament, representing a Bucharest constituency (then still with a rather large Jewish population).

==Activity and leadership in the years 1960s–1980s==
In 1964 the Chief Rabbi Moses Rosen added to his functions that of the chairman of the Federation of the Jewish Communities of Romania and kept it until his death.

The position of Rabbi Rosen got strengthened following the change in the Romanian foreign policy after 1964. The regime of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej in his last days and then the new Romanian Communist leaders, Nicolae Ceaușescu and Ion Gheorghe Maurer were interested in increasing the independence of their country from Soviet Union, and to develop good relations with the West.

After the big waves of Jewish emigration permitted by the Communist Party in the years 1947–1952 and again in the first years of the 1960s, approximately 40,000 Jews have remained in Romania (in 1956 they were 146,000 as per the official census).
The Ceauşescu regime decided to strengthen Romania&#x27;s relations with Israel and with the Jewish communities of the world, especially the United States in order to benefit economically and politically. In fact, even earlier, since the 1950s Israel and western Jewish organizations were ready to help economically the Romanian state for the opening of the emigration gates. This time, during the 1970s and 1980s, they were also allowed to help the local Jewish communal life. With the authorization of the regime and with the help (after 1967) of the Joint Distribution Committee an entire network of institution was founded, such as old-age homes, kosher canteens, medical and social assistance to ill and needy. A Jewish cultural life also flourished, with summer camps for the Jewish youth, Talmud Torah and Hebrew language courses, series of concerts and lectures on Jewish themes.

In 1979 he founded, again with the permission of the Romanian regime, the Museum of the history of the Romanian Jews, in the building of &quot;Unirea Sfântă&quot; Jewish Temple in Bucharest.

The activity of Rabbi Rosen in those years, with the silent approval of the regime, from encouraging the emigration to Israel, to the study of the Hebrew language and Jewish traditions and values, to managing the social work network for the Jewish population, won esteem among the Jewish leaders in the world, who praised him for his leadership and diplomatic abilities.

On one occasion, the chief rabbi of England, Sir Immanuel Jakobowitz expressed his enthusiastic admiration for Rosen&#x27;s achievements.
Rabbi Rosen, who always felt like a proud Jew, while still being well acquainted with Romanian culture, became one of Romania&#x27;s non-official &quot;ambassadors&quot; on the international scene. (As did other minority religious leaders, for example the Muslim mufti of the Romanian Turks and Tatars, Yakub Mehmet who became one of his country&#x27;s speakers during his visits in Arab and Muslim countries)

In the 1970s he participated in the efforts of the Bucharest regime to obtain the status of Most favoured nation for Romania&#x27;s trade relations with the USA.

In March 1979, Rabbi Rosen and Patriarch Justinian, head of the Romanian Orthodox Church, jointly sponsored a Jewish and Orthodox Christian Dialogue in Lucerne, Switzerland.
In the same spirit, he maintained very good relations with the Armenian bishop of Bucharest, who later became the Patriarch Catholicos of Armenia, Vazgen I.
A public square in Jerusalem is named after Rabbi Rosen and his wife Amalia.

== Criticism of his relationship with Communist authorities ==
According to Elvira Groezinger, in the Stalinist era, Rabbi Rosen&#x27;s articles in the Yiddish-language weekly &quot;IKUF-Bleter&quot; showed him to be &quot;one of the staunchest leaders of the anti-Zionist and anti-Israel campaigns, and one who praised the Romanian Communist leaders.&quot;

&quot;Hadassah&quot; magazine wrote in 2000 of the &quot;alliance&quot; between Rosen and Nicolae Ceauşescu, &quot;From Rosen&#x27;s viewpoint, anything he could do to help Romania&#x27;s Jews was legitimate. So he became as close to Ceauşescu as he could-in the name of preserving Jewish life in Romania and keeping the exit doors open. After the Six-Day War Romania did not break diplomatic relations with Israel. In return Rosen praised Ceauşescu in the West, undoubtedly contributing to the Romanian chief&#x27;s reputation as a benign Communist leader. What didn&#x27;t become clear until later was that he [Ceauşescu] was extorting a princely sum for his leniency toward the Jews.&quot;

In this connection Rabbi Rosen, in his short 1987 piece &quot;The Recipe&quot;, quoted Charles de Gaulle: &quot;I have no enemies, I have no friends, I have interests,&quot; and added &quot;I succeeded in convincing the Romanian Government that, by doing good to the Jews, by meting out justice to them, it could obtain advantages in matters of favourable public opinion, trade relations, political sympathies... The &#x27;business transaction&#x27; was profitable to both sides.&quot; Millions of Jews, he wrote, were living &quot;in Eastern Europe, in a socialist society. No matter if one likes this or not, it represents a reality... Can they, somehow remain Jewish? The answer given by the past 40 years of the life led by a Jewish community in socialist Romania is categorical and irrefutable. &quot;Yes&quot;, indeed. &quot;They can.&quot; &quot;Our &#x27;balance-sheet&#x27; proves that, without making any noise, demonstrations or rows, we have succeeded in making Romania&#x27;s interests correspond to ours...&quot; He also wrote proudly of the fact the Jews who had left Romania had overwhelmingly made aliyah to Israel: &quot;More than 90 per cent of the Romanian Jews reached Lod. They did not &#x27;lose their way&#x27; heading for other continents...&quot;

In the 1980s in his opposition to antisemitism and xenophobic trends which were sometimes encouraged by Ceauşescu himself, Rabbi Rosen dared to raise his voice even against some protégés of the regime, like the poet Corneliu Vadim Tudor, the writer Eugen Barbu and the literary historian 
Dumitru Vatamaniuc who edited posthumously, and without adequate critic notes, some controversial articles of the Romanian national great poet, Mihai Eminescu which were not favorable towards Jewish people.

==After the 1989 Revolution==

After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Rabbi Rosen was a harsh critic of the efforts to rehabilitate the image of Ion Antonescu, Romania&#x27;s leader during the period when it had been allied with the Axis Powers during World War II, and continued to advocate emigration to Israel: &quot;Demagogy is very strong here... Neofascist propaganda... plays on xenophobia. Jews are a very easy scapegoat... I advise every Jew who can do so, to go to Israel.&quot;

In 1992, he became an honorary member of the Romanian Academy.

Rabbi Rosen was married since 1949 to Amalia, born Ruckenstein, from Burdujeni-Suceava. The couple had no children.

His elder half-brother (from the first marriage of his father) Eliyahu Rosen, was rabbi of the Jews in the Polish town of Oświęcim (Auschwitz) and perished in the Holocaust with his family and whole community. Moses Rosen&#x27;s sister, Betty Bracha Rosen married the future chief rabbi of Scotland, the scholar Zeev Wolf Gottlieb.

<doc id="1235030" wikidata="Q412303" url="?curid=1235030" title="Metaldehyde">
<text>Metaldehyde is an organic compound with the formula (). It is used as a pesticide against slugs and snails. It is the cyclic tetramer of acetaldehyde.

==Production and properties==
Metaldehyde is flammable, toxic if ingested in large quantities, and irritating to the skin and eyes.  It has a white crystalline appearance with a menthol odor.

Metaldehyde is obtained in moderate yields by treatment of acetaldehyde with chilled mineral acids. The liquid trimer, paraldehyde is also obtained. The reaction is reversible; upon heating to about 80 °C, metaldehyde and paraldehyde revert to acetaldehyde.
Metaldehyde exists as a mixture of four stereoisomers, molecules that differ with respect to the relative orientation of the methyl groups on the 8-membered ring. The stereoisomers have respectively the molecular symmetries C (with symmetry of order 2), C (order 4), D (order 8), and C (order 8). All have at least one plane of reflexion, so none of them is chiral. 
==Uses==

===As a pesticide===

It is sold under various trade names as a molluscicide, including Antimilice, Ariotox, Blitzem (in Australia), Cekumeta, Deadline, Defender (in Australia), Halizan, Limacide, Limatox, Limeol, Meta, Metason, Mifaslug, Namekil, Slug Fest, and Slugit. Typically it is applied in pellet form, but it is also found as a liquid spray, granules, paste, or dust.  Often the pesticide includes bran or molasses to attract pests, making it attractive to household pets as well.

Metaldehyde is effective on pests by contact or ingestion and works by limiting the production of mucus in mollusks making them susceptible to dehydration.

Metaldehyde products were used to control the invasive African land snail population in Miami-Dade County in Florida.  Experimental use permits from the U.S. Environmental Protect Agency authorized the application amount and usage in residential areas.

Due to the contamination of drinking water by metaldehyde&#x27;s use in agriculture, a specialist organisation was established in 2008 called &quot;The Metaldehyde Stewardship Group (MSG)&quot;.

On 19 December 2018, the British government banned the use of metaldehyde slug pellets outdoors from spring 2020; after this date it would only be legal to use it in permanent greenhouses. In July 2019, the ban was overturned after the High Court in London agreed with a challenge to its legality. Metaldehyde pellets returned to the UK market until 18 September 2020, when the British government banned the use of metaldehyde slug pellets outdoors after 31 March 2022.

===Other uses===
Metaldehyde was originally developed as a solid fuel. It is still used as a camping fuel, also for military purposes, or solid fuel in lamps. It may be purchased in a tablet form to be used in small stoves, and for preheating of Primus type stoves. It is sold under the trade name of &quot;META&quot; by Lonza Group of Switzerland; it can be included in the field ration of some nations.

==Safety and toxicity to pets and humans==
Metaldehyde has a toxicity profile identical to that for acetaldehyde, being mildly toxic and a respiratory irritant at the 50 ppm level. In terms of water safety, during periods of rainfall metaldehyde pellets become agitated and can seep into natural water courses. The European Commission restricts metaldehyde levels to 0.1 μg/L in drinking water.

Metaldehyde-containing slug baits are banned in some countries as they are toxic to dogs and cats and disturb the natural ecosystems. There is no antidote or specific treatment plan for metaldehyde poisoning. Symptoms of poisoning in dogs and cats vary and are very similar to poisonings by other substances, however they can include tremors, drooling, hyperthermia, vomiting, and restlessness.  If left untreated, symptoms will proceed to seizures and death within days.  Severity of symptoms and speed of onset depend on the quantity ingested and the other contents of the stomach which affect absorption.

A diagnosis can be made by an analysis of stomach contents, which tend to have an apple cider vinegar odor, as well as a history of exposure to the chemical.  Treatment includes IV fluids, sedation, lowering body temperature, and purging of stomach contents with charcoal.  Prompt and aggressive medical attention after a poisoning may make a full recovery possible within 2–3 days.

Due to this toxicity, pet owners may want to investigate alternatives which are not as toxic to pets, such as ferric sodium EDTA or aluminium sulfate. The metaldehyde tablets resemble candies and do not taste bad, making accidental ingestion possible by children or even by adults unaware of their true nature. Their use was popular during the interwar period and several cases of poisoning resulted. Baits may contain a bitterant to prevent accidental consumption by pets or children.

Oral ingestions of metaldehyde have been described in adults attempting suicide; amongst them, the majority experienced gastrointestinal or neurological symptoms. When compared to humans with accidental ingestion of metaldehyde, those attempting suicide tend to be symptomatic (for example reduced concentrations of GABA causing seizures Metaldehyde) and often require care in an intensive care unit and/or long-term hospitalization.

<text>English Racing Automobiles (ERA) was a British racing car manufacturer active from 1933 to 1954.

==Prewar history==

ERA was founded by Humphrey Cook, Raymond Mays, and Peter Berthon in November 1933 and established in Bourne, Lincolnshire, next to Eastgate House, the family home of Raymond Mays between Eastgate road and Spalding road. Their ambition was to manufacture and campaign a team of single seater racing cars capable of upholding British prestige in Continental European racing.

With the cost of full Grand Prix racing prohibitive, they instead aimed ERA&#x27;s efforts at the smaller voiturette—1500cc supercharged—class of motor racing, the Formula 2 equivalent of the day. Humphrey Cook financed the operation—using the wealth from the family drapery business, Cook, Son &amp; Co., of St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, London. Berthon was responsible for the overall design of the cars, while Mays became its principal driver—having already successfully raced several other makes including Vauxhall, Bugatti and Riley.
A new chassis was conceived by British designer Reid Railton (who had also successfully designed the Bluebird land speed record cars for Malcolm Campbell) and was constructed by Thomson &amp; Taylor at Brooklands. The engine was based on the well-proven Riley six-cylinder unit, albeit this was modified in a number of significant ways. A stronger forged crankshaft with a large centre Hyatt roller bearing was made and an entirely new aluminium cylinder head designed. The engine was supercharged using a bespoke supercharger designed by Murray Jamieson who had worked with Mays and Berthon on the &quot;White Riley&quot;. The ERA engine was designed around three capacities— a base 1488cc for the 1500cc racing class, one of 1088cc for the 1100cc class and also was capable of being expanded up to 1980cc for the 2000cc class. It ran on methanol and in its 1500cc form was capable of producing around 180–200 bhp and in excess of 250–275 bhp in 2000cc form.

The panel-beating brothers George and Jack Gray hand-fashioned the new car’s single-seater bodywork, to a design credited to a Mr Piercy who had previously designed the bodywork for Campbell’s &#x27;‘Bluebird’&#x27; record breaker.

===A-Type===
The unveiling of the first ERA—chassis R1A—to the press and public took place at Brooklands on 22 May 1934 following testing at Syston Park. After initial chassis handling problems, which required a number of modifications, soon ERA had a winning formula. By the end of the year ERAs had scored notable victories against many more established marques. In 1935, in a major race at the Nürburgring, ERAs took first, third, fourth and fifth places. The car was available in engine sizes running from 1.1 to 2.0 Litres. Four were built, two with 1.1-litre supercharged engines, one 1.5- and one 2-litre.

Through the remainder of the decade, with drivers of the calibre of Dick Seaman in the team, ERA dominated voiturette racing. 

===B-Type===
In 1935, production of the B-Type began (minimally changed). The A and B models were offered with three engine sizes. 

Two Siamese princes, Chula Chakrabongse and Bira Birabongse, whose trio of ERAs became famous as &quot;Hanuman&quot;, &quot;Romulus&quot; and &quot;Remus&quot;, ran their own team, operating from The White Mouse Garage, Hammersmith. Prince Chula owned the team, having bought Romulus as a present for his cousin, Prince Bira, who was the team&#x27;s driver.

13 B-Type ERAs were produced, three of which were later modified to subsequent (type C or in one case type D) specifications.

===C-Type===

1936 saw the emergence of the C-Type. The same ladder-frame chassis and aluminum panel bodywork were kept on from the A and B models. However, the C model had a slightly different range of engines. None of the C stage cars had the smallest engine option, having instead 1.5 or 2.0 liter, with an added 1.75 liter intermediate engine option. Changes were also made in the suspension and control arms. Hydraulic dampers were installed on the rear suspension while a completely new front suspension appeared, replacing the elliptic leaf springs and friction dampers with a trailing arm with transverse torsion bars and hydraulic dampers. Three type B ERAs were modified to type C standard, cars R4B, R8B, and R12B.

===D-Type===
The D-Type was the designation for the number R4B ERA after modification in 1937. R4B had previously become R4C before being modified to this standard.

===E-Type===

The more modern E-Type ERA appeared just before the Second World War but was not fully developed, with only one car, GP1, actually racing.

==Postwar history==
The Second World War brought a halt to motor racing in Europe, and the team&#x27;s Bourne site was sold to the Bus operator Delaine who occupied adjacent premises. The original building is still in use today by Delaine as an office block. By the time racing resumed in the late 1940s Berthon and Mays had moved on to the British Racing Motors (BRM) project.

===E-Type===

ERA restarted operations in Dunstable under new ownership in 1947 when Leslie Johnson bought the company, together with ERA E-Type GP2, the second of two built in 1939, which had been raced by Reg Parnell and Leslie Brooke. Refitted with a Zoller supercharger and driven by Johnson, GP2 tied with Parnell&#x27;s Maserati 4CLT for fastest lap in the 1948 British Empire Trophy and finished fifth. In the same race GP1, upgraded by the works with Murray Jamieson-designed Roots-type supercharging and driven by Reg Parnell&#x27;s mechanic Wilkie Wilkinson (who had supervised modification of the E-Types), retired with a broken connecting rod.

After posting the fastest time in the opening practice session for the 1948 British Grand Prix, Johnson retired GP2 from third place on the first lap when a driveshaft universal joint failed. In practice for the Coupe du Salon at Montlhéry he broke the lap record but retired GP2 from the race with a fractured fuel tank after three laps.

In 1949 at Goodwood GP2 broke a back axle universal joint in practice but Johnson took the car to fifth in the Richmond Trophy and third in the Chichester Cup. In the first day&#x27;s practice for the Jersey International Road Race, he was second-fastest to Luigi Villoresi&#x27;s record-breaking lap in a Maserati but on the second day the engine bearings failed and the car did not race. At Silverstone&#x27;s 1950 Grand Prix d&#x27;Europe the supercharger disintegrated after two laps.

Meanwhile, GP1, driven by Fred Ashmore, failed to finish the 1948 Jersey International Road Race owing to fuel starvation and defective steering.

In the 1949 BRDC/&quot;Daily Express&quot; International Trophy, Peter Walker took GP1 to within 1.2 seconds of Giuseppe Farina&#x27;s Maserati in practice and finished fifth in the race, despite gearbox and steering problems, a leaking radiator, and the exhaust burning the driver&#x27;s foot. Walker was fastest in practice for Ireland&#x27;s Wakefield Trophy road race, but a snatching brake forced him down the escape road at the first corner. Here GP1&#x27;s race ended when it was hit by an Alta that had already collided with Salvadori&#x27;s Maserati 4CL.

Finally in 1950, GP1 was gutted by fire in a crash at the British Empire Trophy race on the Isle of Man, caused by driveshaft failure when the car was at high speed with Walker at the wheel.

===G-Type===
The 2-litre G-Type raced in the 1952 World Championship, the first season to be run under Formula Two rules. The fundamental design was laid down by Robert Eberan-Eberhorst, one of the world&#x27;s leading theorists of racing car design, who had replaced Ferdinand Porsche at Auto Union and designed the Auto Union Type D Grand Prix car. His protégé and successor David Hodkin completed the G-Type design. The frame was constructed of two longitudinal magnesium tubes with four crossmembers. Suspension was by double wishbone with coil springs at the front and de Dion tube at the rear. The car was powered by a Bristol engine with modifications to Hodkin&#x27;s specifications.

Stirling Moss drove, but the engine was unreliable and the race results were disappointing. Moss said: &quot;It was, above all, a project which made an awful lot of fuss about doing very little. By this time I was very disillusioned by the Clever Professor approach to racing car design. I would eventually learn that even the most brilliant concept could fail if the team concerned lacks the manpower and organization and money to develop the inevitable bugs out of it.&quot;

Johnson sold the project to Bristol—who used the car as the basis for an assault on Le Mans that would bring them several class wins in the mid-1950s—and focused the company on research and development (R&amp;D) engineering. He eventually sold it to Zenith Carburettor Ltd, which was then purchased by Solex, another carburettor firm.

===Chassis design for the Jowett Jupiter===
In 1949 von Eberhorst, working for ERA, designed the space-frame chassis for the Jowett Jupiter.

===Legacy===
Although renamed &quot;Engineering Research and Application Ltd&quot;, and still primarily an R&amp;D operation, ERA still did a small amount of race preparation. In the 1980s it put its name to the ERA Mini Turbo, a turbocharged version of the Mini.

==Today==

===ERAs in competition===

The vast majority of prewar ERAs are still in existence, and they have continuous and verifiable provenance. They still compete in historic events despite the youngest being nearly seventy years old. The cars are particularly associated with the Shelsley Walsh hillclimb thanks in large part to Mays, who won the first two British Hill Climb Championships in 1947 and 1948; indeed an ERA has for many years held the hill record for a prewar car.

===Mays exhibition===
There is a permanent exhibition about Raymond Mays&#x27; contribution to motor racing, including his ERA days, at Bourne Civic Society&#x27;s heritage centre in Bourne. It is open on weekend and bank holiday afternoons.

===ERA trademark===
The ERA trademark is currently owned by Tiger Racing

<text>Sir Leslie Lynn Marr of Sunderland, 2nd Baronet (14 August 1922 – 4 May 2021) was a British landscape artist, painter and racing driver.

==Early life, education and military service==
Marr was born in Durham, England, the son of Lieutenant Colonel and brevet Colonel John Lynn Marr (1877–1931), OBE, TD, of the Royal Garrison Artillery, director of two shipbuilding firms and of the Sunderland Forge and Engineering Company, and Amelia Rachel (1884–1971; known as &quot;May&quot;), daughter of Robert Thompson, of Over Dinsdale Hall, County Durham, a shipbuilder.

He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Pembroke College, Cambridge. In 1932, at the age of ten, due to his father&#x27;s death the previous year he inherited the baronetcy held by his grandfather, shipbuilder Sir James Marr, 1st Baronet, though he did not use the title. He studied engineering at Cambridge University, where he graduated in 1942. During World War II he served as a technician in the Royal Air Force. His interest in painting developed during his posting to Palestine.

==Artistic career==
Marr is recognised primarily as a landscape artist and painter. After the war ended, Marr attended life classes at Heatherley&#x27;s Art School in Pimlico and subsequently studied under David Bomberg at what was then known as the Borough Polytechnic (now London South Bank University). He allocated the upper floor of a bookshop he had rented as an exhibition space for Bomberg&#x27;s students (who became known as the Borough Group). Following the Group&#x27;s dissolution in 1950, Marr continued to paint and to travel across Britain and the continent, and it was at this time that Marr tried his hand at motor racing.

Between 1983 and 1991, Marr lived and painted on Arran, and later moved to a home and studio in Norfolk. Artworks by Marr are held in the public collections of the British Academy, Imperial College Collection, Laing Art Gallery Newcastle upon Tyne, and Pallant House Gallery, Chichester.

==Racing career==
Marr participated in two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, making his debut on 17 July 1954 at the . Racing in his private Connaught, he finished in 13th place, but retired from his last world championship race in 1955, after a damaged brake pipe caused him to spin off. Marr competed in several non-Championship races, with his best results including winning the 1955 Cornwall MRC Formula 1 Race and finishing fourth in the 1956 New Zealand Grand Prix.

==Personal life==
In 1948, Marr married artist Dinora Mendelson (1924–2010), daughter of London art dealer Jacob Mendelson and artist Lilian Holt; Lilian&#x27;s second husband was Marr&#x27;s former teacher David Bomberg. Marr and his wife separated after two years, and were divorced in 1956. In 1962, Marr married Lynn Moynihan; they had two daughters, the elder of whom predeceased him. His third wife was Maureen Monk. Marr died in Gimingham, Norfolk in May 2021 at the age of 98, survived by his widow, daughter, and three grandchildren. He was succeeded as baronet by his first cousin twice removed, Allan James William Marr.

<text>Butjadingen is a peninsula and municipality in the Wesermarsch district, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

==Geography==
Butjadingen is situated on the German North Sea coast. It is bordered on the west and southwest by the Jade River and the east by the Weser River. It forms the northern part of the Wesermarsch district and has a rather low population. The political borough of Butjadingen adjoins Nordenham which geographically is also part of the peninsula Butjadingen.

The peninsula was formed during the Middle Ages when huge floods created today&#x27;s North Sea coastlines. After the Second Marcellus Flood on January 13, 1362 (which occurred around the day of Marcelli Pontificis) Butjadingen temporarily became an island.
Its name is derived from Frisian &quot;Buten&quot; (=outside) and &quot;Jade&quot; and thus means &quot;the lands on the other side of the Jade River&quot;.

In front of the peninsula is the Wadden Sea which stretches between the Jade&#x27;s and the Weser&#x27;s mouths about 23 kilometers to the northwest beyond the Mellum island. It is part of the &quot;Nationalpark Niedersächsisches Wattenmeer&quot; (Lower Saxony Wadden Sea National Park), one of three German Wadden Sea National Parks.

==Economy==
Agriculture and tourism constitute the bulk of its economic activity. The main tourist sites are the villages of Tossens, Burhave, and Eckwarden. There are ferries across the Weser from Nordenham to Bremerhaven and (during summer months) across the Jade from Eckwarderhörne to Wilhelmshaven. In Nordenham there is a train station with several connections per day to Bremen.

<doc id="1235043" wikidata="Q202312" url="?curid=1235043" title="Stewart Downing">
<text>Stewart Downing (born 22 July 1984) is an English former professional footballer. He played most of his career as a winger. As of 2024 he is the assistant coach for Leeds United Under 21s.

Downing started his career at Middlesbrough, where after a loan at Sunderland, he became a key part of the team, winning the League Cup in 2004 and helping them to the UEFA Cup final two years later. In 2009, after Boro&#x27;s relegation, he joined Aston Villa for an initial £10 million, then moved on to Liverpool for twice that amount two years later, again winning the League Cup in 2012. He played for two seasons at West Ham United before returning to Middlesbrough, where he won promotion to the Premier League. In 2019, he was released by Middlesbrough after 404 total appearances, and signed for Blackburn Rovers.

A full international from 2005 to 2014, Downing earned 35 caps for England. He was included in the nation&#x27;s squads that reached the quarter-finals at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. He announced his retirement in August 2021.

==Club career==
===Middlesbrough===
Downing was born in Middlesbrough, Teesside, and was a graduate of the Middlesbrough Academy.

Downing signed his first professional contract on 6 September 2001. His debut came on 24 April 2002 in a Premier League match away to Ipswich Town, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 loss at Portman Road. He was limited to just three appearances during the 2001–02 season, plus a further three in the following 2002–03 season. His first senior goal came on 1 October 2002 in a 4–1 League Cup second round away victory over Brentford, coming on as a substitute to conclude the scoring at Griffin Park.

On 30 October 2003, Downing went on a one-month loan to Sunderland, of the First Division. He scored three goals in seven matches for Mick McCarthy&#x27;s Black Cats team, starting on 4 November when he equalised in a 3–1 win at Gillingham, also assisting John Oster.

Having scored as many goals on his loan as Middlesbrough&#x27;s top scorer Szilárd Németh had recorded all season, Downing was recalled from his loan on 11 December due to injury to Juninho. He was a regular for the remainder of the season, but was an unused substitute on 29 February 2004, when they won the 2004 League Cup Final against Bolton Wanderers.

The 2004–05 season saw Downing make 49 appearances, scoring six goals, as well as providing numerous assists. In a UEFA Cup match against Lazio in November 2004, both Downing and Zenden were in the starting line-up. Though Zenden scored both goals in the 2–0 victory, Downing drew praise for his performance down the left. Such performances that season saw him called up to Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s England squad in February 2005 for a friendly against the Netherlands.

A knee injury saw Downing sidelined for five months at the end of 2005, though he returned to play his part in the run to the 2006 UEFA Cup Final, including three assists in the 4–2 (4–3 agg) victory over Steaua București in the semi-final second leg. He started in the final as Middlesbrough were beaten 4–0 by Sevilla at the Philips Stadion.

On 26 February 2008, Downing signed a new five-year contract, keeping him signed on at Middlesbrough until summer 2013. With the departure of Mark Schwarzer in May 2008, Downing became Middlesbrough&#x27;s second longest serving player after Brad Jones.

The 2008–09 season was a mixed one for Downing. Middlesbrough had their best start to the season in six years which saw them climb to 8th in the table, however, a terrible winless run which started in November 2008 saw them fall into the relegation zone. On 5 January 2009, he handed in a written transfer request expressing his desire to leave the club but the request was turned down on the same day. In the penultimate match of the season, he sustained a foot injury after a challenge from Stiliyan Petrov in a home match against Aston Villa in May 2009, which needed an operation, ruling him out for at least four months. After spending the whole of the second half of the season in the relegation zone, Middlesbrough were relegated on the final day after they lost 2–1 away at West Ham United. Downing, having started every league match, except the last match, ended the season with no league goals, having only scored two against West Ham United in the FA Cup.

===Aston Villa===
Following Middlesbrough&#x27;s relegation, Downing signed a four-year contract with Aston Villa, becoming Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first signing of the 2009 Summer transfer window for a fee of £10 million with an extra £2 million to be paid depending on appearances. On 7 November 2009, O&#x27;Neill announced that Downing had returned to full training following his injury against Villa while playing for Middlesbrough during 2008–09. Downing made his Aston Villa debut on as a 69th-minute substitute for Steve Sidwell in the away match against Burnley. He scored his first goal for Villa in the League Cup fourth round tie against Portsmouth at Fratton Park on 1 December 2009.

Downing&#x27;s return to action saw him returning to his preferred left wing role, with James Milner moving to central midfield for Villa. Downing played in Villa&#x27;s first win at Old Trafford against Manchester United since 1983 on 12 December 2009 in their 1–0 victory over the Red Devils. Downing then went on to score his first and second league goal for Villa in their 5–2 win against Burnley on 2 February 2010. His second season with Aston Villa had been a much improved one, he scored the first Premier League goal of the season against West Ham United at Villa Park on 14 August in a 3–0 win. In the final match of the season, Downing scored his eighth against Liverpool at Villa Park with the result ending 1–0; during the 2010–11 season, Downing made 44 appearances and scored eight goals in all competitions. Downing was the subject of speculation over the summer, with Liverpool showing interest in the winger. On 6 July, Liverpool tabled a bid of £15 million for Downing but this was rejected by Villa, who said they would not let Downing go for less than £20m.
New Villa manager Alex McLeish then stated that Downing was not for sale and he would not be leaving Villa in the summer. However, on 13 July 2011, a fee was agreed between Aston Villa and Liverpool for the transfer of Downing.

===Liverpool===
Downing completed his move to Liverpool on 15 July 2011, for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £20 million. On 13 August 2011, Downing made his debut in Liverpool&#x27;s first match of the 2011–12 Premier League, in a 1–1 draw against Sunderland at Anfield, playing the full 90 minutes. On 20 August 2011, he started and played the full 90 minutes against Arsenal in a 2–0 victory at the Emirates Stadium. On 6 January 2012, Downing scored his first goal for Liverpool against Oldham Athletic at Anfield in the third round of the FA Cup. On 26 February he won the League Cup with Liverpool, scoring his penalty in the shoot-out and winning the Alan Hardaker Trophy as Man of the Match. On 18 March 2012 he scored the winner in a 2–1 victory over Stoke City in the FA Cup quarter-final, securing a second Wembley visit for Liverpool in the semi-finals in what was described as &quot;his most telling Liverpool contribution&quot; so far.

Downing scored the winner in Liverpool&#x27;s first match of 2012–13, a left foot shot in a UEFA Europa League match against Gomel. On 30 August 2012, Downing was deployed as a left back against Hearts. He scored the winning and only goal against Anzhi Makhachkala at Anfield in the Europa League. After the match, he was praised by manager Brendan Rodgers saying &quot;It&#x27;s been a tough time. He&#x27;s had a rough ride but he&#x27;s an important member of our team.&quot; On 22 December, he made his first league assist and scored his first league goal in a 4–0 win against Fulham. He scored his second league goal for the club on 2 March 2013, opening the scoring in a 4–0 win away to Wigan Athletic, with a header from a Philippe Coutinho cross. In Liverpool&#x27;s next match, Downing scored the equaliser against Tottenham Hotspur, in a 3–2 home victory for Liverpool. This marked Downing&#x27;s fifth goal in all competitions and his last goal for Liverpool.

===West Ham United===
On 13 August 2013, Downing signed a four-year contract with West Ham United for an undisclosed fee which was reported to be in the region of £5m. He made his debut for the club, coming on as a substitute for Matt Jarvis in the 2–0 home win against Cardiff City at Upton Park on the opening day of the 2013–14 season on 17 August 2013.
Downing scored his first goal for West Ham on 3 May 2014 in a 2–0 home win against Tottenham Hotspur.

In the 2014–15 season, Downing scored his first goal of the season against Crystal Palace in a 3–1 away win on 23 August 2014. Downing continued his fine form for West Ham in a diamond formation which saw him being deployed in a central role. On 1 November 2014, Downing scored for West Ham against Stoke City in a 2–2 away draw, with West Ham coming from two goals down to draw 2–2. Downing scored his third goal of the season against Sunderland in a 1–1 draw away from home on 13 December 2014. A week later, he scored against Leicester City, curling a left-footed shot from 20 yards as West Ham won 2–0.

===Return to Middlesbrough===
On 16 July 2015, Downing returned to boyhood club Middlesbrough, signing a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the region of £5.5 million, potentially rising to £7 million if the club were to gain promotion to the Premier League. The first match of his return was on 9 August 2015, a goalless draw away to Preston North End in the first Championship match of the season. On 12 September 2015, he netted the first goal of his second spell, to open a 2–0 win over Milton Keynes Dons at the Riverside. Middlesbrough secured promotion on the final day of the season, after a 1–1 draw with promotion rivals Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at home, gaining automatic promotion as runners-up.

Downing faced competition ahead of the club&#x27;s first season return in the top flight with the signings of Gastón Ramírez, Viktor Fischer and Adama Traoré. In January 2017, Middlesbrough announced that they would allow Downing to leave on loan during that winter transfer window, as Downing had not been a regular starter throughout the league campaign. Despite interest from Crystal Palace, no move materialised and Downing remained at the club. Downing suffered a second relegation with Middlesbrough, when they were relegated down to the Championship.

After relegation, Downing was informed by new manager Garry Monk that he could leave the club. Birmingham City manager Harry Redknapp offered Downing a two-year contract, with Redknapp stating that he is a &quot;keen admirer&quot; of the player. The transfer fell through, though Downing soon regained his place at Middlesbrough after Tony Pulis replaced Monk in December. Downing was one of four players released by Middlesbrough at the end of the 2018–19 season, having totalled 404 appearances in his two spells at the club.

===Blackburn Rovers===
Downing signed for Championship club Blackburn Rovers on 21 June 2019 on a one-year contract. He scored his first goal for Blackburn in an EFL Cup second round tie against Oldham Athletic on 13 August, a 3–2 home win. Despite being an ever-present throughout the 2019–20 season, Downing&#x27;s departure from the club was announced on 24 June 2020 on the expiration of his contract.

Despite his previous exit, Downing signed a new contract with Blackburn that November. He once again left the club at the end of his existing contract, this confirmed days after the 2020–21 season concluded. After his departure was confirmed, Downing stated that he was pondering his future in football, though admitted that he would &quot;probably&quot; retire which he did in August 2021.

==International career==
Downing was first called up as a 19-year-old for the 2003 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. With seven under-21 caps to his name, Downing made his England debut on 9 February 2005 in a home friendly, played at Villa Park against the Netherlands, replacing Shaun Wright-Phillips in the second half.

Downing&#x27;s international career took a setback in May 2005 when he was injured during a training session with England on their tour of the United States, keeping him out of action until 2006. Downing was included in the England World Cup squad in May 2006 by Sven-Göran Eriksson, primarily as a back-up for Joe Cole, and came on as a second-half substitute in England&#x27;s victorious opening match against Paraguay. He was brought on once again in the match against Trinidad and Tobago, when England scored two goals in the last ten minutes.

On 16 August 2006, Downing made his first start for England, as Greece were beaten by 4–0, with Downing involved in three of the goals. He started the subsequent three Euro 2008 qualifiers, against Andorra and Macedonia. Downing hoped to have proven many of his critics wrong after Fabio Capello became the third successive England manager to give him an England cap, on 26 March 2008 in a 1–0 friendly defeat to France. He was also called up (alongside Middlesbrough teammate David Wheater) for Capello&#x27;s friendlies against United States and Trinidad and Tobago, where he received the nod ahead of Ashley Young. His performance justified his selection by contributing with the first two goals and won praise from the press who had previously slated his inclusion in the squad. A few months after Capello took charge of England, the Italian manager stated that he had been most impressed by Downing. He was chosen again by Capello to replace Aaron Lennon for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro on 12 October 2010. During his second season with Aston Villa, Downing began to feature regularly for England under Capello.

After his transfer to Liverpool, he featured in the two qualifying matches at the start of the season, a 3–0 win against Bulgaria, and a 1–0 win against Wales in which he provided the assist for the only goal of the match scored by former Aston Villa teammate Ashley Young. He also came on at half-time to replace Theo Walcott in the 1–0 win against Spain and started the following match against Sweden which England also won 1–0. On 16 May 2012, new England manager Roy Hodgson named Downing in his 23-man squad for the upcoming UEFA Euro 2012 tournament. He started in a 1–0 win away to Norway on 26 May, which was Hodgson&#x27;s first match in charge of England. Downing did not make an appearance during UEFA Euro 2012. Having not appeared in a squad since 2012, in November 2014 Downing was called into the squad for England&#x27;s matches against Slovenia and Scotland.

==Personal life==
Downing has been involved in several charitable and community projects outside his playing career. He supports the nationwide No Messin&#x27; campaign, along with freestyler Colin Nell and boxer Amir Khan, warning youngsters against playing on railway lines. Downing held a charity dinner with special guest boxer Ricky Hatton to raise funds for the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne in February 2008. The hospital had cared for Vicky, Stewart&#x27;s sister, who died of leukaemia in 1993 at the age of 4. The honorary position of president of Middlesbrough Futsal Club was bestowed on Downing in December 2007. During his spare time Downing has DJ-ed at several nightclubs in Middlesbrough while also playing sets in Ibiza among other places.

Downing&#x27;s former agent Ian Elliott was arrested by Cleveland Police in September 2008 after he was reported to the police by the player himself after he had concerns &quot;regarding the way his and his company&#x27;s affairs [had] been handled&quot;. He told Middlesbrough about his concerns some time earlier and the club advised him to involve lawyers and accountants to investigate, while The Football Association acted as liaison between the police and the club.

<doc id="1235044" wikidata="Q172293" url="?curid=1235044" title="Lloyd Ruby">
<text>Richard Lloyd Ruby (January 12, 1928 – March 23, 2009) was an American racecar driver who raced in the USAC Championship Car series for 20 years, achieving 7 victories and 88 top-ten finishes. He also had success in endurance racing, winning the 24 Hours of Daytona twice, the 1966 12 Hours of Sebring and the 1966 World Sportscar Championship.

==Racing career==
Ruby raced in the USAC Championship Car series in the 1958–1977 seasons, with 177 career starts, including the Indianapolis 500 from 1960 to 1977. He achieved 88 top-ten finishes, and seven victories. His best finish at Indy was third, in 1964. In 1966, he led the Indy 500 for 68 laps.

Ruby also had two endurance racing victories in the 24 Hours of Daytona (1965–1966), both times partnering with Ken Miles. Ruby and Miles teamed up to win the 1966 12 Hours of Sebring and the 1966 World Sportscar Championship. Ruby was scheduled to drive in the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans, however he was forced to withdraw due to spinal injuries suffered in a plane crash. A year later, he teamed with Denny Hulme in a Ford GT 40 Mk IV for the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans. Ruby played a key role in Ford Motor Company&#x27;s GT40 program in the mid-1960s. He also raced in the 1961 United States Grand Prix.

===Indianapolis 500===

Despite a Championship Car career replete with success, Ruby is probably best remembered for his many misfortunes at the Indianapolis 500. His biography, written by Ted Buss in 2000, was titled, &quot;Lloyd Ruby: The Greatest Driver Never to Win the Indy 500&quot;. Ruby led the race in five different years, for a total of 126 laps, however, his best finish at Indianapolis was third, in 1964. His only other top-five finish at Indy came in 1968. In 1991, he was inducted into the Auto Racing Hall of Fame.

Perhaps Ruby&#x27;s most notorious hard-luck bout at Indy came in 1969. With race leader Mario Andretti experiencing overheating problems, Ruby was in a strong position to score a victory. During a pit stop around the halfway point, a crew member motioned Ruby to pull away too soon. The refueling nozzle was still engaged in the car&#x27;s left saddle tank, and as Ruby dropped the clutch, the car lurched forward. The nozzle ruptured a hole in the gas tank, ending Ruby&#x27;s day.

==Death==
He died in 2009 at the age of 81 in his hometown of Wichita Falls, Texas.

==Legacy and halls of fame==
Ruby&#x27;s racing career was honored with the Bruton Smith Legends Award at the Texas Motor Sports Hall of Fame in Fort Worth in 2005. He was inducted into the National Midget Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 2008.

<doc id="1235049" wikidata="Q171429" url="?curid=1235049" title="Luciano Burti">
<text>Luciano Pucci Burti (born 5 March 1975) is a Brazilian former racing driver who raced in Formula One in 2000 and 2001. He was later a commentator for TV Globo.

==Early career==
Burti&#x27;s early career saw him graduate through the usual channels and he found himself in British Formula 3 driving for the crack Stewart Racing team. In his second season of F3 in 1999 he finished runner-up to Marc Hynes, but it was third-placed Jenson Button who would go on to achieve stardom in Formula One. Burti impressed when testing the Stewart F1 car that season and became Jaguar&#x27;s tester for 2000, mainly down to the lobbying of Jackie Stewart, the outgoing team-boss.

==Formula One career==
===2000–2001===
A surprise Grand Prix début came on 16 July 2000 at the Austrian Grand Prix, when he was called up at short notice as a replacement for the ill Eddie Irvine. Having tested consistently well for Jaguar in the 2000 Formula One season and with a race start already under his belt, he was promoted to the race team alongside Irvine in 2001, replacing the retiring Johnny Herbert. However, he fell out of favour after just four races, and was replaced by ex-Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa.

Burti found a seat immediately at Prost, where the underperforming Gastón Mazzacane had been sacked. Burti raced competently for Prost and recorded his highest finish - eighth place - at the Canadian Grand Prix; he also occasionally qualified ahead of his highly experienced teammate Jean Alesi. However, his most notable moment in the first half of the season was an accident at the German Grand Prix - unable to avoid the slowing Ferrari of Michael Schumacher, whose gearbox had failed seconds after the race start, Burti struck the back of Schumacher&#x27;s car, launching his Prost into a destructive cartwheel over the Arrows of Enrique Bernoldi. None of the three drivers were injured and all took the restarted race, from which Burti spun out on the 23rd lap.

====Crash at 2001 Belgian Grand Prix====
Two races later he had a more serious crash at the Belgian Grand Prix when his car touched with Eddie Irvine as he attempted to overtake the Northern Irishman. The front wing became lodged under Burti&#x27;s front wheels, leaving him unable to brake or steer into the 190 mph Blanchimont corner; the impact with the tire barrier was so great that segments of the barrier were thrown into the air, landing on Burti&#x27;s cockpit and knocking him unconscious. Irvine, after suffering a sizeable impact himself, subsequently helped the marshals in their attempt to extract Burti from his car. The crash forced him to sit out the rest of the season with facial bruising and a concussion. His seat was taken by Czech rookie Tomáš Enge.

===2002–2004===
Burti subsequently signed to test for the Ferrari team, but that came to an end at the end of his contract in 2004. Over the course of his Formula One career, he scored no championship points. He has since returned to Brazil, where he competes in Stock Car Brasil and commentates on Formula One races for TV Globo.

<doc id="1235054" wikidata="Q1756407" url="?curid=1235054" title="Across 110th Street">
<text>Across 110th Street is a 1972 American neo noir action thriller film directed by Barry Shear and starring Yaphet Kotto, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Franciosa and Paul Benjamin. The film is set in Harlem, New York and takes its name from 110th Street, the traditional dividing line between Harlem and Central Park that functioned as an informal boundary of race and class in 1970s New York City.

Focusing on a heist, murder and a subsequent investigation, &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; takes inspiration from both the blaxploitation films of the 1970s as well as the film noir genre. &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; is remembered in part for its soundtrack, which features a classic song of the same name by Bobby Womack.

==Plot==
Jim Harris accompanies his partners to steal $300,000 from a Mafia-controlled policy bank in Harlem, disguising themselves as police officers. The robbery goes awry, leading to the deaths of seven men — three black gangsters, two Mafia members, and two police officers. Lieutenant William Pope, a straitlaced black police officer, is assigned to work on the case with Captain Frank Mattelli, a streetwise but aging Italian-American cop.

Despite Lieutenant Pope&#x27;s commitment to working strictly by the book and asserting that he is in charge of the investigation, he struggles to restrain Mattelli. Mattelli, who receives money from Doc Johnson, the leader of black organized crime in Harlem, poses a challenge to Pope&#x27;s authority. Over approximately twenty-four hours, Pope and Mattelli race against time to apprehend the criminals before they become targets of the Mafia, which is also on the hunt for Harris&#x27; crew. The Italians, led by Nick DiSalvio, a brutal capo, plan to torture the robbers as a deterrent to others attempting a similar heist.

==Cast==
== Production ==
Anthony Quinn, who also served as executive producer, originally wanted John Wayne and then Kirk Douglas for the lead role of Captain Mattelli. Both passed, as did Burt Lancaster, leaving Quinn to take the part. Additionally, he hoped to get Sidney Poitier to play Lt. Pope. Upon hearing the news, Harlem residents disagreed with the choice, claiming Poitier was too Hollywood and not urban enough for the role. Quinn relented, and Yaphet Kotto was chosen to play Pope.

When planning the film, director Barry Shear was adamant that only by filming in real locations could he bring a suitably raw and genuine feel to its themes of gang warfare and bloody street violence. Hollywood colleagues warned him that New York was the worst city in which to film, due to labor costs and permit nightmares, and Harlem the worst part of New York, due to its status at that time as the most lawless ghetto in the US. Undeterred, Shear took on Fouad Said, an unrivalled expert in location shooting, as a co-producer.

Said had cut his teeth as a cameraman on the TV series &quot;I Spy&quot;, which broke new ground for American television by mixing studio work with location footage shot all over the world; a feat made possible by abandoning the ubiquitous but unwieldy Mitchell cameras of the day in favor of the lightweight Arriflex 35 IIC. Said found out during principal photography that the first production model of the much-anticipated and groundbreaking Arriflex 35BL camera had just arrived in New York. Having established a long and successful relationship with ARRI over the &quot;I Spy&quot; years, Said persuaded Volker Bahnemann, at that time Vice President of the ARRI division in America, to allow his &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; crew one week to try out the 35BL, the first time the camera was used on a motion picture.

The camera immediately revolutionized what they were able to achieve on the streets of Harlem. It was and featured a dual-compartment coaxial magazine positioned at its rear, for perfectly shoulder-balanced handheld shooting. &quot;It&#x27;s a real winner,&quot; affirmed cinematographer Jack Priestley ASC at the time. &quot;It&#x27;s as quiet as a church mouse and has great flexibility, especially as it weighs only 33 lbs. I don&#x27;t know what I would have done in a lot of spots without it, especially in those small rooms where we often had to shoot. You put it on your shoulder and walk around, bend down, sit down, hold it in your lap—everything. I think it&#x27;s going to help the film industry tremendously.&quot;

One week with the 35BL proved it to be such a valuable tool that Said negotiated keeping the camera for the last four weeks of filming. Camera operator Sol Negrin, later to become a respected cinematographer and ASC member, reported of the 35BL: &quot;It was used in major sound sequences shot in confined quarters where it was impossible to use a large camera, but where we needed portability and quietness. We also used it on the rooftops of buildings in Little Italy—buildings that had no elevators. The low noise level of the Arriflex 35BL permits shooting sound sequences in confined quarters, thus eliminating the post-dubbing of dialogue that is usually necessary under such conditions.&quot;

A combination of Fouad Said&#x27;s radical location skills and ARRI&#x27;s groundbreaking technology allowed Shear&#x27;s dream of a realistic backdrop for his story to be accomplished. A staggering 95% of the movie was shot at a total of 60 different interior and exterior locations in Harlem.

== Themes ==

=== Racial tensions ===
The late 1960s and early 1970s were a time when racial tensions ran deep, and often exploded into riots. In the summer of 1964, a riot erupted in Harlem after a white off-duty police officer shot and killed an armed black teenager in Yorkville, Manhattan. The &quot;hot summer&quot; of 1967 saw riots rip through the country, in major cities throughout the West and the North, as black communities responded in anger to poverty and police brutality. In 1968, just three years before the release of &quot;Across 110th Street&quot;, numerous businesses and storefronts in Harlem were set on fire as residents reacted in frustration and grief after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

The 1970s were also a time when feelings of black power were everywhere in African-American communities across the United States. The black power ethos entered even into the underworld of organized crime, as evident in &quot;Across 110th Street&quot;, where black gangsters like Doc Johnson are coming to believe that black people should control the organized crime circuits within their neighborhoods rather than the racist Mafia bosses.

=== New York City in the 1970s ===
&quot;Across 110th&quot; Street portrays New York City of the 1970s, a decade when crime, drug use and poverty was at an all-time high. The city economy was broke, its infrastructure crumbling and pimps and prostitutes filled Times Square. Harlem itself was a place of little opportunity. Middle class residents fled the neighborhood in large numbers, leaving the poor to abandoned buildings and empty storefronts. Burned out buildings were visible on nearly every block of Harlem&#x27;s major avenues, 24% of the area&#x27;s population was living on welfare, and between 1976 and 1978 the population of east and central Harlem fell by almost a third. In 1971, an estimated 60% of Harlem&#x27;s economic activity depended on cash flow from gambling — the illegal &quot;numbers&quot; racket controlled by organized crime.

During a potent scene in the film, Jim Harris explains to his girlfriend why he was forced to turn to robbery to make ends meet. As a middle-aged black man, formerly incarcerated, with a health problem and no formal education or highly-paid skills, Harris&#x27; only options are to work a demeaning, low-paying job with no future or to turn to crime. Even the cop Mattelli justifies the bribes he receives as supplemental income for his meager wages as a police officer.

==Release==
The film earned an estimated $3.4 million in North American rentals in 1973.

* In 1973 it was banned by the South African Publications Control Board.
* In 1984 it was released on VHS by Key Video, one of CBS/Fox&#x27;s home video lines.

== Reception ==
Among contemporary reviews, Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;It manages at once to be unfair to blacks, vicious towards whites and insulting to anyone who feels that race relations might consist of something better than improvised genocide ... By the time it is over virtually everybody has been killed—by various means, but mostly by a machine gun that makes lots of noise and splatters lots of blood and probably serves as the nearest substitute for an identifiable hero.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is not for the squeamish. From the beginning it is a virtual blood bath. Those portions of it which aren&#x27;t bloody violent are filled in by the squalid location sites in New York&#x27;s Harlem or equally unappealing ghetto areas leaving no relief from depression and oppression. There&#x27;s not even a glamorous or romantic type character or angle for audiences to fantasy-empathize with.&quot;

Gene Siskel gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote &quot;The film breaks no new ground, remaining content to combine familiar elements from &#x27;In the Heat of the Night&#x27; (modern black cop vs. traditional white cop) and at least a half-dozen urban melodramas in which Italians and blacks go at each other with guns and mouths blazing.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; slammed the film as &quot;a crime melodrama at once so tacky and so brutal that one feels tempted to swear out a warrant for the arrest of the filmmakers.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;self-destructs by consistently selling out to stomach-churning displays of unrelieved violence... that the grisliness depicted so graphically in &#x27;Across 110th Street&#x27; is true to life is undisputable; it&#x27;s the manner and extent of its depiction on the screen that&#x27;s deplorable.&quot;

In 1973, veteran black Chicago journalist Lu Palmer opened his alternative newspaper &quot;Black X-Press Info Paper&quot; with a review of &quot;Across 110th Street&quot;. He reflected that the film was particularly thoughtful and well-acted compared to many other low-budget blaxploitation pictures of the era and noted that &quot;this flick ought to be carefully studied — again, for its images and messages.&quot;

&quot;Across 110th Street&quot; presently holds a score of 83% at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 18 reviews.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack of &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; reflects the mood and historical context of the film. The songs were written and performed by Bobby Womack, while the score was composed and conducted by J. J. Johnson. Made up of gritty and brooding funk, the soundtrack echoes the dark themes and imagery of the film.

The critically praised title song was a No. 19 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Singles chart in 1973 and was later featured in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1997 blaxploitation homage &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. This song was also featured on the soundtrack for the 2007 film American Gangster, starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. Its lyrics reflect the broader themes of impoverishment and desperation in the film, where characters feel beaten down by poverty and must do whatever it takes to stay alive.

The song appears at the start of the movie during the opening credit sequence, however it&#x27;s not the version on the soundtrack that has been released as a single. Instead, a more intense upbeat and funkier version is used.

<text>Lukas &quot;Luki&quot; Botha (16 January 1930 – 1 October 2006) was a Formula One driver from South Africa, who raced in one World Championship Grand Prix, driving a privately entered Brabham BT11 in the 1967 South African Grand Prix.

Born in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa, Botha was an avid sports car and endurance racer. His first car was a South African built Dart with a 1500cc Ford engine with a Cosworth camshaft. He achieved a second in class finish in his first three-hour race with this car. He graduated to a Lotus 23 with a Cosworth 1100cc later in 1965 with which he won five national class races in 1966. The car was in an accident later in the year as the rear suspension failed on the Jukskei sweep at Kyalami.

In the latter half of 1966, he bought an Elva MK VII and a 1760cc engine from a Porsche RS5 Spider. These two were combined to create an Elva Mk VII-Porsche RS. This proved a formidable combination; his first 2000cc Sports Car Class win came in the car at Bulawayo. Later in a nine-hour endurance race at Kyalami the gearbox failed, but not before setting a fastest lap in his class of 1:34:50 for the old circuit.

During the VIII Grande Premio de Angola, the Elva proved its worth, achieving a fifth overall splitting the pack of Ferrari 250GTs from first to eighth. He achieved a win over the factory Porsches, Ford GT40s and Lolas. Botha later commented that it was his most enjoyable racing experience. He won six Sports Car class races, and two 2000cc 2/3 hour endurance races and only replaced the gearbox once on the car.

His move to Formula One came in the form of a Brabham BT11 with a Climax 2000cc engine. On his first outing with the new car he came second (November 1966). He took part in the South African series races the following year until July. He also competed in that year&#x27;s South African Grand Prix, part of the Formula One World Championship. After 38 laps he had a mechanical problem that was resolved with the help of a spectator and continued to finish the race with 60 laps to his credit. He was not classified at the finish.

During a race at Lourenço Marques, now Maputo, in Mozambique, he crashed heavily as a run-off area was swamped by the crowd. The crash claimed the lives of nine spectators and injured 17. After the crash, he did get back into the seat of a racing car, but felt that the spark was no longer there and stopped.

He continued his work in civil engineering and assisted with some of the civil engineering work in Soweto. Later he continued his love of South Africa by farming in the KZN-Midlands before moving to East London to fill a post as an engineer. A number of years later he moved his family back to his birth town of Pretoria where he later was appointed as CEO of the Tswane Metropolitan Council.

<text>A breed registry, also known as a herdbook, studbook or register, in animal husbandry, the hobby of animal fancy, is an official list of animals within a specific breed whose parents are known. Animals are usually registered by their breeders while they are young. The terms studbook and register are also used to refer to lists of male animals &quot;standing at stud&quot;, that is, those animals actively breeding, as opposed to every known specimen of that breed. Such registries usually issue certificates for each recorded animal, called a pedigree, pedigreed animal documentation, or most commonly, an animal&#x27;s &quot;papers&quot;. Registration papers may consist of a simple certificate or a listing of ancestors in the animal&#x27;s background, sometimes with a chart showing the lineage.

==Types of registries==
There are breed registries and breed clubs for several species of animal, such as dogs, horses, cows and cats. The &quot;European Association of Zoos and Aquaria&quot; (EAZA) and the US &quot;Association of Zoos and Aquariums&quot; (AZA) also maintains stud books for captive species on display ranging from aardvarks to zebras.

Kennel clubs always maintain registries, either directly or through affiliated dog breed clubs. Some multi-breed clubs also maintain registries, as do non-affiliated breed clubs, and there are a few registries that are maintained by other private entities such as insurance agencies; an example of this in the United States is the Field Dog Stud Book. Working dog organizations also maintain registries.

There are also entities that refer to themselves as registries, but that are thinly veiled marketing devices for vendors of puppies and adult dogs, as well as a means of collecting registration fees from novice dog owners unfamiliar with reputable registries and breed clubs. Although these entities generally focus on dogs, particularly in relationship to the puppy mill industry, some are marketed as cat registries. At least one group claims to register wild species (held by private individuals rather than by legitimate zoological parks, which use the AZA).

Horse breeding also has such problematic registries, particularly for certain color breeds. While many color breeds are legitimate, some &quot;registries&quot; are primarily a marketing tool for poor quality animals that are not accepted for registration by more mainstream organizations. Other &quot;registries&quot; are marketing attempts to create new horse breeds, usually by breeders using crossbreeding to create a new type, but the animals are not yet breeding true.

Many such questionable registries are incorporated as for-profit commercial businesses, in contrast to the formal not-for-profit status of most reputable breed clubs. They may provide volume discounts for registrations by commercial dog breeders such as puppy mills. An unscrupulous registry for dogs or horses is often spotted by a policy to not require any proof of pedigree at all. In the dog world, such registries may not sponsor competitions and thus cannot award championship points to identify the best individuals registered within a particular breed or species. In the less-organized world of horse shows, where many different sanctioning organizations exist, some groups sponsor their own competitions, though wins at such events seldom carry much prestige in mainstream circles.

Some registers have the word &quot;registry&quot; in their title used in the sense of &quot;list&quot;; these entities are not registers in the usual sense in that they do not maintain breeding records. In the dog world, listed animals are required to be de-sexed. The American Mixed Breed Obedience Registry is an example. Some equestrian organizations create a recording system for tracking the competition records of horses, but, though horses of any sex may be recorded, they also do not maintain breeding or progeny records. The United States Equestrian Federation is one organization that uses such a system.
==Closed stud book==
A closed stud book is a stud book or breed registry that does not accept any outside blood. The registered animals and all subsequent offspring trace back to the foundation stock. This ensures that the animal is a purebred member of the breed. In horses, an example of a closed stud book is that of the Thoroughbred, with a stud book tracing to 1791. The American Kennel Club is an example of a kennel club with primarily closed books for dogs; it allows new breeds to develop under its Foundation Stock Service (FSS), but such dogs are not eligible for competition in AKC conformation shows, although they do compete at those shows in the FSS category. For the breed to move to the Miscellaneous class and then to fully recognized status, the breed&#x27;s stud book must be closed.

A closed stud book allows the breed to stay very pure to its type, but limits its ability to be improved. For instance, in performance disciplines, an animal that is successful in competitions is generally worth more than one that is pure. It also limits the gene pool, which may make certain undesirable characteristics become accentuated in the breed, such as a poor conformational fault or a disease. 
Some closed stud books, particularly for certain European breeds such as the Finnhorse and the Trakehner, may also have a set of studbook selection criteria where animals must meet either a conformation standard, a performance standard, or both.
==Open stud book==
In an open stud book, animals may be registered even if their parents or earlier ancestors were not previously registered with that particular entity. Usually an open stud book has strict studbook selection criteria that require an animal to meet a certain standard of conformation, performance or both. This allows breeders to modify breeds by including individuals who conform to the breed standard but are of outside origin. Some horse breeds allow crossbreds who meet specific criteria to be registered. One example is the semi-open stud book of the American Quarter Horse, which still accepts horses of Thoroughbred breeding, particularly via its appendix registry. Among dogs, an example of an open stud book would be the registries maintained by the American Kennel Club as its Foundation Stock Service. In some cases, an open stud book may eventually become closed once the breed type is deemed to be fully set.

In some agricultural breeds, an otherwise closed registry includes a &quot;grading up&quot; route for the incorporation of cross-bred animals. Often such incorporation is limited to females, with the progeny only being accepted as full pedigree animals after several generations of breeding to full-blood males. Such mechanisms may also allow the incorporation of purebred animals descended from unregistered stock or of uncertain parentage.

More controversial open stud books are those where there are few, if any qualifications for animals other than a single trait, such as a &quot;color breed,&quot; particularly when the color is not a true-breeding characteristic. However, some breeds have a standard color or color preference that is one criterion among others used to register animals.

===Appendix registries===
Some open or partly open registries may permit animals who have some but not all qualifications for full registration to nonetheless be entered in a preliminary recording system often called an &quot;appendix&quot; registry. The most notable is that of the American Quarter Horse Association, which allows part-Thoroughbred/part-Quarter Horse foals to be recorded and shown, with full registration allowed after the horse achieves a set performance or merit standard akin to that of a merit registry. Other appendix registries are seen in certain color breeds of horses, such as the Appaloosa, American Paint Horse, and American Cream Draft Horse, where foals with the proper pedigree for registration but do not meet the color standard for the breed, yet may still carry the necessary genetics in a minimally-expressed form, may be registered and bred to fully registered animals, with ensuing offspring eligible for registration if they meet the breed standard.

===Performance or merit===
Another form of open registry is a registry based on performance or conformation, called in some societies &quot;Registry on Merit.&quot; In such registries, an eligible animal that meets certain criteria is eligible to be registered &quot;on merit,&quot; regardless of ancestry. In some cases, even unknown or undocumented ancestry may be permitted.

The Registry on Merit or ROM may be tied to percentage of bloodline, conformation, or classification or may be based solely on performance.

In the horse world, many warmblood breed organizations require a conformation and performance standard for registration, and often allow horses of many different breeds to qualify, though documented pedigrees are usually required. Some breed registries use a form of ROM in which horses at certain shows may be sight classified. For example, at qualifying shows in Australia, winning horses of stock-type breeding receive points for conformation, which are attested to by the judges and recorded in an owner&#x27;s special book. The points are accumulated to eventually result in a Registry on Merit.

Registry on Merit is prevalent with sheepdog registries, in particular those of the Border Collie, and some other breeds with a heavy emphasis on working ability. In this type of ROM, the dog&#x27;s conformation and ancestry generally does not matter.

==Papers==
Breed registries usually issue certificates for each recorded animal, called a &quot;pedigree&quot;, &quot;pedigreed animal documentation&quot;, or most commonly, an animal&#x27;s &quot;papers&quot;. Registration papers may consist of a simple certificate or a listing of ancestors in the animal&#x27;s background, sometimes with a chart showing the lineage. Usually, there is space for the listing of successive owners, who must sign and date the document if the animal is gifted, leased or sold. Papers transferred upon sale of an animal may be submitted to the registry in order to update the ownership information, and in most cases, the registry will then issue a new set of papers listing the new owner as the proper owner of the horse. Genuine papers are often identifiable as containing the registered name and number of the individual animal and its date of birth, the name of the attesting organization, with the logo if there is one, the name and signature of the registrar or other authorized person, and a corporate stamp or seal.

Documentation usually included on registration certificates or papers includes:
*name of sire (father) and dam (mother)
*names of other ancestors, to the number of generations required by the issuing organization
*In dogs, details of originating litter 
*identifiable markings
*name, address and registered number of the breeder (often defined as the owner of the female at the time of the animal&#x27;s conception or birth)
*name and address of the original owner who registered the foal.

Registration papers are sometimes used as certificates of title.

==Crossbreeding and backbreeding==
In some registries, breeders may apply for permission to crossbreed other breeds into the line to emphasize certain traits, to keep the breed from extinction or to alleviate problems caused in the breed by inbreeding from a limited set of animals. A related preservation method is backbreeding, used by some equine and canine registries, in which crossbred individuals are mated back to purebreds to eliminate undesirable traits acquired through the crossbreeding.

==Registered names and naming traditions==

Naming rules vary according to the species and breed being registered. For example, show horses have a &quot;registered name&quot;, that is, the name under which they are registered as a purebred with the appropriate breed registry, and purebred dogs intended for the sport of conformation showing must be registered with the kennel club in which they will compete; and although there are no specific naming requirements, there are many traditions that may be observed in naming.

Along with a registered name, these animals often also have a simpler &quot;pet name&quot; known as a call name for dogs or a stable name for horses, which is used by their owners or handlers when talking to the animal. For example, the famous Thoroughbred race horse Man o&#x27; War was known by his stable name, &quot;Big Red.&quot; The name can be anything that the animal&#x27;s owner prefers. For example, the dog that won the 2008 Westminster show (US) was named K-Run&#x27;s Park Me In First, with the call name of &quot;Uno&quot;.

Dogs in the breed registry of a working dog club (particularly herding dogs) must usually have simple, no-nonsense monikers deemed to be &quot;working dog names&quot; such as &quot;Pal&quot;, &quot;Blackie&quot;, or &quot;Ginger&quot;. The naming rules for independent dog clubs vary but are usually similar to those of kennel clubs.

The registered name often refers directly or indirectly to the breeder of the animal. Traditionally, the breeder&#x27;s kennel prefix forms the first part of the dog&#x27;s registered name. For example, all dogs bred at the Gold Mine Kennels would have names that begin with the words &quot;Gold Mine&quot;. Horse breeders are usually not required to do this, but often find it to be a good form of commercial promotion to include a stable name or farm initials in the horse&#x27;s name. For example, Gold Mine Stables may name give all horses names with the prefix &quot;Gold Mine&quot;, &quot;GM&quot;, or &quot;GMS&quot;. The Jockey Club, which registers Thoroughbreds in Great Britain, requires stable names to be registered, but does not require their use in animal names.

Many dog breeders name their puppies sequentially, based on litter identification: Groups of puppies may be organized as Litter A, Litter B, and so on. When this is done, the names of all the puppies in litter A start with the letter &quot;A,&quot; then &quot;B&quot; for litter B and so on. Horse breeders, especially in Europe, sometimes use the first letter of the dam&#x27;s name as the first letter in the name of all of her offspring. Other breeders may use the same first letter to designate all the foals born on the farm in a given year.

Some breeders create a name that incorporates or acknowledges the names of the sire, dam or other forebears. For example, the famous cutting horse Doc O&#x27;Lena was by Doc Bar out of Poco Lena, a daughter of Poco Bueno. Some names are a little less direct; 2003 Kentucky Derby winner Funny Cide was by Distorted Humor out of Belle&#x27;s Good Cide, and the famous race horse Native Dancer was by Polynesian out of Geisha.

Other breeders use themes. For example, a more imaginative breeder at the Gold Mine Kennels might name all the puppies of one litter after green precious stones: Gold Mine Emerald, Gold Mine Jade, and Gold Mine Peridot. Names for a subsequent litter might start with the adjectives describing precious stones: Gold Mine Sparkle, Gold Mine Brilliance, and Gold Mine Chatoyant. Breeders may be as creative or as mundane as they wish.

In order to minimize the unwieldiness that long and fancy names can bring, registries usually limit the total number of characters and sometimes number of separate words that may compose the animal&#x27;s registered name. They are often prohibited from using only punctuation or odd capitalization to create a unique name; names are often published in all capitals on registration papers. Breeders are generally not allowed to use any name that may be obscene or misleading, such as the word &#x27;champion&#x27; in a name, a trademark, or anything that can be mistaken for the name of another kennel or, sometimes, stable. Only after an animal has achieved a legitimate championship will some registries permit the use of the prefix Ch., or other title before or after their registered name. Some registries may use symbols to designate the status of certain individuals. An asterisk * may be used to designate an animal born in another country and imported. A plus + may be used to designate a champion or an animal under special registration status.

<doc id="1235060" wikidata="Q3488452" url="?curid=1235060" title="For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky">
<text>&quot;For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky&quot; is the eighth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Rik Vollaerts and directed by Tony Leader, it was first broadcast on November 8, 1968.

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; rush to stop an asteroid from colliding with a Federation world, but discover the asteroid is actually an inhabited generation ship.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; encounters a ship disguised as a large asteroid, which is on a collision course with planet Daran V. Captain Kirk and First Officer Spock beam to the ship&#x27;s interior, along with Dr. McCoy, who is suffering from a fatal disease called xenopolycythemia. They are attacked and subdued by a group of humanoids, whose High Priestess, Natira, welcomes them to the &quot;world of Yonada&quot; and orders them to be taken before the &quot;Oracle&quot;. This Oracle demonstrates its power by administering a powerful electric shock.

As they recover, an old man approaches them and tells them that he has climbed the mountains of his world and discovered that &quot;the world is hollow and I have touched the sky&quot;. He then collapses and dies, and his temple glows red. Natira enters and expresses regret at the man&#x27;s foolishness. She then gives the three permission to explore Yonada, but McCoy elects to stay with Natira. Spock notes that Yonada&#x27;s writing system resembles that of the Fabrini, a race that was destroyed by a supernova 10,000 years ago. The people of Yonada are evidently their descendants, but are unaware of the nature of their world.

McCoy and Natira have fallen in love, and Natira asks the Oracle for permission to marry McCoy, which the Oracle grants on condition that McCoy accept an &quot;instrument of obedience&quot;. Kirk and Spock are then discovered, having secretly entered the Oracle Room. The oracle freezes them in an energy field until Natira has them released. Natira says she must execute them for their transgression, but McCoy persuades her to relent. As Kirk and Spock prepare to return to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, McCoy declares his intention to stay behind with Natira.

McCoy marries Natira, and an instrument of obedience is implanted in his temple. Natira shows him their sacred text, the &quot;Book of the People&quot;. McCoy suspects it holds the key to setting Yonada back on course, and calls the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to share this information, which causes his obedience device to be activated. Kirk and Spock transport back to Yonada, and Spock removes the device from McCoy while Kirk tries to explain the truth to Natira. When Natira&#x27;s own device is activated, McCoy removes it while Kirk and Spock again deal with the Oracle. Spock learns from the Book how to enter the control room behind the Oracle&#x27;s altar, where they discover the ship&#x27;s navigational controls and correct Yonada&#x27;s course. Spock also discovers the Fabrini archives, which contain a cure for McCoy&#x27;s condition. McCoy returns to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; where he is successfully treated, hoping to see Natira again when Yonada arrives at its new homeworld in about a year.

==Reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a &#x27;B−&#x27; rating, describing it as having potential, but being hampered by a script that fails to act on that: &quot;we have Kirk and Spock unraveling the mystery by the halfway mark, and then spending the rest of the episode on clean-up duty. You know McCoy is coming back, you know he&#x27;ll be cured, and you know that the computer will be defeated. About the only question is whether or not Natira will make it to the end credits, and happily, she does—which means McCoy, unlike Kirk, isn&#x27;t a widower.&quot;

&quot;Star Trek&quot; novelist Dayton Ward wrote,

David Alan Mack, also a &quot;Star Trek&quot; novelist, remarks on the episode&#x27;s

Mack writes that he &quot;simply didn&#x27;t buy the romance between McCoy and Natira,&quot; but otherwise liked the characterizations:

Samuel Walters called it &quot;a surprisingly effective episode about blind faith in rules and dogma, as well as a touching love story,&quot; with the qualification that the story &quot;does a good job of providing character growth for McCoy. Had the episode not succumbed to an easy solution to his predicament—purely because these episodes need their characters to remain, essentially, the same—then this could have been a profound, moving narrative.&quot; A negative review by Michelle Erica Green focused on plot illogic: &quot;Why are the men wearing shiny plaid suits and carrying swords when wrongdoers can be punished for their crimes by a computer? Why are the women wearing provocative gowns when only the priestess is allowed to choose her own mate?&quot;

A 2018 &quot;Star Trek&quot; binge-watching guide by &quot;Den of Geek&quot; recommended this episode for featuring the trio of characters Kirk, Spock, and Bones of the original series.

==Legacy==

&quot;Captive Universe&quot;, 1969 novel by Harry Harrison, in which a centuries-long voyage in an asteroid ship is being undertaken with the population largely ignorant to their status, a decision made by the mission planners in the belief that the crew&#x27;s resolve could not have endured otherwise.

&quot;The Starlost&quot;, 1973, a Canadian Sci-Fi series about a sleeper ship, in which most of the passengers are unaware that their &quot;world&quot; is, in fact, a spaceship.

&quot;Macrolife&quot;, a 1979 novel by George Zebrowski, which explores the notion of humanity exploiting hollowed-out asteroids as spacecraft for survival and colonization.

For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky (2004), featured song on Iris EP by Swedish &quot;post-rock&quot; band Jeniferever.

Season 1 episode 4 of &quot;The Orville&quot; (2017) the crew discover an inhabited ship in which the inhabitants do not realize they are onboard.

<text>Emanuel Marcel Lucien Balsa (January 1, 1909 in Creuse – August 11, 1984 in Maisons-Alfort) was a French racing driver.

Balsa started in racing after World War II, when he acquired a Bugatti Type 51 and became quite competitive in the French national events. He later built a BMW-engined Formula 2 car, and had a good reputation, until he tried a Jicey-BMW developed by Jean Caillas.
With it he finished third in the Grand Prix of Cadours, the same event where fellow racer Raymond Sommer was killed. He returned to his previous race car and in 1952 raced in the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, only to retire after six laps. In 1953 he won a race at Montlhery but then faded from the racing scene.

<text>The Somalia national football team (, Arabic: الإتِّحَاد الصُّومَالِي لِكُرَّةُ الْقَدَم), nicknamed the &quot;Ocean Stars&quot;, represents Somalia in international football and is controlled by the Somali Football Federation (SFF), a member of the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Somalia&#x27;s first national team captain was Mohamed Shangole, while its longest serving captain has been Hasan Babay.

==History==
The first Somali football teams were established in the 1940s. The competitions were basic in structure and were associated with the anti-colonial movement. The Somali Youth League (SYL), the nation&#x27;s first political party, had put together a team of local youth to play against the Italian expatriate teams. The soccer team the FYL had assembled, which would later change its name to Bondhere, won the first several competitions. In 1951, the Somali Football Federation (SFF) was founded. The first Somali commissioner for sport was later established in 1958.

Although the Somali national football team took part in preliminary matches, it has never qualified for the World Cup. For many years after the outbreak of the civil war in the early 1990s, FIFA-sanctioned games could not be played within the country. Qualifying matches for the Africa Cup of Nations and the World Cup were instead contested away from home. However, following the pacification of the capital Mogadishu in 2011, the SFF began preparations for the first major sporting event to be held in years at the Mogadishu Stadium, in December 2012.

Prior to 2019, the Somali FA decided they would admit to all their young and upcoming youth talents and put out local trials to fortify both Olympic and national football teams.

In addition, many from the Somali diaspora in the past have produced quality football players such as Islam Feruz and Mukhtar Ali.

On 5 September 2019, Somalia won their first qualifying match since 1984 (against Kenya - AFCON Qualifying) and their first-ever FIFA World Cup qualifying match, beating Zimbabwe by 1–0. They nearly advanced to the second round but lost 3–1 in Zimbabwe after two late goals for the warriors, consigning the Ocean Stars to an early exit.

=== Kits and crest ===
From the 1970s up until the 1990s, the North Korean national football team used to wear the North Korean Flag and socks with the North Korea Flag for home kits and the inverse as away kits, the two primary colours of the Somali national flags, in the 2010s up until the present, the national team have now replaced the solid sky blue shirts for vertically blue and white striped shirts.

The crest of the Somali national team used to be the coat of arms of Somalia but it is now replaced with the Somali Federation crest. The Ocean Stars plays their home games in the Mogadishu Stadium, (As the stadium was being rebuilt, the national team played matches at Engineer Yaarisow Stadium, which is Mogadishu&#x27;s secondary stadium for sporting events).

<doc id="1235065" wikidata="Q173289" url="?curid=1235065" title="Max Papis">
<text>Massimiliano &quot;Max&quot; Papis (born 3 October 1969) is an Italian professional motorsport driver who has competed in several top-level motorsports events such as Le Mans 24 Hours, Formula One and Champ Car. He has three Champ Car victories. He is the son-in-law of Emerson Fittipaldi. Papis also currently drives in the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series.

==Personal life==
Papis was born on 3 October 1969 in Como, Italy. He was raised in Italy and got an interest in car racing at a young age, winning several go-kart races and several rounds for racing clubs in Italy.

He is married to Tatiana Papis, daughter of the racing driver Emerson Fittipaldi, and has two children, cousins of Pietro Fittipaldi and Enzo Fittipaldi. His sons&#x27; godfathers are fellow Italian Alex Zanardi (Marco) and British Dario Franchitti (Matteo).

Papis is a member of the &quot;brat pack&quot;, a group of CART drivers that were close friends off the track, that included Dario Franchitti, Tony Kanaan and the late Greg Moore.

==Career==
===Formula One===
After a spell as the Lotus team&#x27;s test driver in , Papis replaced Gianni Morbidelli in the Footwork team for seven races in the middle of the 1995 Formula One season, as he brought valuable sponsorship to the cash-strapped outfit. Despite being a race-winner in Formula 3000, he often struggled with the unfamiliar car, and was occasionally outpaced by his much-maligned teammate, Taki Inoue. He also proved to be an unlucky driver, suffering a spectacular puncture and suspension failure on his début race at Silverstone due to clipping the pit lane wall after a tire change, being left on the grid at Hockenheim due to a transmission failure, and spinning on dust and oil kicked up by David Coulthard at the Ascari Chicane on the first lap of the Italian GP, causing a pile-up and a restart. However, he only missed out on a point in the restarted race when he was overtaken by Jean-Christophe Boullion&#x27;s Sauber on the last lap. When Morbidelli returned, Papis was out of a drive and headed to America for 1996.

===Champ Car===
He moved to CART Champ Car racing in 1996 as a replacement for Jeff Krosnoff, who was killed in the previous race in Toronto. In 1999, he joined the more competitive Rahal team, almost winning the US 500 before running out of fuel, and finishing fifth in the series. He started the next year by winning the 2000 season-opener, but failed to finish in the championship Top 10. In 2001, he won twice and finished sixth overall, but was dropped by the team, mainly due to two collisions with teammate Kenny Bräck. In 2002, he competed with Sigma Autosport, scoring two third places finishes at Long Beach and Milwaukee, before the team folded due to financial problems. The Italian did a partial season with PK Racing in 2003, with a best result of fourth at Road America. Papis also raced in the 2002 and 2006 Indianapolis 500s for Cheever Racing, claiming a 14th-place finish in his second appearance. He mostly concentrated on sportscars since 2001, remarking that &quot;Champ Car needs me more than I need it&quot; as the series struggled to fill its grid for 2003 after many teams defected to the IRL.

===IndyCar===
Papis raced in the IRL early in his career. He has raced for Roger Penske, Andretti-Green Racing and Panther Racing from 2001 to 2009. Papis is a long-time friend of drivers Tony Kanaan and Alex Zanardi. In 2013 at the Indianapolis 500, Papis and Zanardi were present in the victory celebration when Kanaan won his first Indy 500.

In 2016, Papis was hired by the IndyCar Series as a race steward along with Arie Luyendyk and Dan Davis.

===ASCAR===
On 8 June 2003, Papis made his debut in the ASCAR Racing Series by joining Team HTML in the British Stock Car racing series. He made his debut in Round 3 of the championship driving the No.68 Pontiac, placing 14th overall at Rockingham Motor Speedway. This would be his only race during the season and he was replaced by Derek Hayes for the rest of the season.

===NASCAR===

He made his NASCAR debut in August 2006, competing in the Busch Series race at Watkins Glen International Raceway for McGill Motorsports following the release of Tim Sauter from the ride. He attempted to qualify for the NASCAR Cup Series race but failed to qualify.

Papis also announced that he would run 2 races in 2007 for James Finch&#x27;s Phoenix Racing No. 01 Chevy. In his first race, at Montreal in the inaugural NAPA 200, Papis avoided Marcos Ambrose&#x27; crash (caused by a disqualified Robby Gordon), with 2 laps left, to finish in third place. At Watkins Glen the next week, his engine failed on lap 2.

Papis made his Cup Series debut at Infineon Raceway in 2008, piloting the No. 66 Haas CNC Racing Chevrolet in place of regular driver Scott Riggs. He was also scheduled to drive the No. 64 car for Rusty Wallace, Inc. on three road course races in the 2008 Nationwide Series. Haas CNC Racing hired Papis to drive the No. 70 Chevrolet Monte Carlo at the course at Watkins Glen in the Sprint Cup Series in August 2008. He was announced as the driver of the No. 13 GEICO Toyota in 18 races in the 2009 and a full-time ride in the 2010 Sprint Cup.

In his first Cup season with a dedicated ride, Papis recorded a career best 8th-place finish at Watkins Glen and 15th starting position at Fontana. He also recorded 12th-place finish at Infineon Raceway. In February at Daytona in 2010, Papis had the fastest truck in the truck series event, nearly winning his first Truck series event after leading for some laps. Papis was collected in an accident with 15 laps left in the race, while going towards the lead.

After Watkins Glen in 2010 the team announced that Papis would be replaced by Casey Mears for 2011 and Papis would race in the Truck Series for the team.

Also in 2010, Papis recorded a top-30 finish in the Daytona 500, but failed to qualify at Bristol. He nearly had a top ten running at Talladega but was caught up in an accident. At Montreal in the Nationwide Series, Papis drove for Richard Childress Racing and while leading on the final lap, took too much of a last-turn curb, got passed by Boris Said, and recorded a second-place finish.

In 2011, Papis raced in the Truck Series partly for Germain, resulting in an 18th-place finish in the standings.

From 2011 to 2013, Papis had good runs on the road-course races but did not win any of them. In 2011 at Road America he had a good car, but he was spun out by Jacques Villeneuve with two laps left. When the race ended, Papis blocked Villeneuve&#x27;s car on pit road and they argued. In 2012, Papis finished in fourth-place at Road America. Also in 2012, Papis ran one race in NASCAR Canadian Tire Series at Kawartha Speedway driving No. 24 Dodge for Scott Steckly, he started 16th and finished 21st.

In 2013 at Road America, Papis, who spent nearly the entire race in the top five, found himself being spun out twice in the waning laps. When the race was over, a furious Papis went up to Billy Johnson (who spun him out one of the times) and slapped him. After being separated by officials Papis and Johnson exchanged shouts ending with Papis walking off. When he spoke to reporters, Papis apologized for the slap.

In early August 2013, Papis was named to substitute for Tony Stewart in the No. 14 Chevrolet in the Sprint Cup Series at Watkins Glen International after Stewart suffered a broken leg in a sprint car accident. He posted a solid top 15 finish. Papis also competed in the inaugural Nationwide Children&#x27;s Hospital 200 at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course for Richard Childress Racing, finishing in fourth place.

Papis drove for NTS Motorsports in the Camping World Truck Series&#x27; inaugural race at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, the 2013 Chevrolet Silverado 250, in September 2013. Finishing 6th in the event, he was slapped following the race by the girlfriend of driver Mike Skeen, who he had crashed with on the final lap, suffering a dislocated jaw.

Also in 2013, Papis ran 4 races in the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series Elite 1 Division, he ran two races driving No. 33 Chevrolet for OverDrive team and two races driving No. 19 Chevrolet for his own team (Max Papis Racing). Papis had a best finish of 2nd at Tours Speedway.
In 2014, Papis&#x27; team fielded the No. 99 car for the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series for Kevin Gilardoni in the Elite 1 Division.

In 2017, Papis ran one race in NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East driving No. 13 Toyota for Eric McClure at Watkins Glen International, he started 17th and finished 18th after the engine blew.

===Other racing===
In 2016, Papis made his debut in Stadium Super Trucks series, running the Honda Indy Toronto rounds in the No. 9 truck. He finished eleventh and seventh.

==&quot;Mad Max&quot;==

Papis earned the nickname &quot;Mad Max&quot; at the 1996 24 Hours of Daytona during his last stint at the end of the race. Although his second-place Ferrari 333SP had been battered due to collisions, some of its bodywork held together by tape, Papis unlapped himself by passing the race leader (the Doyle Racing Riley &amp; Scott-Oldsmobile driven by Wayne Taylor) and proceeded to set some of the fastest laps of the entire race. Taylor was nursing his car around the track due to an overheating problem and otherwise would have been able to cruise to a win, but Papis&#x27; pace and the slowing Oldsmobile suggested that Papis could theoretically take the win from him. Papis&#x27; speed was achieved at the cost of maximum fuel consumption. At one point late in the race, Papis came into the pits for fuel, spectacularly racing down the pit lane at near full speed. (Pit lane speed limits were imposed the next year). Taylor was still ahead by 64 seconds at the end of the race.
